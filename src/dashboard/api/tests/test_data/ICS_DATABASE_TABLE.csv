 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Srivas Chennu and Howard Bowman have developed a software tool for improving the diagnosis of conscious awareness in patients after severe brain injury, based on their research into using neural signal processing methods for quantifying human brain networks. Since 2016 the software tool has been deployed across two residential care homes in Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, a world\-leading European assessment centre in Belgium, and a rehabilitation centre in Germany. Across these locations, it has been used to measure awareness at the bedside of 200\+ patients. The EEG software has improved assessments by allowing clinicians to form a detailed profile of a patient’s cognitive function, and as a bedside tool it has advanced care practice by averting the need for transportation, while also providing a digital visualisation of the brain’s activity, which improves understanding amongst patients’ families and carers. As highlighted by one clinician, the tool is ‘significantly reducing the cost of care and specialist assessments by many thousands of pounds, while simultaneously improving timeliness and efficacy’ **\[c\].**

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Overview** 

 There is currently little reliable data on the number of patients in prolonged disorders of consciousness in the UK. Estimates vary widely, with between 4,000\-16,000 patients diagnosed to be in a vegetative state, and three times as many in minimally conscious states. Because diagnosing and treating such patients poses a serious clinical challenge to neurorehabilitation specialists and clinicians, levels of consciousness can be misdiagnosed in as many as 40% of vegetative state patients. 

 Chennu and Bowman’s research is transforming how such patients are assessed, managed and diagnosed. The team began researching computational methods for quantifying human brain networks in **2006** **\[R1\]**. In **2010**, Chennu took up a postdoctoral research post elsewhere, while Bowman continued the work at Kent **\[R2\].** Following Chennu’s return to Kent in **2016**, the pair continued to develop their research together, with support from a Kent team of a Research Associate and a PhD student. The work was also supported by a grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council awarded to Chennu **\[G1\].** 

 Their research demonstrated that following non\-invasive bedside measurements of electrical brain activity, computational analysis can uncover consciousness in patients who otherwise might seem unaware **\[R3, R4, R5, R6\].**  This research led Chennu and Bowman to develop a software tool for analysing electrical brain activity measured at the patient’s bedside. The Kent team worked in collaboration with clinicians at a range of institutions who since **2017** have deployed the software tool and collected feedback data to further improve the tool. 

 **Development of the underpinning research** 

 Chennu and Bowman’s research involves adapting neural signal processing methods for quantifying human brain networks. Human brain network activity is the basis for the quantification of consciousness and is central to the improvement of diagnosis and rehabilitation plans. The foundations for this research were published in **2009** **\[R1\]** and since then the research has been refined and elaborated and the software tool developed. 

 Since **2016,** Chennu and Bowman have built upon this work, combining neural signal processing, machine learning, and computational analysis of electrical brain activity to characterise the interaction between attention and consciousness. The work was developed for clinical application by showing that analysis of electrical brain activity could uncover hidden awareness in some patients with so\-called disorders of consciousness following severe brain injury, even though these patients might seem unresponsive at the bedside **\[R3\]**. 

 This computational methodology was validated in three complementary ways: first, using phase synchrony for the identification of consciousness states between coma and quasi\-brain\-death **\[R2\]**; then using large\-scale datasets of brain activity acquired from clinical settings **\[R3\]**; and, most recently, using brain activity recorded during anaesthetic\-induced unconsciousness **\[R6\]**. In particular, **\[R6\]** characterised the brain network’s underlying transitions from full consciousness to reduced awareness. Across this network, brain\-scale patterns of activation drive the signatures of awareness used, for example, in output **\[R3\]** to assess consciousness. 

 **Application of the research through EEG software** 

 Based on the findings of this underpinning research, between **2016** and **2017** Chennu and Bowman made advances towards developing a software tool for analysing electrical brain activity measured at the patient’s bedside to index their level of consciousness automatically, without requiring any behavioural responses from the patient. 

 The software tool involves using high\-density electroencephalography \(EEG\) to measure electrical brain activity at the patient’s bedside; the software analyses these recordings and produces an assessment of the patient’s brain function and a digital visualisation of the brain’s activity. The results of the assessments can then be used to develop a detailed brain\-based profile of the patient's state of awareness and cognitive function and to formulate an individualised care and therapy plan for the patient. 

 In **2018,** the EEG software tool was deployed in a clinical trial of therapeutic intervention to aid the recovery of patients after severe brain injury **\[R4\]**. During the trial, the tool was used to measure the efficacy of electrical stimulation therapy in individual patients by assessing them with the software before and after the stimulation. 

 More recently, research has demonstrated the viability of routine deployment of the EEG software tool in clinical rehabilitation centres for repeatable and regular assessments of patients **\[R5\]**. This later work demonstrated that the software can be valuable for augmenting standard behavioural assessments of consciousness in the clinic, by diagnosing current levels of awareness and predicting longer\-term recovery.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The EEG software tool was first deployed in **2016**, on 40 patients at two residential care homes in Cambridgeshire \(Askham Village Community, Doddington\) and Hertfordshire \(Gardens and Jacobs long\-term residential rehabilitation centres in Sawbridgeworth\) **\[c, e, f, g\]**. Since then, its rollout has gathered significant momentum, involving a further 160\+ patients at the Coma Science Group in Liege, Belgium, \( **2017\-present**\) **\[b\]**; and 26 patients at the Therapiezentrum Burgau rehabilitation centre in Germany \( **2018\-present**\) **\[d\]**. 

 The results of the EEG software assessments allow clinicians to form a detailed brain\-based profile of a patient's state of awareness and cognitive function. This allows more tailored care and therapy to best meet the needs of the individual patients. The tool has made a significant impact on clinicians, patients and their families in the UK and Europe, by: 

-  advancing the clinical approach to brain activity assessments, 

-  improving severe brain injury rehabilitation and care practices, and 

-  increasing understanding and involvement amongst patients’ families. 

 The co\-director of Europe’s leading centre for clinical assessment, management and treatment of patients diagnosed with prolonged disorder of consciousness \(Coma Science Group\) explains how ‘The adoption of the technology has informed our knowledge, patients’ families understanding, and, most importantly, the overall care of the patients we treat’ **\[b\].** 

 **Advancing clinical assessments** 

 Feedback from clinical staff indicates that the EEG software tool has had a significant practical impact on the assessment of brain activity in severely ill patients. For example, the Professor of Anaesthesia at Addenbrookes Hospital has described how the software has ‘advanced the clinical practice of brain activity assessments, improving practitioners’ and specialists’ understanding of the recovery of consciousness after severe brain injury’ **\[c\].** 

 One of the UK’s leading clinical experts in neurorehabilitation has stated that not only is the technology ‘helping to inform clinical practice in real\-life settings across several specialist hospitals in the UK and Europe, with the potential for more on the horizon’, but also noted that she has ‘benefitted from its value in allowing me and those I work with to more accurately quantify the level of activity associated with consciousness’ **\[a\].** She highlighted how the research ‘has fostered new knowledge around how brain activity assessments can reduce the rate of misdiagnosis of consciousness’ and is informing ‘our current thinking for how to make the technology more readily available to patients and advance what we do in the future’ **\[a\].** 

 **Advancing rehabilitation and care practices** 

 Prior to the uptake of the EEG software tool, many of the patients in the Cambridgeshire care setting were treated at Addenbrooke’s during the acute period after an injury, before being transferred to the centre for prolonged rehabilitation. The transferral process made patient follow\-ups more difficult as it required bringing them back for frequent assessments and intervention. In his supporting letter, the Professor of Anaesthesia from Addenbrooke’s explains how the software has ‘bridg\[ed\] this clinical and translational gap between acute and chronic stages of recovery after brain injury by facilitating a way to manage patients at their bedside and avert the need for transportation’ **\[c\].** In addition, he states that: ‘Using Dr Chennu’s technology, clinicians have been able to identify the most useful time points during a patient’s rehabilitation when they can benefit from such scans, thereby significantly reducing the cost of care and specialist assessments by many thousands of pounds, while simultaneously improving timeliness and efficacy’ **\[c\].** 

 Describing the changes made to their clinical practice as a result of the EEG software tool, the co\-director of the Coma Science group explains that ‘the technology’s capacity to assess patients alongside other brain\-based assessments like magnetic resonance imaging \[which\] has improved and often guided the care of our patients, thereby also informing our clinical decision\-making and its outcomes’ **\[b\]**. He states that ‘Dr. Chennu’s research and expertise \[…\] is useful to us as clinicians in informing how we can respond to the challenges faced in caring for patients with brain injury, as the tool that his work has led to is both easy\-to\-use and also improves the processes of our care’ **\[b\].** 

 A survey of families of patients at two of the participating rehabilitation centres corroborates this impact on the care received by patients. Responses highlighted how ‘It is much better to have the EEG at the bedside it does not interfere with the care of my relative,’ and ‘No disruption is caused to \[the patient’s\] routine’ **\[h\].** 

 Similarly, a survey of clinical staff across the two centres established that the software tool allowed clinicians ‘to consider the patients conscious state in more depth and provide more beneficial interaction’ and ‘reduces risks for patients – risk of infection for transport/moving, pressure sores, more convenient, less disruption to patient’s normal routine’ **\[i\].** 

 **Increasing families’ understanding and involvement** 

 By including a digital visualisation of the brain’s activity in a way that previous methods could not, South Newton hospital’s clinical expert believes that the EEG software tool ‘improves both the clinician and patients’ family and carers understanding of a patient’s brain activity’ **\[a\].** She confirms that the technology has ‘enabled me and my colleagues to more easily communicate the meaning and impact of these assessments to the patients’ family and carers. Further, it often increases the extent of their understanding of the patient’s diagnosis/situation’ **\[a\].** 

 This beneficial impact on families’ involvement and understanding is supported by clinicians at the Coma Science Group **.** Because the software has identified a minimal state of conscious despite a patient’s behaviour indicating an unresponsive wakeful state, for instance, not only have clinicians in Liege ‘then proposed to intensify care’ but also ‘in such contexts, together with the family \[they\] have used the findings to inform and discuss’ patient treatment options’ **\[b\].** The technology, they argue, ‘enhances the capacity for collaborative thinking with patient families and is a valued port of information amongst all parties, as it is often combined with the knowledge that patients’ families have of the patient to establish a best cumulative purview of the whole situation’ **\[b\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Christopher Cook’s research on spirituality and religion in psychiatry has emphasised that psychiatry should undertake a constructive and nuanced engagement with spirituality, defined broadly, and that this should be reflected in good clinical practice. This has had impact on debate and policy on 4 continents: Africa, Australasia, Europe, and North America. Between August 2013 and December 2020, 5 national psychiatric associations have introduced or are revising their policies, following the lead of the 2011 Royal College of Psychiatrists \(RCPsych\) policy initiated and drafted by Cook. Recommendations of the World Psychiatric Association \(WPA\) position statement, introduced in 2015, draw directly upon Cook’s work. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Psychiatry in the UK no longer relies on a purely bio\-medical model. In addition to social and psychological factors, spirituality and religion are increasingly seen as important. Cook has played a large part in this change. A growing evidence base shows that spirituality/religion can influence treatment outcomes and are important for ‘whole person’ care. However, in the pluralistic and secular context of modern healthcare, ‘spirituality’ is a controversial topic. Durham University has one of the few centres in the world to have engaged in critical theological contribution to these debates. 

 Cook is both a consultant psychiatrist and an Anglican priest, with research doctorates in medicine and theology, and with extensive pastoral and clinical experience. His research focuses on the relationships between spirituality, theology and health. He became a Professorial Research Fellow at St Chad’s College, Durham University, in 2003, and since 2005 has been based in the Department of Theology and Religion. In that year he established the Durham Project \(now Centre\) for Spirituality, Theology and Health, of which he is Director. Its stated aims are: 1. To promote interdisciplinary and collaborative research and teaching in the subject areas of spirituality, theology and health. 2. To contribute to discussion and policy processes both in churches and other religious communities and also within health and social care services. Since its inception, the Centre has collaborated with local NHS trusts and with relevant professional bodies. 

 Cook’s research gave rise to an integrative and inclusive definition of ‘spirituality’ \(R1\) which has been widely cited \(e.g. van Rensburg et al 2015, E4\) and is employed in the RCPsych position statement on spirituality/religion, \(R2\). The RCPsych \(membership approximately 18,800 people\) is the professional medical body responsible for setting and raising standards of psychiatry in the UK. RCPsych position statements are concise statements of College policy, providing the benchmark for good practice. The position statement on spirituality/religion was drafted by Cook, presented by him to the RCPsych policy committee, redrafted in the light of peer review, adopted as RCPsych policy in 2011, and updated by him in 2013. It makes recommendations concerning clinical assessment, psychiatric training, respect and sensitivity towards patients and colleagues, prohibition against proselytising, need for organisational policy, and joint working with clergy/chaplains. These recommendations draw on a broad evidence base, including Cook’s work exploring the implications of spirituality for practice with UK psychiatrists \(R5\). 

 In 2006, as a member of the Executive Committee of the Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group at the RCPsych \(SPSIG\), Cook drafted a position statement which was submitted to the Chair of the WPA Section on Religion, Spirituality and Psychiatry with a proposal that it might form the basis for WPA policy. In 2015, with a different introduction, but only slightly revised recommendations, this became the Position Statement for the WPA. 

 Further research by Cook has clarified the nature and dynamics of spirituality in different mental disorders and spirituality/religious experiences \(R3, R4\). Using Cook’s definition of spirituality as a starting point, *Spirituality and Psychiatry* \(R5\), published by RCPsych Press in 2009, was the first critical attempt by a group of British psychiatrists and mental health professionals to address spirituality/religion in clinical practice. The success of this book led to a sequel, *Spirituality and Narrative in Psychiatric Practice* \(R6\), also published by RCPsych, and more recently to an invitation from Cambridge University Press for an expanded and revised second edition \(in preparation\). These books, in all of which Cook has taken editorial leadership, demonstrate that a better understanding of the nature and place of spirituality in human wellbeing fosters a better understanding of mental disorder, and better care for patients.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 Cook’s research \(particularly R2\) has had impact on debate, policy and guidance on spirituality/religion in psychiatry internationally, both within the WPA and in national psychiatric associations. The evidence presented here is in respect of psychiatrists as the direct beneficiaries; indirectly the intention is that patients should be the ultimate beneficiaries. 

####  WPA 

 The WPA is a global association representing 140 psychiatric societies in 120 countries. It brings together approximately 250,000 psychiatrists, works collaboratively with international agencies, NGOs, and research institutions around the world, and shares a joint work program with the World Health Organization’s Department of Mental Health. WPA Position Statements present the views of the WPA on public health and social matters relevant to mental health. The *WPA Position Statement on Spirituality and Religion in Psychiatry* \(E1\) was approved by the WPA Executive Committee in 2015, and published in *World Psychiatry* \(Impact Factor 40.595, ranked 1/155 for psychiatric journals\) in 2016. 

 The WPA position statement explicitly acknowledges that it “has drawn on some of the text of recommendations already published \[in R2\]” \(E1\). The WPA and RCPsych position statements share common concerns and/or common text in 6 out of 7 of their respective recommendations, all based on Cook’s work \(E2\). 

 Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, Arabic, traditional and simplified Chinese translations of the WPA position statement are available on the WPA website \(E1\). Russian and Hindi translations have been prepared and will soon also be available. 

 Presentations on the WPA Position Statement, by Cook and others, have been made at many subsequent international conferences \(e.g. 2017 WPA Conference in Berlin, 2018 American Psychiatric Association \(APA\) conference in New York, 2019 conference of the WPA Section on Religion, Spirituality and Psychiatry in Jerusalem\). A special issue of *Mental Health, Religion and Culture* \(No. 6, 2017\) was devoted to the WPA Position Statement. 

 Writing to Cook, the President of the WPA says: 

 The Position Statement is a landmark in the field as we discussed at the Congress \[in Jerusalem\]. Your role as a leader and co\-author in that project was critical to its success, and required much dedication to achieving consensus in a field that has been sorely neglected. Thank you for your invaluable contribution to WPA and your colleagues in the Section, and hence to world psychiatry, though your commitment to the work. \(E3\) 

####  National psychiatric associations 

 Following the example of the RCPsych Position Statement \(R2\), four other national psychiatric associations published guidelines and policies on spirituality/religion: 

-  The South African Society of Psychiatrists \(SASOP\): *Guidelines for the integration of spirituality in the approach to psychiatric practice* \(2014, E4\) 

-  The Canadian Psychiatric Association \(approximately 2,200 members\) Position Paper: *Freedom of and From Religion* \(2014\) 

-  The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik und Nervenheilkunde \(DGPPN, 9,400 members\) Position Paper: *Dealing with Religiosity and Spirituality in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy* \(2017, E5\) 

-  The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists \(membership of approximately 6,700 people\) PS: *The Relevance of Religion and Spirituality to Psychiatric Practice* \(2018, E6\) 

 In all of these documents the RCPsych Position Statement \(R2\), and/or the WPA Position Statement \(E1\), is cited as context to the need for national policy/guidance. Even where the content of policy/guidance differs, there is evidence that the RCPsych/WPA position statements provided the stimulus to develop policy/guidance. For example, in the background to the SASOP guidelines, it is stated that: 

 It was important to develop South African guidelines in view of \[…\] guidelines provided by other associations \(e.g. Royal College of Psychiatrists\) \[...\]. \(E4\) 

 In the DGPPN position paper a whole paragraph is devoted to the RCPsych and its Position Statement \(E5\). The Chair of DGPPN writes: 

 The British position paper mainly written by Dr. Cook \(2013\) was our inspiration to formulate a similar statement for Germany. \(E7\) 

 Cook’s work has also had impact on the APA. The APA is the largest national psychiatric association in the world, with approximately 38,000 members practising in over 100 countries. The mission of the APA includes promotion of high\-quality care for people suffering from mental illness, advancement of psychiatric education, and research. In 1990, the Committee on Religion and Psychiatry of the APA published the first ever national guidelines on religion and psychiatry. These were last updated, as a *Resource Document on Religious/Spiritual Commitments and Psychiatric Practice*, in 2006. Cook’s work has provided the stimulus to drafting \(for the first time\) a Position Statement \(a more formal and authoritative policy\) on religion/spirituality in psychiatry and revising the Resource Document. The Position Statement is currently working its way through the relevant committees of the APA \(the next stage being early in 2021\). The Chair of the APA Caucus on Religion, Spirituality & Psychiatry writing to Cook, says: 

 Your leadership of the Royal College’s SIG has been an important inspiration to us in the APA’s Caucus on Religion, Spirituality and Psychiatry, and to me as its chair until this year. More specifically, your contribution to the RCPsych and WPA position statements on spirituality/religion have stimulated us to recently draft our own statement for the APA, and to consider updating its Resource Document in this area. The opportunity to discuss these issues on your visit to our 2018 meeting in the U.S., your invitation to me to participate in your meeting last November in London, and your active encouragement of international scholarship in spirituality/religion and psychiatry at global meetings such as the 2019 conference in Jerusalem have had a significant impact on my thinking and recommendations to our Caucus. \(E8\) 

 Cook is the 2021 recipient of the Oskar Pfister Award, given by the APA for outstanding contributions in the field of psychiatry and religion. **\[REDACTED\]** 

####  UK psychiatry 

 Cook continues to play an important part in the debate amongst UK psychiatrists, as evidenced by a recent editorial in the *British Journal of Psychiatry,* written jointly with two psychiatrists who hold views differing from his. \(E9\) 

 In September 2018, the RCPsych published *Person\-Centred Care: Implications for Training in Psychiatry*, which identified spirituality as one of the key elements of person\-centred care. Cook served as a member of the Scoping Group that produced the report. The report states: 

 Spirituality is concerned with human experiences of relatedness, meaning and purpose in life \(Cook, 2004\)…In clinical practice, it is important to show sensitivity and respect for the spiritual/religious beliefs and practices of people who use services as well as their families and carers. \[RCPsych position statement cited here\] \(E10\)

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Traditional drug development leads to drug doses that are sub\-optimal for >40% of patients, thereby increasing the risk of adverse effects and/or reducing efficacy. This highlights the need to tailor the dose to the individual. The Centre for Applied Pharmacokinetic Research \(CAPKR\) at the University of Manchester \(UoM\) has demonstrated significant inter\-individual variations in the level of drug\-handling proteins. Physiologically\-based pharmacokinetic \(PBPK\) modelling utilised by CAPKR has changed practice in drug development. PBPK is now: 

-  adopted by the global pharmaceutical industry, 

-  part of filing for drug approval to world leading regulatory agencies: \(USA, Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\); Europe, European Medicines Agency \(EMA\); UK, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\); and Japan, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency\), 

-  formally regulated by inclusion in FDA/EMA/MHRA guidance for industry. 

 These processes are now facilitating individualized drug dosing. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Individualised dosing \(the right dose for the right patient at the right time\) is crucial for the most efficacious use of medications while minimising the risk of harm. The drug development process has traditionally focused on a ‘one\-size\-fits\-all’ dose, based on a narrow subset of patients who may not be representative of the patient eventually receiving the drug in the real world. Over the last seven years members of CAPKR \(Rostami\-Hodjegan, Aarons, Galetin, Barber, Ogungbenro and Darwich\) alongside many top scientists from industry, academia and regulatory agencies, through professional bodies such as the American College of Clinical Pharmacology, indicated their concerns over the inadequacy of strategies for dose adjustment in special populations. Applications of PBPK modelling in CAPKR have demonstrated a range of opportunities to fill the gaps in stratified dosing \[1\]. 

 These changes were achieved by integrating *in vitro* data on drugs with the knowledge of the systems biology and physiology \(e.g. \[2\] in health and disease\). This approach has paved the way for combining various pieces of information on each different subset of patients with the aim of predicting the optimal dose in the absence of any clinical data \[3\]. 

 The research conducted at the UoM relevant to the impact can be summarised in three categories: 

1.  Establishment of drug\-independent physiological and pathophysiological systems attributes such as the abundance and activity of drug metabolising enzymes and transporters and their temporal changes in special patient populations, and identification of translational scaling factors based on microsomal and cytosolic protein measurements in various human tissues \(e.g., liver, intestine, brain and kidney\) \[2, 4\]. This allows quantitative translation of *in vitro* metabolism and transporter kinetic data into *in vivo* consequences. 

1.  Creation of mechanistic modelling frameworks for such translation e.g., extrapolation methodology for gut wall permeability, transporter\-mediated disposition in kidney \(particularly in patients with renal impairment\), assessment of metabolism\-transporter interplay in liver and corresponding drug\-drug interactions \(DDI\) \[3, 5\]. Complementary use of the clinical data and combining the so\-called ‘bottom\-up’ and ‘top\-down’ modelling has been advocated by CAPKR \[3\]. 

1.  Demonstration of translational modelling applications beyond typical healthy individuals to facilitate precision dosing \[6\]. The specific patient sub\-groups where CAPKR had produced *direct* and *unique* evidence for feasibility of PBPK is described in a variety of research articles and summarised in \[6\]. They include \(but are not restricted to\) neonates and young children, pregnant women, obese patients particularly those undergoing bariatric surgery and patients with chronic kidney disease. 

 All of the above underpins the role of CAPKR in increased application of PBPK modelling for drug label statements \(14 cases in 2019 alone; >60% of all approvals\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 Our research at the UoM has made a significant, direct and global impact in shifting the paradigm of drug development away from ‘one\-size\-fits\-all’ dosing strategies. CAPKR research has enabled exploration of new avenues to address dosage regimen requirements for special populations by integrating information regarding the system attributes \(abundance of enzymes/transporters\) into PBPK predictive models. In the words of the Deputy Director of the FDA Office of Clinical Pharmacology \(OCP\): 

 “*The CAPKR group has published several seminal pieces of novel research related to 'stratified medicine' particularly in paediatrics, pregnant women and obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery which have been very informative and led to actionable changes in drug development and patient care*.” \[Ai\]. 

 CAPKR has also delivered economic and ethical benefits via reducing the number of clinical studies. The testimonial by the Vice\-President and Global Head of Clinical Pharmacology at Pfizer states: 

 *“We typically conducted 25 to 40 or more clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate all these potential intrinsic and extrinsic factors for each new medicine before requesting regulatory approval. These studies add to the cost and time of developing new medicine and contribute to the escalating cost of new medicines for patients and tax payers around the world. We* \(now\) *make extensive use of PBPK models to inform our strategy about the necessity to conduct or avoid particular clinical pharmacology studies*.” \[Bi\]. 

##  Pathways to impact involved 

-  A close collaboration with the FDA \(under a Memorandum of Understanding Agreement signed by the Director of Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA \[C\]\), which has helped us translate the latest Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics \(DMPK\) science into practice under the Model\-Informed Drug Development \(MIDD\) approach. 

-  Regular site visits, and sabbatical stays at the FDA \(Galetin and Rostami\). 

-  Contributions as key opinion leaders in EMA/ FDA internal workshops/discussion panels \(Aarons, Galetin, Ogungbenro and Rostami\). 

-  Direct engagement with the senior leadership of Clinical Pharmacology and DMPK operations of pharmaceutical companies \[Bi\-Bv\]. 

-  Practical Pharma interaction via CAPKR membership to carry out pre\-competitive research \(up to GBP100,000 per annum per member\), and currently includes companies Eli Lilly, GSK, AbbVie, Merck\-Serono, Janssen, Merck\-Sharp & Dohme, Genentech and Takeda. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

 CAPKR’s translational modelling has been widely adopted by pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies. The impact can be viewed as follows: 

 **1. Individualized dosing.** The ‘one\-size\-fits\-all’ approach in drug development does not consider that individual responses of patients can vary significantly as a result of physiological/biological differences which stem from genetics, environment, ethnicity or age. Recognizing this challenge and to address these issues, the FDA held a workshop in August 2019 on ‘Precision Dosing’, a term first coined by CAPKR in 2016. From this the FDA released new guidance \(November 2020\) entitled ‘ *Enhancing the Diversity of Clinical Trial Populations*’ \[D\]. The guidance acknowledges that in traditional drug development certain populations are often excluded from trials without strong clinical / scientific rationale \(e.g. individuals with organ dysfunction\). It also indicates that failure to include participants with complex comorbidities in a development program may lead to a failure to discover important safety information. 

 Global health advocates \(Gates Foundation\) have also been a beneficiary of our research findings. The research has created the opportunity for developing new rational guidance for drug treatment in orphan disease groups such as pregnant patients in developing countries which are not studied as part of clinical drug development \[E\]. 

 **2. Modernising drug development and changing regulatory perspective.** Using PBPK modelling, CAPKR have shown how to evaluate and include individualized factors into a dosage regimen prior to conducting any clinical studies. Many PBPK predictive models are now implemented in commercial software \[F\] and incorporated into drug development practice within the pharmaceutical industry, encouraged by global regulators. The FDA position paper regarding disparity of the impact of DDI and genetic polymorphism in paediatrics vs. adults \[Gi\] is based directly on CAPKR’s research on variable ontogeny of drug metabolising enzymes and transporters. Furthermore, 2020 FDA Guidance for patients with renal impairment \[Gii\] considers the use of PBPK modelling for dose adjustment guidance which also links to CAPKR’s translational modelling in this patient cohort. 

 The implementation of these approaches as part of MIDD to inform new drug labels necessitated building confidence at a level where regulatory bodies could accept PBPK models in lieu of clinical studies. Between 2008\-2017, nearly 100 new drug applications containing PBPK analyses were submitted to the FDA OCP and the drug label for 70 of the approved cases had statements based on PBPK. The role of CAPKR in industrialising PBPK applications is indicated by testimonials from regulatory agencies \[Ai\], \[Aii\] and top leadership within global pharmaceutical companies \[Bi\-v\], e.g. Head of Quantitative Pharmacology & Pharmacometrics and Vice President, Merck: 

 *""CAPKR has an outstanding research record and pioneered innovative scientific approaches that have greatly impacted the methodologies for scientific approaches and review recommendations”.* \[Bii\]. 

 CAPKR research had a *‘direct’* impact on adoption of new regulatory practices and development of official guidance documents dealing with PBPK models \[Hi\], \[Hii\], indicated by the testimonial from the Pharmacokinetic Group Lead of the MHRA: 

 “… *they* \(CAPKR\) *have been influential in leading the outcomes \(bottom\-up and top\-down modelling\) which all ultimately contribute to some policy changes and regulatory guida*nce”. \[Aii\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Holocaust Research Institute at Royal Holloway has contributed substantially to bridging the gulf between scholarly and public understanding of the Holocaust. Its expertise and research have influenced strategic agendas regarding how the Holocaust is reassessed and remembered, informing how Holocaust history is presented in museums and how Holocaust education is delivered in schools and the media. Its work has guided decisions relating to the UK’s new Holocaust memorial, reshaped the Imperial War Museums’ much\-visited Holocaust Galleries, and helped drive the Wiener Holocaust Library’s strategy of communicating with the public via exhibitions and public events. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Holocaust Research Institute is the leading British research institute on the Holocaust and one of the most prominent in Europe and beyond. Its members produce high\-quality research on the causes, unfolding and aftermath of the Holocaust across several disciplines and disseminates that information to as wide an audience as possible. The research of its two Directors, Professor David Cesarani and Professor Dan Stone informs public understanding and commemoration of the Holocaust in numerous ways. 

 Cesarani’s research on the Nazi genocide of the Jews, underpinned by his wider analyses of European antisemitism, uniquely challenged the divide between the history of the Third Reich’s policies of persecution and the victim\-centred scholarship of ‘Holocaust studies’. In his 2016 *Final Solution* **\(R1\)** he integrated these two perspectives, demonstrating the hugely diverse ways in which persecution affected different communities \(not just in different countries, but within them too\), the sense of uncertainty and, at the same time, the profound sense of shock that accompanied the violence. His research encompassed, on the one hand, the dilemmas faced by some Jews, recognising that the choices they faced were usually not real choices at all, and, on the other hand, that some Jews had room for manoeuvre, which they could use on behalf of either themselves or others, or at others’ expense. 

 Stone’s research on twentieth\-century Europe is also focused on integrating perpetrator and victim\-centred accounts. His research shows that the Holocaust was by no means an ‘industrial genocide’ but a continent\-wide crime of a deeply brutal and traumatic nature. His 2015 *The Liberation of the Camps* **\(R3\)** provided a deeply researched account of survivors' and liberators’ experiences of liberation from Nazi death camps and the long, difficult years that followed. Drawing on archival sources and eyewitness testimonies, his research revealed the complex challenges liberated victims faced and the daunting tasks their liberators undertook to help them reclaim their shattered lives, Stone’s research focused on the survivors and their numerous postwar problems as well as the complex responses of the Allied troops. This research has fed directly into the Imperial War Museum London’s revamped Holocaust galleries, due to open in 2021. 

 Stone’s 2016\-19 Leverhulme\-funded project on the International Tracing Service built on this expertise in Holocaust and European history **\(R2\)**, resulting in a new social history of the Holocaust that is sensitive to place and to the victims’ experiences **\(G1\)**. The main focus of this research is on the ways in which the vast archival holdings of the International Tracing Service \(over 30 million documents\) can help us reimagine the Holocaust through the effects it had on individuals and communities. It shows, for example, the huge extent to which the Nazis and their allies created a network of concentration camps **\(R4\)** across Europe, the vast use of slave labour provided by the camp inmates, and the distressing nature of the last stages of the war, when camp inmates were forced on ‘death marches’ and were then ‘liberated’ in unpredictable and varied ways. It also highlights the International Tracing Service’s work after the war, in tracing the steps of and mapping these forced marches, in drawing up cemetery maps indicating where camp inmates were killed on their marches, in exhuming bodies in the \(usually vain\) hope of identifying the dead, and in working to reunite survivors, especially children, with relatives, and in repatriating or resettling them after their physical recovery and stay in displaced persons camps. Stone’s insights into the experiences of the victims, their varied trajectories through the vast Nazi camp universe and the huge scale of local collaboration across Nazi\-occupied Europe have helped to shape the Imperial War Museum’s redesigned Holocaust Galleries, underpinned exhibitions at the Wiener Holocaust Library \(including travelling exhibitions around the UK\) and informed the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust’s texts for its annual commemorative ceremonies.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Before the impact achieved by the Holocaust Research Institute, public understanding of the Holocaust was very much rooted in the idea of ‘factory\-line genocide’, especially at Auschwitz. Cesarani’s emphasis on the connections between the military situation in World War II and the changing Nazi policies towards the murder of the Jews, has been widely used to informed public understanding of the Holocaust. Stone’s work too shows how the killing of Jews took many forms and how ‘messy’ the whole process was. This research has influenced the Imperial War Museums, the Wiener Holocaust Library, and the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust whose work has all shifted to recognise this more complex image of the Holocaust. 

 **Informing Museums and Holocaust Commemoration** 

 Cesarani was a founding trustee of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust \(HMDT\) from 2013 and its historical consultant. In this role he advised ‘on the historical content of specific resources, ensuring that HMDT continued to provide authoritative, knowledgeable expert guidance and produce accurate, reliable material’ **\(S1\)**. As a member of the Holocaust Commission’s 2014 Expert Group on Education set up by Prime Minister David Cameron, he contributed directly to the Commission’s 2015 report, ‘Britain’s Promise to Remember: The Prime Minister’s Holocaust Commission Report’ **\(S2\)**. The report followed Cesarani’s recommendations that: 

-  a striking and prominent new National Memorial should be built in central London. 

-  a world\-class Learning Centre should sit alongside the memorial. 

-  an endowment fund should be set up to secure the long\-term future of Holocaust education. 

-  an urgent programme should be established to record the testimonies of British Holocaust survivors and liberators. 

 All four of the recommendations are being implemented. The UK Holocaust Memorial received the backing of Prime Minister Theresa May in 2015, and it will be located in Victoria Tower Gardens next to the Houses of Parliament. The memorial’s design and content at an advanced stage of planning in 2020, when Lord Eric Pickles, the co\-chair of the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation Advisory Board, said: ‘The nation needs this Memorial. It will stand next to Parliament as a permanent reminder that legislators always have a choice, either to protect or oppress human rights’ **\(S3\)**. Highlighting the personal implications of Cesarani’s work, Holocaust survivor Mala Tribich MBE said: ‘ *As the Holocaust recedes into history and we survivors become less able to share our testimonies this memorial and learning centre will be a lasting legacy so that future generations will understand why it is important for people to remember the Holocaust, to learn from the past and stand up against injustice*’ **\(S3\)**. 

 Cesarani’s research also fed directly into policy decisions made by the Imperial War Museums about how to educate its visitors on the Holocaust. His 2016 study *Final Solution* **\(R1\)**, ‘ *profoundly informed the core approach to the galleries*’ **\(S4\)**. Cesarani had been involved in the original design – visited by over 8,000,000 people – and the project director recalls that ‘ *his \[Cesarani’s\] interventions during this process were critical to the eventual approval that the exhibition gained in academic circles and more widely*’ **\(S1\)**. He would also have been involved in the redesign had he not died in October 2015. Cesarani’s legacy and his major contribution to public understanding of the Holocaust were recognised in a book dedicated to his research. Neil Gregor, reviewing *Final Solution* in the *Times Higher* said: ‘ *This book may remind us of who and what we have lost, but as a legacy to a field it is hard to imagine a finer piece of work*’ **\(S5\)**. Visitors to the new IWM Holocaust Galleries will now learn that the Holocaust was not as systematic a process as they thought. 

 Stone chaired the Imperial War Museums’ Academic Advisory Board for the redesigned Holocaust Galleries \(opening 2021\); the Content Leader for the new Holocaust Galleries at the Imperial War Museum writes: ‘ *you have made a critical contribution to the formation of the narrative that forms the basis of the project to create new galleries, and have been a vital presence in ensuring that the content of these is consistently aligned with – and informed by – the latest historiographical thinking on the subject*’ **\(S4\)**. He also played an advisory role for the, both on its Experts’ Reference Group and its Holocaust Memorial Day 2020 Advisory Group. The Chief Executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust \(HMDT\) writes: Stone ‘ *enables Holocaust education and academia to be brought to wide audiences, including lay audiences and younger audiences*’, and that he ‘ *actively and significantly assists HMDT to fulfil its central purpose of making a difference to what people know, feel and do, as a result of taking part in an event or activity for Holocaust Memorial Day*’ **\(S6\)**. 

 Stone’s current research project on the International Tracing Service also led to him advising on \(and speaking at the launch of\) a 2016 Wiener Holocaust Library exhibition entitled *A Bitter Road: Britain and the Refugee Crisis of the 1930s and 1940s*. This exhibition received over 1,200 visitors and Stone’s talk was published by the newly\-opened Migration Museum and on the website refugeehistory.org. Stone spoke at a key public event connected to another Wiener Holocaust Library exhibition, *Science and Suffering: Victims and Perpetrators of Nazi Human Experimentation*, in June 2017, which received 880 visitors, as well as numerous other events at the Wiener Holocaust Library. These exhibitions and talks changed public understanding by showing how current\-day issues are connected to the past and by helping the public understand the complex trajectories experienced by victims of the Holocaust. 

 The first fruits of Stone’s research on the International Tracing Service were visible in the exhibition and lecture series co\-curated by Stone with Dr Christine Schmidt at the Wiener Holocaust Library *Fate Unknown* \(February\-May 2018\), which was seen by 1,995 visitors \(the largest number of visitors to a Wiener Holocaust Library exhibition to that date\) and demonstrably changed people’s understanding of the impact of the Holocaust on the survivors, their families, and the shape of postwar Europe. One visitor described it as ‘ *a magnificent “tour de force*” *and a fitting memory to those who were mostly forgotten*’. And another wrote, in a common response: ‘ *I cannot recall being so moved and affected by one room. The combination of the powerful complexities with the personal story is incredible*.’ The exhibition, which is currently travelling to other parts of the UK, was accompanied by well\-attended lectures, film screenings and dramatic reading of a 1950 BBC radio play, reaching over 2,000 people **\(S8\)**. Ben Barkow, the former director of the Wiener Holocaust Library, writes that Stone ‘ *has played a very great role in helping the Library to maintain its high scholarly standards and reputation*’ and concludes: ‘ *Anyone who benefits from the existence of the Wiener Library owes a debt to Prof. Stone, who has shown exceptional care and generosity to this institution and has become an invaluable partner to us*’ **\(S7\)**. 

 **Changing Public Understanding through the Media and Education** 

 Both Cesarani and Stone contributed to TV programmes and other media debates which brought the history of the Holocaust to the attention of a wider public. Cesarani’s research informed *Annihilation*, which aired on Yesterday in 2015 \(an eight\-part documentary about the destruction of Europe's Jews, also released in Germany, France, Belgium and Finland\). An excerpt from the series on YouTube has been watched 2,569 times. Cesarani was a frequent contributor to BBC Newsnight \(viewing figures approximately 600,000\), e.g. on 16 February 2015 when he discussed the sensitive topic ‘Is it time for Jews to leave Europe?’ \(20,700 online views\). A blog piece Cesarani wrote for the Holocaust Educational Trust in 2013 has been viewed 47,903 times. And the trailer for the critically acclaimed film *Night Will Fall* \(2014\), in which Cesarani was interviewed and which was broadcast around the world by major networks, has been watched online 638,311 times. These interventions have improved the general public’s appreciation of the complexities of the history of the Holocaust. 

 Stone’s contributions to TV documentaries, including *Hitler* \(Discovery Channel, 2015\); *The Big Picture* \(Al Jazeera, 2016\); *Witnesses of War* \(Discovery Channel, 2016\), *Pass Pass Għal Auschwitz* \( *Steps to Auschwitz*, Maltese TV, 2018\), and *Belsen* \(Atlantic Productions, 2019\) have also changed public perceptions of the Holocaust. He has also been interviewed for several press outlets, including a long interview in *Publicó* in 2017, Portugal’s most respected newspaper \(50,000,000 page views per month\), and Turkish, Hungarian and Italian papers and journals. His writings as a Senior Fellow of the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right are widely read \(1,793 views at least\) and syndicated to several online journals, including Fair Observer and Rantt.com, and he has also written on Holocaust denial for the *Jewish Chronicle* \(circulation 21,000 per week\). Stone’s research has changed people’s understanding because they now comprehend the development of the Holocaust more clearly. 

 Stone’s research is used to educate and inform a wide range of public audiences through lectures in the UK, the US, Italy, Germany, Romania, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, and France. In his lecture tour in Italy \(January 2018\), he spoke to over 500 people in 4 lectures to the general public and, in one case \(Carpi\), some 200 schoolchildren of sixth\-form age **\(S9\)**. Stone’s work is also disseminated to the public via educational materials such as his document collection on the Holocaust for The National Archives, a standard resource for school pupils at KS3 and KS4 as well as the general public \(accessed 58,400 times since 2017\) and the ‘Genocide in Our Eyes’ booklet \(2016\) produced by schoolchildren from 14 schools led by Andrew Lawrence of Hampton School, who says of Stone that he is ‘ *able to explain his research very clearly’ and that ‘his words became a central part of the booklet*’ **\(S10\)**. Stone was also academic advisor on a KS3 textbook written by UCL’s Centre for Holocaust Education, 30,000 initial copies of which were circulated in September 2020. Both Cesarani and Stone worked with the Imperial War Museums on providing teacher training.  Head of Content at the Holocaust Galleries reported, ‘ *In terms of reach and impact of Professor Cesarani’s and Professor Stone’s work at capacity, the museum’s current Holocaust learning programme works with 25,000 students and teachers each academic year. With the opening of the new Galleries we plan to increase capacity to 50,000 at IWM London*’ **\(S4\)**. After exposure to Cesarani’s and Stone’s research, the children understand that the Holocaust was a far more complex phenomenon than they assumed, but they are also provided with ways to navigate it. 

 The impact will be sustained by a collaboration formed in 2020 by the Holocaust Research Institute, Wiener Holocaust Library the University of Huddersfield and the Holocaust Survivors Friendship Association \(Leeds\), which brings the expertise of the four institutions together to promote Holocaust scholarship among as wide a public audience as possible, especially amongst deprived communities in the north of England. 

 These resources will transform public understanding of, and schools’ teaching of the Holocaust by demonstrating that the Holocaust was a continent\-wide phenomenon which played out differently in different places, albeit under overall German control, and by showing that the path to the ‘final solution’, although not straightforward, depended on an antisemitic consensus shared by the wide circle of German perpetrators and their allies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The ITER tokomak is designed to demonstrate the large\-scale feasibility of fusion energy generation. It depends critically on superconducting materials to carry the large currents which enable magnetic confinement of the plasma. New metrology techniques developed in Durham are able to characterise the properties of the superconducting strand *under operational conditions,* enabling selection for build of only those which meet the stringent requirements. 

 ITER maps directly onto the United Kingdom’s legal commitment to zero net carbon emissions by 2050. The United States Department of Energy concluded that ITER is the most important large\-scale project in the world of the next 20 years. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Hampshire and his group have spent the last two decades in Durham researching new instrumentation and measurement protocols to study the current carrying capacity of superconductors. The critical current density, Jc, of a superconductor, is the maximum current density for lossless conduction. This is completely determined by flux pinning at grain boundaries under realistic operating conditions, as this prevents the heating associated with flux motion. In a detailed series of experimental, theoretical, and computational works, Professor Hampshire demonstrated the relationship between Jc and flux flow at grain boundaries in technologically important polycrystalline superconducting materials. Flux pinning becomes much less effective at high magnetic fields and high strains, giving a critical current density which is less than 1% of the theoretical Cooper pair maximum \[R1\-6\]. 

 From 2000, Hampshire and researchers in Durham designed, built and commissioned the first research instruments capable of measuring the critical current as a function of magnetic field, temperature and strain, *Jc\(B,T,ε\),* in long\-length superconducting strands. These could perform measurements with nV sensitivity with independent control of all the parameters i.e. high magnetic fields, up to 15T \(Durham\) and 28T \(Grenoble\), at cryogenic temperatures from 1.8\-14K, and high currents, up to 2KA and under uniaxial strains from \-1% to \+0.5% \[R1\]. This research led to the current impact case study because the development of this instrument critically enables the study of Jc under the operational conditions expected for the superconducting materials for use in ITER. The novelty and accuracy of the data, together with the associated understanding of flux pinning and low temperature superconductor behaviour \(Ginzburg\-Landau theory\) led to the development of the ‘ *Durham Scaling Law*’, replacing the former standard ‘ *Summers’ scaling law’*, previously used by the fusion energy community. This established Durham as a world\-leading research centre for novel, accurate measurements of *Jc\(B,T,ε\)* \[R2–4\] and for developing an understanding of flux pinning in high field superconductors. This was further recognised in 2005 in research building on the *Jc\(B,T,ε\)* expertise to measure both \(isotropic\) low temperature superconductors and \(anisotropic\) high temperature superconductors \[R4, R5\], funded by a GBP1,600,000 EPSRC grant. 

 Superconducting magnets manufactured from the isotropic low temperature superconductors Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn and NbTi provide the enabling materials technology for the current generation of magnetically confined fusion energy tokamaks. The Hampshire Group has been closely associated with European fusion energy projects and most recently the international ITER project at the CEA Cadarache Centre in Provence. In 2011, Raine and Hampshire set up and managed the European Reference Laboratory \(ERL\) funded by ITER for approximately EUR2,000,000. This has completed several thousand *Jc\(B,T,ε\)* measurements and other cryogenic and physical property measurements of the European superconducting strands needed for the ITER magnets using the facilities and research expertise in the Group. This expertise was further recognised between 2012 and 2018 as the group was part of the original GBP2,400,000 EPSRC Fusion Doctoral Training Network \(EP/K504178/1\) and in 2020, its renewal. Prof. Hampshire also has expertise in magnet design and has recently been granted two patents \(GB2562385, GB2558685\) concerning a novel design for a superconducting magnet for producing part of the toroidal field \(TF\) which forms the basis of new designs of magnets that consider the topology of superconducting magnets in fusion tokamaks \[e.g. R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Superconducting magnets are an essential enabling technology for magnetically confined fusion energy tokamaks. Conventional electromagnets made of copper or aluminium would either melt or be prohibitively expensive to run, both in terms of cost and energy. Such economic realities also underpin the use of superconducting strands \(or wires/cables\) for high\-field magnets used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance techniques \(the basis for Magnetic Resonance Imagers in the health sector\), and in high\-energy particle accelerators, such as at CERN. 

 

 Fig. 1: Toroidal field magnets, with person to scale 

Nuclear fusion potentially provides a clean, zero carbon and effectively limitless route to the solution of the world’s energy needs. However, the technical challenges to control a plasma of sufficiently high energy to sustain a net energy output are immense. The main focus for the worldwide effort in nuclear fusion is currently on magnetic confinement and in particular on the ITER tokamak being built in Southern France. The ITER project is a collaboration between 35 nations \(including China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States\). It will be the world's largest toroidal magnetic fusion device and aims to demonstrate the feasibility of commercial fusion energy. 

 

 Fig. 2: Structure of the superconducting strands. 

The scale of ITER is immense. 10,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, the largest and most integrated superconducting system ever built, with a combined stored magnetic energy of 51 Gigajoules, will produce the magnetic fields that will initiate, confine, shape and control the 10<sup>8</sup>K ITER plasma. There are 18 D\-shaped coils of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn producing a toroidal field **\[E1\]** \(Fig 1\) **,** 10 of which are to be built in Europe, with the other 8 \(\+1 spare\) manufactured in Japan. These, together with the poloidal field \(PF\) coils of NbTi, amount to one third of the estimated USD22billion cost of the tokamak. 

 The magnet technology is based on internally cooled “ *cable\-in\-conduit conductors*”, in which bundled superconducting strands, mixed with copper, are cabled together and contained in a structural steel jacket \(see Fig 2\). These coils will be highly stressed and the reliability of the more than 100,000km of strands used in these superconducting magnets is critical to the progression of the project and to the overall success of ITER. This in turn requires robust, reliable and detailed quality control testing of these materials under functional conditions. This is the key impact generated from the research outputs of Professor Hampshire’s group, given international reach and significance due to ITER. It built on background work by the Durham group on measurements of the superconducting strands for both European and Japanese coils from 2002 to 2011 **\[R2\]**. Durham was then asked to make the data publicly available for the entire fusion community for use in magnet design and modelling. Dr. Mitchell \(Head of ITER Magnet group\) confirms “ *Durham developed accurate techniques to accurately control temperature and strain and for the first time parameterise the full ITER operational space*” **\[E6\]**. This has impacted on the design, the quality assurance/reliability, and the construction processes for ITER. 

 These measurements provided the gold standard in the community and have led to similar facilities being developed at the US government standards laboratory, NIST, by staff trained in Durham **\[E2\]**. *Fusion for Energy* \(F4E\), the agency responsible for the development of fusion energy in Europe, established the *European Reference Laboratory* \(ERL\) at Durham University in 2011 as a contribution to the ITER project. The ERL in Durham has subsequently received more than EUR2,000,000 in funding from F4E between 2011 and 2018 to provide thousands of characterisation measurements of the superconducting strands to be used in the 10 \(of 18 \+1 spare\) huge TF magnets/coils and one of the PF coils in the ITER magnet system **\[E7\]**. These measurements are critical and have ongoing impact at ITER \- if one TF coil fails, the topology of the plasma and vacuum jacket within the TF magnets means that inserting a new TF coil would cause a 2\-year delay for repairs/replacement. By January 2020, the measurements for F4E were completed. 

 This work in Durham included a formal quality assurance process for F4E. This comprises an independent verification of the strand supplier performance tests and is critical to acceptance of the superconducting strands prior to incorporation into the ITER magnet cables by the cable manufacturers. The experience in 2008 at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN **\[E3\]** shows that it takes only one magnet component failure to bring a machine of this complexity to a halt. Strands that do not pass the Durham tests are not used in the ITER tokamak. 

 Durham University’s research and collaboration with F4E secured reliable operation of the TF and PF coils, and informed decisions leading to improvements in productivity and resource\-use efficiency: 

  

1.  The quality of the superconducting composite strands is exceptionally reliant on the quality of the heat treatments used to diffuse the Sn in the Nb wire to produce the superconducting Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn. However, this can also lead to unwanted diffusion into the high purity copper within the strands. Key verification tests undertaken by the Durham ERL between March 2013 and June 2014 identified several strands where the copper impurity level violated specification, contrary to supplier’s data. This resulted in a review and round\-robin tests were initiated by F4E and conducted by Durham, Twente, CERN, and the ITER Organization, which confirmed the Durham results. From 2014 onwards this has resulted in F4E avoiding strands which would have compromised the reliable operation of the European TF coils in the ITER tokamak. Durham’s analysis allowed F4E to ensure the stability of the European TF coils resulting in what Thierry Boutboul, Senior Technical Officer, described as a ‘ *technical positive impact*’ **\[E4\]**. 




 Fig. 3: Heat treatment oven for the TF D\-shaped magnets in Fig. 1 


 2.   The brittle nature of the Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn polycrystalline compound means that the wires have to be baked in ovens the same size of the resulting coils \(see Fig 1 and 3\), on size scales which make it very difficult to ensure temperature homogeneity. The magnet coils themselves cannot be tested before assembly into ITER, so instead test samples are placed all around the coil in the oven. Durham produced, supplied and measured the critical current in hundreds of these test samples between October 2012 and May 2018. F4E said: ‘ *Thanks to Durham work and its very collaborative attitude the homogeneity of both … ovens has been confirmed, which is a technical positive impact*’ **\[E4\]**. 

 3.    In 2015, operational technical difficulties led to discrepancies in some of heat treatments, and it was not clear whether these coils would meet specifications. The Durham group simulated these and demonstrated that there was no impact on the Jc properties of the coil, which led F4E to comment that ‘ *I would like to stress the reactivity and the collaboration spirit of Durham staff which enabled F4E and ITER IO to get this confirmation and not to waste time … but to continue with the fabrication of the coil. This had a clear schedule positive impact on the project.*’ **\[E4\]**. 

 Durham’s research activities in functional metrology of superconductors continues to have a major impact on the ITER construction programme. The immediate impact is technical, but has significant political consequences. ITER commissioning has spiralled away from its initial 2016 schedule, with first plasma now expected in December 2025 and the budget is quadruple its original size **\[E5\]**, compounding political sensitivities. Thus, maintaining the speed of construction, while ensuring the reliability and stability of the magnets, so that at switch\-on plasma containment is achieved is crucial to the future political will and decision making of the collaborating countries in the decision to build fusion\-based electricity power stations.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 At the time of the centenary of the First World War \(2014\-18\), and especially during 2014 and in November 2018, there was significant public interest in the war and its literature.  The focus here is the impact of two related books by Guy Cuthbertson, *Wilfred Owen* \(Yale, February 2014\) and *Peace at Last: A Portrait of Armistice Day, 11 November 1918* \(Yale, October 2018\).  Other relevant research is also involved, especially Cuthbertson’s work on Edward Thomas.  Wilfred Owen and Edward Thomas were both killed during the war, and there has been considerable interest in their lives and work.  The research enhanced public understanding of, and interest in, issues, events and literature contributing to commemoration and challenged established opinions, both in relation to war literature and in offering a new view of the Armistice. This impact was achieved through a range of high\-profile channels with wide reach, including the following: talks, podcasts, television and radio appearances; many citations and reviews of Cuthbertson’s work in major publications; articles for prominent magazines; and involvement with drama productions. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cuthbertson’s research is focused on the period of the early twentieth century and especially the First World War.  He has had a wide impact, especially through two popular scholarly works published by Yale University Press \(which is committed to ‘publishing serious works that contribute to a global understanding of human affairs’, and its books ‘further scholarly investigation, advance interdisciplinary inquiry, stimulate public debate, educate both within and outside the classroom, and enhance cultural life’\). 

 Cuthbertson’s *Wilfred Owen* was published by Yale in 2014.  The research began in 2008.  This biographical study of Owen \(1893\-1918\) aimed to give a fresh interpretation of the man and his work, emphasising the literariness of his life, in terms of his creation of himself as a writer and the influence that other writers had upon him.  It also emphasised his child\-like nature, the importance of childhood and his relationship with his parents; and it explored the social, cultural and political contexts, not least the role that the class system played in his life and work.  *Wilfred Owen* tackles the posthumous reputation of Owen and the misreading of Owen’s work, including the popular perception of him as ‘anti\-war’, as a gay poet, as the poet of the common soldier, or as a poet offering ‘the truth’, realism or reportage.  Extensive archival research was carried out, using material that was previously unavailable to Owen scholars, such as the substantial Welland collection in Manchester. 

 Cuthbertson’s most recent book was also on the First World War, and looked at the day of the Armistice, 11 November 1918 – that day was also the day when Wilfred Owen’s parents were informed that he had died on 4 November.  *Peace at Last:* *A Portrait of Armistice Day, 11 November 1918* was published by Yale in 2018, and the research mostly began in 2014.  Using a wide range of material \(from many archives and libraries\), including newspapers, letters, diaries, memoirs, school magazines, sermons and photographs, the book provided a detailed study of a single day, which was for many people the greatest day in the history of the world.  Unlike other work about that day, Cuthbertson’s research emphasised the celebrations and joy, and the roles of religion and tradition, and aimed to focus on the popular response, the crowds and congregations, not just a few famous but unrepresentative individuals.  Like *Wilfred Owen*, the book challenged common misconceptions and misrepresentations. 

 Cuthbertson has also been working on the First World War through his extensive work on Edward Thomas \(1878\-1917\), who, like Owen, was killed at the Western Front.  He co\-edited *Branch\-Lines: Edward Thomas and Contemporary Poetry* \(2007\), is a General Editor of Thomas's prose for Oxford University Press, and he has produced two substantial scholarly editions of Thomas's prose, *Autobiographies* \(2011\) and *England and Wales* \(co\-edited, 2011\).  In 2018 he gave the British Academy's prestigious Chatterton Lecture on Poetry, on 'Edward Thomas and Simplicity' \(a public lecture, which was released as a podcast and also published in the open\-access *Journal of the British Academy* in 2019\).

 *Peace at Last* reviewed by Professor Simon Heffer in *The Literary Review* 

 ‘Guy Cuthbertson’s superbly researched and exhaustive survey of the day the Great War ended \[…\] One of the strengths of this fine book is that the reader has the sensation that he or she actually took part in what, at the time, was regarded as the greatest day in the history of the world’ 

 *Peace at Last* reviewed by Professor Nicoletta F. Gullace in *The Journal of British Studies* 

 ‘With beautiful and detailed prose, Cuthbertson creates a work of narrative history reminiscent of Barbara Tuchman and nearly impossible to put down. \[…\] In doing so, he offers some subtle but important historiographical insights.’ 

 *Wilfred Owen* reviewed by Professor John Sutherland in *The Times* 

 ‘Cuthbertson is scrupulous, thoughtful and open\-minded. His book is fired with enthusiasm for the poems and respect for the man who created them. The result is a fine biography.’ 

 *Wilfred Owen* reviewed by Dr Gary Day in *The Times Higher Education Supplement* 

 ‘\[a\] scintillating biography \[…\] breathes some life into the war poet \[…\] Scholars of Owen, and that mythical beast the common reader, will also find much to enjoy \[…\] For a long time Owen has been set in stone, his poetry ossifying into anti\-war cliché. Cuthbertson has made him live again.’

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Guy Cuthbertson’s work has enhanced awareness, understanding, participation and engagement, and it has contributed to First World War commemoration while also challenging established opinions.  The means by which the impact was made \(such as through television appearances\), is also often an indicator of the reach and significance of the impact.  During the centenary of the First World War \(2014\-18\), and particularly in 2014 and 2018, Cuthbertson’s work had a wide audience, and he contributed to commemoration events and to the public discussion of the war, its influence and its legacy.  He also offered a new view of the Armistice and of the practices of Remembrance.  He raised awareness of the literature of the First World War, offered insights into the life and work of its writers, highlighted his own extensive research, and provided new perspectives on the First World War itself, especially its conclusion. 

 **Reviews and Citations** 

 His work has been reviewed and cited widely in the press, not just in the UK and the USA, but also for instance in publications in Switzerland, Portugal, Australia, Indonesia, Spain and India.  *Wilfred Owen* has sold well \(in hardback, ebook and paperback\) and has been reviewed in dozens of newspapers, magazines and non\-academic journals across the world, including lead reviews and cover stories, and as a ‘Book of the Week’ or ‘Must Read’.  It was for instance, chosen as one of the **‘Top Ten Biographies of the Year’ by** Booklist, as a **‘Book of the Week’ \(in hardback\) and ‘Must Read’ \(in paperback\) by** The Daily Mail, and as one of the **‘Books of the Year’ by the New Zealand Book Council and among the ‘Pick of the Paperbacks’ in** The Sunday Times.  In The Sunday Times it was also the Books section cover story.  It was given extensive coverage in, for example, The Financial Times, The Australian, The Sunday Herald and The Birmingham Post.  In The Birmingham Post, Richard Edmonds stated that ‘rarely has a poet been better served than by Guy Cuthbertson’s sensitive and beautifully\-written account \[…\] Should you purchase this truly lovely and deeply humane book, I guarantee you will read and re\-read it – maybe for the rest of your life’.  The BBC website included it in its **‘Books of 2014’.  \(Please see in section 5, below, sources 1 and 2, but also 10.\) ** *Peace at Last* was reviewed widely too, for example in *The Wall Street Journal*, *The Spectator* and *The Literary Review*.  It was **‘Book of the Week’** in *The Evening Standard* and it was included in *The Daily Telegraph*’s **‘Books of the Year’** **\(see sources 3 and 4, but also 10\).  In** *The Evening Standard*, Robert Fox called it ‘outstanding’: ‘\[a\] brilliant portrayal of Britain on the day that peace broke out \[…\] He weaves a wonderful tapestry of the mood and events across the country \[…\] It is accessible history at its best’. 

 **Media Appearances** 

 Cuthbertson has made high\-profile television appearances talking about his research and raising awareness of it.  He has spoken frequently on radio \(eg. Radio Wales, Radio Merseyside, Radio London\) and talks have been released as podcasts.  He has helped to shape the media representation of the First World War.  For instance, he spoke in detail about Owen, and influenced the script and choice of locations, for a BBC programme on Owen presented by Ian McMillan, which was included in the major commemorative event, **World War One Remembered from Westminster Abbey \(BBC 2, 4 August 2014\).  He was also interviewed about Owen for a special episode of **Songs of Praise** \(BBC 1, 4 November 2014\).  \(See sources 8 and 10.\)  As a result of his research for *Peace at Last*, he played a significant part in **BBC 1’s **Remembrance Sunday: The Cenotaph, 2018 – World War One Remembered** \(11 November 2018\).  This prominent programme, covering a major national event, lasted for three and a half hours \(10am\-1.30pm\) and Cuthbertson was a studio guest through the programme \- his book was also used by the BBC for the script and research \(see sources 9 and 10\). 

####  **Public talks and other activities** 

 Cuthbertson has given dozens of high\-profile public talks \- talks at literary festivals and book signings, but also at schools, literary societies, museums and libraries.  These include, for instance, his prestigious **British Academy Chatterton Lecture on Poetry**, a public lecture which is available as a podcast \(see source 7\) and was published as an open access resource.  He contributed to a Wilfred Owen app, and to preparations and publicity for three different productions of the play *Not About Heroes* \(a play about Owen\).  Cuthbertson wrote feature articles for the *The New Statesman* and *The Tablet*, and for *BBC History Magazine* \(see sources 5 and 6\), which extended the reach of his research. 

 **Feedback** 

 Cuthbertson has received feedback in person at talks and book\-signings, and via, for instance, twitter and email; and public engagement has also taken place through blogs, online reviews and social media.  Evidence of the impact of his work can also be seen in the sales figures for his books, in data on borrowing from public libraries \(PLR data suggests that *Wilfred Owen* was borrowed nearly 5000 times\), in downloads and subscriptions, television audience figures, and in listening figures for podcasts.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Rippel’s project *No Woman’s Land* \(2015\-2018\) had an impact on public knowledge and cultural life across Europe, raising audience awareness and understanding of women’s experiences of war and migration through innovative performance practice, including a 220\-mile walk, subsequent performances, blogs and film screenings. Audiences specifically gained increased knowledge of how rape was used as a weapon in the Second World War. Through dramaturgical innovations such as the use of treadmills in performances, and engaging audience members in this performative practice, the research impacted audience understanding through kinesthetic empathy. Younger members of the public were particularly impacted on by this research. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Rippel’s research project *No Woman’s Land* \(2015\-2018\) retraced the experiences of her grandmother Lucia as a refugee mother in post\-war Europe. In 1945, as the Second World War came to an end, Lucia was expelled from her place of birth in lower Silesia \(formerly Germany\). The area was liberated by the Soviet Army. The systematic rape of German women was ordered as a retribution for atrocities and war crimes committed by Nazi Germany. After being raped, Lucia was forced to leave her home, walking for three months through the fractured post\-war landscape of northern Europe, dragging her two small children and her belongings in a cart. Rippel saw Lucia’s story is a micro\-narrative opposed to the grand narrative of the Second World War, and her research demonstrated that such micronarratives are a rarely analysed part of the history of the conflict. Rippel used this narrative to interrogate and communicate women’s experiences of war and migration more broadly through performance research. 

 In August 2015 Rippel and Rosie Garton \(Zoo Indigo theatre company\) re\-walked the 220\-mile journey from Brzeźnica, Poland, to Pulspforde, Germany, carrying their own children in flat\-pack form. During the walk, Rippel engaged with local communities, interviewed persons who had had similar experiences as refugees in the aftermath of World War II, visited the archives at the Foundation for Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation in Berlin, and spoke to Andrea Kamp, an expert on the history of Silesian refugees at the foundation. During the walk Rippel shared her findings and experiences via daily blogs and vlogs and social media and was followed by an international audience online. 

 The key aims of the project were to share research with a wider public during the research project itself \(‘as it happened’\), and to focus audiences on the levels of physical and mental exhaustion that must have been felt by Lucia and other women. Rippel applied a phenomenological methodology in re\-walking her Grandmother’s journey as a refugee mother, to gain an embodied knowledge of lived experiences and or walking as endurance. Through the experience of the walk and the staging of the exhausted maternal body in subsequent performances \(by for example utilising treadmills on stage\), the performers developed a dramaturgy of authenticity in the performance of migration, and their audiences experienced ‘kinesthetic empathy’ for migrants and refugees through witnessing endurance. 

 *No Woman’s Land* was developed into an 18\-minute documentary film which was screened in the UK and at international festivals, for example, at the Walking Women event 2016 at Somerset House \(London\), and a full\-length theatre performance which toured to small and mid\-scale arts centres nationally in the UK, such as Attenborough Arts Centre, Leicester, Camden’s People Theatre \(A Nation’s Theatre Festival\), London, Mansfield Create Theatre, Derby Theatre and Lincoln Drill Hall.

-  Performances, national and international \- No Woman’s Land was performed in the following venues: Chulalongkorn University Theatre, Thailand 9 February 2016 \(audience of 70\); Attenborough Arts Centre, Leicester, 23 April 2016 \(audience of 70\); Camden’s People Theatre, A Nation’s Theatre Festival, London, 10 & 11 May 2016 \(audience of 100\); Mansfield Create Theatre, College Students, 20 May 2016 \(audience of 33\); Derby Theatre, 12 November 2016 \(audience of 80\); Attenborough Arts Centre, Leicester, 25 November 2016 \(audience of 70\); Lincoln Drill Hall, 9 Feb 2017 \(audience of 42\); Drama Studio, University of Worcester, 27 February 2017 \(audience of 98\); Arena Theatre Wolverhampton, 9 June 2017 \(audience of 47\); Lakeside Arts Centre, Nottingham, 2 March 2018 \(audience of 120\). 

-  Film Screenings \- The No Woman’s Land film was screened as follows: Artist as Mother as Artist exhibition, Lace Market Gallery, Nottingham, 22 April – 19 May 2016; Neat Festival, Nottingham Playhouse, 25 and 28 May 2016; Departure Lounge Festival, Derby Theatre, 22 July 2016; Walking Women Event, Somerset House, Screening Room, 17 July 2016; New Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich, Pulse Festival, 3 June 2017. 

-  Public engagement with the project blog which had 522 visitors and 1,595 views during the walk\), and during screenings of the film. 

-  Social media \- Zoo Indigo’s Facebook page currently has 556 followers, and their Twitter account has 892 followers. 

 First, during the 220\-mile walk from Brzeźnica, Poland, to Pulspforde, Germany, the performers engaged with local communities. These communities had their appreciation and understanding of women’s experiences of war and migration enriched by engaging with the itinerant performers. This is evidenced through the documentary film \(Reference 2\). 

 Second, through innovative dramaturgical practice demonstrated in subsequent performances 

 based on the walk, audiences gained increased knowledge and understanding of not only the experience of specific women migrants but also of the systematic use of rape as a weapon during the Second World War. As Michaela Butter MBE \(Director, Attenborough Arts Centre\) \(Source A\) puts it, ‘Talking to audience members, and reading subsequent Tweets and reviews, it was clear that the piece impacted on our audiences thinking and awareness, clearly challenging preconceived ideas around gender and political bias.’ Furthermore, the poet Roosa Herranen \(Source B\) remarks: ‘The show made me think again about the plight of refugees in the crisis in Europe at the time, and the ideological debates around Brexit.’ 

 Third, to enable a sense of embodiment and kinesthetic empathy in the performances, the performers walked on treadmills, and audience members, through witnessing the exhaustion of these performers, experienced kinesthetic empathy. This dramaturgical methodology allowed audience members to reflect on and develop a nuanced understanding of the experience of enforced migration. Prof Dr Meyer\-Dinkgräfe \(Source C\) explains that ‘Spectators commented on how they empathised with the performers when they were on the treadmill, and even more so with the presumably less well\-trained spectators who volunteered to be on the treadmills for a while.’ Furthermore, through the physical act of walking, audience members who walked on the treadmills themselves during these performances developed a physical, embodied understanding of the endurance of migrant mothers, as well as the experience Rippel had had of retracing Lucia’s footsteps. Ruby Glaskin \(Creative Producer for In Good Company\) \(Source D\) remarks: ‘To see two women physically walk throughout the performance had a profound impact on me as an audience member which could not have been grasped through text or audio alone.’ This dramaturgical strategy not only produced an authentic, embodied engagement with historical events, but also facilitated research impact through the development of new knowledge and understanding. Thus, kinesthetic empathy provided the ontological pathway to impact on new historical and political knowledge. Furthermore, audience members were also impacted upon by being given the enriching opportunity to experience and engage with performance\-making practice themselves. 

 Fourth, viewers of the 18\-minute documentary film gained further awareness, knowledge and understanding of the key issues raised by the research project articulated above \(see Source E\). The research blog was followed worldwide, and comments on the blog and emails and social media messages sent to Rippel demonstrated the new insights online audiences gained about regarding historical knowledge focused on women’s experience of war and migration.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Through collaborations with non\-profit, grassroots and charitable organisations, Dr Bush’s research has deepened historical understanding of the need for Africa\-centred models of literary production. The impacts of her research span Senegal, Cameroon, Uganda, France and the UK; transforming literary industries in Africa and empowering those working in the sector. Her research has led to the development of sustainable literary infrastructures, new forms of literary production and the establishment of literary networks supporting young and emerging writers. The beneficiaries include publishers, writers, literary translators, artists, archivists, and museum curators. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Dr Bush \(promoted to Senior Lecturer in French and Comparative Literature in 2018\) has diagnosed and mapped the historically uneven relationship between African literary producers and global literary infrastructure, where dominant forms of knowledge production remain weighted towards what can be termed the ‘global North’ or ‘Minority World’. She has investigated how African print cultures and their varied aesthetics have operated in the twentieth and early twenty\-first centuries against the backdrop of formal processes of decolonisation, postcolonial language politics, and the institutional structures of a colonially inflected ‘Republic of Letters’. Bush’s work has revealed a wealth of untapped source material. It has emphasised the role of print \(on paper and on screen\) as a form of social, cultural and political activism, and identified the need to support more autonomous, local and continent\-based enterprises, in turn making African literary enterprises more visible and sustainable. 

#  Decolonisation and literary institutions in France and francophone Africa 

 Bush’s initial award\-winning monograph in this area focused on inequalities in the global literary marketplace and the production of a francophone literary canon. Combining archival research and analysis of African literature in post\-war France, she revealed both: the destabilising impact of decolonisation on legitimate notions of language, authorship and literary value; how the variegated African literary presence actively shaped the metropolitan publishing scene during this period of transition **\[3.1\]**. 

#  Historicising print activism in the UK and Senegal 

 Using new archival material and oral histories of London\-based ‘print activists’, Bush wrote the history of the UK’s first radical Black bookshop and publishing house, New Beacon Books \(part of the Heritage Lottery Fund ‘Dream to Change the World’ project at the George Padmore Institute, London\). The research highlighted the centrality of concepts of autonomy to the founders’ ethos, and the varied modes of social justice activism that operated within the racialised socio\-political context of 1960s Britain and in the globally networked frameworks of Third\-Worldist thought **\[3.2\]**. In 2016, Bush then collaborated with partners in the UK, France, and Senegal on an AHRC\-funded project to digitise and restore the complete archive of one of the earliest francophone African women’s magazines, *Awa: la revue de la femme noire*. As PI, Bush identified *Awa* as a long over\-looked source for tracing the polemical debates on the \(un\)translatability of feminist thought between the global North and global South, post\-independence nationalism, and representations of the female body in African and diasporic cultural production **\[3.5\]**. The project signalled the crucial relationship between independent print activism and socio\-political movements on the African continent over the past seventy years. It also encouraged public and scholarly understanding of less\-canonical elements of francophone African women’s print culture and local print innovation post\-1950. 

####  Readership and literary translation in west Africa 

 Bush has contributed significantly to extant work on popular print cultures and readership in Africa \(previously mostly studied in the continent’s anglophone regions\), highlighting the highly gendered social worlds of everyday literacies, the emergence of new genres, and the kinds of textual and visual authority wielded by ‘popular’ print and its readers **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. Bush’s current research emphasis on literary translation imperatives in the African literary commons \(from 1950s to present day\) has built on her archival expertise, multilingualism, and an extensive network of practical activities taking place since 2016. Bush has employed innovative methodologies in this area, using ethnographic modes of research, focus groups, workshops, and interviews, for a book now under contract with CUP, in addition to a deeper reflection on decolonial epistemology and ‘indiscipline’ within the Humanities.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Dr Bush’s research has contributed decisively to transforming the African literary landscape. It has led to social, cultural and economic impacts for literary activists, archivists, curators and museums, as well as the wider public, across francophone Africa and the African diaspora. 

#  Established new, multilingual, literary networks across multiple African countries 

 Bush’s research has influenced a cultural shift on the African continent, from a primarily economic model of literary entrepreneurship, to a politically motivated notion of literary activism. As the founder of Writivism Festival and the Centre for African Cultural Excellence \(CACE\) \(Uganda\) notes ‘It was while in South Africa \[during the \#RhodesMustFall protests\] that I read Ruth Bush's work on New Beacon Books **\[3.2\]**, and given closer interactions with Ntone Edjabe at Chimurenga \[influential Pan\-African cultural collective\], it became clearer to me that the work the countless literary initiatives are doing is more political than professional. To borrow Fanon's words, they are creating new humans’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 As part of this shift in thinking, Bush, Prof Krishnan \(Bristol\), and Dr Wallis \(Exeter\) were invited to develop and facilitate the annual Arts Managers and Literary Activists \(AMLA\) workshops \(2016\-2018\), which brought together 60 literary activists from over 15 countries across the continent, in partnership with Writivism and CACE. The workshops provided access to inspiring examples of literary activism in Africa, and have led to a more formalised and autonomous AMLA network \(52 individual/organisations are now members\). They were followed by mentorship by established African literary activists of five new literary initiatives across East, West and Southern Africa. These include: Abidjan Lit literary collective \(Côte d’Ivoire\) which has since held seven live literature events \(audience of c.100\) and set up \(March 2020\) the 1949 Library, Côte d’Ivoire’s first reading room for African women’s writing \- they maintain an active social media presence \(3,600 Facebook followers on 23 Oct 2020\) and website, through which they offer translation and editing services, literary tours, and reading events for children and young adults; and Mawazo Africa Writing Institute \(Uganda\) which has held 3 writing workshops for 18 authors, leading to two novels currently in press with Mawazo\-Huza Press series **\[5.2\]**. 

 In 2018, Bush commissioned and managed the production and distribution of a substantial feasibility study conducted by Dr Georgina Collins. Based on interviews with over 60 translators, publishers, academics, and writers, the bilingual report has attracted widespread interest \(1,172 downloads in English; 607 downloads in French; 150 physical copies distributed to study participants\), including from many literary professionals based in other countries not involved directly in the study – Ghana, Nigeria, Benin, Madagascar, South Africa, France and the US. Working with Bakwa Media \(Cameroon – participants in the AMLA network\) and Abidjan Lit in her research on literary translation, Bush co\-developed and delivered a creative writing and literary translation workshop which took place in Yaoundé in 2019 with 24 participants. The latter was the first of its kind on the African continent and drew directly on findings and demand established by the feasibility study. It resulted in the publication of Bakwa Books Anthology, *Your Feet Will Lead You Where Your Heart Is*/ *Le crépuscule des âmes sœurs* \(2020; launch delayed due to Covid\-19\). It has led to economic impact: Bakwa Media now have contracts with Parisian literary agent Pierre Astier to publish a translation of Hemley Boum’s *Les jours viennent et passent* by one of the participants in the Bakwa workshop; and one participant in the Bakwa creative writing workshop has signed to the British literary agency, Laxfield Literary Associates **\[5.3\]**. 

#  Inspired new forms of curatorial practice and contributed to cultural heritage preservation and interpretation in the UK and Senegal 

 Bush’s research on Black British publishing **\[3.2\]** has brought economic, educational and cultural benefits for New Beacon Books \(NBB\) and the George Padmore Institute \(GPI – a key archival hub for Black British history and cultural activism\). During this REF period: 

-  Her research informed a successful exhibition at Islington Museum \(May\-Aug 2015\), attended by over 5,000 people, giving visibility to NBB’s political and cultural role; 

-  Bush convened a book club \(four editions in 2014, total attendance c. 100\), which brought new people, including local schoolteachers, to NBB and the GPI; 

-  Her research provided a stepping\-stone for both organisations to consider their future sustainability, which led to three successful grants from HLF, Arts Council England, and Barry Amiel and Norman Melburn Trust \(totaling GBP105,228 between 2016\-2020\). The funding helped GPI host 7 events and appoint a ‘poet\-in\-residence’, Jay Bernard, whose poetry was published alongside Dr Bush’s essay, and subsequently in the collection *Surge*, which won the 2018 Ted Hughes Prize **\[5.4\]**. 

 Through the AWA project **\[3.5\]**, international audiences and staff and visitors at the *Musée de la Femme Henriette Bathily* \(MUFEM\) and *Institut Fondamental d’Afrique Noire\-Cheikh Anta Diop* \(IFAN\-Ch. A. Diop\), in Dakar, Senegal have gained new understanding of Senegalese print heritage and its associated social and political role. In 2016, Bush worked with these established, but under\-resourced, institutions on a new multimedia exhibition and website archive of AWA – one of the earliest African women’s magazines. The AWA website presents the ‘scattered archive’ as a digitised magazine. It has had 4,464 users \(as of 27 Oct 2020\), 26 percent of whom are based on the African continent, with most African users based in Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire and Congo\-Kinshasa **\[5.5\]**. 

 The exhibition ran at MUFEM in Dakar from November 2017 – April 2018, attracting c. 3,000 paying visitors, before moving on. It was reproduced in Montpellier \(March\-April 2018; c. 1,000 visitors – a freely accessible event in the university library corridors, launched as part of the Semaine de l’Afrophonie\) and Bordeaux \(May\-July 2019; c. 1,000 visitors, also hosted without entry charge in the university library, as part of the Afrophonie week\); a planned transition to Marseille \(June\-July 2020\) was postponed due to Covid\-19. The exhibition heightened awareness among cross\-generational international audiences of AWA as a pioneering publishing initiative in a formative period of history for Senegalese women. One visitor commented, ‘This exhibition plunged me back into a mirror, a world, a familiar and distant dimension \[…\] a period anchored within me’. Another visitor \(based in Guinea\-Conakry\), and President of the Fondation Solidarité Féminine de Guinée, wrote of her ‘joy in discovering through this magazine the path forged by these Black women. These spaces which give women the opportunity to express themselves. Thank you again for this beautiful initiative.’ The exhibition received national and international press coverage, including front page of the national Senegalese daily paper, *Le Soleil*, a Radio France Internationale programme \(broadcast in English\), and TV5 Monde news segment **\[5.6\]**. 

 For staff at MUFEM and the original founders of the magazine, the exhibition valorised and raised MUFEM’s international profile, bringing c. 3,000 visitors and raising revenue \(c. GBP3,500\) through entry fees and sales of related items. There was a wide range of enthusiastic comments on the ‘commentary wall’, several school groups, and a well\-attended \(300\+\) launch event. The exhibition was included in the official programme of the *Ateliers de la Pensée* \(a major annual African/Diaspora intellectual and artistic gathering, organised by Achille Mbembe and Felwine Sarr\). Staff at the MUFEM spoke enthusiastically of the project during our evaluation meeting in April 2019 \(‘Awa was a hit\!’ commented one gallery attendant\). MUFEM were inspired to keep the ‘commentary wall’ for subsequent exhibitions, enabling them to continue capturing audience responses and showing a long\-term commitment to changing their practices **\[5.6\]**. 

 Staff at IFAN\-Ch. A Diop \(who undertook the digitisation\) have benefitted from involvement as an integral part of the project. Training was provided, building capacity and enthusiasm in a chronically under\-resourced institution where there is little opportunity for continuing professional development. The local and international success of the project’s digital element and the exhibition has encouraged the team at IFAN\-Ch. A Diop to continue with independent work on this material and new digitisation initiatives. They contributed to an International Women’s Day event in March 2018 by producing their own video montage of the magazine to screen at events. They have secured further funding via recently awarded grants in France: IUF \(EUR75,000\) and Erasmus \(EUR34,480\) **\[5.7\]**. 

#  Inspired new artworks 

 The AWA project has generated broader interest in the material and in preserving heritage digitally, leading to new understandings of the representation of African women in the public sphere. American artist, Fahamu Pecou, decided to use an AWA cover as the basis for a new artwork, “Jigéén Bu Bé Fenkna \(Dawn of Woman\)”, exhibited in New York in summer 2018. Multiple requests were received via the digital portal to use AWA images for projects \(forthcoming Editions Gallimard book on Women and Literature; Dakar\-based tailor, Njit Couture, found design inspiration in the magazine’s photos; the Instagram “Africa Style Archive” featured 2 images, with 341 likes \(23 Oct 2020\); *SWAG Something We Africans Got* African art magazine featured a 13\-page illustrated spread\), alongside enquiries from elderly people involved in the original project, or inspired by its premise \(e.g. Guinean Women’s organisation; daughter of original printer of AWA magazine, Awa Hélène Diop\) **\[5.8\].** 

#  Influencing policy on international collaborations 

 Bush’s extensive experience in research collaborations has contributed to ensuring long\-term productive collaborations with colleagues based on the African continent, especially in historically francophone regions \(she was awarded an ERC Starting Grant worth EUR1.5 million in September 2020\). She contributed to the APPG coalition’s \(Africa; Diaspora, Development and Migration; Malawi\) report on UK visa refusals for African visitors \(launched July 2019\) by providing written evidence for the APPG meeting and inquiry convened by Chi Onwurah MP in 2019 **\[5.9\]**. The evidence provided by Bush highlighted that African visitors to the UK \(2016\-2018\) were twice as likely to be refused a visa, which subsequently prompted a parliamentary debate around use of algorithms to process visa applications \(Hansard, 19 June 2019, vol. 662\). Bush has personally pursued four instances where a visa has been refused or delayed for a project partner, requesting evidence, contacting the Royal African Society, Ambassadors in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, and subject associations \(African Studies Association UK\). In two instances this enabled a visa decision to be overturned. This work has become a vital element of the research process for Africanist scholars based in the UK in the current political climate.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This impact is based upon the creation of a new statistical methodology that deepens and textures our ability to harvest information from a regression analysis. The GAMLSS methodology allows the modelling of a response variable using any theoretical distribution including highly skewed or/and kurtotic distributions and the modelling of all the parameters of the distribution. 

  

 The main beneficiaries are practitioners dealing with highly skewed and kurtotic data. Such data sets are very common in environmental and financial communities. This case study demonstrates that GAMLSS models were used in several important instances leading to better understanding and changes in policies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape \(GAMLSS\) were introduced by Stasinopoulos and Rigby in 2005, in a Royal Statistical Society read paper \(with discussion\), \[R1\]. 

  

 Prior to the development of GAMLSS methodology, response variables in a regression framework were often modelled based on the assumption of the exponential family of distributions. For continuous response variables, typically, this would be the normal, the gamma or the inverse Gaussian distribution. For discrete data this would be the Poisson or the binomial distribution. However, many response variables are either heavy tailed or/and highly skewed.  For example, high frequency data in econometric or finance, river flows, web traffic data and text classification data. In GAMLSS, the distribution of the response variable can be continuous, discrete or mixed. A mixed distribution is a continuous distribution with discrete parts such as, for example, a zero inflated gamma distribution. GAMLSS also allows all the parameters of the distribution to be modelled as linear or non\-linear smooth functions of the exploratory variables. Those parameters are often location, scale and shape parameters. Since all parameters are modelled, the distribution of the response variable can vary in shape according to explanatory variables. This results in more realistic models in which both rare events as well as the centre of the distribution can be modelled, accurately. This leads to better understanding of how such incidences occurred and and therefore can be used to inform more effective policies which help to mitigate risks. 

 GAMLSS solves problems inherited from the stricter assumptions of the popular GLM and the GAM regression models: i\) heterogeneity in variance, ii\) positive or negative skewness, iii\) \`platy' or \`lepto' kurtosis, iv\) over or under dispersion, v\) excess or shortage of zeros and vi\) variance\-mean relationships. Case \(iii\) above is closely related to the theory of ""heavy tails"", common in financial and environmental data where \`rare' events do occur more often. Cases \(iv\) to \(v\) are common to discrete response variables. The monograph \[R4\] is a testimony of the commitment of Stasinopoulos and Rigby in developing appropriate theoretical distributions to solve real problems. The monograph contains details of more than 100 distributions. It also shows how extra distributions can be generated and applied to real data examples. 

  

 London Metropolitan University is the main hub for the current and future development of GAMLSS.  All co\-authors of the GAMLSS books are visiting researchers and contributed to the work of the Statistics Operation Research and Mathematics centre of London Met.  Dr Voudouris, is chief data officer for Argus media, Dr De Bastiani is a lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil, and Professor Heller, is working at the Clinical Trials Centre of University of Sydney.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The benefits of a more realistic modelling of phenomena, by GAMLSS, leads to a better understanding of how those incidences occurred and therefore supports more effective policies which help to mitigate risk. The beneficiaries have been environmental, economic or regulatory agents, wishing to understand and prevent potentially damaging events. 

 <ins> **Financial Sector risk modelling**</ins> 

 In 2015, the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\) used GAMLSS for a stress testing exercise of the US economy \[S1\].  A key mission of the IMF is to periodically conduct assessments under the Financial Services Action Program \(FSAP\). “ *These assessments involve a considerable amount of data analysis and quantitative modelling. It is in this context that the GAMLSS work has been extremely relevant to us.*”  GAMLSS was found to be highly useful in the U.S. FSAP context, because it is “ *an extremely flexible model class that allowed* \[them\] *to: \(i\) utilize a wide variety of distributions to characterize the response variable and \(ii\) explicitly model the first four moments of these distributions as functions of exogenous conditions. As a result,* \[they found\] *the framework well suited to address the presence of tail\-risks, nonlinearities, and deviations from the normality assumption. The default probability data used in the stress testing exercise exhibited all of these characteristics, thereby motivating the choice of the GAMLSS model class for stress testing purposes.”* \[S1 p86\] 

 The GAMLSS model for the U.S. financial system suggested “ *that macroeconomic, sector credit risk, and interconnectivity influence credit risk in the United States in significant—and often nonlinear\-ways.*” \[S1 p88\] The GAMLSS results underscored *“the importance of spillovers across sectors*” and across borders. \[S1 p91\] The approach usefully complemented other risk analysis used in the 2015 U.S. FSAP. The analysis yielded specific findings, suggestions and **recommendations for improvement** including conducting “ *regular, comprehensive stress tests for all major financial sub\-sectors that capture the impact of macro\-financial factors, spillover and feedback effects between institutions and interactions between solvency and liquidity*” and “ *more intensive monitoring of systemic financial sector risks, including the use of market\-based solvency and shortfall measures.”* \[S1 p10\]. 

 Speaking of his “ *deep appreciation for the world class research by Professors Dimitrios Stasinopoulos and Robert Rigby, in developing*” GAMLSS, the Division Chief at the IMF observed that the “ *work has yielded an important positive contribution to our activities at the International Monetary Fund*,” noting that having worked at the IMF since 2000 and “ *with many models and analytical tools, but the GAMLSS truly stands thanks to its combination of innovativeness, analytical rigor, and applicability.”*\[S2\] In the context of the stress testing exercise of the US economy, he reports that the *“use of GAMLSS helped to change our understanding of the vulnerability”* of the US financial sector. 

 Summarising the contribution of GAMLSS to the IMF, the Division Chief states “ *the innovative research by Prof. Stasinopoulos and Prof. Rigby has been useful for the IMF’s work on assessing financial sector risk in the U.S. The analysis yielded specific findings and suggestions that were discussed in detail with our technical level counterparts during the FSAP.”* These informed their “ *higher level policy recommendations* \[which were\] *discussed with top policy makers at the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, other key agencies as well as with other stakeholders.”\[*S2\]. 

 The benefits of GAMLSS are demonstrated by its widespread usage by statisticians in non\-academic settings, particularly within the financial regulatory sector: 

 i\) The **European parliament** report, \[S3\], aimed to provide a quantitative assessment of the macro\-economic cost of a possible banking crisis within the Euro zone. 

 ii\) The **Bank of England**, \[S4\], to estimate the UK mortgage market vulnerabilities from load\-level data. 

 iii\) The **Standard Chartered Bank** \(SCB\), \[S5\] to “ *provide a macroeconomic balance sheet projections and corporate planning*”. The SCB employs more than 86,000 people and has a presence in 60 countries and territories in Europe and Americas, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. 

 iv\) The **Bank of America**, \(BoA\) “ *to develop credit risk models*” specifically to benchmark “ *loss given default \(LGD\) and exposure at default*” \(EAD\) \[S6\]. BoA has asset size of USD2.2 tn \(Sep 2020\), 2nd largest bank in the US, 8th largest in the world. 

 The team leader of Quantitative Modelling and Analytics at the SCB, reports that *“the GAMLSS toolbox is particularly appealing to us for its transparency, range of various smoothers, choice of distributions and ability to address the presence of tail\-risks, nonlinearities, and deviations from the normality assumptions*”. He notes that the GAMLSS *“models provide baseline view of the bank’s key product performance under various macroeconomic scenarios. This information is used by the top management to plan business development more efficiently into the future and spot new business opportunities”.* \[S5\] 

 <ins> **Environment and ecosystem**</ins> 

 Southern Water’s 2019 Draft Water Resources Management Plan describes how they developed their artificial weather generator for simulating rainfall for water resource model using GAMLSS because “ *these models allow the incorporation of the large\-scale climate indices \(NAO, SST\) and determine their relation to single rain gauge sites or gridded rainfall data”.* \[S7\] The resulting model “ *is now fully parametric and predicts rainfall for all seasons directly. This has thus removed issues relating to lack of persistence which were associated bootstrap sampling of spring\-autumnal rainfall*” in the earlier model. \[S7 p27\]. The new model not only “ *produces spatially and temporally coherent monthly rainfall time series*,” as a result of using GAMLSS, it also reproduces extreme rainfall patterns which is “ *unique to this model and has not been attempted or demonstrated elsewhere*.”\[S7 p28\] 

 Globally, seagrass meadows are one of the planet’s significant carbon absorption assets as well as being nursery habitats for fish and invertebrates, important food source for marine life and helping to stabilise and maintain the seabed. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Marine Monitoring Program has used GAMLSS to build models to monitor the health and condition of seagrass in the Great Barrier Reef. The resulting report notes that the GAMLSS models, used to “ *determine whether seagrass data collected*” could “ *predict subsequent seagrass coverage*” concluded that while “ *the high level of uncertainty associated with the reproductive effort index* \[hindered\] *the value of this indicator for assessing ecosystem health,*” the results supported “ *the assertion that species diversity and productivity are good indicators of resilience*.” \[S9\] The research statistician with CSIRO advised that it is “ *essential that the condition of seagrass is measured, monitored and reported accurately*.” Their models predicting seagrass abundance and reproductive effort \[S9\] are being used to “ *inform and refine future seagrass data collection and reporting in the Great Barrier Reef to ensure that this essential part of the ecosystem is monitored appropriately and management actions*” undertaken.\[S8\]

#  1 Summary of the impact 

 The University of Liverpool’s \(UoL\) *Marine Management Group* develops ecosystem\-based measures to safeguard the world’s seas and oceans and enable sustainable maritime development. Our research has led to change in policy and practice by \(1\) mobilising stakeholders for the governance of the Irish Sea, and \(2\) developing tools for implementing national marine legislation. Specifically \(1\): enabled the creation of **10 Marine Conservation Zones** in English waters, protecting vulnerable species; and established the **Irish Sea Maritime Forum** which works for the integrated governance of the Irish Sea. \(2\): Dutch and Irish agencies and the intergovernmental body for the Northeast Atlantic are using our approach to prioritise management needed under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, leading to **improved environmental status of national waters**; and South Africa is following our procedure for marine spatial planning in the **Eastern Cape marine area**. 
","
#  2 Underpinning research 

 The world’s seas and oceans are under pressure from climate change, pollution and growing human demands. Our research aims to improve human interaction with the sea, bringing the social and natural sciences into direct engagement with government and wider society. 

 Our research began with the interdisciplinary ESRC/NERC seminar series *New Approaches to Managing Ecosystem Services in the Marine Environment* \( **NAMESME**\), coordinated by Kidd \(09/2007\-08/2010\). This involved 5 seminars bringing together UK academics from the natural and social sciences, along with marine planning and management stakeholders. Discussion in these seminars drew out novel connections between marine planning and 100 years of terrestrial spatial planning experience \(3.1\). 

 Kidd led a follow\-on ESRC Knowledge Exchange award *Partnership Working in Support of Marine Spatial Planning in the Irish Sea* \( **MSPIrishSea**\) \(09/2010\-08/2011\). This dealt with the complex regional arrangements for new systems of marine planning, covering 6 national jurisdictions with separate agencies and marine stakeholders. Kidd subsequently led UoL input to the European Commission \(EC\) \(LIFE\) project *Celtic Seas Partnership* \( **CSP**\) \(01/2013\-04/2017\) which developed transboundary cooperation for implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Kidd also developed thinking in stakeholder engagement in marine management through academic publications \(e.g. 3.2\), stressing the need for equitable and representative participation. 

 Robinson led the EC projects \(FP7\) *Options for Delivering Ecosystem\-based Marine Management* \( **ODEMM**\) \(03/2010\-12/2013\) and \(Horizon 2020\) *Knowledge, Assessment and Management for Aquatic Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services* \( **AQUACROSS**\) \(06/2015\-11/2018\). A tool was developed to measure human pressures on regional seas, taking into account ecological risk and potential for recovery \(3.3\). This enables users to evaluate their management options for reducing environment impacts and see the potential for achieving their obligations under the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive, over policy time frames \(3.4\). 

 Jay and Kidd led three EC projects *Transboundary Planning in the European Atlantic* \( **TPEA**\) \(12/2012\-02/2015\) *Supporting Implementation of the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive in the Celtic Seas* \( **SIMCelt**\) \(12/2016\-02/2018\), and *Supporting Implementation in the Atlantic* \( **SIMAtl**\) \(07/2019–06/2021\). These stressed that ecosystem\-based marine management and planning require not just technical solutions, but also integration with legislative and policy frameworks and the close involvement of stakeholder communities \(3.5\). These projects led to recommen\-dations for linking marine spatial planning \(MSP\) to wider political structures and priorities \(3.6\).

#  4 Details of the impact 

 Coastal nations around the world face the challenge of historic misuse of their seas and the consequences of climate change on the oceans. We have worked directly with government agencies and stakeholders to develop practices to manage marine resources in a more sustainable way. These practices have been internalised by organisations which are now carrying them forward in the implementation of national and international policy. This is producing material outcomes in four marine areas: the Irish Sea, the North Sea, the Northeast Atlantic and South Africa’s seas. We have changed the way that agencies and stakeholders act, specifically under two themes. 

##  4.1    Mobilisation of Stakeholders in the Governance of the Irish Sea 

 Good marine ecosystem\-based management needs effective communication between government and stakeholders, ensuring knowledge transfer and better implementation of policy. We have brought stakeholders into the heart of governance of the Irish Sea in two areas of work. 

###  4.1.a   <ins>Stakeholder\-info</ins><ins>rmed Marine Conservation Zones</ins> 

 A programme for designating Marine Conservation Zones \(MCZs\) in English waters began in 03/2010 to protect habitats and species that are important, rare or under threat \(under Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009\). Regional stakeholder groups were tasked with proposing MCZs. 

 Kidd was brought in as independent chair of the Irish Sea Conservation Zones board \(03/2010\-04/2012\), leveraging her knowledge from project work \( **NAMEME** and **MSPIrishSea**\) and expertise in stakeholder\-led approaches \(3.1\). As noted by a water management company Director \(5.1.a\), “Without Sue’s oversight… the Project would have suffered delays in delivery and a lower overall quality of recommendations”. Stakeholders \(such as offshore renewables, fishing, shipping, recreation and conservation\) were “reminded of their obligation to work together, focusing on their common vision rather than their own individual interests”. 

 These pre\-2014 activities provided the essential capacity for subsequent impact. Crucially, the board recommended 15 MCZs, of which 10, covering 1,309km<sup>2</sup>, were finally designated in 2019 \(5.2.a, 5.2.b\), and for which management measures are now being put in place. For example, the Cumbria Coast MCZ stretches along 27km, protecting 8 key features, including honeycomb worm reefs and rocky habitats; it includes England’s only breeding colony of black guillemots which are now protected from fishing nets during the nesting season thanks to a voluntary netting ban brought in as an MCZ measure \(5.2.c\). 

###  4.1.b   <ins>Irish Sea Maritime Forum</ins> 

 As a result of **MSPIrishSea** \(3.2\) **,** Kidd led the formation of the Irish Sea Maritime Forum \(ISMF\) in 06/2012 \(5.3.a\). This is a partnership of government agencies, industry, and environmental stakeholders from across all six Irish Sea jurisdictions. A Science Advisor of Historic England testifies \(5.3.d\), “The Irish Sea Maritime Forum exists due to Sue’s initiative, vision, and leadership skills. Its successes are largely due to her ability to encourage stakeholders to work together”. The Manger of the NW Coastal Forum states \(5.3.c\), “One of the key … benefits of the Forum includes building stronger networks between Irish Sea users.” Its importance is reflected in high\-level political support; its current chair is a former Irish Senator \(5.3.e\). This has provided the platform for subsequent impact. 

 A 2018 stakeholder review demonstrated that ISMF provides the institutional structure needed to facilitate cooperative management of the Irish sea’s resources:  “The Irish Sea is a natural unit… There is a clear need for transboundary cooperation which is met by the ISMF” \(5.4.a\). 

 Activities between 01/2014 and 02/2020, including well\-attended conferences and stakeholder events \(5.3.b\), have benefitted members as revealed through a survey, for example \(5.4.c\): 

-  “Keeping up to date with all new development” \(Northern Ireland Government\) 

-  “Continued cooperation and understanding of issues/opportunities” \(UK Agency\) 

-  “Build capacity to respond to transnational issues” \(Fisheries industry\) 

-  “Having a wide range of stakeholders allows for better outcomes” \(Planning Authority\) 

 A former Liverpool Councillor states “decision makers, including myself, had our views changed and now, wind energy in the Irish Sea is a significant and growing economic and environmental benefit” \(5.4.e\). 

 In addition to these governance changes, impacts include: securing funding worth over €8 million for projects supporting EU Directives for environmental quality and marine planning; *Blue Growth Prospectus for the Irish Sea Region* 2015 setting out opportunities for shipping, blue energy, fisheries, blue biotechnology and tourism \(5.4.b\); and the Ireland\-Wales Interreg project *Ecostructure* that developed concepts for multi\-functional natural and hard sea defences \(5.4.d\). 

##  4.2 Application of Tools for Implementing National and Regional Marine Legislation 

 Marine ecosystem\-based management needs practical approaches that can be used to implement policy and legislation effectively. We have developed tools to enable national agencies to manage their marine resources in the context of two legislative frameworks: the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive and South Africa’s Marine Spatial Planning Act. 

###  4.2.a    <ins>Marine Management Strategies in the Netherlands</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>Ireland</ins> <ins>and beyond</ins> 

 The EU’s 2008 *Marine Strategy Framework Directive* \(MSFD\) aims to address the deteriorating environmental conditions of European seas, requiring coastal Member States to achieve Good Environmental Status \(GES\) of their marine waters by 2020. However, there was no clear approach for reaching this target. Robinson led the **ODEMM** project that produced a *pressure assessment tool* \(3.3, 3.4\) which enables decision makers to identify the key human pressures acting on their marine ecosystems and to select the best measures for achieving GES \(5.5.a,\). 

 Government agencies have now applied this tool to advise governments in Ireland and the Netherlands. It was adopted in 2014 in Ireland to assess the threats to marine environmental status. This was the “first application of the ODEMM framework… completed for Ireland’s marine waters” \(5.6.b\). The findings were used to advise the Irish government on the selection of management measures which since 2018 have now been used to achieve recovery of Irish marine ecosystems. A Principal Investigator for Ireland’s Marine Institute confirms, “We have carried this out using the assessment approach …developed by Dr Robinson” \(5.6.a\). 

 In the Netherlands, the tool has been adapted to underpin selection of management measures in 2018\-20 which are now being used to achieve the GES objectives across Dutch marine waters and the broader North Sea. The Dutch principal Investigator on marine ecosystem\-based management states, “The risk\-based pressure assessment approach developed by Dr Robinson’s team is a really significant contribution to the field because it allows managers the ability to weigh up different options for sustainable use of marine ecosystems. Without this, single\-sector based approaches miss the significant effects of multiple pressures acting on marine species and habitats” \(5.6.c\). 

 The tool has also been used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea \(ICES\), an intergovernmental marine science organisation for the Northeast Atlantic \(5.7a\). The ODEMM tool is now a key part of the technical guidance for the ICES Ecosystem Overviews \(5.7b\), the first set of which were published in 2019\-20 and have affected decisions on ecosystem\-based management across the region over this time\-frame. The ICES Chair testifies, “Leonie’s work in the field of ecosystem\-based marine management has made a very significant contribution to the field both in Europe and across the broader Atlantic region” \(5.6a\). 

###  4.2.b    <ins>Marine Spatial Planning in South Africa</ins> 

 Marine spatial planning \(MSP\) has been introduced by many coastal nations to provide an integrated approach to regulated marine industries; it is now central to marine policy and practice in Europe. MSP was identified as a national priority in 2014 in South Africa, to help manage its extensive and internationally significant marine waters straddling the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with great ecological diversity and social and economic importance. 

 Following his leadership of **MSP projects** and his international reputation \(3.5, 3.6\), Jay was invited onto South Africa’s National Working Group tasked with producing the *National Framework for Marine Spatial Planning*, 09/2015\-03/2016. He was the sole academic in the group, working alongside representatives of government departments. Jay led on the practical section of the Framework, setting out the steps and timeline to be followed by the government department now responsible for MSP in South Africa. He encouraged the adaptation of MSP to the South African context, such as MSP being a tool for redressing historic racial injustices. 

 The Framework was approved by the Minister of Environmental Affairs in 05/2017 \(5.8.b\). It is cross\-referenced in South Africa’s *Marine Spatial Planning Act* 05/2018 \(5.8.c\). Jay’s involvement was coordinated by the German agency for international cooperation who provided logistical support to the process, and described him as having a “significant role” and “an important role in developing the procedural aspects of the Framework” \(5.8.a\). 

 The initial stages of the Framework are now being carried out \(5.8.d\). Firstly, a data portal has been developed that gathers, and makes publicly available, digital data on a wide range of marine characteristics and human activities, providing the evidence base for the marine plans \(5.9.a\). Secondly, four bioregional Marine Planning Areas have been designated. Work is now beginning on the first of these, the Eastern Cape region. Jay continues to support this process. A Director at the Dept of Environment, Forestry & Fisheries confirms that Jay is “currently facilitating international exchange… between government agencies responsible for marine spatial planning in the Global South” \(5.9.b\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Globally, support for recovery after stroke is substandard. Insights from our original research on priority areas for improving post\-stroke recovery have been instrumental for the development of novel educational resources on vision rehabilitation and secondary stroke prevention \(including physical activity and sedentary behaviour\) for service users and providers in stroke rehabilitation and recovery support. These new resources, used by over 20,000 service users in 134 countries and completed by over 3,100 service providers within the UK and abroad \(including Ireland, Australia, New Zealand\), have raised educational standards and enabled the development of innovative, evidence\-based stroke rehabilitation and recovery support services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research focuses on evidence gaps, prioritised through the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership on Life after Stroke, led by Pollock and Davis, i.e. vision rehabilitation and secondary stroke prevention. 

 Interventions for visual problems were investigated by Pollock and Hazelton in the first high quality Cochrane systematic review evidence synthesis on the topic \[R1, G1\]. It demonstrated that specific eye movement training was a promising intervention and could improve stroke survivors’ quality of life \- but existing clinical practice did not reflect the available evidence \[R2\]. Pollock, Hazelton and Brady conducted the first nation\-wide survey \(with a response rate of 90%\) of treatments for stroke\-related visual problems in 2011 \[R2\]. They identified important gaps and variations in care across Scottish inpatient clinical settings and key barriers to evidence\-based practice, particularly a lack of training, guidelines and pathways. 

 Secondary prevention lifestyle interventions after stroke were investigated by Lawrence et al. in their 2015 systematic review and meta\-analysis \[R3, G2\]. Using Cochrane methodology, this high quality review highlighted that these interventions improved lifestyle behaviours and physiological outcomes. In particular, behavioural interventions reduced blood pressure, waist circumference and increased compliance with medication \(anti\-thrombotics, statins\), thereby significantly reducing the odds of subsequent cardiac events. An accompanying qualitative review \[R4, G2\] highlighted important benefits of group\-based secondary prevention interventions from the perspectives of stroke survivors and family members: feeling supported by others, acquiring new knowledge, and gaining confidence. This breakthrough in understanding provided new insights into how self\-management of secondary stroke prevention by people affected by stroke could be optimised. 

 Further research on lifestyle interventions focused on physical activity and sedentary behaviour; the systematic review by van Wijck et al. in 2013 \[R5\] on physical activity was the first to comprehensively investigate stroke survivors’ perceptions on psychosocial, physical and environmental barriers and facilitators to physical activity, following robust methodology. Findings highlighted that stroke\-specific concerns \(e.g. fear of subsequent stroke, post\-stroke fatigue, embarrassment in a gym environment\), lack of motivation \(e.g. through depression, anxiety\) and environmental factors were the main barriers, and that social support and the desire to get back to valued activities were the most important facilitators to post\-stroke physical activity. These insights were essential for the development of specialist educational resources to better engage stroke survivors in physical activity. Sedentary behaviour, independently associated with high mortality and morbidity, was investigated by Tieges, van Wijck and Chastin in 2015 \[R6, G3\]. Utilising state\-of\-the\-art objective activity monitoring, it investigated behaviour patterns in the largest cohort and longest follow\-up period \(i.e. one year\) of studies published at the time. A key finding was that sedentary behaviour was independent of stroke survivors’ mobility levels and did not improve spontaneously – even in those able to walk independently. These surprising new findings highlighted the need to develop novel behaviour change interventions specifically to reduce sedentary behaviour after stroke. 

 Taken together, insights from this body of work were instrumental for designing novel, evidence\-based educational resources and services to address important evidence gaps affecting service users and providers.

This review, part of a suite of four Cochrane systematic reviews addressing visual problems in stroke, was the first to systematically identify, appraise and meta\-analyse the data relating to interventions for this population, addressing an important gap in the literature – a gap, known to be a barrier to clinicians’ ability to provide evidence\-based care. Using Cochrane methods, internationally known for their rigour, this review has been used to underpin national stroke guidelines in the UK, USA and Australia. It is very widely read, with an attention score within the top 5% of all research outputs \(Altmetric, 11.12.20\). This review has provided evidence for the most promising treatment approaches to use with stroke survivors with visual field loss – specifically scanning training approaches.

[https://doi.org/10.1310/tsr18s01\-643](https://doi.org/10.1310/tsr18s01-643). This robust survey study, which achieved a 90% response rate through the use of evidence\-based survey design principles, was the first to address service provision for those with visual problems after stroke across Scottish inpatient clinical settings. It provided the first evidence of assessment methods, their frequency of use and the management approaches across the spectrum of different post\-stroke visual impairments. By focussing on Occupational Therapists based in all the acute stroke wards, it provided a ground\-breaking and comprehensive picture of clinical practice. The survey identified important variations and gaps in care provision after stroke \(especially in relation to eye movement disorders\). Importantly, it also enabled us to identify the main barriers to improving care, which included the lack of clinical guidance and poor access to specialist training.

This comprehensive and methodologically robust systematic review made an original contribution to the field of physical activity after stroke, as it was the first to synthesise quantitative and qualitative evidence on psychosocial, physical and environmental barriers and facilitators to post\-stroke physical activity. Its contribution was significant as this area was poorly understood and this evidence gap limited the ability of healthcare and exercise professionals to take into consideration a wide range of factors, including stroke survivors’ perceptions, when designing person\-centred physical activity interventions. Findings from this review made an important contribution to our insight into a wide range of stroke\-specific factors that need to be addressed to better engage stroke survivors in physical activity.

This observational study made an original contribution to our understanding of enduring sedentary behaviour patterns after stroke, as it was the first to follow a cohort of stroke survivors for 12 months– the longest follow\-up period investigated at the time. Utilising state\-of\-the\-art objective activity monitoring devices, this rigorously conducted repeated measures study provided an essential point of reference in the field, by demonstrating not only the amount, fragmentation and diurnal time curve of sedentary behaviour, but also its lack of change over time in the largest cohort of stroke survivors investigated at the time. These findings generated the insight that novel lifestyle interventions after stroke were needed that specifically targeted sedentary behaviour patterns after stroke.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research has been instrumental in the development of novel educational resources for the benefit of healthcare professionals \(including nurses, therapists, psychologists, GPs, paramedics, optometrists\), social care workers and specialist exercise professionals, and people affected by stroke within the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US, India, Brazil, and the Philippines. These resources have raised educational standards and enabled the development of innovative, evidence\-based stroke rehabilitation and recovery support services. The need for high\-quality stroke workforce education is highlighted in the Scottish Government’s Stroke Improvement Plan, the European Stroke Organisation’s Action Plan for Stroke in Europe 2018\-2030 and the World Stroke Organisation, as specialist education is essential for delivering stroke\-specific care to improve outcomes. 

 **Impact 1: Resource and service development for professionals: evidence\-based practice** 

 <ins>Vision rehabilitation</ins> <ins>after stroke</ins> 

 Based on the systematic review by Pollock et al. \(2011\) \[R1\], Hazelton was invited to contribute to the Stroke Training and Awareness Resources ‘Vision’ module, an innovative online professional education resource hosted by Chest Heart Stroke Scotland and commissioned by the Scottish Government as part of their Stroke Education Pathway. Over the impact period, an average of 395 module completion certificates per year were issued to health and social care professionals across the UK, North America, Australia, and the Middle East \[C1\]. 

 Evidence from the Cochrane review \[R1\] and UK\-wide practice survey \[R2\] also inspired a new GCU\-led collaboration between Hazelton, GCU Vision Science faculty \(Seidel\) and low vision service providers \(Visibility UK\), which initiated the UK’s first specialist Optometry Neuro\-Vision Rehabilitation clinic at GCU in 2017. Providing specialist assessment, diagnosis and rehabilitation post\-stroke, it has seen approximately 50 people from across Scotland \[C2\]. Hazelton’s survey \[R2\] was also instrumental in initiating and informing the first Best Practice Statement for stroke\-related visual impairment in Scotland \(2013\) \[C3\]. Alongside evidence\-based recommendations \[R1\], this Statement underpinned a new Stroke and Vision Pathway in NHS Lanarkshire in 2015 \[C3\]. This subsequently led to post\-stroke visual impairment being recognised as a clinical priority in the Scottish Government’s Stroke Improvement Plan \(2019\), which requires specialist services to be available to all people with post\-stroke visual impairment across NHS Scotland and audits their delivery \[C3\]. 

 <ins>Physical activity</ins> <ins>after stroke</ins> 

 Research by Tieges, Chastin, van Wijck on post\-stroke physical activity and sedentary behaviour \[R5\-6\] has been embedded in the Exercise after Stroke Specialist Instructor Course, the first Higher Education Institution\-validated course of its kind in the UK, led by van Wijck and delivered by Later Life Training \(LLT\). LLT provides evidence\-based specialist training for health and exercise professionals. A total of 401 LLT professionals have been qualified since the inclusion of R5 in course updates \(of which 383 since the inclusion of R6\), to deliver novel, evidence\-based exercise after stroke services across UK communities \[C4\]. LLT\-qualified professionals were selected by the Stroke Association to deliver their new Moving Forward after Stroke service in 2017, which was rolled out to 9 sites across the UK, reaching over 800 stroke survivors \[C6\]. This service resulted in perceived benefits in physical recovery, mental health and confidence \[C5\-6\]. Attendees reported engaging in moderate exercise on 5 days on average, compared to 3 days per week before the programme, and many joined a gym following the programme \[C5\-6\]. 

 **Impact 2: Resource development for people affected by stroke: evidence\-based self\-management** 

 <ins>Secondary stroke prevention</ins> 

 Based on her programme of research on family\-centred secondary stroke prevention \[R3\-R4, G2\], Lawrence was invited in 2014 as a topic expert on the Steering group of SelfHelp4Stroke, the first free, online self\-management resource hosted by Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland to support people affected by stroke. This innovative resource, developed in collaboration with the Interactive Content Team at the University of Edinburgh, was highly commended in the British Medical Association Patient Information Awards 2016. Lawrence led the multi\-professional team that developed the content for the stroke secondary prevention module ‘Keeping Well’, and contributed subject expertise to the ‘Getting Started’ module \[C1\]. Based on her research on barriers and motivators to post\-stroke physical activity \[R5\] and sedentary behaviour \[R6\], van Wijck was also invited in 2014 to contribute to SelfHelp4Stroke. This research was instrumental in designing the ‘Being Active’ module, which encouraged stroke survivors to be less sedentary, and to address their barriers to progress to a more active lifestyle \[C1\]. From launch in 2015 to May 2020, more than 21,000 people affected by stroke from 134 countries \(including the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US, India, Brazil, the Philippines\) have used SelfHelp4Stroke to support them in their self\-management \[C1\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 UWE’s Paired Peers research project led by Professor Harriet Bradley, resulted in socially and economically disadvantaged university students nationally having better access to the personal and professional opportunities offered by the university experience. The underpinning research, funded by successive grants from the Leverhulme Trust, revealed how social class inequality affects university admissions, student experiences and graduate outcomes. Through informing the work of prominent bodies including the Social Mobility Commission, HEFCE, OfS, Sutton Trust, and universities across the sector, the research led to changes in government guidance, third sector interventions, and improvements to widening participation practice and university admissions policies. More broadly, it has shaped institutional thinking and priorities; influencing how students benefit from university and their transition into employment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Social class has long influenced a young person’s likelihood of going to university, and for those who do, the institution attended, subject studied and graduate outcomes. This longitudinal, largely qualitative project identified the processes by which such inequalities are operationalised and maintained. 

 Paired Peers consisted of Phase One \(2010\-2013; **G1**\), and Phase Two \(2014\-2017; **G2**\), following an initial cohort of 90 undergraduates studying one of eleven degree subjects at either Bristol’s University of the West of England \(UWE\) or the University of Bristol \(UoB\). We recruited four students at each institution per subject, two working\-class and two middle\-class, permitting comparison between their experiences and outcomes by class, gender, institution attended and subject studied. Phase Two followed 56 of the original participants for three years beyond graduation. We examined the processes by which higher education promotes social mobility and/or maintains existing social inequalities and made recommendations for policy\-makers and practitioners to address the issues identified. 

 **Phase One: The Student Experience** Phase One highlighted the higher rate of working\-class students dropping out of university \( **R1**\), and for those remaining, the disparity in poorer students’ access to activities including work placements and internships, and engagement with cultural events and/or university clubs and societies \( **R2**, **R3**\). This limited their opportunities for CV enhancement and for benefitting more widely from their time at university. The barriers to participation identified were partly financial \(i.e. the activity’s cost, or the need to spend non\-study time earning money\), resulting in us recommending improved financial support schemes for students from poorer backgrounds to fully access and benefit from such activities \( **R2**, **R3**\). 

 Reduced CV enhancement possibilities subsequently restricted working\-class students’ access to many graduate employment opportunities, which we identified as *‘a shift in the rules of the game’* \( **R2** p741\). Working\-class students faced cultural barriers too, with many upper middle\-class students being far more cognisant of needing to undertake such activities to improve their appeal to graduate employers.  This sort of knowledge was advantageous to middle\-class students during the transition into graduate careers \( **R3**, **R4**, **R5**\), maintaining social inequalities despite mass participation in higher education. 

 **Phase Two: Graduate Outcomes**Phase Two revealed post\-university patterns marked by divergence regarding employment or further study \( **R2**, **R4**\). As we predicted, these variable experiences are significantly informed by class and, to a lesser extent, gender \( **R4**, **R5**, **R6**\). Working\-class students generally settled more slowly into careers and earned less. Fewer remained in Bristol for work or moved to London where graduate opportunities were more widely available, largely for financial reasons; they often lacked the necessary monetary support or social networks to move to, or remain in, areas of high housing costs whilst earning lower graduate entry\-level salaries \( **R4**\). Sharp gender differences were exposed, with greater numbers of women entering teaching, despite this not being a declared aspiration when the project started \( **R3**, **R4**, **R5**\). 

 We noted at the end of Phase One a strong institutional effect \( **R3**\). The UoB ‘cachet’ is attractive to employers and some UoB working\-class students benefitted accordingly \( **R2**, **R4**, **R5**\); conversely some middle\-class UWE students ended in less prestigious jobs than they anticipated. Phase Two demonstrated a compounding of these institutional effects regarding ongoing employment opportunities. We found that educational capital alone is insufficient to secure successful graduate outcomes; the ‘rules of the game’ have changed, continuing to advantage those from middle\-class backgrounds enjoying access to informal networks.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Policy\-makers and government bodies**Paired Peers research informed OFFA’s guidance supporting students to improve retention and attainment of under\-represented and disadvantaged groups, helping OfS *‘develop new guidance better addressing the needs of different groups’* and influencing *‘\[its\] strategic focus on access, retention and success’* \( **S1**\). 

 Influencing HEFCE’s thinking on tackling differential outcomes, Paired Peers fed into the Addressing Barriers to Student Success programme and specification, which promotes equality of opportunity and improves student experience \( **S1**\). 

 Paired Peers’ identification of the challenges faced by, and requirement to support WP students, influenced the 2014 *National Strategy for Access and Student Success in Higher Education*’s focus on retention and success \( **S1**; **S2**, p55\). The strategy’s legacy is a far greater emphasis on the full student lifecycle, with a stronger focus on continuation, attainment and progression into further study and work \( **S1**\). 

 The Social Mobility Commission \(SMC\)’s major *State of the Nation 2018\-2019* report is *‘directly influenced’* by **R2** and **R3** in its conclusions on how socio\-economic background affects students’ experiences \( **S3**, p94; **S4**\), and its recommendations to government on the divided culture and access to financial support \( **S3**, p103; **S4**\). **R2**’s findings on the importance of access to extra\-curricular activities were adopted by social mobility charity The Sutton Trust in an important report, *Leading People 2016: The Educational Backgrounds of the UK Professional Elite* \( **S4**\), along with recommendations from **R3**. Those findings also informed SMC/Sutton Trust’s report *Elitist Britain 2019: The educational backgrounds of Britain’s ‘leading people’*, shaping recommendations for organisations addressing the issue of associating ’talent’ with characteristics unconnected to performance. Paired Peers’ findings \( **R2**, **R3**\) also led to SMC arguing for greater financial support schemes for students from poorer backgrounds \( **S4**\). 

 A further key impact attributed to Paired Peers is a change in working practice within OfS. OfS now works more closely with academics, finding from its experience on Paired Peers that this generates greater buy\-in and has a stronger effect on behavioural change \( **S1**\). 

 **R5**’s insights into differential gendered graduate outcomes informed a 2019 Government Equalities Office report on Women’s Progression in the Workplace on the importance of support networks \( **S5**, p28\) and cultures of presenteeism \( **S5**, pp29\-30, p49\). 

 **Third sector organisations**The Chief Programmes Manager at social mobility and youth development charity Villiers Park Educational Trust states, *‘outcomes from Paired Peers continue to impact on the work of third sector organisations’* \( **S6**\), supporting practitioners’ engagement with key concepts including social and cultural capital, and facilitating *‘targeted evidence\-informed interventions’*. At Villiers Park, 

 *‘its discussion of the differential student experiences of social, cultural and academic transition…informs the design of our programmes, especially our focus on supporting pre\-HE students to develop the skills, behaviours and knowledge needed to avoid falling foul of the ‘hidden curriculum’’* \( **S6**\). 

 In 2014, Debrett’s established a charitable foundation to support and champion social mobility and offer opportunities to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Paired Peers research was *‘a point of evidence in building awareness’* among influential individuals, helping 

 *‘demonstrate the need for the Foundation and to ensure the vital support required to launch, maintain and fund it was obtained’* \( **S7**\). 

 The Bridge Group works with universities and employer groups to expand access to graduate employment opportunities. Paired Peers informed its reports \(2018, 2020\) into higher education, graduate careers and social mobility, *‘shaped wider thinking for the charity on uneven graduate outcomes by social background’* and provided a *‘much needed longitudinal research’* evidence base \( **S8**\). 

 **University sector**Paired Peers intensified university sector focus on the impact of being ‘first in family’ into HE, in terms of access and student success \( **S6**\). Its findings have fed into access agreements across a wide range of universities \( **S1**\) with institutions changing specific policies on WP and the student experience. One WP expert testifies, 

 *‘\[Paired Peers\] has had a significant influence on contemporary WP practice and delivery often directly, but also through introducing evidence\-informed factors that have been more broadly absorbed into sector thinking’* \( **S6**\). 

 At the University of Sheffield, Paired Peers *‘had a clear impact on working practices’* \( **S6**\), addressing disparities in HE application and decision\-making knowledge; social ‘fit’ and first year transition; access to the ‘hidden curriculum’; and work experience bursaries supporting disadvantaged students. It increased focus on a *‘whole student lifecycle’* approach to WP: **R3**’s *‘getting in’*, *‘getting on’*, *‘getting out’* structure influenced the University’s 2012\-13 Access Agreement. The research shaped the University’s own longitudinal student experience project, and the success and profile of Paired Peers made a *‘significant contribution’* to securing funding for additional research following students into careers \( **S6**\). 

 From 2015 onwards the University of Bristol introduced policies addressing 10 key recommendations from Phase One, including funded internships for members of underrepresented groups, a fee waiver and bursary scheme, an accommodation bursary encouraging greater social mixing in halls of residence, professional mentoring for undergraduates, and postgraduate bursaries for students from low\-income families \( **S9**\). 

 At Oxford Brookes University the decision to make the building of cultural capital a core aspect of the student employability strategy in 2016 was *‘directly driven’* by Paired Peers research \( **S10**\). Waller’s research on the impact of cultural capital on student employment choices was also *‘a critical strand of strategic direction’* at Bucks New University \( **S10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by the England’s Immigrants project revealing the extent and nature of the resident ‘alien’ population of late Medieval England has made previously inaccessible archival material freely available in a new, online database of known migrants, to new audiences, so contributing to public debate about the long history of immigration into England. It influenced the design and content of school curricula and the delivery of primary and secondary school education on the history of migration. It achieved this impact through working in partnership with The National Archives, the national Schools History Project and the national Historical Association, whose policies and practices in the dissemination of medieval history and the training of teachers were changed as a result. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The AHRC\-funded *England’s Immigrants* project \(GBP784,545, 2012\-15\) was undertaken by PI Prof W. Mark Ormrod and a project team at the University of York in partnership with The National Archives \(TNA\) and the Humanities Research Institute \(HRI\), University of Sheffield. The project demonstrated that far from the history of England being that of an isolated ‘island’ with a history of immigration shaped only by infrequent large\-scale events \(such as the Norman Conquest\), by contrast, permanent long\-term, small\-scale connections and migrations between Europe, the wider World, and England were commonplace. Research by Professor Ormrod and the project team provided major evidence for the first time of this small\-scale but significant migration to England between 1330\-1550 by creating a fully searchable database \[3.1\] that contains the names and details of over 64,000 people who settled in England in the late middle ages \(The  England’s Immigrants Database, EIDB\). \(IT support for the development of the database and dissemination of the research online was provided by the HRI at the University of Sheffield\). This database comprises translated, edited and transcribed archival material, principally from the ‘Alien Subsidies’ \(from series E179 at TNA\), as well as early Tudor subsidies and letters of Denization and Protection, which record the names, origins, places of residence, occupations and households of the resident ‘alien’ population. Prior research on late medieval immigration was largely restricted to major cities, such as London, Bristol, or York, and high\-status immigrant groups, making use of the extensive archival material only sporadically. The database allows the user to focus on places and individuals neglected in earlier scholarship; for the first time, these records have been used to create as comprehensive a picture as possible of migration to medieval England \[3.2\]. 

 The database has provided a much needed contextual basis for further research re\-examining all aspects of immigration in the late medieval period \[3.2\]. This included new studies of previously omitted immigrant groups or migrant destinations \[3.3\], and a re\-examination of political, economic, social and cultural contexts of migration \[3.4\]. It has shown medieval English society’s preoccupations about foreigners and supported new research which examines this small\-scale immigration in light of issues relating to questions about assimilation and multiculturalism in ‘English’ society, during a period of civil and international political turmoil in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries \[3.5, 3.6\]. Notable discoveries included: the scale and impact of economic migration, the wide distribution of immigrants across England, the large numbers of low status and otherwise often\-unrecorded individuals \(including women\), the presence and economic contribution of political refugees from Europe, the first records of named individuals immigrating from beyond Europe. 

 The research therefore revealed and highlighted the diversity and full extent of the medieval immigrant experience, and in so doing contributed an important historical dimension to current debates about immigration to Britain from Europe and the wider world. 

 An AHRC Follow on Fund for Impact and Engagement \(GBP69,165, 2016, PI W. Mark Ormrod\) developed new teaching materials from the original project’s research in partnership with TNA and the Historical Association \(HA\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The *England’s Immigrants* project has contributed to public debate about the history of immigration by providing access to previously inaccessible medieval archives documenting aliens born overseas but living within the later medieval kingdom of England. Its research contributed to changes in the primary and secondary schools’ curriculum for History through providing a new focus on a neglected period of migration history. Finally, it contributed to changes in teaching practice through the development of specialised continuing professional development \(CPD\) in the use of medieval resources and content for teachers nationally. 

1.  **Informing public debate by making archival material newly accessible** 

 The online resources of the *England’s Immigrants* project and database \(EIDB\) \[3.1\] have provided, for the first time, public access to unpublished and difficult\-to\-understand medieval archives and enhanced them with user\-friendly research tools, consistent with The National Archives’ aims to increase public engagement with their harder\-to\-reach holdings. 

 Engagement with the website has been impressive and we have analytics that show evidence of wide and sustained reach. For example, since its launch in February 2015 the database on the project website has been visited 173,506 times and has received 1,242,572 page views. On average each user viewed 7 pages per visit. 22.3% of visits were 'return visits' by frequent users, whilst 77.7% of visits were 'first time' visits by new users. 61,456 visits were in response to a Google search, 59,169 visits were direct \(the user typing in the URL\), 29,954 visits were referrals from other websites \(mainly TNA and Google Classroom\), and 21,192 visits were via social media links \(mainly Facebook and Twitter\) \[as of 30 November 2020\]. A survey carried out between Autumn 2017 and Spring 2018 showed that 67.5% used the site for academic research, 17.5 % for local or family history, 22.5% for teaching and 15% for general interest \(users could tick more than one box\). 84.8% of users’ perceptions of the breadth and diversity of the immigrant population of medieval England were changed \[5.1, pp. 42\-5\]. 

 The website, including team blog posts, has been cited in media outlets including *BBC News*, *Indy100,* *The Guardian* and *BBC History Extra*; in total these articles have been viewed an estimated 1,070,000 times and shared 4,690 times on social media \[5.2\]. Google analytics show that the coverage on *Indy100* led to nearly 500 readers visiting the England’s Immigrants website, suggesting that media coverage sparked onwards interest from readers \[5.1 p. 42\]. The research also featured in magazine articles for the *BBC History Magazine* and 15 radio interviews for local BBC radio, as well as a series of press articles, often linked to current debate on immigration particularly in relation to Britain’s membership of the EU. 

 The project has substantially enhanced public use of medieval records at The National Archives. The Head of Medieval Records at TNA comments that ‘The project web page is now linked prominently as part of TNA’s general guidance on immigrants across all time periods’, it ‘is a core part of TNA’s specialist training for staff deployment at the on\-site and remote enquiry service points’ and ‘TNA’s medieval and early modern teams use and cite the website in remote correspondence, live online chat, and face\-to face interaction with researchers in the document reading rooms’ \[5.3a\]. In the period between January 2018 and July 2020 a total of 1,195 users clicked through from the main TNA Discovery website to the project website \(a mean average per month of 3.33% TNA total online users\) \[5.1 App. H\]. It has also informed the development of the National Archives’ *Traces through Time* project by providing, as the Head of Medieval Records notes, ‘a range of excellent technical points of reference’ and making discussion about the project ‘more productive than it would otherwise have been’ \- all part of what he describes as *England’s Immigrants*’ approach to records management ‘inspiring specialists to continue broader conversations about the digital re\-use of entire digitised texts or extracted key data’ at TNA \[5.3a\]. 

1.  **Supporting the revised OCR History GCSE syllabus** 

 The project has contributed to the new national curriculum for History. In summer 2014 the three main examination boards \(AQA, Edexcel and OCR\) revised their GCSE and A level History syllabuses. The OCR chose to include two modules on the history of migration including an emphasis on pre\-modern periods. In September 2014 OCR contacted the *England’s Immigrants* project to request support for the new modules, in particular on the medieval period and migration. The project team worked with one of the co\-authors of the new textbook supporting the revised OCR curriculum to write the textbook’s medieval section. The database features prominently in the textbook, including excerpts and screenshots of database material and explanations of how to use it \[5.4a\]. Before the availability of the database, suitably accessible research to support curriculum content on medieval migration was lacking. As the textbook co\-author writes: ‘Had there not been the work of the project and the online database in such accessible form, the quality of our resources for schools would have been greatly diminished and the story we told severely limited’ \[5.4b\]. 

 The OCR also worked with The Runnymede Trust to produce a major online resource for schools to support the new modules. In March 2016 the *England’s Immigrants* project was also invited to become part of The Runnymede Trust’s ‘Our Migration Story’. The website was launched in October 2016 and includes materials drawing on the project’s research written by project members Ormrod, Lutkin and Payne \[5.5a\]. The publication of these materials attracted a great deal of public comment \[5.5b\]. In September 2017 the website won the Community Integration Awards Research Champion award. The citation states, ‘this disrupts and unsettles unhelpful, binary narratives around “Them and Us”’ and ‘enriches the curriculum, makes research relevant and focuses on influencing future generations’ \[5.5c\]. In January 2018 the website won the Royal Historical Society’s Public History Online Resource award. In April 2019 it won The Guardian University Award 2019 for Research Impact. It was also cited by Helen Hayes, MP, and the Minister for School Standards, Nick Gibb, during a parliamentary debate about the teaching of migration in the history curriculum, as an example of best practice in this area \[5.6\]. 

1.  **Enhancing the Professional and Personal Development of Teachers** 

 The project has developed the skills, understanding and career development of school teachers. Following the curriculum changes in 2016 the project team worked with TNA through their Teacher Scholar Programme \(TSP\) led by TNA’s Head of Education and Outreach, the Historical Association \(HA\), and an education consultant \(Chief Examiner, OCR\) to train teachers to teach the long history of migration and to prepare teaching resources for all key stages of the curriculum from ages 5 to 18 \[5.3b, 5.7, 5.8\]. This involved intensive and prolonged knowledge exchange between teachers, academics and teacher educators in targeted workshops over 14 weeks. From these initial engagements seven primary and secondary school history teachers from around the UK were selected to create new teaching resources, including lesson plans, activity sheets and contextual essays for teachers and are hosted on TNA’s Education website \(more details below, sub\-section 4.5\). 

 At the time \(2015\-16\), this was TNA’s fifth TSP with University Partners. TNA’s Head of Education and Outreach  noted  that the participation rate had been higher than in previous TNA TSPs, ‘with more contributions of a higher quality from participants in both online discussions and in the post\-programme dissemination work’ \(including TSP participants contributing to training sessions run with the HA and the Schools History Project\) \[5.3b\]. An independent evaluation conducted with the teacher participants revealed that the programme had increased the depth and breadth of their knowledge of the medieval period, deepened their understanding of how historians work \(one participant, for example, noted the programme was a reminder of how history works ‘as a living process and not a formulaic exercise’\), had produced resources they had used in their own teaching practice and which had been taken up by colleagues, and inspired and empowered them in their roles as teachers \[5.1, pp. 26\-30\]. The results of the TSP were then disseminated at three national teacher conferences from 2015 to 2017 and a further workshop at the Museum of London in 2018. 81% of the 11 teachers who returned feedback forms from one workshop indicated that learning about EIDB changed their perception of history based on previous very low levels of knowledge concerning the medieval period \[5.1 App. P\]. One Head of Department reported: ‘At the moment we don’t teach immigration at all \[but we are now\] planning to create a few lessons for Year 7 to cover medieval migration on both a national and local level’ \[5.1\]. One teacher was inspired to change her career path as a result of engagement with the TSP. She writes: ‘Ultimately the whole experience is what led me to shift career paths. I had come to a point in my teaching career where I \[wanted to spend more time\] engaging with historical research, creative development of learning resources and the joy of learning both for my students and myself’ \[5.3c\]. Other teachers gained promotions at their respective schools in part as a result of their involvement. For the project’s education consultant, this was part of, and a result of, the ‘transformative experience’ of the programme for the teachers \[5.8\]. 

1.  **Informing the development of Teacher Scholar Programmes at The National Archives and the Historical Association** 

 TNA have improved elements of their provision for teachers as a result of the success of the *England’s Immigrants* TSP. The Head of Education and Outreach at TNA wrote that ‘The partnership \[with EIDB\] has been our most successful collaboration to date in developing a teacher scholar programme which both develops teacher knowledge and produces high quality classroom resources…. The embedding of new academic research within both the development of these teaching resources and the resources themselves has been a significant part of their appeal and success’ \[5.3b\]. This success has had a further sustained impact on TNA’s operation of similar programmes in conjunction with other partner universities and schools. The Head of Education and Outreach writes that the partnership allowed them to ‘develop the TSP programme format and ensure the outputs are even stronger’: ‘Our planning and processes for ensuring really effective teacher outputs have improved as a result of the success of the Medieval Immigrants programme, and we are carrying this forward into our next TSP \[...\]. We have developed clearer guidance for the teachers in how to author materials effectively for others to use in the classroom. We have also developed a much more effective activity programme for the field study element which has allowed the teacher participants to work collaboratively much earlier in the programme. This has had benefits both for their own subject knowledge and for the quality of their outputs by providing more time for classroom testing and feedback’ \[5.3b\]. 

 The *England's Immigrants* TSP also influenced the HA's Teacher Fellowship Programme. As the Chief Executive Officer of the HA writes: ‘Working with TNA and York on the development of the Teacher Scholar Programme had a significant impact on how the HA shaped their Fellowship programme \[...\] A major learning outcome for both TNA and the HA from the *England’s Immigrants* TSP was in how to build greater capacity in the teaching workforce to develop resources that could be used beyond their own schools. Coupled with that was to encourage teachers to present their learning at CPD events. Several have now presented at HA events including the HA’s national conference and the Schools History Project conference: both are large national events’ \[5.7\]. 

1.  **Enhancing the Knowledge of School Students** 

 As a result of all these initiatives the project has enriched the learning of school students by both illustrating the relevance of medieval history to current debates and providing rich resources for project work relating to migration history. The new teaching resources produced by teachers in the *England’s Immigrants* follow\-on project have increased teachers’ and students’ exposure to new academic research, helping to deliver better quality classroom teaching on medieval England in key stages 2\-5. Since August 2016 they have been hosted free online on TNA’s Education website \[5.9\]. Since June 2017 TNA reports a total of 1,576 lesson downloads, with usage increasing year on year \(534 downloads in the first half of 2020 alone\) \[5.1, pp. 31\-2\]. In August 2020 TNA’s Head of Medieval Records reported that the resources are being included in TNA’s upcoming BAME histories teaching resources and being redesigned to encourage new discovery \[5.1, App. H\]. 

 Both the OCR examination board and the Schools History Project have utilised the material to run resource development projects in schools around the country, such as that held at the Plume Academy in 2017 \[5.10\]. The Principal and Subject Leader for History reported that ‘ *England’s Immigrants* has proved an outstanding resource for both teacher and student alike. The quality and depth of material made available has greatly enriched our knowledge of both migration and medieval history’ \[5.10\]. Nick Gibb, The Minister for School Standards, noted the inclusion of migration in OCR’s GCSE History syllabus in a 2019 parliamentary debate, and gives figures for uptake of the migration module: ‘In 2018, 25% of schools chose to offer OCR’s GCSE History A, and nearly 1,500 students took migration as an optional topic with OCR on GCSE History B’ \[5.6\]. OCR confirm that numbers have stayed the same over the two years the course has run so far, and that, taken together, students choosing the migration option in History A and History B represent nearly 20% of the overall OCR History GCSE cohort \[5.1 App. N\]. The co\-author of the textbook which supports this curriculum gives a sense of the diversity of this uptake: ‘Schools studying the course and using the \[England’s Immigrants\] database range from a private school in North London to a comprehensive in inner Bradford, from a rural academy in Gloucestershire to community schools in West London, from central Norwich to the country’s second biggest secondary school in Milton Keynes’ \[5.4b\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The challenges faced by emigrants when establishing a new life in an unfamiliar country with little or no state support can be alleviated by forming and growing diasporic/immigrant associations to enable collective action. Research undertaken at Northumbria University by Professor Tanya Bueltmann applied the historical experience of emigrant communities to inform the operation, growth, and effectiveness of the UK’s largest campaign organisation for EU citizens, the3million \(T3M\), founded in 2016 in response to Brexit. The research informed how the group redefined itself as a grassroots immigrant association, changing how it engaged with, mobilised, and acted on behalf of its 40,000\-strong forum membership. This dual transformation was evident in the scope and focus of T3M’s national ‘This is our Home’ tour and its increased profile as a lobby group, ensuring its recognition by the UK parliament and international thinktanks as a key advocacy group. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since the UK government made its commitment to leave the European Union, it has become clear that the political questions posed by the status of EU citizens resident in the UK resonate with the historic experiences of emigrants and diasporic groups. Emigrants have always faced external challenges when establishing a new life in an unfamiliar country, and diasporic immigrant associations have played important roles in leading and enabling collective action in these contexts. Bueltmann’s extensive body of research \(supported by research grants from the AHRC, ESRC, and the British Academy\), on Scottish, English, and German diasporic communities during the long nineteenth century, and particularly the formation of mutual self\-help organisations, informed changes to the T3M’s identity and ethos, making it more effective in campaigning for the rights of European immigrants in the UK during the crisis period following the EU referendum \[ **R1**\- **R4**\] **.** 

  

 While Bueltmann’s activism on behalf of EU citizens after Brexit drew her and T3M together, it was her transnational research into ethnic associations and wider diaspora networks that helped to transform the organisation’s strategy. Of particular significance is the research’s recognition that the failure of local, provincial, or colonial/federal governments to support immigrant groups, like the Scots in New Zealand or the English in Canada \- places where they were ostensibly equal citizens \- catalysed the formation of social and activism hubs \[ **R1**\- **R4**\] **.** Uncovering diasporic agency is central to this research, which equally establishes how the long\-term social and political significance of working\-class diasporic organisations often outweighed that of elite configurations. Insurance\-based provision and self\-help principles rather than charitable giving was important to this success \[ **R3**\]. Numbers mattered too, and diasporic agency was most effective when immediate ethnic remits were outweighed by the need to build solidarities across diasporic groups. Bueltmann helped T3M recognise the parallel experience of the UK’s multi\-national EU citizenry after the EU referendum result, ensuring the organisation learned lessons from these diasporic experiences \[ **R1**\- **R4**\] **.** 

  

 In particular, this research demonstrates that migrants, even when they were not poor involuntary migrants, but instead opportunity\-seeking voluntary immigrants moving across open borders, still saw the utility of forming associations to represent their interests on a collective level \[ **R2**, **R4**\]. As such, these diasporic experiences chimed with those of highly educated or entrepreneurial EU migrants who are successfully established in UK professions or in business but have felt ‘othered’ by the politics of Brexit. By complicating conventional notions of what constitutes ‘a migrant’, these EU migrants occupy a similar position to the former English diaspora in North America. As this research establishes, though treated in the literature as ‘invisible immigrants’ because thought easily assimilated to Anglophile US culture, the English diaspora, whether ‘settler’ or ‘sojourner’, was as conscious of its ethnicity as any other \[ **R3**, **R4**\]. 

  

 In sum, Bueltmann provides a systematic account of the organisational basis of immigrant diasporic cultures, and through longitudinal evaluations of cultural activities, demonstrates that diasporic communities could be mobilised across class lines, and even nationalities, in pursuit of common interests and goals. This insight proved invaluable to T3M in its attempt to become an effective organization in the interests of immigrants who faced the loss of long\-held rights \[ **R2**\- **R4**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Bueltmann’s studies into historical European migration overseas, identity\-formation, and associationism improved T3M’s understanding of its organisational values and historical legacy, and her research informed its strategy and operations as a grassroots organisation changing how they engaged with, mobilised, and acted on behalf of UK\-based EU citizens. The research enhanced T3M’s advocacy work and policy formulation with the UK Parliament, and with the thinktank, Friedrich\-Ebert\-Stiftung, the oldest political foundation in Germany.In sum, Bueltmann’s research and work with T3M helped 1\) to change its understanding of its organisational values, 2\) inform its strategy and operations as a grassroots organisation, and 3\) enhance its effectiveness as an advocacy body. 

  

 **4.1 Changed understanding of T3M’s organisational values** 

 Recognised in The Big Issue Top 100 Changemakers 2020, T3M carries out lobbying, litigation, and outreach activity with the UK Government, the European Parliament, and with EU citizens. The Communications Manager for T3M explains the usefulness of Bueltmann’s historical research for the organisation, *‘it explored the role of associations in spearheading and facilitating collective action, this was of interest to us because it is what we do, as an association’* \[ **E1**, p1\]. These insights provided T3M with ‘ *a unique perspective on the uncertainty and external challenges encountered by other immigrant groups, historical and more recent, and how grassroots promotion of a shared identity within a wider civic setting, helped immigrant communities to take collective action and engage with diverse stakeholders*’ \[ **E1**, p2\]. 

 This vital historical context gave T3M a strengthened ‘ *sense of purpose’,* and a new understanding of their role as a successor to earlier immigrant associations \[ **E1**, p2\]. They have described how ‘ *like those groups, we too formed in the absence of a responsible state, with individuals coming together and taking collective action to look after our interests as EU citizens*’ \[ **E1**, p1\]. As a result, T3M now possess a ‘ *unique, wider lens’,* through which to understand and assess their own work: 

 *While we represent a community of multiple nationalities, the structure, roles, and civic\-orientated activity of the3million is no different from the historical counterparts Professor Bueltmann discussed with us. This sense of legacy, recognizing the long\-standing role of immigrant associations, has reinforced organisational confidence in the work we do, and must continue to do, in a post\-Brexit landscape* \[ **E1**, p1\]. 

 **4.2 Informed strategy and operations of T3M as a grassroots organisation** 

 T3M learned from Bueltmann’s historical research that activist organisations became more effective by broadening their membership and geographical reach within host countries. To pursue a similar route, T3M required an acute understanding of the needs and concerns of the immigrant groups they claim to represent. This led T3M to again draw on Bueltmann’s research acumen, commissioning her to survey the views of UK\-based EU citizens on the government’s EU Settlement Scheme \(EUSSS\). 



 Bueltmann collected data from over 3,000 respondents, including over 245,000 words in free\-text comments, making this the most extensive record of EU citizens views collected to date. Published in January 2020, the survey results provided T3M, for the first time, with a large\-scale, quantifiable picture of the fracturing of community bonds that had taken place since 2016 among EU citizens \(fig. 1\) \[ **E2**\]. This proved ‘ *invaluable*’ for T3M, enabling them to ‘ *better understand and pursue* \[their\] *core objectives*’ \[ **E1**, p1\]. 

 Coupled with the public report, Bueltmann provided internal analysis for T3M, which helped it to assess the survey \(and what it meant for the organisation\), by comparing the findings with the history and successes of earlier immigrant associations \[ **E1**, p5\-26\]. The results proved vital for operational planning, convincing T3M that effective engagement with grassroots supporters, including its 40,000 strong forum membership, is critical to their continued success. T3M confirmed how the report ‘ *revealed the importance of local\-level participation beyond our usual strongholds of London and Bristol*’, necessitating increased ‘ *grassroot buy\-in*’ \[ **E1**, p3\]. Bueltmann’s historical insights were thus reinforced by the survey, convincing T3M to understand the need to link immigrant groups across regions and to build higher levels of public participation into their activities. 

 In response to the outlined findings, T3M reconceived the scope and purpose of their planned ‘This is Our Home’ tour, launched in March 2020. Originally intended as simply a publicity tour, T3M confirmed that ‘ *in a significant departure from what was originally envisaged, the revised tour placed a greater emphasis on strong grassroots and local engagement’* \[ **E1**, p3\] *.* Planned information events for example, were developed into grassroots engagement workshops, such as the popular ‘Euro Cafes’ \[ **E1**, p3; **E3**, p9\]. Scheduled to run until May 2020, the tour was curtailed due to the Covid19 lockdown, but it still reached cities in all four UK nations. This success allowed T3M to build closer links with its membership, engage with local councils and representatives from devolved administrations, and host vital public information sessions \[ **E3**, **E4**\]. The tour offered T3M ‘ *unprecedented insights into the national picture of our movement, supporters and grassroots’* and was *‘an eye\-opener’* in terms of what ‘ *a more locally\-focused model’* can achieve \[ **E1**, p3\]. 

 **4.3 Enhanced T3M’s Effectiveness as an Advocacy Body ** 

 Bueltmann’s historical research directly benefited T3M’s advocacy work and ability to influence policy development at Westminster. T3M noted how it ‘ *allowed us to underpin our lobbying activities with a substantial body of evidence …supporting our fundamental campaigning and policy objectives’* \[ **E1**, p2\]. 

 The EUSS report was launched at an event hosted by the Foreign Press Association and received extensive media coverage \[ **E1**, p2; **E5**\]. Lord Greaves \(Liberal Democrat peer\), cited the report in the House of Lords, emphasising the detailed work of Bueltmann and the ‘ *phenomenal response rate’*, which he hoped would inform deliberations in relation to the EU withdrawal agreement \[ **E6**, p4\]. Similarly, the Home Affairs Select Committee made a formal request for clarification from the Government by directly referencing the *‘report published by the3million and Northumbria University…which found that nearly 90% of EU citizens surveyed were unhappy with receiving only a digital status* \[rather than physical documentation\]’ \[ **E7**, p2\]. On the strength of the report, T3M were invited to give oral evidence to the Future Relationship with the EU Commons Select Committee \(7 July 2020\), further cementing their position as recognised experts concerning the issue of EU Citizens rights \[ **E8**, 10:10min\]. 

 Working with Bueltmann also enabled T3M ‘ *to reach an entirely new audience and more diverse political stakeholders’* \[ **E1**, p2\], including the Friedrich\-Ebert\-Stiftung \(FES\), an internationally recognised Social Democratic thinktank. Bueltmann prepared several policy briefs for the FES and its stakeholders, including its ‘Endangered Rights’ policy brochure \(2018: 5,000\+ downloads\). This facilitated policy discussions with key political stakeholders, regarding the adoption of T3M’s recommended ‘Citizens’ Rights Protocol’. As the FES Director explained, Bueltmann *‘has supported us a great deal in explaining these relevant political issues to our stakeholders in the UK and Germany and helped raise the political awareness in both countries*’ \[ **E9**\]. Similarly, T3M’s policy agenda informed Bueltmann’s discussions with the Europe Minister of the State of Lower Saxony \(February 2019\), and a delegation of state MPs from the Berlin Senate \(April 2019\) \[ **E9**\]. Just as the diasporic associations of the past sought to protect their interests across national lines, so too has Bueltmann’s partnership with T3M resulted in a deeper engagement with its membership and extended its reach as their advocate.

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Creative Works London \(CWL\) was an AHRC\-funded Knowledge Exchange Hub for the Creative Economy with 43 HEI and creative\-economy partners. It was led by Queen Mary University of London and directed first by Professor Welch and then by Professor Shiach. The vast majority of creative\-economy businesses are microenterprises, and thus have limited internal resources to invest in testing new ways of working, creating new products, building new markets and audiences, or shaping cultural policies that would increase their sustainability. The creative economy also lacks diversity compared to other economic sectors. For example, participation by women in the workforce is only 37%, compared to 47% across the economy as a whole. CWL’s research and knowledge exchange activities responded to these pressing issues: 

-  enhanced financial sustainability of micro and small businesses in London’s creative economy 

-  enabled significant innovations within creative businesses, through co\-created research 

-  contributed to policy development related to Creative Hubs, including internationally 

-  promoted the role of women in leadership positions within London’s creative economy. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 CWL’s research was led by the two PIs, Welch and Shiach, and built on theories and methods developed within the field of English Studies, particularly in relation to the analysis of creative practice; cultural history and theory; gender and sexuality; and the modalities of creative work. 

 Some research underpinning CWL’s impact took place within the GBP4,900,000 AHRC\-funded and Queen Mary\-led programme ‘Beyond Text’, whose partners included theatre, dance, and film companies; museums and galleries; small creative businesses; and schools \(Welch PI, 2007\-12\) \[3.1\]. Findings from ‘Beyond Text’ included an enhanced understanding of the relationships between cultural practice and identity; new approaches to capturing ephemeral performances; and evidence for the barriers between Arts and Humanities researchers and emerging digital industries. These findings shaped the three research strands established within CWL: \(i\) Place/Work/Knowledge; \(ii\) Capturing London’s Audiences; and \(iii\) London’s Digital Economy.  Each of these strands was led by a CWL co\-investigator and also supported by a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in Queen Mary’s English Department. Shiach’s substantial body of research on cultural history and labour, and more recent work on immaterial labour and precarity, contributed to the identification of the insecurity of creative businesses and creative work as key research areas, and the amelioration of these as key aims for CWL \[3.2, 3.3\]. 

 Two further projects exemplify the interdisciplinary research approaches that led to the achievement of CWL’s aims. Researchers involved in both projects were all from Queen Mary. 

 ‘Peopling the Ragged School’ co\-created research with the Ragged School Museum \(RSM\), East London to develop a permanent gallery display with a linked set of educational resources for schools, representing the importance of the Ragged School movement in the history of Victorian philanthropy \[3.4\]. This project focussed on the surviving admissions books for Dr Barnardo’s Copperfield Road Free School, on which the RSM is based. The research team included Peter Mitchell \(English\) and Alastair Owens \(Geography/CWL CI\). Tessa Whitehouse \(English\) contributed research on childhood and cultures of dissent. 

 Beatwoven® is a creative business established by a weaver who interprets sound and music into pixelated patterns and designs that can be woven into fabrics. Two research collaborations between Beatwoven® and Queen Mary \(Andrew Robertson/Digital Music and Noam Shemtov/IP Law\) investigated both legal and technical issues that were important for the future growth of Beatwoven®. The collaborations allowed development of the coding necessary to create an app for customers to upload their own music and create their own patterns. The research undertaken on IP rights in relation to an emerging technology clarified the legal position of the composers and of the weaver herself. 

 Specific tools and frameworks for collaboration were developed by CWL. Research Labs and Ideas Pools involved CWL researchers, creative businesses and creative entrepreneurs and facilitated identification of pressing issues for the creative economy. These pressing issues included the role of creative hubs within the creative economy; the use of digital content to build audiences; the potential of the hackathon as an innovation tool; the nature and impact of London’s digital ecologies of collaboration; the changing audience experience of London’s museums; and the key function of ‘knowledge intermediaries’ in university/creative economy collaborations. CWL engaged with 445 businesses and supported 26,240 hours of collaborative research. Such co\-creation of research was enabled through five tools developed by and implemented within the project: 

-  Creative Vouchers supported a creative business to work with a researcher for 3\-6 months; 

-  Researchers\-in\-Residence enabled an early\-career researcher to be embedded within a business and undertake a programme of research identified by that business as high priority; 

-  Creative\-Entrepreneurs\-in\-Residence: creative entrepreneur accessed research expertise and specialist facilities within partner research organisations; 

-  BOOST: ‘follow\-on’ funding enabled development and/or commercialization of findings; 

-  Fusion Collaborative Awards provided innovation vouchers for creative and digital businesses to access appropriate research expertise. 

 The research underpinning CWL’s impact also took place within the context of two closely related projects. Firstly, the AHRC/GCRF follow\-on project for impact and engagement, Creativeworks London/São Paulo, in partnership with the University of São Paulo, researched the characteristics of Creative Hubs within São Paulo, identifying the economically and culturally inhibiting effects of the stark distinctions between ‘cultural’ Hubs and ‘innovation’ Hubs. It also undertook co\-created research with creative businesses and supported the development of new business models to enhance sustainability \[3.5\] **.** Secondly, the ERDF\-funded project, London Creative and Digital Fusion, \(2012\-14\) allowed CWL to lead London Fusion’s innovation voucher programme and its Researcher\-in\-Residence programme. Comparative research was undertaken on CWL’s Creative Vouchers and Fusion’s Collaborative Awards to advance understanding of knowledge exchange methodologies \[3.6\]. 

 The Culture Capital Exchange, CWL’s delivery partner, ensured that CWL’s research prioritised the needs of creative economy businesses in London. Key findings from these knowledge\-exchange activities were understanding the role of networks in enabling and sustaining innovation in the creative economy; the centrality of translation between different collaborative languages in enabling productive dialogues between researchers and SMEs; and the role of knowledge intermediaries in sustaining successful co\-created research projects \[3.6\].

#  4. Details of the impact: 

#  Enhanced financial sustainability of micro and small businesses and cultural organisations within London’s creative economy 

 CWL enhanced the economic performance of the micro and small businesses with which it collaborated. Measurable impacts included the creation of spinout companies and new jobs and increases in gross value added \(GVA\). These economic impacts \[5.4, 5.5\] and were audited by the AHRC and the GLA as part of the formal end\-of\-project evaluation processes for CWL and London Fusion. 

| Number of spinouts following collaboration with CWL | 14 |
| --- | --- |
| Number of jobs created following collaboration with CWL and Fusion | 22 |
| Gross Value Added for businesses supported by a Fusion Collaborative Award | EUR2,700,000 |

 CWL’s co\-created research with the Ragged School Museum \(RSM\) supported the development of a permanent gallery display. The Museum Director \[5.7\] confirmed that the collaboration ‘enabled the Museum to make a shift in focus to investigating our own history, which was vital in making an application to the Heritage Lottery Fund’ \[EQR.3.1\]. The Director further confirmed that ‘the project outputs have greatly improved what we offer our visitors,’ and this will be ‘a key element of the RSM’s future funding strategy, which will transform facilities and expand the RSM’s programme. With all of the building in productive use the Museum will become financially self\-sufficient.’ RSM Trustees’ Report to the Charity Commission indicates that the Museum’s income doubled between 2014/15 \(when the CWL\-funded research took place\) and 2018/19. 

#  Produced Innovations within creative businesses through co\-created research 

 CWL’s research collaborations with creative businesses contributed to the development of new products, new service formats, new business models, and technological innovations \[5.4\]. In 2016, collaborating businesses reported the following as directly related to their work with CWL: 

| New or distinctive products or designs | 32 |
| --- | --- |
| New Service formats or other delivery mechanisms | 57 |
| New business processes within a partner creative\-economy business | 18 |
| New apps or other software | 9 |

 As a result of the collaborative research enabled both by a CWL creative voucher and by collaboration within the BOOST programme, Beatwoven® was able to develop a new and robust business model. The company diversified its outputs to include artworks as well as fashion textiles, and received commissions from clients including the Southbank Centre, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Harrods. The Founder \[5.10\] also reported in 2017 that the company had ‘partnered with Firetech, Warner Music UK’s innovation lab, and the Bowie Estate, to create a piece of woven art translated from Bowie’s song “Let’s Dance.”’  BOOST was cited as an important financial model by an EU Expert Committee \[5.8, p.25\]. 

#  Enhanced evidence\-based policy related to the role of Creative Hubs, nationally and internationally 

 CWL’s research on Creative Hubs identified their role in enabling sustainable creative work and supporting creative businesses in London. A CWL Research Lab on ‘Coming to Terms with Creative Hubs,’ co\-convened with Knowledge London and the Higher Education Entrepreneurship Group in 2016, led to the development of an enhanced case for public and private investment in Creative Hubs. Consultancy projects undertaken by Shiach and Virani increased the impacts of this research. For example, Virani was funded by the Greater London Authority \(GLA\) to produce policy recommendations related to ‘Community Engagement, Micro Communities, Small Businesses and Effective Local Policy,’ which would inform the regeneration of Chrisp Street Market in East London. In 2018, building on CWL’s research, Queen Mary launched Network: The Queen Mary Centre for the Creative and Cultural Economy \(directed by Shiach & Virani\)  [https://networkcentre.uk](https://networkcentre.uk/), which has undertaken policy\-focussed consultancy, including Development of a Self\-Assessment Evaluation Framework for Creative Hubs in Thailand \(with the British Council\) and Mapping the Creative Economy in West Bengal \(with the British Council, Government of West Bengal, and the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur\). Shiach and Virani also undertook research on Creative Clusters, Social Inclusion, and Sustainability: The Case of Hackney Wick and Fish Island \(HWFI\), which formed part of the successful bid to the Mayor of London for designation of HWFI as a ‘Creative Enterprise Zone’ \(CEZ\). The role of a CEZ is ‘to protect the creative sector in the capital, increase affordable spaces for artists and entrepreneurs, and boost job and training opportunities for local people’ \( [<ins>https://www.london.gov.uk/press\-releases/mayoral/mayor\-announces\-first\-creative\-enterprise\-zones</ins>](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-announces-first-creative-enterprise-zones)\). 

 ‘Creative Hubs and Urban Development Goals, UK/Brazil’ \(colloquially known as Creativeworks London/São Paulo\) produced a Policy Report for the State Government of São Paulo \[5.6\], outlining the potential contributions of Creative Hubs in the city of São Paulo to economic development and the negative consequences of the stark dichotomy between ‘cultural’ and ‘innovation’ Hubs existing within the city. The research team was then invited to present its findings to senior government representatives. In light of this, the government subsequently invested in three new Creative Hub spaces in 2018. 

#  Promoted the roles of women in leadership positions within London’s creative economy. 

 The CWL Women in the Digital Culture and Economy Network promoted both participation by female digital entrepreneurs in CWL and a good gender balance in applications to its funded schemes. CWL worked in partnership with the V&A’s Digital Programmes team, the Knowledge Transfer Network, Innovate UK, and the Digital Catapult. As a result, 63% of the research collaborations funded by Creative Vouchers involved female\-led creative businesses, and 60% of these projects had female research partners. More than 50% of the entrepreneurs funded by the Creative\-Entrepreneur\-in\-Residence schemes were female. This prepared a significant number of female\-led creative businesses to apply successfully for further investment and funding and to increase their profiles for innovation.  Female creative entrepreneurs funded by CWL include the European Woman Innovator of the Year, 2017; a Finalist in the Inventor of the Year Award Competition run by the InclusiveTechAlliance, 2019; and the Co\-Founder of New Media Networks who wrote in 2016 that ‘Following the CWL\-funded project I was appointed as a Non\-Executive Director for Communication and Information on the UK National Commission for UNESCO. This led me to working on policies for UNESCO \[and\] also to presenting at the UNESCO General Conference… Thank you CWL for providing the opportunity to help to make any of this happen’ \[5.9\]. The Co\-CEO of Unruly Media says that ‘These ground\-breaking collaborations have been tremendously useful for innovation\-led businesses within the creative economy, and it was great to see CWL working with so many female\-led SMEs and female creative entrepreneurs.’

A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy and with enabling more socially responsible corporate practices.",17.47,16.36,47.04,26.03,-15.64,24.17,48,23,262,89,96,0,306,121,39,7,0.1911525974025974,0.2168837018837018,0.2692307692307692,0.2188837920489297,0.3197860962566845,0.225450435640309,1142

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A major obstacle to advancement in space exploration is the lack of solar power due to distance from the Sun. This significantly impedes deep space and planetary missions. Engineering researchers at the University of Leicester have played a critical role in a multidisciplinary programme that has transformed spacecraft power and thermal control by pioneering novel americium\-based Radioisotope Heater Units \(RHUs\) and Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators \(RTGs\). The impact has enabled exploration of previously inaccessible regions of space, had economic impact by creating new international export markets and job creation, led to policy and practice changes, and positive environmental impact by developing energy harvesting technologies and reducing the environmental cost of nuclear power.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2013, Engineering researchers Williams and Weston at the University Leicester \(UoL\) commenced interdisciplinary research with Ambrosi \(Physics and Astronomy at UoL\) to develop radioisotope power systems fuelled by americium\-241 \(<sup>241</sup>Am\). Prior physics work by Ambrosi at the University of Leicester had succeeded in demonstrating the viability of <sup>241</sup>Am as an alternative to plutonium\-238 \(<sup>238</sup>Pu\). Whilst <sup>238</sup>Pu is in short supply globally, <sup>241</sup>Am can be extracted from transuranic waste \(a waste product of civilian nuclear power generation\) long considered useless. However, huge engineering challenges existed in the development of successful <sup>241</sup>Am\-fuelled systems. Between 2013 and 2019, Williams’s engineering expertise and Weston’s materials chemistry \(with critical support from team members Watkinson, Mesalam and Barco\) were used to lead on crucial engineering materials and system performance advances that proved integral to this highly successful interdisciplinary programme **\[R1–R5\]**. 

 In the UK, nuclear power generation produces around 6 tonnes of plutonium by\-product every year. By 2019, over 140 tonnes were stored at the Sellafield site, dating back over 40 years. Building on the successful identification of <sup>241</sup>Am as a fuel source, from 2013 the Leicester team collaborated with the National Nuclear Laboratory to establish a trial production line for <sup>241</sup>Am extraction using a non\-radioactive surrogate **\[G1\]**. Alongside this work, the researchers turned their attention to the problem of safety containment, driving forward with new research into space nuclear fuel development **\[R1–R3\]**. 

 Utilising a Metal Matrix Composite \(MMC\), Williams’s team was able to improve the integrity of the brittle ceramic\-based fuel. They used spark plasma sintering \(SPS\) to successfully produce Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\-niobium MMCs **\[R1\]**. This use of Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a non\-radioactive surrogate for Am<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramic, pioneered by Watkinson under Williams and Weston’s supervision, led directly to the novel discovery in 2017 that mixed Nd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CeO<sub>2</sub> ceramics could be surrogates for the chemical production of the radioactive fuel **\[R2\]**. This allowed the first demonstration of appropriate sintering parameters to achieve the required density of 85\-90% with minimal additional handling of the fuel whilst in powder form – a significant benefit for nuclear safety – and selecting cold\-press sintering as the preferred method **\[R3\].** These developments were critical in enabling the production of <sup>241</sup>Am\-oxide ceramic fuel required for space energy projects. 

 From 2015, ESA funded development of a <sup>241</sup>Am Radioisotope Heater Unit \(RHU\) design **\[G2\]**. As PI, Williams produced a specification and design based on the novel fuel work, which included a safety containment system of platinum\-based alloys, carbon\-bonded\-carbon\-fibre insulation and carbon\-carbon composites. 

 In parallel with the fuels and RHU work, the Leicester team began collaborations with both industrial and government partners to develop the first working prototype <sup>241</sup>Am Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator \(RTG\) system. Williams focused on the overall system performance and in particular the thermoelectric materials that provide the critical conversion of thermal to electrical energy. His team mechanically strengthened the thermoelectric materials by the novel addition of boron carbide **\[R4\]**. Mesalam, under Williams’s supervision, developed an impedance spectroscopy method to measure thermoelectric performance and diagnose manufacturing and service defects **\[R5\]** and used it to show that the novel thermoelectric materials were sufficiently radiation resistant for missions exceeding 10 years **\[R6\]**. Weston’s electrochemistry expertise and laboratory facilities were critical to this work. 

 With Leicester leading and directing the overall RTG development project alongside Airbus UK, Lockheed Martin and the National Nuclear Laboratory, delivery of a fully functional <sup>241</sup>Am RTG to ESA in 2018 capable of providing 200 W of heat and 10 W of electrical power was achieved. The novel material and measurement methods developed by Williams’s team are now a standard feature of future RTG designs and critical to the future production and launch safety of such systems **\[R7\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The University of Leicester is a global leader in the development of space nuclear power systems for electrical power generation, spacecraft heating and thermal management in the form of Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators \(RTGs\) and Radioisotope Heater Units \(RHUs\). 

 **Enabling Space Exploration** 

 Prior to UoL intervention, independent European access to Radioisotope Power Systems \(RPS\) for space applications was not possible. These sources utilised <sup>238</sup>Pu as fuel, which is both scarce and costly. RPS is a crucial enabling technology for deep space and planetary missions. The contributions led by Engineering colleagues in materials and system performance were critical in determining the feasibility of <sup>241</sup>Am as an alternative to <sup>238</sup>Pu fuel. This has enabled independent development of RPS by ESA capable of powering future space ‘ *missions to the distant solar system for 400 years, while also addressing a long\-term concern of the UK's nuclear industry*’ **\[E1a\].** ESA have confirmed that the baseline radioisotope fuel considered for use in European Space RPS is **firmly established** to be <sup>241</sup>Am, in the form of sintered ceramic pellets **\[G2\].** RTGs/RHUs based on UoL research are baselined for the European Large Logistics Lander EL3 \(2026/27\) and proposed by the European science community for ESA missions to Uranus and Neptune in the next decade. Without methodologies and technologies created at Leicester, none of these missions is possible **\[E2a, E2b, E2c\].** 

 As a result of these demonstrable benefits, the 2018 ‘UK\-US Nuclear R&D Action Plan’ includes provision of explicit cooperation on the development of ‘ *Radioisotopes for use in space technologies’*, ‘ *Nuclear Reactor Technologies*’ and ‘ *Advanced Fuels*’: objectives significantly influenced by UoL research **\[E3\].** 

 **Environmental Impact** 

 The UK civilian nuclear power programme has generated over 140 tonnes of reprocessed civil plutonium fuel, currently stored at Sellafield. The utilisation of this reprocessed fuel in future generations of nuclear reactors will play a significant role in decarbonising the economy. Plutonium use in nuclear power plants is facilitated by the extraction of minor actinides or contaminants such as <sup>241</sup>Am which build up in the reprocessed fuel. The UoL team’s research into the fuel form and its consolidation into pellets—in collaboration with the National Nuclear Laboratory \(NNL\)—as well as leadership of system level design, containment and heat conversion technologies in RTGs, demonstrated the utility of <sup>241</sup>Am for space applications. The UoL research incentivises ‘cleaning’ the plutonium for space applications while providing a fuel for use in terrestrial nuclear power plants. The <sup>241</sup>Am can also be utilised in applications beyond space including oil well logging, smoke alarms, neutron sources and terrestrial power systems in challenging environments **\[E3, E4\]**. 

 The importance of the ability to utilise nuclear waste practically \(using technologies like RHUs and RTGs developed by the UoL team\) has been widely recognised, with the UK Minister for Science describing it as a ‘ *remarkable breakthrough*’ highlighting the nation’s position ‘ *at the very frontier of developments in space technology*.’ **\[E5\]**. The discovery won the Collaborate to Innovate Award for Aerospace and Defence in 2019 **\[E1a, E5\]** and finalist places in two categories of the IChemE Global Awards 2020: Energy and Innovative Product **\[E1c\].** 

 **Economic Impact** 

 The UoL research has already provided substantial economic benefits across the world. Direct collaboration between UoL and European Thermodynamics Ltd \(ETL\) has resulted in the development of full end\-to\-end RTG capability and the utilisation of automated production methods for the manufacture of thermoelectric modules and new energy harvesting products. ETL have incorporated these developments into their core business and product lines for terrestrial customers and low\-carbon technology markets. This has both retained and created high\-skilled jobs. For example, their “ *Adaptive<sup>®</sup> brand of thermoelectric generator modules \(TEG5\) . . . has resulted in volume sales of \[GBP\]150,000 p.a*.” **\[E6\]**. The products enabled by ETL collaboration and research engagement with UoL are projected to provide them *“\[GBP\]5,000,000 per year by 2030”* **\[E6\]**. 

 Similarly, partnership with the NNL *“has directly resulted in the creation of new export markets for Americium sealed heat sources for space nuclear power with both ESA and South Korea”* \(as of 2019\) **\[E4\]**. Between 2021 and 2026, *“the economic value in sales alone is estimated to be more than* \[GBP\] *50,000,000”* **\[E4\]**. 

 A 2018 London Economics report **\[E7\]** on the space sector provides evidence of the economic impact of ESA investments in the UK. This study outlines that the GVA of the investment adds an additional GBP11,500,000 to the GBP12,000,000 invested by ESA. This programme has created and retained skilled jobs in the space and nuclear sectors. Applying an assessment of the GVA on jobs multiplier, this programme sustains an additional 30 people in supply chain and other sectors. A recent study by UKSA on the impact of investment in the ESA science programme *“found that GBP523,000,000 of UK Space Agency funding put into the European Space Agency's Space Science Programme \(SSP\) has generated \[GBP\]1,400,000,000 of income for UK industry, with a further GBP1,100,000,000 from partially attributed and forecast benefit”* **\[E8\]**. This presents a maximum 4.8 to 1 multiplication effect. Thus, the research has a gross value\-added factor of around GBP50,000,000 of impact based on the GBP11,000,000 investment **\[E8\]**. 

 **Policy** 

 The pioneering work of the UoL programme, including the underpinning research conducted in Engineering and close collaboration with NNL, has resulted directly in a series of policy decisions by the UK Government to continue to invest in this programme at the 2012, 2016 and 2019 ESA Council of Ministers meetings **\[E2a, E2b\]**. UoL is the global focal point for Americium\-based radioisotope power system development. The underpinning engineering research was a critical enabler for this. France is now playing a significant role in the ESA programme **\[E2c\]**, and there is greater collaboration between the US and UK through the UK\-US Nuclear R&D Action Plan \(September 2018\) **\[E3\]**. The latter includes the area of cooperation: “ *Radioisotopes for use in space technologies”*. The Memorandum of Understanding signed \(June 2019\) between the UoL, NNL and Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute \(KAERI\) was brokered directly by UoL and pledges new areas of cooperation on research on radioisotope thermoelectric power generators for use in space exploration and commits the signatories to developing international standards and safety associated with these space systems **\[E9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at the University of Leeds European Centre for the Responsibility to Protect \(ECR2P\) has changed policies on mass atrocity prevention at the United Nations \(UN\), informed United Kingdom \(UK\) government policy, and contributed evidence and capacity in the wider policy community. It changed UN policy on the inclusion of partners from the Global South, altering UN strategies to enhance the legitimacy and practice of the R2P prevention and protection agendas. ECR2P research also influenced the mainstreaming of R2P mass atrocity considerations into the UK’s foreign policy and its promotion of stabilisation rather than intervention. ECR2P collective research provided new evidence\-bases for a wide range of UK organisations, including NGOs and select committees, changing understandings on how to create more effective atrocity responses. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Responsibility to Protect \(R2P\) ‘embodies a political commitment to end the worst forms of violence and persecution’ \( [UN](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/about-responsibility-to-protect.shtml)\). Amidst the resurgence of violent conflict there has been significant increase in atrocity crimes \(genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing\) as evidenced by the fact that of the 81 UN Security Council Resolutions that invoke the R2P, 77 of them occurred since 2011. ECR2P aims to reduce atrocity harm and risk by providing research\-based evidence to states and international organisations in their efforts to protect populations from mass atrocities. Launched in 2016, the year the World Bank reported that more countries experienced violent conflict than at any time in nearly 30 years, it is the only European centre on R2P and is a leading research and advisory group, from which the impact outlined in this case study arose.  ECR2P is distinguished from the two other global R2P centres \(Global Centre for R2P, Asia\-Pacific Centre for R2P\) by its pragmatic policy reform approach, which seeks to critically address and then locate often overlooked policy alterations that can bring about incremental and realisable reform to mass atrocity prevention policy. Comprising six staff and six PGR members from POLIS, the ECR2P operates an active engagement policy via problem\-focused research, consultancy, fieldwork partnerships, public engagement, and informing policy and practice at the UN, European and UK levels. This includes active evidence\-generating links with the UN Office for Genocide Prevention and R2P, and several key organisations in the UK and EU working on human protection and atrocity prevention. Three key research activities underpin the impact below. 

 1\) Research conducted by ECR2P staff pertaining to UN processes and thinking on R2P and atrocity prevention strategies has argued for broadening the consultative processes shaping UN member\-state policies and perceptions of R2P, contributing empirical evidence towards better legitimating R2P policy development. For example, Stefan’s research argued for an increased role for non\-permanent UN Security Council \(UNSC\) members and for the inclusion of alternative R2P views, such as those of Brazil and others in the Global South, to consolidate R2P legitimacy and support **\[1\]**. Similarly, Ralph’s and Gallagher’s research on UNSC competence **\[3,6\]** and Stefan’s collaborative research for the UN **\[2\]** stressed legitimacy concerns triggered by the limited implementation of R2P through Security\-Council decision\-making and the ‘use of force’ component of R2P. Ralph’s research on the role the UK plays in the UNSC also highlights legitimacy challenges for R2P moving forward post\-Brexit **\[6\]**. Stefan’s first\-of\-a\-kind study on ‘Lessons Learnt from Guinea’ **\[2\]** demonstrated that a specific combination of preventative, diplomatic, political and juridical tools could be employed at the UN when risk factors of the type seen in post\-election Guinea are noticed elsewhere. 

 2\) ECR2P research has collectively examined the need for states to better mainstream atrocity prevention into foreign policy ‘stabilisation’ efforts and to ensure respect for international humanitarian and human rights law within the main tenets of R2P implementation **\[1,2\]**, especially when applying the R2P framework to specific case studies, such as Libya and Syria **\[3\-6\]**. In particular, Ralph’s research into UK government approaches to atrocity prevention provided concrete suggestions for mainstreaming R2P into UK foreign policy, demonstrating that the UK government needed to adjust its conflict analysis processes, clarify its position on R2P ‘focal points’, re\-write its stabilisation policies to prioritize atrocity prevention **\[5\]**, and redesign its role within the UN Security Council **\[6\]** in a post\-Brexit context **\[7\]**. Similarly, Stefan’s research stresses the importance of identifying non\-military tools available to operationalize R2P **\[1\]**, derived from successful preventative examples of R2P **\[2\]**, which has also informed ECR2P training of military personnel in Doha, Qatar. 

 3\) ECR2P research provided insights on ongoing R2P\-related developments in Libya **\[1,3\]**, Syria **\[3,4,6\]** and other mass atrocity situations **\[2,4,6\]**, which informed the presentation of evidence to a number of UK select committees and UK\-based institutions working on protection, prevention, and R2P. The insights stem from a body of research providing acute analysis on how, when, and under what circumstances, military intervention may play a role in the operationalisation of the R2P. This includes investigating complex and ongoing challenges associated with mass atrocity in Libya and Syria **\[3,4\]**, and what effective response parameters are available within the R2P framework and international law **\[1\-3,6\]**.

 ECR2P research is shaping the development of R2P policy in three significant ways: i\) by the Centre becoming an evidence\-generating knowledge hub changing policy understandings within the wider R2P policy community through global intellectual leadership; ii\) setting the agenda and changing policy at the UN, and iii\) shaping UK policy on mainstreaming R2P and atrocity prevention. 

 **i\) ECR2P has become an evidence\-generating knowledge hub changing stakeholder understanding, strategies and policies for preventing mass atrocity**. Since 2016, the scope of policy engagement and influence by ECR2P is illustrated by repeated invitations to its members to contribute written and oral research evidence to the UK Defence Select Committee and Foreign Affairs Select Committees and through directly influencing the work of NGOs and charitable organisations in the UK, such as the United Nations Association UK \(UNA\-UK\) and Protection Approaches **\[A,B\]**, which are the two flagship UK organisations working on protection, prevention of atrocities and R2P, and who are now affiliated partners with ECR2P \(see **iii\)** below\). As just one set of examples, Gallagher presented research with follow\-up oral evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee on Iraq and Syria and threats posed by ISIS in October 2014. Gallagher’s evidence\-base was cited in the CDC report on ISIS in Iraq and Syria \(p. 16\) and provided influential recommendations on the legality of airstrikes in Iraq and Syria **\[C\]**. A former MP and Defence Committee member remarks: ‘ *Dr Gallagher played a key role in shaping the Committee’s understanding of this topic which is reflected in the fact that the final report cites his evidence \[which\] helped the Committee differentiate between legal and illegal action under the Responsibility to Protect framework’* **\[D\]**. In addition, Gallagher was invited to give written evidence on ‘The Extent and Effectiveness of Post\-Conflict Planning in Libya’ to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which was cited in its final report \(2016\-17, pp. 26\-27\) **\[E\]**. Written evidence from Gallagher and Ralph provided post\-Brexit strategy recommendations to a 2018 Foreign Affairs Select Committee on ‘Global Britain: R2P and Humanitarian Intervention’ \(Report, pp. 6, 8, 10\) **\[F\]**. In non\-governmental settings, ECR2P has directly influenced The UK Working Group on Atrocity Prevention, an umbrella group which includes all UK organisations focusing on reducing the risk of mass atrocities worldwide and on influencing the UK government policy on the topic. This UK Working Group has drawn upon ECR2P’s research expertise and findings **\[5\]** to inform about which R2P policies to lobby the UK government **\[A,B\]**, specifically within a post\-Brexit context. 

 **ii\) Directly influencing and shaping UN agenda on R2P and atrocity prevention** through formal partnership agreements and consultancies to the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and the R2P. As detailed below, these activities include the development of policy to change the UN Office’s consultancy process with UN Member States, direct contributions towards redefining the strategic priorities of the UN Joint Office, drafting contributions to the UN Secretary\-General’s Annual Report on R2P, and providing analysis and research\-based critical evidence synthesis to shape the development of prevention\-oriented policy through the UN’s Atrocity Prevention Assessment project **\[G,H\]**. 

 One of Stefan’s research contributions highlights the importance of including states from the Global South in designing R2P\-related responses at the UN **\[1\]**. This is critical, because while most atrocity prevention efforts occur in the Global South, states from these regions are often absent from policy design and decision\-making at the UN, thereby undermining both the legitimacy and efficacy of R2P interventions. Her analysis was used during the organisation of preliminary discussions running up to the drafting of the Secretary\-General’s Annual Report on the R2P, during Stefan’s secondment to the UN in May\-June 2017. It was during this secondment that Stefan’s recommendation to broaden inclusion of regional powers like Brazil within preliminary UN discussions was adopted by the UN Office. The former UN Special Advisor to the Secretary\-General on R2P remarks: ‘ *Dr. Stefan’s research on legitimating R2P processes within the UN, and the need to include emerging powers such as Brazil, has made us reconsider the role of Member States from the Global South and to change the way we invite and encourage these actors to participate in R2P related processes and decision\-making. This change in policy has been a crucial first step towards making the R2P more inclusive, and more representative of regional perspectives, thus increasing R2P’s legitimacy*’ **\[G\]**. This inclusion ‘ *has* *directly changed the way the UN Office engages with the policy preferences from the Global South*’ and provided strategic opportunities for R2P advancement in terms of increased legitimacy and support **\[G\]**. 

 Stefan was asked by the R2P Special Advisor to the Secretary General to contribute written text to the 2017 UN Secretary\-General’s report on *‘*Implementing the Responsibility to Protect: Accountability for Prevention’, which acknowledges the regional potential towards the prevention of atrocities **\[G\]**. Stefan’s research\-based evidence **\[1,2\]** informed the *2017 UN Report on R2P* to stress the relationship between legitimate processes, Security Council processes, and the need for collaborative work, with Stefan being *‘the first to propose including a section on the important role played by regional players, to highlight the need for collaborative efforts to address atrocities effectively* … *In the longer term, this will lead to much greater legitimacy in the UN’s operationalization of R2P’* **\[G\]**. The final report was submitted to the Secretary\-General and his executive office. Stefan was also consulted by *Strategy for Humanity,* an organisation commissioned to conduct a strategic review of the priorities of the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and R2P in 2016. The former Head of the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and R2P affirms that Stefan’s ‘ *recommendations pertaining to strategic priorities for the Responsibility to Protect agenda at the United Nations contributed to the subsequent recalibration of the Joint Office’s strategy and priorities’* **\[H\]**. 

 As a result of Stefan shaping UN thinking on inclusionary R2P practices, the UN Special Advisor on R2P invited her to contribute to a new Atrocity Prevention Assessment project, designed to inform the United Nations’ overall policy on atrocity prevention **\[G,H\]**. The project’s *‘final report is shaping UN’s policy on atrocity prevention, being the first comprehensive UN assessment of prevention risk factors’* **\[G\]**. Stefan’s research on Guinea **\[2\]** was one of seven cases informing the Atrocity Prevention Assessment project **\[G,H\]**, and *‘supplied an evidence\-base for \[UN Office\] prevention analysis and identified the combination of effective preventive tools used in Guinea, which the UN could replicate elsewhere under similar conditions and in collaborations with regional and national actors’* **\[H\]**. The prevention measures that Stefan identified *‘provided useful examples to inform our \[UN Joint Office\] overall prevention assessment and further recommendations, \[which\] aimed to facilitate practical implementation’* **\[H\]**. From Stefan’s research findings, *‘the UN Joint Office was able to incorporate the evidence into the final assessment, which made a significant contribution to \[UN Office\] overall thinking and prevention strategy’* **\[G\]**. The overall assessment *‘produced lessons learned to advance atrocity prevention and to improve cost effectiveness* ... *The project also provided practical implementation advice for the United Nations Secretary\-General’s overall prevention vision’* **\[G\]**. 

 **iii\) Influencing UK policy on R2P and atrocity prevention** through formal partnership agreements, research collaborations, and the production of policy reports for key institutions working on prevention and protection in the UK. Ralph’s research on R2P in the UK context **\[3,5\]** has directly changed UK advocacy groups’ policy recommendations as well as their efforts to inform UK government policy in its effort to develop more effective strategies to prevent mass atrocities through the R2P **\[A,B\]**. The Director of Protection Approaches, one of the UK’s leading advocacy groups on ending identity\-based violence, states, *‘\[Ralph’s\] recommendations on how to integrate atrocity prevention into government practices significantly helped to shape our thinking on UK R2P mainstreaming, and we both incorporated its findings and cited the report in our own policy brief of May 2018, Towards a national approach to atrocities’* **\[5,B\]**. Similarly, the Head of Policy at UNA\-UK states that Ralph’s research *‘formed the centrepiece of our lobbying efforts in this area*’, and they invited him to write its briefing report on *Mainstreaming the Responsibility to Protect in UK Strategy* **\[5\]** and to co\-write a second report on ‘Global Britain’ **\[I\]**. The first report was presented in the UK Parliament in April 2014 and was made the focus for discussion at a one\-day practitioner workshop on the R2P hosted by the UNA\-UK at the British Academy. According to the Head of Policy for UNA\-UK, ‘ *it was through the publication of the report that we were able to get the government to clarify who the UK R2P Focal Point was’* **\[A\]**, designating Paul Arkwright as the first of several diplomats to hold this position – in\-line with Ralph’s recommendation to heighten the significance of the role **\[A\]**. Similarly, Ralph’s co\-authored report on R2P and Global Britain **\[I\]** was presented in the UK Parliament and to the House of Lords in February 2019. Following these engagements, in July 2019 the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Policy Paper on the UK’s Approach to Preventing Mass Atrocities **\[J\]** explained that *‘\[g\]iven that the majority of atrocities occur in and around conflict, the UK has dedicated significant resources to addressing crises and conflict by means of a comprehensive cross\-governmental response’* and also stressed the usefulness of the Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability assessment tool \(JACS\) for the identification of situation\-specific interventions, both of which were recommendations made in Ralph’s UNA\-UK report \( **\[5\]**, pp.14\-19; 26\-27\). As confirmed by the Head of Policy at UNA\-UK **\[A\]**: ‘ *The analysis and recommendations of the report formed the basis of subsequent UNA\-UK lobbying efforts on R2P, and these have, through the collective efforts of the Working Group \[on Atrocity Prevention\], helped to deliver change in UK policy.  In particular, and in response to the Foreign Affairs Committee’s recent call for a coherent and more precise strategy on atrocity prevention, Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmed promised to do more in this area*’. Likewise, the Head of Protection Approaches **\[B\]** writes: ‘ *Prof. Ralph’s underpinning research, combined with these efforts across civil society, has impressed upon the government the need for more systematic thinking in this area. The Foreign Secretary and Foreign Office Minister have stated publicly that they are committed to do more to prevent atrocity and government departments, including the Foreign Office and Stabilisation Unit, who are now reaching out to Protection Approaches and ECR2P for advice on how to change strategy and practices, including CSSF and JACS*’, a research recommendation of Ralph **\[5\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Trinity Laban’s research into dance health has changed practice within dance training and among dance educators and practitioners worldwide. We have seen a large growth in the body of scientific research concerning the physiological, biomechanical and psychological considerations of dance practice. Our research has examined the science of dancing, developed new models of practice for both those who train professionally, and those who participate recreationally, and has embraced and extended methodologies for evaluating the way in which dance improves health and wellbeing. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Trinity Laban is one of the pioneers of dance science as a field of teaching and research in the world. This research has raised consciousness of the importance of safe dance practice, dancer health and dance for health and has led to the development of new curricula in dance science in higher education, both in the UK and overseas. There are now many university and professional development courses and qualifications for teachers within the UK and internationally in the area of dance science and health. Importantly, our research has raised awareness of the necessity to apply scientific knowledge to dance training to prevent injury through practicing safely and effectively as well as spotlight the benefits of dance through nuanced more progressive methods of understanding those benefits among the wider population. 

 In the last decade, over 50 peer\-reviewed journal papers were published by Trinity Laban faculty and over 150 conference presentations delivered internationally, specifically focused on these topics. This underpinning research includes studies into the biopsychosocial contributing factors of injuries in contemporary and Irish dancers **\[R1\]**, the prevalence of injuries among over 800 young talented dancers **\[R4\]**, work\-load and energy intake and expenditure among vocational contemporary dance students **\[R2\]** and the cardiorespiratory fitness capacities of dancers alongside various experimental studies exploring the effect of supplementary strength and conditioning, new methods of warm\-up and balance training and recommendations for safer practising **\[R3\]**. 

 Our research into dance for health includes both experimental and ethnographic studies **\[R6\] \[R7\]** including those with physical and learning differences such as acquired brain injury and dementia **\[R8\]**. Research into optimal dance learning environments also sits within our portfolio of studies including papers on the role of the reflective practitioner within participatory arts practice. The research reveals a number of important findings. First, in relation to dancer training, discrepancies exist within the formal training of dancers, relating to debilitating habitual practices and injuries **\[R1\] \[R2\] \[R3\] \[R4\] \[R5\]**. This highlights a need for improved methods of training for enhancing and monitoring dancer health and educational resources for teachers so that every dancer’s potential is optimised. The research in this area, led by Professor Emma Redding, with groups of dance science researchers, post\-docs, and PhD students has included observational, cross\-sectional and experimental studies with over 1000 dancers including those from pre\-vocational, vocational\-conservatoire and professional populations. 

 Secondly, our research demonstrates the importance of facilitating learning environments that foster creativity and participant agency. Research has shown how creative practitioners have developed a range of diverse reflective practices to engage and nurture older participants which has important implications for understanding how we enhance participant experience **\[R6\].** Ethnographic and phenomenological research demonstrates the need for nuanced approaches to understanding participant experience **\[R7\].** Ethnographic methods also inform our search for alternative and more ethical ways to capturing and disseminating the active ingredient of dance in arts for health settings and employing dance to disseminate research findings.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact of our research includes new curricula and professional development in the area of dance and dance for health for dancers, teacher\-practitioners and a range of participatory arts activity that has brought about change. Trinity Laban’s Masters programmes \(MSc Dance Science and MFA Dance Science\) were the first degrees in dance science in the world. Trinity Laban continues to be both a pioneer and catalyst in this area. These programmes offer dancers and teachers a viable means to study issues around safe dance practice and dancer health. To date, over 250 people have graduated from Trinity Laban with an MSc or MFA in Dance Science, many of whom have gone on to create new modules and programmes in dance science and/or are lecturing at institutions nationally and internationally. Examples include: University of Bedfordshire, Bird College for Performing Arts, Canterbury Christchurch University, University of Chichester, Roehampton University, Bath Spa University, New Bucks University, University of Calgary, Canada, University of Bern, Germany, Texas A&M, Houston, USA **.** Our body of research continues to initiate consultancy with other HE institutions such as Rutgers University, USA to assist development of their new BFA Dance Science and Beijing Dance Academy, China to assist in the development of their new BA Dance Science programme. One international leader in the area stated, as an observer of the impact of, e.g. **\[R1\-5\]:** “ *Trinity Laban is one of the leading institutions in dance science and health. The research papers produced by Trinity Laban are referred to by students, graduates and faculty of the Beijing Dance Academy and Chinese dance science community more widely*” **\[1\]**. 

 Our small team of dance science research faculty deliver talks at national and international arenas addressing issues of dancer health and safe practice **\[R3\]** regardless of dance style and genre. Examples include various One Dance UK annual conferences, The *Acrobatics Training and Health Symposium*, National Centre for Circus Arts, London, *Swing Dance Championships*, London, *Safe Practice Day* for teachers at Rosella Hightower Conservatoire, Cannes, France and *DANscienCE* *Festival*, Queensland Australia. A further 80 plus presentations have been delivered in the last decade at the annual conferences of the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science \(IADMS\) and a special *Day for Teachers* was created by Trinity Laban colleagues for the IADMS conference in Pittsburgh, USA. 

 A substantial focus of our research is screening and profiling to gather important physiological data regarding dancers’ cardiorespiratory fitness capacities, joint range of motion and muscular endurance as a means of enhancing performance potential. We have offered our screening to professional dancers in several companies such as Studio Wayne McGregor, Mimbre, Boy Blue, Far from the Norm and Akram Khan Dance Company providing them with recommendations for effective training and health support. 

 In terms of teacher resources that have been created from our research, the textbook *Safe Dance Practice* \(Quin et al, 2015\) continues to appear on the reading lists of many universities worldwide and the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science *Bulletin for Dancers and Teachers,* a peer reviewed bi\-annual journal founded by researchers at Trinity Laban, that applies dance medicine and science theory and research to practical problems in dance education, continues to grow with a readership of 1000\+ individuals/organizations over the 1\-year span of 14 Nov 2019\-13 Nov 2020 with 5969 electronic page views **\[2a\]**. We convey many of our research findings into user\-friendly resource papers, which are freely available on the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science website. Our Resource Paper entitled, *Dance Fitness*, has become the most popular of IADMS' Resource Papers, in the number of views over this time, and also in the year 14 Nov 2019\-13 Nov 2020, with 6258 page views known \(web page version\) and presumably a similar number of un\-countable direct PDF downloads. *Dance Fitness* has the greatest reach of any of IADMS' resource papers, having been translated into the greatest number of languages: English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Greek, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish and is currently the most downloadable paper on the website **\[2b\]**. 

 Safe in Dance International is an organisation which has developed the international benchmark standard for Healthy Dance Practice for teachers working with dancers and endorses good and best Healthy Dance Practice in organisations and colleges. These certificates and courses were written by Trinity Laban dance science colleagues and are directly informed by research conducted by Trinity Laban. Maggie Morris, the Co\-Founder of Safe in Dance stated as an impact observer: “ *Trinity Laban’s research in dance science and health has had a significant impact within the dance sector. This research has directly informed the development of new industry certificates and professional development education courses for private dance teachers accessed by those in the UK and also overseas. The research has raised consciousness within the sector of the importance of safe dance practice and has resulted in new methods of teaching and learning dance. Trinity Laban is known as one of the world’s leading institutions in dance science and health and its research is far\-reaching*” **\[3\]**. 

 Other national and international professional organisations such as One Dance UK, Council for Dance, Drama and Musical Theatre, Healthy Dancer Canada utilise Trinity Laban’s dance science research as part of their advocacy and educational work. The Imperial Society of Teaching of Dancing \(ISTD\) conducts 250K examinations in 40 countries per year and the impact of the incorporation of the SiDI certificate within the ISTD teaching qualifications demonstrates further the non\-academic impact of our research. Karine Rathle, Director of Healthy Dancer Canada, spoke as an observer of Trinity Laban’s impact: “ *thanks to their example, more universities and conservatoires are integrating Dance Science into their programmes*” **\[4\]**. 

 Trinity Laban’s research has helped initiate more affordable access to first class dance specific healthcare and dance science support services across the UK through co\-founding the National Institute for Dance Medicine and Science. Andrew Hirst, the Chief Executive of One Dance UK, stated as an impact observer of e.g. **\[R1\-5\]**: “ *The research produced by Trinity Laban in the area of dance science and dance health has contributed significantly to the development of the field, globally. Evidence of this growth include new curricula and educational programmes in Higher Education and for the professional dance sector, additional and enhanced dance for health participatory opportunities for other populations and the formation of national networks and organisations such as the National Institute for Dance Medicine and Science and Healthy Conservatoires. As one of the leaders in the field of dance science, Trinity Laban’s research has also impacted upon the way in which many professional training schools train and support dancers, for example through injury prevention screening work and through improved methods of physiological preparation for the demands of performing*” **\[5\]**. 

 Trinity Laban’s research into the benefits of dance on older people’s lives is cited by Chief Executive of the Arts Council, Darren Henley **\[6\]**. Our research informs practitioner delivery **\[R6\]** and the holistic approach of our arts for health work is celebrated by the Arts Manager at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust who observed the tangible impact of a 10\-week Singing for Lung Health pilot targeting participants with chronic lung conditions, stating: “ *The positive impact that Singing for Lung Health had on our patients surpassed expectations and brought some wonderful benefits which we did not foresee. It soon became clear that as well as the physiological improvements the participants were reporting we were witnessing some really special, more holistic benefits. We know this has a tangible impact on both the health and wellbeing of those involved. Due to the success of Singing for Lung Health we have committed to more singing as a part of our arts programme next year*” **\[7\]**. The success of the pilot and participants’ self\-reported improvement in their breathing, fitness levels and psychological wellbeing **\[8\]** led to an expanded programme of activities delivered in collaboration between Trinity Laban and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust. The project also emphasised how methodologies originally developed within the dance science grouping could be applied to other art forms, such as music. 

 Our progressive model of practice seeks to embrace more nuanced and humanising parameters in how participatory arts are appraised **.** Our research calling for a shift towards more flexible evaluation strategies, the need for qualitative evidence, and a stronger platform for participants’ reflections **\[R7\]** is cited by King’s College London as a significant methodological shift **\[9\]**. *Beyond the Walls* **\[R8\]  sought to reimagine an arts for health project evaluation as a living, breathing, multi\-sensory encounter and conjure the lived experience of being present at a care home arts programme for people living with dementia. Described as a “ *must see show*” by reminiscence arts organisation Age Exchange **\[10a\]**, *Beyond the Walls* has been seen by more than 200 stakeholders including practitioners, funders, and participatory arts/arts and health professionals. A Professor of Social Sciences described the work as “ *a lesson in how powerful a performative approach to dissemination can be*” **\[10b\]** and the CEO of community dance organisation People Dancing stated that the approach to dissemination “ *is exemplary and should be ‘bottled’ and taken up by arts organisations around the country*” **\[10c\]**. 

 Trinity Laban’s research provides credibility and legitimacy to forms of practice that can be marginalised—notably arts practice with older people and other settings where creativity is sometimes assumed to be impaired. Collaborative research with King’s College London has transformed public understanding and helped to dispel stereotypes around the creative capacity of people with acquired brain injury **\[11\]**. Two creative outputs emerged from this research, the dance films *Switch & Shift* and the award\-winning *Porcelain* that foreground participants’ creativity **\[12\]**. The relationship between research and practice is highly iterative, with research findings feeding into practice and vice versa. Professional development programmes have shaped pedagogical and professional practices leading to secondary impact. A neuro\-physiotherapist supporting dance classes for people with an acquired brain injury reported becoming freer, more experimental and adventurous when working with their clients **\[13\]**. In recognition of the specialist nature of dance and health practice, a pilot professional development programme targeting early career professionals was described as confidence\-building and evaluation indicated that the programme led to a greater sense of empowerment amongst participants **\[13\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Fewer than 1 in 6 epileptic dogs are seizure\-free on standard medication. The RVC research team, focusing particularly on drug\-resistant cases, has characterised co\-morbidities and risk factors, together with relative risk for adverse drug effects and altered the profession’s understanding of the epilepsy syndrome. Their work has demonstrated the value of dietary supplementation with medium\-chain triglycerides \(MCTs\) as an adjunctive management option: enhancing seizure control, reducing drug side effects and behavioural abnormalities, and improving overall quality of life for pet and owner. An MCT\-rich diet is now marketed by Purina for this application. Professional communications and novel owner\-directed tools are driving the progression of more effective, holistic disease management. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A research programme utilising the dedicated epilepsy clinic, established at RVC in 2004, was developed by Professor Holger Volk from 2007. With canine behaviourist and animal welfare scientist, Dr Rowena Packer, the risk factors for drug\-resistant epilepsy were documented as being male and having previously experienced cluster seizures \[1\]. More in\-depth study of drug\-resistant canine epileptics showed that these dogs have a broader spectrum of brain dysfunction and demonstrate co\-morbidities of anxiety \[2\], attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder \[3\] and cognitive dysfunction \[4\], sharing remarkable similarities with human epilepsy. 

 The researchers, in collaboration with colleagues in practice and at Glasgow University, also demonstrated the relatively poor quality of life of canine epileptic patients and the negative effect recurrent seizures and the side effects of the standard antiseizure drugs \(ASDs\) had on the owners \[5\]. Based on these observed similarities and the promising effects of ketogenic diets in human patients with epilepsy, Volk proposed to Purina, the multinational pet nutrition company, trialling a diet high in MCTs, to assess possible reduction in seizure frequency. \(Purina was already investigating ketogenic diets for age\-related canine cognitive decline and Volk’s then unpublished data demonstrated cognitive dysfunction was part of the epileptic syndrome.\) 

 A 6\-month randomised controlled clinical trial involving drug resistant idiopathic canine epileptic dogs, comparing an MCT supplemented diet to a placebo diet in a cross\-over design, demonstrated a positive effect of the test diet on seizure frequency and number of days per month when seizures occurred \[6\]. Of the 21 dogs, 15 \(71%\) had reduced numbers of seizures whilst on the diet and 14% achieved seizure freedom. Overall, dogs had 30% fewer seizures whilst eating the diet when compared to placebo \(171 vs. 119 seizures\). Considering these dogs were already on drug treatment with their response to the pharmaceutical intervention not considered to be satisfactory, these results are remarkable and similar to drug trials in drug resistant canines. Furthermore, the behaviours associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder displayed by epileptic dogs involved in this study \(chasing and stranger directed fear\) reduced when they were eating the MCT\-enriched diet \[3\].  Volk and Packer went on to examine the effects of a dietary supplement of MCT added to the base diet of drug\-resistant dogs in an independent multicentre study funded by the American Kennel Club. They corroborated the earlier diet trial results, showing similar reductions in seizure frequency together with reduction in drug\-therapy related sedation and ataxia \[7\], and improvements in cognitive functioning \[8\] so contributing to improved quality of life of the dogs \[7\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Epilepsy affects around one in 111 dogs. This equates to approximately 88,000 pet dogs in the UK and 693,000 in the US. More than 80% continue to experience seizures on standard medication, along with frequent adverse drug effects including sedation and ataxia. In addition, the associated behavioural abnormalities, identified by RVC as characteristic of idiopathic epilepsy, mean that management is particularly challenging. As epilepsy generally develops after a pet is acquired and a bond with the animal formed, owners frequently adapt their lifestyle to care for their animals, even to the extent of altering their employment to accommodate the dog’s needs, which can severely affect their own quality of life. 

 Volk’s role was critical in proposing to Nestlé Purina PetCare that a diet formulated with MCTs should be trialled in drug\-resistant epileptic dogs and that this diet could also be useful in managing syndromes associated with idiopathic canine epilepsy that affect quality of life, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \(ADHD\) and cognitive dysfunction syndrome \[a\]. Volk hypothesised MCT supplemented diets could be useful to reduce the frequency of seizures in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy that were refractory to drug therapy and, in collaboration with Purina, designed a randomized, placebo\-controlled, double\-blinded, crossover study trial to test this. 

 Purina funded the study to be conducted at the RVC, and the results led to the development and commercialisation of the patented NC NeuroCare<sup>TM</sup> diet – the first product of its kind shown to have significant positive benefit in treatment of idiopathic epilepsy as an adjunct to drug therapy and in the management of related syndromes \(ADHD\) \[a\]. Previous work at Purina had demonstrated a positive effect of a lower concentration of MCT supplementation on normal ageing dogs with cognitive decline. The acceptability and efficacy of the higher level MCT supplemented diet used in the studies with the RVC provided impetus to assess the higher level of MCT supplementation in ageing dogs with cognitive dysfunction syndrome and positive effects were demonstrated, which led to the diet being additionally marketed for this indication \[a, b\]. 

 The product is now on sale in South America \(Brazil, 2016; Mexico 2018\), North America \(2017\), Canada \(2017\) and in Europe \(2018\) \[Text redacted for publication\] \[a\]. Purina has used the published paper presenting the results of the clinical trial conducted at the RVC in marketing this product to vets in North and South America \[a, b\]. \[Text redacted for publication\] 

 To address the issues that owners may be unwilling to alter a pet’s diet \(for example reasons of costs or to avoid digestive disturbance\) and so make this adjunctive approach to the management of canine epilepsy more accessible to a larger number of dogs, the RVC group showed the addition of a palatable MCT supplement to standard canine diets produced a similar effect. 

 A peer\-reviewed published survey of 297 owners of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy, recruited via Facebook in 2017, following publication of the diet trial study, showed that 67% of owners had changed their dog’s diet following diagnosis, with 46% giving dietary supplements, the most common being coconut oil \(high in MCTs\) or derived MCT oil \(71%\) \[c\]. To investigate perceptions of epilepsy research priorities by key stakeholders, online surveys of 414 owners of dogs with epilepsy, general practice \(GP\) vets, and veterinary neurologists were carried out by the RVC in 2016 and 2020. Non\-drug therapies \(including MCTs\) were ranked highly across the three groups in both surveys and significantly increased in their perceived importance across the two time points. Within non\-drug therapies, MCTs were rated 3rd highest out of 10 emerging non\-drug therapies for their potential to positively impact epilepsy management in 2020, with the highest ratings by owners; MCT supplementation was considered of ‘major’ or ‘great’ impact by 33.7% of respondents \(n=467\) \[d\]. 

 RVC’s research has played a leading role in showing that canine idiopathic epilepsy, particularly in those animals that continue to have seizures whilst on antiepileptic drugs, has more widespread effects on the brain leading to significant co\-morbidities that affect canine behaviour. This concept was new to veterinary clinical practice and is now accepted by specialist veterinary neurologists. Its inclusion in a general veterinary educational textbook is now disseminating the understanding across the profession \[e\]. The print book has sold in 29 countries worldwide, with top markets being the UK, US, Italy and India \[e\]. 

 Volk has taken the lead in educating veterinarians and owners about the scientific evidence upon which recommendations for diagnosing and treating canine epilepsy are based. He set up and led the International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force in publishing 7 consensus papers on epilepsy classification, diagnostic approaches, treatment and outcome measures \[f\]. He has also co\-authored 2 pivotal systematic reviews in canine epilepsy \[g\], defining the evidence based for antiepileptic drug efficacy and their adverse effects enabling veterinarians to evaluate the strength of evidence for recommending drug treatments. Additionally, Volk was the only UK author and co\-chair on the 2016 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine \(ACVIM\) consensus statement on seizure management in dogs, a review commissioned by the ACVIM to set down the state\-of\-the\-art recommendations, where >10% of original papers cited providing the evidence for these recommendations were co\-authored by the RVC group \[h\]. This consensus statement has been downloaded >50,000 times since publication \[h\]. Since 2013, Volk has also spoken extensively and internationally on this topic, giving >80 lectures at veterinary conferences in 17 countries. This case study’s research has had significant media coverage both online and offline. There is a strong RVC Canine Epilepsy dedicated social media channel with 7,315 followers and during this REF period this case has generated 44,555 unique visitors to the RVC website. Mass media combined coverage exceeds 15,000,000 across countries including UK, USA, Australia, Spain, Portugal. It has featured in veterinary professional media online and/or print including Vet Times \(circulation 18,000; monthly users online 528,256\), VetSurgeon.org \(monthly users online 14,536\) TodaysVeterinaryPractice.com \(60,000 users\), VetPracticeNews.com USA \(57,000 users\) AnimalsHealth.es \(33,000 users\), veterinaria\-atual.pt \(46,000 users\) and mrcvs.co.uk \(21,000 members\), and featured in consumer press and online sites including Australian Dog Lover \(93,000 users/month\), Dog Magazine \(109,000 readers\) and features on the American Kennel Club websites \(5,000 member organisations\) \[i\]. 

 The RVC group has undertaken web\-based and qualitative studies of owner perception of their pet’s condition and consequent quality of life issues for both. Their findings have informed the RVC Pet Epilepsy Tracker App, developed in collaboration with the Epilepsy Society \(who had created an app for the human condition\). This was the first app to facilitate owner monitoring and improvement of the lives of their epileptic pets and includes educational material and advice for emergency situations. The app has been downloaded >27,600 times since 2015, translated into 4 languages \(English, Dutch, French and German\), and is in use in 84 countries \[j\]. The app is also assisting in veterinary care, as owners can send their dog’s up\-to\-date medical history to their surgery. Detailed information can be recorded by owners regarding epileptic episodes, including duration, severity and what happened surrounding the event, which helps the vet better understand the patient’s condition. This collection of longitudinal data by owners, previously inaccessible to the profession, is providing the means to better understand disease progression in individual dogs and creating a resource for long\-term studies of the condition.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professors Page and Reid are major figures in two aspects of the responses to Brexit: the devolution dimension and its consequences for environmental law.  They have helped to shape debate, at Holyrood and Westminster and among stakeholders, on issues such as inter\-governmental relations, common frameworks, governmental accountability, and enforcement of environmental laws.  Their contribution has ensured that the political rhetoric has increasingly given way to action on the procedural and constitutional challenges raised, including the acceptance of the need for new environmental governance arrangements, ensuring that major questions are properly addressed. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Brexit raises major legal and political questions over the allocation of powers within the UK, since the devolution settlements were made when the UK’s membership of the EU was taken as a given and some issues were left open which would otherwise have required clear resolution in the establishment of devolved administrations.  Early work **\[R4\]** showed that the only practicable way to handle Brexit was to pass legislation providing for the continuity of existing EU law. Research building on previous studies **\[R3\]** further served to explain and highlight the complexities and implications of the current position **\[R2, R4\]**. 

 Most significantly, Page’s research demonstrated **\[R1\]** that many of the powers the Scottish Parliament possessed in areas such as agriculture, fisheries and the environment were powers in name only, because decisions in those areas were taken in Brussels rather than Edinburgh, but that they would become real powers once the UK left the EU. This in turn raised the possibility of the different nations of the UK heading in different directions if the devolution settlements were left unaltered, and in so doing threatening the integrity of the UK ‘internal market’. He also pointed out that, important though they undoubtedly are, the powers that would fall to the Scottish Parliament on EU withdrawal paled into insignificance in comparison with those in areas such as trade, competition and immigration that would fall to the UK Parliament, which in turn raised the question of what voice, if any, the Scottish Parliament would have in relation to decisions in those areas. 

 Page also identified how the political deadlock which subsequently arose over the destination of repatriated competences in the intergovernmental negotiations over the EU \(Withdrawal\) Bill might be resolved without either government losing face. He proposed a ‘standstill agreement’ whereby the disputed powers would continue to lie where they fell under the devolution settlement but that the governments would agree not to exercise them until such time as they had been replaced by the common frameworks to which they were by then committed, at which point the precise location of the powers would cease to be important. 

 The loss of the EU mechanisms to hold the government to account has also been identified as a significant issue, with environmental law as an area of particular relevance given the role of EU measures in shaping so much of the law and policy **\[R4, R5\]**.  Reid has played a key part in exploring the possible options for using existing or new mechanisms to provide an oversight role and ensure the enforcement of environmental commitments.  Both the UK and Scottish governments proposed the development of new arrangements for post\-Brexit environmental governance, but with significant differences and he has examined the options, identifying ways of reducing the negative impacts of the current fragmented progress **\[R6\]**. 

 Research has continued to explore the relationship between UK and devolved governments and parliaments on such issues, working out the consequences of the various options being discussed and shedding light on the heated disputes **\[R2, R5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Page has made two defining contributions to the debate over the destination of repatriated EU competences following the UK’s proposed withdrawal from the European Union. His early analysis **\[R1\]** was widely accepted as the authoritative statement on the formal and practical division of powers – no government, parliament or think\-tank thought it necessary to produce another \- and provided the starting point for all the work that was done subsequently in the UK’s parliaments and governments on the implications of EU withdrawal for devolved competences **\[E1, E3, E4, E5\]**. When the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, was asked by industry and other trade associations about the implications of EU withdrawal for decision\-making in the fields closest to their interests, he simply referred them to Professor Page’s ‘masterly analysis’. 

 The second major contribution was introducing the idea of a ‘standstill agreement’ to resolve the political deadlock over the destination of repatriated competences **\[E1\]**. Although both governments hesitated at the time, this solution was effectively adopted in the continuing negotiations over the replacement of EU regimes by common frameworks, and echoes appear in the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020. 

 Reid’s focus has been on environmental governance.  The report **\[E8\]** on *Environmental Governance in Scotland on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU*, by the sub\-group of the Scottish Government Round\-Table on Climate Change and Environment \(informed by **R4**\) was the basis for the provisions on environmental principles and governance in the UK Withdrawal from the European Union \(Continuity\) \(Scotland\) Bill passed in December 2020. More specifically, two suggestions by Reid to Westminster committees in relation to avoiding obstacles to collaboration between UK and devolved structures were endorsed by them **\[E6\]** and accepted in the Government’s responses to these and appear as clauses 24\(4\) and 40\(2\) of the Environment Bill as introduced at Westminster in early 2020. 

 Evidence based on their research has been heavily relied on by parliamentary committees since before the Brexit referendum in 2016 **\[E1\-E6\]**. At Westminster, Reid has given oral evidence to three different committees and Page to five committees \(six occasions\) as well as being appointed a special adviser to the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. At Holyrood, Page has given oral evidence before three committees \(five occasions\) and is a member of the Scottish Parliament’s Standing Committee of Experts; Reid has given evidence to two committees \(five occasions\) and was appointed in 2019 as a long\-term adviser to the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee at Holyrood.  As the Convener records **\[E10\]**, he has been “able to bring the findings from \[his\] earlier research and analysis to committee discussions which has been incredibly helpful and insightful”; examples include work  in response to the legislative consent motion on the Environment Bill which prompted the Scottish Government to refine its stance on the scrutiny of legislation. 

 In all cases the subsequent reports and discussions show that the evidence given has been used to mould these committees’ analysis and recommendations on issues such as inter\-governmental relations, common frameworks, mechanisms for parliamentary scrutiny, governmental accountability, and enforcement of environmental laws.  Although UK government processes have been resistant to external and expert inputs, the increasing attention to the procedural and constitutional challenges raised, including the acceptance of the need for new environmental governance arrangements, demonstrates the impact of their contribution \(with others\) in ensuring that major questions are properly addressed. 

 As well as the influence on official deliberations, Reid and Page have helped to shape the wider consideration of the Brexit challenges among stakeholders and practitioners, notably raising awareness in audiences in England of the significance of the devolution aspects of the Brexit process.  This has been reflected in the input these groups have made to policy formulation **\[E9\]** ensuring that such considerations are not overlooked in the evolving law and policy.  Both have been frequently called on to explain their analysis of the governance position at events for practitioners, policy\-makers, parliamentary staff, stakeholders and academics, and their work has been heavily used in preparing briefing papers **\[E7\]**. 

 Reid and Page’s research has also informed the substantial contributions made to official consultations and enquiries on Brexit and post\-Brexit environmental governance. Page is part of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Constitutional Law and Government Working Group and Reid of the Law Society of Scotland’s Environment Committee and the Brexit Task\-Force \(now Governance and Devolution Group\) of the UK Environmental Law Association \(UKELA\), where his contribution has been “ *singularly impressive and in particular has ensured that those operating solely within the English jurisdiction have been alerted to and addressed the implications for the devolved nations*” **\[E9\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into active power flow management undertaken at the University of Strathclyde resulted in the successful delivery of an active network management scheme on the Orkney Islands in 2009 and a spin\-out, Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd. Since August 2013, Smarter Grids Solutions has received GBP40,200,000 in revenue and grown their connected generators list to approximately 450MW. The technology has been utilised by leading power network companies to connect renewable energy generators in the UK, US and Europe, with ongoing projects globally, resulting in cheaper and greener energy available to customers, more efficient and flexible network operation, and cost savings for power generation companies and utility customers. All 6 UK distribution system operators have implemented active network management, with consistent expansion and investment in the technology since August 2013. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 This research was undertaken in the context of the growth of renewable generation in the UK and the barriers to its connection to the power system including overcoming network capacity constraints, which became the focus for this research. Ault and Currie collaborated with Scottish and Southern Energy Power Distribution Ltd \(SSEPD; now Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks\) to define the active power flow management problem, and design a management scheme that would allow for integrating renewable energy generation and reducing electrical losses. The researchers established the conceptual design for an active power flow management approach based on measurement of circuit power flows and the regulation of wind farm power output to relieve network constraints. This was based on methods to calculate the wind generation constraints and economic feasibility of wind power in such a scheme \[ **R1**\]. The wind generation \(later generalised to any type of generation or electricity demand\) constraint assessment enables a time series of electrical demand and generation \(in half\-hourly or higher resolution\) to be assessed over a significant assessment window \(e.g. years\) to quantify the number of constraint periods and the total constraint energy volume for one or more generators. The economic impact of loss of generation revenue from energy sales and any renewable certificates or incentives can then be calculated. The initial research resulted in the core concept for Active Network Management \(ANM\) with the Orkney power network. The core research contributed an ANM requirements specification \(including functional and non\-functional elements\), algorithms for control \(including identification and resolution of multiple power circuit constraints\) and a conceptual design \(including measurement, communications, control hardware and software\) for a deployable ANM system. The project was a significant step towards a deployable ANM solution based on underpinning power system and control research. The research also provided the necessary technical detail to allow discussion of the implementation of ANM concepts within the industry. 

 A further core research challenge tackled was a method for calculation of appropriate operating margins for an ANM scheme. This is important as operating margins that are too narrow present power network security risks while margins that are too conservative and wide limit access to the available network capacity for power generators. The research presented a method of calculating multiple operating margins that could be applied within an ANM scheme \[ **R2**\]. The practical implementation of an ANM scheme requires that a power network is organised into different zones of control and the research established the method for identifying these zones of control with reference to the identification of all possible network constraint locations. This approach was embodied in a patent \[ **R3**, **R4**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The research undertaken at the University of Strathclyde between 2003 and 2008, in close collaboration with Scottish & Southern Energy Power Distribution \(SSEPD\), resulted in a spin\-out, Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd, to commercialise the research \[ **S1**\]. From 2009, SSEPD started connecting additional wind generation to the Orkney power system under the ANM scheme with Smarter Grid Solutions, with reinforcement deferral savings of GBP30,000,000 from ANM scheme go\-live. Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd continue to be at the forefront of advising power companies on ANM technology and this impact on design and investment policy is a direct result of the research. Specifically, since August 2013, the research has: 

-  Enabled the growth and commercial success of Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd; 

-  Increased the number of clean energy assets connected to the grid in globally, resulting in cheaper and greener energy available to customers and cost savings for power generation companies; 

-  Informed the investment strategy and planning of distribution network and system operators in the UK, further supporting the expansion of clean energy. 

###  Enabling the growth and commercial success of Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd. 

 Smarter Grid Solutions Ltd \(SGS\) grew substantially from formation in 2008 with total revenues to the end of March 2013 standing at GBP6,100,000 \[ **S1**\]. By March 2020, the company’s annual revenue had grown to GBP10,040,000, with a total revenue since August 2013 of GBP40,200,000 \[ **S1**\]. As of 31<sup>st</sup> July 2020, SGS employs 75 FTE staff, based in Glasgow, New York and California \[ **S1**\]. Director and Co\-founder of SGS confirmed the importance of the underpinning research for the company’s business offer: 

 ‘The ANM scheme marketed by Smarter Grid Solutions, based on the original collaboration between the University of Strathclyde and SSPED, enables our partners to design and implement solutions to enable connection of Distributed Energy Resources \(DER\), whilst maximising network efficiency and maintaining network reliability... We now have an enviable track record with the leading innovator companies, covering all types and sizes of DER, based on the proven value of this technology.’ \[ **S1**\] 

 Since August 2013, SGS has expanded its original product, AMN 100, into two products – AMN Strata and AMN Element. Both products continue to be based on the fundamental research into ANM conducted at Strathclyde and were further informed by ongoing collaboration with current Strathclyde researchers \[ **S1**\]. The Director of SGS highlights how this collaboration ‘allows us to maintain our competitiveness and continually increase our business offer.’ \[ **S1**\] SGS has invested around GBP25,000,000 in product development based on the research, and received over GBP3,000,000 in external investment to further develop the products in 2017 \[ **S1**\]. According to the Director: ‘This level of investment is further evidence of the value of Active Network Management to the renewables energy sector. The application of ANM technology in our products enables our customers to develop and operate their networks more efficiently and flexibly as required and incentivized by industry regulators.’ \[ **S1**\] 

###  Increasing the number of clean energy assets connected to the grid globally 

 With SGS having proven the value of the technology since its establishment, more and more power generation and distribution companies are adopting ANM as part of their operational technology to complement existing systems. SGS’s connected generators list has grown to approximately 450MW as of July 2020, with contracts with distribution network operators to connect over 1GW in 2021 \[ **S1**\]. The operational systems list, using products with the Strathclyde IP, currently includes the UK, US and Europe \[ **S1**\]. Examples of the connections enabled by SGS, resulting in cheaper and greener energy available to consumers and cost savings for power generation companies, are presented below. 

####  Scottish Power Energy Network, 3,500,000 customers in the UK 

####  Scottish Power Energy Network \(SPEN\) partnered with SGS on ‘Accelerating Renewable Connections’, a four\-year project which concluded in 2016, and committed to implementing ANM in their 2015\-2023 Business Plan \[S2\]. Since August 2013, they have connected around 160MW of renewable energy in East Lothian, Scotland, using ANM, providing enough energy to power 160,000 homes \[S2\]. The Dunbar Energy Recovery Facility is an example of AMN implementation, with SGS enabling the provision of 258GWh of renewable energy direct to the National Grid from an existing waste treatment hub in East Lothian \[S2\]. This energy output is the equivalent of 39 wind turbines, and is enough to continuously power over 70,000 homes \[S2\]. SPEN’s analysis of the ‘Accelerating Renewable Connections’ project estimates that the savings in connection and network reinforcement costs from the application of ANM are in excess of GBP20,000,000 \[S2\]. In June 2020, SPEN reaffirmed their commitment to using ANM in their Distribution System Operator \(DSO\) Strategy ‘ *to get the best out of our existing network capacity, helping to keep bills low for customers and facilitate the drive to a more flexible, smart network required for NetZero.*’ \[S2\]. SGS have been engaged to deliver a wider network rollout of ANM with a new centralized system due to become operational during 2021, with several hundreds of MW of renewable generation connections in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, and North Wales expected thereafter \[S2\]. 

####  UK Power Networks, 8,300,000 customers across the East and South East of England 

 Similarly UK Power Networks \(UKPN\) partnered with SGS on their ‘Flexible Plug & Play’ project \(2011\-2014\), which demonstrated the value of adopting the approach for the company, who subsequently committed to implementing an ‘industry\-leading’ ANM system in their 2015\-2023 Business Plan \[ **S3**\]. This commitment has recently been accelerated, such that UKPN are now deploying the system two years ahead of schedule to help facilitate flexible renewable energy generation connections. Since defining the Business Plan, UKPN has connected over 120MW of solar, wind and biofuel generators in East Anglia, England, providing energy to power approximately 120,000 homes \[ **S3**\]. UKPN’s system, powered by SGS software, was described by respected independent American consultancy group Wood Mackenzie as ‘amongst the world’s most advanced’ and has delivered over GBP70,000,000 in savings for energy generator customers \[ **S3**\]. Flexibility contracts are now being introduced as a matter of standard practice for UKPN as part of their transition to DSO, so that all suitable newly connected generators will have the opportunity to benefit from ANM \[ **S3**\]. This rollout of flexible generation connections is expected to result in 2.5GW of generation connections and is the fastest and largest enterprise rollout of this technology \[ **S3**\]. 

####  SSE Enterprise, part of energy supplier SSE, 3,600,000 customers in the UK and Ireland 

 SSE Enterprise is responsible for providing SSE with innovative solutions for their energy infrastructure in the UK and Ireland, and adopted SGS’s ANM technology to support increased connection of renewable and other clean, distributed, flexible energy resources to the grid and market \[ **S4**\]. In particular, SSE Enterprise have used ANM Strata to connect their customer’s energy assets to their systems and markets \[Text removed for publication\] and have ongoing projects to connect generators at commercial and industrial customer sites, business and university campuses and local authority buildings \[ **S4**\]. Confirming the benefits of this technology, the Director of SSE Enterprise stated: ‘\[it is\] enabling us to meet our green ambitions, serve our customers well, keep our energy prices low and meet our business objectives… SGS’s expertise in control and aggregation has been invaluable to help us create a platform that operates as we need it to.’ \[ **S4**\] 

 **AVANGRID, 3,100,000 customers throughout New York and New England, US** 

 AVANGRID, part of the Iberdrola Group, partnered with SGS in 2015 to develop and conduct demonstration projects as part of the New York Reforming the Energy Vision policy \[ **S5**\]. The resulting project \- Flexible Interconnection Solutions \(FICS\) – was designed to demonstrate a process for energy generation developers and AVANGRID to curtail generation \(i.e. flexible capacity\) rather than conventionally reinforcing the grid \(i.e. firm capacity\). This approach maintains the viability and benefits of renewable development while ensuring the grid remains within service requirement specifications, such as voltage and equipment thermal limits, using SGS ANM technologies \[ **S5**\]. This solution encourages the development of distributed energy resources in the New York system and market. AVANGRID is leveraging this work to help meet the Reforming the Energy Vision policy goals of increasing distributed grid connections, reducing electricity costs and improving the environment \[ **S5**\]. In the future, FICS has the potential to enable additional DER interconnections that would not be viable under the current model \[ **S5**\]. 

 **Enzen Global Solutions Energy Consultants** 

 In 2020, SGS partnered with Enzen Global Solutions energy consultants to implement ANM in several global regions \(notably Australia and India\) and, in September 2020, announced a deployment project in the Southern Indian State of Tamil Nadu \[ **S6**\]. This area has a high proportion of wind and solar renewables, and ANM will be used to minimize renewable energy curtailment and improve system balancing. This project is the first of its kind in India and has a huge potential for scaling up in other parts of the country. Ultimately, this project will result in cheaper, quicker, and more flexible energy generation connections and will further advance India's clean energy goals \[ **S6**\]. Speaking in media coverage at the time, the Vice President of Enzen Global Solutions stated: ‘Enzen believes in leveraging best\-in\-class technology from across the globe to meet local needs, and that's why we're collaborating with Smarter Grid Solutions. The pilot is an important step in maximising renewable energy uptake by the grid, and realising the full benefit of renewable energy for electricity companies, project developers and communities.’ \[ **S6**\] 

###  Informing the investment strategy and planning of distribution network operators 

 The successful deployment of ANM technology on Orkney gave confidence to power companies to invest in further deployments of this technology under innovation funding \(i.e. Low Carbon Network Fund, Network Innovation Competition and Network Innovation Allowance\) and to include ANM technology in their investment plans for the period 2015\-2023 under the RIIO price control mechanism \[ **S2**, **S3**\]. This uptake of ANM was highlighted in the UK Government’s 2017 Smart Systems and Flexibility Plan as addressing the action on Distribution Network Operators to ‘make more efficient use of new technologies, providers and solutions *’* \[ **S7**\]. The Plan noted: ‘It is critical that DSO \[Distribution System Operators\], transmission owners \(TOs\) and the SO \[System Operator\] develop timely and appropriate reforms to the way they plan, operate and engage with one another and customers, in order to manage the networks more efficiently and minimise whole system costs… We are seeing progress now \(such as growth in active network management and greater coordination\), but further demonstrable progress must be made.’ \[ **S7**\] 

 In their recently published DSO strategies \(2017\-2020\), all 6 UK Network Operators committed to expanding ANM as a key aspect of their development plans \[ **S8**\]. As highlighted above, SPEN and UKPN have integrated ANM into their standard practice \[ **S3**, **S4**, **S8a**, **S8b**\]. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks \(SSEN\), as a collaborating partner in the Orkney project, specifically highlights the work of SGS and the University of Strathclyde in their DSO update: ‘SSEN pioneered flexible connections alongside Smarter Grid Solutions and the University of Strathclyde in Orkney’. \[ **S8c**\] By 2019, SSEN had made ANM available to all generator customers in SSEN distribution areas and had delivered over 200MW in flexible connections \[ **S8c**\]. Through their ANM Centralisation project, SSEN invested GBP1,800,000 in a new ANM system to support this roll\-out \[ **S8c**\]. In their DSO strategy published in February 2020 \[ **S8d**\], Western Power Distribution, who have been rolling out ANM since 2016, stated their intention to ‘Roll out Active Network Management across entire network by 2021, with expanded connections options available for customers allowing them to get quicker and cheaper access to the network’ \[ **S8d**\]. Electricity North West listed ANM as an ‘enabler’ and committed to implementing a whole system ANM suite to allow dispatch of flexible resources and help manage the flow of energy, highlighting ‘whole system benefits through coordination between transmission and distribution requirements delivering efficient network solutions and striking the right balance between new build and flexible solutions.’ \[ **S8e**\] Northern Powergrid, who already have one live ANM zone in the North of England and 433MW of contracted flexibility across three other ANM zones, also included ANM as a ‘key enabler for decarbonisation’ stating: ‘through ANM, we are able to actively manage exports from generation customers in order to provide them with cost\-effective connections to the distribution network. This scheme is ground\-breaking for us, as it is our first replicable scheme, meaning that we now have a standardised solution that we can roll out anywhere this situation occurs on our network.’ \[ **S8f**\] 

 Through the commercialisation of ANM products sold by SGS, the Strathclyde research developing ANM has been picked up by leading distribution network operators to provide cleaner and more efficient energy, and has enabled them to adapt to Government regulations and recommendations. Summarising the benefits of partnering with SGS, Head of Smart Grid Development at UK Power Networks stated: 

 ‘By increasing the connection of renewable energy resources, we are able to meet our network development, customer connections and clean energy goals, improve the flexibility and efficiency of our network, and reduce the costs of network connection for energy generators as well as our customers… we consider ‘efficient and effective’ networks and being ‘net zero ready’ to be key innovation themes that support our business offer and Smarter Grid Solutions enables that.’ \[ **S3**\]

 **1.Summary of the impact** 

 Public green spaces make a major contribution to the health and happiness of urban citizens and visitors. Nottingham’s green spaces occupy almost 20% of the city, and the oldest public green spaces continue to perform a vital role in the city’s civic offer and the lives of inhabitants and visitors. However, their origins and development are not fully understood, and there is a disconnect between the historical significance and the contemporary management and use of these green spaces. Research led by Beckett has filled this gap and has been essential in creating a meaningful and sustainable connection between past and present. This has: 

-  informed policy, shaped practice and enhanced protection for Nottingham’s historic green spaces 

-  fostered capacity for community and volunteer\-led research and empowered citizens to protect local heritage 

-  popularised Nottingham’s historic green spaces through increased public awareness and engagement and enhanced understanding 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research, led by Beckett, has demonstrated the **pivotal role** of Nottingham’s **historic green spaces** **past and present**. Nottingham was one of the most densely built, overcrowded towns in early 19<sup>th</sup>\-century England, ravaged by poverty, disease and death **\[3.1, 3.4\]**. It was also the **first** major industrial town to provide open ‘green’ spaces for the purposes of **health and recreation** in response to national legislation. The **1845 Nottingham Enclosure Act** set aside 130 acres of land to provide **open ‘green’ spaces for the townspeople**. These were the Forest Recreation Ground, the Arboretum, Church \(Rock\) and General Cemeteries, several smaller parks and cricket grounds and the ‘walks’ \(Queen’s Walk, Elm Avenue, Corporation Oaks and Robin Hood Chase\) **\[3.1\]**. Beckett’s research, the first to consider these Enclosure spaces together as **a planned scheme**, led to a better understanding of planned green spaces in urban history. 

 Beckett’s extensive research has charted the history of these green spaces, examining their **creation and development** and the combined role of government, local authority and philanthropic involvement in ensuring Nottingham had **accessible green spaces** **\[3.1\-3.4\]**. The research has been critical in understanding the **crucial role** green spaces have played in Nottingham’s history and the lives of **Nottingham people**, and the **diverse uses made of them \[3.1\]**. They provided focal points for recreation, celebrations, sports and natural history. They were also **contested spaces**: pivotal to health and recreation but also perceived as the focus for crime and antisocial behaviour; public spaces open to everyone but under threat of encroachment; and intended to be free but subject to controversial admission charges. They were central to the lives of townspeople, civic pride and cultural emulation. Their origins, and diverse and contested usage, have affected **decision making and perceptions** about these green spaces throughout their history **\[3.1\]**. Beyond the significance to Nottingham, Beckett demonstrated that these green spaces constitute one of the **most ambitious schemes of urban improvement** in mid\-nineteenth century Britain **\[3.1\]**. 

 These ideas are developed through Beckett’s close examination of the **next phases of greening the city** and its suburban hinterland **\[3.2\]**. The creation of public parks and other green open spaces was a key part of **urban policy making**, and Beckett demonstrated the importance of Nottingham as a case study for understanding wider issues and implications of **shaping urban spaces**. Moreover, Beckett highlighted how the debates and issues that were integral to the creation and development of these green spaces remain **pivotal today**: health and recreation, contested space, responding to legislation and local demand **\[3.2\]**. 

 Beckett’s expertise in the theory and application of **local history** **\[3.5\]** was **paramount** in leading and stimulating co\-produced research **\[3.7\-3.9\]**. Beckett’s work stressed the **importance of connecting with communities** **\[3.5\]**. Together with Beckett and Paul Elliott \(University of Derby\) as the academic leads, Coope and Mills \(research fellows\) regularly met with community partners and coordinated community\-led research. Coope and Mills demonstrated the beneficial impact of this community engagement on **shaping research agendas and connecting past histories with contemporary communities** **\[3.6\]**. Beckett, Coope and Mills led the co\-produced research but developed their research agenda in response to community partners, ensuring it addressed the concerns and needs of **local communities**. **\[3.1\]**. 

 The research has highlighted the **vital role** of green spaces in urban centres over time and the relevance of the 1845 legislation for policy, protection and use today. Through its multi\-disciplinary community\-led nature, ‘The Social World of Green Spaces’ project, led by Beckett and working with Nottingham City Council, the Open Spaces Forum, Friends of the Forest and of Nottingham Arboretum, Nottingham Women’s History Group, Framework Housing, the Mapperley and Sherwood History Group and the Nottinghamshire Local History Association, has **connected the forward\-thinking initiatives of the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century with protection of, and engagement with, green spaces in the 21<sup>st</sup> century**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Beckett and the ‘Green Spaces’ project team have created **a meaningful and sustainable connection between past and present management and uses** of Nottingham’s green spaces. Nottingham’s **oldest public green spaces**, created in response to 1845 legislation, continue to **perform a vital role** in the lives of inhabitants and visitors. However, their origins and development are not always fully understood, which has put parks and green spaces at risk of encroachment. Working with Nottingham City Council \(NCC: who own, manage and promote these green spaces\) and the Open Spaces Forum \(OCF: who work in partnership with NCC and bring together other stakeholders to protect and enhance open and green space in the city\), the Green Spaces project has **informed their policies and protected green spaces**. The project has also **enhanced understanding** of the significance of these interconnected historic green spaces as a planned scheme and raised the profile of lesser known green spaces. The project has foregrounded the original ethos of open spaces for everyone, for recreation and health, as embodied in the 1845 Enclosure Act. Working with **diverse project beneficiaries** including Friends organisations, community history researchers, mental health groups and the wider public, the project has **increased public awareness and enhanced understanding** of these green spaces. Co\-production, which has been central to this project, **has fostered capacity** for community and volunteer\-led research and **empowered citizens** to protect local heritage. 

 <ins> **1.</ins> <ins></ins><ins>In</ins><ins>forming policy, shaping</ins> <ins>practice and enhancing protection**</ins> 

 Parks and open spaces occupy a key role within NCC’s leisure and culture portfolio, and Beckett’s work has been pivotal in **informing policy, shaping practice and enhancing protection** for Nottingham’s historic green spaces **\[5.3\].** The Parks and Open Spaces Development Manager said the increased knowledge base provided by Beckett, which would otherwise *‘not have been easily available’*, has *‘enhanced the Council’s ability to protect and promote these spaces’* by providing the historic context and justification for their protection and long\-term preservation **\[5.3\]**. Bespoke Fact Files, compiled in direct response to demand for further information from the NCC, have provided *‘concise, accessible and factual information…which is invaluable for overcoming challenges concerning continuity of staff and capacity to undertake original research in terms of time and expertise’* **\[5.3\]**. The research has also shaped the annually updated management plans for individual parks and open spaces, ensuring they are *‘appropriate and legal within the context of the history of a particular green space’* **\[5.3\]**. The research has *‘informed a review of policy and strategy relating to the management and maintenance of green spaces. The Future Parks Accelerator Project, a 25\-year strategy for the City’s parks, benefitted from the project research and again the history and background of these parks, especially the links with health’* **\[5.3\]**. 

 Improved knowledge and understanding of the **1845 Nottingham Enclosure Act** and creation of these green spaces is **crucial in enhancing protection** as it *‘has a bearing on how sites can be used and developed today and the project findings have help\[ed\] to challenge inappropriate pressures on sites’* **\[5.3\]**. The Open Spaces Champion and Trustee of the Open Spaces Forum highlighted that the project research has been used to challenge *‘threats and encroachments onto public land’,* and *‘having the research findings easily available…\[is\] an important resource to help ensure that the spaces continue to be managed and development \[sic\] in an appropriate way, especially when funding is tight’* **\[5.10\]**. Beckett’s involvement ensured that all the open green spaces created by Nottingham’s 1845 Enclosure Act were considered collectively as *‘a planned scheme’*, *‘something that no one or no other group had done before’* but that is *‘fundamental to the heritage of the City’* **\[5.10\]**. The research has also been **instrumental in addressing contemporary issues of accessibility and contested space,** as it demonstrates *‘there have always been tensions’* but that *‘they are not and never have been an excuse to stop people using the parks’* **\[5.10\]**. 

 The project has **shaped** the Parks Department’s **public engagement strategies** and directly led to **better visibility of the histories** of local parks. *‘Part of the role of the Parks Development Team is to engage with Citizens and local communities, to get “buy\-in” and respect for places; this can be difficult and the history project was a different and longer\-lasting way for us to engage…and a means of promoting a better understanding of our spaces by the general public’* **\[5.3\]**. Community engagement activities, underpinned by Beckett’s research and led by the project team, enabled the council to *‘engage with park\-users in both traditional and innovative ways’* **\[5.3\]**. These included illustrated interpretation panels designed for the Arboretum, the Forest Pavilion, and Queen’s Walk Park; a series of downloadable trails and creative performances in parks. The significance of the Enclosure Tree Trail is that it allowed NCC *‘to join the historic spaces together into one walk that explores different parts of the City and highlights the historic importance of the spaces’* **\[5.3\]**. These initiatives led NCC to *‘look for alternate uses for historic spaces’* and *‘inspired future engagement’* **\[5.3\]**. The project resources have raised the profile of the Enclosure spaces and brought them to the attention of a wider public. This is crucial as parks are *‘increasingly dependent on volunteers to keep them maintained’* which means *‘parks need to have high profiles’* **\[5.10\]**. The ‘Green Spaces’ project has shaped the development and management of Nottingham’s parks and green open spaces for at least the next quarter of a decade **\[5.3\].** 

 <ins> **2. Fosterin</ins><ins>g capacity for community and volunteer\-led research</ins> <ins></ins><ins>and empowering citizens to protect local heritage**</ins> 

 The project fostered **meaningful and sustainable relationships** between local history and community groups and with the University of Nottingham. **Co\-production** was at the heart of the ‘Green Spaces’ project, with community partners fully integrated throughout. These included Friends of the Forest and of Nottingham Arboretum, Nottingham Women Group, Mapperley and Sherwood History group and the Nottinghamshire Local History Association. Volunteers reflected that *‘everyone felt integral to the team…that all their contributions were valuable…’* **\[5.2\]** and *‘mutual trust was established between the project team and the community groups’* **\[5.1\]**. Beckett’s expertise in **facilitating and coordinating** large community history projects, was **instrumental** to this. 

 The project **facilitated interconnections between researchers and community groups**, and explored the **intersections between past and present uses** of the green spaces. Two interdisciplinary events, ‘Social History of Public Urban Green Spaces’ \(January 2014\), brought together a range of stakeholders and beneficiaries including project volunteers, local historians, representatives of NCC and external academics. These were pivotal in identifying community research agendas and led to sustained communication, collaboration and co\-production. **\[5.8, p.8\]**. This also motivated and inspired research activities in existing local history groups **\[5.1, 5.2\]**, and led to knowledge exchange across a diverse range of groups who ‘ *realised that we all had overlapping and inter\-related interests and agendas… resulting in greater communication and collaboration amongst previously disparate \[groups\]’* **\[5.1\]**. 

 The project provided a **new skill base amongst volunteers and increased capacity for research to protect heritage**. Project volunteers were **empowered** by the collaborative processes underpinning the co\-production, which were informed by Beckett’s research on, and expertise in, the practice of local and community history. One volunteer reflected: *‘It was led by the academic team but we all worked together in a genuine collaboration…I worked closely with Jonathan Coope to research the impact of war on Nottingham’s parks…\[We\] gave a joint presentation on ‘Parks in Wartime’ at the annual anniversary of the opening of the Arboretum \[and have\] jointly written a series of articles for the project website’* **\[5.2\]**. Volunteers went on to **successfully apply the expertise and skills acquired to other research projects** across the East Midlands, providing **increased research and archival capacity** in the cultural, museum and archive sector. Volunteer A highlighted that the project *‘encouraged me to participate in and contribute to another community history’* **\[5.1\]**; whilst volunteer B stated that *‘it made me a better and more efficient researcher and game me the confidence to do more research…I am now an active member of the Great Central Railway heritage group and I have been able to use the research experience gained on the green spaces project to great advantage’* **\[5.2\]**. By fostering community\-led research in partnership with the academic team, the project ensured the transferability and sustainability of skills with applied outcomes. 

 **3.** <ins> **Popularising</ins> <ins>Nottingham’s historic green s</ins><ins>paces through increased</ins> <ins>and enriched public awareness and</ins> <ins>understanding**</ins> 

 Community engagement initiatives have **increased awareness** of **the connections between the historic creation and contemporary uses** of parks and green open spaces **and the links between each of these green spaces**. Beckett’s role was crucial as he was *‘the first to research all the open spaces’* created by the 1845 Enclosure Act, *‘examining not just the 19<sup>th</sup> century creation of the spaces but also 20<sup>th</sup> century developments, threats to space…and how the use of the spaces has changed over time’* **\[5.3\]**. This has **enriched understanding of and engagement** **with** well\-known parks and open spaces: *‘The spaces are accessible but thanks to the work of the University of Nottingham, the stories behind them have become more accessible too\!’* **\[5.7\]**. 

 The project enabled **Nottingham residents to discover, appreciate and enjoy green spaces in new ways**. In 2016, Excavate produced a **community play** and ten ‘talking\-head’ videos based on the project research. This **immersive theatre** performance took place across multiple historic green spaces in the city including the Arboretum, Queen’s Walk and The Forest. The **multi\-site performances** connected a **wide\-ranging audience** with a **tangible past** and **enriched public understanding** about *‘the link between the parks and how vital there were \(and are\!\)’* **\[5.3\]**. Approximately 400 people watched the play: 97% of respondents said it was an effective way to learn about history and heritage and 92% said it had **changed their understanding of the history or importance of Nottingham’s parks \[5.11\]**. The event *‘brought history to life’*, relating *‘the places we know’* to histories *‘never really spoken of’*, in a *‘very accessible way’* and *‘transformed…understanding of how our green spaces came* *about*’ **\[5.11\]**. The play crucially explored why that history is **still important to 21<sup>st</sup> century park\-users**. Its central message of how the **1845 Nottingham Enclosure Act** created **accessible open spaces**, how this was challenged historically, and the **key role Nottingham citizens played** \(and continue to play\) in ensuring Nottingham’s green spaces remain accessible for everyone, **inspired visitors**: *‘I came away feeling inspired: I want to find out more’* **\[5.11\]**. Beckett’s pioneering work on the inter\-relationship between the green spaces informed the production of the play. *‘Artistically it pushed us in a way that we haven’t been pushed before, in that we have never created a site specific show for multiple sites with the need to alter the script in subtle ways for each performance’* **\[5.5\]**. The play **changed Excavate’s approach to stage performance** and **led to new artistic partnerships**, which *‘have continued since…and now become a feature of our work’* **\[5.5\]**. The success of the play has since cascaded to influence **similar engagement activities across the city \[5.3\]**. 

 Exhibitions **raised the profile** of the Enclosure green spaces and enabled venues to deliver on their mission to **serve local communities**. The co\-curated ‘Nottingham’s Historic Green Spaces’ exhibition \(2016\) and the re\-display of exhibition panels in the Arboretum café and Forest Pavilion, **promoted the work of volunteer and community researchers** and **enhanced understanding of the historical significance**. The exhibition also enabled local studies librarians to *‘deepen knowledge of their own collections’* which contributed to their professional development and showcased the resources of Nottingham City Library. This is *‘very important’* because *‘the library service has not been very good at publicising what it holds and what it does’*. **Demand for information** about the Arboretum and Forest by library visitors is high and yet there was *‘very little accessible information about these spaces’*. The exhibition, website and project resources have enabled the library *‘to meet the interest in the history and protection of green spaces’* **\[5.4\]** The project therefore increased the ability of the library to engage with their audience. 

 The project has popularised green spaces amongst **diverse audiences**, with beneficiaries including schoolchildren and vulnerable adults **\[5.8\]**. Creative activities, including a **poetry competition**, workshops and Victorian games, engaged young people \(c. 100\) and encouraged them to appreciate **green spaces as interactive learning environments \[5.8\]**. The project **changed the practice** of the Framework Housing Association’s ‘Nature in Mind’, a **mental health project for vulnerable adults** hosted in Nottingham’s parks and open green spaces: *‘As a result of the activities Nature in Mind did with the University of Nottingham’s Green Spaces project, we now use the Arboretum on a regular basis. The project introduced us to the Friends of the Arboretum and we are working with them to organise further events’*. The benefits of these sustained activities and partnerships include *‘social contact, fresh air and exercise, and learning about the nature and heritage of local green spaces’* **\[5.6\]**. 

 The project website **\[5.9\]** remains an important platform for **knowledge exchange**, **showcasing** the co\-produced research, **enabling new visitors** to engage with multi\-media resources and **promoting popular participation** with the **histories** of Nottingham’s green spaces and **heritage protection**. During 2016, 3,520 people \(12,473 page views\) used the website, including from Europe, America and Australia as well as the UK. From 2017 to 2020, 13,084 users have accessed the website, including 3,704 new users in 2020 alone **\[5.9\]**.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 University of the West of Scotland \(UWS\) plays a pivotal role in Europe’s global leadership in 5G – a vital technology used across a wide range of crucial sectors, including energy, healthcare, security etc. UWS’ ground\-breaking research has led the development of Europe’s 5G Golden Nugget innovation, and visions encapsulated within official White Papers. UWS’ 5G network management and control solutions have been deployed in the 5G trial testbeds of several leading 5G industries. Furthermore, UWS’ pioneering research has directly led to the development of the ITU \(International Telecommunication Union\) and ETSI \(European Telecommunications Standards Institute\) global ICT standards – essential to interoperability and innovation of international ICT systems. Further impact on national policies was achieved in the Scotland’s AI Strategy.

### 1.  Underpinning research 

 **Research originality, rigor and quality:** University of the West of Scotland’s \(UWS\) Beyond5GHub team with the AVCN \(Artificial\-Intelligence, Visual Communications and Networks\) Centre has been intensively researching 5G since 2014, leveraging UWS and industry partners’ 5G testbeds, and producing internationally leading 5G innovations in enabling technologies and applications. The outstanding quality of the research was recognised by an international expert evaluation panel \(“Exceptional results” in the official EU project evaluation report\), and worldwide peer reviewers for leading journal publications \(including 10\+ IEEE transaction/journal papers\). 

 **Research outcomes and significance:** Highlighted UWS outcomes include solutions for a novel autonomous network management framework to achieve ‘self\-organising’ 5G networks. These solutions enable the automatic detection, and resolution, of a range of common network problems and fulfil essential network management tasks \(traffic optimisation, service creation and infrastructure deployment and protection, etc.\) that are currently manually addressed by network operators, resulting in substantial operating expenditure reduction. 5G real\-time traffic 'self\-optimisation' capability and multi\-tenant\-aware network monitoring are enabled by novel 5G\-UHD **\[3.1\]** and 5G\-QoE techniques to reduce up to 50% of bandwidth requirements for video traffic – which itself represents 80% of worldwide traffic – without compromising users’ Quality of Experience \(QoE\), even when the network is experiencing cyberattacks or congestion. Moreover, UWS led the achievement of one of the six European 5G\-PPP KPIs on the reduction of service creation time, decreasing from 90 hours to 90 minutes, by producing a novel on\-demand one\-click 5G infrastructure deployment solution **\[3.2\]** to automatically deploy and configure a new 5G edge network from bare\-metal commodity computers in less than 40 minutes, significantly reducing both capital expenditure and operating expenditure. The pioneering self\-organising framework was further applied to ‘self\-protection’ against cyberattacks **\[3.3\].** 

 UWS has also focused on developing the cornerstone 5G technology ‘Network Slicing’, and successfully achieved massive \(approximately 1,000,000 per 4 software switches\) data\-plane network slices **\[3.4\]** in super\-fast networks \(up to 100 Gbps\) with guaranteed Quality of Service for multiple verticals over the same infrastructure, with significant reduction in capital expenditure and new business models enabled. The solutions were demonstrated in various use cases; for example, saving lives by enabling 5G ambulance eHealth **\[3.5\]** for early stroke assessment during transit, and Smart Grid self\-healing to protect critical energy infrastructure. To enable intuitive management of complex virtualised 5G networks, a novel augmented reality\-based holographic network monitoring and management solution **\[3.6\]** was created, enabling visualisation of millions of 5G network nodes and multiple virtual network operators concurrently. Furthermore, UWS collaborated with other international 5G projects, including ANASTACIA on 5G\-IoT security management **\[3.3\]**, and MATILDA on 5G Smart City lighting. 

 **International research leadership:** The above outcomes were achieved through several UWS\-led international 5G projects, including two large EU Horizon 2020 Research & Innovation projects, SELFNET \(Phase\-1\) and SliceNet \(Phase\-2\). UWS technically led the projects, coordinating the R&D with global 5G players and beneficiaries including Orange, DellEMC, Altice \(“Portugal Telecom”\), Ericsson, IBM, EFACEC, etc. 

 **Generate further income towards 6G:** UWS has secured two new EU Horizon2020 5G Phase\-3 projects, 6G\-BRAINS \(H2020\-ICT\-2020\-2/101017226, EUR5,700,000\) and 5G\-INDUCE \(H2020\-ICT\-2020\-2/101016941, EUR6,000,000\), from 2020 to 2022 to investigate advanced 5G towards 6G.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Develop Europe’s 5G vision, innovation and trials** 

 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership \(5G\-PPP\) is the leading joint programme between the European Commission \(EC\) and European ICT industry, to deliver 5G architectures, technologies and standards – UWS research and influence has played an important role in shaping its decisions. 

 5G\-PPP Technology Board \(TB\) has adopted the following 5G\-PPP programme\-level “Golden Nuggets” \(flagship European 5G innovation achievements\) – influenced by UWS research though UWS Board members **Alcaraz Calero** and **Wang**. These include: 5G PPP Phase 1 Golden Nuggets **\[5.1\]:** “Autonomic network management” **\[3.1, 3.3\],** “Automated physical and virtual infrastructure deployment” **\[3.2\],** and “Multi\-level, multi\-tenant\-aware network monitoring” **\[3.6\];** and 5G PPP Phase 2 Golden Nuggets **\[5.1\]:** “AI\-empowered cognitive network management & orchestration” **\[3.5\],** and “End\-to\-end multi\-domain multi\-tenants network slicing” \[ **3.4, 3.5\].** 

 10 high\-profile and widely\-cited official 5G\-PPP White Papers commissioned by the EC, and co\-authored by UWS, have led the EC to adopt the vision on 5G Autonomous network management architecture **\[5.2\]** and 5G Software\-Defined Networking \(SDN\) and Network Function Virtualisation \(NFV\) integration **\[5.2\]**, strategies on 5G innovations for new business opportunities, especially service creation and security **\[5.3\],** and network slicing trials for eHealth **\[5.3\].** 

 UWS was the only Scottish university in 5G\-PPP, and one of the very few UK universities that technically led both Phase\-1 \(SELFNET\) and Phase\-2 \(SliceNet\) projects; thereby being positioned to influence Europe’s 5G vision, strategies, innovation and trials, and bringing to bear world\-leading UK academic expertise. 

 **Create global impact through international standardisation** 

 Working with the International Telecommunication Union \(ITU\) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute \(ETSI\), UWS has led the standardisation in relation to six official standardisation Work Items, focusing on cognitive/intelligent management and control of Network Slicing – a key enabler in 5G for network operators and vertical businesses. Two of these Work Items have been approved as ITU Draft Recommendations **\[5.4, 5.5\]** \(“The impact of interoperability and innovation enabled by the above work items extend beyond the current networks into foreseeable future”, as acknowledged by ITU FG\-AN Vice Chair\)\], one approved as ETSI POC \(Proof\-of\-Concept\) etc. **\[5.6\]** in collaboration with Orange, Altice, DellEMC, IBM etc. ITU is the United Nations' world\-leading standardisation organisation for mobile telecommunications. ETSI, on the other hand, is responsible for establishing European and globally applicable ICT standards. Such exceptional achievements were particularly appreciated in the project final review **\[5.9\].** 

 Moreover, UWS influenced de\-facto industry standards via open source projects: Open vSwitch \(de\-facto software\-networking platform\) benefited from UWS’ enabling 5G\-compatible processing capabilities **\[5.6\]**; OpenAirInterface \(leading global 5G infrastructure platform\) benefited from UWS’ 5G topology management facility **\[5.6\].** 

 **Impact on Europe’s commercial 5G networks and vertical business trials** 

 Orange Group's first commercial 5G network in Romania was launched on 5 November 2019, benefiting from UWS\-led SliceNet and UWS development of mobile edge computing \(MEC\) \(as acknowledged by Orange Development & Innovation Manager **\[5.7\]** and CEO **\[5.9\]**\). UWS’ 5G network slice solutions have been deployed in the 5G trial testbeds of leading European 5G industries including DellEMC \(Ireland\), Orange Romania, Altice \(Portugal\) etc. 

 Importantly, UWS developed Network Slicing trials for service quality assurance in eHealth, with DellEMC and Irish Ambulance Services, to reduce fatalities of onboard stroke patients by 25% **\[5.3\]** \(as acknowledged by DellEMC Principal Research Scientist **\[5.8\]**\), and in Smart Grid Self\-Healing with the largest Portuguese energy company EFACEC, to reduce maintenance costs by up to 20% \(as acknowledged by EFACEC Director of Technology and Innovation **\[5.8\]**\). UWS technologies were also applied to smart city lighting system in Bucharest with Orange Romania, to reduce energy costs by 77% \(as acknowledged by Orange Development & Innovation Manager **\[5.7\]**\). The UWS\-led 5G autonomous network management solution was deployed in Altice, leading to the ETSI POC **\[5.6\]** \(as acknowledged by Altice AI/Cognitive Solution Architect **\[5.7\]**\). 

 **Policy and wider impact** 

 UWS’ beneficial impacts, in terms of knowledge transfer to industries, have been further recognised through a highly prestigious national accolade: UK Times Higher Education \(THE\) Awards 2020 \- Knowledge Exchange/Transfer Initiative of the Year Award **\[5.10\]**. “The judges applauded how the team had built on successive projects to demonstrate life\-saving applications, commending the ‘growing stature of the academic team and their work to create AI\-based business solutions’.” **\[5.10\].** 

 In recognition of its demonstratable world\-leading expertise in 5G\-AI **\[5.10\]**, UWS was invited as a Member of Scotland’s AI Strategy \- Developing AI & AI Enabled Services and Products Working Group **\[5.10\]**, to have helped the Scottish Government in defining its nationwide AI strategy for businesses and research through extensive consultation in 2020. The Scotland’s AI Strategy has been recently launched **\[5.10\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 We developed the first evidenced based tools and interventions underpinned by psychological theory for people living with Cystic Fibrosis \(PwCF\). These address the problems of non\-adherence to demanding treatment regimens and engagement in health risk behaviours \(HRB\), and significant problems with eating. 

 These tools increased knowledge and confidence in healthcare professionals and thus influenced healthcare practices. One tool was aimed at patients to address the challenges of adherence and health risk behaviours and another addressed problematic eating behaviours. Both resulted in a greater understanding of how to manage their condition. Combined with the influence on healthcare practices, PwCF had an improvement in the level of care they received. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Treatment regimens for PwCF are burdensome, taking between 3\-4 hours daily. PwCF frequently experience health deteriorations, require hospitalisation, and this happens regardless of their adherence efforts. Such extensive regimens thus reduce motivation. Non\-adherence to regimens and engagement in HRBs are significant issues impacting morbidity and mortality. Our research was vital because little work had been published in double\-blind peer review outputs, which addressed such problems in PwCF. 

 Our comparison \( **R01**\) of weekday and weekend adherence to treatment regimens in adults showed adherence was higher during the weekend and was predicted by sex, anxiety, depression and lung function. This research identified psychosocial factors associated with non\-adherence in addition to time and high treatment burden. Findings provided a strong rationale for investigating adherence qualitatively. 

 Life expectancy for PWCF has rapidly increased over the last 20 years in the UK from 18 to 47 years, presenting new challenges for healthcare professionals \(HCPs\) and adult patients. HCPs now need to account for new risk factors because of PwCF’s increased life expectancy, including PwCF’s self\-management of treatment regimens and HRB such as drinking, smoking and illicit drug use. Our qualitative studies with patients identified \( **R02\)** that psychological factors influenced engagement, including a desire for normalcy where HRB minimised illness identity and a life\-oriented perspective where engagement was for fun. A dilemma was highlighted between adhering to treatment regimens and missing treatments to improve psychological wellbeing. 

 **There was a lack of patient knowledge on the CF specific impact of HRB, with little relevant information provided by HCPs.** 

 Interviews with HCP \( **R03**\) identified risky behaviours in PWCF were a major concern and that education regarding the adverse health effects of HRB was not currently embedded within clinical practice. Lack of HCP knowledge in HRB was reported. **Our research demonstrated the need for improved knowledge and integration of health risk behaviour information and interventions within CF care.** 

 **Eating behaviour and nutritional status** 

 Weight and BMI are independent predictors of mortality, but CF frequently results in a compromised nutritional status due to significantly increased energy needs, malabsorption of fat, distressing digestive symptoms and lack of appetite. 

 We \( **R04**\) evaluated the evidence on eating behaviours and interventions, highlighting a lack of evidence based knowledge and practice in adult eating behaviours and the need for evidence based research to inform interventions to support optimal nutritional intake. 

 This qualitative study \( **R05**\) **highlighted the amount of time and cognitive effort in self\-regulating eating**; strategies to reduce effort included avoiding food preparation, easy to swallow foods, reliance on crisps and chocolate and distraction techniques to eat sufficient calories. Eating lacked pleasure, was viewed as another treatment to endure, and created high anxiety due to concerns that fluctuating health would result in weight loss and exacerbate symptoms of CF. 

 We investigated the link between emotional eating and BMI in PwCF \( **R06**\). Higher levels of emotional eating significantly predicted higher BMI, which is often desirable, but an increase in levels of emotional eating is not due to its negative effects on mental health. Mindfulness and mindful eating moderated this relationship, suggesting their utility for creating an eating intervention that supports both improved physical and psychological outcomes.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CF care presents a difficult challenge for clinicians, and patients, and resources are typically focused on managing physical symptoms. Clinicians report having little psychology experience and knowledge, and clinical psychologists have limited resources which are focused on serious mental health issues. The research team collaborated with HCPs to develop interventions based on our research for use by the wider clinical team, with a view to improving psychological support in HRB and eating behaviours. 

 We created three tools: 

-  Encouraging discussions regarding HRB: A toolkit to identify patients at higher risk of non\-adherence and HRB 

-  A Guide to Mindful Eating for PwCF 

-  Mindful Eating Practices for PwCF \(CFMEP\) 

 **A toolkit to identify patients at higher risk of non\-adherence and HRB** 

 We identified that, in the UK, there are no current national standardised practices for embedding HRB information into CF care; this is undertaken retrospectively when individuals flag that they are already engaging in HRB. We developed a psychological screening tool to be completed by patients with an accompanying guide for HCP, which aimed to identify PwCF who were at risk of engaging with HRB, including non\-adherence, as a means of coping with their CF. 

 The screening tool was introduced to CF Specialist Nurses at a UK national CPD training day, promoting discussion and debate and raising awareness around the increasing prevalence of HRB. The screening tool was evaluated as being user friendly and useful addition to clinical practice for detecting patients at risk of engaging in HRB. 

 The screening tool was piloted with a small number of patients and gained a positive response \( **S01**\); of the 8 participants who responded to the questionnaire, 6 strongly agreed that the tool would be relevant to them. Everyone agreed that the format was fit for purpose, user friendly and would encourage discussion with clinicians improving patient experience and clinical practice, for example: 

 *I think it looks really straightforward to understand and would be really useful. Our clinic doesn't use anything like this, and it would be great if they did.* 

 *Easy to understand and covers a range of topics that could be covered to help us with Cystic Fibrosis discuss ways in which we could get help from. I like that the form is filled out before a clinic appointment so that you can get your thoughts down on paper first without the pressure or anxiety of opening up to someone first.* 

 Clinicians from The West Midlands Adult CF Team now use the HRB screening tool as part of their annual review with patients, as our research suggested that new modular therapies to treat CF increased the risk of engagement in HRB as improvements in symptoms reduced the salience of risk associated with HRB. During the COVID pandemic, clinical care was moved online but clinicians continue to help PwCF identify their HRBs and this helps clinicians know what HRBs their patients are engaging in \( **S02**\). 

 **A Guide to Mindful Eating for PwCF and Mindful Eating Practices for PwCF** 

  

 The need for Eating Behaviour Interventions specific to the needs of PwCF was highlighted by the clinical team at West Midlands Adult CF centre \( **S02**\). We developed the ‘Guide to Mindful Eating for PwCF’ and 3 CF specific Mindful Eating Practices based on evidence from our research studies. Initial versions were shared with Specialist CF Dieticians at a national CPD event and promoted discussion around the need for changes in practice to include psychological interventions such as mindful eating. Lack of knowledge in mindful eating and CF specific needs were identified as barriers to implementation. 

 The guide and tools were trialled with dieticians \(N=12\) \( **S01**\) and PwCF \(N=9\) \( **S01**\). 8 dieticians completed the questionnaire and consented to have their response included in the REF submission. Prior knowledge of mindful eating was reported as ‘no knowledge’ \(2\), ‘slight knowledge’ \(4\) and ‘moderate knowledge’ \(2\). Everyone reported increased knowledge after reading the guide with 5 reporting ‘moderately knowledgeable’ and 3 ‘very knowledgeable’.  The tools were evaluated as useful, easy to use, and implementable in clinical practice: 

 *“This is exactly what is needed, theory and knowledge on mindful eating alone would not make me fully embrace this with patients but with this tool I would feel more confident.”* 

 “*Easy to understand, quite intuitive to use \[…\] Definitely useful to help understand food choices etc*” 

 Our ‘guide to the psychology of eating behaviours for people living with Cystic Fibrosis’ provided information to clinicians with limited existing knowledge on this topic, and along with our tools, was used to identify the most effective ways of using elements of mindful eating behaviours to support individuals with their specific needs. 

 Overall, 8 PwCF consented to have their data included in the REF submission. On initial evaluation, all agreed that the guide was easy to understand and that the tools would be helpful in practice. 

 *“It was really good to understand mindful eating and to know about this”* 

 “*It was honestly extremely interesting and I will definitely be implementing it a lot more.”* 

 Four PwCF were asked to engage with using the tools over a period of two weeks \( **S03**\), all reported that their knowledge of mindful eating had increased and 3 people reported that they had incorporated elements of the tools into their eating practices and found them helpful in identifying unhealthy eating patterns and eating a more varied diet: 

 *“The timetable diary of the food I’m eating clearly shows the pattern on how I consume food that isn’t healthy as a habit”* 

 *“I had started to think about eating better due to diabetes and weight gain this just gave me another tool in the box”* 

 **Overall changes in clinical practice** 

 Clinicians have noted that their practice of care has been improved as a result of proposals put forward by the research team. For example, the clinical psychologist the team worked with noted: 

 *“Using the **evidence based, collaborative research** produced over a number of years, the team made several proposals **for improving care which have been adopted by clinicians**. These have included improving knowledge of HRBs amongst clinicians and incorporating the HRB questionnaire into annual reviews with patients”* \( **S04**\) 

 Additionally, the same clinical psychologist noted that: 

 *“The research collaboration and the tools which have been created on the basis of the research conducted by Egan, Keyte and Mantzios influenced the way **we offered care for adults** with Cystic Fibrosis, particularly with how **we approached discussing engagement in health risk behaviours** and eating behaviours. The research demonstrated that some patients felt that there was a lack of clear information provided on the specific impact of HRB’s on CF and **this is now** **made more explicit by HCPs on our team**. Raising awareness of the gap in knowledge with our team was an important step in **improving practice to identify patients at risk** of engaging in HRBs and providing them with specific information on risks to enable patients to make more informed decisions regarding their health behaviours”* 

 The lead respiratory consultant noted: 

 “*the **research conducted by the team at Birmingham City University helped us provide a greater level of care** at the West Midlands Adult CF Centre. The research and the outcomes that our collaboration was able to achieve has clear implications for other health practitioners in their on\-going treatment of adults with CF*”. \( **S02**\) 

 The work of Egan, Mantzios, and Keyte has therefore influenced clinical practice in terms of how HCPs deliver their care for PwCF. Additionally, the research has helped PwCF identify their own HRBs, which in turn helps HCPs to provide more guided and tailored healthcare advice.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Davies’ research has benefitted diverse groups of users, from prisoners to playwrights and novelists. Classes based on his book *City of Gangs* led to increased engagement in education at HMP Barlinnie and HMP Low Moss \(2019\). Both prison education classes and creative adaptations of Davies’ work have been reinforced by the frequent use of his research by journalists and by television production companies in historical dramas as well as documentaries. Through his own media appearances, but especially through the use of his findings by prominent cultural commentators such as the hip hop artist, Akala, Davies’ work has substantially informed public understanding of gangs and ‘knife\-crime’. His research has also been commercially exploited by businesses ranging from a clothing manufacturer to a marketing agency. Through these wide\-ranging activities, users in multiple sectors—both regionally and nationally—have benefitted from Davies’ research. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Davies explored the nature and extent of gang formation and conflict in three case studies: Manchester and Salford \(1870–1900\), Birmingham \(1870–1900\) and Glasgow \(1918–39\). His research revealed that in all three conurbations gangs were the subject of intense concern among civic and religious leaders, judicial authorities, social reformers and journalists. Clear patterns in gang formation emerged from Davies’ research. In late Victorian Manchester and Birmingham, territorial youth gangs emerged throughout the ‘factory districts’ that ringed the city\-centres \(3.1; 3.5\). Conflicts were most intense in ‘slum’ districts, such as Ancoats in Manchester, where youths with few economic prospects acquired considerable prestige through their reputation for fighting prowess \(3.5\). 

 Davies uncovered a different pattern of gang formation in interwar Glasgow. Whereas Manchester’s late Victorian ‘scuttlers’ and Birmingham’s ‘peaky blinders’ tended to be aged in their mid\- to late teens, Glasgow’s street gangs included many men aged in their twenties or even thirties. Davies attributed this to two factors: the sectarian basis of gang formation in Glasgow, especially in the city’s East End, where gangs purportedly existed to ‘protect’ processions by local churches and organisations such as the Orange Order; and mass, long\-term unemployment, which saw gang members resort to property crime and ‘protection’ rackets from the mid\-1920s. The rivalry between the Rangers and Celtic football clubs – identified as ‘Protestant’ and ‘Catholic respectively – reinforced sectarian tensions in Glasgow. The most powerful of the city’s Protestant gangs, the Billy Boys, were avid Rangers supporters. They also provided stewards at Unionist \(Conservative\) Party election meetings \(3.2; 3.6\). 

 Five key research findings were articulated in the activities detailed in Section 4, below: 

 • Current concerns with gangs and ‘knife\-crime’ are not new. To portray these phenomena as unprecedented is misleading, and fosters shallow explanations of their causes. Davies’ case studies show that gangs were clustered in districts characterised by high levels of poverty, unemployment and ill health. Gangs must be understood in the contexts of economic deprivation and social exclusion \(3.1; 3.5; 3.6\). 

 • Contrary to claims by some modern politicians and high\-profile media commentators, gangs are not a by\-product of the growth of black communities in Britain’s cities; nor can they be attributed to the influence of new forms of music such as ‘drill’. Gang formation and conflict are more deeply rooted than these racialised discourses imply \(3.5; 3.6\). 

 • Mass imprisonment failed to curb the spread of gangs or the use of weapons. Many gang members served serial prison sentences \(3.2; 3.5; 3.6\). 

 • The most successful attempts to combat gangs hinged not on penal sanctions, but on the provision of new opportunities for sport, education and training for youths in poor districts. These initiatives were most successful in late Victorian Manchester, where the working\-lads’ club movement received substantial donations from employers and philanthropists. ‘Pals’ Clubs’ enjoyed similar, if more limited, successes in interwar Glasgow \(3.5; 3.6\). 

 • Sectarian gangs such as the Bridgeton Billy Boys played a significant role in local politics and sport in Glasgow, as well as in communal disturbances in the city’s tenement districts. Their leaders, notably Billy Fullerton, were prominent figures in civic life, with reputations that extended far beyond the neighbourhoods in which the gangs were based \(3.2; 3.3; 3.4; 3.6\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Inspiring learning and creativity in prisons 

 The use of Davies’ book *City of Gangs* in classes at HMP Barlinnie and HMP Low Moss grew out of a partnership between Glasgow’s Mitchell Library and the Scottish Prison Service \(SPS\). Confident that Davies’ research would interest prisoners, the Principal Librarian for Reader Development at the Mitchell arranged for Davies to give a talk to 60 prisoners at Barlinnie in 2014 \(5.1\). A follow\-up session with a prison reading group and creative writing class was attended by the Head of Learning and Skills for SPS. His feedback inspired the programme of classes based on *City of Gangs* delivered by Davies at the two prisons in 2019. The Head of Learning and Skills facilitated this with the Area Manager for SPS’s education provider, Fife College. 

 The Education Team Leader at Barlinnie described the outcomes of this programme as “remarkable” \(5.2d\). The immediate change she noted was the increased engagement in education that resulted directly from the programme: “I am so impressed at how well the guys have engaged with both yourself and the topic and all the \[tutors\] have said how motivated the guys are to come and contribute which \(and trust me when I say this from many years’ experience\) is no easy task and does not always happen\!” \(5.2a\) The Education Team Leader showcased the programme at Fife College’s annual staff conference in September 2019 as an example of successful innovation in prison education \(5.2d\). 

 The beneficiaries of the classes delivered by Davies were the resident tutors and six groups of learners \(four at Barlinnie: 36 men in total; two at Low Moss: 44\), who worked with Davies over four weeks in August 2019. The groups read *City of Gangs* and examined legal files and press reports used in Davies’ research before analysing these sources in their own essays. Learners at Barlinnie used their participation in Davies’ classes to complete 140 qualifications, ranging from personal development awards to SQA Level 4 History ¬\(5.2e–g\). One class was inspired to produce a magazine, ‘The Auld Team’, for fellow prisoners. This contained extracts from Davies’ sources, a student essay and paintings by a prison art class \(5.2m\). 

 Resident tutors reported that participants in Davies’ classes gained increased confidence as well as critical reading and listening skills. Feedback from learners and tutors testified to exceptionally high levels of engagement \(5.2a–n\). Attendance at Barlinnie was over 80% \(5.2d; normally 50%\). Classes at Low Moss were relocated due to demand: double the number of anticipated learners arrived for Davies’ first session. One tutor who worked alongside Davies at Barlinnie described learner engagement in these classes as “amazing” \(5.2e\). She commented that learners were “surprised by their ability to read such a factual book,” adding that their confidence grew over the course of the programme \(a comment echoed by all of the tutors involved\). She noted that her group had shared information about the classes, and their copies of *City of Gangs*, around the prison’s halls, generating interest among prisoners who did not participate in education and boosting her own efforts to stimulate recruitment \(5.2e\). 

 This was echoed at Low Moss, where a group of men visited the prison’s Learning Centre for the first time to attend one of Davies’ classes. The Area Manager for Fife College reported that: “The men who attended from \[this\] Hall, 6 in total, never leave the Hall due to acute mental health issues. They heard about the project from their regular tutor and were keen to get involved. Coming to the Learning Centre to hear Andrew was a significant achievement for the men, who overcame their own personal issues to engage with the class” \(5.2i\). 

 In addition to these educational classes, Davies worked for four weeks with a ‘work party’ of ten prisoners to serialise the life story of the leader of the Billy Boys \(one of Davies’ key sources\) for Barlinnie’s radio station, ‘Barbed Wireless’. The Radio Tutor reported: “It’s only occasionally that we get projects to work on that can involve several students at once, and they’re always invaluable as they help facilitate team building skills, amongst others. Your project was arguably the best that we’ve worked on—everybody, bar none, got involved with different aspects, from reading & recording passages to making adverts and the eventual finished feature. It really helped them to develop their skills, both as team players and on their own initiative … it’s been great to give them a real project to work on” \(5.2h\). Feedback from the work party stressed their enjoyment of the project—a significant response given their prior experiences of education \(every member of the group had been excluded from school\). The ‘life story’ approach prompted the work party to reflect on their own experiences, and to view their own stories as worth recording. Learner evaluations were extremely positive \(“I got inspired by the book, it gave me the motivation to write my own book so I took a lot in”: 5.2n\). Responses to the broadcasts among the wider prison population were “very positive” \(5.2h\). 

 Reviewing Davies’ project, the Head of Learning and Skills for SPS identified learners “critically reflecting on their own experiences” as a key benefit \(5.2l\). The project has had a lasting legacy: Davies’ material has been embedded in the history curriculum at Barlinnie and continues to be used by the radio work party. The prison’s Education Team Leader is eager to re\-run the project once COVID restrictions are lifted \(5.2j–k\). 

 Inspiring and informing television documentary and drama 

 *The Secret History of My Family* episode on ‘The Salford Scuttlers’ \(BBC 2, 2016; 1,230,000 viewers: 5.3e\) was derived from Chapter 14 of *The Gangs of Manchester* \(“We have thoroughly enjoyed reading your book”; “It has really opened up another avenue of enquiry for us”: BBC Researcher, 5.3a–b\). Davies acted as consultant for the episode \(5.3d\). Davies’ account of Glasgow’s Billy Boys and their leader, Billy Fullerton, in *City of Gangs* provided the creative springboard for the fictional portrayal of the Billy Boys in series 5 of *Peaky Blinders* \(BBC 1, 2019\). The Assistant Script Editor at Tiger Aspect Productions told Davies that the production team had relied heavily on his account \(5.3f\): “your book was so incredibly useful during the preliminary research stages\!” 5,900,000 UK viewers watched the Billy Boys’ first appearance in the series \(5.3g\). The broadcast of series 5 of *Peaky Blinders* further boosted interest in Davies’ educational classes at Barlinnie and Low Moss. Learners in both prisons used their new historical knowledge acquired from *City of Gangs* to critique the television drama in conversations with fellow prisoners. As one member of Barlinnie’s radio work party observed: “Much truth can be changed around for TV” \(5.2n\). This encapsulates the critical thinking among participants in Davies’ classes, repeatedly noted by the resident tutors. 

 Inspiring and informing creative works and commercial uses 

 *The Gangs of Manchester* informed a host of creative works, including a novel and two commercial theatre productions. *Angel Meadow* \(2014\) by ANU productions was commissioned to launch HOME, Manchester’s new theatre, cinema and arts complex. Cast members developed their characters directly from Davies’ research. One of the actors told the *British Theatre Guide* that Davies’ book was “the first thing I got hold of” when researching his part: “I focused on one character in the book … *The Gangs of Manchester* was a great help” \(5.4b\). Angel Meadow sold\-out \(1,800 tickets: 5.4c\), won ‘Best Production’ and ‘Best Ensemble Production’ at the 2015 Manchester Theatre Awards \(5.4d\), and was described by the *Daily Telegraph* as “too fierce to dismiss … a superb piece of programming” \(5.4e\). Director Louise Lowe was nominated for ‘Best Director’ at the 2014 UK Theatre Awards \(5.4f\). 

 *Scuttlers*, by award\-winning playwright, Rona Munro, was commissioned by Manchester’s Royal Exchange Theatre Company and performed in 2015 \(39 performances; total audience: 18,589: 5.5c\). Munro centred her script on Chapter 9 of *The Gangs of Manchester*, acknowledging her debt to Davies’ research \(5.5a\), while Davies wrote an 1,800\-word companion piece for the programme \(5.5d\). Along with the cast and production team, Munro joined a guided walk based on Davies’ book \(devised and led by a Manchester tour guide: 5.5j\). Subsequent productions of *Scuttlers* \(2015–17\) include: City & Islington College; RADA; Wakefield Theatre Royal; Dublin Academy of the Arts; and North East Scotland College \(5.5e–i\). ‘Scuttler Gangs of Manchester’ tours attracted 700 participants \(Oct. 2013–2019: 5.5j–m\). 

 Novelist Emma Hornby acknowledged her reliance on *The Gangs of Manchester* when researching her fictional account of scuttlers, *Manchester Moll* \(2017\). She confirmed \(5.6\): “your book was the only in\-depth work I have come across on the subject … You really bring the era, the people and emotions, to life in your book and give a real sense of the time. Works such as your\[s\] are invaluable to novelists.” Commercial uses include a range of t\-shirts by clothing manufacturer, Good Measure \(2016: 5.7a–b\), while White Rabbit Creative, a design and marketing agency, announced their relocation to new offices in 2017 by creating prints “based around the scuttlers theme” \(and acknowledging their use of Davies’ research: 5.7d\). 

 Enhancing public understanding through broadcast and social media 

 Davies’ work has been widely discussed on social media, amplified by Davies’ own media appearances. His *BBC History Extra* podcast on ‘peaky blinders’ \(2019\) attracted 119,701 listens. His related article on Glasgow’s Billy Boys for the *History Extra* website was viewed 35,067 times \(5.8a\). The hip\-hop artist, Akala, has been a prominent user of Davies’ research, repeatedly citing both *The Gangs of Manchester* and *City of Gangs* when discussing gangs and ‘knife\-crime’ on Twitter and on television \(5.9a–g\). He uses Davies’ findings to show that these are not ‘black’ problems, since they pre\-date the growth of black communities in Britain’s cities. He cited Davies on Channel 4 News in 2019 \(5.9d\). An interview segment tweeted by Channel 4 attracted 2,400,000 viewers, 25,924 retweets and 52,352 likes \(5.9f\). Akala retweeted it to his own 211,700 followers, citing Davies’ books. One follower responded: “The \[mainstream media\] love to fetishize black on black crime like \[it’s\] something particularly unique to our dna. The Glasgow point destroys that whole agenda stone dead\!” \(5.9g\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Minimally invasive endovascular surgery is quicker and safer for patients; however, it comes at the cost of exposing the patient to high doses of harmful ionising radiation and kidney\-toxic contrast agents. Researchers at King’s College London \(King’s\) have developed a cloud\-based, artificial intelligence\-driven image guidance system \(Cydar\-EV\) for endovascular surgery, which minimises exposure to radiation and kidney\-toxic contrast by shortening the duration of surgery. 

 Cydar\-EV has the European Union \(EU\) certification mark for health and safety standards, is Food and Drug Association \(FDA\) cleared, and has been commercialised in the UK, Europe, and the USA by Cydar Medical, a spin\-out company of King’s College London. Cydar Medical has benefitted approximately 2,000 patients \[Text removed for publication\] by December 2020. Since 2014, the company has raised approximately \[Text removed for publication\] and in July 2020 it had 39 employees across the UK, Europe, and the USA. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Minimally invasive procedures are revolutionising the management of cardiovascular diseases, which has previously been dominated by open surgery. Endovascular aortic repair \(EVAR\) is a successful example of this, and it has replaced open aortic surgery owing to advantages in patient survival, reduced postoperative complications, and shorter length of hospital stay. 

 EVAR planning is done using high\-resolution 3D images from pre\-operative CT scans; however, the surgery itself is performed under image\-guidance using 2D X\-ray fluoroscopy. This loss of dimensional spatial information between 3D pre\-operative images and a 2D operating field makes the operation more complex to perform as the surgeon must try to visualise the 3D anatomy to accurately position the device. This slows down the procedure and leads to three challenges: 

1.  Concern regarding the amount of ionising radiation, which is associated with the duration of the procedure 

1.  Concern regarding the amount of kidney\-toxic contrast used during the procedure to delineate the blood vessels 

1.  Imprecise visualisation of the anatomy and positioning of the device leading to high rates of re\-intervention \(≥20%\), requiring further patient hospital admissions and cost to the health service 

 The School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Science at King’s has devised methods to align 3D computed tomography \(CT\) images and 2D X\-ray images. Previous solutions to improve visualisation during EVAR include manually aligned, operating table\-tracked 3D\-2D image overlay; however, this is costly, disrupts the clinical workflow, and has clinically significant image positioning errors. 

 The King’s\-developed image guided surgery system matches CT and X\-ray images based on their similarity and automatically links the images using a process called image registration. The technology has been proven to be fast, accurate, and robust. The technology has been developed in a step\-wise fashion based on advancement in image processing and matching \(R1\) to automation in the endovascular clinical environment \(R2\), thereby increasing the speed of registration \(R3\) and improving the accuracy of the matching algorithm \(R4\), with full automation and verification of accuracy in the specific use case \(R5\).The system is now cloud based to take advantage of the high compute power infrastructure available, allowing the technology to run quickly and smoothly at multiple hospital sites simultaneously, with 2,000 patients treated to date. Machine learning algorithms have been developed in\-house and are used for increasing the speed of 3D image segmentation, contour generation for intra\-operative guidance, and image matching. 

 The system has been tested in interdisciplinary clinical studies involving engineers, mathematicians, and clinicians. This work has shown patient benefit by a significant reduction in the amount of X\-rays used, with a mean reduction in X\-ray fluoroscopy screening time of 35% \(p = 0.013\), a 41% reduction in the amount of iodinated contrast used \(p = 0.008\), and a nearly one\-hour reduction in mean operating time \(17%, p = 0.06\) \(data submitted for EU certification mark \(MHRA ref: 5334\)\[S7\]\). Superiority to commercial competitors \(Siemens Artis Zeego\) was demonstrated, with a significant reduction in radiation exposure \[S1a\], with significant clinical and technical improvements shown compared to standard practice in studies in both the UK and US \[S1b, S1c, S1d\]. 

 The development and automation of the image registration technology was funded by Guy’s and St Thomas’ Charity \(GBP183,500, 2010–2013\), with subsequent funding from Innovate UK \(GBP250,000, 2014, 2018\) and approximately GBP18,000,000 in equity funding tranches \(2014–2020\) to develop the product, collect clinical data in a pivotal trial, gain regulatory clearances \(CE, FDA, TGA\), and build the platform, along with operational and support capabilities. 

 The National Institute for Health Research have awarded GBP1,740,000 \(NIHR201004\) this year to fund a trial to investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness of **Cydar\-EV** \(the name of the product from Cydar Medical\) compared to the current reference standard: 2D X\-ray fluoroscopy. The trial will run for 3 years and the data will be used for an application to The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) for appraisal. A positive report from NICE would support national adoption of the technology.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Image\-guided, minimally invasive surgery is growing rapidly. The global market for EVAR is approximately GBP2,000,000,000 \[S10\], with a compound annual growth rate of 6.2% and is an increasing burden on health spending. 4,396 EVAR procedures were performed in UK alone between 2017\-2019 \[S11a, S11b\], with an average cost of approximately GBP19,000. EVAR is under an existing NHS care pathway and reduces mortality from 4.7% to 1.7% compared to open surgery \[S13\], with faster return to normal activities on discharge. 

 **Enterprise:** The demonstrated success of the technology led to the development of the King’s spin\-out company Cydar Medical in 2012. Since 2014, Cydar Medical has raised \[Text removed for publication\] and by July 2020 had 39 employees across the UK, Europe and the US, in science, development, sales & implementation and central, with approximately 2,000 patients having benefitted in the current REF period \[S5\]. The system has been installed and is in regular clinical use \[Text removed for publication\] across the UK \(8\), France \(5\), US \(5\), Germany \(2\), Netherlands \(1\) and Spain \(1\). The product has undergone safety and performance testing under an ISO13485 certified Quality Management System and is CE marked \(MHRA ref: 5334, CE conformity application dated November 20, 2015\) and FDA 510\(k\) cleared \(dated: July 7, 2016\). 

 **Cost and efficiency improvement for NHS:** Cydar\-EV can be easily implemented without the need for linked capital expenditure on a new fixed imaging or hybrid operating room, which is associated with cost\-saving across 6 NHS centres of approximately GBP21,000,000 \(GBP2,000,000–GBP5,000,000 per centre \[S12\]\) and in the 12 centres worldwide, approximately GBP42,000,000. Use of Cydar\-EV is associated with a reduction in procedure time that has health economic benefit by improving productivity, allowing one additional aneurysm repair per day, valued at GBP8,157 per procedure \[S4\]. 

 **Benefit to patients:** Over 2,000 patients have been treated by 2020 using Cydar\-EV. In sites where Cydar\-EV is installed, the surgeons have real\-time, fully integrated 3D visualisation throughout the EVAR procedure, with much greater spatial accuracy than was achieved by previous technology \(median error 3.9 mm versus 8.64 mm \[p = .001\]\). This means less kidney\-toxic contrast is used during the procedure \(41% reduction with Cydar\-EV \[p = 0.008\]\) to position the device accurately \(data submitted for EU certification mark \(MHRA ref: 5334\) \[S7b\]\). 

 **Benefit to medical staff:** Many of the early pioneers of X\-ray guided endovascular surgery died due to cancer\-related causes. Operators today may perform thousands of these procedures during the course of their career. In our installations there has been a reduction of 31% in the number of X\-rays used, hence reducing the chance of radiation\-induced disease \[S1\]. In words of some users: Cynthia K. Shortell of Duke University Medical Center in the US said: “It has been an instant, blockbuster hit with everyone involved in these procedures. Every operating room participant has a story about the way Cydar technology benefits our team\-shorter procedures, lower radiation, less contrast agent, and much greater accuracy.” Dr Peter Goverde, ZNA Stuivenberg Hospital, Belgium said: “This will expand extensively the possibilities of our mobile C\-arms and reduce contrast and radiation exposure\!” \[S9\]. 

 **Intellectual property:** The computer vision is a form of artificial intelligence, which uses NHS Digital\-approved, GDPR compliant, high\-performance cloud computing. Patents have been granted protecting the 2D\-3D image registration \(China, EPO, Japan, the USA\) and tomosynthesis imaging \(the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, the USA\) \[S2\]. In the period between August 2013 to December 2020, King’s has received reimbursement of patenting expenses incurred, amounting to GBP14,548.67 \[S6\] 

###  **In summary,** Cydar is the first company in the world with a CE marked, FDA\-cleared product using cloud and AI technology to inform and influence surgery in real\-time \[S8\]\[S7a,S7b,S7c\]. There are traditional imaging companies that use hardware to achieve less accurate and reliable image fusion, but these are not considered competitors as they do not aggregate data, and therefore, cannot develop the same intelligent insights and channel for new products. In recognition of its pioneering work, Cydar was the winner of the Cambridge Business Innovation Award and runner\-up for Cambridge AI Company of the Year in 2018 \[S3\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Cambridge’s REAL \(Research for Equitable Access and Learning\) Centre has led to shifting global policy and funding priorities towards supporting education from the early years and for children disadvantaged by poverty, gender, disability and location. As a result of research findings on educational access and learning, it has secured aid commitments notably by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office \(FCDO \-formerly the UK Department for International Development \- DFID\). 

-  Specifically, the REAL Centre’s work has: influenced DFID’s 2018 Education Policy and investment, including GBP 20,500,000 on research and GBP500,000,000 to reach 1.9m marginalised girls; 

-  successfully campaigned for a Sustainable Development Goal indicator on minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics; 

-  shaped global advocacy on education for children with disabilities; 

-  prompted the government in Ghana to commit 1% of its education budget to a Complementary Basic Education programme affecting 450,000 children; and 

-  enabled CAMFED in Tanzania to raise GBP18,000,000 in funding for 51,100 marginalised children, particularly girls.

 **2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

 The REAL Centre has adopted a systematic approach to engaging policy and practice by working in partnership with organisations and individuals in sub\-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Partners have jointly defined, planned, implemented and analysed the research to promote its uptake. For example, the REAL Centre worked collaboratively with research partners in Pakistan on the Teaching Effectively All Children project to influence government policy on inclusive education \[S9\]. 

 Adopting a multi\-disciplinary approach using quantitative and qualitative methods, REAL Centre research highlighted that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, including the poorest girls and children with disabilities, face serious risk of not completing primary school. Even for those who do make it through primary school, many are not learning the basics in literacy and numeracy \[R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R8\]. The research identified that timely and appropriate intervention through pre\-school and early primary years education has important benefits for children’s learning, particularly for the most marginalised. This requires greater public investment in these early years. 

 REAL Centre evidence, including from analysis of a large\-scale citizen\-led assessment dataset in Pakistan \(ASER\) has shown that children with disabilities are often least likely to attend school, and once there, often face additional obstacles to learning \[R8\]. In countries such as India and Pakistan, where parents and teachers are able to provide the resources and support to their education, children with disabilities have opportunities to learn, including in mainstream government and private schools \[R4\]. 

 REAL Centre evidence, including from analysis of a large\-scale citizen\-led assessment dataset in Pakistan \(ASER\) has shown that children with disabilities are often least likely to attend school, and once there, often face additional obstacles to learning \[R8\]. In countries such as India and Pakistan, where parents and teachers are able to provide the resources and support to their education, children with disabilities have opportunities to learn, including in mainstream government and private schools \[R4\]. 

 Alternative approaches to education are needed for many children who do not complete primary school. In Northern Ghana, the REAL Centre’s research on the Complementary Basic Education programme found that many of its participants improved their literacy and numeracy significantly within a year and made a successful transition back into the formal primary school system \[R2, R3\]. 

 For those who do complete primary school, targeted approaches are needed to give them the opportunity to transition to secondary school. Evidence from the REAL Centre’s work with the NGO CAMFED in Tanzania showed that reaching marginalised girls requires multi\-dimensional approaches. This costs more but can have considerable impact on school retention and learning \[R7\]. 

 The REAL Centre’s approach places engagement with policymakers and aid agencies at the heart of its research priorities. This model recognises that policymakers often require a body of evidence beyond individual studies. Work undertaken by the REAL Centre has therefore synthesised research on a variety of topics related to education disadvantage \[e.g. R6\]. Moreover, in her role as Senior Research Fellow role at DFID \[2015\-2017\], the REAL Centre’s Director, Professor Pauline Rose, was embedded in the work of the Department for three years. This led to continuous exchange about bodies of evidence to inform policy and aid commitment decisions. Her role also enabled professional development and learning opportunities for DFID staff to embed research in their own evidence\-based decision\-making. 

 During the Covid\-19 pandemic, the REAL Centre, in collaboration with researchers in Ethiopia and Rwanda, has undertaken phone surveys to understand the effects of COVID\-19 from the perspective of teachers, headteachers and parents, particularly for the most disadvantaged learners. These surveys have been developed in consultation with government and donors in both countries, and has informed their planning including for school re\-opening. Rose and Sabates have advised FCDO’s Building EdTech Evidence and Research on the design and analysis of surveys to understand the impact of school closures on learning in low\- and lower\-middle income countries. Singal was invited to co\-author an international Response Note on disability and education during COVID19 with the World Bank. Sabates’ research on identifying learning loss due to school closures in Northern Ghana has been shared with the Ministry of Education to inform strategies for enhancing distance learning during the pandemic. 

 The impact described is a result of this working model of exchange and dialogue, and engagement by Rose and the team at the REAL Centre in carrying out new research along with evidence syntheses of benefit to the policy objectives of FCDO, the broader international development community, and national governments.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on global funding** 

 Research by members of the REAL Centre was influential in the design of DFID’s 2018 Education Policy, *Get Children Learning* \[S2\] and subsequently influenced funding decisions in a number of ways. As Senior Research Fellow within DFID, Rose summarised evidence, including REAL Centre research, prompting DFID’s Education Policy \(2018\) to focus on targeted interventions to address intersecting disadvantages, such as related to poverty, gender and disability. This led to investment of an additional £500m to reach 1.9m of the most marginalised girls, as part of DFID’s *Leave No Girl Behind* programme \[S1\]. 

 Analysis by Alcott and Rose showing that learning gaps start from early childhood \[R6\] was included in the policy \[S2\]. This influenced a spending commitment of GBP20,500,000 on research to inform early childhood education programming. As DFID’s Chief Scientific Adviser acknowledges, “ *REAL Centre evidence pressed us to focus on tackling the learning crisis for the early years by supporting the most disadvantaged children to learn the basics of literacy and numeracy. This is one of DFID’s key contributions to achieving the vision set out in Sustainable Development Goal 4 of inclusive and equitable education and lifelong opportunities for all”* \[S1\]. 

 The REAL Centre submitted written evidence to the International Development Committee \(IDC\)’s report on DFID’s programme *Leaving No One Behind in Education*, further influencing DFID’s policy. Rose’s oral evidence to the Committee was later quoted by the IDC in a letter to Priti Patel \(then Secretary of State of DFID\) and to her successor, Penny Mordaunt: *“We have heard particularly compelling evidence… including \[from\] the University of Cambridge… to suggest DFID should be spending far more on early childhood education”* \[S3\]. According to the IDC Chair, *“The REAL Centre’s rigorous, policy\-relevant research was helpful in highlighting that intersecting disadvantage, associated with poverty, gender, disability, and where a child lives, needs to be tackled from the early years.”* Stephen Twigg MP, IDC Chair, August 2019 \[S4\]. He goes on to conclude: *“This recommendation was successful and early years education is now a cornerstone of DFID’s 2018 Education Policy, resulting in increased investment for this crucial stage in a child’s education.”* \[S4\]. 

 **Global policy impact** 

 Collaborating with the charity Theirworld, the REAL Centre highlighted how little governments and donors invested in early childhood education \[S5\] *.* This work was referenced in the 2016 UNICEF’s flagship report ‘State of the World’s Children: A fair chance for everyone’ \[S7\]. Save the Children CEO, Kevin Watkins wrote, *“The education section of State of the World's Children drew almost entirely on REAL analysis…which has reached a global audience of policy\-makers”* \[S6\]. This REAL Centre evidence influenced UNICEF’s 2019\-2030 Education Strategy, and its commitment to spend 10% of its education budget on early childhood education. Sarah Brown, Chair, Theirworld reported that *“The REAL Centre…has played an unprecedented role in using data and research to drive forward policy change in global education focused on early childhood development”* \[S5\]. 

 REAL Centre research proved the need for an indicator within Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\) on achieving a minimum proficiency level in reading and mathematics by Grade 2 or 3 – essential for monitoring children’s learning from the early grades of schooling. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics \(UIS\) described the work as ‘pivotal’ in the push for monitoring early learning \[S8\]. 

 Singal’s research has shaped global advocacy on education for children with disabilities \[S9\]. Through leadership on the ESRC\-DFID’s Impact Initiative, Singal collaborated with over 30 organisations to prepare a Statement of Action. This promoted evidence\-based approaches to inform a focus on inclusive education at the first Global Disability Summit, hosted by DFID in July 2018 *: “This collective Statement of Action was used extensively…to build momentum and capture commitments within the Global Disability Summit’s Call to Action \[and\] was instrumental in the establishment of the Inclusive Education Initiative, hosted by the World Bank, including a commitment of £4.7 million by DFID”* \[S1\]. 

 **National impact** 

 In Ghana, the Complementary Basic Education \(CBE\) Programme had been funded by aid organisations. Sabates and colleagues used longitudinal, quantitative analysis to show how the CBE programme was improving access and learning for some of the country’s most disadvantaged children. This evidence persuaded the Ghanaian Government to commit to funding the programme: *“Thanks to the robust evidence, 1% of the government’s basic education budget has been promised to support the continuation of the programme from 2019.”* This funding supports around 450,000 of the most disadvantaged children in Ghana \[S1\]. 

 In Tanzania, REAL Centre analysis of the cost\-effectiveness of CAMFED’s educational programme used large\-scale, quantitative data to show that, while it costs more to reach marginalised girls, the impact of keeping these girls in school is substantial. *“…the evidence generated has been instrumental in enabling CAMFED to raise new funding to support the education of marginalised girls at secondary school. Over 2018\-20, this has included institutional grants to the value of £18m, which will benefit 51,100 marginalised children to improve their retention and learning at secondary school, including financial support for 16,200 of the most marginalised girls to complete a full cycle of secondary school education*.” \[S10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Centre for Syrian Studies \(CSS\) research identified the causes and dynamics of the Syrian civil war and ways of ameliorating it. Through sustained engagement with the UK government and international organizations, CSS research informed debates and helped shape policy concerning intervention, diplomatic strategy, and reconstruction aid. CSS also engaged in extensive media outreach to provide needed context for the general public to understand the complexities of the crisis. Specifically, CSS research findings: 

-  Informed foreign policy debates within the UK government, from November 2013\-2017, cautioning against intervention and focusing instead on humanitarian aid and diplomacy—recommendations that were ultimately congruent with adopted policies of refraining from military involvement and raising the UK’s humanitarian assistance profile. 

-  Improved crisis diplomacy at the United Nations by encouraging more engagement with local Syrian actors and avoiding zero\-sum measures, an approach largely adopted by the second UN Special Envoy from 2014\-2019. 

-  Emphasized the danger of continuing conflict by economic means in reconstruction efforts, leading the World Bank and the United Nations to recommend conditioning reconstruction funding on inclusivity by the Syrian government in their 2018\-2020 reports. 

-  Interpreted the crisis for the public, from November 2013\-2020, via sustained engagement with live radio and tv media outlets reaching large global audiences \(e.g. BBC Scotland, France24, Turkish TRT World, Arabic Euronews\), including 23 interviews since 2018. Recorded appearances were further distributed via the Centre’s webpage and complemented with blog post analysis, with downloads of individual videos reaching up to 15,000 views.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2011, mass protests broke out in Syria, demanding greater political freedoms and government aid in a time of deep economic struggle. What began as peaceful demonstrations, by 2012, had rapidly devolved into repression, violence, and ultimately a civil war with extensive international intervention. The Centre for Syrian Studies \(CSS\) reoriented its research to respond to this evolving crisis—and the widespread and pressing need across governments and international organizations to better understand the conflict and how it might be ameliorated. CSS research stood out, among an emerging body of recommendations initially dominated by advocacy groups and non\-specialists, for its scholarly approach and longstanding expertise in Syrian politics and history. The Centre’s research findings focused on three key aspects of the conflict: its root causes and drivers, the obstacles to effective international response, and planning for reconstruction during an eventual post\-conflict peace\-building phase. 

1.  **The root causes and drivers of the Syria conflict** 

 Beginning in 2011, CSS research explored the origins of the conflict and mapped the roles of key domestic actors, both within the regime and the opposition. Research findings traced how the secular non\-violent protest movement was marginalized, leading to civil war instead of democratic transition. Especially important to this outcome were the Asad regime’s use of violence against protestors, defections from the army, and the arming of the opposition by external regional actors **\[R1, R2\]**. Research findings further demonstrated how these international interventions became competitive, leading to proxy wars that prolonged the conflict, raised its costs, and drove increasing sectarianism \(e.g. divisions between religious communities\). As security dilemmas deepened between communities, by 2013 the country had fragmented into rival zones of regime and rebel governance, overlapping with spheres of external influence **\[R3, R4\]**. 

1.  **Obstacles to an effective international response** 

 CSS research also examined the policies of key states and international organizations toward the conflict, specifically analysing the obstacles to an effective response, the dangers of inadvertently aggravating the crisis, and how these might be overcome. For example, economic sanctions and the invocation of human rights norms \(e.g. the ‘Responsibility to Protect’\) tended to raise expectations of full\-scale international intervention, thereby dissuading all sides from a compromise settlement. Covert interventions, wherein external patrons armed and funded local proxies, led to widespread expectations of continued resources and support that further prolonged and deepened the conflict **\[R3\]**. CSS research also examined UN diplomacy, finding that UN mediators had little leverage because none of the conflict parties could imagine co\-existing with their adversaries or had any incentive to negotiate. The US and Russia were unprepared to pressure their clients into compromise and key actors were also excluded from talks, notably Iran **\[R5\]**. 

1.  **Post\-conflict peace building and reconstruction** 

 After 2015, global attention turned to the possibility of a post\-conflict period in which a vast reconstruction effort would be necessary. CSS research identified the context in which reconstruction would necessarily occur and identified obstacles to its success. Most importantly, the research highlighted the exclusion of local actors and the zero\-sum approaches through which the Syrian regime and foreign states were making reconstruction a continuation of the conflict by economic means. It highlighted how ordinary Syrians were the victims of this power struggle, including through the redistribution of property from opposition to loyalist actors by the Syrian government and the blanket US sanctions designed to inflict maximum pain as a prelude to regime change. Research findings also explored how the international community could come together and design reconstruction efforts to overcome this competition, by making increments of reconstruction assistance conditional on the government’s adoption of more inclusive reconstruction approaches and pushing back against blanket sanctions. Initially delivered to the commissioning agencies in 2018\-19, these findings were ultimately published in 2020 **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 Throughout the Syria crisis, from November 2013\-2020, CSS research on the root causes of the conflict, the obstacles to an effective international response, and the prospects for reconstruction were actively solicited by the UK government, United Nations, and World Bank. Through sustained engagement with these beneficiaries, CSS research findings informed important national and international debates over intervention, diplomacy, and reconstruction. —shaping adopted policies and recommendations. Moreover, CSS engaged in extensive media outreach, providing much needed context and information for the general public. Specifically, CSS research findings: 

-  cautioned the UK government against intervention and recommended focusing on humanitarian aid and diplomacy—advice congruent with the policies ultimately adopted; 

-  encouraged the United Nations to engage more extensively with local Syrian actors and avoid zero\-sum measures, an approach adopted by the second mediator; 

-  shaped World Bank and UN ESCWA policy recommendations on reconstruction aid to condition incremental funding release on inclusivity by the Syrian government; and 

-  provided important contextualization of the complex crisis for the general public via sustained media engagement. 

1.  **Informing UK policy debates and response to the Syria crisis** 

 CSS research explicitly sought to break through the highly polarized discourse over Syria and provide a deep grasp of the roots of the crisis while also exposing its multi\-sided complexity and intractability **\[R1, R2\].** Research findings cautioned against intervention, which could aggravate the crisis, and instead suggested focusing on diplomatic efforts and humanitarian assistance to conflict\-affected Syrian communities **\[R3, R5\]**. 

 Between 2013 and 2017, advice based on these research findings was regularly conveyed to UK government officials, informing evolving policy debates. Such consultations included with MI\-5 \(November 2013\), the Prime Minister’s Office \(October 2015\), the Foreign Affairs Committee \(October 2015\), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(July 2016\), and gatherings of senior military officers \(April 2016; February 2017\). According to the FCO Deputy Head of Research Analyst’s section \(and in charge of Syria\), the Centre has “ *consistently contributed to the policy debates on Syria within government throughout the past five years*”, with its conferences and published volumes, “ *essential aid to understanding of the conflict”* **\[S1\]**. In testimony to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, the Centre director underlined how the Islamic State was being utilized by regional actors such as Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia to advance their own interests **\[S2, pp.14\-15\]**. The chair of the committee acknowledged this testimony was *“extremely useful in setting out the international players and their interests”* \(in the Syria crisis\) and as a basis for their questioning of the Foreign Secretary **\[S3\]**. CSS was also invited in April 2014 to make a submission on humanitarian assistance to the International Development Committee, advocating that DFID pursue a new UN Security Council resolution that would grant access to Syria for humanitarian agencies and foster local partners. The UK’s relative caution in refraining from most military involvement in the Syrian crisis combined with its higher profile in humanitarian assistance is consistent with the analysis and advice provided by the Centre. 

1.  **Improving crisis diplomacy at the United Nations** 

 CSS research further identified measures that could facilitate movement toward conflict resolution, specifically on how to improve crisis diplomacy. The UN International Peace Institute and Office of Political Affairs jointly solicited a study from the Centre on the efforts of the UN Syria mediators. The research findings recommended more balanced engagement with all stakeholders while avoiding zero\-sum approaches that would damage the vital interests of any side **\[R3\]**. The resulting report was downloaded over 500 times \( [https://www.ipinst.org/wp\-content/uploads/2016/03/IPI\-Rpt\-Syrian\-Crisis2.pdf](https://www.ipinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IPI-Rpt-Syrian-Crisis2.pdf)\). It has become one of the most read IPI papers and, in the words of a UN official, is “ *a controversial report, because it speaks boldly about a very sensitive subject \[but, being\] authored by two of the foremost experts on Syria and on mediation, the conclusions were able to withstand the criticism… \[It is\]* *the finest example of first\-rate academics applying their knowledge to the policy world.*” **\[S4\]** 

 As a result, the subsequent mediator, the Special Envoy for Syria of the United Nations Secretary\-General *,* “ *engaged more…with local Syrian actors*” **\[S5\]**. The Special Envoy’s political advisor also acknowledged that the work of the Centre had provided “ *many insights valuable to my work…* *Raymond Hinnebusch and myself had some stimulating conversations about the ingredients of successful UN diplomacy in the Syrian case, including impartiality and inclusivity, from which we both profited and which helped inform our views in our various capacities. Also,* \[they\] *produced a valuable study of the diplomacy carried out by* \[the previous mediators\] *which helped inform our thinking under the subsequent UN mediator*” **\[S5\]**. With a national level political settlement apparently out of reach, the Special Envoy turned to sponsoring localized de\-escalations of violence. The Centre was then invited by the Berghof Foundation on behalf of the Finnish Foreign Ministry to research similar de\-escalation agreements elsewhere, with a view to supporting these new efforts in the Syrian context **\[S6\]**. CSS identified considerable variance in context between local communities, especially the particular balance of power between factions within them, suggesting the need for decentralized solutions. Research findings also highlighted the strong potential for the regime to concede to localized solutions and power\-sharing based on their own manpower shortages. 

1.  **Emphasizing inclusivity within United Nations and World Bank reconstruction recommendations** 

 CSS research findings emphasized ameliorating the consequences of the crisis via broadly inclusive humanitarian assistance and reconstruction efforts that avoided continuing the conflict by economic means **\[R4, R6\]**. From 2018\-20, the Centre engaged extensively with both the World Bank and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia \(ESCWA\) to develop best practices and actionable recommendations for Syrian reconstruction. The resulting reports reflected the Centre’s advocacy of more inclusive reconstruction and concern with blanket sanctions. 

 CSS signed a memorandum of understanding with UN ESCWA to collaborate on two studies of the Syrian conflict:  [*Syria at War: Five Years On*](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-war-five-years) \(2016\), which examined the damage to Syria’s economy and need for much increased humanitarian relief, and  [*Syria at War: Eight Years On*](https://publications.unescwa.org/projects/saw/index.html) \(2020\), which identified the political obstacles to reconciliation and reconstruction. The reports directly incorporated CSS research findings: advising powerful external actors to use their leverage over conflict parties to nudge them toward more inclusive strategies of reconstruction. An ESCWA official attested that its partnership with CSS had been *“strategic and synergistic”* and the joint work, widely disseminated, had had “ *a major impact on policy\-makers and stakeholders in building awareness and consensus*” **\[S7\]**. 

 The World Bank similarly commissioned CSS to provide research on the geo\-political context of Syrian reconstruction \[R6\], as part of its “Building for Peace in the Middle East” \(https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/mena/publication/building\-for\-peace\-reconstruction\-for\-security\-sustainable\-peace\-and\-equity\-in\-the\-middle\-east\-and\-north\-africa\) initiative—which was disseminated to government policymakers in order to build consensus on a pathway forward **\[S8, pp. ix, 15\]**. The research findings showed how reconstruction had become a continuation of conflict by other means, as part of the proxy wars being waged on Syrian soil by foreign governments and recommending making reconstruction aid incremental and conditional on demonstrated inclusivity by the Syrian government **\[R6\]**. CSS researchers presented their findings at World Bank workshops in June and October 2018 and in a final 20,000\-word report, published in March 2019 and formally launched on 15 July 2020 with a virtual event attended by more than 5000 people worldwide \(with a condensed version published in *Global Policy* in 2020,  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758\-5899.12779](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-5899.12779)\). The project manager affirmed that the *“excellent research of the centre…helped the Bank to better articulate its thinking on reconstruction, peace\-building and transition toward sustainable peace in the Middle East…* \[and\] *directly fed into the major report and recommendations on reconstruction and its operational applications* **\[S9\]**. 

1.  **Interpreting the crisis for the “attentive public” through the media** 

 Dr Omar Imady, as Centre Outreach Officer, was regularly involved in conveying CSS research findings in the public sphere. From November 2013\-2020, he appeared regularly on live broadcasts that reached millions of viewers around the world \(e.g. BBC Scotland, France24, Turkish TRT World, Arabic Euronews, and Australia’s ABC News\). Videos of many of these broadcasts, 23 since 2018, were posted on the Centre’s website \( [https://www.inspired\-by\-syria.com/media](https://www.inspired-by-syria.com/media)\) with individual downloads per video ranging from 1,000 to 15,000 views **\[S10\]**. A Blog by CSS staff and fellows also provided regular interpretation of developments in the conflict \( [https://www.inspired\-by\-syria.com/blog](https://www.inspired-by-syria.com/blog)\), with 6,671 people \(viewers\) visiting 16,849 times in the last year alone \(between 2019 and 2020\), a significant level of traffic given the extended length of conflict and general public focus on the pandemic. This commentary helped clarify the complex issues in the conflict for the attentive public.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research on digital consumer culture, customers’ satisfaction and service quality, has influenced the strategic decision\-making and marketing communications environment at Three UK. The telecommunications and internet service provider which is ranked in the Top 4 of market share holders among mobile operators, had commissioned Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli to prepare a technical report on the impact of speed on consumers’ switching intentions in the UK mobile telephone industry in September 2016. Three UK subsequently used the research to reinforce their own assessment of speed and to revamp their advertising campaigns which had a direct influence on the creation of their 2018 and 2019 television commercials for mobile phones. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Dey \(then, Senior Lecturer\) and Dr Al\-Karaghouli of Brunel Business School have conducted extensive research on digital consumer culture, customers’ satisfaction and service quality. \(Ref. 2; Ref. 3; Ref. 4\). Dr Dey’s work conceptualised and theorised digital consumer culture \(Ref.5\) and explored and analysed consumers’ interaction with and appropriation of digital technology \(Ref.6\) 

 Their most recent research project concentrated on the role speed plays for UK mobile telephone customers \(Ref. 1\). 

 Mobile telecom is a highly competitive industry where each operator’s products are seen as only partial substitutes for other providers’ products. Mobile operators try to retain and grow their customer base through differentiated products and services that have multiple attributes. As a result, a wide range of factors may influence customers’ assessment of mobile telecom services and in turn influence their decision to remain or switch. It is important for operators and policy makers to know which factors influence a customer’s decision to remain with and switch from their existing provider as the cumulative effect of this type of decision will have a major impact on competitive dynamics. 

 In addition to basic product features such as quality of voice calls and text messaging services, customers are likely to value other features such as data network coverage and speed of Internet access. However, it is not clear from the existing literature whether internet speed on mobile telephones has any influence on customers’ service satisfaction and subsequent switching decision. This lack of clarity inhibited mobile telephone service providers’ marketing strategies and endeavour to offer and promote appropriate service features. Even if they attempted to highlight speed as a decisive factor, due to a lack of academic research regulatory bodies such as Ofcom, did not properly recognise their claims. This was the case when Ofcom blocked Hutchison’s \(widely known as Three Mobile\) campaign geared towards investigating whether in the changing market environment consumers take notice of speed which in turn affects their perception of the brand and value of the network provider. 

 After Ofcom’s evaluation, Three UK commissioned Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli in September 2016 to produce independent academic research to test the impact of speed on consumers’ switching decisions in the UK mobile telephone industry. Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli took a marketing perspective and developed a conceptual framework from critically analysing the extensive review of the relevant academic literature that selected on consumer behaviour, branding and electronics engineering \(Ref. 1\). 

 The research findings showed that customers rate speed as the second most significant component of service quality after call quality, when choosing a mobile telecom provider. Their data also confirmed that brand image is positively associated with speed and a significant driver in the creation and maintenance of a company’s perceived value among mobile telephone customers.

 Meeting the high competitions and the rapid consumers’ demand for the wide use of smartphones and increasing subscription to high speed data networks, there is a predictive trajectory of customers’ growing reliance on Internet\-mediated services and facilities. A 2016 Ofcom report on ‘Coping in the connected world’ suggests that 9 in 10 adults in the UK go online every day and indicates that smartphones and tablets offer the most convenient means for being connected with the Internet world. A 2020 ‘UK Mobile Phones Market Report’ from Mintel, one of the largest market intelligence agencies globally, estimates that the UK smartphone market was worth GBP6,520,000,000 in 2019. Providers within the UK mobile telephone industry therefore continually determine how consumers choose providers \(e.g. based on speed and coverage\) in order to keep up in a competitive market and growing userbase. The measures are required to stay ahead of competitors, acquire new customers and retain existing customer base by achieving customer satisfaction through high quality products and services. 

 Three UK carries 36% of the UK’s mobile data traffic and is the fastest growing network in the country which covers more than 97% of the population. With approximately 10,100,000 active customers who use over 3.5 times more mobile data than the industry average, they are one of the most popular mobile telephone providers in the UK. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research outputs in the form of the project report and published article were submitted to Ofcom to reconsider their initial decision of blocking Three’s campaign. Although the outputs did not make significant changes in Ofcom’s position, the documents were widely used by the Three management. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research findings informed the ways in which Three engages with regulators. The Senior Strategy Manager of Three confirms, that the report “validated our initial assumptions that in the changing market environment consumers pay increasing attention to speed which in turn contributes to their perceptions of the brand and value of a network provider” \(E1\). 

 Three subsequently used the document as a point of reference for their current and future strategies, which increasingly recognise the importance of speed. While remaining compliant to Ofcom, the report produced by Dr Dey and Dr Al\-Karaghouli has improved the quality of discussion at Three. Prior to the report, Three was unsure whether their own assessment, which showed that it is worthwhile putting speed to the forefront, was accurate. However, the research “reinforces and concurs with our own assessment of speed,” says the Senior Strategy Manager, and it has convinced them to stick to their existing operational strategy \(E1\). Importantly, it also influenced their decision to make speed a core part of their strategic decision\-making and marketing communications. 

 Three used the research findings to enhance their brand image and customers’ perceived value, and discourage them from switching to a competitor. For example, they have made both call quality and speed key aspects of their marketing communications in order to grow their position in the UK mobile telecom industry. 

 Three’s recent advertising campaigns highlight the importance of customers’ perceived value underpinned by the call quality, brand image and network speed. Their 2018 TV ad ‘Phone History \#PhonesAreGood’ “for instance has strong indication that speed has significant impact on consumption experience” \(E1\). It also comically depicts how major historical events could have been alleviated if only the people at the time had had a good smartphone with excellent speed by their side \(such as the Captain of the Titanic successfully circumnavigating the iceberg and Henry VIII averting any unfortunate marriages with the means of a dating app\). Likewise, the 2019 TV ad ‘The Switch | Switch to Three’ advertises the high influence of call quality on consumers when depicting a customer at sea with perfect reception on her mobile phone. 

 Dr Dey’s and Dr Al\-Karaghouli’s research have informed the strategic decision\-making process and marketing communications at Three UK, a company that ranks in the top 4 mobile operators that hold the biggest market share in the country. Three UK confirms that they “plan to make further progress with our partnership with Dr Dey, Dr Al\-Karaghouli and Brunel University London to explore and apply further implications of the research” \(E1\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Jon Dovey led four major collaborative knowledge exchange projects worth GBP15,500,000 in total. These projects enhanced sector growth, leading to the creation of 73 jobs, 40 companies, and over GBP9,200,000 in further investments. This was achieved through research into how universities and cultural organisations can facilitate connectivity in the creative economy, and demonstrated the importance of supporting cultural, social and economic outcomes. This approach enhanced the capacity of creatives and 224 creative companies to become more confident, resilient and sustainable. The model of knowledge exchange developed and refined by these projects has influenced the design of international development schemes and national funding programmes. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Dovey and Moreton’s work has critically re\-examined how value is produced in creative networks and ecosystems through formal and informal interactions, and how the consequences of these interactions produce different intensities and scales of impact. 

 **Redefining value in creative exchanges**Dovey’s \(2009\) practice\-based arts and media research \( **R1**\) argued: 

 *‘judgements about knowledge exchange value could be made in terms of the health of any given system rather than the immediate use value of any single component with it’* \(p62\) *.* 

 This re\-conceptualised the role of practice\-based research within emergent knowledge exchange contexts, recognising the multiple forms of social, cultural and economic value, and impacts in collaborative research. This work was consolidated in the evidence gathered for the Cultural Value Networks report \( **R2**\), which used the UWE\-sponsored Pervasive Media Studio \(a creative technology lab for creatives and academics run by Watershed in Bristol\) as a case study to identify how supporting cultural and social as well as economic value leads to enhanced creative outputs. These findings underpinned the delivery mechanism for the Research and Enterprise in Arts and Creative Technology \(REACT\) project \( **G1**\). 

 **Rethinking creative economies as ecologies**This understanding was developed in an article for *Cultural Trends* \( **R3**\), which analysed how value is produced and mobilised. **R3** underpinned the design principles of the Network for Creative Enterprise \(NfCE\) project \( **G2**\) – a Watershed/UWE\-led project to enable creatives across the West of England to make a sustainable living from their ideas, by directly embedding a focus on the importance of the value exchanges that underpin creative ecosystems. **R3** further underpinned **G3** and **G4**, programmes that fund R&D in the creative economy by focusing on the importance of network building and supporting cohort learning. Two papers by Moreton, **R4** and **R5**, and one report by Dovey \( **G5**\), argued that to occupy the role of facilitating anchor institution in a creative economy ecosystem successfully, universities needed to recognise the full range of multiple values and interactions involved and to resist applying conventional econometric measures. These insights underpinned Creative Producers International \( **G6**\), an international creative leadership scheme run by Watershed. 

 **Creative hubs: co\-developing practical and conceptual methods with creative organisations to support the creative ecology**This rethinking of the politics of value in creative innovation networks, led to a research commission \( **G7**\). The output \( **R6**\) argued for the importance of creative hubs, defined as organisations that offer creative businesses the 

 *‘chance to aggregate with others in order to access crucial resources such as tools, specialist services, or inspiration to help develop projects and businesses’* \( **R6** p4\). 

 The research demonstrated how hubs offered 

 *‘a collective approach to coping with uncertain social, cultural and economic environments and processes of creativity and innovation’* \(ibid\), 

 which helps strengthen and sustain creative ecologies. Those mobilised collective resources gave rise to a range of impacts from ‘jobs, new products and services, to talent development, regional talent retention, informal education and engagement, training, urban regeneration, research and development, new networks, innovative models of organisation, quality of life enhancements and resilience’ \(ibid\). **R6** also underpinned the NfCE project \( **G2**\), where creative microbusinesses were attached to cultural hubs that most reflected their values, which enabled exchanges of expertise, assets and effective business development support.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Enhancing creative sector growth**REACT and NfCE led to the creation of 40 companies and 73 jobs, contributing to sustained growth and employment in the sector \( **S1** p2; **S2** pp8\-9\). REACT specifically stimulated GBP5,353,569 in external investment in projects – from private investment, new research funds, to product sales and commissions \( **S1** p2\). REACT’s support led to one participant securing further investment of GBP3,800,000 to found a new company, Sensible Object, which launched an international product in 2017, leading to its acquisition by a US tech firm in 2019 \( **S3**\). REACT also enabled participating companies to create 76 pieces of software, 86 prototypes and products and 262 distinctive assets \(knowledge, skills, IP, business models, services\), thereby improving their reputation, income, and market share. For example, REACT funding enabled the product design agency Kinneir Duffort to develop a new prototyping process: 

 *‘The result, a wearable camera for mums and babies, designed and prototyped within 4 months, \[which\] was viewed by 2.5million people in a campaign with Huggies consumers in Korea at the end of 2014’* \( **S1** p7\). 

 **S4** demonstrates that UWE’s co\-development with Watershed of the ‘creative hub’ model of development enabled Watershed to expand its creative delivery team from two to eight, thereby increasing the capacity of a regional organisation to support national and international ecosystems such as in Australia, Ireland, Japan, Khazakstan, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and USA through **G6**. It also enhanced Watershed’s ability to articulate and evidence its approach to supporting the creative ecology, which underpinned its role in securing GBP13,000,000 of funded projects \( **S4**\). 

 **Supporting creatives**REACT and NfCE aggregated creative talent through cohort learning, which encouraged the cross\-pollinations of ideas, approaches and skills, leading to more connected, resilient ecosystems. In particular, the programmes offered bespoke support to 175 creative participants through over 600 hours of training and coaching \( **S2**\). This increased confidence and sector knowledge, providing new skills and developing expertise that enhanced companies’ market offer: 

 *‘The tailored business support has helped the transition from … being a sole founder of a company, to taking on another person and working together to change from design consultancy to now publishing our first augmented book.”* \(NfCE Resident, **S2** p27\). 

 This change is also reflected in the testimony given by NfCE Residents in the video \( **S5**\). 

 REACT and NfCE connected 224 businesses, affording peer\-led opportunities for individuals and companies to secure paid work, through freelance commissions and PAYE employment \( **S1** p2; **S2** pp8\-9\). This enabled creatives to take risks and experiment and help develop sustainable livelihoods that would otherwise have been beyond their capacity: 

 *‘without REACT, I wouldn't have made some of the most daring projects I've ever made or have the opportunities regionally, and nationally, that I have today’* \( **S1** p26\). 

 REACT’s pastoral support for individuals growing businesses, combined with peer support from the networks, gave participants the confidence to find new stakeholders that increased stability: 

 *‘\[the support of NfCE has\] allowed me to grow as a designer and become confident and more independent allowing me to build my client base and network’* \(NfCE funding recipient, **S2** p29\). 

 **Influencing funding infrastructures G7** had international impact by improving the British Council’s understanding of UK creative hubs, enabling them to codify and export their approaches internationally: 

 *‘the emphasis on values within each hub’s unique fingerprint was a really fruitful way of \[addressing\] very different kinds of hubs within a common framework’* \( **S6**\). 

 This allowed British Council to develop connections, policy and funding work in Ghana, Turkey, Uganda, and Ukraine. 

 The Dowling Review \(2015\) singled out REACT as an example of how creative hubs operate as an effective means to support collaboration between businesses and university researchers in the UK \( **S7**, p38\). This model of knowledge exchange led to the University Alliance commissioning *The Hidden Story* \( **S8**\), which emphasised the volume of creative/HEI interactions in the UK, and made recommendations to policymakers to use diverse mechanisms to support and capture the multiple values in play in creative work and ecosystems. 

 The development of the AHRC’s Creative Economy strategy \(2016\) was informed by our work, demonstrated in the programme design for its GBP80,000,000 ISCF\-funded Creative Industries Cluster Programme. This impact is corroborated by the former Executive Chair of AHRC \( **S9**\) and reflected in the AHRC’s report *Creative Exchanges* which explicitly repeats our core findings that 

 *‘Creative clusters and networks are particularly important for a sector largely made up of agile freelancers and small and micro businesses … which, leads to increased business activity as well as the development of new businesses’* \( **S10**, p.7\).

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted within the Department of Space and Climate Physics at UCL has had a significant impact upon Teledyne\-e2v Ltd \(T\-e2v, formerly e2v\), a manufacturer of charge\-coupled devices \(CCDs\). Through working collaboratively with T\-e2v, UCL has helped the company to secure major contracts and business with a total value of more than \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] since 2013. This includes a contract for the supply of CCDs for the European Space Agency \(ESA\) mission PLATO \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\]. Furthermore, the symbiotic relationship has contributed to the establishment of T\-e2v as Europe’s leading supplier of high\-quality CCDs for space science applications and has underpinned an improved understanding of device design and optimisation within the company.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Department of Space and Climate Physics \(also known as the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, or MSSL\) at UCL includes an Instrument Science Group that develops high\-specification cameras for use on scientific spacecraft and undertakes fundamental research in the field of imaging sensors, including CCDs. CCDs are optical sensors that take the form of a two\-dimensional pixelated array. They have revolutionised the acquisition of image information; for example, modern digital cameras are based on devices of this kind. The success of scientific applications is often critically dependent on the precise response of CCDs in their expected environment. For space science applications, this environment is a satellite operating in the harsh conditions of space. 

 The MSSL group has worked closely with CCD manufacturer e2v Ltd, \(T\-e2v from 2017\) for many years on a programme of CCD characterisation and modelling \( **R1\-R5**\). This partnership 

 involves the detailed design and manufacture of CCDs by T\-e2v, followed by the scientific evaluation and characterisation of the devices in specialist facilities at MSSL. This characterisation is within the context of performance and process models, and includes aspects such as noise sources and electron mobility, diffusion and loss. Test data are simulated and interpreted to quantify underlying device properties, and device performance is estimated. The models that are used have been either developed at MSSL or adapted from those in the published literature. The results and evaluations from the research at MSSL informed T\-e2v’s next generation of devices and their optimal use. The programme has so far involved the characterisation of more than 300 T\-e2v’s CCDs. 

 The collaborative studies function within a virtuous circle in which research insights relating to the improvement of CCDs are shared and understanding builds from project to project. Insights that have resulted from the programme of research are in areas including the physical processes of the devices, such as electron mobility and diffusion, noise sources, linearity, electron loss mechanisms, sensitivity, temperature dependence and set voltage dependence; camera design optimisation; device specification; and CCD data interpretation \(calibration\) during data analysis. For example, the MSSL group showed how linearity of response could be increased beyond full\-well capacity through pixel integration, and the point spread function dependency on wavelength gave an insight into the electron diffusion in the drift region of the CCDs. 

 Much of this CCD research was conducted as part of studies of future space mission concepts, of which there are many more than actual space missions, due to the way that technical risk is mitigated, and selections are made. Such studies are very comprehensive and are often competitive against other mission concepts. The lists of studies that MSSL has been involved with that have led to improved understanding of CCDs is presented in Table 1. 

 In many of the projects, a customer that is an expert in detector technology was involved, working with MSSL to optimise mission performance \(for example, Lockheed Martin for GOES SXI \( **R1**\) and Hinode FPP; and ESA for Eddington \( **R2, R3**\), Euclid, Gaia \( **R4, R5**\) and PLATO\). The mode of collaborative working through customer\(ESA\)/supplier\(T\-e2v\)/science groups \(including MSSL\) working groups developed for Gain proved highly effective for Euclid and has been adopted for PLATO \(chaired by Professor Smith at MSSL\). 

 For actual flight missions the emphasis was on device specification, device characterisation, identifying optimal operating conditions, screening and preparation for exploitation. Important developments that have formed part of this work include the examination of back illumination in CCDs that had been thinned to create extreme ultraviolet sensitivity, \( **R1**\) and the evaluation of novel concept L3CCDs \(a new type of CCD\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 MSSL research has underpinned improved performance of T\-e2v devices. Since 2013 it has enabled the company to win major contracts, led to improvements in its CCD technology, and enhanced its standing in the space market. The e2v relationship with MSSL and UCL has been one of the foundations of T\-e2v space science imaging business \( **S1**\). 

 <ins> **Improved commercial performance</ins> <ins>and competitiveness</ins> <ins>of T\-e2v**</ins> 

 The success of space missions is critically dependent on the performance of the CCDs, since their main data product is the output from these devices. Hence, reliability of the CCD devices and their performance are of utmost importance to space agencies and sponsors of space missions. 

 The primary beneficiary of MSSL’s body of research is T\-e2v Ltd., a UK\-based company that develops a range of innovative technologies including CCDs. The company employs 1,600 people, roughly a third of whom are scientists and engineers. Its annual sales were approximately GBP147,000,000 in 2018. 

 \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] The Gaia and Euclid missions have included the largest and second largest CCD focal planes ever built for space, with 109 and 36 CCDs, respectively. Including 26 cameras, the PLATO mission is equipped with 104 large CCDs and will be the largest number of pixels used in a detection system \(>2,000,000,000,000\), twice that of Gaia, the record holder before PLATO. 

 MSSL’s engagement with T\-e2v has also enhanced the company’s standing in the competitive space market and has assisted them “in becoming Europe’s dominant and preferred supplier of CCDs for space science applications” \( **S1**\). Indeed, the track record that T\-e2v has secured as a result of the research collaboration, is unrivalled. “The enhanced reputation and improved capability that this experience has built at T\-e2v has made possible for the company to be a credible supplier to the next ESA science missions”. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] 

 \( **S1**\). 

 <ins> **Improved understanding of space missions requirements and technical capabilities**</ins> 

 In addition to enhancing T\-e2v’s reputation and helping them to secure large contracts, “the symbiotic relationship between the company and MSSL has led to an improved understanding at T\-e2v of mission science requirements and their implications for CCD design” \( **S1**\). The insight that the MSSL team have brought to T\-e2v on the mission science requirements and how these translate into CCD performance needs, have enabled them to better understand how to design and optimise detectors for particular applications. The company acknowledged these insights as “invaluable in allowing \[them\] to address other customers with similar requirements and being able to offer solutions rather than simply asking questions” \( **S1**\). T\-e2v stated that “in this high technology marketplace this \[understanding of space mission requirements\] is a very strong selling point” \( **S1**\). 

 T\-e2v note that “the strong technical liaison between MSSL and the Lockheed Martin Solar Physics group, enabled them to supply CCDs into several programmes from SXI on GOES, to all of the Hinode instruments, the HMI and AIA instruments on the Solar Dynamics Observatory” \( **S2**\). Through this, the company has built its experience and capabilities for Solar Imaging. As a result, T\-e2v has been able to “address requirements for NASA Explorer Mission IRIS \(the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer\), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory \(STEREO\) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Solar Ultraviolet Imager” \( **S1**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Greece has not seen any substantial engagement with family history to match the upsurge of interest in genealogy in Western Europe and North America. This is because online searchable family history resources are rare and underdeveloped, as is advice and guidance on how to undertake family history. Hionidou’s research, which utilises and nominally links civil registration and census records, has addressed this gap. She created and provided for free a searchable database embedded in a website that offers both the data itself, and advice and guidance for users. School lessons which she devised, as well as public talks that she delivered enabled pupils, teachers and the wider public, both Greek and from the Greek Diaspora, to learn how to research family history. Further, Hionidou’s research has changed the practices of the General State Archives of Greece and the commercial genealogical organisation *Ancestry*. These developments have been important not only in shaping heritage and educational practices, but also they have strengthened, among both pupils and adults, individuals’ and communities’ sense of identity. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Violetta Hionidou’s research explores the demographic and social history of modern Greece. The research underpinning this case study comprises a prize\-winning monograph utilising oral history methods plus a series of journal articles and chapters investigating the history of families and households in 18<sup>th</sup>, 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup>\-century Greece. This research relied on the collection of many oral histories \(PUBS 2, 4 and 5\) but also Hionidou’s collation of 49,833 records of individual nominal census records organised in households in 18<sup>th</sup>\- and 19<sup>th</sup>\-century Greek island populations \(PUBS 1, 2 and 3\). Such nominal censuses, of which the originals are deposited in dispersed Greek and British archives, had been inputted into a number of databases as part of Hionidou’s work. Hionidou’s research involved linking records from different sources, thus identifying individuals at different moments in their lives \(PUBS1 and 3\). 

 Hionidou’s findings have included the dominance of nuclear households among those populations, showing that the overwhelming majority of people spent their lives in a household with their own biological family \(PUBS2 and 3\). However, the research has also revealed the mechanisms of support that existed *across* households with, for example, daughters or granddaughters supporting the elderly mother or grandmother who resided on her own but in close proximity to them \(PUB2\). In other instances, grandparents would support their adult children by temporarily incorporating them, or one of their grandchildren, into their own household \(PUB2\). Among farmers, despite the independent residence of each family unit, economic links between married adult sons and their fathers persisted, in some cases for much of their adult life; in other cases for only a short period of time \(PUBS2 and 3\). Such findings challenge the close focus of research on residential patterns and emphasize the, often invisible, connections of support among non\-cohabiting family members in times of hardship. In other instances, more significant changes were observed, such as an increase in complex households \(PUB1\) or significant re\-organisation of the household unit when families were faced with the prospect of becoming refugees \(PUB5\). Such mechanisms were particularly important and were utilised in times of personal or economic crisis depicting strategies of resilience and agency at the level of family. Migration of women\-as servants and men in search of employment was a constant dimension in the lives of the people, whenever it was possible \(PUBS1, 2, 4, 5 and 6\). The research informs how everyday life was organised in residential and economic terms from the eighteenth to the mid\-twentieth centuries in Greece. 

 This research connects individual family histories with local and national history. It also closely resonates with several central preoccupations of Greek society today, including questions of family, women’s employment \(PUBS2 and 6\), migration \(PUBS1 and 2\) and, increasingly, issues of displacement and the status of refugees \(PUBS4 and 5\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 2016\-17, with the support of ESRC IAA funding \(GRANT1\), Hionidou combined, harmonised and adapted 9 of her research databases in order to develop a single database suitable for and accessible to a public audience. The 49,834\-record database was built by Data Architects Ltd and overseen by Hionidou. The database and search function were embedded within a custom\-made website called **GreekFamilyHistory** \( [https://apps.ncl.ac.uk/GreekFamilyHistory/Page/Home](https://apps.ncl.ac.uk/GreekFamilyHistory/Page/Home)\). Hionidou provided a comprehensive introduction, in both Greek and English, on *how* to conduct family history with Greek sources, one of the first of its kind. Hionidou authored all the editorial material, distilling her research knowledge on Greek family history, and examining major questions of history with reference to today’s Greek and Greek diaspora populations, including family structures, women’s employment, migration and displacement. After a trial period, the website received its official public launch in March 2019. 

 Building on the online availability of these data, Hionidou undertook a sustained campaign to introduce, explain and encourage engagement with the resource. She **reached individuals** in Greece and the Greek diaspora, both young and old, encouraged them to explore their own past and make sense of it by linking it to local and national history. She empowered individuals and communities to enhance their identity and access their intangible heritage through the performance of family history. Moreover, Hionidou **changed practices** in genealogy organisations, Greek archives, libraries, community groups, and schools, assisting them to offer to their users new ways of engaging with archives and local history. 

 <ins> **Impacts on individuals and communities</ins>** 

 \(a\) Making data and historical contextual information widely available 

 Since its formal launch in March 2019, Hionidou’s database and search facility have been used by a global audience numbering in thousands. Through the press, and social media channels, chiefly Facebook and Twitter, persons of Greek ancestry, living across the world were made aware of the website and have since employed and benefited through its use, having located previously unknown ancestors \(IMP2c, IMP8a\-c, IMP8e\). This possibility was simply not available before to most users. The significance of the resource was recognised by the way in which it has been taken up by the world’s major, and most well\-used, genealogical organisations. The non\-profit *FamilySearch*, operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\-day Saints and the largest genealogical organisation in the world, has added a link to the GreekFamilyHistory website in its  [GreeceGenealogy](https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Greece_Genealogy) Wiki page, an acknowledgment of its significance for Greek family history \(IMP10a\). The General State Archives of Greece \(hereafter GSAG\) has added a link to the GreekFamilyHistory website, similarly acknowledging its importance \(IMP9a\). So too several local libraries, such as the Korais library on Hios \(IMP6f\). Likewise, in collaboration with Hionidou, *Ancestry,* the largest commercial genealogy company in the world with 3 million paying subscribers, has incorporated select fields of the GreekFamilyHistory database to its own search engines, allowing its clients to identify Greek ancestors and subsequently to link these back to the GreekFamilyHistory to obtain further information \(IMP10b\). Google analytics show a sustained engagement with the GreekFamilyHistory site, involving 3,452 users \(of which 3,148 are new users\) with 22,829 page\-views between March 2019 and December 2020 \(IMP7\). 24% of users originate in Greece, 40% in USA while the remainder are mostly from Australia \(IMP7\). For those already engaging in family history, the database and website have been received as an important new source of information. Representative comments include: ‘Great resource\! I spent hours last night browsing through everything. Thank you for posting.’; ‘Thank you for sharing this information…it’s wonderful\!’ \(IMP2c\). US users commented through Facebook on the extreme usefulness of this new resource that enabled them to trace multiple ancestors \(IMP2c\). 

 \(b\) Dissemination to and effects on user groups 

 Besides simply providing the data, Hionidou undertook a programme of work to present the database to local libraries and community centres, both in Greece \(e.g. Mykonos Kousathanas Library, Municipal Hermoupolis Library, November 2019\) and major centres of Greek descent populations in North America \(e.g. Joliet IL, November 2019\). Attendance was approximately 150 at each event \(IMP6d\-e, IMP5e, IMP2d\). These events went beyond publicising the resource to guiding prospective users on how to navigate their searches \(particularly important in the US, since most attendees do not read Greek\). Many used the online resources during the talk and noted their successful findings on the questionnaires \(IMP2b\). 77% of those who filled a questionnaire at the end of the talk said they will engage with the database and 89% indicated they learned something new concerning their local or family history on the day of the talk \(IMP2b\). The talk traced the family history of specific individuals thus revealing aspects of the local history of their ancestral place of origin and offering an understanding of their ancestors’ migration experiences \(IMP2a\-b\). Feedback at the Illinois event stressed how the resource and event had for the first time opened up their understanding of ‘the migration history from Mykonos \[to Joliet\]’, providing ‘A greater understanding of the linking between Mykonos and Joliet’ and revealing ‘how much \[users’\] ancestors went through to migrate and find jobs’ \(IMP2a\-c, IMP8b\). Those who attended the public talks repeatedly stressed how transformational this introduction to family history had been on their individual and communal identities. The resource provided a ‘link to the past’ and allowed them to explore their ‘heritage and culture’, their ‘ **roots**’ \(IMP3\). Doing family history ‘changes the way of understanding of my own place \[of origin\] but also that of the path of \[my\] family history’, representing ‘the story of our existence’ and establishing ‘My identity’ \(IMP3\). Following these events, 82% of participants who had not engaged with family history before confirmed that they would start engaging with it \(IMP3\). 

 \(c\) Dissemination to and effects on schools 

 Hionidou also undertook a targeted drive to promote use of the **GreekFamilyHistory** resources in Greek schools. The intention was to guide pupils to employ such resources through a topic of their local history. Hionidou created a series of online lesson plans, each of which was accessible through the website in a dedicated ‘Education’ section. In a selected sample of schools in Greece, on the islands of Hios, Mykonos, Kythera and Syros, Hionidou organised and led a series of lessons to pilot the lessons’ use \(March, September, November 2019\). A total of 250 pupils attended these lessons, at times with the collaboration of local archives \(Kythera\) or the local library \(Hios, Hermoupolis\). The impact of the lessons was to educate and inform pupils about family history, linking this to a local history topic \(for example on Hios studying the ‘Massacre’ and its refugees to Hermoupolis, on Mykonos past occupations of the population, in Hermoupolis migration\). Besides using the resource, pupils were also guided on how to start their family history through conducting oral histories with their parents and grandparents. Bringing together parents, grandparents and children in this way was intended to ensure that vital family and local information are discussed, allowing the younger generations to acquire knowledge about their past not normally taught, for example the occupations of their female ancestors on Mykonos. Pupils were asked in questionnaires whether they knew what family history was before and after the lessons. These showed a 24% increase in the understanding of what family history is, with 48% reporting that they will engage with family history in the future \(IMP1\). Children of immigrants in Greece also expressed strong interest in learning about and performing family history in the future, asking for example if ‘there are similar sources on the internet about Albania’ \(IMP5c\). All Head\-Teachers and/or Deputy Head\-Teachers of the four Secondary schools expressed a strong interest on the lessons, the database and family history and expressed the intention to continue using them in teaching \(IMP5a\-e\). 

 <ins> **Impacts on organisations**</ins> 

 Besides its impact of the thousands of users who have engaged with GreekFamilyHistory, Hionidou’s research has brought significant benefits to major archival and genealogical organisations, both in Greece and internationally. Simply in numerical terms, Hionidou’s data has very significantly expanded the records made available through the two largest genealogical organisations in the world, *FamilySearch* and *Ancestry*. This has substantially expanded their reach into new communities of users, particularly in Greece and among the Greek diaspora. Communications from *Ancestry*, for example, acknowledge Hionidou’s role in alerting the company to the possibilities of Greek genealogical sources. Her research has been ‘instrumental’, Ancestry’s Content Acquisition Manager, noted, in transforming *Ancestry*’s ‘thinking in relation to the availability and quality of Greek Family History sources’ \(IMP10b\). 

 In some ways, the most profound impacts have been on Greek archives, and in particular in changing the ways in which these institutions are regarded and used in Greece. At a local level, Hionidou’s public engagement with local libraries \(Mykonos, Hermoupolis, Hios\), archives \(Athens, Kythera\) and Community centres supported fulfilment of their policies of public engagement \(IMP6a\-c, IMP6f, IMP5a, IMP5c, IMP9b\). The family history talks for adults and School children attracted different audiences from those regularly attending the libraries and community centres, thus **altering the profile** of those organisations \(IMP2b, IMP2d, IMP6b\-c, IMP6a referring to the School group\). The public talks resulted in the public’s engagement with archival sources. Such public engagement is still infrequent in Greece. The realisation that materials for family and community history are held in local archives had a significant effect on attitudes to and understandings of these municipal resources, as user feedback demonstrates: ‘\[I learned today\] that there exists an organised archive of family registers’; ‘\[I learned today that there are\] Census Records available for Mykonos’ \(IMP3, also IMP4, IMP5c\). Similarly, the school lessons improved the pupils’ awareness of where archival sources are held and what they can be used for. The lessons also improved the pupils’ engagement with such sources **,** in digital or in published form, and allowed them to understand how these are linked to their own past \(IMP6b, IMP5b\-d\), as the Headteacher of the secondary School in Kythera articulated: ‘we can utilise what we learned \[in the lessons\] through a school visit to the \[Local\] Archive, something that will help the pupils to see the Archive in an altered manner. The important thing is that some of them \[pupils\] will now have a **personal interest**; the Archive will not be an impersonal organisation ... It is about their family, the grandfather, their great\-grandfather. The pupils did adopt that thinking, as far as I can tell through observing them in the class’ \(IMP1, IMP5c\). 

 At a national level, Hionidou’s research impacted on the practices of the General State Archives of Greece. Specifically, the research led to changes in the GSAG’s thinking on the potential uses of some of their archives, and a commitment to ‘use these records in new, innovative ways’, as the GSAG Deputy Director/Acting Director put it \(IMP9b\). This specifically includes ‘new ways of engaging audiences digitally’, both through the resource and via bespoke webinars prepared by Hionidou, although they were unable to be delivered as planned in October 2021 due to the Covid\-19 pandemic \(see statement\). Taken together, the GSAG has confirmed that Hionidou’s ongoing work has had a ‘significant impact’ on their practice, and ‘identifies new values and uses for our resources’ \(IMP9b\). 

 Overall, Hionidou’s work has been one of the first resources to open up Greek family history to a large range of users, and has supported and even transformed the ways in which public and commercial organisations present and make use of population history. As the Deputy/Acting Director General of the GSAG put it, ‘her work is making our records more relevant to contemporary society.’ As well as expanding these organisations’ reach and their impact on people’s lives, Hionidou’s work has impacted directly on the understanding and learning of family history among school children, diasporic Greeks and adult Greeks too, strengthening both the individual’s and community’s identity and intangible heritage through the performance of family history. This was lucidly articulated by one of the participants: ‘The mining of information about our past and the reconstruction of our family history through the available sources is \- for many of us \-... a kind of physical need, a means to gain more knowledge and to reflect on our individual and collective present and future, a commemoration to those who preceded our existence’ \(IMP8d\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 PRiSM, the RNCM Centre for Practice & Research in Science & Music, promotes a collaborative interdisciplinary approach to musical composition which has had a number of impacts on creativity, culture and society. Including scientists in the creative process of composition, through enduring partnerships with composers, stimulated reflection on their own research from a new perspective, leading to new insights. Innovative curation and programming of the resulting musical works attracted new audiences for mathematics, science and contemporary music, and changed a cultural organisation’s approach to programming future events. Leading edge technology, developed and evolved in collaboration with composers, led to innovative new methods of composition. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 PRiSM was established as an interdisciplinary research centre at RNCM in 2017 by Emily Howard, RNCM Professor in Composition, Marcus du Sautoy, Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science and Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University, and David de Roure, Professor of e\-Research at the University of Oxford. Dedicated to the creation of new work through collaboration between musicians, mathematicians and scientists, PRiSM was awarded £914,000 in 2019 from the Research England fund *Expanding Excellence in England* \(E3\). 

 Howard has been a composer and academic at RNCM since 2005. With a background in mathematics, her compositions are frequently informed by scientific and mathematical concepts. In 2015, she was appointed Leverhulme Trust ‘Artist in Residence’, in the Department of Mathematical Sciences \(DMS\) at the University of Liverpool \(UoL\), collaborating with researchers in contemporary mathematics. Howard subsequently composed **Torus** \(2016\) \[3.2\],** part of her series *Orchestral Geometries* “transforming mathematical notions into musical ideas has become an important part of what I do”. 

 Ada Lovelace \(1815\-1852\) is of particular interest to the member of PRiSM. Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage on his proposal for a computing machine, the Analytical Engine, and proposed how the Engine could be used to create music. Howard’s **Ada sketches** \[3.1\]**, part of * **The Lovelace Trilogy** \(2011\)**, imagines the inner world of Lovelace as she explores a mathematical equation solved by the Analytical Engine. **But then, what are these numbers?** \(2019\) \[3.3\]** was commissioned by the Barbican Centre for the event *Ada Lovelace: Imagining the Analytical Engine,* curated by Howard as Director of PRiSM. The piece is based upon a setting of a letter by Lovelace to her mother. The text is dissected, randomised and reordered using algorithms from the earliest days of computing that form the foundations of modern Artificial Intelligence \(AI\). 

 **PRiSM SampleRNN \[3.5\]** is a computer\-assisted compositional tool released in June 2020, PRiSM’s first major contribution to the field of Machine Learning. It generates new audio outputs by ‘learning’ the characteristics of an existing corpus of sound or music. Changing parameters of the algorithm and how the dataset is organised significantly changes the output, making these choices part of the creative process. The audio generated can be used directly in a composition or to inform notated work to be played by an instrumentalist. The software was developed in response to work by Dr Sam Salem, PRiSM Lecturer in Composition. For his piece **Midlands** \(2019\)** **\[3.4\]**, Salem made field recordings whilst walking 120km of the River Derwent. These materials were used to synthesize new sounds with Wavenet, a deep\-learning algorithm, but the speed of the workflow made it difficult to explore the full possibilities of the technique. An alternative, SampleRNN, represented an opportunity to generate sound more quickly but the code was broken \(documented in the PRiSM blog post *A Psychogeography of Latent Space* **\[5.6\]**\). PRiSM Research Software Engineer Dr Christopher Melen, undertook a complete reimplementation of the SampleRNN code, fixing broken dependencies and upgrading it to work with the latest versions of Python and Tensorflow. It constitutes a completely new implementation of the SampleRNN architecture. 

 The release of PRiSM SampleRNN was accompanied by a model developed by Salem using data from the RNCM’s world\-class archive of choral music. Since then, it has developed into one of PRiSM’s major projects, bringing together practitioners across a diverse range of disciplines and fields of study, and illustrating PRiSM’s core research concerns of collaborative and interdisciplinary effort. It is currently being used in projects by composers, musicians and technologists across the globe. A free and open\-source project, the latest release can be downloaded from the software development platform *GitHub*. The software is readily available \(open source\) and the technique has been made explicit through a number of online resources and performances demonstrating this creative application of AI; informing technology researchers, other arts practitioners, educators and the general public.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 PRiSM created innovative new music and software through the interdisciplinary collaboration of scientists, mathematicians and composers, leading to a number of impacts on creativity, culture and society. Innovative communication of science, mathematics and a government healthcare initiative engaged new audiences in contemporary music and changed a cultural organisation’s approach to programming. Machine learning \(ML\) and artificial intelligence \(AI\) were applied to contemporary classical music in a new way, changing the practice of composers and demonstrating a novel application of the technology to the general public. 

 **Collaborative development of new software changed creative practices** 

 Dr Melen is the first computer scientist to hold the post of Research Software Engineer at RNCM. As well as developing the code for PRiSM SampleRNN **\[3.5\]**, he collaborated with RNCM and external composers, running the models that they designed together on the PRiSM Deep Learning Machine and exploring the effect of changing the parameters of the software on their specific audio data. As part of this iterative process, he found new ways to ‘tune’ the models in response to each composers’ needs. The application of ML to contemporary classical orchestral music, rather than modern popular music, presents unique data challenges in terms of the characteristics of the music. “Nobody else has done this to my knowledge, to this extent, on this kind of music before”. *Interview with Dr Christopher Melen* **\[5.6\]** Dr Melen also engaged with users exploring PRiSM SampleRNN through the platform where it is deployed \(user *relativeflux* on GitHub\). Comments from experienced followers of SampleRNN and non\-experts alike, were positive \(“Thanks for keeping Samplernn alive\!”; “Best parameters for a layperson”; “ I'm a musician and a teacher, and I needed a working and well documented RNN to introduce my students to”\) **\[5.6\]**. Melen’s PRiSM blog post *A Short History of Neural Synthesis* \(22 May 2020\), outlines the history and development of the code. A PRiSM tweet sharing the post was the top tweet for May 2020 \(6,884 impressions\) **\[5.7\]** 

 PRiSM invited American trombonist Weston Olencki to RNCM in December 2019 where Dr Salem captured over 2,000 individual sound recordings of solo trombone performance. Salem trained PRiSM SampleRNN code on the corpus of Olencki’s extended techniques to generate material for use in composition \( *Psychogeography of Latent Space* **\[5.6\]\).** On 26 September 2020, composer, performer and vocalist Jennifer Walshe gave the world premiere of *Ireland: A Dataset*, live streamed from the National Concert Hall in Dublin. A dataset of recordings of Irish traditional songs were analysed using PRiSM SampleRNN to generate AI\-generated versions which were then incorporated into the performance. Music Critic Alex Ross wrote “The results are at once nonsensical and oddly charming: Walshe seems to be suggesting that randomization can restore mystery to traditional material.” \( *Jennifer Walshe’s Sublime Chaos*, The New Yorker, October 19, 2020 **\[5.6\]\).** 

 **Enduring partnerships between scientists and composers led to new research insights** 

 Howard’s work with Lasse Rempe \(Professor of Pure Mathematics\) during her Leverhulme Residency in 2015 had a profound and long\-lasting effect on interaction between the UoL Department of Mathematical Science \(DMS\) and other departments such as Physics, Chemistry and English with the Department of Music, and led to new interdisciplinary collaborations. “There is no question that hosting Emily contributed immensely to the intellectual environment in our department” Professor Lasse Rempe, DMS **\[5.1\]**. The relationship between these departments and RNCM also endured. *8 Cubed 2020,* paired 8 RNCM and UoL composition students with 8 UoL scientists to create music on topics ranging from airport noise and animal behaviour to biomechanics. Rachel Bearon, Professor of Mathematical Biology, UoL said of her collaboration with RNCM student Anna Appleby on *Uptake* \(2020\) “It was thrilling to see how scientific concepts were translated into a musical score, and also to gain insight of the creative process. The conversations provided us the opportunity to explore our modelling philosophy from a new perspective, and has provided the strengthening of ties across a diverse range of departments at the University of Liverpool, from Music to Eye and Vision Science.” **\[5.3\]** 

 Scientists from Manchester Metropolitan University \(MMU\) took part in the first iteration of 8 cubed in 2018. Whilst working on *Hive \(2018\)* with RNCM composer Robert Oswell Smith, Dr Jenny Rowntree, Senior Lecturer in Ecological Genetics and Applied Conservation \(MMU\) discovered that the sounds of a hive could be used as an indicator of colony health. **\[5.2\]** 

 Several composers and scientists that met through the two iterations of 8 cubed have continued to work together on new projects. For example, PRiSM Doctoral Researcher Bofan Ma’s collaboration with Professor Keeley Crockett, Professor in Computational Intelligence \(MMU\), *offset iii*  based on Crockett’s research project ‘Silent Talker’; a camera\-assisted, lie detecting AI system that analyses non\-verbal behaviour. She saw the collaboration as an opportunity to encourage people to look at AI technology more positively. “This partnership has brought a new dimension to my research and it has been an enriching experience to work with Bofan – such a creative and talented composer. The pieces provided me with a unique window to see how AI is interpreted by others who are not in the field, in novel and interesting ways. The reconfiguration of performance gestures was fascinating and made me focus more on how AI is perceived, interpreted and understood by the general public. The idea that there needs to be much better communication and education of AI has led to a number of new avenues, one of which is work on Place Based Ethical AI in Greater Manchester, which was undertaken with Policy Connect and the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Data Analytics \(Report Launch October 2020\).” **\[5.2\]** 

 PRiSM Doctoral Researcher Zakiya Leeming first met Mathias Brust, UoL Professor of Chemistry during Howard’s Leverhulme residency and they have continued a dialogue on music and science. Leeming’s audiovisual piece \[U\]nusual \[m\]etals \(2020\) examined the concept of wave\-particle duality from discussions with Brust, who said “Having seen how, through the lens of a composer, a physical phenomenon can be expressed artistically in sound \(and pictures\)…this can give us a new perspective that can yield new insight.” **\[5.3\]** 

 **Engaging new audiences for mathematics, science and contemporary music in new ways** 

 PRiSM research has enabled music to connect  and engage audiences with unlikely topics for musical expression. PRiSM Doctoral Researcher Zakiya Leeming led four RNCM doctoral researchers in a collaboration with *Connected Health Cities* \(CHC\), a government\-funded programme communicating the benefits of sharing health data across the North of England. RNCM composers were paired with managers of CHC research projects. Five new pieces were premiered by Festivo Winds at a sold\-out event *\#MusicSaysDataSavesLives* at Manchester Museum \(September 2019\). “For a long time, we have been exploring new ways to reach out and have conversations about health data. Communication through music has expanded our \#DataSavesLives message by bringing together two complementary worlds,” Dr Amanda Lamb, CHC Deputy Director & Chief Operating Officer **\[5.8\]**. “I never thought you could build a creative relationship between music and data...It was brilliant,” Audience feedback card **\[5.8\]**. The five performances were shared for the first time in December 2020 via the PRiSM website. The Tweet from @RNCMPRiSM announcing the new material was the top Tweet that month, with 8,020 impressions **\[5.7\]**. 

 *The PRiSM Perception App* was developed by PRiSM and Oxford e\-Research Centre in collaboration with the EPRSC ‘Fusing Audio and Semantic Technologies’ project. It was launched at the PRiSM event “ *The Music of Proof: What does Maths Sound like?*” held at RNCM in conjunction with Manchester Science Festival in October 2017. Data was collected from 249 of 600 audience members using the App at a performance of *The Ligeti Fanfares* \(1985\) *,* to investigate how people perceive musical segmentation whilst listening to contemporary classical music. At another event “ *Music and Maths*”, attended by over 800 people, 500 members of the audience used the App to indicate where they perceived palindromes in a performance of Haydn’s Symphony No. 47 in G major ‘The Palindrome’ by the Oxford Philharmonic at the Sheldonion Theatre, Oxford in Jan 2018. This research has implications for contemporary composers, performers, and audiences and how they engage with new music in particular **\[5.5\]**. 

 In November 2019, Howard curated the event ‘ *Ada Lovelace: Imagining the Analytical Engine*’, commissioned by the Barbican Centre as part of their programme ‘Life Rewired’. Four works were premiered including Howard’s *But then, what are these numbers?* \(2019\) \[ **3.3\]** and *Alter* \(2019\) by the PRiSM team, led by Robert Laidlow. *Alter* is about, and utilises, AI, and features a new musical instrument, *The Lovelace Engine*, modelled on Babbage’s Analytical Engine. *The Lovelace Engine* was realised by Mechanical Engineer Jonathan Morris \(Cambridge Design Partnership\) in collaboration with Laidlow **\[5.9\]** to great acclaim. “The piece created by Robert Laidlow and the PRiSM team brought whimsy and creativity to their commission, Alter, visually representing the Analytical Engine with a digitally printed instrument that was part of the music itself.” Sarah Hickling, Classical Music Programming, Barbican Centre **\[5.10\]\)**. “Alter…had a gratifying sense of theatrics, using an analytical engine replica as a percussion instrument” \(The Guardian 3 November 2019 **\[5.4\]\)**. The Tweet by @RNCMPRiSM, sharing performances from the event was the top Tweet in March, with 11,300 impressions **\[5.7\]**. The online recording of *Alter* has been viewed over 600 times \( [https://youtu.be/L1mQGaNmfUM](https://youtu.be/L1mQGaNmfUM)\). 

 **Impact on Cultural Organisations** 

 The Classical Music Programming Team at The Barbican praised the PRiSM team’s use of national media **\[5.4\]** to promote the event, which “reached outside of the usual classical music outlets \[and\] meant that we welcomed a more cross\-arts audience… who greatly enjoyed the lively discussion and engaging music.” Working with Howard as a curator changed the team’s approach to programming future events. “We are exploring using the role of expert curator more frequently across our programme, challenging the knowledge and experience of our in house team by bringing in expertise from outside our four walls”. “The involvement of PRiSM opened up new opportunities for us in terms of access to expertise and resources, something we would hope to replicate for future projects in our work with other organisations and institutions.” **\[5.10\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Ecological Engineering at the University of Southampton \(UoS\) has improved the sustainability of river infrastructure throughout the world and has achieved savings conservatively estimated to exceed GBP20 million since 2014. This has been possible through novel approaches to: 

 **1.1** **Innovative fish passage and screening** to improve ecology around industrial development in Europe \(UK and Netherlands\), South America \(Chile and Brazil\) and Asia \(China and Laos\); 

 **1.2** **Preventing spread of invasive fish** to preserve fisheries and livelihoods of thousands in the North American Great Lakes and to conserve unique species endemic to Lake Malawi; 

 **1.3** **Dam decommissioning** in Europe, and North and South America to the benefit of the water supply and electricity generating industry, low income fisheries stakeholders in developing nations, regulatory agencies, and the general public. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Globally we face unprecedented challenges in managing our freshwater resources to achieve sustainability, security and equity of supply. Assuming “business\-as\-usual”, in 2050 the global demand for water will have increased by 55% from a 2000 baseline \(OECD\). Water is an essential component of our energy systems, with the generation of electricity being dependent on large quantities taken from rivers, e.g. at hydroelectric dams and power stations. This exploitation can have considerable negative consequences for other ecosystem services, such as fisheries \(annually 11.9 million tonnes of fish are captured in inland waters, FAO 2014\) that provide a self\-sustaining source of protein for millions of people. Inland fresh waters are the most threatened of all ecosystems, being much more extensively degraded by humans than any other \(Convention on Biological Diversity 2016\). In light of the need to mitigate the negative impacts of freshwater exploitation, this case study focuses on the protection of water resources, particularly fisheries, in\-line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Since 2005, researchers at UoS have achieved this by developing new approaches to enhance the sustainability of water and energy infrastructure. 

 **2.1 Innovative fish passage and screening:** 

 **2.1.1** UoS developed a new Cylindrical Bristle Cluster \(CBC\) fish pass that is installed on gauging weirs to enhance passability for fish by reducing drag without impacting weir function \[ **3.1**\]. Funded by the UK Environment Agency \(EA\). 

 **2.1.2** UoS developed a behavioural rule\-base of multi\-species fish response to hydrodynamics associated with fishways that has proven critical to the design of the world’s most innovative fish pass, the fish migration river, in the Netherlands. 

 **2.1.3** Led by UoS in collaboration with HR Wallingford and the University of Nottingham, an integrated hydrodynamic and Agent Based Model \(ABM\) to predict the movement patterns of endangered European eel has been adopted by the UK and Swedish power industry. Funded by the EPSRC “Vaccinating the Nexus” programme \(EP/N005961/1\). 

 **2.1.4** A novel electric deterrent has been developed at UoS to deflect European eel from power stations on the St Lawrence River, Canada and US. Funded by the US Electric Power Research Institute \(EPRI 17982/01\). 

 **2.1.5** In collaboration with several South American partners the impact of rapid decompression during turbine passage has been quantified to help improve hydropower operation procedures. Funded by British Council \[20181003\], FAPEMIG, EU Keepfish \[690857\], and CONICYT, and by industry \(e.g. Cemig\). 

 **2.1.6** In collaboration with the Institute of Hydroecology and the Three Gorges University \(China\) and the University of Concepcion \(Chile\) a database on the swimming performance \(e.g. \[ **3.2**\]\) of a range of fish species has been created and used in the innovative design of multi\-species fish passage facilities on large\-scale dams on the Mekong River in Lao People's Democratic Republic. 

 **2.2 Preventing spread of invasive fish:** 

 Understanding of fish response to environmental stimuli and their locomotory performance, particularly of rarely studied species such as those belonging to the anguilliform group \(i.e. long bodied fish such as eel and lamprey\) \[ **3.3**\], has proven essential to the development of strategies to prevent the geographic spread of invasive species. UoS has played a pivotal role in developing guidance to limit the impacts of invasive fish, including \(1\) the sea lamprey in the Great Lakes of the US and Canada, and \(2\) Tigerfish in Malawi. 

 **2.3 Dam decommissioning:** 

 UoS provided expertise to quantify impacts, and plan decommissioning of, redundant infrastructure that acts as barriers to fish migration. Impact has been attained in \(1\) the UK and Europe, \(2\) South America and \(3\) Canada. The development of a rapid barrier assessment tool enabled the creation of the first European Atlas of River Barriers as part of the AMBER project \( **3.4**\), which fed directly into European Policy related to the “Green Deal”. The development of models to predict sediment release under varying dam removal scenarios, impact of turbines on fish passage, and hydropower planning decision support tools \[ **3.5**\], including those based on catchment\-scale optimisation approaches \[ **3.6**\], in collaboration with the University of Kent, have informed international power companies and influenced their business development. Funded by the EU H2020 AMBER \(Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers – EU 689682\) programme, FAPEMIG \(Brazilian research council of Minas Gerais state\), Cemig \(Brazilian power industry\), and the Canadian River Institute.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1 Innovative fish passage and screening in Europe, South America and Asia** 

 **4.1.1** The UK national hydrometry network comprises over 1500 gauging weirs. The EA faces the conflicting challenge of maintaining flow monitoring capability while improving ecological status of rivers degraded by this infrastructure which disrupts fluvial connectivity. In 2018, the EA adopted the Cylindrical Bristle Cluster fish pass developed by UoS as best practice for a low\-cost mitigation option for gauging weirs and their preferred “technology of choice” when ameliorating the impact of gauging weirs on fish movement. Since 2018, the low\-cost design has been installed by several conservation groups, including the Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust \[ **5.1**\], who have fitted the fish pass on multiple weirs to open up several kilometres of previously inaccessible river. Dr Peri Karageorgopoulos from the EA states that, “ *It is simple to design and quick to fit. As a result the cost per site can be as little as \[GBP5,000\]. The alternative solution which requires a bypass of the structure can easily cost \[GBP200,000\-GBP500,000\]. As a result we are not only making tremendous savings but we are also planning to install many more bristle passes than we could ever deliver as bypasses…… the University of Southampton have created a novel, cost effective and efficient fish pass which will help improve fish populations worldwide*” \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **4.1.2** The Fish Migration River is the first large\-scale innovative fish pass of its type under construction in the Netherlands. Funded by Nieuwe Afsluitdijk, a consortium of five regional authorities, this is the largest hydraulic engineering project undertaken in the Netherlands in the 20th Century and will set a global precedent by reconnecting the Ijsselmeer and Wadden Sea, cut\-off by the 32.5 km long Afsluitdijk dam as part of the Zuiderzee Works since 1927. Since 2014, UoS has been a key participant, providing expert advice based on research experience since the early phases of the design, and ensuring that several modifications have been made to accommodate fish behaviour during the design phase. Erik Bruins Slot, the hydraulic engineering lead for the Province of Fryslân, estimates that the advice provided by UoS has saved the project between EUR5,000,000 and EUR10,000,000 and enabled planning consent to be achieved. He states “ *The advice provided by the University of Southampton allowed the designs to be modified and optimised based on expert knowledge of fish behaviour. This input was essential in enabling the project to go\-ahead and for appropriate funding to be secured because we could show that the design was state\-of\-the\-art and based on sound scientific understanding*” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **4.1.3** In May 2017, the integrated hydrodynamic ABM to predict eel movements at power stations was validated at a hydropower site on the Motala ström, Norrköping in Sweden, enabling energy company RWE to meet regulatory requirements and continue their operations. Since then it has been used to inform planning and operation of RWE Generation plants at Tilbury and Pembroke, respectively. Dr Waygood from RWE said, “ *Based on the potential shown* \[in relation to the Swedish project\] *, RWE Generation UK engaged with the Southampton team to further develop the ABM to predict the potential for fish to encounter intake screens on the tidal Thames*” \[ **5.4**\]. 

 **4.1.4** Based on experiments conducted at UoS, fundamental information on threshold and behavioural response of eel to electric fields has been used by the Electric Power Research Institute \(EPRI\) to develop behavioural deterrents to facilitate safe downstream passage at hydropower dams for American eel on the St Lawrence River since 2017. This has enabled the industry to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. Results of experiments conducted at UoS were published in an EPRI Technical Report in 2018 \[ **5.5**\]. Paul Jacobson \(EPRI\) states that, “ *The results are also applicable on other rivers throughout the geographic range of the American eel and the European eel, potentially saving facility owners substantial sums of money where electrical deterrence is not appropriate \(more than $1.5M for field scale experimentation in the case of the St. Lawrence River\) and identifying environmental settings for which further investigation is warranted*” \[ **5.6**\]. 

 **4.1.5** As part of Cemig’s \(responsible for 12% of Brazil’s generation and distribution of electricity\) *Peixe Vivo* \(Fish for Life\) programme, measures to protect fish at South American hydropower plants have been advanced, and engagement with regulators and the public achieved. UoS was responsible for the transfer of knowledge related to the effects of turbine passage on fish and the mitigation of these since 2007, which has continued until today. Funded by the British Council, researchers and students from the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Sustainable Infrastructure Systems \(CDT\-SIS\) collaborated with Brazilian partners to investigate the impacts of barotrauma on commercially important fisheries. The results helped Cemig plan the operation regimes of its plants to minimise negative environmental impacts \(individual fish mortality events can be measured in several thousand tons and result in fines of up to 50 million Brazilian Real \[GBP9,750,000\]\). This project won the 2017 Brazilian National Odebrecht Award for Sustainable Development and Kemp gave the keynote address at a special session on dam decommissioning at the 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary conference to celebrate the achievements of Peixe Vivo in 2018. 

 **4.1.6** Building on the EU *Keepfish* project, UoS has developed strong links with the Chilean hydropower industry, e.g. Colbun. Student exchange, including group projects conducted by those on the EPSRC funded CDT\-SIS programme in 2017, enabled the development of novel fish passage technology to protect threatened native fish species seldom previously studied. As a result, new fish passage technology has been implemented in Chile. In collaboration with Fishtek Consulting Ltd., in 2015 UoS helped design a unique fish pass installed at the Xayaburi Dam \(Mekong River in Laos\) that enables a high degree of flexibility to provide alternative routes for the widest variety of species. The development of a methodology for assessing fish swimming capability represented an important transfer of knowledge to initiate an ongoing programme of research that would enable the dam owners to alter the operation of the fish pass to enhance efficiency. Dr Toby Coe \(Fishtek\), stated that, “ *The fish pass design was updated dramatically following your input into the project. It has gone from a relatively small vertical slot pass up to a very large vertical slot pass that takes fish up to a huge double fish lock/lift. …. The information gleaned for the fish swimming trials developed was used to inform the fish pass design”* \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **4.2 Preventing spread of invasive fish** 

 **4.2.1** Sea lamprey, a parasitic fish native to the Atlantic Ocean, was introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes system in the 1830s as a result of the construction on locks and shipping canals. The impact of this parasite on Great Lake fisheries, currently worth more than $7 billion annually and supporting around 75,000 jobs, as a result of damage and mortality was immense, resulting in significant declines in several stocks. As part of the lamprey control programme, UoS has worked closely with the Great Lake Fisheries Commission \(GLFC\) since 2016 to design a new “selective bi\-directional” fish pass and research facility that will allow the movement of desirable fish species from the lakes into the tributary streams where they spawn, while at the same time blocking and potentially trapping the unwanted lamprey. In conjunction with this, and based on experience of running a world\-class ecohydraulics laboratory, UoS has worked with the GLFC to develop a multipurpose laboratory and visitor centre \(total project cost approx. $20 million\) on the Boardman River in Traverse City, Michigan, with the capability to develop and test prototype fish passes and educate the public. Kemp is a member of the expert panel tasked with advising on the co\-ordination of these initiatives. Andrew Muir, the Science Director of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission states that, “ *The advice provided by the University of Southampton helped inform the design criteria of FishPass based on expert knowledge of fish behavior. This input, founded on sound scientific understanding, was essential to receiving appropriate funding to complete the engineering design in 2019 and start construction in 2020*” \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **4.2.2** In Malawi, the planned Shire Valley Irrigation Project \(SVIP\) is designed to provide irrigation services to 42,000ha. As part of this scheme, the main feeder canal is designed to abstract up to 50m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>\-1</sup> of water from the Shire River and convey it via gravity to agricultural fields. SVIP will be implemented by the Government of Malawi, with external funding from the World Bank, African Development Bank, and other sources. UoS provided expert advice on methods to prevent the movement of fish from two distinct assemblages naturally separated by the 75m high Kapichira Falls. Of particular concern is the spread of Tigerfish from the Lower Shire\-Zambezi ecoregion \(below the falls\) to globally significant and unique Lake Malawi ecosystem, with many hundreds of fish species found nowhere else. As a voracious predator, introduction of the Tigerfish could have very severe ecological consequences, including potentially the global extinction of numerous fish species endemic to Lake Malawi. Since 2017, Kemp was recruited as a member of the expert panel convened by the World Bank based on his experience with fish passage engineering. He was tasked with advising on potential options to prevent introduction of invasive species, such as the Tigerfish. Pieter Wallewijn from the World Bank stated that, “ *Professor Kemp reviewed the design and made recommendations for improvements based on expertise on how different fish species are capable of movement within irrigation canal systems and crossing various types of physical barriers. While the design process is still ongoing, these insights have contributed greatly to improving the efficacy of the design for this critical issue. His advice was of high quality, very timely and provided constructive practical guidance to the designers”* \[ **5.9**\]. 

 **4.3 Dam decommissioning** 

 **4.3.1** Working through the EU H2020 AMBER and the Brazilian FAPEMIG programmes, UoS has been a key participant in quantifying the abundance of river barriers in Europe, and weir and dam removal feasibility projects in the UK and Europe \(e.g. Bossington weir\), Brazil \(e.g. Pandeiros Dam\) and Canada \(e.g. Mactaquac Dam\). In AMBER, the UoS developed and applied a rapid barrier assessment tool that provided and validated data on which the European Atlas of River Barriers was based, and helped prioritise restoration actions, including dam decommissioning, by the most cost\-effective means while providing the greatest gains for biodiversity. The project identified more than one million barriers in Europe’s rivers, a result that fed directly into the EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy setting a target of reconnecting at least 25,000 km of Europe’s rivers by 2030. In the UK, expert advice has been provided to the EA since 2014 in relation to weir removals on the River Test in Southern England. In addition, the UoS provided one of the few long\-term assessments of physical, chemical and ecological response to weir removal in the UK. 

 **4.3.2** In association with the Peixe Vivo programme and the University of Kent, the UoS developed an optimisation\-based decision support planning tool that was shared with the Cemig in 2018. The outputs of the model were used to evaluate plans for developing the São Francisco River through simultaneously combining the information on proposed new build sites and potential for decommissioning existing infrastructure. As a result, a decision was made to remove the Pandeiros Dam, which if sanctioned will be the first dam removal in South America. A cohort of students enrolled on the CDT\-SIS programme investigated the potential impact of removal and associated sediment release on the downstream geomorphology of the river, including on a wetland of high conservation significance. The results were fed back to the project managers who incorporated the findings of the studies into their overall hydropower planning strategy. Rafael Fiorine from Cemig states that, “ *The contributions from the University of Southampton professionals were crucial for the advance of the Pandeiros’ Dam Decommissioning Project… Additionally, the sediment dynamic model built was a major support for requesting a legal authorization for the second stage of the decommissioning viability study. We estimate that Cemig would save a minimum of GBP17,453,334 in the period of ten years following dam removal as a result of the reduced maintenance costs related to the safety of the dam structure*” \[ **5.10**\]. 

 **4.3.3** Since 2014, a similar feasibility assessment of dam removal was conducted for the Mactaquac dam, Canada, in collaboration with Canadian Rivers and New Brunswick Power. UoS researchers joined international collaborators at the University of New Brunswick to use innovative modelling techniques to predict the effect of dam removal on stored reservoir sediments and identify potential environmental and economic impacts. New Brunswick Power used the information to identify that dam removal was not the most sustainable option, opting instead for more environmentally friendly turbine units. Prof. Katy Haralampides, the Mactaquac Project leader representing Canadian Rivers at the University of New Brunswick, said, “ *… the impact that you and your research have had on our project has been substantial. It is difficult to quantify, but convincing NB Power to consider an Alden turbine will have lasting positive environmental effects for generations. Our research focus has changed as a result of your input, and we have successfully received additional funding from the industry partner to continue the projects. We are awaiting word from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council about our \~\[USD2,000,000\] proposal for matching funding*” \[ **5.11**\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof. Ravi Deepres’ multi\-disciplinary research has revolutionised contemporary dance practice, by inserting cutting\-edge digital technologies into the choreographic process to create novel works for stage, screen and exhibition. Through his long\-term collaboration with the internationally renowned contemporary dance company Studio Wayne McGregor \(SWM\), Deepres’ research has expanded the company’s understanding of contemporary choreography and prompted innovation in its practice. His research is central to acclaimed modern dance works, such as SWM’s Olivier Award winning Woolf Works, and Atomos, which at the time of writing have reached a combined audience of 778,904. The long\-lasting influence of Deepres’ research is apparent in his collaborators’ confidence to explore new technologies in other creative projects, such as Google’s online Living Archive of Dancers with SWM, new commissions by the National Gallery and National Ballet of Canada, and the creation of a new commissioning opportunity that benefitted an emerging artist. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Deepres’ research uses innovative adaptation and implementation of cutting\-edge visual and digital technology to create unique artistic representations of the human body in movement. In doing so, it reframes choreography as a multi\-disciplinary collaborative practice. The outputs of the three projects included in this submission are a gallery exhibition, two theatre productions with SWM, with whom Deepres has collaborated since the year 2000, and a film for the BBC. These form a body of work that explores two central research themes. The first tackles conceptual questions of narrative structure, temporal perception, and the role of the choreographer in contemporary dance practice. The second is concerned with advancing the use of cutting\-edge film technology as a key component of a multi\-disciplinary choreography process. 

 Deepres has collaborated with technology companies, whose solutions are normally used within the fields of architecture, surveying and the sciences. These experiments led to the development of novel techniques for applying technologies, such as LIDAR scanning \(a 3D mapmaking and surveying technique\), 3D projection and super\-slow\-motion technology to capture live images of the human body. 

 The results of these experiments have been integrated into the choreographic process, resulting in works that combine live dancers with digital and film media. In each of the three projects that contribute to this submission \(detailed below\), Deepres located his practice at a different point in the choreographic development process \(R01, R02\). 

 
<ins>Atomos \(201</ins><ins>5</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>\(R03\)</ins> was **a collaborative project with SWM.** Research was undertaken in collaboration with LCI Productions, a 3D and event projection company, to find a new way to use 3D imagery on moving screens in order to combine specially shot film footage with graphic animation. This resulted in a novel methodology that allowed human dancers to respond to virtual ones, framing film design as a component of a multi\-disciplinary choreographic practice. Atomos **was later adapted into a film, directed by Deepres, and broadcast online by the BBC. In the process of adapting the stage production to screen, Deepres, as director, was obliged to make choreographic decisions about which of the dancer’s movements would appear on screen at any given moment. This necessitated the development of techniques that reframe the relationship between 3D film technology and the role of choreography. \(R05\)** 

 
<ins>Woolf Works \(2015\)</ins>\(R04\) was a contemporary dance production made in collaboration with SWM and the Royal Ballet. Here, the research objective was to combine film and dance in a way that referenced Woolf’s experimental use of metaphor and narrative structure to reflect the contemporary social and political climate. Experimentation was undertaken that resulted in the development of a translucent gauze screen, allowing the presentation of a metaphorical scene to the audience, as an illusionary layer, which at first appears physical and then becomes transparent. 

 
<ins>Gain Line \(2015\)</ins> <ins>\(</ins>R04\) was a film installation commissioned by Rugby Art Gallery \(RAG\) to celebrate the UK’s hosting of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The research aim was to explore how the design of the rugby pitch could be adapted for use in a choreographic practice that presented players’ movements in an artistic context, reframing the history and identity of the game of rugby. Research began by analysing the ethnography of cultural and social groups involved within the game. In collaboration with producers Film & Video Umbrella \(FVU\) and laser\-scanning company APR Services, various technologies, primarily LIDAR scanning, were adapted for first\-time use in an artistic project for filming training sessions and live matches. The outcome was a 17\-minute moving image installation that used choreographic and filmic techniques to present the movement of rugby players, uniquely in an art gallery setting.

### 1.  Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Deepres’ research combines techniques of film, photography and the novel application of digital technologies. It has led to an expansion of the boundaries of contemporary choreography, a fact recognised by his nomination for the prestigious ‘Knight of Illumination’ award in 2015 \(RG01\). His research has significantly influenced the choreographic practice at one of the leading contemporary dance companies in the world, SWM, and has contributed to developing skills within the production team and to opening up new opportunities for other technological collaborations. Deepres’ innovative use of technology has also influenced new commissioning opportunities for other artists. 

 <ins>1 – Expanding the understanding and practice of contemporary choreography</ins> 

 This research has made a significant and demonstrable impact on the way that choreography is conceptualised at SWM, and consequently how it is presented to audiences internationally. During Deepres’ 20\-year collaboration with the SWM’s lighting teams, set designers and choreographers, his research has introduced novel forms of technology that have redefined the scope of choreography. SWM’s choreographer and director acknowledges that Deepres’ innovative techniques with film and photography have helped SWM to explore and create entirely new expressions of choreographic practice. He explains that Deepres’ “ *vision and ideas have allowed \[SWM\] to use still and moving images in extraordinary ground\-breaking new ways, changing the potential of choreography to happen in virtual space and not be limited to the physical body* *\[by showing\]* *both \[SWM\] and the wider dance world the potential of creating new choreographic languages through technology*.” \(S01\) 

  

 Deepres’ research shaped the novel use of technology in SWM’s Atomos \(2015\) and the critically acclaimed Woolf Works \(2015\), which won the 2015 Olivier Award for Best Dance Production. Wolf Works attracted sell\-out audiences in the Royal Opera House, UK and La Scala, Italy. Atomos has been performed in 63 venues internationally to a total audience of 69,543 \(S02\). Both productions were recorded and made into films and have been shown at cinemas in the UK, internationally and broadcast on BBC Four, to audiences of 201,011 \(Atomos\) and 492,373 \(WW\) \(S02\). 

 An integral part of Atomos was the novel application of LIDAR scanning technology that Deepres developed with APR Services. It produced visual 3D material that influenced and changed how SWM’s choreographer and director worked with the dancers on stage, serving as templates for new forms of choreographic expression. 

 The Wolf Works film was projected onto a mesh screen at the front of the stage that allowed audiences to see the dancer’s movements and the projection of super slow\-motion images simultaneously. This, when combined with a narration of Woolf’s writing, created a novel setting for the way audiences experience narrative structure. 

 SWM’s choreographer and director confirms that during the production of Wolf Works, Deepres’ research prompted a shift in his understanding, leading to a methodological change: “ *At the end of Woolf Works Act 1, the innovative use of laser scanning imagery created an almost 3\-dimensional fragmented mesh on stage, changing how \[I\] understood the spatial dynamics of the stage and hence adopted parts of the physical choreography in response.”* \(S01\).  The dynamic contribution of Deepres’ research in the final production is also confirmed in a review in *The Guardian* \(2013\), which notes that *""When the work flies, it's because the research has been absorbed into the fabric of the choreography…”* \(S03\). 

 <ins>2 – Developing skills and encouraging new explorations</ins> 

 The influence of Deepres’ research is also indirectly conveyed through his collaborative relationships, introducing partners to new multi\-disciplinary techniques and experimental approaches to technology. For example, Deepres’ research collaborations with SWM have encouraged and spawned subsequent creative arts projects that explore the boundaries of dance and technology, such as SWM’s experimental project with Google, ‘Living Archive’. This is a collaboration with Google to turn SWM’s archive of dance into an online creative tool using machine learning \(S04\). In addition, SWM’s Executive Producer \(S05\) acknowledges that it is through working with Deepres to turn Atomos from a live production to a recorded output, that gave the company the knowledge and confidence to undertake ‘Winged Bull in the Elephant Case’, a collaborative film project with Arts Council England, Battersea Arts Centre and BBC Arts that was broadcast on BBC 2 \(03/03/2018\) and exhibited in the National Gallery \(05/03 – 08/04/2018\) to a combined audience of 737,239 \(S06 & S02\). 

 Similarly, the director of RAG explained that collaborating with Deepres has had long\-lasting impact on the gallery’s confidence to explore and use digital formats. Gain Line was the first time RAG had commissioned something digitally on such a large scale, and she said of her experience of working with Deepres that it gave them: “ *the confidence as an organisation to be able to do more… so I would say in terms of the technical knowledge and confidence to go for stuff like that has increased as a result of having worked \[with Deepres\]*.”\(S07\) 

 <ins>3 \- Creating new commissioning opportunities</ins> 

 Deepres’ research has been central to the creation of new commissioning opportunities. 

 The artistic administrator of the National Ballet of Canada \(NBC\) acknowledged that: “ *Mr. Deepres’ work as film designer…specifically on Woolf Works…is a key ingredient and integral component of the commission…*” of a major new co\-production between NBC and the Royal Ballet, scheduled for 2022 \(S08\). 

 After working on Gain Line, the directors of Film & Video Umbrella \(FVU\) commissioned a new work from an emerging artist that also used LIDAR technology \(2017\). The FVU technical manager acknowledges “ *a definite connection between working with Ravi, working with that particular \[LIDAR\] technology, seeing what it could do, and then introducing that to another artist.”* \(S09\) This demonstrates how their subsequent decision to create the opportunity via the Jerwood/FVU Awards was a direct result of Deepres’ research. The artist in question observed that, as a result of this prestigious commission and the consequent raising of his artistic profile, he has been able to access further professional opportunities that otherwise would not have been open to him. He has stated that the project he is currently working on was made possible because of the *“experience of working on the FVU project”* and that the prestige attached to the FVU/Jerwood award *“made it easier to produce more higher\-end films, and get budgets that are more realistic to pull these kind of projects off.”* \(S10\) 

 The evidence \(S01\-S10\) included here speaks to the diverse and far\-reaching impact of Deepres’ innovative research. By challenging conventional understandings of choreography, via the novel application of visual technologies, he has provoked significant changes in the practice of both his immediate collaborators and of those further afield. Additionally, the impact of his work on skills development has led to new opportunities for a range of arts practitioners.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 BCU’s research has set a new cultural agenda for the role of landscape as a strategic mechanism for sustainable city region transformation. It steered HS2’s design policy towards careful integration with the landscape and initiated an urban National Park for the West Midlands \(WMNP\). The programme underpins the West Midlands Combined Authority’s current sustainability agenda and directs long\-term social and economic regeneration in the Black Country *.* It was instrumental in setting the course for the Black Country being awarded UNESCO Geopark status. Research combined with advocacy resulted in the African Landscape Network adopting a Landscape Charter for the first time.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Moore’s research is based on her redefinition of perception which challenges the habitual dualities of fact and value, ‘real truth’ vs ‘mere opinion’. The research presents an integrated approach to regional transformation and cuts through professional silos forging a new understanding of landscape based on the relationship between a community and its territory. 

 Prior to Moore’s research it was commonly thought that the art of design was unteachable because that skill was presumed to be ‘inherent’ or ‘mystical’ and relied on a student’s prelinguistic ability to think in a certain way. Moore presented an alternative understanding based on a Pragmatic/interpretative definition of perception which offers tangible connections between theory and practice, ideas and form, nature and culture. Her research redefines perception as intelligence and moves debate away from the realm of metaphysics into the real world informed by knowledge and ideas, making education profoundly more democratic. As a consequence of redefining perception, and taking account of interviews with the world’s foremost landscape designers, Moore also expanded the definition of landscape as the relationship between a community and its territory \(rather than a purely physical artefact\). This work was published internationally \(including translation into Mandarin\) as Overlooking The Visual: Demystifying the Art of Design \(hereafter OTV\) \[ **R01**\], and concluded by asking whether the new interdependent definitions of perception and landscape can transform a region and if so, how? 

 The HS2 Landscape Vision exploratory research project sought to explore this question and applied Moore’s vision to a regional scale examining HS2 as a once\-in\-a\-generation opportunity for regional transformation, shifting the political debate towards social, economic, and environmental catalysts. Moore developed new landscape\-scale graphic explorations to examine the West Midlands region from an interpretative and integrated standpoint, contrasting with the techno\-scientific analytical and graphic conventions that still dominate the infrastructure development sector \[ **R02**\]. 

 Moore’s design\-led research and exploratory drawings for the Black Country Consortium resulted in a vision for the region’s landscape that included geology, topography and culture called ‘ *above, beyond, below’*. Running through the research is the articulation that improving quality of life, quality of the environment and raising aspirations is essential to regional transformation. This is expressed in the ambitious research underpinning a completely new kind of National Park; a social, economic and environmental proposition that celebrates and harnesses people’s connection to everyday landscapes \[ **R03**\].

 Further design\-led research for Tame Valley Wetlands and the European SATURN project with Nikologianni and Larkham established the importance of strategic design leadership and repositioning the landscape as the driver and sustainer of future sustainable development \[ **R04**\]. 

 As President of the UK Landscape Institute \(2004\-06\) and the International Federation of Landscape Architects \(IFLA\) \(2014\-18\), Moore cut across art/science, nature/culture, fact/value silos advancing landscape as a holistic unifying concept, utilising her work on the International Landscape Convention \(ILC\) \[ **R02, R03,** **R05**\] to strengthen the research into the value of landscape to societies \[ **R06**\]. This research connects with and uncovers the value and significance of landscape in sustainable city and region planning.

 **Redefining landscape – Policy decisions informed by research evidence led to a new planning approach in the West Midlands.** 

 <ins>Regional development of the Black Country \(West Midlands, UK\).</ins> 

 Moore was commissioned by the Black Country Consortium \(BCC\) to deliver the *Broadening Horizons* report, a strategic plan drawing on research from OTV \[R01\]. Moore’s landscape\-scale vision and exploratory graphics frame the whole Black Country as an ‘Urban Park’. The report contributed significantly to the shared statutory development plan: the Black Country Core Strategy \(S01\). Chief Executive of the BCC comments that *“as a consequence of this research, the Black Country is unique among Local Enterprise Partnerships in having a unified, endorsed Core Strategy”* and that Moore’s cross\-region plan resulted in a “ *deeply integrated approach to transformation between and across the four metropolitan authorities of the Black Country”* \(S02\). 

 Moore’s research \[R01, R03\] also highlighted the international significance of the region’s unappreciated and forgotten industrial heritage and geology; BCC Chief Executive said that Moore’s work; 

 *“helped us to envision the region’s topography in relation to its diverse ecosystems \(above\), a network of local, regional and global vistas \(beyond\) and the underlying geology \(below\). This new way of looking at our landscape emboldened Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton Councils to apply for UNESCO Geopark status in recognition of the region’s geological diversity and its role in the industrial revolution. In July 2020 UNESCO confirmed the Black Country as a Global Geopark \- a place with internationally important geology and because of its cultural heritage”* \(S02\). 

 <ins>A new</ins> <ins>model</ins> <ins>of National Park</ins> <ins>endorsed by the UK government:</ins> <ins>West Midlands National Park</ins> <ins>\(WMNP</ins><ins>\).</ins> 

 The redefinition of landscape presented in OTV \[R01\] has, according to a member of the Government’s Landscapes Review panel, **“** *had an extraordinary impact on perceptions of what National Parks are*” \(S03\). Moore’s exploratory maps \[R03\], presented a vision for a different kind of National Park that celebrates the ‘everyday’ landscapes of the region. These propositions are cited in the UK Government’s Landscapes Review as *“a way of getting people to act and think differently”* \(S04\) **.** A member of the review panel notes that; 

 *“the review’s report, quite remarkably, endorsed the application of National Park principles to cities. That we did so was due directly to Professor Moore’s vision and maps* \[R03\]. *This shows how, by reframing the way we think about National Parks, urban populations could benefit”* \(S03\). 

 The West Midlands Combined Authority \(WMCA\) adopted the WMNP programme via the 2041 WMCA Actions for Climate Emergency policy. WMCA Mayor praised it for *“changing the way we think about the environment, our health and the way our economy grows”* \(S05\). 

 The research has impacted culturally, prompting The Guardian Feature Writer Stuart Jeffries to write; 

 *“Not since Mayor Joseph Chamberlain sought to make Birmingham the new Athens at the end of the 19th century has anyone round here dared to dream this big”* \(June 20 2018\). 

 Media debate brought public awareness about the region’s culture to a wider audience as featured on amongst others, BBC One’s ‘Inside Out’ \(October 2018\); BBC Costing the Earth \(November 2019\); BBC Midlands Today \(October 2018\); and Digbeth Conversations \(May 2018\). 

 **Influencing environmental and design standards for a globally significant infrastructure project: HS2** 

 Research demonstrating that landscape is the driver and sustainer of holistic development \[R01, R02, R05\] together with Moore’s HS2 Vision \[R02\] has, according to Vice Chair of the HS2 Independent Design Review Panel; 

 *“persuaded HS2 to set up the Urban Integration team in 2018 to maximise the opportunities from integrating the line with its urban surroundings. This is delivering ground\-breaking insights and opportunities along the whole route*” \(S06\). 

 The same source confirms that Arup was “ *commissioned to re\-write the* \[HS2 Landscape Design Approach\] *document based on the approach articulated by Professor Moore, linking social, cultural, environmental and physical issues”.* Furthermore, Moore’s chairing of the HS2 Landscape Specification Working Group was key to this integrated landscape\-approach becoming incorporated into the overarching HS2 Design Vision \(S07\) which is used by every design team across the multi\-billion pound HS2 project. 

 The research was used in parliamentary speeches by former MP for Solihull to highlight the *“enormous opportunity that exists to do something ambitious, at scale, to offset the loss of green space of the type referred to in the amendment”* to the High Speed Rail \(London \- West Midlands\) Bill on 20 Feb 2017. 

 **Redefining perception – Challenging conventional wisdom and stimulating international debate within United Nation \(UN\) agencies.** 

 Moore’s definition of landscape based on new theories of perception \[R01\] was integral to the proposal for a UN legal instrument, the International Landscape Convention \(ILC\), as outlined in a speech to IFLA and taken up as a project within the Montreal World Design Declaration as the International Landscape *Covenant* \(S08\). Work on the ILC  led to the development of regional versions which are now policy in Asia Pacific and Africa, the latter of which “ *formed the basis of the African Landscape Network … which IFLA has been awarded a UNESCO Participation Programmer grant*” \(President, IFLA Africa\) \(S09\). 

 The research \[R01\] that challenged the nature/culture, tangible/intangible dichotomies is being used by UNESCO to monitor cultures’ contributions to the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainability Development Goals \(SDG\) via the Culture for Development Indicators Suite \(CDIS\). Former UNESCO Assistant Director\-General for Culture states that; 

 *“The CDIS seeks to address the issue precisely Moore articulates, the artificial distinction that is made between tangible and intangible heritage currently enshrined in two UN Conventions – the 1972 UN World Heritage Convention and the 2003 UN Intangible Heritage Convention, as well as in the traditional distinctions made between culture, economy and sustainable development in other UN tools and practices. The CDIS reflects a paradigm shift, supported by Mrs Moore’s research”* \(S10\).

 PV Live is Great Britain’s national\-level solar photovoltaic \(PV\) electricity monitoring service. It is a ‘cornerstone’ of our electricity system, used half hourly by National Grid Electricity System Operator, as well as by commercial energy forecasters, distribution grid control room operators, energy services companies, energy traders, policy makers, and as a public information source in the recent, rapid, decarbonisation of electricity. 

 It is underpinned by PV systems research undertaken between 2010 and 2015 and was then implemented as a web\-based data service between 2015 and 2020, all by the Sheffield Solar research group at the University of Sheffield. 

 Upon its inauguration in April 2016, PV Live led to a reduction in National Grid ESO’s daytime electricity demand forecast error and, as a result, has since saved consumers a total of approximately \[Text removed for publication\].

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Between 2010 and 2019, approximately one million individual solar photovoltaic \(PV\) systems, with a total rated capacity of \~13 GW, were installed across Great Britain. They are able to produce up to \~10 GW of electrical power or up to \~30% of the total national electricity demand. This power is either consumed near the installation site or exported into the national electricity network. The overall impact of the embedded solar PV is to reduce the demand for centrally supplied electricity \(displacing gas and coal\) and reducing carbon emissions. 

 Prior to 2010, the state of the art research relating to the field performance of solar PV systems in the UK was the 2006 Department of Trade and Industry funded  [<ins>BRE Domestic Photovoltaic Field Trial</ins>](https://www.bre.co.uk/filelibrary/pdf/rpts/PVDFT_Final_Techn_Report.pdf). In this study, around 400 systems were installed across the UK and best practice in terms of installation and operation was learned. The impact resulting from these field trials and the associated work was submitted by the University of Northumbria as a REF2014 impact case study. One key conclusion of these field trials, that will be referred to later, was that a typical domestic UK PV installation could generate 770 \(\+/\- 100\) kWh / kWp per year. 

 Beginning in 2010, **Buckley** founded the Sheffield Solar research group, spurred by recent investments in PV technology by the UK government. In 2010 **Hall** and **Buckley** developed a citizen\-science database \[R1\] for UK PV system owners to log their own PV electricity generation. The goal was to build public and market confidence in PV systems through a public dissemination tool. These public sourced measurements enabled a step change in research on the performance of the UK fleet of systems and a platform from which to research the integration of PV into the wider national energy system. From 2011 to 2016, **Buckley** led £1.3m EPSRC funded “Solar Energy in Future Societies” to explore the socio\-technical future of PV and between 2013 and 2017 **Buckley** collaborated with colleagues at Manchester and Loughborough in £1.1m EPSRC funded “Whole System Impacts and Socio\-Technical Integration of Wide Scale PV”. These projects mapped in much more detail the actor\-networks of data, organisations and people involved in the UK PV supply chains \[R2, R3, R4\] and the citizen science database grew by extending data donation to commercial system and equipment operators such as E.ON, Passiv Systems, Energence and Enphase. By 2017 it included historical and live data for over 20,000 systems. As a result, a much more detailed statistical analysis of PV performance was possible, but also, much of the basis of the information system that was needed to build a real time PV monitoring service \(i.e. PV Live\) was developed. 

 Specifically, system performance research performed by **Colantuono**, **Everard**, **Buckley** and **Hall** revealed in much greater detail than the existing state\-of\-the\-art how compass orientation, tilt angle, system size, mounting systems and local micro\-climate associated with PV systems contribute to the overall accuracy of models that predict the electricity generation of the system \[R5\]. Critically for PV Live, **Taylor**, **Buckley** et al \[R6\] reported how modules degrade year on year once in the field, and also how the initial performance of systems improve year on year relative to their specified efficiency. These numerical findings are used in PV Live to adjust the as\-calculated national yield by the age and installation date of individual systems. By 2015 **Buckley**, **Taylor** et al \[R6\] found that the yield of the average UK PV system had improved by \~15% from the 2006 trials and could now generate 900 \(\+/\- 70\) kWh / kWp.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 PV Live was developed between 2015 and 2020 with funding from National Grid ESO. It comprises three key processes. The first is tracking the location and capacity of all the PV systems in Great Britain by synthesising and cleansing multiple government and commercial datasets such as the Feed in Tariff register and the Renewable Energy Planning Database. The capacity is scaled using outputs from \[R5\] and \[R6\] to adjust for system degradation and installation date. The second process is to stream a sample of real time PV generation data and calculate a geospatially resolved normalised PV yield that can be used in the third process to scale up the national capacity to compute national and regional outputs. All three processes have been operated by Sheffield Solar since 2016 as part of the PV Live service delivery. 

 PV Live has had economic and societal impact in three ways. 

 1. Impact of PV monitoring on National Grid ESO energy forecasting and grid balancing 

 National Grid ESO is the electricity system operator for Great Britain. They ensure that customer demand for electricity is met with a continuous supply, operating within specific frequency and voltage boundaries. This balance is achieved by operating several electricity markets. The rise in renewable energy has introduced a free but uncontrollable electricity generation element \(i.e., wind and solar PV systems\) that reduces the amount of generation that needs to be purchased, but also, critically, reduces the accuracy of electricity forecasting used to manage the markets. To forecast solar PV output accurately, National Grid ESO needs to be able to measure it precisely. This requirement led to the development of PV Live. 

 In April 2016, National Grid ESO started using PV Live. The immediate impact was a 130 MW reduction in the average demand forecast error \[S1a, S2\] that was significant enough to be reported as a case study in the 2018 Electricity Network Innovation Strategy \[S1b\]. PV Live has since been evaluated by the National Grid ESO demand forecasting team to have made a ‘critical’ \[S2\] service contribution to the management of the electricity system with multi\-million pound per\-year savings \[S2\]. The combination of demand forecast saving \[S1b\] and reserve holding costs \[S3\] lead to a consumer saving \[Text removed for publication\] between 2016 and 2020. 

 Of additional significance is the role of solar PV in the recent decarbonisation of the electricity sector. In 2015, 443 gCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh of carbon emissions was produced by electricity generation, but in 2018, this amount had reduced to only 248 gCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh, as coal\-fired generation was displaced by wind and solar PV systems. PV Live not only indirectly contributed to reduced carbon emissions by supporting PV deployment through the provision of a trusted information source that reports yearly solar PV generation, but also had a direct impact by reducing the demand forecast error and consequently mitigating reserve capacity holding. Without PV Live, an additional \~130 MW reserve capacity \(normally diesel generators\) would have been needed between 2016 and 2019, adding approximately 10% \(or 14,000 tCO<sub>2</sub>e per year\) to the carbon output \[S4\]. 

 2. Impact of PV Live as a public information service 

 PV Live is a key source for public data relating to PV electricity generation in Great Britain. Via National Grid ESO it becomes part of the public record of the electricity market through the ‘Balancing Mechanism Reports’, managed by Elexon Ltd. \[S5\]. In addition, PV Live feeds directly into a series of public\-facing websites and energy tracking tools that include ‘MyGridGB’ \(14,400 Twitter followers\), ‘Gridwatch’, National Grid’s ‘CarbonIntensity’, Drax’s ‘ElectricInsights’ \[S5\] and media reports of solar\-related energy events such as new records for maximum PV generation and periods without coal \[S6\] \(such as The Guardian on 26/5/17, inews on 3/1/19 and BBC on 17/5/17\). Since 2017 PV Live has been used by Energy Sparks \[S7\] to provide virtual monitoring of PV systems in hundreds of schools, in order to embed sustainability education in the curriculum. The societal impact of PV Live as a result of these information sources is complex but helps public understanding and supports market confidence in the transition to net\-zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. For example, solar PV has the highest public perception rating of any electricity generating technology, and PV Live has made a strong positive contribution to the provision of reliable and timely information during the energy transition \[S8a, S8b, S5, S7\]. 

 PV Live is also used by The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) to fulfil statutory requirements for energy monitoring \(for example to the International Energy Agency \[S9\]\) and also to improve on existing approaches to monitoring and tracking. BEIS also \[S9\] report the use of PV Live data in 2020 improvements to renewable capacity tracking and, during the early stages of the COVID\-19 pandemic, when very sunny days and low demand required swift action by OFGEM to balance the system through the development of a new electricity market, the Sheffield team were consulted to reduce sources of uncertainty in PV output \[S9\]. 

 3. Impact of PV Live on energy services companies 

 Since 2016 PV Live has grown a commercial user base of hundreds of organisations. \[S10a\] is a list of 59 specific use case requests and \[S10b\] Google Analytics data showing 3,000 unique PV Live web site visitors each month. Industrial users take both real\-time and historical data for various operational functions in network balancing, forecasting and energy trading as described by the information requests in \[S10b\]. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 One of many new businesses that are supporting the net\-zero\-carbon energy transition by providing a range of services that assist in balancing electricity supply and demand in light of the growing contribution of renewables. They use PV Live data on an hourly basis to plan how they operate electricity generation, consumption and storage assets at the premises of their customers and see PV Live as a “cornerstone” of the emerging net\-zero electricity system \[S8a\]. 

 PV Live is also widely used to train energy forecasting models that are used to make real\-time decisions in terms of balancing services. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 A European weather and energy forecast service provider, uses PV Live to train PV power forecast models that they then sell to companies \[Text removed for publication\]. Through the use of PV Live, they have been able to reduce the error on their forecasts by 25% between 2018 and 2020 \[S8b\]. Being an international company, \[Text removed for publication\] was able to report the ubiquity of PV Live across not only the UK but also in Europe, stating that “almost every energy trading company” currently uses it.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Francesca Gains’ research into gender and policymaking has **informed governance arrangements** and **influenced public policy** in Greater Manchester \(GM\) since the devolution deal was signed by 11 white men in November 2014. It has: 

1.  Set the policy agenda on the under\-representation of women in GM’s policymaking processes and city\-region cabinet. 

1.  Informed and influenced arrangements to amplify women’s voices in policymaking in GM through engagement with policymakers and campaigners. 

1.  Shaped the Equalities Strategy in GM pre\- and post\-COVID and the terms of reference for a new Women and Girls’ Equality Panel in GM by bringing together an evidence base. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 These impacts are underpinned by research conducted at the University of Manchester \(UoM\) since 2010, led by Professor Francesca Gains. Key research findings demonstrate the need to stimulate policy debate and campaign on the under\-representation of women in the GM devolution arrangements. 

 Award\-winning research conducted by Gains between 2010 to 2013 with Claire Annesley \(UoM until 2014\) and Isabelle Engeli \(Ottawa\) examines what happened when gender equality measures reached Government policy agendas in five European countries. It demonstrates that **policy measures to improve gender equality are difficult to get on government agendas** \[1\]. This research \(drawing on the Comparative Agendas Project \(www.comparativeagendas.net\) international data set\) shows that the key determinants which led to gender equality measures getting space on the agenda **are women’s representation in legislatures and their presence in executive roles** \(in Government\). 

 As well as the need to have diversity in political leadership, earlier research into policymaking on gender equality in the UK core executive \(with Annesley\) also finds that the ability of female politicians to bring forward government measures improves once they **have developed internal networks and equalities** **processes** \[2\] **.** The improved representation of women in the New Labour governments led to greater attention to gender equality. Furthermore, the ability of female politicians in the executive to bring forward government measures improved once they develop **an equalities cabinet committee** and are supported by a **policy machinery to gather evidence on equalities to inform policymaking**. 

 Later research conducted by Gains with Vivien Lowndes \(University of Birmingham\) provides further support that for the finding that **having women in decision\-making positions is key to securing policy action** \[3, 4\]. In a research project that formed part of the European Research Council \(ERC\)\-funded project ‘Understanding Institutional Change: A Gender Perspective, 2012\-2017’ \(i\) led by Professor Georgina Waylen at UoM, Gains and Lowndes examined how Police and Crime Commissioners \(PCCs\) prioritised \(or not\) the problem of violence against women and girls \(VAWG\). PCCs, like metro mayors, are directly elected and operate at the sub\-national level with delegated powers and budgets, similar to the governance arrangements that were then developing under metro mayors. Indeed, in GM the Mayor took over the powers of the PCC on taking office in 2017. 

 The research finds that female PCCs were twice as likely as their male counterparts to ensure VAWG was prioritised in PCC police and crime plans \(which set local priorities\). The **importance of an equalities policymaking, evidence gathering, and reporting process** is also seen in this research. Those PCCs – men and women – who took equalities duties seriously were nearly two and half times more likely to prioritise the problem of VAWG \[3, 4, 5\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 GM has a population of 2,700,000 – similar to that of Wales – and is a leading exemplar of devolution for the rest of England’s combined authorities. From the announcement of the GM Devolution Deal in November 2014 and throughout the Mayor’s first term of office \(election postponed to 2021 due to Covid\-19\), Gains strongly pushed for having women’s voices in policymaking in GM both in political leadership roles and in the policymaking process, and sought to embed research findings into the evidence base of equalities processes. This had three key impacts: 

#  1. Set the policy agenda on the under\-representation of women in GM’s policymaking processes and city\-region cabinet 

 Between November 2014 and April 2017, drawing on the key research findings, Gains set the policy debate on the under\-representation of women in GM devolution. This resulted in **greater female representation,** including the appointment of **a female deputy and a gender\-balanced cabinet.** 

 Gains argued in numerous contributions to public debate and in legislative consultations for three necessary developments in GM devolution arrangements: 

1.  improvements in policymaking processes to ensure **under\-represented groups** **have a voice in policy development**; 

1.  the executive functions of the mayoral and combined authority cabinet should better reflect diversity, including the appointment of a **female deputy** and **expanded gender\-balanced cabinet portfolio** roles; and 

1.  equalities **evidence to be included** **in policy development** and evaluation. 

 Gains presented these arguments in public panel discussions with the Interim GM Mayor Tony Lloyd \(2015\) and Andy Burnham MP \(then Mayoral candidate\) \(2016\) \[A\]. Deputy Mayor, Bev Hughes, testifies that Gains’ research has “ *influenced and informed arrangements to get women’s voices into policy making*” \[B\]. Amy Foots, Head of Implementation at Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\) notes that “ *Gains research has been instrumental in progressing the gender equality debate in Greater Manchester*” \[C\]. 

 Gains also influenced the ‘DivaManc’ campaign to develop the mayor’s manifesto commitment to a gender\-balanced cabinet in 2016. According to DivaManc’s co\-founder and councillor Eve Holt, Gains research *“enabled us to build a strong case for change and put forward clear, meaningful and achievable asks of GM leaders. Her work and thinking has added academic rigor and clarity which has been able to cut through and deliver tangible progress”* such as *“the **appointment of a female Deputy**”* \[D\]. 

 Gains’ research also influenced wider campaigns to ensure a gender\-balanced cabinet in GM in collaboration with the Fawcett Society and Local Government Information Unit \(LGIU\) for their  [Local Government Commission](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/policy-research/local-government-commission/) – a year\-long study which asked ‘Does Local Government Work for Women?’. Sam Smethers, CEO of the Fawcett Society, states that Gains’ research and contributions “ *aided us in formulating the specific recommendations in our final report about increasing the number of women around the table when decisions are made, which were aimed at the combined authorities and Mayors*” \[E\]. Smethers also attests to the influence of Gains’ research into **Police and Crime Commissioner** \(PCC\) arrangements \[3\] when making the case for the positive impact that women in positions of power in local government can have, such as on the prioritisation of tackling domestic violence. These findings were cited in the media in the lead up to the 2017 mayoral elections, evidencing the influence of Gains’ research on the importance of equalities briefs in combined authorities \[F\]. 

#  2. Informed and influenced arrangements to amplify women’s voices in policymaking in GM through engagement with policymakers and campaigners 

 Following the election of the new mayor, Andy Burnham, Gains continued engagement with policymakers and campaigners informed and influenced arrangements to amplify women’s voices in policymaking in GM. This in turn helped shape the development of a scorecard for equal participation and influenced campaigns for gender equality in Greater Manchester. 

 After meeting Helen Pankhurst, founder member of the Greater Manchester for Women 2028 group, in April 2018, Gains joined the steering committee for a campaign led by Pankhurst \(GM4Women2028\) to address continuing gender inequality in GM. Pankhurst writes that Gains helped to develop “ *a scorecard to track a range of equality indicators”* \[G\] and “ *influenced the choice of the scorecard for participation in suggesting a gender balanced mayoral cabinet as a key equality measure in Greater Manchester’s devolution arrangements….*\[This\] *provide\[d\] a focus on a critical representation indicator **which her research shows will ‘unlock’ other policy outcomes through better and more diverse representation inside the combined authority"" \[G\]. Pankhurst states that Gains brought *“together campaigners, policymakers and researchers to share knowledge of how to get all women’s voices into policymaking...* \[which\] *will **build capacity, knowledge and vital networks to support the policymaking process around equality in Greater Manchester**”* \[G\]. 

 Gains produced an **influential research\-informed guide**,’ Mind the Gap: Getting Women’s Voices into Policy Making’ \[H\]. As Amy Foots, Head of Implementation at Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\) states, *“The publication provides an important contribution to the debate on gender equality and is helping to drive our work forward on this agenda in GM”* \[C\]. According to the Deputy Mayor, Bev Hughes, this publication established “ *a strong foundation upon which our priorities for turbo\-charging women and girls’ equality can flourish”* \[B\]. Pankhurst further notes that it “ *influenced the approach taken by the* \[GM4Women2028\] *campaign to working with the newly established Greater Manchester Women and Girls’ Equality Panel”* \[G\]. 

#  3. Shaped the Equalities Strategy in GM and the terms of reference for a new Women and Girls’ Equality Panel in GM by bringing together an evidence base 

 Gains’ research finds that networks of campaigners and policymakers are needed to bring together the evidence base needed to drive changes in the policy infrastructure and equalities policymaking \[3, 4, 5\]. As the mayor and combined authority governance arrangements commenced in June 2017, interventions by Gains, including the publication of *On Gender*, brought **together an evidence base** on gender to support an equalities strategy and more **permanent governance arrangements** that support equality considerations in policymaking. Bev Hughes, Deputy Mayor, notes that Gains “ *research on gender equality has been instrumental in highlighting the need for a more permanent piece of infrastructure to accelerate gender equality in Greater Manchester*” \[B\]. This led to **the establishment of a Women and Girls’ Equality Panel in the GMCA and the shaping of its terms of reference.** This panel **ensures that gender equality is actively considered in all GMCA decisions** and the wider Greater Manchester system. \(Gains was also selected to be on this panel\). Amy Foots, Head of Implementation, GMCA, further notes that “ *\[t\]he terms of reference developed for the Panel were also influenced by* \[her\] *research*”, in addition to her research being key to the establishment of the panel \[C\]. 

 Following the appointment of Bev Hughes as Deputy Mayor with responsibility for Policing and Crime in GM, Gains was invited to meet Hughes to discuss the underpinning research. In 2019, Gains was asked to join a new internal Greater Manchester Combined Authority **Women’s Voices Task and Finish Group,** that *“helped to shape and inform the establishment of a permanent Women and Girls’ Equality Panel and work programme”* \[D\]. For this Task Group, Gains brought together evidence based on her research with Vivien Lowndes \[3, 4\] and that of other relevant gender researchers at UoM to make the case that equalities policymaking was necessary across all policy areas. Of the resulting publication, ‘On Gender *’* \[I\], Hughes testifies: *“This research was an important contribution to the evidence base on gender equality in Greater Manchester and highlighted the importance of understanding how gender inequalities affect our region. It also informed the Group’s work programme, helping to target action and monitor progress”* \[B\]. 

 Gains’ policy brief, ‘Building Back a Gendered Better’ \[J\], highlights the gendered impacts of the pandemic and delineates measures to ameliorate these. This has influenced GMCA’s response to the pandemic. According to Foots, Head of Implementation in GMCA, it “ *has influenced the **post\-COVID\-19 recovery planning** for the Combined Authority and will help inform the agenda strategy for the Women and Girls’ Equality Panel as it develops its plans”* \[C\]. 

 Summing up, Holt states that the evidence base brought together by Gains *“highlighted the importance of listening to women’s voices in their full diversity throughout the policy making process”* \[D\] and Deputy Mayor Hughes attests that Gains’ work *“set gender equality **firmly on the agenda** in Greater Manchester”* \[B\].

 Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The constituent\-led and engaged approach to curatorial practice devised and implemented at Teesside University’s Middlesbrough Museum of Modern Art has stimulated sector discussion on the role of museums and galleries \(Arts Council England, Wellcome Collection\); shaped the curatorial practice of museums and galleries \(Galleria Moderna\) and enhanced cultural engagement and understanding with a diverse range of regional audiences through the design and development of exhibitions and events held at the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art on topics of importance to local audiences such as migration, regional industry, and the natural world, evoking resonant links between past, present and future through 57 exhibitions and 407 events.

 Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2014, researchers at the Centre for Creativity and Culture have undertaken curatorial research on the role of museums and galleries, developing and refining the concept of a “useful” and constituent\-engaged museum that is driven by regional approaches to, and understandings of, creativity, heritage, and place. Merging curatorial theory with curatorial practice, the research team have tested, embedded and shared their research through Teesside University’s Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art \(MIMA\). 

 Research\-led exhibitions at MIMA, such as <ins>Localism</ins> \(2015\), <ins>If All Relations Were To Reach Equilibrium This Building Would Dissolve</ins> \(2016\), <ins>This is Water</ins> \(2018\), and <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> \(2019\) have each sought to shift curatorial focus away from traditional and metropolitan notions of judgement, taste and legitimacy towards a self\-conscious, museum\-led ambition to “dig where we stand” \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]. The research of Hudson, Morgan, Amado and Stewart places engagement and education at the centre of their curatorial approach. Their research abandons the approach that emerged in the 1980s, still with us today, that sees arts initiatives as yoked to ‘enterprise’, new lifestyles and property regeneration across northern cities. This is a particularly provocative approach that unsettles widely held notions of regeneration, public engagement, and community work. 

 Taking forward the concept for Arte Útil developed by Argentine artist Eduardo Costa, <ins>Localism</ins> \(Hudson and Morgan\) interrogates the idea of the “useful museum” \[3.1\]. Taking a deliberately ‘localist’ approach to curation and working in partnership with regional communities to shape the exhibition, <ins>Localism</ins> enabled Tees Valley communities to reclaim the museum space. A ‘family tree’ of creativity on Teesside was established through the gathering of artefacts and artworks, and displays were regularly updated based on public feedback and contributions. A forum for public meetings, debates and conversations which were prompted by the exhibition was also provided. Some of the topics Localism addressed included Christopher Dresser and the Linthorpe Pottery, bridge building, the Boosbeck Industries in the 1930s and the existence of mima itself. Local artists were supported to set up workshops teaching skills such as furniture design, weaving and pottery making, skills linked to local heritage and the ‘forgotten’ trades of the region. 

 The exhibition <ins>If All Relationships Were to Reach Equilibrium, Then This Building Would Dissolve</ins> \(Amado\) builds on the ideas developed in Localism and explores the subject of migration on Teesside and elsewhere \[3.2\]. The exhibition brought together documents, artefacts and artworks made by Middlesbrough\-based asylum seekers and refugees as well as British and international artists. Working in collaboration with charities that work with Middlesbrough\-based asylum seekers and refugees, the exhibition went beyond awareness raising and formed part of an ongoing process of relationship building with local communities and organisations with the region. A key element of the exhibition and development of the format devised in <ins>Localism</ins> was the use of parts of the gallery as a centre for service provision, learning and debate. Free resources include a suite of computers with Internet access, a food bank, workshops, readings, film club, and awareness\-raising sessions, as well as activities for making and convening such as a communal weekly lunch, art classes and ESOL \(English to speakers of other languages\) courses. 

 Furthering this work, the exhibition <ins>This is Water</ins> \(Morgan\) explored the long histories of migration that have forged the current shape of the UK \[3.3\]. As a town founded on the rapid immigration of workers in the nineteenth century, Middlesbrough provided fertile ground for exploring the commonalities and shared experiences of immigration as well as changing identities and perceptions. By working with a formalised group of constituent advisers, the exhibition brought together art, personal memorabilia, and archival documents as well as materials from the North East Film Archives to give a nuanced portrait of the region’s migration histories. During the exhibition, a repository of the stories and voices from the Tees Valley was collated, creating an archive of marginalised voices highlighting the complex identities that form the Tees Valley region and transforming the nature of what constitutes a museum object. 

 In <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> \(Morgan\), global and regional perspectives are brought into dialogue through an exhibition focused on the exploitation of resources, trade networks and production of waste within the socio\-economic and ecological context of the Tees Valley \[3.4\]. The exhibition drew on 3 years of intensive research that foregrounded public dialogue between artists and ecology experts. Building on the idea of going beyond the exhibition, <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> consisted of a series of events and activities that took place across a whole year. The exhibition was used as a starting point to interrogate relationships between plants, animals and humans at a time of climate crisis and involved the work of 22 artists. This approach was combined with consultation with community groups through Design Thinking workshops and supplemented by interviews with international artists and curators. The result was a curatorial and community interrogation of colonial infrastructures, discourses in agriculture, botany, archaeology, as well as ecological conservation and technological determinism. 

 These exhibitions have been underpinned by theoretical and empirical research on curatorial theory and practice. <ins>The Constituent Museum</ins> \(Morgan\) examines the relationship between audience, expert and institution through an array of theoretical essays, case studies, and fictional writing. Morgan’s curatorial research informed the book’s conceptualisation \[3.5\]. Through sustained research spanning three years, Morgan edited texts, developed talks and staged a major conference, putting her research into dialogue with an international network of thinkers and influencing subsequent theory and practice. International contributors span specialisms in philosophy, education, social theory, art history and theory. 

 Work on art, critical pedagogy and capitalism \(Stewart\) has also furthered debates on both art and curatorial practice \[3.6\]. In this critical examination of art production, Stewart draws specific attention to the processes and context for art production. He argues that art practices with a social intent needs to involve a commitment to involvement to benefit those involved but not framed as participatory/participant through a critical understanding of the role of institutions, the contexts in which they operate, the bodies that occupy them, and the traditions, hierarchies and norms that influence how art and art institutions operate.

 Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art \(MIMA\) was incorporated into the University in 2014. It has provided the platform and mechanism for implementing this research into practice and for sharing practice\-led research. In 2015, Hudson wrote a 2015\-18 vision statement for MIMA that placed the idea of the “useful” museum at the heart of MIMA’s work. The aim was for MIMA to be ‘a place that is created and given meaning by the sum actions of all its users’ \[5.1\]. Through the exhibitions <ins>Localism</ins>, <ins>If All Relationships Were to Reach Equilibrium</ins>, <ins>This is Water</ins>, and <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> this ambition was tested, refined and realised, leading to MIMA’s 2019\-22 Business Plan that articulates MIMA’s renewed focus on “art in action” and a constituent\-engaged artistic programme \[5.1\]. Since 2015, MIMA has held 57 exhibitions and hosted 407 events. For context, MIMA receives 90,000 visitors a year. 

 Research\-led exhibitions and events exploring the idea of a “useful”, constituent\-led museum and held at MIMA have sought to provoke discussion on the role of museums, especially so in relation to community and place. MIMA’s work has led to representatives from both the Wellcome Collection and Museum of London visiting MIMA to learn more about their curatorial approach. For the Head of Engagement at the Museum of London, MIMA’s community board was particularly striking: ‘I was thinking about the community board and why it seems like such a radical thing to reach for – I’m glad to have it in my mind’s eye as an ambition to reach for’ \[5.2\]. According to the Acting Director of Moderna Galerija, Ljubljana, who led the EU New Mappings Project: ‘MIMA’s research into constituent\-led approaches to creating public forums for discourse with diverse communities was key to the development of the project…the network of organisations learnt from MIMA’s community programmes, including Community Day and the Cultural Conversations programme with new communities. Through discussions and workshops, we adapted these methodologies and approaches in each of our projects’ \[5.3\]. For a formal reviewer from Arts Council England, the <ins>Localism</ins> exhibition ‘was intended to be a provocative exercise, one designed to whip up debate about both what the function of the museum is and can be and, more specifically, what mima’s role might be in the specific geographical and economic landscape within which it is located \(and the challenges that come with that\). In that respect, it was extremely successful’. \[5.4\] 

 As a result of this constituent\-engaged approach to museum work, MIMA was included, in 2016, in the Calouste Gulbekian <ins>Foundation Inquiry into the Civic Role of Arts Organisations</ins>. MIMA was one of 80 international organisations to be featured in their case study bank that profiled best practice in civic engagement from around the world \[5.5\]. For the Director \(North\-North East\) of Arts Council England: ‘MIMA’s research\-informed approach to curatorial practice has led to a reinvention and challenging of the role of the museum, disrupting approaches within the sector. Seeing itself as a “useful museum”, MIMA seeks to influence society positively. For the Arts Council, this approach aligns well to our central mission of valuing the creativity of all, ensuring access to the arts and is one of the reasons for our continued investment in MIMA’ \[5.6\]. MIMA’s engaged approach was also cited by the Chair and Chief Executive \(Sir Peter Bazalgette and Darren Henley\) of Arts Council England in 2016 as part of the Countries of Culture inquiry, which launched in March to examine the wider cultural landscape. MIMA was selected as an example of the ‘growing contribution of universities, who want to make their local areas great places to work and study’ demonstrating the importance of MIMA’s work in rethinking not only the role of museums and galleries, but also the role Higher Education can play in community and civic engagement. This inquiry led to Arts Council shaping policies and approaches to building relationships with HEIs nationally. \[5.6, 5.7\]. 

 The exhibitions and their associated events \(talks, film club, lunches, and community days\) have also enhanced cultural engagement with modern art through a curatorial approach that centres the interests and needs of the local community. For the senior editor at FREIZE, a leading magazine of contemporary art and culture, MIMA provides a ‘powerful rejection of how the art world, too often, reduces activism to radical cosplay. This is an era in which political culture is being reformed in ways that may well be far more dramatic than what happened in the 1980s, and that’s the context in which mima proposes an articulation, rather than imposition, of a democratic cosmopolitanism, charting a progressive path out of here’ \[5.8\]. For a reviewer for Art Agenda, an online ‘publisher of rigorous and engaging writing on contemporary art’, the curatorial approach to <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> enabled news of engaging with and thinking about climate change and ‘provides a welcome example of how to make a meaningful, thoughtful, and deeply humane exhibition about the complex and emotionally charged issue of climate change in the twenty\-first century’ \[5.8\]. For a reviewer in the Gazette, Teesside’s local newspaper, <ins>If All Relations Were To Reach Equilibrium This Building Would</ins> spoke to the role museums can play in giving voice to marginalised communities: ‘For the many individuals fleeing Northern and Sub\-Saharan Africa, parts of the Middle East and other regions this is a huge platform to give a voice and an understanding to a plight; and the humanity behind these people forming a part of a multi\-cultured Teesside society’ \[5.8\]. This exhibition was subsequently featured on the Arts Council 2016/17 Annual Report as an example of an arts organisation ensuring ‘everyone has the opportunity to experience, and be inspired by, the arts, museums and libraries’. \[5.9\] 

 MIMA’s engaged approach has also contributed to the cultural offer of the Tees Valley, MIMA acting as an ‘important broker of sectoral discussion’. For the Creative Place Manager at Tees Valley Combined Authority: ‘Research undertaken by Teesside University researchers at the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art has made a significant contribution to our regional cultural offer, as well as local community engagement and cohesion. MIMA’s ethos as a museum owned and led by local communities drives positive change and the museum is a proactive hub where communities come together and reflect on ideas of place, culture, and identity. MIMA’s research\-informed outreach programme goes beyond the museum’s walls, working with schools, THIRTEEN Housing Group, and nursing homes to develop a deep and meaningful engagement on issues of migration, climate change and regional industry’ \[5.10\]. 

 MIMA’s role within the regional cultural economy of the Tees Valley is also seen through the continued investment and recognition of MIMA as a national portfolio organisation and for its important role within the North East \[5.6\]. Since 2014, Arts Council England have invested GBP4,086,056 in MIMA. More recently, an investment of GBP2,900,000 was made by Arts Council England’s Creative People and Places fund for a MIMA\-led Borderlands programme. The programme seeks to build cultural engagement in two areas of Teesside with extremely low levels of participation \[5.6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Heath and colleagues have defined the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the UK since 2000, including the risk factors for Group B Streptococcus \(GBS\), the most important cause. The work led directly to national guidelines for GBS prevention, major clinician and patient education, and also recognition of the need and potential for prevention through maternal vaccination. Heath and Le Doare have addressed the critical components in the pathway toward vaccine implementation on a global scale, including definition of serocorrelates of protection to enable licensure, optimal assessment of safety in pregnancy, cost effectiveness, and public acceptability. These have led to regulatory, WHO, and government endorsement, and major charitable and commercial investment.

#  Defining the epidemiology and disease burden related to Group B Streptococcus 

 Group B streptococcus \(GBS\) causes 90,000 infant deaths per year. Heath and colleagues have defined the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the UK. They undertook the first national surveillance study between 2000 and 2001 that established the burden of GBS disease, demonstrating that 53% of cases and 73% of fatal early\-onset cases had identifiable risk factors, including prolonged rupture of membranes and known maternal carriage of GBS \[1\]. The work led to a new national risk\-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis prevention strategy for early onset GBS \(see impact below\), and the establishment of a unique national neonatal infection surveillance network \( [www.neonin.org.uk](http://www.neonin.org.uk/)\). The St George’s\-led national surveillance of neonatal meningitis between 2010 and 2011 confirmed GBS as the commonest cause accounting for 50% of cases \[2\]. Repeat surveillance of GBS between 2014 and 2015 \[3\] identified further risk factors and preterm birth was incorporated into guidelines. In addition, the need for an alternative maternal vaccine\-based approach that would address both early and late onset disease was clearly established and the serotypes needed for 95% coverage defined \[3\]. 

#  Driving the strategy for maternal vaccine implementation 

 The group have led internationally in developing maternal vaccination strategies against a range of serious infant infections. Having established the limitations of current GBS prevention, Heath and Le Doare, with collaborators across the world, developed a pathway to maternal vaccination \[4\], and elicited support and funding from the WHO and The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The evidence for and guidance on maternal vaccination safety; cost\-effectiveness; maternal vaccine acceptability, and assay standardisation in order to facilitate vaccine licensure has been provided: 

# 1.  The safety of vaccination is paramount. Based on the largest UK experience of maternal vaccination \(St George’s has done more pregnancy vaccine trials than any other centre\), Heath has developed guidelines and standards for the assessment of safety of maternal vaccination through the international Brighton Collaboration GAIA project \(https://brightoncollaboration.us/gaia/\)\[5\]. 

1.  The group demonstrated the cost\-effectiveness of maternal vaccination in a UK\-based assessment, providing an impetus for ongoing vaccine development and facilitating decision making for vaccine manufacturers, and national and international policy makers \[6\]. Data from this analysis were considered at the Department of Health GBS expert advisory group in 2018. 

1.  The group has worked to establish parent and healthcare workers’ acceptability of maternal vaccination as a strategy for prevention of disease. They have done this through collaborations with relevant partners and public presentations \(i.e. SGUL Spotlight on Science events: vaccines for babies before birth, 28 June 2016\). Their patient partner initiative is consulted on all maternal and neonatal vaccine\-related studies nationally and they work closely with the national support charities: GBSS, Meningitis Now and Meningitis Research Foundation. 

#  Pathway to licensure of maternal GBS vaccines 

 The large sample sizes required for trials to assess maternal GBS vaccine efficacy constitute a significant obstacle on the pathway to vaccine licensure. Le Doare systematically reviewed evidence of protection based on immunologic data from vaccine and sero\-epidemiological studies, and was able to establish evidence for strong correlates of protection. Immune correlates are now considered to be pivotal for licensure, negating the need for very large sample size trials. Le Doare leads an international Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \(BMGF\) \- funded consortium \(GASTON\) to derive new standards for assessing the immunological responses to GBS and to develop standardised assays to assess serocorrelates of protection \[7\]. They are conducting UK \(MRC\-funded\), European and Ugandan \(EDCTP and BMGF\-funded\) studies to define serocorrelates of protection in the field.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  National guidelines, practice, and policy 

 Heath’s work in defining the national GBS\-disease burden and risk factors resulted in formulation and implementation of the first and then updated national guidelines for the prevention of early onset neonatal GBS disease based on intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics given to women with defined risk factors \[A \(RCOG Greentop guidelines 2017\), B\]. Prior to this, there were no agreed national policies to reduce GBS infection in infants. 

 The updated guidelines resulted in changes to the UK screening pathway, enabling more mothers to receive antibiotics during pregnancy and the likely prevention of many cases of GBS disease. Based on risk factors including mode of delivery, rupture of membranes and known carriage of GBS, 25% of live births were originally targeted for prophylaxis. In 2017, the addition of preterm infants as a risk group, resulted in an additional 7% of all live\-births being added to the screening pathway \[A\]. These numbers equate to approximately 160,000 mothers being eligible to receive antibiotics in labour in the UK per year, potentially preventing many cases of early onset GBS disease. 

 While the relative incidence of early vs. late onset disease, and the case fatality rate of early onset disease both decreased between 2014 and 2015 compared with surveillance between 2000 and 2001\(case fatality decreased from 10.6% to 5.2%\), the work also clearly established the need for a new strategy to address both early and late onset GBS disease. 

 This work culminated in Professors Heath and Le Doare’s membership of the UK Department of Health GBS research steering committee, which made recommendations for future research to prevent GBS in the UK \[C\]. These made clear the critical need for a new strategy focused on maternal vaccination, a body of work that the group is now leading. 

#  Impact on practitioners and patients: Educating clinicians and parents about neonatal meningitis 

 The group’s work to educate clinicians and parents about neonatal infection, meningitis and, specifically, GBS, has directly informed guidance nationally and internationally. The RCPCH, Meningitis Now and Meningitis Research Foundation have developed tools for the recognition and management of neonatal meningitis via online tools \[Da \(with over 1,000 hits\)\], clinical algorithms \[Db\] and patient information \[Dc\], which are all derived from this research \(please see testimonial letter from MRF\) \[E\]. 

#  Global Policy and Regulatory body endorsement of maternal vaccinations 

 Based on their contributions, both Professors Heath and Le Doare sit on the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) subcommittee addressing GBS vaccine development issues and have contributed to critical reports on the Preferred Product Characteristics and Vaccine Value Proposition, culminating in the WHO scientific advisory group of experts on immunisation \(SAGE\) agreement to prioritise GBS vaccine licensure for global use \[F, G\]. 

 Furthermore, they instigated a pivotal meeting between the GASTON consortium \(led by Le Doare, and funded by BMGF\) and the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) and the Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) in 2018. This resulted in acceptance of the principle of a pathway based on correlates of protection toward licensure of GBS vaccines, providing the support needed for policy makers to recommend its implementation \[H\]. 

 As a result, the US FDA, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\)/ EMA and WHO have endorsed the group’s proposed route to facilitate GBS vaccine licensure, representing a step change in the way that vaccines are licenced and facilitating potential accelerated licensure for other maternal vaccines. 

#  Impact on maternal vaccine safety 

 Professor Heath’s work with the Brighton Collaboration GAIA project resulted in the development of standards for assessing vaccine safety in pregnancy \[6 \(in research above\)\]. Professor Heath presented guidelines to the WHO Global advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety in June 2016.  The committee then recommended their widespread use \[I\]. These guidelines have been implemented as the gold standard for assessing maternal vaccine safety in clinical trials, facilitating maternal vaccine development for other important indications \(e.g. respiratory syncytial virus \(RSV\), pertussis \[I\]\), as well as GBS. 

#  Commercial impact 

 The group’s work to develop a pathway to a maternal GBS vaccine, endorsed by regulatory and global policy bodies, and backed by cost effectiveness data, has led to significant charitable and commercial investment. Funding for studies in the UK \(MRC\), Europe \(EDCTP\), South Africa \(BMGF\) and Uganda \(BMGF\) has been secured. Pfizer and Minervax, the two leading vaccine candidate manufacturers, are also undertaking phase 2b trials of their products, within the St George’s led EDCTP\-funded PREPARE consortium with results available by 2024 \[J\]. It is anticipated that these vaccine trials with immunological endpoints, known from the serocorrelate work to be protective, can lead to a vaccine being licenced by 2025.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Center for Migration, Refugees and Belonging’s \(CMRB\) work produced pioneering evidence of the widespread effects of hostile environment measures. This evidence: 

1.  influenced government’s policy and practice on country\-of\-origin evidence, health\-related immigration and return operations; 

1.  shaped anti\-hostility organisations’ health, education, accommodation, and immigration enforcement campaigns; 

1.  raised national and international evidence\-based understanding; 

1.  upskilled irregular migrants to become cultural producers. 

 Direct and indirect beneficiaries of the research range from forced migrants to racialised communities, and from anti\-hostility campaigning groups to governmental bodies such as the Home Office and the UN. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2010, UK legislation has substantially restricted access to benefits and services for non\-citizens. These multi\-faceted immigration measures, subsumed under the term ‘hostile environment’, were originally targeted at 800,000 \- 1,200.000 unauthorized migrants. However, as early as 2013, CMRB researchers exposed the unforeseen consequences of the policies to society, in particular to racialised people. 

 CMRB’s research was conducted across 16 locations in the UK, France, Italy, Rwanda, and Uganda with 3,331 research participants. The methods comprised of ethnographic observations lasting between 3 and 36 months, 34 focus\-groups with 374 participants, 16 arts workshops with 72 migrants, 2624 survey respondents, and 261 interviews. This research builds on CMRB’s distinctive expertise in intersectional and situated positionality. 

  

 Wemyss and Yuval\-Davis’s EU\-funded project Borders, Intersectionality and the Everyday \( **G1**\) was among the first to identify the effects of the hostile environment beyond its intended targets \- those migrants who have no legal right to reside in the UK. This transformed the nature of civic participation across society despite the public stance of the Government. 

 In 2014, Wemyss, Yuval\-Davis and their research partner coined the terms ‘everyday bordering’ and ‘everyday border guards’ as a lens to clarify the wider societal effects of borders and bordering processes, as they increasingly encroach on people’s lives \( **R1, R2**\). For example, health workers and welfare administrators are required to check the immigration status of all service users and racialised minorities with regular immigration status are denied access to services. Meanwhile, private citizens who are landlords or employers are turned into ‘border guards’ required to check immigration status. 

 Bhattacharyya’s ESRC project, Go Home: mapping immigration controversy, uncovered the racist impact of hostile environment policies, particularly the creation of an increased sense of precarity among racialised minorities independently of their immigration status \( **R3, G2**\). The collaborative street survey gathered the first systematic evidence that Operation Vaken, the Home Office scheme to encourage illegal residents to leave voluntarily, was having adverse effects on racialised minorities with legal settled status. Bhattacharyya’s AHRC Performing Memory upskilled migrant\-led groups in England and Italy to challenge hostile environment policies through cultural production \( **R4, G3**\). 

 CMRB projects address the international ramifications of the UK Government’s hostile environment policies. Wemyss and Yuval\-Davis found that Britain’s ‘everyday bordering’ practices negatively affect by migrants and locals living near the UK border in Calais, France. Doná’s long\-term research on global refugee movements \(R5, G4\) and in conflict countries such as Guatemala, Mexico, Uganda, and Rwanda \( **R6**\), demonstrates how the hostile environment policy is shaped by the conditions in countries of origin and intentional pressures and collaborations.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2013, CMRB findings have been used to substantially reshape key elements of policy and practice, limiting the effects of different components of hostile environment policies. 

 **1. Improving policy and practice about country\-of\-origin evidence for the Government** 

 Doná was invited to join the influential Independent Advisory Group on Country Information \(IAGCI\) \( **S1**\), whose recommendations are laid before Parliament. One of only ten invited experts, Doná has advised the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration \(ICIBI\) on the content and quality of Home Office country\-of\-origin evidence, which immigration officers rely upon when making case decisions. The evidence Doná provided significantly improvements to the quality of country\-of\-origin evidence produced by the Home Office for 17 additional countries over five years. Home Office policy and practice implemented 13 of 14 key recommendations of the ICIBI 2017 report. By clarifying eligibility for immigration status, Doná played a direct role in regulating the implementation of hostile environment practices at the Home Office. \( **S2**\) 

 **2. Raising awareness of the effects of bordering and shaping campaigning evidence for organisations, politicians, and migrants** 

 The novel concept of ‘everyday bordering’ reached audiences nationally and internationally through the online film Everyday Borders \( **S3a**\) and 36 public debates. Feedback showed that 93% of audiences achieved a greater understanding and 89% were motivated to take action “as a result of attending the event” \( **S3b**\). 

 In 2016, the team were invited to the Houses of Parliament to organise a discussion, Immigration Bills and Everyday Bordering, based on the national and political relevance of the research. Stuart C MacDonald, MP, testifies that “Everyday Bordering is a helpful term … the film shows how it affects all, which Parliament didn’t appreciate … we need to push back. All feel its effects” \( **S3c**\). MPs present subsequently signed the ‘MPs not border\-guards pledge’ in 2018 \( **S3d, S3e**\). 

 CMRB’s concepts shaped understanding and campaigning evidence by migrant health campaign groups in submissions to the Health Select Committee on Data Sharing and the Department of Health and Social Care on charging overseas visitors. ‘Docs Not Cops’ representative, Jess Potter, asserted: 

 *“My campaign work with Medact, Docs Not Cops, Migrants Organise and others and my writing of expert witness statements and policy responses have been strongly influenced by my understanding of the concept of everyday bordering”* \( **S4a**\). 

 Campaign work by Docs Not Cops and other organisations \( **S4b, S4c, S4d**\) use CMRB’s evidence to argue against these policies, resulting in the termination of the NHS Data sharing agreement with the Home Office in 2018 and the suspension in 2020 of the Immigration Health Surcharge. 

 Research findings informed campaigns among formal partners such as Southall Black Sisters on immigration raids \( **S5a**\) and others, including English for Action \( **S5b**\) in collaboration with Against Borders for Children and Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrant's \(JCWI\) campaign against hostile environment ‘Right to Rent’ policy \( **S5c**\). 

 Bhattacharyya’s ‘collaborative memory project’ trained 72 migrants with irregular status to become cultural producers, enabling migrant\-led organisations such as Global Sistaz United to campaign against the hostile environment beyond the scope of the project, at venues including New Arts Exchange, Nottingham in 2018 \( **S6a, S6b**\) and Kack Work Museum in Stockport in 2020 \( **S6c**\). 

 
**3. Underpinning evidence of the racist effects of hostile environment policies for activists and the UN** 

 Figure 1 'Go home' Van 

In 2013, Action against Racism and Xenophobia \(AARX\) was formed with Bhattacharyya to collaboratively gather the first evidence of the negative effects of the ‘Go Home’ vans and Operation Vaken on multi\-ethnic neighbourhoods \( **S7a**\). AARX’s ground\-breaking findings underpinned the successful public challenge by Refugee and Migrants Forum of Essex and London \(RAMFEL\) \( **S7b**\). The public debate \( **S7c**\) sparked by the controversy contributed to the cessation of Operation Vaken and the Home Office review of the impacts of future campaigns on racialised communities and migrants with settled status. \( **S8**\) 

 The pivotal findings resulted in external funding \( **G2, R3**\) to collate systematic evidence in Scotland and Wales. The nationwide evidence, publicly demonstrated in two films and open access resources \( **S9**\), was internationally significant. The UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism in the UK cited the findings in the End of Mission Statement, which was presented to the UN General Assembly as evidence of the racist effects of the hostile environment policies. The report stated that as ‘many members of the wider public have difficulty understanding the distinctions between legal and irregular immigrants’ and “many people reported harassment for being ‘illegal immigrants’ when they held settled status or were British citizens.” \( **S10**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Stephen Linstead’s ground\-breaking theoretical work on organisational aesthetics and the use of ‘critically affective performative texts’ underpins the innovative documentary film, *Black Snow*, directed by Linstead, in collaboration with the National Union of Mineworkers and the charity People and Mining. The film brings industrial history to life, increasing public awareness and understanding of a largely forgotten mining disaster involving 361 deaths. International reach is over 8.7million views. Local community impact includes a successful appeal and permanent memorial in South Yorkshire. The application of Linstead’s research also inspired a successful campaign for the annual UK National Workplace Day of Remembrance and over 150 primary schools now use *Black Snow* educational resources.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In recent years, an increasing awareness of the importance of human feelings, intuition, emotions and thoughts in organisational life has stimulated scholarly interest in organisational aesthetics \(OA\). Research in OA, much of it pioneered by Linstead at the University of York \(UoY\) **\[A\]**, has focused on the use of arts\-based methods, the influence of art forms on feelings and practices, and theoretical accounts of aesthetic phenomena in organisations. This field has attracted a growing community of critical management scholars with dedicated sub themes focusing on OA in major international conferences \(for example, the *European Group for Organizational Studies* \(EGOS\)\). 

 In an article published in *Organization Studies* **\[B\]**, Linstead noted that while interest in researching OA had grown, less attention had been given to using artistic forms, such as film, in the practice, presentation and analysis of management research. Linstead explained the potential these artistic forms have to capture and communicate the felt experience \(and tacit non\-cognitive knowledge\) of people in organisations and set out a number of theoretical principles for how to use art forms in research settings \- what he terms the *“critically affective performative text”* \(CAPT\). The CAPT framework draws on insights from anthropology, organisational communication and performance studies. It highlights how art forms, such as documentary films \(as performative texts\) can be employed to move audiences and stimulate new sensitivities, awareness and learning. This is achieved through the interplay of four ‘ *moments*’ which mediate how audiences respond to texts: the aesthetic \(relating to sensual experiences of how things appear\); the poetic, \(concerned with new discovery and insight\); the ethical \(how texts appeal to values and morality\); and political \(highlighting disparities, competing interests and the need for change\). 

 Linstead applied and developed these theoretical insights \(relating to CAPT\) alongside his expertise in historical analysis, to create documentary films. The aim was to use films as a form of performative art in practice, to move audiences and stimulate new sensitivities, awareness and learning. After appearing in the pioneering award\-winning documentary *Lines of Flight* \(Brown and Wood 2009\), Linstead experimented with his own films **\[C\]\[D\]**. Linstead’s first documentary, *These Fragments* **\[C\]**, applied some of the principles of CAPT to a treatment of the impact of mine closures and clearances on the South Yorkshire landscape. In *These Fragments*, Linstead created the form of a “video ballad” \- developed from his earlier work on “radio ballads'' \- that dispensed with a narrative voice and instead gave priority to the voices of respondents \(“actuality”\), sounds and music to heighten affect and immediacy. 

 Following the success of **\[C\]**, Linstead was invited by the National Union of Mineworkers \(NUM\) and the charity People and Mining to undertake a historical study in order to create an educational film about the 1866 Oaks Colliery Disaster. This disaster resulted in the deaths of at least 361 men and boys on 12th and 13th December, but had largely receded from public consciousness, even in South Yorkshire. Primary historical research in the NUM archives alongside secondary data and a meta\-analysis of source lists of victims provided the material to develop the film *Black Snow* **\[D\]**. A Heritage Lottery grant enabled the involvement of anthropological filmmaker Andy Lawrence. Working together to script and produce the film, Linstead and Lawrence used this work as an opportunity to further develop and refine the CAPT method. A major conference paper ‘Forgotten Heroes, Remembering Our Industrial Legacy and Reconstructing Marginalized Regions’ **\[E\]** based on the film won a Best Paper award from the *British Academy of Management* \(2018\) – the first time such an award has been given to a film. A further paper extending the arguments of **\[B\]** more specifically into the practice of organisation studies, was presented at the *EGOS* annual conference in 2019 **\[F\]**. Work continues with showing **\[D\]** to a range of academic, professional and public audiences, as a ‘live experiment’ to further refine CAPT as an innovative and potentially game\-changing approach to researching organisational aesthetics.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of this research arises primarily through the documentary film *Black Snow* **\[D\]**, co\-produced with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, National Union of Mineworkers \(NUM\) and People and Mining. Applying the principles of CAPT \(see above\) **\[B\]\[F\]**, the film has been successful in moving audiences locally, nationally and internationally, to stimulate new levels of public awareness and understanding of organisational history and its contemporary relevance. Additionally, with support from AHRC and ESRC grants, Linstead’s research has benefited communities in South Yorkshire and nationally, specifically through the creation of a permanent memorial, educational resources for schoolchildren and local and national historians, and a new national worker remembrance day. 

 <ins>Public Awareness:</ins> A central objective of the  CAPT approach is to move audiences and raise awareness and understanding. Linstead’s documentary film, *Black Snow* achieved this, changing the understanding of the local community and ultimately the wider public of a forgotten piece of industrial history. An initial public premiere attracted 400 attendees at the Parkway Cinema in Barnsley \(May 2017\), followed by a national ‘Black Snow Roadshow,’ incorporating music and spoken word performances, for a diverse range of venues \(13 to date\) **\[1\]**. Subsequently the film was broadcast on Together TV \(The Community Channel – European equivalent of PBS\) and received significant media coverage regionally and nationally \(newspapers, TV and social media\), including interviews on BBC Sheffield Radio and BBC *Look North* **\[2\]\[3\]**. Indications of success in changing public awareness nationally and internationally include over 80 international awards and nominations for the film – including awards for Social History, Industrial History, advocacy of Humanitarian Issues and for unearthing unsung International Heroes **\[1\]**. Remarking on Linstead’s award for Best Research Film of the Year at the Arts and Humanities Research in Films Awards 2018, the Academy of Social Sciences \(of which Linstead is a Fellow\) noted: *‘the film shows how an industrial past can have a tangible, emotionally powerful impact on the present – and even the future.’* **\[1\]**. Most recently, *Black Snow* was listed as a British Council Film further cementing its global reach **\[4\]**. 

 A formal evaluation conducted by the Institute for Public Understanding of the Past at the University of York, using independent data, calculated a non\-broadcast reach of 3,237, a print and digital reach of 3,353,490, and broadcast and Internet reach of 5,372,883 \(total 8,726,373, Dec 2020\) **\[4\]**. The affective impact of live performances/viewings was measured, and it was shown that over 88% of each audience were ‘moved’, entertained and informed by the film, which are core criteria for measuring impact on audience attitudes **\[4\]**. 

 The power of CAPT to move audiences towards new sensitivities, awareness and learning was especially strong for *Black Snow* among audiences with direct experience of coal mining. One local radio presenter, who spent his childhood in a pit village explained: “ *The Black Snow Roadshow CD really needs to be played in its entirety to unfold the full story... the thing that immediately struck me was the audience's community reaction to the unfolding tragedy of the Barnsley Oaks Disaster. During those performances I can best describe the atmosphere in the room, as an atmosphere I remembered from many years before… \[when\] The pit buzzer at Goldthorpe 'Sludge' pit went off when it shouldn't have. Every person in our street turned their heads, craned their necks towards the siren and furrowed their brows as one. It all went very quiet”* **\[4\]**. 

 Audience attitudes, captured by qualitative feedback, show them responding to the four ‘moments’ in Linstead’s CAPT framework **\[B\].** Typical comments included: *“It’s truly eye\-opening. The fiery recreation of the disaster evokes powerful emotions”;* “ *Extremely emotional – left me absolutely in tears – I can’t explain how good the film was to me”; “Very informative and emotive – left me shocked and angry”; “It made me want to send donations back in time to help those poor families”; “Powerful and watchable – amazingly moving and poignant”.* Changes in awareness and attitudes were noted by many audience members, with 95% stating they gained new knowledge and comments such as: *“It made me think differently – coal mining is a piece of our history we forget”; “A poignant and impressive tribute to the miners, rescuers and families, and an essential part of our  heritage”; “Brought home the reality of mining”;  “I had never heard of this disaster and it was explained so clearly and movingly – I will tell everyone back in Scotland”* **\[4\]**. 

 <ins>Creation of a Permanent Memorial:</ins> The increase in public awareness generated by Linstead’s documentary film contributed to the establishment of The Oaks Memorial bronze statue in Barnsley town centre. The film is named and images from it feature on the permanent information block on the statue **\[5\]**. According to the President of the Yorkshire NUM, *“the film was integral”* to the memorial project *“because people asked about it, its availability etc. when they were making donations, such was the interest it engendered*” **\[5\]**. The ‘Owd Miners’ Heritage Volunteer Group also stated: *‘The* *Oaks Memorial Appeal was by far the biggest undertaken in the UK and has provided a model for subsequent activities.’* **\[6\]** The success of *Black Snow* and the Oaks Memorial project has inspired other groups in the region to initiate similar campaigns, including the Thorne and Moorfields Colliery Memorial project, the Secretary of which stated: “ *Your \[Linstead’s\] high standard of achievement has set precedent to not only ourselves, but many other like minded memorial groups all working hard and hoping to follow in your \[Linstead’s\] footsteps.”* **\[6\]**. Volunteers who worked with Linstead on the Oaks Memorial have been inspired to contribute to other projects including the Stanley Memorial \(""Archie's Wheel""\), and the Temple Newsam ‘Blot on the Landscape'' Memorial Project \(national winner of the British Museum Volunteers for Museum Learning Award 2019\) and several continuing projects at Featherstone, Lupset, Wrenthorpe and the 125th Anniversary of the Peckfield Disaster. 

 *Black Snow* and the Oaks Memorial have also changed attitudes of descendants through their restorative value. Descendants testify to how the public recognition of their ancestors’ sacrifice helped them to come to terms with their family histories and provided a sense of closure. For example, a descendant of Parkin Jeffcock \- the heroic engineer who led the rescuers and perished in the disaster \- wrote: *‘Tragedy happens much too often and it is human nature to try and forget it, but it is right to remember and to think through visualization about those who died in very hard circumstances’* **\[7\]**. Another family member, a descendent of Henry Jackson, killed with his two sons John and William in the first explosion at the Oaks, explained: ‘ *I have always been told some of my ancestors perished in the blast but actually hearing how it happened gave me an insight into the horrors of it that were unimaginable before. It makes me think about my great, great grandma and how she coped afterwards not only financially but emotionally’*’ **\[7\]**. 

 <ins>Impact through Educational Resources:</ins> A limited edition package \(including DVD\) of the film *Black Snow*, the book *The Oaks Colliery Disaster 1866* and a CD of related music and poetry was made available free of charge for use in schools nationally and was distributed by the NUM **\[5\]\[8\]**. The film is permanently featured on the BBC website **\[5\]** and streaming is also possible from a dedicated website<ins>.</ins> Teachers from over 150 primary schools have requested and used these resources **\[8\]**. 100 school children from St Mary’s Primary and Burton Road Primary displayed work at the first annual memorial event on 12th December 2018. In the words of one pupil from Burton Road: *‘We have learnt so much about the mines and how dangerous it was for the people who work under those conditions…it was great to come today’* **\[3\]**. *Black Snow* inspired pupils attending this event to make a wreath out of black snowflakes which they placed on the memorial; some also wrote poems reflecting on what the disaster meant to them **\[8\]**. In the opinion of the NUM Education Officer and Archivist, the resources developed by Linstead fit the curriculum well, particularly at Key Stage 2 \(primary school\) and upwards **\[8\]**.  *People and Mining* conduct regular workshops in South Yorkshire schools, based on Linstead’s work. An example is the ‘Mining Day’ workshop held at Carlton Primary Academy in October 2018 involving 115 pupils, which received coverage in the local press **\[3\]**. The Education Officer remarked how pupils attending this event *‘were inspired to research their own family histories and came…with their own stories and artefacts, many of them also in period costume with authentic materials. For them and others the film has brought history to life’* **\[8\]**. More generally, regarding the educational impact of Linstead’s work, the NUM EO added: *‘it must be remembered that all the events, film, website and educational resources have had the aim of bringing the largely forgotten history of England’s worst colliery disaster back to prominence in the public consciousness. The outcome has been a massive success with a new generation of learners confidently reciting the stories and historic detail of the Oaks Colliery Disaster of 1866’* **\[8\]**. 

 In addition, Linstead’s research and documentary film supports higher level education and local historians by making the sources used in his study publicly available as a special collection at Barnsley Archives and Local Studies **\[9\]**. Confirming receipt of the collection of documents and d<ins>i</ins>gital files relating to *Black Snow* **\[D\]**, the Archives and Local Studies Manager at Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council wrote: *“The material donated has huge significance and I envisage it being used greatly for different types of historical research in the future….the collection will be fully catalogued and made accessible to researchers. We will also seek to promote it through our website and our online catalogue. Details of the collection will also be passed to the National Archives on our 2020 Return of Accessions, so will be promoted and highl<ins>i</ins>ghted through them too. We receive approximately 100 new collections of archives each year, but this is certainly one of the most significant received during 2020*” **\[9\]**. In addition, the film itself is permanently available nationally in the BFI Film Forever Archive and internationally at US based Films for Action ‘ *the largest library for social change online’* **\[9\]**. Curator at the BFI National Archive notes: ‘ *The BFI National Archive holds one of the world’s most important collections of factual filmmaking, and I am very pleased that Black Snow has been preserved in the Archive’s Digital Preservation Infrastructure, to be available for both future and current research.’* **\[9\]** 

 <ins>National Workplace Day of Remembrance:</ins> The wider reach of Linstead’s work is marked by the contribution to ongoing campaigns aimed at raising the profile of other forgotten communities in the UK. In the *Black Snow* film itself, one interviewee comments that if a big disaster like the Oaks can be forgotten, what hope could there be for the thousands of smaller incidents in which perhaps one or two people died, in any industry, but which were not even reported let alone remembered. Inspired by this insight, at the Labour Party Conference Fringe \(2019\), Linstead led a panel event that launched the National Workplace Remembrance Day Initiative, with participation and coverage by the *Daily Mirror*, and supported by the Sheffield City Region Mayor \(South Yorkshire – Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster\) **\[6\]**. The case was set out in a blog post by Linstead \(Workplace Remembrance\) for CLASS \(Centre for Labour and Social Studies\), and in an article by Linstead with historians Hughes, Miller, and Darlow \(Reframing History\) that featured on the AHRC ‘Read, Watch and Listen’ website. As a result, in 2019 the 12th December was successfully established as an Awareness Day \(annually\) and has its own website **\[10\]**. The UK National Workplace Day of Remembrance recognises all those who served the UK economy and lost their lives at work, whatever their job, whatever their level, whatever their industry. On 12th December it is celebrated by observing a minute’s silence and flying the Union flag at half\-mast on public buildings for the whole day. 

 In 2020, plans to organise a physical ceremony at the Oaks Memorial on the same day \(12 December\) were disrupted due to the Covid\-19 pandemic. However, as the Executive Director of Core Services at Barnsley Metropolitan City Council notes: *‘We will be happy to fly our flag at half\-mast on the 12<sup>th</sup> of December 2020 and…in future years we will lead the way on the 1 minute silence remembrance’* **\[10\]**. This event was also reported in the *Barnsley Chronicle*, a local newspaper **\[10\]**. Since 2017, the Together TV Channel has broadcast *Black Snow* **\[D\]** to mark the day, and will continue to do so, having extended its initial 3 year Worldwide Rights Licence until 2022. These developments are testimony to the wider reach of Linstead’s work which provided the CAPT framework **\[B\]** for how to move audiences towards new sensitivities, awareness and learning and then put it into practice through film, increasing public awareness of industrial history and helping to establish the significance of the Oaks disaster \(and other similar historical events\) **\[5\]**. As the Mayor of the Sheffield City Region stated: *“I am del<ins>i</ins>ghted that National Workplace Day of Remembrance is now established in the calendar as an Awareness Day, with its own website, and I hope to see increasing numbers of public buildings and private workspaces flying the union flag at half\-mast and observing a minute's silence on the 12th December each year as the tradition becomes firmly established. **This is entirely due to the public impact of the film and would not have been possible without it.**”* **\[10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact.** 

 Unelected lobby groups are important for government decision\-making and policy formation, but they face two challenges: first, many politicians are sceptical and even hostile about their legitimacy; second, they find it difficult to communicate their concerns effectively in a context of political change. Parvin’s research on the theory and practice of lobbying addresses these two challenges and has had two connected impacts: \(1\) It has increased understanding of lobbying  / public affairs among UK parliamentarians and government, helping to shape the policy / regulatory environment in which lobbyists work, and \(2\) It has improved the professional practice of a wide range of lobby groups in the UK and Australia, through organisational and policy change. The research has benefitted around 200,000 individual end\-users, including employees and members of companies and political organisations across the public, private, and charity sectors. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research.** 

 The impacts described in this case study were generated by an ongoing research programme carried out in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Loughborough University by Dr Phil Parvin. Dr Parvin, a political theorist with expertise in political lobbying and democracy, has over 15 years’ experience of working with lobbyists, campaigners, and parliamentarians. The research is driven by two questions: \(1\) What role do unelected lobby groups play in liberal democratic states and what role, if any, *should* they play? \(2\) How might lobby organisations more effectively communicate their concerns in a context of wider democratic change? 

 \(1\) Unelected lobby groups play an important role in liberal democratic states including the UK **\[R1**\]. This is both a good and a bad thing. On the one hand, they provide much\-needed expertise to generalist politicians, increase the representation of marginalised groups, and represent a bridge between citizens and institutions. On the other, they exist outside of formal democratic checks and balances, they are unelected and hence suffer a legitimacy deficit, and – empirical data suggests – disproportionately concentrate power in the hands of wealthy individuals and organisations. Parvin’s research analyses these tensions, and establishes the role that lobby groups have, and *should* have, in democratic societies. 

 \(2\) Parvin’s research also analyses how wider patterns of social and political change have affected the *role* of lobbyists and their *practice*. In particular, he researches how changing patterns of citizen participation have increased the centrality of lobby groups and changed their internal structure: as many citizens have become less politically active, many organisations have come to rely less on activist members to bring about political change, reorganising themselves as professionalised, hierarchical ‘interest groups’ which operate at the elite level **\[R2\]**. Parvin analyses the impact of economic inequality on the representation of marginalised groups by lobbying organisations and citizen participation **\[R3\]**, and researches the implications of unequal representation and political activity for democratic equality, inclusion, and decision making. He does so through critical engagement with contemporary research on democratic deliberation **\[R4\]**, as well as dominant approaches in political science to citizen participation, engagement, civic membership, and democratic expertise **\[R5\]**. 

 Parvin’s research is thus both normative and explanatory, as well as being grounded in the lived experience of lobbyists themselves: his theorising about the role of unelected lobby groups in democratic states is fundamentally shaped by empirical data and the practice of lobbyists themselves. The research employs a ‘normative ethnographic’ method: an exciting new approach in political theory in which normative conclusions are shaped by a deep grasp of empirical data produced by social and political scientists, but also the lived experience of political actors. This enables impacts to flow in both directions: normative arguments in the field of democratic theory are shaped by empirical reality and the day\-to\-day experiences of end\-users which means they can, in turn, speak to and help shape the practice of these end\-users. The research is thus enriched by dissemination in peer\-reviewed academic journals \(as indicated in the underpinning research section below\) and also outlets aimed at a wider audience of policy\-makers, think tanks, and lobbyists across numerous sectors.

 **4. Details of the impact.** 

 Dr Parvin was for five years \(2001 – 2007\) a professional public affairs practitioner, and then a Director at the Hansard Society. His research has shaped the regulatory and policy framework in which lobbyists operate for over a decade. His 2008 report *Friend or Foe: Lobbying in British Democracy* \(Hansard Society\) provided the definition of lobbying used by the Public Administration Select Committee in its inquiry into the issue, was quoted by David Cameron in his pre\-election campaign, and was instrumental in the shaping of the 2014 Transparency of Lobbying, Non\-Party Campaigning, and Trade Union Administration Act. Since 2001, Parvin has established his reputation among public affairs professionals, and an extensive network of contacts and external partners. Together these have afforded him access to key figures in UK public affairs and politics, and enabled him to develop strong **pathways** to use his research to help policy makers and public affairs professionals. The research undertaken in the current REF period has had two principal impacts. 

 **Impact 1: Shaped the policy and regulatory environment in which lobbyists work, and increased understanding of the industry among government** 

 Dr Parvin’s research has been instrumental in improving understanding of the UK’s £1.4 billion public affairs industry among government, leading to improved regulatory standards, and greater transparency across the entire public affairs industry. It has played a significant role in establishing regulatory codes of conduct and ethical guidelines used by over 2000 professional public affairs consultants and in\-house lobbyists. 

 As Gill Morris, Chair of the **Association for Professional Political Consultants** until 2018, reported, Parvin’s research **\[R1, R5\]** helped to “ *raise the status of the industry in the eyes of politicians, and also helped shape the regulatory framework in which the industry now works”*. The APPC was for 25 years the ‘principal representative body for lobbyists and the guardian for professional ethics’ with over 90 member organisations employing over 2000 individuals. Its central role was to ensure that lobby groups of all kinds were able to effectively campaign for political change transparently, within a clear and identifiable regulatory framework. The APPC’s work in this area endures in contemporary codes of conduct and regulation. Morris described the ‘ *considerable impact that Dr Parvin’s research into lobbying has had on the public affairs industry’* and on the regulation of lobbying. In particular, Parvin’s work on possible regulatory reforms, and the positive role of lobbying groups in societies characterised by wider democratic change, ‘ *has played a direct and important part in building advocacy for what we do*.’ His research 

 *‘supported and strengthened advocacy amongst member organisations. Doing so directly benefitted our 2000 member company: it helped me put the case for better regulation and to make the positive case to support UK lobbying and its value. As a result, codes of conduct are in place across the sector, there is more transparency and there is a better awareness among government, parliamentarians, and the wider policy making community about the role that lobbying plays in the UK, and its place in our democracy.’* **\[S1\]** 

 Parvin’s impact on policy debates is further corroborated by a senior member of the House of Lords. Lord McNally, Liberal Democrat peer and former lobbyist, describes how Parvin’s work has been: 

 *‘pivotal to the discussion within the public affairs industry among its practitioners, and beyond it among policy makers and other political actors. Public affairs professionals continue to find it useful in their own work, and in particular in their discussions about governance, regulation, and codes of conduct within the industry. Policy makers like myself have found it helpful as a source of clear and penetrating analysis on the ways in which lobbying fits in a democracy, and how we can ensure that it is practised ethically, transparently, and effectively in a changing political landscape’* **\[S7\]** 

 Finally, Marc Stears, Director of the Sydney Policy Lab, former Chief Executive of the New Economics Foundation \(NEF, one of the UK’s largest and most influential policy think tanks\), and former chief speechwriter for the Labour Party described Dr Parvin’s work as having ‘ *a significant impact on . . . debates within the policy making communities of the UK and Australia’,* as well as on his own work and professional practice, outlined in more detail below **\[S2**\]. 

 **Impact 2: Changed the way that think tanks, corporations, campaign organisations, and trade unions communicate with government, external partners, and their own members** 

 In addition to impacting UK policy debates, Parvin’s research has ‘ *influenced the role and conduct of public affairs professionals in the UK*’ \[Morris, **S1**\], transforming the professional practice of numerous individuals and organisations, from think tanks to some of the world’s largest global corporations. Through building close working relations with key individuals in a wide range of organisations, Parvin’s research has led to organisational change, and the development of new practices. 

  

 \(a\) For the New Economics Foundation think tank, Marc Stears, \(introduced above\) claimed that Parvin’s research **\[R2, R3, R4\]** shaped his practice, leading him to make fundamental changes to **NEF** and also the **Sydney Policy Lab** \(which he now leads\) <ins>realigning the way they communicate</ins> with other policy actors and their external partners. The research: 

 *‘had a demonstrable and wide\-ranging impact on how I do my job, and the activities and structures of the New Economics Foundation and the Sydney Policy Lab under my leadership . . . It has helped me to shape the research and campaigning activities of \[these organisations\] . . . As CEO of NEF and Director of the SPL . . . I re\-oriented our research programmes in ways which better tackle the reality that Dr Parvin describes.’* \[ **S2\]** 

 In particular, Parvin’s research 

 ‘*helped NEF to ground its ‘wellbeing economy’ campaign in a firmer grasp of the relationship between lobby/advocacy groups and patterns of participation. It also helped SPL to better pursue its core concerns of power, equality, and belonging . . . As CEO of NEF at a pivotal time in its development, and current Director of the SPL, I can say without a doubt that the impact of Dr Parvin’s research on these organisations’ research and advocacy work has been significant and far\-reaching.’* **\[S2\]** 

 Parvin’s research 

 ‘*improved my understanding of the challenges facing democratic states, changed my attitude to these challenges, and what solutions might be viable, changed my professional practice, by helping me to incorporate these ideas into research and advocacy \[at NEF and SPL\], . . . \[and, in doing so\] benefitted both NEF and SPL.*’ **\[S2\].** 

 \(b\) At **McKinsey & Company**, Steve John, Partner & Director of Global Communications reported that Parvin’s research into the changing role of citizens and organisations in UK democracy **\[R1, R2\]** as influential in his approach to his own role at the firm, changing the professional practice of a senior executive of one the largest consultancy firm in the world, employing over 30,000 people in 130 cities across the world. John’s role was, until 2019, to lead an international 350\-member team to ‘work with partners to protect and build the firm’s reputation globally’. John stated that through working closely with Parvin over a series of one\-to\-one and small group events, he learned how McKinsey could work more effectively with external partners and other policy actors. Dr Parvin’s research ‘helped \[him\] further understand the wider context in which businesses and other non\-state actors lobby for change’ in ways that shaped his own practice. 

 ‘*His insights into the ways in which changes in the political landscape can \- and should \- shape effective lobbying campaigns, have shaped my thinking, and I have drawn on his research in my own work . . . These insights have enabled me <ins>to</ins> <ins></ins><ins>connect</ins> <ins></ins><ins>with</ins> <ins></ins><ins>external</ins> <ins></ins><ins>partners</ins> by better understanding the challenges they face and what they need to succeed’.* **\[S4\]** 

 \(c\) Dr Parvin’s research has also impacted the practice of **trade bodies**, an influential class of organisation charged with representing industry and business interests in the political system. One example is the **Publishers’ Association**, the principal trade body for the £6 billion British book and journal publishing industry, with over 170 member companies. Dr Parvin worked closely with Chief Executive Richard Mollet, discussing his research findings with him **\[R2, R5\],** and showing him how the organisation might work more effectively with other groups to ensure that the interests of book publishers and authors are heard at the highest levels of government. Mollet describes Parvin’s research as ‘extremely influential’, providing vital background context to the wider lobbying efforts of his organisation. He suggests that Dr Parvin’s research was 

 *‘vital to \[his\] work as an advocate for the publishing industry at a time when it was coming under multiple pressures from online piracy, copyright reform and, in the case of academic publishing, emerging business models.*’ \[S5\]. 

 Mollet suggests that Parvin’s research 

 *‘confirmed the importance of alliance\-building and collaboration with partner organisations as a means of effectively seeking political change* . . . *His work prompted me to make important changes to our campaigns, and in the way we engaged with government, for example by <ins>introducing more social media and other online tools into our campaigning</ins><ins>’</ins>.* **\[S5\]** 

 \(d\) Finally, Parvin’s research **\[R4, R5\]** has been influential in the **trade union** sector, initiating demonstrable change in the practice of how unions communicate with their members, and with like\-minded organisations, in the interests of bringing about policy change. For example, Martin McIvor, Research Officer at the major trade union **Prospect** describes the significant changes that Dr Parvin’s work prompted in his organisation’s professional practice, transforming the way it communicates with its 140,000 members and seeks political change on their behalf. In a series of one\-to\-one meetings, Parvin and McIvor discussed the research in ways which enabled McIvor to implement changes in his own professional practice and implement positive changes in his organisation, including the 

 *‘introduction of <ins>new ways to facilitate collaboration</ins> with our members, to inform them of our activities on their behalf, and find out their views. For example, I have been involved in improving Prospect’s use of digital innovations such as platforms enabling members to easily contact their MP, and provide evidence and examples to support our national lobbying efforts, without creating undue or unrealistic demands on their time or familiarity with political processes.’* **\[S6\]** 

 It has also helped 

 *‘to improve and streamline our lobbying of government and other decision makers. For example, <ins>using social media to highlight and leverage commonalities of interest</ins> between Prospect and other civil society organisations engaged in lobbying government, such as environmental NGOs. These two changes alone,’ he says, ‘have improved the way we engage with our members and also the way we campaign in support of their interests.’* **\[S6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2005, Craig’s research around quantification of uncertainty has had a significant impact in the context of European food safety. Using a range of methods that include statistical modelling and reasoning, Craig has contributed to significant change in the way the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) addresses uncertainty in its scientific assessments for the EU Commission and member states. Quantifying uncertainty in these assessments plays a critical role in risk management decisions that relate to food production, packaging and consumption; ultimately protecting consumers, animals and the environment from food\-related risks.  Craig’s research has also contributed directly to the treatment of uncertainty in EFSA topic\-specific guidance and individual assessments. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Craig is a statistician who works mostly from the Bayesian subjectivist viewpoint on statistics. Craig’s research focus is on methodology for quantification of uncertainty in real world problems based on careful application of statistical principles and methodology and in\-depth knowledge of applications. Key components are Bayesian random\-effects modelling, imprecise probability and expert knowledge elicitation. 

 For the decade to 2002, Craig worked mostly on statistical methodology for computer models as part of a Durham group specialising in Bayesian emulation of computer models, use of expert knowledge elicitation to quantify expert judgement using probability, and statistical modelling of discrepancies between models and reality. Funding came from EPSRC and oil industry partners. The relevance to the case study is its focus on quantification of uncertainty about the real world based on deterministic and statistical models of data and elicitation of expert judgement using probability, laying the ground for the research and impact reported in the case study. 

 Since 2005, Craig’s research has largely been concerned in one way or another with quantification of uncertainty in relation to risk and benefit assessments in the context of food safety. Much of the research has been conducted with or for EFSA, often as a member of an EFSA working group. This has involved a diverse range of activities and applications; the common thread is quantification of uncertainty using statistical modelling and reasoning. The research has been published in academic journals and by EFSA in its own journal. Examples of relevant academic journal articles are \[R1\] \[R2\] and \[R3\]. 

 Publications in the EFSA journal are of several different kinds: scientific assessments in relation to risk \(or sometimes benefit\) of potential policy changes/actions, commissioned by EU state risk managers; guidance documents developed to influence the conduct of assessments; scientific opinions combining review of the relevant scientific literature with evaluation of how science can be brought to bear on areas of EFSA activity. Any of these may require development of new methodology or novel analysis and interpretation of data, and this may be included in the main text or appendices of the resulting publication. 

 Craig’s topic\-specific research, started in the EFSA context and contributing to impact, includes: 

-  Bayesian statistical modelling of pesticide residues in food, probabilistic modelling of dietary exposure to pesticides and assessment of cumulative risk from multiple pesticides in human diet \(see part 4 of this case study\). 

-  Statistical methods in ecotoxicological risk assessment, beginning with an EFSA Scientific Opinion for aquatic species \[R4\], and continuing in academic journal articles \(for example \[R1\] and \[R2\]\) and later EFSA scientific opinions for other species groups. 

-  Statistical analysis and reasoning for dermal exposure to pesticides. The research is contained in \[R5\], an appendix to the EFSA guidance document, written in collaboration with Dr Guillot of EFSA, and also in the report of an EFSA funded research project investigating the applicability of in silico methods of predicting dermal absorption. 

 Craig’s research on generic methodology and tools for quantifying uncertainty in risk \(or benefit\) assessments started with research projects \(\[R3\] was one product\) funded by the UK Food Standards Agency \(UK FSA\) and led to membership of the EFSA working group developing a new guidance document on the assessment of uncertainty to cover all areas of EFSA’s activity. The first EFSA output was a scientific opinion on the underlying science and principles \[R6\] which led, after a public consultation phase, to a new guidance document \(see part 4 of this case study\). The opinion and guidance document provide a coherent approach to uncertainty analysis focussed on the actual uncertainty of conclusions provided to EU risk managers and rooted fundamentally in the subjective Bayesian approach to uncertainty and statistical inference, including generalisation to imprecise probabilities. The opinion and guidance document also include a novel method for applying probability bounds analysis to imprecise probabilities describing both uncertainty and variability, intended to allow assessors to provide useful partial probability statements to risk managers based on extremely limited probability judgements obtained by expert knowledge elicitation. The key principle of the guidance is that the analysis should focus on the uncertainty in conclusions/recommendations provided to decision\-makers, i.e. uncertainty about reality rather than uncertainty about parameters in models. 

 In summary, Craig’s research has focussed on statistical tools for quantification of uncertainty in risk assessments with a particular emphasis on issues relevant to food safety.

 **\[R6\]** surveys the science required for uncertainty analysis, bringing it together in an approach containing several novel elements: emphasis on overall uncertainty of conclusions and recommendations, use of imprecise probability theory as a key mathematical and practical tool, probability bounds analysis for simple analysis of uncertainty about outputs of models combining variable quantities. In a testimonial for REF 2021, Professor Hardy \(Chair of EFSA Scientific Committee at the time of developing **\[R6\]** and the guidance on uncertainty\) confirmed that Craig was the primary provider of input on mathematical and statistical methodology and the principles behind use of probability and imprecise probability to quantify expert judgement, the lead drafting author for quantitative sections of **\[R6\]** including appendices, and the sole drafting author for Appendix B.13 Probability Bounds Analysis.*

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Craig’s work should be seen in the context of the critical role played by the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\), the European Union \(EU\) agency established in 2001 by the European Parliament and Council to develop and manage risk assessment policy in the EU regarding food and animal feed safety. EFSA’s scientific advice helps to protect consumers, animals and the environment from food\-related risks. EFSA publications are used as the basis for policy making and implementation by the European Commission and Parliament and by individual EU member states. By contributing to a step\-change in the way that EFSA addresses uncertainty, Craig’s research is crucial to decisions that have serious consequences for the health of people, animals and the environment. 

 In food safety risk assessment, scientists must assess the safety of a new food, pesticide or food\-borne bacteria. As evidence or knowledge is always incomplete, it is important to explain how uncertainty may affect conclusions and the implications for decision\-making. In quantifying these uncertainties, Craig’s methodology and tools have significantly improved EFSA’s assessments of risk and benefit in relation to food production, packaging and consumption. 

####  Impact in the area of pesticide registration 

 One EFSA role is overall supervision of EU risk assessment for pesticides. In that role, EFSA produces and publishes risk assessment peer reviews of individual pesticides which support decisions made by individual EU member states in response to applications from the pesticide industry for authorisation for use. Risk assessment for pesticides covers the risk to humans from eating food containing pesticides, the risk to humans from exposure via the skin \(for example when spraying pesticides or working with plants which have been sprayed\) and the risk to other species exposed due to the use of pesticides in agricultural production. 

 In the period for consideration of impact for REF 2021, the ecotoxicology sections of EFSA peer review reports for 5 pesticides used the geometric mean approach proposed and justified in \[R4\]. For example, \[E1\] refined the acute risk assessment for fish species in this way for the pesticide acrinathrin. The benefit of the geometric mean approach was that applicants for authorisation were encouraged to provide test results for more species than required by legislation. Previously the test result for the most sensitive species would be used and this was effectively a disincentive to test additional species. The benefit for applicants of the changed approach was knowledge that the geometric mean would be used, thereby making authorisation more likely, while the reliability of the assessment benefited from the greater knowledge provided by additional test results 

 The EFSA 2018 \[E5\] guidance document on dermal absorption \(for pesticides\) made two changes to guidance on the basis of research reported in Appendix B: \(i\) to the calculation to allow for uncertainty about absorption on the basis of limited in vitro data; \(ii\) to the default values to be used in the absence of in vitro data for the pesticide to address the uncertainty arising from the absence of the data. The first of these changes means that uncertainty due to limited sample size is now taken properly into account in the assessment and the second means that the new default values are based on a transparent analysis of a large dataset taking into account uncertainty about absorption for an untested pesticide. In May 2018, the EU Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed recommended \[E6\] that the guidance be used, from August 2018, by applicants for authorisation and by EU members states in peer reviews of pesticides. The result is improved treatment of uncertainty and greater transparency about the basis for decisions. 

####  Uncertainty across EFSA 

 Guidance document \[E2\] provides explicit direction on how to carry out uncertainty analysis in scientific assessments. The guidance was adopted by the EFSA Scientific Committee in December 2017 \[E3a\] and is applicable to all areas of EFSA’s work \[E3b\]. The most significant new feature of this guidance is the requirement that assessors should assess the overall impact of uncertainty on conclusions and that they should express the uncertainty using the mathematical language of probability. This new approach is fundamentally rooted in the subjectivist view of probability and associated methodology, areas of Craig’s research expertise. During development of the guidance, Craig was one of two lead drafting authors and had responsibility for the quantitative sections \[E3b\]. 

 Following the adoption of the guidance, EFSA created a standing cross\-cutting Working Group \(WG\) on Uncertainty \[E4\] and Craig has been a member since its inception. As well as experts in uncertainty, the cross\-cutting WG has members from four of EFSA’s eight Scientific Panels and is mandated to support the Panels in applying the guidance in their outputs.  Examples of EFSA outputs following the new guidance and containing substantial uncertainty analysis are: 

-  the scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens on dietary reference values for sodium \[E7\], produced at the request of the European Commission. Sodium is an important element in human diet but also a source of health risk, and both risk and benefit are uncertain. The scientific opinion provides a transparent account and quantification of uncertainties affecting the conclusions as required by \[E2\]. 

-  the EFSA Panel on Plant Health Guidance on quantitative pest risk assessment \[E9\] which is used routinely by the Panel in subsequent assessments of risk of entry, spread and consequent environmental and economic damage for plant and plant\-based pests. 

-  The scientific opinion of the EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards on control options for Campylobacter in broilers at primary production \[E10\], produced at the request of the European Commission. Campylobacter is a significant contributor to food\-poisoning resulting from consumption of contaminated poultry. 

-  EFSA Scientific Reports on cumulative risk from presence of multiple pesticides in human diet, produced by EFSA in the context of the EU regulations requiring that \(a\) decisions about the maximum levels permitted in food should take into account cumulative effects as and when methods for doing so become available and \(b\) pesticides should have no harmful effects – including cumulative effects – on humans. The first such report is \[E8\]. Previously, risk to consumers from the presence of pesticide residues in food was only assessed substance by substance despite the possibility of multiple substances contributing cumulatively to a particular harmful effect. 

 Uncertainty assessment requires expert training both for assessors and for decision\-makers who use assessments. To support implementation of the uncertainty guidance, EFSA commissioned a series of training courses \(for example \[E11\]\). Craig was one of two tutors who prepared and delivered the training for four courses on general application of the guidance, delivered to EFSA scientific staff and external members of the ten scientific panels, and three courses each tailored to the needs of a single scientific panel and attended by all panel members and staff from related EFSA units. Each 1.5\-2 day course was attended by 25\-30 scientists full\-time. Craig was a facilitator at a two\-day 2017 EFSA workshop reviewing 13 case studies covering a wide range of EFSA activities and conducted during a one\-year trial period for the draft guidance. Participants were relevant risk managers \(decision\-makers\) from the European Commission and the scientific experts who worked on each case study. 

 Further impacts derive from the influence of EFSA outputs on other international groups involved in food safety, e.g. the US Environmental Protection Agency, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \(OECD\), the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \(FAO\)/World Health Organization \(WHO\) Meeting on Pesticide Residues, and the WHO. During the period for consideration of impact for REF 2021 and following from his work with EFSA: \(i\) Craig joined an OECD working group on international harmonisation in relation to dermal absorption of chemicals; \(ii\) Craig delivered training on uncertainty to the EU Joint Research Centre, the EU Scientific Committee on Health Environment and Emerging Risks, the UK Food Standards Agency and Finland’s food safety agency EVIRA.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The autoimmune disease Guillain–Barré syndrome \(GBS\) is the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide yet treatment options are limited. UofG research on the immunopathology of GBS has stimulated commercial investment by global pharmaceutical companies for preclinical and early phase clinical trials to develop and/or repurpose complement inhibitors and other drugs as targeted therapies; for example, eculizumab \(Alexion Pharmaceuticals\), ANX005 \(Annexon Biosciences\), and ARGX\-117 \(argenx\). In addition, UofG work with the International GBS Outcome Study \(IGOS\) Consortium has supported a phase 2 trial of imlifidase \(Hansa Biopharma\) as a novel treatment for GBS. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 With a research portfolio spanning over 30 years, UofG neurologist **Prof Hugh Willison** is one of the foremost international experts on the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune neuropathies, particularly GBS. 

 **Creation of mouse model identifies complement factors in immunopathogenesis of GBS** 

 GBS is a rare disease that develops as an immune response to a prior infection—typically gastroenteritis caused by *Campylobacter jejuni*—which generates anti\-ganglioside autoantibodies that cross\-react with components of the peripheral nervous system, leading to paralysis. Although GBS has been under investigation since it was first described in 1916, current treatment options remain limited. Lack of a suitable mouse model for GBS posed a major hurdle to advances in both understanding the immunopathology of this disease and assessment of candidate therapeutic agents. UofG research has been instrumental in addressing this gap. 

 In 2005, UofG researchers reported the use of anti\-ganglioside autoantibodies to develop the first definitive human\-equivalent mouse model of GBS \( **Mr John Goodfellow**, **Dr Susan Halstead**, **Willison**\) \[3.1\]. This model subsequently demonstrated that the complement system is critical for driving development of GBS \( **Dr Rhona McGonigal**, **Halstead**, **Willison**\) \[3.2\]. The complement system is a key component of the immune response; it comprises a large number of circulating factors, which become activated via a proteolytic cascade in response to immune challenge. The UofG team found that treatment of *ex vivo* muscle preparations with an inhibitor of complement factor C5 \(eculizumab; Alexion Pharmaceuticals, New Haven, USA\) provided neuroprotection from antibody\-mediated injury \[3.2\]. Together, these findings indicated that blocking components of the complement system might offer a novel treatment option for patients with GBS. 

 **Preclinical and early phase clinical trials of complement inhibitors as treatment for GBS** 

 *Eculizumab* 

 Eculizumab \(marketed as Soliris\) is a humanised monoclonal antibody licensed for use in autoimmune conditions such as atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome. To determine the efficacy of this drug as a potential treatment for GBS, UofG researchers conducted a preclinical study that showed eculizumab completely protected the GBS mouse model from developing neurological symptoms \(2008; **Halstead**, **Willison**\) \[3.3\]. During 2009–2010, **Willison** conducted the first clinical study of a complement inhibitor for autoimmune neuropathy, a safety study of eculizumab administered concurrently with intravenous immunoglobulin, among 13 patients with multifocal motor neuropathy \[3.4\]. This study was funded by Alexion and confirmed that the combination therapy was safe. In addition, the trial revealed a small treatment effect of eculizumab that was independent of the co\-administered immunoglobulin \[3.4\]. **Halstead**, **Goodfellow** and **Willison** subsequently undertook the first clinical trial of eculizumab for GBS in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin \(ICA\-GBS;  [NCT02029378](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02029378)\). With funding from Alexion, this phase 2 randomised double\-blind placebo\-controlled trial enrolled eight GBS patients and was conducted during 2014–2016 \[3.5\]. The findings demonstrated that eculizumab could be used safely for this novel indication. 

 *ANX005* 

 UofG expertise in complement inhibition as a potential targeted therapy for GBS led to a collaboration with Annexon Biosciences \(San Francisco, USA\). In 2013, **McGonigal** and **Willison** tested this company’s complement factor C1q inhibitor \(ANX005; also known as M1\) in an updated transgenic version of the UofG mouse model of GBS \[3.6\]. This research showed that ANX005 attenuated injury and conferred a neuroprotective effect, positioning C1q as an additional target in the complement system for treating GBS patients.

 **Research funding** 

 **Willison’s** research on GBS has been continuously funded by the Wellcome Trust for the past 25 years, most recently through an Investigator Award of GBP2,000,000 \(2016–2021\). 
","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Context** 

 GBS has an annual incidence of 1.1–1.8 cases per 100,000 people \(equivalent to 600–1,000 cases in the UK each year\). Although rare, this condition is associated with high healthcare costs, as approximately 20% of patients experience persistent and substantial morbidity that limits their mobility and quality of life, with an additional 15% reporting residual pain and tiredness. GBS is also the most frequent cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide; however, therapeutic options for affected individuals are limited. 

 **Willison’s** pioneering research on GBS has been widely recognised by his peers; for example, in 2015, he was awarded the Alan J Gebhart Prize by the Peripheral Nerve Society, the highest honour that this organisation can bestow \[5.A\]. Expertise in the immunopathogenesis of GBS has enabled Willison and his team to make major contributions to the field, including advances in targeted treatment options that provide commercial benefits for the pharmaceutical industry. 

 **Development of targeted therapies for GBS** 

 Rare disease is a difficult area of investment for pharmaceutical companies, with research and development of new treatments facing issues such as high level of complexity within disease groups; difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of patients for clinical trials; and low financial return. The UofG mouse model of GBS \[3.1\], which mimics human disease by recapitulating the relevant immunological pathways, has been pivotal in driving the development of targeted therapies for this rare condition. 

 *Eculizumab* 

 Alexion specialises in exploiting complement biology for the discovery, development and commercialisation of therapies for rare diseases. **Willison** first engaged with this company in 2003, when it agreed to supply eculizumab for his preclinical work in the UofG mouse model of GBS \[5.A\]. The positive response reported by the UofG team \[3.2, 3.3\] convinced Alexion to invest in further investigation of eculizumab as a treatment for GBS, with UofG researchers demonstrating a clinical benefit among patients with autoimmune neuropathy in two early phase clinical trials \[3.4, 3.5\]. This work led to a joint patent between UofG and Alexion \( **Willison** and **Halstead** listed as co\-inventors\), describing the methods and compositions for treatment with eculizumab repurposed for GBS \[5.B\]. The patent was granted novelty in Japan and Korea \(2015\), as well as in the USA and Europe \(2016\). 

 Demyelinating GBS is the predominant subtype detected in Europe and North America; by contrast, 30%–65% of GBS patients in East Asia, Central America and South America are diagnosed with the axonal subtype. Given this regional difference, a phase 2b randomised double\-blind placebo\-controlled trial was conducted in Japan during 2015–2016 \(JET\-GBS;  [NCT02493725](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02493725)\) to inform Alexion’s global development plans for eculizumab as a treatment for GBS \[5.C\]. The design of JET\-GBS was influenced by the ICA\-GBS trial protocol \[3.5, 5.A\]. JET\-GBS enrolled 35 patients who were unable to walk independently. An improvement in functional grade \(ability to run\) was recorded at 24 weeks post\-intervention among 74% of patients in the eculizumab group versus 18% in the placebo group. These findings encouraged Alexion to seek regulatory approval for eculizumab in Japan. On 19 June 2020, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency \(PMDA\) granted SAKIGAKE designation for eculizumab in GBS \[5.C\]. SAKIGAKE is analogous to the European Medicines Agency PRIME programme and the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) Breakthrough Therapy designation. It provides enhanced support for companies developing innovative treatments for diseases with unmet clinical need, and confers several advantages, including prioritised consultation and expedited review. This was the first SAKIGAKE designation received by Alexion; consequently, the company focused its GBS development pipeline for eculizumab on the Japanese market, with plans to initiate a phase 3 study in 2021, pending regulatory feedback from the PMDA \[5.C\]. 

 In December 2020, Alexion announced that it had been acquired by AstraZeneca. According to the press release \[5.C\], this deal benefits AstraZeneca through “ *Greater scientific presence in immunology by adding Alexion's innovative complement\-technology platforms and strong pipeline … the company will further globalise Alexion’s portfolio*”. In addition, AstraZeneca will establish a dedicated rare disease unit, to be headquartered in Boston. 

 *ANX005* 

 Annexon develops disease\-modifying therapies for patients with autoimmune diseases that involve the complement pathway. Given his expertise regarding the role of complement in GBS, Annexon reached out to **Willison** in 2012 and invited him to sit on the Scientific Advisory Board \[5.D\]. In this role, Willison has provided insight regarding the classical complement pathway in GBS; enabled preclinical research on Annexon’s anti\-C1q antibody ANX005 using the UofG GBS mouse model \[3.6\]; advised on the design of proof\-of\-concept clinical trials for ANX005; and brokered introductions between Annexon and physicians around the world who have contributed to both preclinical and clinical studies by providing samples from patients with GBS \[5.D\]. Annexon’s Chief Scientific Officer highlighted that the preclinical findings \[3.6\] have *“proven to be critical for obtaining both financial investor and clinical investigator interest in our clinical studies. As a result, we have initiated GBS clinical studies in Bangladesh, have obtained Fast Track and Orphan Drug Status designations for our studies in GBS by the US FDA and will begin early phase clinical studies in the EU and USA”* \[5.D\]. This approach to GBS treatment led to a joint UofG–Annexon patent, with **Willison** and **McGonigal** listed as co\-inventors \(2016\) \[5.B\]. 

 Annexon conducted the first clinical trial of ANX005 for GBS at the National Institute of Neurosciences and Hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, primarily on the advice of **Willison** owing to the increased incidence of GBS in this country \(3.25 cases per 100,000 people\). He was also able to broker introductions to key staff; for example, at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh \(icddr,b\) \[5.E\]. This phase 1b placebo\-controlled dose\-escalation trial was conducted during 2017–2019. It was the first clinical trial of a novel interventional drug of this nature to take place in Bangladesh, providing a valuable developmental opportunity such as the employment of more than 40 study personnel \(physicians, laboratory staff, support staff\) \[5.E\]. The preliminary data were released by Annexon in September 2019 \[5.E\]. ANX005 was well\-tolerated at all dose levels among 31 patients with GBS, and no drug\-related serious adverse events or discontinuations were recorded. Patients treated with ANX005 had reduced levels of a biomarker for nerve damage in neurodegenerative disease and exhibited positive trends across key GBS outcome measures such as muscle strength. These findings were sufficiently promising to warrant additional clinical trials for this indication. 

 In September 2019, ANX005 received FDA Fast Track designation for the treatment of GBS \[5.E\]. This designation expedites the development, review and approval of investigational product candidates that are intended to treat serious conditions with unmet medical need. A phase 1b multicentre study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and drug–drug interactions of ANX005 and intravenous immunoglobulin \( [NCT04035135](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04035135)\) started recruitment in February 2020. Recruiting centres are located in Bangladesh, Denmark, the Netherlands, the UK \(UofG Biomedical Research Centre\) and the USA. Study completion is expected by September 2021. In addition, patient dosing has started in a phase 2/3 clinical study of ANX\-005. On announcing this development in December 2020, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Annexon stated: “ *We are pleased to advance our GBS program into later\-stage clinical development, bringing us closer to potentially delivering a much\-needed treatment option to patients combatting this debilitating disease. The advancement of ANX005 also continues to inform our ongoing clinical development across a host of additional complement\-mediated autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases*” \[5.E\]. 

 *Imlifidase* 

 The International GBS Outcome Study \(IGOS\) Consortium aims to identify clinical and biological determinants and predictors of disease course in a large international cohort \(>1,500 patients\). **Willison** is a member of the IGOS Consortium  [Steering Committee](https://gbsstudies.erasmusmc.nl/participants); he also runs the UK arm of this programme, and chairs the Biomarkers Subgroup. UofG involvement is instrumental for the development of GBS clinical trial platforms, where it provides a means for recruitment and assessment of cases. One example of IGOS\-supported research is a phase 2 study of imlifidase conducted by Hansa Biopharma \(Lund, Sweden\). This potential intervention for GBS is a bacterial immunoglobulin G\-degrading enzyme derived from *Streptococcus pyogenes*. The clinical trial \( [NCT03943589](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03943589)\) will assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of imlifidase among 30 patients with GBS. Recruitment began in June 2019, with study completion expected by December 2022. Recruiting centres are based in France, the Netherlands and the UK \(Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow; **Goodfellow**\). 

 *Supporting preclinical drug development* 

 In August 2019, **Willison** signed research agreements with argenx \(Breda, the Netherlands\) and Polyneuron Pharmaceuticals \(Basel, Switzerland\) to conduct preclinical work using the UofG mouse model of GBS \[3.1\]. Argenx takes a strategic academic–industry collaborative approach to developing antibody\-based therapies for autoimmune diseases. Willison is supporting development of the argenx complement factor c2 inhibitor \(ARGX\-117\) \[5.F\], which has already entered a phase 1 trial to test route of administration among healthy volunteers \(data expected by mid\-2021\) \[5.F\]. Polyneuron Pharmaceuticals is a biotechnology start\-up company focussing on rare autoimmune diseases of the nervous system with unmet clinical need. Willison is investigating a molecule \(PN\-1018\) developed by this company to target a novel therapeutic pathway in GBS \[5.F\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Davis’ research has resulted in comprehensive pension reforms in 5 Caribbean countries \(Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname\) and thus increased retirement income security for vulnerable people in old age. The research has improved pension fund regulators’ ability to calculate risks and take appropriate action when detecting difficulties in individual funds or the entire sector. Accordingly, these reforms have increased the scope for prospective retirees to be financially independent and cared for in old age, not least given favourable related developments such as rises in pension fund assets in Jamaica \(which has seen a 6% increase of pension fund assets\) and in the registration of funds with the supervisory authorities in Barbados \(which now has 96% fully registered pension plans\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Davis is an expert on pension funds and the economic impact of population ageing. He has published extensively on pension regulation, pension fund finance, and retirement income provision in the last 20 years \(Ref. 2; Ref. 3; Ref. 7\) and presented on the topic in the UK and the Caribbean \(Ref. 1; Ref. 4; Ref. 5\). 

 Pension funds are key financial institutions in many countries, which contribute to the economy and enable individuals to save sufficiently for retirement. However, pension provision is in crisis globally, which jeopardises financial sustainability, care and dignity in old age \(Ref. 7\). Failure of pension funds can lead to major losses for both current and prospective retirees and widespread poverty in old age. It can also disrupt the financial market, affect the reputation of the country concerned, and reduce the financial and economic development of that country. 

 Prof. Davis’ research found that the ongoing shift from defined benefits \(DB\) pension schemes \(which guarantee a retirement income\) to defined contribution \(DC\) pension schemes \(where the retirement income depends on market returns\), is a key aspect of the crisis \(Ref. 3\). Other contributors are turbulence in financial markets and variable accounting standards. Most of these are risks which are generally beyond the scope of regulation. 

 In 2015, the Association of British Insurers commissioned Prof. Davis to challenge a pension reform proposed by the UK Government \(Ref. 4\). Prof. Davis found that the proposal, which raised the possibility to move from the EET system \(where pension savings and returns are exempt from income tax, but pension income is taxed\) to a TEE system \(where pension savings would be from taxed income but with no taxation thereafter\), would actually be detrimental to the UK financial market. The suggested change would lead to a reduction in personal savings, adverse effects on the macroeconomy and a long\-term fiscal imbalance. 

 In 2017, the IMF commissioned Prof. Davis to conduct research on macroprudential indicators \(which show authorities system\-wide risk\) and the development of financial soundness indicators for 36 countries \(Ref. 6\). Prof. Davis’ research showed that it is possible to use Concentration and Distribution Measures \(CDMs\) \(which can capture financial risks within the banking sector\) to predict system\-wide vulnerabilities, with appropriate control variables. These can also be used in the pension sector: by generating health and stability indicators for individual pension funds, authorities can calculate CDMs and detect risks. 

 A key aspect of Prof. Davis’ research on pension funds has focused on pension regulation and international investment of pension funds in the Caribbean. From 2015 to 2017, the IMF’s Caribbean Technical Assistance Centre \(CARTAC\) commissioned Prof. Davis to research and advise on the calculation of financial health and stability indicators for pension policy in 5 Caribbean countries: Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname. 

 The Caribbean is not exempt from the global issues for pensions and faces regulatory challenges regarding pension management. Only a low percentage of the population participates in pension funds and especially some of the most vulnerable people \(those who are self\-employed, unemployed or emigrants\) often do not have a pension scheme. This, a lack of personnel satisfactorily trained in finance, and insufficient consumer and regulator knowledge, weakens the pension systems in the Caribbean. 

 Prof. Davis demonstrated that pension fund authorities in the Caribbean could undertake the creation of health and stability indicators for individual pension funds \(Ref. 5\), using in that context aspects of the work he had undertaken for the IMF \(Ref. 6\). In the presentations given in the Caribbean, he showed a set of indicators, which enable regulators to assess the vulnerability of pension funds to standard financial risks \(Ref. 2; Ref. 3; Ref. 4; Ref. 5; Ref. 7\). He highlighted that these indicators provide a benchmark to supervisors for intervention in case pension funds—or the entire pension sector—are facing difficulties. They can consequently enable supervisors to reflect on the overall health of the sector and intervene appropriately. Prof. Davis further used his research on pension taxation in the UK to illustrate the political risks to which pension funds can be subject.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prof. Davis’ research on pension fund management and regulation has led to crucial policy changes at CARTAC and the 5 Caribbean countries concerned which CARTAC advises, and thereby protected retirement income security for vulnerable people in old age. 

 On the basis of Prof. Davis’ research, CARTAC recommended reforms of pension fund regulation in the Bahamas, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname to improve both operational issues \(such as improvement of data collection from pension funds\) and strategic level approaches \(such as the implementation and analysis of health and stability indicators that highlight pension fund risks\). The reform included a new statistical reporting template that increased the level of information among supervisors; the introduction of a suite of health and stability indicators \(which highlight the risks to which pension funds are subject\); and development of reporting and regulatory approaches. 

 CARTAC confirms that the Caribbean nations fully accepted the recommendations and adopted the framework for improved pension regulation, as proposed by Prof. Davis. \[REDACTED\] 

 \[REDACTED\] This has a fundamental human welfare factor given the fact that pension assets in these countries account for a significant proportion of the GDP and cover a sizeable proportion of the workforce. For example, the Jamaican pension fund has 115,000 members \(10% of the employed labour force\) with assets equivalent to 26% of GDP. In Barbados, there are 30,000 members of registered plans \(20% of the workforce\) and assets equivalent to around 42% of GDP. 

 The Financial Services Commission Barbados \[REDACTED\] the Commission was able to increase the number of pension plans registered under the country’s Occupational Pension Benefits Act \(OPBA\) and went from 145 pension plans in 2014 to 268 in 2017 \(Source 3\). This means there are now 96% fully registered active pension plans in Barbados whose risks can thus be supervised appropriately. 

 The Central Bank of the Bahamas \[REDACTED\] Annual Report & Statement of Accounts 2016 confirms that the Pension Division revamped their statistics survey and improved staff training regarding the development and maintenance of key financial health and stability indicators for the pension sector \(\[REDACTED\], Source 5\). The Bank can now flag up risks within the pension sector more strategically and has greatly improved their surveillance over the pension fund sector in the Bahamas. 

 The Bank of Guyana also changed their pension fund\-reporting template, which gave way to more effective monitoring of financial trends. \[REDACTED\] In 2018, a year after the CARTAC mission, the private pension sector in Guyana “continued to experience consistent growth…with a relatively low…impact to systemic risk” \(Source 7\). \[REDACTED\] 

 The Bank of Jamaica Financial Stability Report 2017 indicates the sectoral development in Pensions since the CARTAC mission: while in 2012, pension fund assets made up 22.4% of the GDP, in 2017 that number stood at 28.2% \(Source 8\). 

 The Central Bank of Suriname also adopted the new pension reporting forms and indicators and deployed “the expanded list of indicators in their supervisory and risk management frameworks” \(Source 9\). Prof. Davis led these changes in regulation and supervisors were able to gain additional knowledge in several key areas of pension, such as challenges facing the pension sector in the region and risks in pension funds \(\[REDACTED\], Source 9\). This has enabled them to take regulatory action when detecting potential difficulties in individual funds or the sector as a whole. 

 Prof. Davis’ research serves as an outstanding example of how effective pension reforms can have a fundamental impact on regulators and thus benefit at\-risk people in several countries. His contribution has \[REDACTED\] benefited some of the most vulnerable people in the Caribbean. The changes in pension data management and supervision have improved retirement income security for both current and prospective pension plan members and thus safeguarded their wellbeing in old age.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 LSE research on “Migrant Margins” provides a uniquely comparative account of street economies in urban peripheries across UK cities with historically high migration flows. Its principal impacts are threefold: \(1\) challenging official planning discourse via the provision of new socio\-economic analysis of high streets and new evidence of their value; \(2\) supporting the work of grassroots organisations lobbying against specific redevelopment challenges in London, including advocating against the loss of low\-cost retail workspace and the displacement of ethnic minorities in regeneration processes; and \(3\) developing new public learning resources to challenge narrow debates on migration. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A body of work on the “Migrant Margins”, led by Dr Suzanne Hall at LSE, introduces new perspectives on the socio\-economic value of high street economies in urban peripheries shaped by global migration and urban marginalisation. It draws on face\-to\-face surveys with more than 500 shop proprietors on high streets across Birmingham, Bristol, Leicester, London, and Manchester; conversations with local authorities; and engagements with activist groups. The underpinning research comprises four distinct but connected projects, sustaining a substantial body of research relevant to planning policy, activism, and teaching and learning. The core research took place between 2012 and 2018 and incorporates insights into how the global financial crisis, the austerity governance that followed, and the ideological crisis of migration shape street economies. 

 **Ordinary Streets \(2012\-2014\)** examined Rye Lane in South London. It developed a face\-to\-face survey methodology generating detailed accounts and evidence of the crucial social and economic role of high streets in contexts of precarity. It revealed emerging employment patterns within the growing field of self\-employed shop retail; identified new tenure arrangements and spatial subdivisions in relation to rising property values; and explored the role of trade associations in negotiating everyday contestations. Alongside well\-cited academic outputs \(e.g. **\[1\]**\), the research generated public outputs such as podcasts and videos for wider audiences including Key Stage 3, 4, and 5 learners **\[2\] \[3\]**. 

 **Super\-diverse Streets \(2015\-2017\)** explored the street economies of independent shop proprietors across de\-industrial peripheries in Birmingham, Bristol, Leicester, and Manchester. The research built on the Ordinary Streets methodology to produce additional insights into how histories of migration shape street livelihoods, identifying forms of socio\-economic participation that challenge integrationist policy debates. It captured the multi\-lingual proficiencies, occupational skills and educational levels of shop proprietors and trans\-national circuits of trade. The work builds on the “diverse economies” approach in relation to precarious urban peripheries, highlighting form\-filling economies that respond to everyday bordering fostered by the UK Immigration Acts, and economies of care established in response to austerity **\[4\]**. 

 In its second phase, Super\-diverse Streets analysed the organisational models and support needs of trade associations in Birmingham and Leicester. This was carried out in collaboration with  [Social Life](http://www.social-life.co/), a social enterprise created by the Young Foundation in 2012 to become a specialist centre of research and innovation about the social life of communities. The research team explored how different organisational models, differentially deployed by traders, affect communication with local authorities and convene differing interests amongst street proprietors. Key findings point to effective ways of supporting traders to strengthen their informal networks and existing social media platforms; and brokering new forms of partnership between local authorities and local trading groups, avoiding the “one\-size\-fits\-all” approach of Business Improvement Districts. 

 **High Streets for All \(2017\)** was commissioned by the Greater London Authority \(GLA\) and carried out in collaboration with architectural firm We Made That and with Just Space, a  large network of around 80 community groups, campaigners, and action groups formed in 2007 to provide a voice for Londoners at grassroots level during the formulation of London’s major planning strategy. In 2015, Just Space and its member groups began to prepare contributions for a completely new London Plan commissioned by the Mayor. The LSE researchers particularly contributed expertise in visual mapping, user experience, and measures of social value. The project’s key output, widely circulated as a publicly available report **\[5\]**, clarified the social and economic values of streets in London undergoing pronounced change. 

 **Socio\-economic Value at the Elephant and Castle \(2018\)** provided an evidence base for the role of micro\-economies and ethnic minority trade to contest the displacement associated with regeneration at Elephant and Castle \(E&C\). Commissioned by the charity Latin Elephant, its final report **\[6\]** highlights the importance of protecting affordable workspace across London and provided additional evidence supporting Latin Elephant’s advocacy for the protection of the 130 independent, largely BAME traders operating at E&C. 

 Together, the Migrant Margins body of research has generated significant new evidence for the socio\-economic value of urban high streets and evidenced the role of migration in sustaining street economies in de\-industrial UK cities. The research continues, and has now extended beyond the UK to migrant street livelihoods in Cape Town, South Africa.

 **Evidence of research quality**: This Migrant Margins work produced seven peer\-reviewed journal articles including **\[1\]** and **\[4\]**, the latter of which was shortlisted for the *Urban Studies Best Article Award*. Hall received an ESRC Future Research Leaders award to support Super\-diverse Streets. She was the 2017 recipient of the Philip Leverhulme Prize in Sociology, allowing her to extend her research to Cape Town. The research supported her participation as Co\-I on a 2018\-2020 AHRC\-funded project on the urban economies of Brick Lane \(GBP565,583\) and a 2017\-2019 IGA\-Rockefeller grant on cities of refuge \(GBP160,044\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Migrant Margins research challenges official discourse on the urban margins and migration by providing detailed and comparative accounts of street livelihoods in relation to social change. Its translation to reports \(e.g. **\[5\]** and **\[6\]**\) and film and audio outputs \(e.g. **\[2\]** and **\[3\]**\) has engaged a wide non\-academic audience with these important issues. The inclusion of intended users as partners in the research was also central to assuring its wider relevance. This has included commissioned work for state planning authorities **\[5\]**, and activist collaboration in research **\[6\]**. Key impacts include: 

-  At metropolitan level: inputs to planning policy and practice, and the use of new research evidence by activists and community planning groups. Impacts described in this case study relate particularly to London, but are starting to be felt elsewhere, too. 

-  At national and international level: catalysing and helping to shape public debate and providing new teaching and learning resources. 

 **Informing policy and planning in London** 

 **Changing understanding of the value of micro\-economies:** Many UK cities \- including London \- are trapped in models of economic development which prioritise GDP growth over broader social and economic well\-being. By demonstrating the socio\-economic value of overlooked street economies, the research has challenged conventional perspectives that tend to ignore the role of micro\-scale independent retail and the class and cultural intermixtures this supports. In so doing, it has contributed to a shift in planning vocabulary, providing planning authorities in London with an alternative framework for understanding the socio\-economic value of micro\-economies. This framework shifts emphasis from high\-value, high\-rent retail floorspace and its performance as investment property, towards understanding of the breadth of values of high streets. These issues are analysed in depth in the 2017  [<ins>""High Streets for All""</ins>](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/high_streets_for_all_report_web_final.pdf) report **\[5\]**, and have important implications for policy and planning. This is acknowledged by the GLA Regeneration Manager, who states that **\[5\]** “ *shaped the GLA’s approach to high streets”* generally, as well as contributing to specific policy formation and investment decisions. That contribution is reflected in key strategies and planning outcomes: 

 “This report **\(\[5\]**\) has influenced the  [London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf) policy \[the statutory spatial development strategy for Greater London\] and the GLA’s investment programmes such as the  [Good Growth Fund](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/regeneration/funding-opportunities/good-growth-fund-supporting-regeneration-london) \[which directs Mayor resources to support local economies such as high streets\], which in turn have helped deliver significant outcomes across London.” **\[A\]**. 

 The GLA further acknowledged the influence of insights from Ordinary Streets **\[1\]** and Super\-diverse Streets **\[4\]**, which have: 

 “…helped sharpen the focus of our work towards identifying, protecting, and enhancing the social value of high streets. With your support we have developed our understanding of high streets as diverse and flexible places, able to adapt and change over time. We now also fully understand that they are also places where people live, socialise, work, access services, and for recent immigrants and other marginalised groups are often the locations best disposed to start and grow a business or enterprise *.”  \[A\]** 

 In combination with pressure from local and London\-wide community organisations, this changed understanding has begun to deliver effects on the formulation of policy. The publication of **\[5\]** helped to ensure that Hall’s work *“penetrated official thinking”*, as explained by Just Space **\[B\]**. As a result: 

 *“…we are beginning to see substantial change in the latest draft London Plan where the City Hall planners have accepted a lot of changes of wording and emphasis… \[Hall’s\]* *work has been referred to and relied upon by many of the organisations making representations at the Examination in Public.”* **\[B\]** 

 **Providing new evidence for the role of micro\-economies and low\-cost workspace**: The research has been used by advocacy organisations to recognise the role of urban micro\-economies and the need for affordable workspace in planning processes associated with regeneration. In September 2015, Just Space published  [<ins>""London for All""</ins>](https://justspacelondon.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/workspacehandbook_lowres.pdf), a handbook for community and small business groups fighting threats posed to workspaces by rising costs and displacement. The handbook shows how low\-cost workspace mitigates the impact of inequality “ *by providing opportunities for decent local jobs close to home for people on low\-incomes, part\-time workers, and those with caring responsibility”*. The Ordinary Streets research **\[1\]** provided core evidence for one of the 10 case studies used here **\[C**, p. 30 **\]**. 

 In London, the coupling of rising property values with extensive regeneration has seen hundreds of thousands of people squeezed out of affordable living and workspaces each year since 2008. The Migrant Margins research revealed distinctive impacts on affordable workspace and on ethnic minority groups. Hall and her colleagues have collaborated with groups including Latin Elephant \(which promotes alternative and innovative ways of engaging and incorporating migrant and ethnic groups in urban regeneration processes in London\) and Just Space to provide new evidence to challenge discourses on town centre regeneration. A Just Space representative explains: 

 *“The importance of Dr Hall’s work is that the old, narrow perspective on town centres is rapidly being exposed as partial and damaging. Her anthropological approach has been able to offer critiques of public policy and new evidence in a way which meets the crude official requirements for policy to be ‘evidence\-based’ and we are thus beginning to see shifts in policy of great importance.”* **\[B\]** 

 By providing socio\-economic evidence and offering new critiques of established discourses, work including **\[5\]** has “ *changed the official discourse in the field”*, an achievement described as “ *a huge undertaking”* **\[B\]**. 

 **Fighting the displacement of ethnic and minority traders and businesses**: The research has also been used by activists working to protect ethnic minority groups affected by regeneration\-related displacement. Alongside its academic outputs, Super\-diverse Streets produced an open\-access report,  [<ins>""Supporting ethnic minority traders and business in local high streets and centres""</ins>](http://www.social-life.co/media/files/Social_Life_report_for_Super-diverse_streets_231116_final.pdf), developed in 2016 in partnership with Social Life **\[D\]**. The report provided evidence\-based recommendations for local councils to better recognise and support street\-based networks and initiatives. The LSE researchers and Social Life worked with traders from Narborough Road \(Leicester\) to strengthen their informal trade network and provide a forum for issues affecting traders **\[D**, pp. 9\-10 **\]**. 

 In 2018, the LSE team collaborated with researchers from Loughborough University and Latin Elephant. The resulting report **\[6\]** supplemented existing work by Latin Elephant on the role of ethnic minority traders at the Elephant and Castle and their call for the GLA to protect the approximately 130 independent and largely BAME traders within the proposed redevelopment. The report highlighted the wider need to protect affordable workspace in the context of regeneration processes in London. It was supplied as additional evidence supporting Latin Elephant’s “Objection to Planning Application, Elephant and Castle Town Centre and LCC Campus at the EC” in July 2018 \(ref: 16/AP/4458\). The application was analysed by the GLA and final approval was granted on 10 December 2018. The Latin Elephant Chair of Trustees explains how they used **\[6\]**: 

 *“We brought together a team of researchers in order to present and generate substantive data to support our claim. With this information we were able to: Argue for an extension of affordable work and trading spaces in the new development – from the current 5 years to 15 years. This gain was achieved at the final stage approval by the Greater London Authority \(GLA\)”.* **\[E\]** 

 In October 2020, Hall was invited to sit on the Mission Sounding Board for London’s High Streets. This is one of nine recovery missions approved by the GLA and London Councils to help build the city’s economy and society in the wake of Covid\-19. Her appointment in part reflects the contribution of her research to policy and planning in London. 

 **Challenging narrow debates on migration and borders**: Narrating complex migration processes through the lens of the high street is core to addressing questions of borders in the context of a hostile immigration environment. The research described here has shown how migration is constitutive to the formation of UK cities and evidenced the significance of culturally diverse street economies in urban peripheries. The LSE team has worked with educational public platforms to help them include research\-based learning resources, showing how migration is located in the everyday life of UK cities. 

 The research has generated evidence that challenges prevailing notions of migration as unusual or problematic; this has been used in both national secondary school and international tertiary\-level learning programmes. In 2017, the Ordinary Streets and Super\-diverse Streets research was selected for inclusion in the Royal Geographical Society’s \(RGS\) newly\-formed Educational Podcast Series, which “ *aims to bring new research, debates, approaches, and methods to how geography is taught and learnt in schools”*. The resulting podcast,  [<ins>""Diverse Places and the High Street""</ins>](https://www.rgs.org/schools/teaching-resources/diverse-places-and-the-high-street/), was released on 19 April 2017. Aimed at Key Stages 3, 4, and 5 teachers and students, it was accompanied by an online lesson plan and teaching and learning resources \(see **\[3\]**\). This was based directly on the LSE research and included a film of the  [<ins>Ordinary Streets</ins>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bKWr2IjylM) project. The film had previously been posted on YouTube \(14,698 views at 20 November 2020\) and has been screened nationally and internationally and incorporated into various teaching curricula. The RGS podcast has so far been listened to almost 1,000 times. 

 The RGS site has links to the  [Ordinary Streets](https://lsecities.net/objects/research-projects/ordinary-streets) and  [Super\-diverse Streets](https://lsecities.net/objects/research-projects/super-diverse-streets) websites, where all research reports and mappings are available. The mappings reveal how streets are historically composed by migration and how shop spaces respond to social and economic change. According to the Head of Research and Higher Education at RGS: *“The maps, promoted at A\-Level study day events since 2016 \(engaging around 600 students\)… are an original and distinct resource for A\-Level students that encourage pupils to connect how migration has changed high streets in diverse places \(a core requirement of the A\-Level specification\)”* **\[F\]**. Presentations based on the research have been delivered for sixth form students in London \(The Charter School, 2017; Harris Girls’ and Harris Boys’ Academies, and Harris Academies, 2015\) and the Learning from Kilburn experimental university \(2013\). 

 Further public engagement activity has included participation in “Six Impossible Ideas after Brexit”. This series of short films was curated by Migration Matters **\[2\]**, a non\-profit organisation founded in 2016 in response to media coverage of the “refugee crisis”. Its mission is to provide a public platform for more evidence\-based conversations about migration, prompted by bite\-sized video courses. Hall contributed to three short educational videos offered free to the public on social media and via email subscription. These have been viewed some 10,000 times on the LSE Facebook page and another 8,500 times on Migration Matters social media platforms. All three: “ *continue to be used in current Erasmus\+ Virtual Exchanges, which enable youth with refugee and non\-refugee backgrounds in Europe and the Southern Mediterranean to engage in meaningful intercultural experiences online”* **\[G\]**. 

 The LSE research generated new evidence of the socio\-economic value of urban high streets and the role of migration in sustaining street economies. Sharing this with planners, policy\-makers, community and activist groups, and the public has made a distinctive contribution to new and ongoing debates about policy and planning in UK cities, and helped to challenge and develop new discourses about the so\-called “migration crisis”.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2019, A\-level music was 26<sup>th</sup> in a ranking of subjects by numbers of entries in England; in Scotland, the equivalent examination \(Advanced Higher music\) was ranked 5<sup>th</sup> \- behind only Maths, English, Chemistry and Biology. So, what’s different in Scotland? 

 One thing that’s different is the Youth Music Initiative \(YMI\), established in 2003 in response to *What's Going On? \(WGO\)* \- a detailed study of youth music in Scotland undertaken by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. The YMI is a national funding and development programme for young people’s music in Scotland, managed by Creative Scotland. Since its inception, it has supported Scottish local authorities to provide universal initial music\-making experiences in schools and funded local and national music initiatives in the informal and nonformal sectors, allowing countless young people to make music who would not otherwise have done so. Over 18 years, successive Scottish Governments have invested £164.5m in the YMI, and it is distinctive, and possibly unique, internationally. 

 It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that music remains a popular subject in Scottish schools. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 *WGO* \(Scottish Arts Council, 2003\) offered new and substantially improved insights into young people’s music making in Scotland, based on original research. It was commissioned by the Scottish Arts Council, Youth Music UK and the Musicians’ Union and was coauthored by Broad \(researcher in the present submission\), Professor Celia Duffy and David Price OBE. Research was conducted between June 2002 and January 2003 and comprised a systematic investigation of young people’s music making in Scotland, taking in all genres of music and a wide range of contexts for playing \(excluding the school classroom\). 

 The report’s commissioners required an evidence base upon which to develop future Scottish policy on music provision for young people and the report made a series of recommendations based on both qualitative and quantitative data drawn from a wide range of stakeholders, including young people themselves. Data collection methods included a range of questionnaires targeted at different stakeholders \(n=543\), focus groups throughout Scotland \(n=40\), and 50 key informant interviews. In addition, over 230 youth music groups provided quantitative data on their activities. 

 The research identified inconsistencies of provision, particularly of access to music making experiences, and the social and cultural barriers that made it more difficult for some young people to take part in music. It identified a lack of coherence across the sector, a need to support the informal sector especially, and an analysis of funding data showed the dominance of Western Classical music in funding streams, and the lack of support faced by youth music organisations working in Traditional music and Rock, Pop and Dance music. The continuous training needs of music leaders were highlighted, and these conclusions were set in the context of a growing body of evidence about the value of participation in music. 

 Following publication of the report, and the launching of the YMI, the researchers continued to work in partnership with the Scottish Arts Council, for example, designing the formula for distributing money to Local Authorities. 

 Subsequent commissions from the Scottish Arts Council \(SAC\) included research and production of the National Youth Music Strategy \(2006\), and a further report on the professional development and training of those who work with young people through music *A Sound Investment: Workforce Development in Music Education* \(2008\). A detailed analysis of sectoral data and stakeholder perceptions resulted in recommendations that included embedding funding for CPD within all awards, and a specific strategic fund that practitioners could access directly. 

 This research partnership continued with Broad’s secondment in 2012 to Creative Scotland \(the successor organisation to the SAC\) as lead researcher in the development of *Time To Shine: Scotland’s Youth Arts Strategy;* it was extended by a series of reports for Creative Scotland and the Scottish Government, including both original research and research syntheses such as *The Wider Benefits of Instrumental Music* *Learning in Childhood* \(Drury\), and by contributions to policy developments such as *A Culture Strategy for Scotland* \(Broad, member of 6\-person academic reference group\). 

 In 2018, Creative Scotland worked with the Music Education Partnership Group \(MEPG\), a partnership of around 60 organisations working in music education in Scotland, to commission a follow up to *WGO*. Following a competitive tender process, the contract was again won by the Conservatoire in partnership with the University of Strathclyde, leading to a fully updated study with a remit extending to classroom music and national qualifications, led by Broad, with Dr Lio Moscardini, Andrew Rae, Katie Hunter, Alasdair Wilson and Graeme Smillie, published in February 2019. 

 The follow up study was published as *What’s Going On Now?* \( *WGON*\) and examined data on music education and participation in conjunction with stakeholder surveys \(n=1391\) and detailed case studies of music making in contrasting locations based on key informant interviews. 

 The analysis in *WGON* suggested a range of significant issues facing music education in Scotland – including inequalities of opportunity, a supply\-led system that inhibits demand, weaknesses in progression, and poor understanding of the value of music. At the same time, though, it revealed \(in the words of John Wallace, then chair of MEPG\) a ‘buoyant’ sector ‘overwhelming in its sheer vibrancy’. Though music education in Scotland is a fragile ecology, the YMI is a vital part of the ecosystem.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *WGO* has been influential in shaping successive Scottish governments’ policies towards to youth music and, together with a continuing body of research undertaken by the Conservatoire, remains a foundation for policy, planning and funding of youth music across Scotland. 

 In the REF Assessment Period \(AP\) £75.1m has been disbursed by the YMI, £60.6m to Scottish local authorities by means of the formula designed by the research team of *WGO*, and a further £14.5m through individual awards made by Creative Scotland. 

 A key recommendation of *WGO* was that there should be advocacy for ‘ **youth music opportunities, as an entitlement, for all young people in Scotland’** and that **‘ways of targeting support to Primary schools’** should be sought. The YMI took this up, with an initial target that every child in Scotland would receive a year’s free music tuition by the end of Primary 6 \(later generalised to a year’s free tuition before the end of Primary school\). According to Creative Scotland’s data, this was achieved in 2006 and around £7.2m per annum is now spent to sustain this target year on year though initiatives that complement, but are distinct from, local authorities’ music tuition services. 

 *WGO* recommended the foundation of funding schemes ‘ **to support strategic priorities within the informal sectors’**. Those strategic priorities included new access opportunities and actions to offer the informal sector ‘ **greater support and advocacy**’. *WGO* also argued for the establishment of ‘ **different levels of funding schemes including easy\-to\-access awards schemes for smaller projects and longer\-term schemes for sustaining successful existing projects**’. These recommendations informed the YMI approach to supporting the informal and nonformal sectors. Creative Scotland disburses around £1.5m per annum through two complementary schemes: the ‘Access to Music Making’ \(AMM\) and ‘Strengthening Youth Music’ \(SYM\) schemes. Between 2014 and 2019, nearly £10.25m was invested through the AMM scheme, and a further £667k through the SYM initiative. 

 The effect on the employment context for music leaders has been significant, with \(for example\) 1582 jobs supported by YMI funding in 2017\-18. 

 *WGO* recommended that ‘ **both formal and informal sectors \[should\] work together and co\-ordinate activities … to achieve coherence and complementarity**’. The ‘Formula Fund’ enabled local authorities to employ a much wider range of artists and musicians and work in partnership with organisations in the informal sector, often for the first time. Similarly, in configuring the AMM and SYM schemes, Creative Scotland established an expectation for partnership working in the scheme guidance \(‘Who are you working with?’ etc.\). 

 Analysis of funding data in 2002 showed a **deep divide in the funding experiences of organisations working in different genres** of music – with those offering young people tuition in Western Classical music very much better funded that any other genre. Allied to this was an issue that the researchers called ‘cultural approval’ \- broadly, the perception held by practitioners working in Traditional music and Rock, Pop and Dance that they were ‘second class citizens’ of the musical world. In funding more diverse musical opportunities, the YMI has been in the vanguard of sea change at Creative Scotland that can be observed in the stylistic diversity of their current Regularly Funded Organisations. 

 In particular, *WGO* highlighted the **lack of developmental opportunities for young rock and pop musicians** in 2002. The YMI responded to this by developing and supporting initiatives for burgeoning stars: during the AP, the YMI\-supported Hit the Road programme, for example, has supported 45 young emerging artists to tour Scotland. Lewis Capaldi \(Brit Awards 2020 Winner Best New Artist and Song of the Year\) has highlighted Hit the Road and the YMI as pivotal in the development of his career. 

 *WGO* also noted that **‘singing … was seen as the most obvious weakness’ of the Scottish scene** in 2002, and the YMI has strongly supported the National Youth Choir of Scotland to broaden its developmental role and significantly increase its reach across Scotland and beyond, such that during the AP it has hosted the Symposium of the International Kodaly Society \(2015\), and given performances of Berlioz’s *Lalio* at Carnegie Hall \(2018\) and the Philharmonie de Paris \(2019\). 

 *WGO* highlighted that **early years music was a major gap in provision** in 2002. The YMI’s response to this finding in funding the Scottish Book Trust’s Bookbug initiative is a good illustration of the reach and significance of the impact of the YMI, which has supported these music and language sessions for the very young \(usually held in local libraries\) since 2007; in the AP, the YMI has supported the training of 2534 Bookbug Session Leaders and a further 139 local trainers, resulting in around 1.8m attendances by young children at Bookbug sessions. 

 *WGO* highlighted an **‘urgent need for a framework of opportunities for practitioners to gain initial training, to update existing skills**’. This need was unpacked in more detail in *A Sound Investment* \(2007\). In response to this, Creative Scotland built in to all YMI funding schemes expectations for training and a CPD budget. In total, for example, 5,826 youth music practitioners benefitted from YMI funded training 2017\-18. In addition, Creative Scotland has devolved to the Scottish Music Centre a sum from the SYM budget to which individuals can apply; this has disbursed a total of £390k in the AP directly to practitioners. 

 As noted above, the Conservatoire was contracted to update *WGO* in 2018, in a study that was published in 2019 as *What’s Going On Now?* \( *WGON*\). The Scottish Government undertook to respond to the findings of the research in its Programme for Government 2018\-19, and invited a briefing to inform the thinking of the Deputy First Minister John Swinney. Following an extended campaign by MEPG and a senior team at the Conservatoire, all major parties contending the 2021 Scottish Parliamentary Elections have incorporated key recommendations from *WGON* in their manifestos, including a commitment to make music tuition in schools free; the Scottish National Party manifesto specifically namechecks the YMI. Parallel to this, the Music Education Partnership Group \- co\-commissioners of *WGON* \- has pursued its developmental recommendations through its We Make Music programme \( [www.wemakemusicscotland.org](http://www.wemakemusicscotland.org/)\). 

 The number of young people on whom the YMI has had an impact over its 18\-year history is very large, and successive impact evaluations commissioned by Creative Scotland indicate the reach of the initiative: based on these evaluations, we estimate that in the assessment period alone, around 1.5 million young people have had an initial experience of music at school through the YMI, and at least 500,000 had participated in out of school activities.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Autism Centre Education and Research \(ACER\) has **challenged the prevalent misconception that autism is a disorder, rather than a different way of being**. In so doing, we have empowered teachers to see autistic children and young people \(CYP\) as having different and distinct learning needs, rather than being ‘faulty’, ‘problematic’ and in need of ‘fixing’ \(as the ‘deficit’ view assumes\). We have impacted education practitioners in a way that protects the education rights and interests of autistic children and young people. Together with the Autism Education Trust \(AET\), we have: 

1.  **Transformed how education stakeholders nationally and internationally understand and value autistic pupils;** 

1.  **Systematically enabled teachers to adopt improved, pupil\-centred approaches** which transform the educational experience of autistic pupils **;** 

1.  **Enabled the AET to position themselves as a key authority on best practice for national Autism Education;** 

1.  **Transformed the infrastructure and organisation of autism support and provision in** **England.** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 There are over 120,000 autistic pupils in England’s schools, of which over 70% are educated in mainstream provision. In England, autistic children and young people \(CYP\) are three times more likely to be regularly and unlawfully excluded from school for a fixed period than children who do not have special educational needs. Autism is a complex condition that impacts daily functioning. Therefore, autistic CYP require distinctive support to be successful at school \(R1, R2\). But without research\-based knowledge of autism, staff in education settings often apply generalist understandings of ‘good’ education to autistic learners, without making adjustments \(R2, R3\). This problem is compounded by gaps between research evidence on autism, education and teachers’ everyday practices \(R4\). There is a significant and pressing need for educators to access and use the best evidence and guidance available to support autistic CYP to succeed. In short, education staff need support to develop better understandings, attitudes towards and classroom practice for autistic pupils \(R3\). ACER’s research has contributed conceptually and empirically to informing practice and policy on ‘good autism education’. This has included the development of a distinctive pedagogy for autistic pupils \(R1–R6\). Findings that shaped this distinctive pedagogy include, but are not limited to: 

 **F1.** **Strengths:** Good autism practice shifts the focus on to autistic people’s strengths, rather than emphasising their deficits. This includes viewing autism as a different, rather than disordered, way of being \(R5\). 

 **F2.** **Differences:** There are four key areas of difference that inform how autistic CYP learn. These are: interacting and developing relationships; processing information; taking in and perceiving sensory information; and communicating, understanding and using language \(R6\). 

 **F3.** **Inclusion:** Instead of adapting an existing curriculum to accommodate autistic pupils, the curriculum needs to be inclusive of all at its root. Teachers must accommodate autistic CYP’s distinctive needs into the curriculum by making changes to the physical, sensory and social environment, and by prioritising the above four areas of learning difference \(R1, R6\). 

 **F4.** **Participation:** Autistic CYP must be engaged in decisions affecting them, and good education outcomes will engage each individual’s needs and aspirations \(R2, R4, R3\). 

 **F5.** **Pupil\-centredness:** Knowledge of each individual pupil is vital to developing good autism education practice \(R3, R4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **ACER has developed a distinctive conceptual framework and pedagogy** \(F1–F5\). The framework is a key component of the **Autism Education Trust’s \(AET\) continuing professional development programme \(CPD\)**, co\-created by ACER and the AET \(S1\). This partnership has to date **trained 275,000 education staff** across England \(S1\). The CPD programme consists of \(1\) a **set of autism standards** \(for educational settings to assess autism practice in education\); \(2\) an **autism competency framework** \(guidance on the knowledge, skills and competencies needed by practitioners\) and \(3\) **autism training for** **educators**. The roll\-out of this programme has produced a step\-change in autism education practice demonstrated in the following four impacts. We have: 

1.  <ins> **Transformed how education stakeholders nationally and internationally understand and value autistic C</ins><ins>hildren and</ins> <ins>Y</ins><ins>oung</ins> <ins>P</ins><ins>eople**</ins> 

 The AET programme **champions a strengths\-based approach**, rather than a deficit\-based approach, to meeting the needs of children and young people in their education \(F2\). This is attested to by a trainer who confirmed the programme has “changed the way we conduct training for staff. We now focus on the differences and strengths of pupils with autism rather than their deficits” \(S2 p.30; F3\). 

 This programme is not simply changing how *individual* educators understand and value autistic CYP. It is also **setting the standard for** **best practice nationally**. As described by Pam Simpson, AET Lead in Birmingham City Council: “we now have a structured and consistent response, based on research principles and aligned to key legislation, supported by the DFE” \(S2, p.16\). The programme is the only CPD programme referenced in the 2014 Special Educational Needs and Disability Code of Practice \(S3 p.276\) and signposted as key training \(S2\). It is now the largest national training programme on autism in England for education\-based staff \(S1\). 

 The most recent intervention is the **development of eight principles of good autism practice** and detailed case studies of good autism practice in eight schools. These were produced by ACER and funded by the AET \(2018–2019\) \(S1\). These principles have been endorsed by the AET Young Persons Panel, feature as a framework for a large postgraduate professional development programme for autism practitioners and are used in the AET’s bite\-size messages regarding good autism practice. They are currently being used as a framework for a re\-development and update of the AET professional development programme \(S4\). 

 **ACER has also challenged conventional medical** **conceptions of autism in Italy and Greece**, again shifting narratives from ‘disorder’ to a ‘different way of being’. That understandings were effectively changed is confirmed by a Greek participant, who stated “I was impressed by the different approach towards autism and autistic people: the approach was very different compared to the Greek medical model of understanding autism. It changed the way I understood autism \[…\] I felt very excited thinking that autism needn’t be considered a tragedy \(as it commonly is perceived in Greece\)” \(S5 p.10\). We achieved this impact through work with 110 Schools in Greece and 200 staff in Italy, funded by the EU \(2014–2017\) \(S6\). The **Greek Ministry of Education have endorsed the provision of the \(translated and adapted\) professional development programme** throughout Piraeus and Athens \(S6 p.17\). 

 **\(2\) <ins>Systematically enabled educators to adopt improved, pupil\-centred approaches which transform the educational experience of autistic pupils**</ins> 

 Leadership in schools is **better informed about autism, more able to address the professional development needs of staff and have a framework for auditing existing practice, as well as providing a good local offer for pupils with autism** \(S2 pp.15\-26, S7; F1–F6\). This research\-informed professional leadership has been highly effective in raising the capacity of schools to meet the needs of CYP on the autism spectrum \(S7, S8; F1\). One participant reported that they “now used visual prompts and provided simple instructions. She felt she could adapt her teaching to individual student needs now, could prevent crisis and manage difficult situations and that the child had reduced meltdowns and collaborated more with others as a result of her improved practices” \(S6 p.53\). 

 **We have established a shared baseline of knowledge which changed planning at school\-wide level** using a strategic and collaborative approach \(S2 pp.15\-26, S5\). For example, in one nursery, where all staff had been trained, the head teacher said: ‘the standards were just amazing for us and we audited not just the resource base but the entire school. \[…\] During that first year what we also did was use the standards to set performance management objectives for the staff who were then based in the resource base. That gave a very clear indication of where we needed to go as a school’ \(S8 p.68\). Targeted and specialist support within their settings is reported by staff across four training hubs \(networks of schools, local authorities and the voluntary sector\), thereby meeting the needs of all children \(S7; F1–F6\) and facilitating educators in acting on their new understanding of pupil\-centred approaches. Improved knowledge and understanding have allowed assessments that accurately reflect the child’s needs, gain the views of CYP and use these to make reasonable adjustments in schools \(S8 pp. 81\-129; F2, F4\). In 2018, two thirds of those who had received the AET training stated they were still using practical ideas and guidance from the training \(S1\). Case studies of two schools in Greece and Italy, undertaken two years after the CPD had taken place, show teachers continuing to take account of the distinctive learning needs of autistic pupils in developing enabling environments \(S5\). 

1.  <ins> **Enabled the AET to position themselves as a key authority on best practice for national Autism Education**</ins> 

 ACER’s collaboration has enabled the AET to position themselves as **a trusted national leader and valued government** **lobbyist** for matters concerning Autism Education. That AET is so regarded is evidenced by its receipt of £1.5 million funding from the UK’s Department of Education \(DfE\) between 2011 and 2013. The funding supported the development and delivery of the AET professional development programme to staff in mainstream Early Years settings and schools. The AET has secured over £2 million of subsequent funding from the DfE every two years to date. Further evidence of the AET’s standing comes from the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Autism \(APPGA\) report, which described the AET as having a “strong track record in developing training materials and delivering good quality training to schools. The AET has also published a set of national standards on good autism practice. This should have a key role in contributing to the delivery of the new ITT framework and to ongoing training for teachers and other school staff” \(S9\). In addition, the AET won Corporate Vision magazine, Private Education and Development Awards Best Autism Education Training Company in the UK in 2019. The AET Director described ACER as being “instrumental in the development of the AET programme. The content of the AET programme, developed by ACER, is of high standard. ACER embedded their research and distinctive pedagogy in the AET programme and were a leading organisation in the development of the AET partnership” \(S1\). 

 **\(4\)  <ins>Transformed the infrastructure and organisation of autism support and provision in**</ins> <ins> **England**</ins> 

 Local authority \(LA\) provision to support autistic CYP has undergone a step\-change in both the organisation and cost\-effectiveness. **The training now reaches 50% of the 24,821 schools in England** due to the strategic changes in organisation outlined below. **Cost\-effectiveness has also been improved**, as the reduction in exclusions of autistic CYP in one Local Authority has also led to a reduction in the cost of their education \(S10\). Given that the Institute for Public Policy Research \(2017\) estimates the costs of exclusions at around £370,000 per young person, economic modelling indicates that the Communication and Autism team in Birmingham alone potentially saves the public purse approximately £169 million by embedding the AET programme and reducing exclusions \(S10\). In addition, Communication and Autism team data shows that the number of pupils that have remained in mainstream education has risen as a result of the implementation of the training across the LA. Between 2016 and 2019, 4% more pupils were educated in mainstream rather than specialist provisions. As the average cost of specialist provision in the LA is £67,000 per year per child, a 4% increase equates to a saving of £11 million \(S10\). Examples of infrastructure change to improve autism provision include: 

-  **Training ‘hubs’ have been introduced in which training providers work together** on delivery \(S1\). Hubs consist of a range of organisations, including local authorities, the voluntary sector and schools. When the AET programme was launched, seven hubs were involved in delivering training between 2011–2013. As of 2019, **73 out of a total of 150 LAs across all of the nine regions of England** are involved in the AET programme. Staff across four training hubs surveyed by the AET stated that the programme framework has enabled staff to develop their knowledge and skills to deliver universal, targeted and specialist support within their settings, thereby meeting the needs of all children \(S6 p.39; F1–F6\). 

-  **The AET programme is now core LA training **.** Case studies of four of the LAs that deliver the programme found that 82% of schools in Leicestershire have undertaken the training \(S6\).

 **Summary of the impact** 

 Multi\-unit leaders \(or area managers\), who work in service chains, directly impact organisational growth. The research of the Business School has provided the intellectual backbone through which successive cohorts of area managers have been developed. Dissemination enabled over 800 multi\-site managers, in 22 organisations, to use research results, models and frameworks, to enhance their practice, progression and performance. When surveyed, 94% agreed the programme improved their impact and performance, with 97% agreeing that AMUL research was integral to this success. Testimonials from service chain business leaders confirmed multiple qualitative and quantitative impacts on their organisations’ culture, sales and growth. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The AMUL has drawn on the research expertise of three academics who have delivered the Multi\-Unit Leadership \(MUL\) Programme. Edger, who is lead of AMUL, instigated this research **\(R1\)**, with a comprehensive study of area management practice in 21 service chain organisations \(including Sainsbury’s, Lloyds Bank, Rank, Greggs, Mitchells and Butlers, and Greene King\). This used a mixed\-methods approach \(including qualitative case study, and secondary quantitative survey data\), to establish what constituted high performance multi\-unit leader impacts on service chain growth. The outcome was an ‘Effective MUL Model’, which provided \(a hitherto lacking\) framework for outstanding area management practice. The underlying typology highlighted how three key activities \(service\-led sales, systems implementation, and standards enforcement\) were driven through three dominant behavioural practices \(commitment, control and change\), underpinned by three critical personal characteristics \(emotional intelligence, expertise and energy\). Central to this model was the notion of Portfolio Optimisation through Social Exchange \(POSE\). This established that upper quartile operators consistently outperformed their peers by reducing geographical and psychological distance between themselves and their followers. This was achieved through outstanding local leadership practice. The ‘Effective MUL Model’, and its attendant notions of POSE and local leadership, helped participants to extend their practice, beyond ‘managerialism’, accelerating their development into high performance multi\-unit leaders. 

 Further research by Edger **\(R2\)** has elaborated on this, and explored franchising as a specific form of multi\-unit operation. This was based on an examination of 19 case studies, exclusively concentrating on service\-based franchise\-chain leadership. 

 This MUL content has been enhanced by the research of Lichtenstein. Initial work explored emotional intelligence \(see also **R1**\) and the relationship between executive decision\-making and personal values. This has been delivered to AMUL cohorts, focussing on how personal values — the framework of beliefs that guide one’s actions — influence decision\-making at work **\(R3\)**. Using mixed\-methods and focus groups, this work demonstrated the efficacy of a behavioural strategy approach, and offered support for Maslow’s motivational theory, which is a foundational model in the AMUL programmes. This analysis was extended **\(R4\)** to consider multi\-unit leadership in public sector organisations, exploring the usefulness of strategic planning in the UK police force. This work offered a deeper understanding of the planning\-performance relationship in a more “formal” multi\-unit context. 

 The research of Psychogios **\(R5, R6\)** has also been a strand in the leadership CPD offered by the AMUL. Psychogios’s research, based on in\-depth qualitative investigation in various companies, suggests that managers are frequently reluctant to use formal mechanisms to provide constructive feedback about, for example, changing existing processes. Instead, they prefer informal methods of feedback that work better in enhancing the achievements of targets, as well as in organisational change. More specifically, two features of feedback are proposed as enhancing this process: benefits\-oriented \(performance\) and confidence\-oriented \(motivation\). As such, Psychogios proposes a three\-fold form of feedback through which managers in multi\-unit organisations, and more generally, can expand their perspectives of feedback from feeding\-back to feeding\-forward, thereby enhancing the confidence of employees and their resilience in dealing with turbulence. 

 The strength of this collective body of work lies in its emergent frameworks, which area managers, and managers in general, can use to enhance their multi\-site leadership performance.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 AMUL research has informed, and was disseminated through, a suite of postgraduate programmes. Since its inception, the programmes have been delivered to over 800 delegates, and 22 UK organisations, including the following. 

  

-  Four of the leading pub\-restaurant chains in the UK: Stonegate Group **\(S01\)**; Greene King **\(S02\)**; Mitchells and Butlers **;** and, Marstons. 

-  The UK’s largest hotel chain, Premier Inn. 

-  Builders’ merchants, including the UK’s largest, St Gobain **\(S03\)**, and cohorts through the Builders Merchant Federation **\(S04\)**. 

-  The UK’s largest land\-based leisure gaming company, Rank Plc **\(S05\)**. 

-  Other fast growing SMEs \(including Oakman Inns **S06**\). 

 Impacts from the cohorts which studied prior to 2014 are still being felt. Indicating the commercial sector’s confidence in the significance of this work, and willingness to pay accordingly, the programme generated income of £775,500 to the Business School over the REF period. Moreover, many clients had commissioned successive cohorts 2014\-2020, thereby demonstrating the ongoing value that these companies attached to the unique content of the programmes. 

 **4.1. Managerial Impacts** 

 There are various AMUL models, which have impacted managerial practice. Most significantly, the conceptual ‘Effective MUL Model’ was formulated while researching at the outset of the programme, and published shortly thereafter **\(R01\)**. It provides an overarching framework for participants in the programmes to enhance their practice and performance within industry \(evidenced in 4.2 below\). In a 2020 survey of participants **\(S07\)**: 

-  97% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that AMUL’s <ins>research</ins> was integral to the success of the AMUL programme; and, 

-  94% of respondents acknowledged that their day\-to\-day management practice, as middle managers, continued to be informed by the knowledge and understanding gained from this research. 

 Respondents also pointed to the support this framework provided in responding to the COVID\-19 pandemic, benefitting them with the structure it provided. Significantly, 94% of respondents confirmed that their business impact and personal performance had improved as a result of participating in the research\-informed AMUL programme **\(S07\)**. Also, 85% of respondents agreed that attending the programme had enhanced their chances for progression. 57% confirmed that they had been promoted in this REF period, with 93% agreeing that the programme gave them greater levels of aspiration. 

 Other frameworks were used to good effect by organisations. For example, the three\-fold\-feedback framework has been adopted by 11 organisations, and 89% reported they used three\-fold feedback often. All respondents stated that managers’ feedback had improved, with 77% reporting feedback had improved very much, or considerably \( **S08, S09**\). This attests to the AMUL impacts on management practice. 

  

 **4.2. Organisational and Sector Impacts** 

 Written testimonials from the service chain clients of the MUL Programme — who commissioned a succession of multi\-site manager cohorts from 2014\-20 — also support its growth impact on their organisations. 

 The CEO of Stonegate **\(S01\)** stated that, from 2015\-2020, the MUL Programme had ‘substantially strengthened the operational middle’ of the organisation \(decreasing area manager turnover from 40%, to single figures\). It had assisted their £69M to £145M EBITDA growth \(growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\), which is a 15% compound annual growth rate. This placed Stonegate in a strong position for its subsequent £1.25Bn takeover of the Ei Group, making it the largest pub company in the UK. 

 The MD of Greene King stated that the Multi\-Unit Programmes supported its ‘vital multi\-site cohorts’. This enabled his company to outperform their ‘competitive set by up to 2% in like\-for\-like sales over the period’, adding that ‘without exception, I saw the individuals grow in both expertise and confidence, thinking and acting more strategically’ **\(S02\)**. The CEO of St Gobain **\(S04\)** stated that the programmes had contributed to their ‘relative industry outperformance’ over the duration, with its Head of People Development and Career Management stating that the courses’ impact extended beyond developing staff, to ‘addressing issues vital for the company’, such as digitalisation **\(S03\)**. In addition, the Chairman of the BMF stated that the programme ‘accelerated the growth ambitions’ of its member firms **\(S04\).** 

 The Chairman of Rank stated that the research\-informed post\-graduate programmes ensured ‘that we continued to outstrip the competition’ **\(S05\)**. Also, the Operations Director of Oakman Inns maintained that the MUL Programme ‘greatly assisted the organisation’s growth from 8 to 24 units’ over the period 2015\-2020. Furthermore, he added: ‘in my view the MUL Programme has been pivotal in increasing the ‘smarts’ of our multi\-site leadership in Oakman Inns … It is the only programme in the UK that is focused on improving the capability and performance of multi\-site operators — something that has had a very positive effect on the financial and unit growth of Oakman over the past five years’ **\(S06\)**. 

 At a sectoral level, the Founder and MD of Propel, which organises the London Multi\-site Leader Masterclasses \(attended by hundreds of leisure executives\), has attested that the books and industry\-related articles produced by AMUL have ‘provided thought leadership at all levels of the \(leisure\) sector’ and its programmes have had a ‘ripple effect’ as many of the area managers ‘who have graduated from the courses … gravitate to the senior echelons of the UK food and beverage sector’ **\(S10\)**. This overarching testimonial demonstrates the profound impact from the Academy for MUL on the sector, triangulating the evidence of research impact from participants and senior executives.

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Nuclear plants pose many challenges in relation to hydrogen safety. An uncontrolled release of hydrogen \(generated through radiolysis and corrosion\) in a plant enclosure with a suitable ignition source could result in an explosion with potential loss of human life, significant infrastructural damage and environmental impact due to radioactive contamination, as occurred at Fukushima in 2011. Even a small hydrogen explosion incident at Sellafield could delay or shut down operations and incur significant costs of the order of GBP1,000,000 \(£1m\) per day. 

 The London South Bank University \(LSBU\) Explosion and Fire Research Team has had a significant impact on the safe management of hydrogen hazards, through its collaboration with Sellafield Ltd, a large multi\-function nuclear site close to Seascale in Cumbria, England. This research work has helped Sellafield Ltd to: 

-  Support a revolutionary breakthrough saving approximately GBP100,000,000 \(£100m\) on cleaning up the Sellafield site. 

-  Design a process to safely stack and store nuclear waste filled boxes which generate hydrogen as a by\-product \(\~10,000 boxes each costing GBP60,000 \(£60k\)\). 

-  Safely transfer special nuclear materials containing plutonium from Dounreay \(DSRL\) to Sellafield for secure long\-term storage. 

-  Improve operator safety by ascertaining the potential consequences of explosions involving small volumes of hydrogen. 

-  Gain industry recognition with a “Highly Commended” award in the Process Safety category at the IChemE Global Awards 2015.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Sellafield Ltd \(SL\) manage the UK’s largest nuclear site, which presents a unique and diverse range of complex challenges due to 60 years of varied nuclear operations. Covering six square kilometres, it is home to more than two hundred nuclear facilities and the largest inventory of untreated nuclear waste in Europe. The hazardous radioactive nature of this waste means it must be carefully managed and stored for thousands of years. Retrieval operations are therefore required to transfer the nuclear waste, fuel and sludge that are currently stored inside legacy ponds and silos into robust radiation\-shielded boxes that are better suited to long term storage. 

 The storage of this waste also leads to the generation of hydrogen gas through radiolysis and corrosion. This hydrogen must be carefully managed since an uncontrolled release inside a plant enclosure could result in an explosion with potential loss of human life, significant infrastructural damage and environmental impact due to radioactive contamination, as occurred at Fukushima in 2011. 

 Even a small hydrogen explosion incident could delay/shutdown storage operations and incur significant costs. Such a hydrogen incident at Sellafield involving a Magnox encapsulation plant swarf flask in 1996 resulted in plant shutdown for months at an estimated cost of GBP1,000,000 \(£1m\) per day. As a result of this incident the SL Hydrogen Working Party \(HWP\) was formed to generate common guidance and act as a focal point for advice on hydrogen related issues. The work of the HWP has now been encompassed within the SL Flammable Gases Centre of Expertise \(FGCoE\). SL entered into a long\-term partnership with LSBU Explosion and Fire Research Team in 2012 on the basis of their expertise in the field of hydrogen safety and strong research track record. 

 The research carried out by LSBU has been, and continues to be, funded by Sellafield Ltd. \(\~£3M since 2000\). The objective of the research has been to underpin the development of a comprehensive Hydrogen Technical Guide \(HTG\) to safely manage hydrogen and solve problems arising due to hydrogen generation that occur across the Sellafield site. To meet this objective, the LSBU Explosion & Fire Research Team \(Drs Ingram, Holborn, Battersby, Averill and Benson\) have undertaken a range of underpinning research studies for Sellafield Ltd  The findings of these studies include: 

 **Mechanical ignition of hydrogen\-air \(August 2008 – Present\):** Heavy machinery \(grabs cranes etc.\) and manual handling used in waste retrieval and transfer operations has the potential to generate hot surfaces and sparks through contact friction and drop impacts which could ignite a flammable hydrogen gas mixture resulting in an explosion. This work characterised the likelihood of ignition of hydrogen\-air atmospheres due to mechanical stimuli for different velocities and masses, projectile geometries, types of material and surface conditions. Novel experimental tests were conducted using surface friction and drop weight impact rigs to quantify the hydrogen\-air ignition probability under conditions which had not previously been studied before \(e.g. for high loads up to 1 tonne\), simulating what might occur when using heavy machinery during decommissioning operations at Sellafield **\[R1, R2\]**. It determined that the effect of pyrophoric materials, hard surfaces and wet corroded Magnox sludge on sliding friction all make the ignition of hydrogen far more likely to occur, even under low velocity contact sliding conditions \(< 1m/s\) previously thought to pose little risk **\[R3\]**. The research derived new and useful theoretical relationships for calculating impact energies from the initial drop impact velocities. It also identified for the first time the key role of even very small amounts of grease contamination in greatly reducing the friction coefficient and significantly changing projectile impact behaviour **\[R4\]**. The results inform the quantified risk assessment of the process and storage operations carried out on nuclear plants, predicting those conditions \- velocities, masses, materials \(steel, magnesium, aluminium etc.\) and surface conditions \(clean/rusty/Magnox coated etc.\) \- where ignition of hydrogen would be likely to occur and which must be mitigated against and those where it can be ruled out as being highly unlikely or not credible. 

 **Buoyancy driven flow and diffusion for removing hydrogen \(July 2016 – Feb 2019\):** 

 During decommissioning operations carried out at Sellafield, nuclear waste will be retrieved from legacy silos and placed in purpose built robust shielded skips and boxes for secure long\-term storage. The waste placed in the boxes will generate hydrogen. Filters will therefore be fitted to the lids to prevent the build\-up of flammable concentrations of hydrogen. Furthermore, the boxes will be stacked with a small horizontal channel being formed between each lower box and the box above it in the stack. The hydrogen released via the filters in the top of the skip/box must also therefore be able to flow through the narrow horizontal channel between the boxes and safely dispersed. This work investigated the performance of buoyancy driven flow and diffusion in removing hydrogen \(using helium as a safe analogue\) from waste storage boxes via filters fitted to the lids and the narrow channels formed between the stacked boxes. The experimental tests characterised the effect of different filter designs \(e.g. areas, spacings\) and horizontal channel sizes on hydrogen gas transport behaviour. The experimental results suggest that for narrow channels, less than 20 mm high, buoyancy driven flow will be significantly inhibited. The results were also used to construct a Bayesian network predicting the effect of different plant conditions on the likelihood of a flammable hydrogen atmosphere forming **\[R5\]**. 

 **Explosion consequences of small volumes of hydrogen \(Jan 2017 \- July 2017\):** This work investigated the explosion consequences of ignition of small volumes of hydrogen such as could form in bagged bottles containing radioactive materials stored at Sellafield **\[R6\]**. The results characterised the impulse/temperature/pressure behaviour exhibited by hydrogen bag/balloon ignitions via detailed measurements and high\-speed video footage of the explosions. The work addressed a knowledge gap in the understanding of hydrogen bag ignitions and identified the harmful effect of overpressure to the ears as being the main risk to operators working in close proximity to a bagged bottle containing hydrogen.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact and reach of LSBU’s work for Sellafield Ltd and other nuclear sites managed by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority \(NDA\) across the UK \(e.g. Dounreay DSRL\) is corroborated by the Sellafield testimonial statement **\[S1\]**. The results have been used to inform Sellafield operations and address knowledge gaps regarding the **effect of mechanical stimuli** \(i.e. different masses, velocities, surface condition\) upon the likelihood of ignition of hydrogen\-air mixtures \(see section 2\) \- feeding into the continuing **evolution of the Hydrogen Technical Guide** \(HTG\) \- a comprehensive guide to hydrogen hazards and their management – and assisting in the **development of safety cases** for **nuclear decommissioning** operations **\[S2\]**. The HTG is now used across the Sellafield sites and the NDA Estate and is widely regarded, both nationally and internationally, as being the best practice guide to hydrogen safety in the nuclear industry. The international importance of the development of the HTG was recognised at the IChemE Global Awards 2015 where Sellafield Ltd and LSBU were jointly awarded the accolade of “Highly Commended” in the Process Safety category **\[S3\]**. 

 Specific examples of the impact of LSBU’s research work at Sellafield Ltd are: 

 **1\) Informing a breakthrough in the management of nuclear waste at Sellafield** 

 The group’s underpinning research on ignition of hydrogen\-air mixtures due to mechanical stimuli was used by Sellafield Ltd to inform the development of an alternative approach to managing Intermediate Level Waste \(ILW\) from one of their legacy silos \- the Magnox Swarf Storage Silo \(MSSS\). The new approach represents a revolutionary breakthrough in the management of nuclear waste and is designed to accelerate progress at Sellafield and save approximately GBP100,000,000 \(£100m\) for cleaning up the site **\[S4\]**. SL were able to use LSBU’s results characterising the likelihood of ignition due to mechanical stimuli to help make an informed judgement on the behaviour of the raw waste retrieved from MSSS and so produce a safe and secure waste package, suitable for interim storage, using a far more straightforward approach – saving time and reducing costs. In a statement announcing the research breakthrough **\[S4\]**. Dr Adrian Simper, the NDA’s Strategy and Technology Director, said: 

 *“This research has delivered the underpinning to what could be a paradigm shift in the management of nuclear waste. Having a greater understanding of the long\-term behaviour of this material allows us to design a truly fit\-for\-purpose approach to its management and disposal. To be able to deliver a technical solution to historic ILW at Sellafield, which not only offers a safe and secure route but also opens up the possibility of a quicker and cheaper alternative to current technology, is a genuinely exciting development.”* 

 **2\) Assisting Sellafield to assess and optimise the safe design of stacked filtered boxes for waste storage** 

 The Sellafield Alternative Intermediate Level Waste Approach \(AILWA\) project for managing MSSS waste will retrieve waste directly into special purpose shielded boxes without further treatment, saving time and reducing costs. This is a huge undertaking since between 10,000 to 20,000 bespoke storage boxes will be required, with each box costing around GBP60,000 \(£60k\). LSBU’s underpinning research work \(July 2016 – Feb 2019\) on buoyancy\-driven gas flow and diffusion of a buoyant gas \(using helium as a safe analogue for hydrogen\) from a filtered box via a narrow horizontal channel has been used by Sellafield Ltd to inform and optimise the safe design of stacked filtered boxes for AILWA e.g. by predicting how big the gap channel needs to be **\[S5, S6, S7, S8\]**. Such designs permit the effective removal of hydrogen from the waste boxes, mitigating the risk of a highly damaging and costly explosion event occurring, whilst also allowing the number of boxes that can be safely stacked in the available storage space to be maximised, thereby reducing operation costs. 

 **3\) Improve risk assessment methodology and operator safety by understanding the potential consequences of explosions involving small volumes of hydrogen** 

 LSBU have also carried out \(Jan \- July 2017\) underpinning research work investigating the consequences of ignition of small volumes of hydrogen such as could form in bagged bottles containing radioactive materials stored at Sellafield **\[S9\]**. Rebottling activities for analytical purposes require that operators in air\-fed suits must periodically pick up and move such packages/bottles. Research was therefore required to better understand and characterise what the likely consequences of a hydrogen explosion event might be. This novel piece of work has proved very useful to Sellafield Ltd in relation to specific manual handling operations, enabling the adequacy of personal protective equipment for such tasks to be assessed e.g. by highlighting the importance of wearing ear protection. In many cases it has also allowed operations to continue without significant delay or the potentially considerable cost of implementing additional protective measures. 

 **4\) Support the transfer of special nuclear material product packages from Dounreay to Sellafield.** 

 One of the most complex challenges in dealing with the UK’s nuclear legacy is the management of the inventory of special nuclear materials containing plutonium held in the UK. The safe and secure handling and storage of this plutonium inventory is a UK government priority due to concerns over its security and proliferation. Operations were therefore required to transfer a large number of special nuclear material product packages containing plutonium from Dounreay \(DSRL\) to Sellafield for their secure long\-term storage. However, some of these packages could potentially contain pressurised hydrogen generated via radiolysis of absorbed moisture or organic contaminants. In view of the potential hydrogen challenge associated with the product packages LSBU applied their underpinning research work on the ignition of hydrogen\-air mixtures due to mechanical stimuli to assess the likelihood of ignition occurring due to the potential mechanical and electrostatic stimuli that may arise during manual handling and transfer operations \(Sep \- Nov 2017\) **\[S10\]**. The results were used to inform the package transfer process and identify those packages and operations where ignition of hydrogen was likely to occur and which would require further attention and those where it could be safely ruled out as being highly unlikely or not credible \- hence facilitating their safe transfer to Sellafield.

 **1.Summary of the impact** 

 Sagar and Jones led ‘ **The Student Sex Work Project**’ **\(TSSWP\)**, the first large scale study of student participation in the sex industry. The project provided baseline evidence of the prevalence of sex work among students at all levels of higher education in the UK, and the problems they experienced through the stigma surrounding this work. 

 Adopting a collaborative and participatory approach, the research brought about the following changes that reduced perceived notions of stigma and ultimately improved well\-being: 

-  The establishment of the first e\-health service for student sex workers and improved service provider responses for student sex workers 

-  Enhanced student sex workers’ well\-being through awareness\-raising and policy change within the student body 

-  The empowerment of student sex workers through the inclusion of their voices in public dissemination and debate, film, and the training of professionals

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Work completed between 2012 and 2015, with publications appearing from 2015 to 2016. Led by Professor Tracey Sagar \(Principal Investigator\) and Associate Professor Debbie Jones \(Lead Researcher and Project Manager\) with two Swansea University\-based research assistants, Dr Jacky Tyrie 2012\-2014 and Dr Katrien Symons 2014\-2015. Project partners included Terrence Higgins Trust Cymru \(THT\) \(third sector sexual health service provider\) and Cardiff and Vale NHS \(sexual health service provider\). Consultants contributed at the request of the project leads: the National Union of Students \(NUS\) Cymru \(advisers and gatekeepers\), Sam Geuens \(clinical sexologist\), Professor Roger Tarling \(quantitative expert\) and Dr. Ron Roberts \(publications consultant\). Professor Chris Morris, Newport Film School, produced films for the project \(executive producers: Sagar and Jones\). 

 TSSWP was a participatory action research project involving student sex workers in the research process from its design to completion. Throughout the project lifespan, 7 student sex workers were employed as researchers, with support from approximately 75 student volunteers from Higher Education Institutions across Wales. The student sex worker researchers later played a key role in the dissemination of the research and promoting the changes described below. The underpinning methodology of the project brought together research, service delivery and public engagement with the intention of generating sustainable impact that began with the genesis of the project and continued in an embedded format after the initial project ended **\[R1\]**. 

 The underpinning research comprised three strands: 

1.  **Prevalence, motivation and needs of student sex workers** 

 <ins>E\-h</ins><ins>ea</ins><ins>l</ins><ins>th services and data collection</ins><ins>.</ins> Funded as the first e\-health service for sex workers in Wales, TSSWP was the first study of student sex work to combine data collection and service provision, and to be led by university academics acting as both scientific researchers and support service providers. Data was collected via online instant messenger ‘chat conversations’ with student sex workers \(project members\) who were also offered support and advice. The data provided detailed and previously under\-explored accounts of the lives of student sex workers and highlighted issues of social isolation, stigma, reluctance to access services and lack of safety **\[R1\]**. These findings were used immediately to enhance the service elements of the project thus bringing about evidence\-led impact and both **\[R1\]** and **\[R2\]** underpinned improvements to sexual health service provision and professional practice beyond the project. 

 <ins>Online</ins> <ins>Survey</ins><ins> *.</ins>* TSSWP was the first to study student sex work on a large scale through an online survey. 6,773 survey responses revealed the first statistically significant account of prevalence rates of participation in the sex industry of students in UK Higher Education \(HE\). The key findings from this element of the project were a\) 22% of students responding to the survey had considered sex work and 5% had been involved in some capacity and b\) male students were more likely to engage in sex work than female students. Reasons for involvement were varied. 64% wanted to fund a lifestyle, 56% to cover basic living expenses and 45% to avoid getting into debt. 59% thought they would enjoy the work and 57% were looking to fund their degree **\[R1, R2\]**. The biggest negative impact on the lives of student sex workers was having to keep sex work a secret \(50%\) due to fears of stigma and judgement. The study found that students engaged in sex work were falling through gaps in service delivery with 21% accessing student counselling services but not disclosing their occupations **\[R1, R2\]**. The results indicated the need to break down stigma within the student body with student sex workers fearing being judged by peers and HE staff for what they do rather than who they are **\[R1\]**. 

1.  **Higher Education responses to student sex workers** 

 Sagar and Jones conducted an HE case study with 138 respondents: academics, professional services \(including well\-being, finance, and disability support\) and representatives from NUS Cymru. The key research findings were that respondents a\) felt unable to offer student sex workers support and guidance, b\) felt they had a poor understanding of the legal aspects of sex work and c\) did not know how to tailor support for these students **\[R3\]**. 65% of respondents indicated that online guidance was needed with 63% indicating the need for university policy or guidance around the topic. 55% indicated that they would benefit from face to face training **\[R3\]**. As a result of the findings, the project developed a face\-to\-face and online training package **\[R4\]** to enhance service provision after completion of the study. 

1.  **Stigma and unheard voices** 

 A further research theme was to understand the impact negative stigma has on the lives of student sex workers. Findings from survey responses and TSSWP online resource, netreach \(an online outreach service developed by the project\), indicated that perceived or experienced stigma led to psychological and physical harm to students. Examples included having to keep sex work secret and putting themselves in vulnerable positions through lone working \(as a consequence of working in secret\) **\[R1\]**. They also expressed a need to be heard in both public and policy discourse **\[R1\]**. Therefore, embedded into the research process was the creation of a documentary drama, ‘Fog of Sex’ **\[R5\]**, and a series of short films **\[R6\]** which drew directly on interviews with student sex workers.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **4.1 The establishment of the first e\-health service for student sex workers and improved service provider responses for student sex workers** 

 <ins>Improving student sex worker’s well\-being and safety through</ins> <ins>new</ins> <ins>e</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>health services</ins><ins>.</ins> TSSWP provided a non\-judgemental, anonymous and inclusive e\-health service for students working in the sex industry. Responding to the needs of project members, services grew throughout the project’s lifetime to provide \(a\) sexual health information and a search engine to locate local services, \(b\) online peer\-led support through a moderated project members’ chat room, \(c\) online one\-to\-one confidential counselling with a sexologist and \(d\) safety advice provided by an experienced outreach worker through netreach. According to one student sex worker project member, “I used the website a lot at first when I was sorting my safety out. The Netreach was really great. I was able to get help and I also used the forum and the sexual health pages for basic info”* **\[C1\]**. Further, after receiving safety advice and support from the project, the member stated, *“I am safe now. I am no longer being taken advantage of by a client I couldn’t control. I think maybe he would have eventually killed me if I hadn’t got help from the project…”* **\[C1\]**. The online facilities offered the space for the development of trustful relationships, befriending and peer support impacting directly on project members: *“I don’t feel ashamed and I can be honest with the project and that keeps me safe and it makes me happier as I feel like my voice is being heard and taken seriously”* **\[C1\]**. 

 <ins>I</ins><ins>mprov</ins><ins>ing the responsiveness of established service providers to stud</ins><ins>ent sex worker</ins><ins> *s*</ins><ins>.</ins> Solutions to the obstacles of sex workers accessing services and the need for non\-judgemental service provision \(identified by Sagar and Jones in **\[R1\]** and **\[R2\]**\) were addressed through the project’s sex worker researchers working directly alongside the project sexual health partners, namely the NHS and THT. For the NHS, the first sexual health clinic for student sex workers was set up in the Cardiff and Vale Health Board area. This led to the development of the first outreach service to off\-street establishments in Cardiff, reaching student sex workers who worked indoors and, in doing so, improving the quality and diversity of sexual health services **\[C1\]**.  Additionally, THT were able for the first time to “ *consider the needs of sex workers more fully and to be more open to asking questions about sex work when conducting assessments* \[with service users\]”, with the aim of enhancing equality in service provision and stronger organisational support and advice for sex workers **\[C2\]**. 

 Sagar and Jones’ research **\[R1, R2, R3\]** enabled Public Health Wales to provide evidence regarding *“students’ views on and understanding of sexual health related needs and risks”* **\[C3\]** for the 2017/2018 Sexual Health Review for Wales. This review is particularly concerned with reducing inequalities in Wales through improving sexual health service provision and access to that provision. 

 **4.2 The enhancement of student sex workers’ well\-being through awareness\-raising and policy change within the student body 

 <ins>Breaking down s</ins><ins>tigma</ins><ins>.</ins> Engaging with the wider student body on the negative impacts of stigma on student sex workers was ongoing throughout the lifetime of the project. Project workers attended 30 Fresher’s Fayres in Wales over three years. Part of this interaction included the sharing of the project’s key findings on the psychological impact and social isolation which student sex workers attribute to stigmatisation. 1687 students then completed a short questionnaire: 86% indicated they were more aware of the stigma sex workers can face and 90% indicated that they would be more likely to challenge stigma against sex workers at their respective universities **\[C2\]**. This knowledge exchange encouraged the social inclusion of isolated sex workers: “ *Stigma takes a long time to break down but \[the project\] certainly had an impact. There is more awareness now and conversations take place. I definitely feel there is more acceptance, at least at \[my university\]’’* **\[C1\]**. 

 <ins>N</ins><ins>US</ins><ins>:</ins> <ins>policy</ins> <ins>d</ins><ins>evelopment</ins><ins>.</ins> The NUS were at the forefront of TSSWP research activities. Representatives from across the UK \(including NUS Scotland, NUS England, NUS Wales\) took part in annual policy group meetings hosted by the project **\[C2\]**.  This was the first time that the NUS had engaged in discussions on issues pertaining to student sex work and this led directly to changes in NUS policy. The Women’s Officer at NUS Cymru at the time said that the project *: ""has been invaluable for NUS' understanding of student sex work in UK higher education institutions. We now have evidence indicating the proportion of students who engage in sex work, the types of sex work students are more likely to do and crucially, how best they can be supported to succeed in HE. The report's recommendations have been taken up in our policy and campaigning work, including how we should tackle the prejudices and stigma that still exist in HE""* **\[C4\].** 

 In 2016, the issue of student sex work became a key aspect of NUS advocacy work and, with the support of Jones and Sagar, the NUS produced its own public scholarship report, which drew directly on the findings and recommendations of the TSSWP. The report called for HE and NUS staff to receive training to support student sex workers: “ *As The Student Sex Worker Project recommends \- a basic level of training should be given to all staff in further and higher education institutions and students unions on sex work so they do not discriminate and stigmatise student sex workers who disclose. Training should cover…diversity of occupations within the sex industry…\[S\]tereotyping and stigma…\[T\]he needs of student sex workers...*” **\[C5 p.26\]**. 

 Sagar and Jones’ research has assisted local NUS organisations to establish policies and processes. For example, the Vice President of Kent University’s Student Union stated in 2019: “ *Policy development was a key recommendation of TSSWP’s research report and I \(and other key staff\) recognised the need to establish a policy around processes in place if a student discloses working in the sex industry for staff and ensuring students do not face discipline but rather supported*”. Further, *“\[T\]he impact of TSSWP’s findings and wider public engagement tools has undoubtedly re\-shaped the approach to student sex work at Kent. Also, importantly, with the help of Tracey and Debbie we have been able to fulfil important NUS objectives – to reduce the stigma associated with sex work and to provide non\-judgemental services*” **\[C6\]**. 

 **4.3 The empowerment of student sex workers through the inclusion of their voices in public dissemination and debate, film, and the training of professionals** 

 <ins>Raising awareness about well\-being needs</ins> <ins>through publ</ins><ins>ic</ins> <ins>engagement and dissemination</ins><ins>.</ins> The project’s public engagement endeavours were specifically designed to bring the hidden voices of student sex workers into public debates and the service development/delivery arena. In this way, the project contributed to a wider public and professional understanding of basic standards of student sex workers’ well\-being, *from the perspectives of student sex workers themselves*.  The project’s strategy of reaching out to the public through print and online media to encourage thinking about and understanding of students’ involvement in the sex industry resulted in widespread interest in the topic, as evidenced by 71 instances of international coverage spread over 5 continents, with the research reported in 23 countries situated in Europe; South, East and North Asia; North America/Central North America; Australasia; South, East and West Africa\) **\[C7\]**. 

 The testimonies of student sex workers were narrated in a documentary, the 2015 *BAFTA Cymru* winning film ‘Fog of Sex’ **\[R5\]**, which also won The Celtic Media Festival’s *Best Film for Young People* in 2016. The films de\-mystify who is a sex worker and the consequences of stereotyping and stigma from the perspectives of student sex workers themselves. Public screenings of the film with question\-and\-answer sessions, led by Sagar and Jones, were held in Welsh Universities, public entertainment venues and science festivals/events, namely the Hay festival, Cheltenham Science Festival and the British Science Festival. According to leading sex work experts, Sanders and Campbell, **“**This has gone a significant way to reaching out to the general public and audiences beyond the Higher Education setting to flag up the complexities of sex work, the motivations of young people entering the sex industry whilst studying and dispels some of the stereotypes commonly associated with sex work.  The film will have continued impact leaving in place a resource for engagement with a wide range of audiences…*” **\[C1\]**. Since then, the film has been broadcast on the Community Channel in 2016 with over 50,000 viewings and on BBC3’s *Gender Season* since 2015 with over 1,000,000 viewings. The BBC produced ‘Student Sex Workers – Turning Fetishes into Finance’, a five\-episode series of short films with testimonies **\[R6\]** taken directly from the research, which was screened on BBC3 Online and You Tube with more than **17,800,266 viewings**. 

 <ins>Empowering</ins> <ins>student</ins> <ins>sex workers through self\-representation</ins> <ins>in</ins> <ins>film</ins><ins>.</ins> Through the films, student sex worker voices entered the public arena to directly challenge the stigma that keeps them socially excluded and vulnerable. The creative research and dissemination process had a strong personal impact on those whose stories the films are based on. One sex worker wrote, *“\[Taking part in the film\] has been a really important and life\-changing part of my life. I still think about it a lot. It empowered me to start making some changes. I felt like my story wasn’t dramatized or made more interesting or more to fit in with what the project wanted to portray. That made me feel my story was important as it was. \[…\] The film gave me a voice when I never had one before. This has been massively empowering for me’’* **\[C8\]**. 

 <ins>Empowering student sex workers</ins> <ins>th</ins><ins>r</ins><ins>ough</ins> <ins>co\-produced</ins> <ins>training</ins><ins>.</ins> The research results **\[R1**, **R2**, **R3\]** were used to develop the first online training tool to promote professional understanding about student sex work among HE staff/support services/practitioners who have contact with students. The training was co\-produced with student sex worker project members and project partners to raise awareness about stigma and its negative impact on students engaged in the sex industry. Importantly, it focuses on issues that student sex workers want those who work in HE/support services to have a better understanding of. As one student sex worker explained, *“Looking at the future, I know that my* *involvement in the project has already had a large impact. For example, the video diaries I made while taking part in* *the production of the film are being used as part of the training with charities, public health organisations, or people from the police”* **\[C8\]**. The training launched in June 2019 and, to date, it has been taken up by approximately 100 professionals across the UK \(for example, in HEIs, NUS, NHS and the police\). It has also been incorporated into a national toolkit under development at Leicester University. According to the NUS Vice President at Kent University, *“The online training developed by Debbie and Tracey has also been a fantastic tool which has increased our knowledge and understanding on a range of important issues \(in particular tackling stereotypes and how to address a disclosure\) and it has helped us to understand what is important to student sex workers themselves”* **\[C6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Illingworth’s *Lesions in the Landscape* examined the complex individual and societal impact of amnesia, a condition in which the capacity to retrieve and form memory is eroded and the past is effectively erased. The project artworks, which included two large\-scale immersive video and sound installations, a film, and a curated exhibition, raised public awareness of key issues relating to amnesia in a highly accessible, thought\-provoking, and engaging way. The project reached wide and diverse audiences and contributed to the long\-term development of a number of organisations in the creative arts. It supported and sustained innovation, and influenced these organisations’ approaches to delivering cutting\-edge programming. It informed significant scientific and clinical learning and, through its innovative interdisciplinary approach, stimulated new insights into the ways that technology can be used to improve the lives of people dealing with amnesia or early\-stage dementia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 *Lesions in the Landscape \(Lesions\)* is a multifaceted research project with outputs including two large\-scale video and sound installations, *Lesions in the Landscape* \(2015\) **\[R1\]** and *Time Present* \(2016\) **\[R3\]**; the film *Searching* \(2016\) **\[R4\],** and the exhibition *The Amnesia Museum* \(2015\) **\[R2\]**. The project was a collaboration between artist\-filmmaker Shona Illingworth \(University of Kent\), neuropsychologists Martin A. Conway \(City University\) and Catherine Loveday \(University of Westminster\); and Claire \(expert by experience\). *Lesions* *in the Landscape* was supported by several awards, including a Large Arts Award from the Wellcome Trust \(2013\-15\) **\[G1\]**. Its creative outputs contributed to Illingworth’s nomination for the 2016 Jarman Award. 

 *Lesions* explored the devastating effects of amnesia on Claire and its parallels in the permanent evacuation of the inhabitants of the remote Scottish archipelago, St Kilda, in 1930. Illingworth’s hypothesis was that, in both individual and cultural amnesia, accessing or reconstructing the past is a difficult and isolating process, that this past is predominantly constructed by others, and that this has a significant impact on how the future can be imagined, and by whom. Illingworth explored this hypothesis collaboratively with Claire: using investigative drawing, through images taken with Sensecam – a sensory\-operated wearable camera, developed by Microsoft – and by undertaking extensive fieldwork. The fieldwork included a period of filming on St Kilda, through which Illingworth established a collection of data in the form of video, film, sound recording, data sonification, photographs, sculptures, amnesia mappings, and interviews. Neuropsychologists Loveday and Conway also used EEG to record Claire’s neurological activity as she viewed Sensecam images searching for visual cues to activate her memory. This research collaboration provided insight into the use of new and emerging technologies to aid memory and resulted in the development of new ways to articulate the experience of living with amnesia. It also shaped the art, science, and public engagement outcomes of the project. 

 As part of the research process, Illingworth developed a series of interdisciplinary forums.    Amnesia Lab was held in Australia in 2014, and the Amnesia Forums were held in London, the Outer Hebrides, and Liverpool between 2014 and 2016. These provided a space for artists, scientists, geographers, anthropologists, writers and curators to explore how art practice, sound, and immersive media can advance understanding of memory, amnesia and cultural erasure. These interdisciplinary dialogues, along with the fieldwork and EEG studies, directly informed Illingworth’s practice\-research\-based enquiries and the project outputs. 

 *Lesions in the Landscape* premiered in 2015 at FACT, Liverpool. It comprises a large\-scale, immersive three\-screen video and sound installation, incorporating voice, engineered and ambient sounds **\[R1\]**. *Time Present* **,** a two\-screen video and sound installation that explores Claire’s experience of memory loss, was exhibited at the Wellcome Collection, London as part at their 2016 *States of Mind* exhibition **\[R3\]**. *Searching,* which focused on the project’s scientific insight *,* was commissioned by Channel 4 and Film London, and was broadcast on Channel 4 in 2017 and exhibited at the Whitechapel Gallery, London **\[R4\]**. Illingworth’s *The Amnesia Museum* \(2015\) toured widely alongside *Lesions in the Landscape* and drew together her films, photography, sculptures, drawings, and documents, as well as a 32\-speaker sonification of an EEG of Claire’s, brain activity **\[R2\]**. The project marked new territory in employing artistic practice alongside pioneering neuropsychological research to significantly enhance understandings of individual and cultural amnesia. Through its interdisciplinary approach, *Lesions in the Landscape* has developed new insights into ways of conceptualising the complex condition of amnesia and memory loss and its wide\-ranging consequences.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Enhancing public understanding of memory loss, amnesia and neuropsychological research by engaging extensive and diverse audiences.** 

 An independent evaluation for the Wellcome Trust confirmed that *Lesions in the Landscape* \( *Lesions*\) ‘raised public awareness of key issues relating to amnesia in a highly accessible, thought provoking but engaging way. The concepts that it communicated were incredibly complex, yet it reached wide audiences, many of whom were significantly, emotionally affected by the work’ **\[a\]**. These audiences were reached through national and international exhibitions, as well as extensive coverage across television, radio, and both popular and specialist press. *Lesions, Time Present, Searching,* and the *Amnesia Museum* **\[R1\-R4\]** were seen by audiences in excess of 240,000 at FACT, Liverpool \(2015\), UNSW Galleries, Sydney \(2016\), CGP Gallery, London \(2016\), Taigh Chearsabhagh, Outer Hebrides \(2016\), Wellcome Collection, London \(2017\), Sayle Gallery, Isle of Man \(2017\), Whitechapel Gallery, London \(2017\), and the Film Focus Festival, Orkney \(2018\). *Searching* was watched by 86,000 households when it was broadcast on Channel 4 in 2017 **\[a\]**. The research and the exhibitions were both widely discussed in the media and in a number of in\-depth interviews: on television and radio \(including BBC News Online, BBC Radio Scotland, ABC Australia\); in the broadsheet press \(including the *National*, the *Australian*, the *Scotsman*, the *Guardian*\); in art press \(including *Hyperallergic*, *Cult Frame*, *The Museums Journal*, *Art Monthly*, *Studio International*, *Aesthetica*\); and in specialist and popular science press \(including the *Lancet*, the *Psychologist*, and Radio 4's *All in the Mind*\) **\[a\]**. Through these avenues, Illingworth made accessible a neuropsychological understanding of the dynamic relationship between memory and imagination, and the consequences this can have for those living with amnesia and memory loss. 

 Audiences engaged with the research in ways that were innovative and actively inclusive: via presentations – at the Whitechapel Gallery, London; Medical Museum, Copenhagen; and the Aurora Museum, Shanghai – as well as through an extensive programme of events across all the exhibition venues **\[a\]**. *Lesions* was produced by, and first exhibited at, FACT, a Liverpool\-based arts organisation at the forefront of technology, film and new media. Roger McKinley, the Head of R&I, described how, ‘inspired by the wealth of Shona’s work’, they ‘experimented with \[ *Lesions*\] as an education programme’ **\[a\]**. This programme focused on engaging under\-represented audiences across Liverpool and reached 821 participants. It included training events for secondary\-school Geography and Psychology teachers, as well as workshops for young people exploring Minecraft as a space for social memory and co\-design **\[a**\]. In FACT’s Digital Ambassador’s creative and digital education programme for older adults, *Lesions* was used as a *‘*catapult for wider discussions’ within STEAM \(Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths\) workshops **\[a\]**.  According to an evaluation by FACT, this ‘broadened \[the participants’\] mindsets, provided a toolkit for stimulating conversations and sparked an interest in topics they may not have approached otherwise’ **\[d\]**. Also at FACT, 60 individuals with moderate dementia engaged with *Lesions* through the ‘Visual Matrix’ evaluative tool. Results showed that, when directly engaging with artwork content, individuals were able to discuss and express their experience of memory loss with others. This response was described in the programme evaluation as ‘a revelation *’* **\[a\]**. At Taigh Chearsabhagh – a museum, visual arts centre, and vital community hub in North Uist in the Outer Hebrides – the public and education programme that was developed around *Lesions* brought together over 140 people with dementia, their carers, and others in the community **\[b\]**. This encouraged discussion around ageing, loss, memory, place, and community that enhanced ‘dialogue and partnership with the older people on the islands’, and ‘certainly raised awareness for us as an organisation, and I think generally, of the profile of memory loss dementia/alzheimers as an issue in the islands’ **\[f\]**. For members of FACT’s Senior Art School, a critical art school for people over 60, *Lesions* also opened up discussions about memory loss. Members reported that ‘with Shona’s \[work\] it was particularly interesting, because of the amnesia content, there were people who were dealing with this – them, their friends etc.  They came at it from a completely different angle and really engaged with it \[…\]. There was a real impact *’* **\[a\]**. 

 **Generating new approaches, enhancing skills and influencing programming in arts organisations** 

 Producing and hosting *Lesions*, a complex and technically demanding exhibition, delivered long\-term benefits for the two regional arts centres with which Illingworth collaborated closely, FACT Liverpool and Taigh Chearsabhagh. The Arts Curator at Taigh Chearsabhagh, Andy Mackinnon, described how the collaboration with Illingworth ‘opened \[them\] up to a museological approach within its subsequent contemporary art programming’; ‘vastly increased knowledge around multi\-channel video installations’; built new skills within the team; and created the capacity and the ambition to deliver further innovative programmes **\[f\]**. This enhanced skills base led Taigh Chearsabhagh to commission new work by international moving\-image artists, Mairead Maclean, Joshua Bonnetta, Amund Bentsen and Benjamin Skop, ‘leading to peer recognition of our \[Taigh Chearsabhagh’s\] work in this field’ **\[f\]**. Mackinnon also cites *Lesions* as a direct inspiration for the FAODAIL|FOUND Outer Hebrides Archive Film project, which digitises and disseminates indigenous home movie footage. This film footage, shown at Taigh Chearsabhagh, has ensured a more accurate representation of island life and has also been used in care homes to help promote reminiscence sessions with residents with dementia **\[f\]**. Mackinnon reports, more generally, that the collaboration with Illingworth ‘reassured our main funder, Creative Scotland, of our determination and capability in programming high quality work which is reflected in their continued and increased support of the organisation’ **\[f\]**. 

 *Lesions* was described by FACT as ‘probably \[…\] the most successful exhibition put on’ **\[a\]**. This successful collaboration with Illingworth significantly influenced the development of FACT: it enabled the organisation to ‘become truly interdisciplinary’ by integrating its research and public programmes; it helped \[FACT\] transition to a much clearer vision and targets; it influenced the establishment and development of the Research and Innovation Department; and it led to the adoption of new approaches to programming and evaluation **\[a, e\]**. Illingworth’s use of creative methods to translate complex subjects and multiple perspectives \(via Amnesia Forums\) informed the development of FACTLab, an interactive, creative workshop space for collaboration between learning development work, the creative industries, and HEI partners. ‘Directly inspired by Shona’s Amnesia Forums’, FACTLAB ran a series of 12 reading groups with artist and technologists that fed into the 2017 New Observatory exhibition and related publications \(part of a collaboration with the Open Data Institute\) **\[e\]**. Illingworth also worked with FACT to deploy a novel evaluation technique, the ‘Visual Matrix’ \(developed by Professor Lynn Froggett at UCLAN\). The Head of R&I reported that this work ‘has been a strong contributor to how \[FACT\] now evaluate and measure the impact of the artworks we commission and the affect it has on our audiences’.  He attributes this to ‘Shona’s support for using the new techniques in an art gallery’, which ‘enabled the ‘Visual Matrix’ to be tested in vivo with a “live” audience.’  **\[e\]**. In the production of the sound component of *Lesions*, Illingworth also worked closely with Kinicho, an innovative spatial audio start\-up, whose work on a new 3D audio tool was developed as part of the final artwork and installation. After *Lesions*, FACT continued to work directly with Kinicho and the collaboration with Illingworth was cited directly in a successful £5 milion ERDF bid to support a creative industry cluster in the Liverpool City Region. The cluster ran for two years from 2016 and brought £120,000 of new funds directly into FACT **\[e\]**. *Lesions* also offered Kinicho a proof\-of\-concept case study, which they have used to showcase their systems and their pioneering approach to prospective clients **\[a\]**. 

 **Informing scientific and clinical understanding of the lived experience of amnesia and providing insight into the use of sensory operated cameras as a memory aid** 

 Jill Bennett, Director of the Australian National Institute for Experimental Arts and of Sydney’s Big Anxiety Festival, writes that: ‘ *Lesions in the Landscape* has been an immensely influential project. It is one of the most far\-reaching arts\-science collaborations to date with multiple outcomes in both arts and science outlets’ **\[g\]**. *Lesions* has informed clinical pedagogy and practice; stimulated debate among scientists and clinicians; challenged and developed pre\-existing knowledge; and initiated new international research studies and networks **\[a, g, i\].** Martin Conway, Professor of Cognitive Neuropsychology and specialist in autobiographical memory, attributes his improved understanding of the lived experience of amnesia to his collaboration with Illingworth on *Lesions* **\[i\]**. He communicated this enhanced understanding to over 600 researchers and clinicians ‘to massive impact’ when he showed and discussed Illingworth’s *Searching* at the 2016 International Conference on Memory **\[i\]**. Catherine Loveday, also a Professor of Neuropsychology, said ‘she had learned more about amnesia during her involvement with Illingworth’s work than she had in 20 years of clinical and scientific work’ **\[c\]**. She noted that Illingworth’s artistic approach to working with Claire ‘changed the way I work with Claire clinically’ **\[c\]**. She further recognises the impact this has had on her wider practice: ‘there is no question that Shona’s work has influenced my interaction with patients. At a very basic level I simply have a better understanding of the lived experience, which makes me a better clinician and a more discerning academic. At a more practical level, I now avoid asking patients to put memories in a traditional timeline, recognising that this is not always helpful. I also work with patients to find tasks that engage them in the present moment, freeing them from the potential unease that is created when they are left to mind\-wander with a system that is not capable of doing so’ **\[h\]**. This improved understanding has directly influenced clinical pedagogy and student thinking. Loveday teaches on both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in Cognitive Neuroscience and Cognitive Rehabilitation. Through this ‘there are now at least 4 cohorts of students who will go out into the clinical world with a greater understanding of the lived experience of amnesia, both as a result of my direct teaching and from interacting with Shona’s work’ **\[h\]**. 

 Multiple scientific outcomes have emerged from *Lesions in the Landscape*. An Australian Research Council\-funded Discovery Project \( *Mnemoscape*\) drew on *Lesions* in the formative development of *Edge of the Present,* an immersive VR environment that was exhibited at the 2019 *Big Anxiety Festival* in Sydney. Since May 2020, *Edge of the Present* has formed a key part of a suicide prevention project funded by Suicide Prevention Australia. Bennett links this ‘directly back to \[Illingworth’s\] *Amnesia Lab* and the subsequent work around *Lesions* in Australia’ **\[g\]**. The knowledge accrued through *Lesions* has also informed scientific understanding and opened up new avenues for neuroscientific discourse about the lived experience of amnesia and how wearable sensory\-operated cameras \(such as Sensecam\) can improve memory in amnesic patients. The week\-long filming of *Lesions* on St Kilda provided Loveday with a unique opportunity to observe Claire using Sensecam. This directly informed the experimental protocol for the EEG study, conducted by Loveday and Conway, which recorded and analysed Claire’s neurological activity while she viewed the photographs that she had taken using the camera **\[a\]**. Specifically, it gave them new insights into the role of the imagination in memory loss, ‘in ways that would have been unlikely with a traditional scientific approach’ **\[a\]**. Lesions also provided ‘a large amount of pilot data and insight’ for the study, saving ‘two years of standard developmental pilot tests in the lab’ **\[a\]**. The collaborative research and the EEG study together demonstrated an important difference between the memory loss experienced by Claire \(due to amnesia\) and that of a patient experiencing memory loss due to early\-onset Alzheimer’s **\[h\]**. By contributing to the clinical understanding of memory\-making and continuity, *Lesions* also provided ‘extraordinary insight’ into how technology, and in particular Sensecam, can be utilised to aid people with early\-stage dementia **\[a\]**. Conway noted that *‘Lesions in the Landscape* was at the forefront of making people aware’ of Sensecam’s therapeutic effects and benefits **\[i\].** Bennett describes how these new insights informed the development and evaluation of an immersive 3D browser for Senscam, commenting that this development ‘emerged directly from our work with Claire, the main collaborator in Lesions \[…\] and is evidence of how the field of memory loss/impairment has opened up as a result of this ground\-breaking art\-science collaboration’ **\[g\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Queen Mary’s Action on Salt team has been instrumental in influencing the government to implement a structured and highly cost\-effective salt reduction programme. More than one in four adults in the UK have high blood pressure; over half of the disease burden ascribed to high blood pressure — including cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death in the UK — is due to chronic excess salt consumption, with average salt intake in the UK being 40% higher than the recommended maximum. As a result of Queen Mary’s work, the Department of Health set new voluntary salt targets in 2014 for industry to achieve by 2017. Industry analysis by Public Health England in 2018 also showed that 81% of food products consumed in the home fell within 2017 salt targets, with 71% of out\-of\-home food products meeting maximum per\-serving targets — achievements driven by Action on Salt, which has continually maintained pressure on the food industry, and kept salt on the agenda. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with around half of this disease burden being due to chronic excess salt consumption. Average salt intakes in the UK are currently 40% higher than the recommended maximum of 6g per day. 

 The Action on Salt research group, chaired by MacGregor and based at Queen Mary’s Wolfson Institute, has extensively demonstrated the relationship between salt intake and blood pressure. In a meta\-analysis of 34 trials, the group showed that a modest longer\-term reduction in salt intake, as per current health recommendations, brings a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in blood pressure in both those with and without high blood pressure, irrespective of sex or ethnic group. This meta\-analysis also demonstrated a dose\-response relationship between reduction in salt intake and fall in systolic blood pressure, and indicated that a further reduced salt intake of 3g per day \(in addition to the current 6g recommendations\) would have a major effect on health \[3.1\]. 

 Based on the above findings, the group developed a salt reduction model to guide development of a voluntary salt reduction policy in the UK \(Figure 1\) \[3.2\]. This was subsequently adopted by the Food Standards Agency \(FSA\), which was given responsibility for nutrition policy following its formation in 2000. 

 Figure 1: 



 As part of this voluntary policy, the FSA tasked Action on Salt with holding the food industry to account on their salt reduction progress, which they did by, inter alia, studying the main contributors of salt to the average UK diet, including: 

-  Bread, the leading contributor, which saw a 20% average reduction in salt content between 2001 and 2011 \[3.3\] 

-  Cheese, for which salt content was high but there was significant variation within the same type of cheese, highlighting the possibility of reformulation \[3.4\] 

-  Breakfast cereals, for which average salt content had decreased by 47% between the early 1990s and 2015 \[3.5\]. 

#  Evaluating the Government’s salt reduction policy 

 In 2014, Action on Salt investigated the impact of the UK government’s salt reduction policy on blood pressure, stroke and ischaemic heart disease mortality, using data from the National Diet and Nutrition and Health Surveys for England. They showed that a reduction in daily salt intake \(of 1.4 grams between 2003 and 2011\) caused population blood pressure to fall \(by 3.0±0.33/1.4±0.20 mm Hg – a reduction of 2.3%/1.9%\), in turn reducing incidence of mortality from stroke and heart disease \(for which there were decreases of 42% and 40%, respectively, across the same period\) \[3.6\]. 

 Following the government’s decision to move nutrition policy responsibility from the FSA to the Department of Health and their Public Health Responsibility Deal \(PHRD\), MacGregor and colleagues published a 2015 article in the British Medical Journal \[3.7\] highlighting concerns about the UK’s salt reduction programme. The article noted that the decision led to delays in salt reduction targets being reset, accompanied by a lack of official monitoring of food industry progress as the PHRD made the industry responsible for reporting its own progress. MacGregor and colleagues estimated that a delay in resetting salt targets effectively resulted in four years of the programme being lost, corresponding to approximately 6,000 deaths from stroke and heart attack — 4,000 of which were premature and preventable. As a result of the 2015 General Election, the PHRD was dissolved. Due in part to Action on Salt’s lobbying, Public Health England \(PHE\) was given responsibility for the salt reduction targets in 2017.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Salt reduction is recommended by the WHO as a ‘best buy’ intervention to prevent death and disability from non\-communicable diseases due to its feasibility and cost effectiveness \[5.1\]. For every GBP1 spent on salt reduction in the UK, GBP300 is saved in healthcare costs \[5.2\]. Led by MacGregor, Queen Mary’s Action on Salt is heavily involved in the development and implementation of the UK’s salt reduction policy, and the only UK non\-governmental expert group to visibly and consistently highlight the need for salt reduction. 

#  Influencing the UK’s salt reduction policy 

 Based on Action on Salt’s salt reduction model, summarised in Figure 1, the UK Government implemented a multifaceted salt reduction programme. In 2014, the Department of Health set new voluntary salt targets for industry to achieve, following numerous meetings with members of the food industry and Action on Salt \(as an independent monitor\) \[5.3\]. 

 In 2015, when it was evident that the Department of Health’s voluntary Public Health Responsibility Deal was not working successfully, MacGregor and colleagues published criticism in the British Medical Journal and via press releases \[3.7\]. Action on Salt maintained pressure and kept salt on the agenda, resulting in PHE taking responsibility for salt reduction \[5.4\]. Due in large part to Action on Salt’s lobbying, salt was mentioned as a priority in the Secretary of State for Health’s Prevention Green Paper \[5.5\] 

 Action on Salt also worked with the Chief Medical Officer’s \(CMO\) team to ensure that salt reduction was mentioned in the CMO Annual Report for 2018 \[5.6\]. Following this, in February 2020, PHE released a closed consultation on their new salt reduction targets for 2020–2024 to key stakeholders, including Action on Salt \[5.7\]. 

#  Reducing salt content in food 

 Action on Salt has worked to stimulate the food industry to reformulate products by publicly highlighting poor performance. PHE’s analysis of the industry’s progress towards the 2017 salt reduction targets found that 81% of foods consumed in\-home \(retailer own label and manufacturer\-branded products\) met maximum salt targets, and just over half met average targets. For the out\-of\-home sector, 71% of products met maximum per\-serving targets \[5.8\]. A Queen Mary health economics analysis showed that the 2003\-2018 salt reduction programme in England achieved a reduction in salt intake of 1g/day/adult from 9.38g/day in 2000 to 8.38g/day in 2018. Compared with a scenario of persistent 2000 levels, assuming that the population\-level salt intake is maintained at 2018 values, by 2050 the programme will have avoided 83,100 premature deaths due to heart disease and 110,700 premature strokes, generating 542,900 extra quality\-adjusted life\-years and GBP1,640,000,000 healthcare cost savings for the adult population of England \[5.9\]. 

#  Raised awareness and industry support for Action on Salt’s annual Salt Awareness Week 

 Each year, Action on Salt organises a national 'Salt Awareness Week' to raise awareness of the damaging effect of excess salt on public health. The annual campaign enables Action on Salt to directly engage key stakeholders. Posters, leaflets and factsheets are made available for order by hospitals, GP surgeries, health charities, schools, universities and the food industry. In 2019, there were more than 300 supporting events throughout the UK. Salt Awareness Week has increased public awareness, as evidenced by the FSA’s Public Attitudes Tracker, which continues to highlight salt as a top concern for consumers \[5.10\]. Additionally, Action on Salt has gained support for their annual Awareness Week from multiple food companies, which have committed to further salt reduction work. Following their continued involvement in the Awareness Week, McCain, Waitrose, Aldi, the Co\-op and Mars Food had met most of the 2017 salt reduction targets \[5.11\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 University of Bristol research into mid\-air haptic feedback technology led to the creation of the highly successful spin\-out company Ultraleap \(formerly Ultrahaptics\). Ultraleap now employs 170 people, has raised GBP65 million in investment, and acquired a US company in 2019 to expand their portfolio of technologies. Sales of over 1,000 development kits have led to the incorporation of their haptic technology into applications and products in the home, automotive, industrial and digital fields with partners including Microsoft, Coca Cola, Bosch and global market leader in digital signage BrightSign. Commercially available products include a vehicle, digital signage and VR gaming technology. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Haptic feedback is to the sense of touch what visual feedback is to sight, and audio feedback is to hearing. The development of touch screens enables digital interaction using a greater range of gestures and motion but, without haptic feedback, the user retains a reliance on visual cues to know whether an action has been completed. The University of Bristol’s Interaction and Graphics Research Group have conducted research on advanced user interaction modalities since 2009. Initial research by Subramanian and Fraser, funded by EPSRC \[i\], focussed on new forms of displays and devices that enhance the way a user interacts with computational devices, showing the limitations of touchless interaction \[1\]. 

 Working to incorporate haptic feedback into touchless interactions, the team focussed on the use of ultrasound\-based air pressure waves to produce tactile sensations in mid\-air. Mid\-air, touchless haptics bring significant benefits to users, including avoiding having to physically touch an object or surface, with obvious public health benefits, and being able to position a touchless interface right next to a user, with safety and convenience benefits in situations such as in\-car interfaces or in interactive signage. Existing techniques had shown that an array of ultrasound transmitters could create tactile sensations in mid\-air at a single focal point but had no ability to create multiple focal points simultaneously due to interference issues. 

 These issues of interference were subsequently solved by Subramanian’s team, in collaboration with Drinkwater from Mechanical Engineering, who investigated novel approaches to multi\-point and mid\-air haptic feedback and introduced a system they called *UltraHaptics* \[2\]. This research, supported by ERC funding \[ii\], proposed a solution using a novel waveform synthesis algorithm that provided far greater control over the pressure distribution created by arrays of ultrasound emitters than existing techniques, and was thus capable of creating multiple simultaneous focal points and controlling them individually \(Figure 1a\). 

 The hardware was also extremely scalable, comfortably extending from small arrays \(4x4 transducers\) to setups featuring multiple large arrays \(20x20 and beyond\). It also scaled from computationally intensive applications requiring a powerful PC down to embedded systems.

 Figure 1 \- \(a\) the UltraHaptics system that employs focused ultrasound to project discrete points of haptic feedback through the display and directly on to users’ unadorned hands; \(b\) system set up for the creation and testing of 3D haptic shapes. 


 Follow up research considered how to produce convincing sensations of motion, as well as how users perceive a static point. Using the *UltraHaptics* system, the University of Bristol team \(funded by EPSRC \[iii\]\), showed the minimum shape size required to perceive a point, the minimum distance to perceive motion \[3\], and demonstrated the ability of the system to manipulate physical objects in a vertical plane \[4\]. This research resulted in novel hardware with much greater directionality than conventional emitter arrays, enabling the creation of pressure patterns in a larger volume of air with a smaller array. 

 To enable a user to feel a three\-dimensional object and provide a more realistic experience, the group developed an algorithm that could control the volumetric distribution of the acoustic radiation force field when using a two\-dimensional phased ultrasound array \[5\]. This enabled the production of a volumetric haptic shape in mid\-air, but was also capable of running interactively, allowing the creation of real\-time haptic sensations and dynamically changing shapes. The capability to create mid\-air haptic shapes is advantageous as a user does not need to wear any attachments or be restricted by the use of any tools \(Figure 1b\). 

 Development of a working prototype using EPSRC Impact Acceleration funds enabled the physical demonstration of the technology, and the exploration of applications and market segments. Patent applications were filed by the University of Bristol in 2013 and 2014 on the method for producing an acoustic field, the method for providing tactile sensations, and on modulating haptic feedback \[6\]. These patent applications were licensed \(and subsequently assigned\) to the newly created company, Ultrahaptics \(now Ultraleap\), set up by Carter, Subramanian and Long to commercially exploit the results of the research.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

#  Commercialisation of new technology 

 Ultrahaptics Limited was formed in November 2013 to commercialise technology that provides mid\-air haptic feedback. The technology stemmed directly from research undertaken at the University of Bristol \[1\-5\], which was the basis for patents and other intellectual property rights \(including \[6\]\) licensed to Ultrahaptics. The license included know\-how related to the patent applications such as algorithms \[2, 5\], methods for integrating the haptic feedback mechanism into commercial products \[3, 6\], as well as software developed to control, evaluate and simulate an array of ultrasound transducers. The licensed rights have formed the basis of continued research within the company, being cited in subsequent company patent applications \[A\]. 

 Ultraleaps’ forecast sales revenue for 2020 is GBP4.5 million, chiefly from licenses to AR/VR companies, touchless interfaces, and sales of development kits \[A\]. Ultraleap now employs 170 people, including 140 in Bristol and 30 in Silicon Valley. Twelve of these employees came from Leap Motion, a Silicon Valley\-based company focussed on advanced hand\-tracking technology which was acquired by Ultrahaptics in 2019, before rebranding as Ultraleap \[B\]. The workforce has 27 different nationalities and 35 PhD graduates. The company has raised GBP65 million in investment funding over four investment rounds. 

 The initial commercial offering was an evaluation kit which was sold to individual users and companies from late 2014. The kit allowed companies to evaluate the technology and develop concepts and prototypes for their own applications, and allowed Ultrahaptics to pursue development agreements with relevant partners. Within two weeks of launch, the team was expanded to handle the demand for kits. 

 Ultraleap now has two commercially available kits: *STRATOS Explore*, a flexible, scalable high\-end haptics development kit, and *STRATOS Inspire*, a complete haptic module. *Explore* allows developers to create immersive and interactive experiences but is not certified for public use, whereas *Inspire* can be used for interactive public installations. More than 1,000 kits have been sold across the world to large industrial companies as well as smaller development companies \[A\].

#  Development and partnerships 

 Using the evaluation kit as an entry point from 2014, development agreements were reached with companies across a range of sectors, resulting in prototypes, demonstrators, and commercially available products. These are outlined below. 

#  i\) Automotive 

 
 Bosch conceptual cockpit 

In 2017, Harman \(now owned by Samsung\), a long\-term BMW partner, incorporated Ultraleap’s mid\-air haptic technology to create a system of virtual buttons and knobs which can be closer to the driver than physical ones, as well as noiseless feedback warnings for lane departure, forward collision, and blind spot detection \[Ci\]. Similarly, Bosch presented a conceptual cockpit incorporating haptic feedback technology from Ultraleap \[Cii\]. 

 More recently, a partnership between Dimenco, BHTC and Ultraleap resulted in Simulated Reality displays for a fully natural, interactive in\-car centre console at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The Head of Technical Marketing & Technology Scouting at BHTC described the benefit of combining knowledge from the three companies *“….in a multimodal approach \- to address multiple senses in an HMI* \[human machine interface\] *\- makes traveling safe, comfortable, relaxing and fun. Driving becomes an experience.”* \[Di\]. In 2020, Ultraleap’s mid\-air haptic and hand\-tracking technology was incorporated into DS Automobile’s new concept vehicle to “… *eradicate the constraints of touchpads…Through Leap Motion and Ultrahaptics technologies, you make a hand gesture and receive a sensory answer.”* \[Dii\]. 

#  ii\) Virtual Reality \(VR\) gaming and visualisation 

 
 Interactive cinema signage 

Ultraleap’s mid\-air haptic and hand\-tracking technology has been integrated into Fallen Planet Studio’s technology \[Ei\] that is licensed by multiple VR arcades, including Inmotion VR \[Eii\], as well as directly into the VR experience industry such as The Void’s Star Wars experience \[Eiii\]. The CEO of Fallen Planet Studios explained that *“…by implementing Ultrahaptics’ mid\-air technology we are able to deepen that level of immersion to new levels, without saddling the user with additional hardware for them to navigate. This combines to create a compelling out\-of\-home experience that really has to be felt to be believed.”* \[Eii\]. 

 Ultraleap’s technology has also been incorporated into interactive displays: a collaboration between Dimenco, Microsoft and Ultraleap led to the demonstration of the world’s first interactive 8K 3D display at CES 2020 \[F\]. This display enables creators to build 3D designs in a fully spatial environment, without the need for headwear or other wearables, delivering a dramatic improvement in possibilities and overall immersive productivity. 

#  iii\) Digital signage and kiosks 

 In 2018, Ultraleap installed two interactive digital signage installations and one static installation in a top\-tier cinema complex in Los Angeles in order to quantify the impact of interactivity in digital out\-of\-home advertising \[Gi\]. The study showed an increase in attention time, brand awareness, dwell time, and conversion rate for the posters with haptic feedback which was corroborated by a further academic study \[H\]. This has led to multiple partnerships including with digital signage company BrightSign \[Gii\], the global market leader in digital signage media players, and with ZeroLight \[Giii\]. These have resulted in interactive digital exploration experiences at trade shows and in public spaces. 

 More companies have moved to self\-serve kiosks to reduce customer wait time and staff requirements, but concerns have been raised about the hygiene implications of a multi\-user touch screen, especially in light of the pandemic. In June 2020, CEN Media Group and Ultraleap signed a deal to install touchless technology incorporating haptic feedback at kiosks in their cinema network, starting with ten US city locations: “… *the installations will include Ultraleap’s hand tracking and mid\-air haptics which will limit the spread of germs and…provide safe and natural interaction with content.*..” \[I\]. 

 In October 2020 Ultraleap launched an application that can be used to rapidly retrofit kiosks and touchscreens to become touchless devices using hand tracking technology \[Ji\]. Ultraleap has signed a deal with Cortina Productions to roll the technology out across museums and exhibitions and complements their existing collaboration on mid\-air haptics. The Principal and Director of Development at Cortina Productions, said: *“Over the last few months we’ve seen a drastic spike in requests from clients for touchless solutions for their interactive exhibits. Our clients rely on us to be at the forefront of new technology and to deliver experiences that are engaging and innovative. Ultraleap’s technology not only helps us to provide the ‘wow factor’, it is completely touchless, making it the perfect solution to our clients’ requests.”* \[Jii\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Grounded in Liverpool’s dynamical systems research, a pioneering five\-year collaboration between Liverpool mathematicians and British composer Emily Howard has generated impacts on creativity, culture and society. Beneficiaries include Howard herself, as well as other composers, audiences \(live, radio, streaming\), concert venues, publishers, record labels and performing ensembles: 

 Seven musical works include commissions for BBC Proms and Sir Simon Rattle, live performances at the Royal Albert Hall and the Barbican Centre, as well as five broadcasts on BBC Radio 3. 

 Concerto for Orchestra hailed by *The Times* as ‘ *visionary*’ and recognised with a British Composer Award \(2017\). 

 Four published scores, plus two tracks released by record label NMC Recordings. 

 Lasting influence on artistic practice through a first\-of\-its\-kind centre for science and music \(PRiSM\).

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Lasse Rempe is Professor of Pure Mathematics in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Liverpool. Rempe researches **dynamical systems**, specifically the iteration of transcendental functions. In **\[3.1\]**, with Sebastian van Strien \(Imperial College London\) he established density of hyperbolicity for the famous Arnold family of circle maps. This family is a simple model for phase\-locking in a periodically forced oscillator that has been studied intensively since the 1960s. Density of hyperbolicity is a central question in one\-dimensional dynamics \(compare Smale’s 11th “problem for the next century”\). It states, informally, that through a small perturbation within the given family, any system can be changed into one exhibiting the simplest type of behaviour \(convergence to stable cycles\) – no matter how chaotically the original system behaves. The proof of this result for the Arnold family draws significantly on Rempe's earlier work **\[3.2\]** on the escaping set of transcendental entire functions; that is, the set of points where the iterates converge to infinity. In **\[3.2\]**, Rempe showed that, for a certain class of functions, the behaviour on this set is very rigid \- that is, it does not give rise to non\-trivial perturbations. The same holds for the complex extension of the Arnold family, with the same proof, and this fact plays a crucial role in **\[3.1\]**. This body of research was supported by funding from EPSRC \(EP/E017886/1, EP/E052851/1\) and the Leverhulme Trust \(Philip Leverhulme Prize 2012\), totalling GBP529,847. 

 There are four key reasons why Rempe’s proof in **\[3.1\]** provided fertile ground for developing new creative thinking in his collaboration with composer Emily Howard. Firstly, the result lends itself to expression in simple and general terms \(no matter how chaotic such a system, there is always stability nearby\). Secondly, phase\-locking is a phenomenon relevant to musicians – from the synchronisation of linked metronomes to the elimination of non\-harmonic overtones through the bowing of a violin string. Thirdly, structure in the complex plane – invisible in the formulation of the problem – plays a crucial part in the proof, which is philosophically intriguing. And, finally, the systems in question could be used to design data series as input into and inspiration for the creative process. From these discussions, Howard evolved new artistic practice underpinned by latest results in dynamical systems research. As an evolution of this creative practice, she went on to draw inspiration directly from other areas of excellent research within Liverpool’s Department of Mathematical Sciences. A further example is given below. 

 Anna Pratoussevitch is a Reader in Pure Mathematics, researching **geometry and topology**. To explore pseudo\-Riemannian space forms of constant curvature, Pratoussevitch constructs fundamental domains in the shape of higher\-dimensional polyhedra **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. A central question of low\-dimensional topology has been the classification of 3\-dimensional manifolds. Thurston's approach to this problem, that any 3\-manifold can be constructed from building blocks carrying one of 8 Riemannian geometries, has contributed significantly to our understanding of low\-dimensional manifolds, including the celebrated proof of the Poincaré conjecture by Perelman. Pratoussevitch's work explores the implications of this approach in pseudo\-Riemannian 3\-manifolds by describing how pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature can be constructed from pseudo\-Riemannian polyhedra by gluing together pairs of 2\-dimensional faces. The constructions of building block manifolds from polyhedra in both Riemannian and pseudo\-Riemannian geometry give excellent visual representations of 3\-dimensional objects that cannot be easily visualized in 3D space. Pratoussevitch explored these fundamental ideas of positive and negative curvature in different spaces alongside images of the polyhedra with composer Howard, initiating new creative thinking about shapes and space to inspire new orchestral music.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 This body of pure mathematics research has brought about three principal impacts on creativity, culture and society: 

-  **4.1.** New creative thinking that transformed the practice and career of composer Emily Howard **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. 

-  **4.2.** Seven musical works over five years, with diverse coverage to wide critical acclaim **\[5.1, 5.3\-8\]**. 

-  **4.3.** Dedicated centre for Practice & Research in Science & Music \(PRiSM\) in Manchester that is influencing composer practice nationally **\[5.1, 5.8\-10\]**. 

###  4.1. Dynamical systems research transforms practice of composer 

 Rempe and Liverpool’s Department of Mathematical Sciences hosted freelance composer Emily Howard as Leverhulme Trust Artist in Residence between February and November 2015 **\[5.2\]**. A mathematics graduate herself, Howard’s fluency in mathematical language enabled her not only to absorb general ideas, but also to discuss details and subtleties of contemporary mathematical research. According to Howard, this made for an ‘ *appealing and distinctive*’ partnership **\[5.1\]**. 

 Working with Rempe and Pratoussevitch provided Howard with unique insights into frontier mathematical research, taking her creative ideas beyond classical mathematical principles for the first time **\[5.1\]**. Howard joined Rempe and his group in discussions about their research throughout 2015, with particular focus on Rempe’s work on the Arnold family **\[3.1\]**. The group created two sets of numeric data for Howard, encapsulating key ideas in the result and its proof. These datasets and discussions were pivotal creative input for Howard’s 2015 compositions described below, establishing enduring principles for her entire approach to composition **\[5.1\]**. Howard explains how this opportunity **‘ **transformed my creative practice at the time and has continued to influence my entire creative approach and musical works since’* **\[5.1\]**. 

###  4.2. Audiences, listeners, music venues, publishers, record labels and performing ensembles benefit from new critically\-acclaimed music 

 The body of research **\[3.1\-4\]** influenced seven critically acclaimed musical works of increasing profile **\[5.3\-4\]**. Audiences in the UK, Germany, Canada and the US, BBC audiences and the wider public have benefitted from sold\-out live performances, radio and streaming **\[5.3\-4\]**. Edition Peters, a world\-leading publisher of classical sheet music who only publishes music with ‘ *sufficient commercial benefit*’ **\[5.5a\]**, signed Howard in March 2019 **\[5.5b\]**. Accompanying programme notes detail how the music is a response to Liverpool’s research **\[5.5c\]**. 

 *Torus* \(2016\) is the first of three geometry\-inspired orchestral works drawing on Howard’s engagement with mathematics research. *Torus* was a **BBC Proms** co\-commission with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, first performed in 2016 at the iconic **Royal Albert Hall** **\[5.3a\]** to a sell\-out audience of 4,294 **\[5.3b\]**. Hailed by **The Guardian** as *‘one of this year’s finest new works’* **\[5.6a\]** and ‘ *visionary*’ by **The Times** **\[5.6b\]**, the piece was recognised with a 2017 **British Composer Award* **\[5.6c\]**, the highest industry recognition for excellence in classical composition. *Torus* was described by the judges as ‘ *captivating from start to finish*’ **\[5.6c\]**. 

 The **Barbican Centre, London**, Europe’s largest performing arts centre, where a live performance of *Torus* by the BBC Symphony Orchestra took place in 2019, describe the piece as ‘ *startling*’ **\[5.3c, 5.8\]**. *Torus* has featured twice on BBC Radio 3 **\[5.3d,e\]**, most recently in 2019 to approximately 333,000 listeners **\[5.3f\]**. Howard deliberately included in *Torus* a ‘ *crucial “perturbation”: a moment where, as in your* \[Rempe’s\] *work, the parameters of the system change slightly to dramatic effect’* **\[5.1\]**. *sphere* \(2017\) was commissioned by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, Germany and broadcast on **BBC Radio 3** **\[5.3g\]** to approximately 310,000 listeners **\[5.3f\]**. Howard explains how ‘ *Several conceptual ideas from dynamical systems* \[Rempe\] *as well as ideas from topology and geometry* \[Pratoussevitch\] *stemming from conversations with researchers at Liverpool have noticeably influenced the work’* **\[5.2\]**. 

 *Antisphere* was commissioned by the Barbican with internationally renowned conductor **Sir Simon Rattle** to open the **London Symphony Orchestra’s** 2019/20 season **\[5.3h, 5.8\]** to a live audience of 1,419 people **\[5.3i\]**. The Barbican’s Classical Programming Coordinator describes this ‘ *dynamic contribution*’ to the Barbican’s 2019/20 programme \- **‘ **bringing to life** **the close connections between the arts and sciences in a truly engaging way**’** and bringing about ‘ *widespread media coverage in national outlets, including interviews on BBC Radio 4*’ **\[5.8\]**. By this time, Howard was credited by Sir Simon Rattle as a *‘gifted composer’*, with her music always having ‘ *a scientific picture behind it*’ and her ‘ *own very particular sound world*’ **\[5.7\]**. 

 Other pieces influenced directly by Rempe’s research include *Leviathan* \(2015\), creating ‘ *a newly‐formed and unpredictable musical language, which responds to recent mathematical research in dynamical systems’* **\[5.5c\]**. Howard explains why this research was important: ‘ *The contrast of chaos in a…system and the stability of neighbouring systems was of particular interest to me, and the connection to physical systems – in particular phase\-locking – and its relevance to musical instruments*’ **\[5.1\]**. *Leviathan* was performed in 2015 in Montreal, Toronto, Detroit, Chicago and New York **\[5.5c\]** as well as six venues in the UK. 

 Howard’s song *Threnos* \(2015\) was broadcast by **BBC Singers** in November 2019 **\[5.3j\]** to approximately 227,000 radio listeners **\[5.3f\]**. *Threnos* and *Leviathan* were recorded for the **NMC Recordings Label** and commercially released in 2016 on Howard’s NMC Disc *Magnetite* **\[5.4\]**, which received four stars from **The Guardian** \[5.6d\]**. The album liner explains how dynamical systems \(specifically the chaotic motion of a forced oscillator\) directly informed the time structure of the work **\[5.4d\]**. At November 2020 it had been streamed 32,950 times, more than ten times that of an equivalent collection released that year **\[5.4e\]**. 

 *Orbit 1a and Orbit 2a* \(2015\) are a direct response to the datasets provided by Rempe’s group. Howard explains ‘ *I selected different musical properties to represent unstable and stable periodic orbits and depicted the specific moment of perturbation \(where the underlying rules of the systems change\) as a definite event’* **\[5.1\]**. Continuing the Orbits series, *Chaos or Chess* \(2016\) is influenced in a *‘more abstract conceptual way by your* \[Rempe’s\] *proof and our stimulating discussions*’, as for *Threnos* **\[5.1\]**. *Orbit 1a* and *Chaos or Chess* were performed live on **BBC Radio 3** in 2016 **\[5.3k\]** and the latter at the Edinburgh Science Festival in 2019 **\[5.3l\]**. 

###  4.3. New dedicated centre for science and music \(PRiSM\) influences other composers 

 Engaging with Liverpool’s research **\[3.1\-4\]** transformed Howard’s approach to composition, shifting the foundations of her entire creative practice, career and outputs: ‘ *Since we* \[Howard and Rempe\] *pioneered this approach, I actively seek out other mathematicians and scientists as rich sources of creative input, made possible through the mathematical confidence I developed during the Liverpool residency… **Through the vehicle of PRiSM** \[centre for Practice & Research in Science & Music\] **we are influencing other composers to change creative practice at national scale \- bringing together a unique community of practitioners and researchers.** *This propagation is evidence of the success and sustainability of the creative approach we pioneered together in Liverpool*’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 In 2017 Howard co\-established PRiSM at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, of which Rempe is a founding Associate member **\[5.1, 5.9a\]**. **Marcus du Sautoy** \(Co\-Director of PRiSM and Simonyi Professor, University of Oxford\) asserts Rempe’s ‘ *pioneering collaboration with Emily was instrumental to the inception of PRiSM*’ **\[5.10\]**. 

 PRiSM is building on the approach developed at Liverpool to benefit composers, curators and audiences through high\-profile commissions. Artificial Intelligence \(AI\)\-generated music in association with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra **\[5.9b\]** is one example. This featured on the **Royal Institution Christmas Lectures** **2019* **\[5.9c\]**, broadcast on BBC 4 and available afterwards on BBC iPlayer, attracting 559,813 views \(03\-03\-2020\) **\[5.9d\]**. Another composer explains how a PRiSM collaboration in 2020 changed her practice: ‘ *I had never before used a scientific paper as a starting point for creating music, and now I am looking at using many different types of text to inform my work as an opera composer*’ **\[5.9e\]**. The **Barbican Centre** evaluates a PRiSM event in 2019: a ‘ *ground\-breaking team of composers from PRiSM*… *leading to new insights*’, enabling the venue to *‘reach an audience outside of our usual classical attenders’,* bringing *‘almost double the expected audience numbers*’; it ‘ *worked so well …we are also looking for further opportunities to involve guest curators in our work*’; benefits to performers include ‘ *using new technologies… which they intend to use more in their day\-to\-day work*’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 *‘ **With the world around us changing, I believe the Barbican’s vision of ‘Arts without Boundaries’ is more vital than ever and that Emily Howard and PRiSM’s innovative works are advancing our progress in realising this vision**’* **\[5.8\]** – The Barbican Centre.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research on digital technology and political communication by Dr Srinivasan and his team led multiple development agencies in East Africa, including the United Nations Children’s Fund \(UNICEF\), the United States Agency for International Development \(USAID\) and the World Bank, to integrate citizens’ views in their strategy and operations. Srinivasan co\-founded a spin\-out charity, the Africa’s Voices Foundation, in order to translate research on interactive radio into a mixed\-method approach through which governments and aid agencies could increase citizen participation. This charity has continued to draw upon the research in its subsequent work, and the research approach is now used extensively in Somalia and Kenya. Africa’s Voices was awarded the Market Research Society’s President’s Medal for Social Impact in 2016. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2010, Dr Srinivasan, Lecturer in Governance and Human Rights at the University of Cambridge, has led an interdisciplinary research programme that includes political and social scientists, linguists, and computer scientists. Their research demonstrated the importance of interactive radio shows for deepening civic engagement in East Africa. They developed new data collection techniques to process high volumes of digital text from radio shows, and mixed methods social research approaches to interpret data and apply their findings in policy contexts. The research had four phases. 

 **Phase 1: Identification of an important but under\-studied phenomenon \(2010\-2011\)** 

 In 2010, Srinivasan identified a gap in knowledge about a popular socio\-political phenomenon in many African countries: interactive call\-in or text\-in radio shows. A University of Cambridge study led by Srinivasan found that citizens actively engaged with one another and government through interactive public affairs shows in Kenya, Zambia and Uganda \[R1\]. It also found some stations were better than others at curating discussion with diverse citizens and policy makers. 

 **Phase 2: Determining how social and political factors affect show popularity \(2011\-2015\)** 

 Comparative research in Kenya and Zambia, led by Srinivasan, with postdocs from the University of Cambridge and partners from the Universities of Zambia and Nairobi, discovered when and how interactive broadcast shows might enhance political accountability. They found that the popularity of interactive shows resulted from authorities, presenters and audiences investing them with different meanings \[R2\]. Audiences participated more when they experienced the show as a constructive social interaction \[R3\]. Also, the show format affected the scale and dynamism of participation. These factors explained why many formulaic approaches to interactive shows on governance and development failed to generate active and diverse engagement. They showed that it was necessary to design shows that take into account how and why actors participate \[R3\]. 

 **Phase 3: Designing a methodology to study public opinion \(2012\-2015\)** 

 Abreu Lopes and Srinivasan implemented a quasi\-experimental pilot project in eight countries to test ways to generate participation and analyse data using interactive radio. There were two main findings \[R4\]. First, the mode of asking questions affected participation \(e.g. it increases when audiences can provide an open text explanation in their own language\). Second, shows had to be analysed as a space for social interaction, similar to a focus group. Researchers also confronted a methodological challenge: manual coding could not readily be scaled up for multiple languages and large data volumes. In 2014 Abreu Lopes was seconded to IBM Research\-Africa to test how computational linguistic techniques might address this issue. 

 **Phase 4: Application of social and methodological findings to policy \(2015\-2020\)** 

 In late 2014, Srinivasan co\-founded a spin\-out charity, the Africa’s Voices Foundation \(AVF\), to utilise the research to assist policy actors in civic engagement. Research has since been conducted collaboratively between the University and AVF. This included technologists \(Blackwell, Church\) and computational linguistics \(Buttery, Caines\) at the University of Cambridge. They focused on improving the quality and speed of data processing, and designing tools to interpret large volumes of complex textual data. In 2016, with Srinivasan, Blackwell led a team in developing a new open\-source software called CODA. CODA uses human\-computer interaction design for more efficient and reliable qualitative coding of text data at scale \[R5\]. The team’s earlier research, on designing mixed methods to analyse open text data, guided the software’s development in order to preserve the richness of citizen contributions. In 2017\-2019, Srinivasan, Riha, Abreu Lopes and Denyer\-Willis evaluated the interactive radio method’s efficacy in health emergencies.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Through the Africa’s Voices Foundation \(AVF\), a spin\-out charity that applies the research findings, the research has enabled aid actors and governments to better solicit and understand citizens’ views in Somalia and Kenya, and be more responsive to citizens’ needs. The method is effective in contexts where in\-person research is unfeasible or expensive, including remote or conflict\-affected areas, and humanitarian emergencies. In 2016, the world’s leading professional social and market research association, the Market Research Society \(MRS\), awarded AVF the President’s Medal for Social Impact. The MRS President said, “ *In a country with insecure and inaccessible regions, Africa’s Voices has developed an admirable partnership with UNICEF Somalia. Their work helps to amplify the voices of hard\-to\-reach communities and is proof positive of research as a force for good*” \[E1\]. 

 Srinivasan, with Lord Cairns, established AVF in late 2014 as a non\-profit organisation and registered UK charity \(no. 1159589\). Srinivasan was seconded to AVF from 2017\-2019 to ensure that it utilised the research effectively, and remained involved as an advisor since. Utilising the University of Cambridge team’s research, the charity offers a unique service: it convenes large\-scale discussions among citizens using interactive radio \[R2\]\[R3\], and deploys a mixed methods approach to analyse large numbers of SMS contributions \[R5\]. AVF then provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of citizen perspectives to governments and aid agencies. 

 Based in Nairobi, AVF has grown into a sustainable charity with an annual programme income of GBP1,400,000 \(2019\), and a staff of over 20 \[E2, p.144\]. AVF has worked with over 15 development actors, including: European Union \(EU\) International Organization on Migration, Mastercard Foundation, Oxfam Kenya, Trocaire, UNICEF Somalia, United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) Somalia, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \(OCHA\), USAID, and the World Bank \[E2, p. 41, 102, 104, 141\-2\]. AVF’s contribution to their programming and strategy is evidenced in its ongoing work in Somalia, detailed below. 

1.  **Greater inclusion of citizen views in UN and World Bank annual planning** 

 AVF assisted UN agencies and the World Bank to incorporate citizen engagement into planning processes. Since 2018 UN Somalia’s Humanitarian Needs Overview \(HNO\) \(the UN’s major annual planning document in Somalia\) has relied on AVF’s approach. The 2019 HNO \[E3\] stated that feedback through interactive radio enabled them to adjust activities in response to people’s concerns. It affirmed the value of AVF’s approach to incorporating citizen voices to their planning: 

 *""Interactive radio programmes and SMS messaging by the Africa’s Voices Foundation additionally garnered feedback from close to 9,000 individuals across every region in Somalia. A very high proportion of respondents \(87%\) indicated that they felt the consultations had made them feel more included in decision\-making, and the same proportion further reported that they would like to see this process repeated.""* \[E3, p. 16\] 

 AVF also contributed to the 2020 HNO, evidencing changes in citizen views \[E4, pp. 11, 26\-28\]. 

 In 2019, AVF helped the World Bank to review its strategy in Somalia by convening interactive radio shows and analysing public views. The World Bank Country Manager asserts about AVF, 

 “*Their work tackles an important challenge for the World Bank in Somalia and many other country contexts: namely inclusive approaches to civic engagement and rigorous methods for drawing insights from citizens into more accountable and participatory policy planning processes.*” \[E5\] 

 AVF’s approach led to internal reflection in the World Bank team. The Country Manager states: 

 *“As a direct result the team is re\-considering the importance of health programming and community engagement. This kind of intervention is a game\-changer for civic engagement efforts in Somalia.”* \[E5\] 

1.  **Innovation in social programme design, including in health emergencies** 

 AVF’s interactive shows and analyses contributed to important innovations in aid agencies’ social programming. AVF assisted UNICEF Somalia in better engaging target populations and gathering detailed social insights. In 2016\-2017, AVF designed and delivered more than 25 shows on 21 radio stations for UNICEF Somalia. Over 52,000 Somalis participated. AVF’s insights on citizens’ views informed internal discussions in the development of UNICEF Somalia’s 2018\-2020 Gender and Child Protection programme strategy \[E2\(b\)\]. UNICEF Somalia’s 2017 Annual Report attests to AVF’s contribution: 

 “*Africa’s Voices Foundation utilized a semantic analysis tool for capturing and categorizing the responses received, producing several short analytical products around the recipients’ insights on behaviours and key themes. This feedback has informed the development of a new targeted strategy for behaviour change for the different sectors which will continue to be implemented in 2018.*” \[E6, p.11\] 

 The rigour of the analysis was key to its adoption. The UNICEF Chief of Child Protection wrote: 

 *“The Africa's Voices programme is one of the most articulate pieces of research I've seen on social norms in Somalia. It is the first time I've been given the tools to start applying this kind of scientific rigour to social norms programming and I'm finding it quite exciting and thought\-provoking. The insights should be critical in our strategies for UNICEF's social norms pillar in 2018.”* \[E2\(a\), p. 30\] 

 The Somalia Stability Fund \(SSF\), a large multi\-donor fund, used AVF’s approach to achieve more inclusive participation in its programmes. In 2019, SSF invested USD1,000,000 in AVF to deliver a nationwide gender equality and social inclusion programme. The SSF Head of Risk, Finance and Procurement identifies two changes that occurred as a result \[E7\]. First, SSF achieved a greater scale of engagement with over 900,000 Somalis listening \(according to an independent representative telephone survey\) and over 53,000 Somalis participating. The show’s design \[R2\] was key to this. Second, data analysis of audience contributions was new, and used to tailor communication to encourage gender equality and social inclusion. A testimonial on behalf of the SSF Team Leader states: 

 *“What makes this programme truly innovative and a step beyond other interactive media programmes that SSF has funded previously is that the data generated from citizen engagement is analysed and allowed AVF to identify key issues for audiences and weave these back into programmes in a way that positively challenges audience perceptions about gender norms.”* \[E7\] 

 Finally, AVF’s support for early COVID\-19 responses evidenced the adaptability of the research methodology to support programming. The team’s research on how to use it in public health interventions enabled AVF to move quickly to support COVID\-19 risk communication in Somalia and Kenya. In April 2020, AVF collected and analysed over 7,500 individuals’ views on COVID\-19. It identified that stigma and misinformation were widespread, and addressing these required working with trusted religious authorities. Based on this work, SSF and UNICEF commissioned AVF to conduct further COVID\-19 programming in Somalia, responding to their earlier findings and bringing religious leaders and content into radio discussions \[E8\]. 

1.  **Strengthened public accountability through improved communication** 

 AVF adapted its application of the research to respond to donor and government needs. A key innovation was the creation of a Common Social Accountability Platform, which was designed to improve citizen\-authority relations through interactive radio and analysis. The EU, the Horn/East Africa\-wide Regional Durable Solutions Secretariat, International Organization on Migration, UNICEF, UNDP, UN Habitat and the World Bank utilised this platform in Somalia to foster better citizen\-authority relations. The Durable Solutions Coordinator in the Integrated Office of the UN Resident Coordinator for Somalia explains: 

 *“The work conducted with AVF showed clearly that, through radio shows and … text messages free of charge, groups that traditionally are excluded and marginalised in the public arena have the possibility to express their opinions on decisions that affect their lives. … We have had a very enthusiastic and positive feedback from local government actors who indicated that this methodology has enhanced their insight into the perceptions of the public on their work.”* \[E9\] 

 For example, AVF worked with the Banadir Regional Administration, federal authority for the Mogadishu region, to address the city’s displacement crisis. AVF identified ways that people thought that authorities might better support vulnerable citizens, such as ‘crowd\-funding’ \- a salient proposal in a society dependent on remittances but which had not featured much in prior programming \[E10\]. Citizen engagement also helped to strengthen citizen\-authority relations. In a post\-project evaluation, a female participant underscored this impact: 

 “*I feel involved because community consultation is always the best thing to do. I personally believe that I am part of the decisions in the community and we very much appreciate those who made this safe space to talk, like the radio presenters, the leaders involved.”* \[E10, p. 8\] 

 Donor, government and citizen feedback to AVF identified a shared interest in more interactive citizen engagement with authorities. In 2019, Srinivasan and Church decided to create a social business with AVF, katikati, to expand technological capacities in \[R5\] to manage two\-way SMS conversations at scale in any language. These University of Cambridge researchers designed and developed the technology, and worked with AVF to apply it to governance challenges \[E8\]. In late 2019, they won a global impact award \(USD150,000\) from Twilio to develop an open\-source capability for humanitarian organisations to use the katikati technology in global crisis response \[E11\]. In mid\-2020, AVF deployed katikati in Kenya and Somalia to respond to stigma and misinformation about COVID\-19, in collaboration with UNICEF, UNDP and SSF \[E8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Human–wildlife conflict \(HWC\) is one of the most pressing and complex challenges for global wildlife conservation. Understanding the factors that cause it is crucial in preventing it. 

 The impact described in this case study results from over 20 years of research conducted by Professor Catherine Hill into human–wildlife interactions and conservation conflicts in Africa. Her research shows that conflicts about wildlife are often the result of different groups’ cultural values and priorities, and unequal power relations. Previously it was thought that these conflicts were the result of ecological or economic impacts of wildlife. Professor Hill’s methodological focus on ‘positionality’ \(an understanding of how a person’s identity impacts and possibly prejudices their interpretation of the world\) has also been influential. 

 Findings from this extensive research have informed international conservation guidelines, improved the skills of government wildlife agencies and conservation non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\), and influenced policy. Through training events it has also changed management practices – promoting coexistence strategies in local farming practices, and enhancing local livelihoods without harming wildlife, as seen in Uganda. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research led by Professor Hill has explored social and biological aspects of human–wildlife interactions and HWC in Masindi and Hoima District, Uganda \(2010–2020\), Cantanez National Park \(2012–2018\), Guinea Bissau and, most recently, in southeastern Madagascar \(2016–\). 

 From the start, Professor Hill and her research students and postdoctoral researchers have followed an interdisciplinary approach. This has involved using social science methods such as participant observation and qualitative interview techniques combined with quantitative, systematic ecological surveys and behavioural observation of animals. This has enabled a more nuanced understanding of the complex nature of human–animal relationships. Interdisciplinary approaches to this type of research are now more common, but during the first decade of Professor Hill’s research her approach was ground\-breaking. The research has been externally funded by research grants from The Leverhulme Trust, The North of England Zoological Society, and Maurice Lang Foundation, totalling £146,765. 

 In her earlier work, beginning in 2000, Professor Hill examined how sharing landscapes with wildlife \(including protected species such as elephants and chimpanzees\) impacted on Ugandan farmers’ lives and livelihood security. She determined: 

-  the degree to which different food crops commonly grown in western and northwestern Uganda are vulnerable to damage by wildlife species 

-  how different cropping strategies affect patterns of crop damage, including the risk of incurring damage by wildlife 

-  how conflicts about wildlife are, in reality, conflicts between different human groups as a result of their different value systems, beliefs, priorities, power and agendas **\[R1\]**. 

 The focus of Professor Hill’s more recent research has built on earlier work, but has incorporated a more explicitly applied approach: 

-  examining how changing land\-use strategies and increased cash\-cropping in response to national policies to reduce rural poverty can make farmers less tolerant of sharing space with wildlife **\[R2\]** 

-  working closely with smallholder farmers at all project stages to develop and trial a series of humane, non\-lethal crop protection tools to reduce crop damage by non\-human primates and other wildlife species **\[R3\]**. 

 All crop protection methods \(such as different models of hedging, fencing, early warning systems, use of repellents\) were developed in collaboration with local farmers. They were trialled on farms to test how well they reduced crop damage by primates. The farmers chose to keep all crop protection installations on their farms after the end of the trials, and initial feedback from farmers during the trial period was strongly positive **\[R4\]**. 

 Professor Hill’s work also explores the social complexities that underlie people’s complaints about wildlife, and their retaliatory behaviour. There is a focus on instances where people’s reaction to an animal seems excessive in relation to the losses or inconvenience experienced **\[R5\]**. Farmer conflict narratives have highlighted local people’s concerns about the unpredictable and uncontrollable nature of wildlife incursions. This is in the context of restrictions requiring farmers to repel ‘invading’ wildlife to comply with national and international conservation legislation **\[R1, R5\]**. Farmers expressed their unhappiness with ‘the government’ that, in their view, forced them to share landscapes with wildlife without compensating them for crop losses, or for the additional time they had to spend protecting their crops from ‘the government’s cattle’, as wild animals were sometimes referred to **\[R1, R2\]**. 

 Professor Hill and Dr Matthew McLennan were among the first to acknowledge the lack of recognition or discussion of positionality of researchers and practitioners in conservation science. Using case study research, which focused on human–chimpanzee relations in Uganda, they showed that assumptions made by members of other interest groups \(in this case local farmers\) about conservationists and researchers influences how conservationist/researcher actions are interpreted. In turn, this affects how conservation messages are interpreted and conveyed by others **\[R6\]**. This has the potential to create further mistrust between local people, government wildlife officials, conservation NGO representatives and researchers, and can inflame existing conflicts and even create new conflicts about wildlife. 

 Examining and acknowledging individual and institutional positionalities – motivations, values and belief systems, priorities and agendas – is central to understanding the intentional or unintentional impacts conservation actors can have on any HWC. It helps to clarify when and why conservation actors, and other stakeholders, may disagree in their respective agendas and priorities. It helps to explain why conservation actors are often not best placed to act as ‘third\-party neutral’ facilitators in HWC, and the likely implications when they do take on these roles **\[R6\]**. The importance of considering positionality in human–wildlife conservation has continued as a focus in Professor Hill’s work, including most recently in her contributions to the content of the forthcoming International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Task Force Guidelines on Human Wildlife Conflict.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Professor Hill’s cumulative and detailed research findings have had a clear impact by changing human behaviours, enhancing livelihoods and improving interactions with wildlife, across a range of countries. Specifically, her findings have made a significant contribution to changing farmers’ and wildlife managers’ behaviour and practices in the face of crop damage by primates in Uganda, and more widely throughout Africa. This is as a result of research\-informed training activities. 

 More broadly, the research has promoted greater understanding of human conflicts about wildlife. This has been achieved by integrating biological and social science perspectives and challenging established assumptions about the causes and implications of wildlife conflicts. In turn this has led to the development of effective, humane, non\-lethal methods to reduce crop damage. 

 Professor Hill’s findings have also had a clear and beneficial impact on local coexistence practices, livelihoods and international guidelines. Beneficiaries of her research include smallholder farmers, conservation NGOs, and government wildlife and agricultural agencies. This impact has been achieved through: 

-  the development of small\-scale, cost\-effective crop protection tools 

-  training events for wildlife managers working with HWC 

-  research results that directly inform NGO policy and specially designed information, distributed to farmers to promote human–primate coexistence. 

 These specific impacts are explained in more detail below. 

####  Empowering African farmers to develop humane methods for reducing crop damage 

 Professor Hill’s research has informed the development and use of humane, non\-lethal methods to reduce crop damage by primates such as the chimpanzee \( *Pan troglodytes*\), classed as Endangered, baboons \( *Papio* spp.\) and wild pigs \( *Sus* spp.\). These methods involve improving detection rates of animal incursions to fields through early warning systems, enabling farm guards to respond faster and more effectively to such events, and using barrier methods to deflect wildlife movements away from fields. This combination of methods helps farmers by reducing crop losses, enhancing livelihood security. It also supports Ugandan and international conservation policy and practice by reducing farmers’ use of lethal crop protection methods, especially with wildlife species classed as Endangered or Vulnerable by IUCN, directly benefiting wildlife conservation in Africa. 

 Subsequent work confirmed that farmers continued to use the new tools after the original project finished in 2007. The farmers remained positive in their assessment of crop protection tools’ effectiveness and practicality. These practices also spread to other farmers in the locality, who copied installations trialled on their neighbours’ farms in the original study **\[S1\]**. Because of Covid\-19 restrictions it has not been possible to verify whether these tools are still in use currently, as a funded and planned research\-evaluation trip has been postponed. However, various of these techniques are now being introduced and trialled at other sites in Africa **\[S7\]**. 

 Professor Hill’s research findings have informed the strategic planning process of the NGO Village Enterprise. This is a well\-established NGO, operating in Uganda and Kenya since 1987 \( [https://villageenterprise.org/](https://villageenterprise.org/)\), whose mission statement is ‘To end extreme poverty in rural Africa through entrepreneurship and innovation’. It focuses on reducing rural poverty through a development programme, supporting local farmers to set up profitable micro\-agricultural businesses without making existing or future HWCs worse. Information from Professor Hill’s research was incorporated into Village Enterprise’s work in Uganda and Kenya in several ways. First, it informed the organisation’s strategic planning and business/conservation training programmes. Her results were shared with NGO business mentors, so that they could more effectively support their mentees. The research findings also informed a list of non\-fundable, micro\-business enterprises that could negatively impact on local and national conservation initiatives. Evidence of each of these areas of contribution is provided in a letter from the organisation’s senior director of programmes and operations **\[S2\]**. 

 Other beneficiaries of Hill’s research include Connected Conservation, which was established in 1994 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. This organisation works in conservation planning, conflict and coexistence strategies and economic development around wildlife. Various of Professor Hill’s research findings have been used by the organisation to complete several projects commissioned by the Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area \(KAZA TFCA\) secretariat, a government organisation. Professor Hill’s work has been particularly important as a source of material for producing infographics to support farmer–wildlife coexistence within the KAZA TFCA in central southern Africa \(Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe\). As Connected Conservation’s director states: ‘Our firm completed a survey of conflict with all wild animals in the KAZA region and relied heavily on the work of Dr Hill and her students on useful examples of how farmers cope with primates and conducting social science around conflict situations. Last year we were engaged again by the KAZA secretariat to develop a series of infographics to help farmers in the five countries and we revisited Dr Hill’s work to find practical examples we could draw from this body of research’ **\[S8\]**. 

####  Supporting wildlife management, conservation funders and government and NGO policy makers working to address HWC 

 Professor Hill’s research has had a material impact on African wildlife managers’ knowledge and practice, through training events targeting wildlife managers working across Africa. Examples include invitations for Professor Hill to develop and deliver training on ‘Understanding and Responding to Conflicts about Wildlife’ as part of the Pathways Africa Conference training series, in Kenya \(2016\) and Namibia \(2018\) \( [https://sites.warnercnr.colostate.edu/pathways\-africa/](https://sites.warnercnr.colostate.edu/pathways-africa/)\). These events were aimed at early and mid\-career government and NGO wildlife officers working in countries throughout Africa. They focused on providing managers with: 

-  a clear understanding of the social complexities around conflicts about wildlife 

-  simple tools and techniques to reduce direct costs to farmers of sharing space with non\-human primates **\[as per R3\]**, for example using a combination of hedges, fencing and aromatic plants to redirect animal movements away from standing crops 

-  basic tools to carry out pre\-intervention information\-gathering exercises and post\-intervention evaluation. 

 Over 50 delegates from more than 10 African countries took part in the training provided during the Kenya conference; 42 trainees from 12 different African countries attended the training in Namibia in 2018. Post\-training feedback collected 12 months after the 2016 Kenya HWC training indicates that the majority of those who attended \(14/16\) reported that they had used the tools/skills they learned at the training events during the past year in the execution of their job. 

 The report from the 2018 training in Namibia provides evidence of changed behaviours and understandings in relation to wildlife conflict, stating that: ‘Of the 13 modules that were offered at the training, Conflict Transformation, Project Leadership and Human–Wildlife Conflict were the most liked by the trainees … Most trainees indicate that they liked these modules because the knowledge was important in their day\-to\-day jobs’ **\[S3, S4\]**. 

 Professor Hill’s expertise in human–wildlife interactions and conservation social science led to her being invited to become a member of the IUCN Human Wildlife Conflict Task Force. Her innovative, interdisciplinary research has underpinned her expert contributions as a member of this international organisation **\[S5\]**. This international advisory group is tasked with providing expert support and guidance to the IUCN Species Survival Commission, including developing technical guidance materials and international training for groups working on HWC issues. The IUCN Guidelines are designed for project managers, funders and government policy makers. Professor Hill is lead author on sections of the guidelines, focusing on: 

-  the importance of cultural understanding and sensitivity when working with HWC scenarios 

-  the importance of understanding practitioner and researcher positionality, and how this impacts all actors’ roles, relationships and likely effectiveness in conflict mitigation interventions. **\[S6\]** 

 This is important because a key aspect of training conservation science researchers and managers is positionality, yet this has rarely been a focus in conservation and wildlife management training or policy, to date. Addressing this in future training and policy production is crucial to enable more effective ways of addressing and preventing future HWCs. 

 HWCs have been identified as a key conservation concern for the 21st century. Professor Hill’s research has demonstrated reach and relevance through contributions to the development of conservation practices and crop protection actions in Uganda and other parts of Africa, and to international guidelines for wildlife protection.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from the University of Manchester \(UoM\)’s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research \(Tyndall\-Manchester\) identified the failure of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation policies in the shipping and aviation sectors to align with the Paris Agreement climate targets. The research characterised the impact of this failure, and published decarbonisation pathways that have engaged international, national and local policy and industry stakeholders and influenced debate at multiple scales. 

 Global CO<sub>2</sub> targets have now been set by the International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\), through the adoption of resolution MEPC.304\(72\) as a direct result of Tyndall\-Manchester research. In the aviation sector, Tyndall\-Manchester research quantified the extent of technical improvement possible, noting the contradiction between expected aviation emissions growth with the Paris Agreement targets. The Heathrow third runway expansion policy passed by the UK Government was rejected at judicial review because of this inconsistency. The Manchester Climate Change Framework has adopted aviation climate policies because of Tyndall\-Manchester input. This has reduced investment and policy risk for business and local government by recognising this source of emissions in subsequent spatial and economic planning, avoiding the need for late, costly, reactive responses. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 The research on the shipping and aviation sectors generated three key findings that underpin the impact. 

 Paper **\[1\]** identified that omitting international aviation and shipping from the UN’s climate change target framework is a major risk to the 2 °C goal because of the significant climate impact of these emissions. Paper **\[2\]** provided specific insights into the structure and capabilities of the shipping sector, and showed that there are many technical options for decarbonising shipping. For instance, hull and propeller redesign, in combination with speed changes, fuel switching to bioenergy or hydrogen, and wind assistance. It also showed that setting an ambitious target for the shipping industry is not as high risk as it is for aviation. Paper **\[3\]** then quantified the implications of the Paris Agreement mitigation targets for international shipping by relating the IPCC AR5 Synthesis report cumulative emissions budget findings with fleet efficiency trajectories from the reference scenarios of the Third IMO GHG \[Greenhouse Gas\] Study \(2014\), demonstrating the necessity of urgent CO<sub>2</sub> targets. 

 **Finding 1:** **The shipping sector has a similar greenhouse gas emissions reduction challenge as aviation, but with greater potential for technical solutions. It is feasible and necessary to set ambitious CO<sub>2</sub> targets as a matter of urgency.** 

 A sequence of EPSRC funded interdisciplinary projects, conducted by the Tyndall\-Manchester team, explored the challenge of decarbonising international transport. They calculated the expected future emission from the aviation sector following workshops and interviews with industry to assess technical mitigation potential **\[4\]**. The finding of expected rates of emissions increase indicated that demand management and emissions trading deserved greater research and policy attention. The research considered voluntary carbon trading and concluded that this was unlikely to address the matter either. The “tonnes of carbon” included in these trading systems were found not to be physical tonnes of material, and so carbon trading for emissions growth would likely increase the extent of climate change. The research quantified the risk to UK climate change targets if airport expansion continues and demonstrated that as for shipping, leaving aviation outside of the UN’s climate change target framework is a major risk to the 2 °C goal **\[1, 4\]**. 

 **Finding 2: **The aviation sector currently produces 10% of UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and this is likely to increase to levels incompatible with UK and global CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation targets. Technical mitigation potential to cut CO<sub>2</sub> is less than the necessary rate of reduction.** 

 Research funded by the North West Regional Development Agency explored the UK regional distribution of aviation emissions, developing the first methodology for sub\-national apportionment for international aviation emissions **\[5\]**. Further funded work identified the implications of current UK government aviation emissions projections for national carbon budgets and the constraints they place on other sectors **\[6\]**. Unachievable emission reduction rates, greater than 20% *per annum*, were found to be required from the rest of the economy if aviation grows at the rate forecast by the UK’s Department for Transport \(DfT\) and if national climate policy is aligned with the UN Paris Agreement. 

 **Finding 3: **If the aviation sector takes a disproportionate share of future emissions, then the pressure on other sectors may inhibit regional development or jeopardise the overall climate objective.**

##  4. Details of the impact 

###  Context 

 Greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and shipping are largely unregulated. Tyndall\-Manchester research in the period 2003–2007 overturned the prevailing orthodoxy in national climate change mitigation policy that regarded international shipping and aviation as unproblematic, minor sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policy developments followed. The global nature of climate change necessitates a comprehensive emission mitigation framework, since partial coverage will be both physically ineffective and economically inefficient increasing the cost to society. If shipping and aviation are excluded from mitigation efforts then other emitting sectors will be required to go further by, for instance, reducing their economic activity or investing in more costly abatement technology, or suffer damages due to greater climate change impacts. 

###  Pathways to Impact – Shipping 

 In 2009, the need for significant and meaningful CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation targets in the shipping sector was raised with the UK’s Environmental Audit Committee through oral evidence given by Larkin \(then Bows\). Published research papers **\[1, 2, 3\]** and stakeholder engagement at industry and policy events further highlighted the scale of the challenge. This culminated in a submission and oral presentation on carbon budgets made by Larkin and Smith \(UCL\) to the International Maritime Organisation at their Marine Environmental Protection Committee meeting MEPC68 in summer 2015. Smith spoke predominantly about techno\-economic potential in the sector, Larkin focussing on emissions consequences. 

 Tyndall\-Manchester’s research has led the debates that informed European policy decisions and contributed to global scale impact. The European Commission Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety \(ENVI\) in 2016 proposed a new chapter to Directive 2003/87/EC that would include shipping within its Emissions Trading Scheme if not otherwise regulated. This put pressure on the IMO **\[A\]**. This decision was informed by European Commission Policy Department A for the ENVI Committee report **\[A\]** citing paper **\[1\]** for evidence around targets for aviation and shipping. The international NGO  [Global Commission on the Economy and Climate](http://newclimateeconomy.net/about/members-global-commission/), led by the former President of Mexico Felipe Calderon, produced a report **\[B\]** which cites Tyndall\-Manchester’s paper’s ‘50% cut in CO<sub>2</sub> by 2050’, and their *Nature Climate Change* commentary **\[2\]**, with a recommendation that “ *the IMO adopts a global emission reduction target for international shipping…in keeping with 2 °C”*. 

 Larkin spoke prominently on shipping at both the 2015 and 2017 UN international climate negotiations \(COP21 and COP23\), including at an official EU side event alongside Tony De Brum from the Marshall Islands – the leader of the High Ambition Coalition **\[C\]**. At COP21, sector\-specific NGOs cited Tyndall\-Manchester’s research in applying pressure to civil servants and political representatives **\[D\]** and by 2017, there was pressure also from *within* the industry fearing that if IMO did not set a target, the EU would do so instead. The link between UoM’s research and these ongoing policy changes is evidenced by citations of research finding 2 \(above\) in EU **\[A\]**, Pacific Nations’ policy development background documents **\[E\]**, and IMO internal newsletters **\[F\]** at relevant points in time. 

###  Impact – Shipping 

 The UN body responsible for regulating shipping, the International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\), adopted ambitious climate change targets at the MEPC72 meeting in April 2018 with preceding discourse influenced directly by Tyndall\-Manchester research **\[D, G\]**. The IMO estimate the resulting emissions reduction to be between 800 and 2,400 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2050, which is greater than preventing all emissions from fossil fuels currently burnt in Germany. The international NGO Transport & Environment’s Campaign Director summarises UoM’s research and evidence contributions, saying, “ *…this work was instrumental in the IMO adopting global emissions reduction targets for international shipping*” **\[D\]**. 

 Action to reduce emissions from shipping is necessary for comprehensive climate change mitigation. If this sector is excluded from obligations applicable to other sectors, then it is much less likely that global warming will be limited to 1.5 °C;  the IPCC identify that up to several hundred million people would be exposed to additional climate related risks and poverty by 2050 compared to 2 °C \(IPCC 2018 SPM B5.1\). The UK Chamber of Shipping’s Director of Policy emphasised the importance of the IMO’s adoption of these targets, saying, “ *This is not only vital work for our industry but also critical in helping to ensure shipping meets its climate change obligations which will be key to the wider global strategy*” **\[G\]**. The reach of Tyndall\-Manchester’s impact on the shipping sector is global due to the adoption of an international 2050 emissions reduction target by the IMO **\[G\]**. 

###  Pathways to Impact – Aviation 

 Based on research findings 2 and 3 \(above\), Broderick and Larkin submitted evidence to the DfT development of the 2019 Aviation White Paper and an expert statement to the judicial review of the approval for the development of plans for a new runway at Heathrow Airport \(Airports National Policy Statement \(ANPS\) 2018\) **\[H\]**. 

 Broderick and colleagues also held a series of workshops \(November 2017 to March 2018\) with the Assistant Director \(Environment\) of Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\), representatives of Manchester Airport Group and other stakeholders. The conclusions from these workshops were widely circulated in a report advising GMCA to account for the impact of international transport within their own climate change mitigation framework. Prior to this work, aviation had been considered outside of the city scale, however Tyndall\-Manchester’s research showed that DfT national aviation forecasts resulted in too high a mitigation burden for the GM city\-region. The researchers proposed a new emissions pathway for aviation that was presented to the GMCA Low Carbon Hub board, and as a keynote presentation at Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham’s Green Summit in March 2018. This was followed up with further research and workshops in late 2019 and early 2020 culminating in a report and presentations to Manchester Climate Change Partnership. 

###  Impact – Aviation 

 The reach of the impact on UK aviation policy is at two levels. The first level is the acknowledgement of the comparative scale of DfT forecasts in relation to Paris Agreement carbon budgets. This was particularly highlighted in relation to Heathrow expansion. Following Larkin’s statement **\[H\]**, during the Judicial Review of the ANPS \(2018\), the Court of Appeal in February 2020 ruled that the Government’s ANPS was unlawful because it failed to take into account the UK’s commitment to the Paris Agreement. As of February 2021, Heathrow Airport acknowledge they have to prove expansion is compatible with the Paris Agreement before construction could being. 

 The second impact is at the city\-regional level where the research has helped the City of Manchester to understand the implications of unfettered aviation expansion for their own emissions reductions plans. Manchester City Council, which owns a controlling stake \(35%\) of Manchester Airport, formally endorsed the draft Manchester Zero Carbon Framework \(2020\-38\) in March 2019, which contains analysis that is dependent upon Tyndall\-Manchester’s aviation research **\[I\]**. Subsequently \(Nov 2019\) Manchester Climate Change Agency \(MCCA\) commissioned the Tyndall\-Manchester research team to report on policy options for monitoring and managing emissions from Manchester Airport. Without this research MCCA would not have communicated the importance of aviation emissions at city scale to senior policy makers and stakeholders and achieved the formal adoption of targets and actions for aviation within the city’s Climate Change Framework **\[J\]**. The latest Manchester Climate Change Framework 2020\-25 therefore includes new aviation emissions objectives and was subsequently endorsed by Manchester City Council in March 2020, formally establishing it as the city’s climate change strategy.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Bauhaus is the most famous school of art, design and architecture of the 20th century, celebrated for its key role in European and American modernism. ‘bauhaus imaginista’ was a three\-year international research project directed and curated by Grant Watson and Marion von Osten, commissioned to mark the Bauhaus centenary and realised through exhibitions and events in 11 countries. This major international project challenged the European\- and Western\-centric view of Bauhaus history, transforming audience perceptions of the school in Germany, and generating international research collaborations, whose impact has been the rethinking of modernist legacies in contexts including China, Turkey, Nigeria and Britain. Through an extensive series of discursive events in Germany and internationally, a second impact has been to highlight the Bauhaus’s relevance today to education and society, and to cultural appropriation and nationalism. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 ‘bauhaus imaginista’ was a major project by the Bauhaus Kooperation \(Berlin, Weimar, Dessau\), the Goethe Institute and Haus der Kulturen der Welt \(HKW\), Berlin, supported by a €3 million budget from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Federal Cultural Foundation on the occasion of the school’s centenary. It was a collaboration between the artistic directors, Grant Watson \(RCA\) and Marion von Osten \(artist and curator\), who, between 2016 and 2019, contributed a 50/50 share to its intellectual and artistic leadership, each bringing their specific expertise into play. 

 ‘bauhaus imaginista’ commissioned extensive research collaborations and curatorial outputs in Germany, Morocco, China, the United States, Japan, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria, India, Turkey and the United Kingdom. This was a two\-way process, facilitating insights for the project and generating impacts on academic and curatorial practice, as well as public perception, in different parts of the world \(as outlined in section 4.\) 

 As artistic directors, Watson and von Osten devised an overarching curatorial structure, designated lines of research, forged international partnerships, recruited teams in Germany and internationally, and delivered exhibitions and events. The overarching research question concerning Bauhaus internationalism was explored through four sub questions looking at: radical pedagogy; cultural appropriation; design and ideology; and art school experimentation. This was a way to identify particular histories and locations, and break down larger questions of Bauhaus internationalism into specific case studies. Insights gained were exchanged by an extensive network of scholars and practitioners from different disciplines and traditions, many of whom met and formed panels as part of two conferences in Berlin, as well as through the online journal *bauhaus imaginista*. 

 Research undertaken between 2017 and 2019 involved three stages, as follows: **Phase one** \(2017\): site visits to eight international locations by the co\-curators. **Phase two** \(2018\): a series of exhibitions, discursive events and workshops on location in eight different countries, as part of the research process. **Phase three** \(2019\): a large\-scale exhibition, *bauhaus imaginista*, at HKW, Berlin \(3.1\), which subsequently toured to Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern, and SALT, Istanbul; and two conferences, ‘The political imaginista’ and ‘A New School’, also at the HKW. 

 Under Watson’s and co\-curator von Osten’s direction, research was undertaken through collaborations with a team of 30 core researchers, including artists, designers, architects, academics and international partner institutions. These included Le Cube, Rabat; China Design Museum, Hangzhou \(3.2\); Goethe Institute and partners, New York; The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto; Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow; SESC Pompeia, São Paulo; Goethe Institut, Lagos; Kiran Nadar Museum, New Delhi; Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin \(3.1\); Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern; Nottingham Contemporary \(3.3\); and SALT, Istanbul. These partners shared regional expertise, made available material from their collections, co\-funded exhibitions and discursive events, and generated audiences for the research. In many instances, ‘bauhaus imaginista’ facilitated international partners to pursue new lines of research into regional modernism. 

 Overall outputs representing iterations of this project featured: ten exhibitions, locations including Hangzhou, Kyoto, Moscow, São Paulo, New Delhi, Berlin, Bern, Nottingham and Istanbul, as well as a worldwide ‘Collected Research’ tour \(3.4\); nine conferences in Hangzhou, New York, Tokyo, Moscow, São Paulo, Lagos, New Dehli, Berlin and Bern; four publications: *bauhaus imaginista \- A School in the World* \(Thames and Hudson\); ‘ *bauhaus imaginista*: Learning From’ exhibition guide for Sesc Pompeia, São Paulo; ‘ *bauhaus imaginista’* HKW exhibition guide; and the online journal, *bauhaus imaginista* \(3.5, 3.6\). 

 This three\-year research project went through a rigorous and ongoing peer\-review process. The curatorial concept and research trajectory were agreed at a meeting in May 2016, convened by the three commissioning partners, including the heads of each institution as well as international delegates. Co\-curators reported to the three commissioning partners at a quarterly board meeting and presented to international partner institutions prior to each collaboration agreement.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 ‘bauhaus imaginista’ has had significant and wide\-ranging impacts on understanding of international and regional modernisms and of the school’s relevance for contemporary society. Through the project’s international programme of exhibitions, workshops and discursive events, taking place in 11 locations across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, ‘bauhaus imaginista’ was able to change perceptions of the Bauhaus for broad publics internationally. As a result of international collaborations with museums, art institutes, cultural centres and academies of art, design and architecture, the project has also impacted on curatorial practice, perspectives and methods for mediating the Bauhaus legacy. As the Senior Curator of Special Projects in Modern Art at the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, wrote: ‘The range and subtlety with which the legacy has been explored and teased out is fascinating: whether in India at Santinikitan in the late 1920s or Morocco in the 1960s, it opens unexpected avenues of enquiry \[...\] In short, it left me excited for more, and eager to keep thinking about the longevity of this institution so fragile and experimental in its lifetime and yet so enduring in its impact.’ \(5.1\). Key impacts are described below. 

 **China Design Museum, Hangzhou** 

 The exhibition *bauhaus imaginista: Moving Away*, 8 April–26 August 2018, formed part of the inauguration of the $25.35 million China Design Museum \(CDM\) in Hangzhou. This exhibition and symposium focused on design disciplines from the Bauhaus workshops, and how concepts, methods and forms were adapted and transformed in China, India and the Soviet Union. This facilitated a reconceptualising of early 20th\-century modernism as a transnational phenomenon, with an emphasis on a China Bauhaus connection. The *bauhaus imaginista* collaboration impacted on the curatorial work of the CDM and led to subsequent Bauhaus\-related exhibitions at the museum, including *A Face of Second Modernity: The Braun\-Design 1951–1967*, 2019, which included the Ulm School of Design \(5.2\). The Assistant Curator of the CDM states: *‘*One of the most important features of the exhibition \( *bauhaus imaginista*\) is not to study the history of the Bauhaus itself, but to focus on the transformation and acceptance of Bauhaus concepts in non\-European regions. All of us agree that the decentralised research method will be very valuable to China Design Museum for research and curatorial work in the future. We not only understand the importance of Bauhaus history, but also focus on its localisation process in China’ \(5.2\).  *bauhaus imaginista: Moving Away* also put Bauhaus designs and prototypes on display in the context of the Chinese Art Academy \(where the CDM is located\), responding to the museum’s aim to enhance public understanding of the Bauhaus and modernism in Asia, and using Bauhaus design to inform young designers entering the sector. Of the 122,300 people who attended the exhibition during its 12\-week run, the Assistant Director of CDM has stated that 60 per cent were classed as ‘young people’, including students training as industrial designers and architects at the Chinese Art Academy \(5.3\). 

 **Haus der Kulturen de Welt, Berlin** 

 The *bauhaus imaginista* presentation in Germany in the centenary year was at the Haus der Kulturen de Welt, Germany's national centre for international contemporary arts, in Berlin. Here the research was brought together in a large\-scale exhibition featuring exhibits from the locations visited in phase 2, providing a unique opportunity to cross\-reference the transcultural legacy of the Bauhaus from Asia, Africa and the Americas. The Director of the London office of the Munich Institute observed that: ‘The exhibition in Berlin at the HKW was where all the chapters came together, like a big world meeting of all imaginations of Bauhaus \[…\] the effect was a very interesting one as the exhibition didn’t teach about Bauhaus but invited the audience to “learn together” about an interactive Bauhaus, about the interactions of cultures. Bauhaus wasn’t the historic epoch of modern design any more, but a dynamic source for intercultural dialogues *’* \(5.4\). The impact of this exhibition was to transform public understanding of the Bauhaus, which had been tied to German heritage and cultural identity, and broaden it to include an extraordinary network in art, design, architecture and pedagogy. *bauhaus imaginista* reinterpreted modernism as a political multicultural and international movement, as Pablo Larios, senior editor of *Frieze* magazine, noted: ‘ *bauhaus imaginista* tells a different tale, of an intellectual and artistic cosmopolitanism during the interbellum years, in which pedagogy was political and in which the school’s activities in multicultural Weimar resonated with similar reformist educational movements well beyond Germany. This version views the school as a diasporic formation’ \(5.5\). 

 In addition to the historic material on display, *bauhaus imaginista* commissioned seven artists, including the Otolith Group, Wendelien van Oldenborgh, Zwi Efrat, Alice Criescher, Kader Attia, Doreen Mende and Luca Frei, to research how the Bauhaus legacy exists in the present. For example, van Oldenborgh’s film invited urbanists and present\-day inhabitants of buildings by Bauhaus architect Lotta Stam Beese, in Khrakov and Rotterdam, to reflect on the current use of modernist architecture, including questions of housing policy, migrant communities and structural racism. The ‘political imaginista’ conference at the HKW addressed contemporary far\-right populism and xenophobia with reference to the National Socialists’ hostility to the school, as reflected in Iwao Yamawaki’s 1932 collage, *Attack on the Bauhaus*, which featured in the exhibition. The HKW director agreed that *bauhaus imaginista* ‘provided the historical frame through which contemporary urgencies could be addressed’ \(5.6\). The project’s overall impact can also be tracked through its record\-breaking attendance: *bauhaus imaginista* drew some of the largest audience figures ever seen at the HKW – 32,000 visitors, with many reporting that they were first\-time visitors \(5.7\). Further impact was achieved by the production of new audio guides and tours for the partially sighted, in response to the exhibition’s popularity \(5.7\). HKW reported not just large visitor numbers but also evidence of good engagement via social media, and positive feedback. One typical social media post stated: ‘The current show at @hkw is for me the perfect intersection of art and knowledge production. I spent most of the time reading the books they provided and will come back with more time on my hands and a notebook. Perfect environment to get inspired. \#withinexhibitions \#bauhaus \#design \#hkw \#hausderkulturenderwelt \#berlin’ \(5.7\). 

 **Nottingham Contemporary, UK** 

 Nottingham Contemporary’s exhibition *Still Undead: Popular Culture in Britain Beyond the Bauhaus* was the most significant exhibition of the Bauhaus in the UK during the school’s centenary year \(5.8\). Through a collaboration between *bauhaus imaginista* and the Nottingham Contemporary curatorial team, this exhibition explored the little\-known reception and influence of the Bauhaus in the UK during the 1930s, 60s and 80s. The exhibition changed visitor understanding, with audiences expressing surprise and appreciation for this unique account of an alternative history. The Director of Nottingham Contemporary noted: ‘We were very much aware that, 100 years on, most ways of doing an exhibition about the Bauhaus had been done. We had also seen a number of books and exhibitions that had tried to make the claim that the Bauhaus had a real impact in the UK in the 1930s. It felt to us that using the centenary could become a much more generative and idiosyncratic way of asking questions about cultural education today \[...\] In the event, it wound up that this was the largest Bauhaus exhibition in the UK in the centenary year \[…\] We’ve really had a huge response, from mainstream critics and art historians and art critics *’* \(5.8\). 

 The exhibition drew 60,976 visitors during its 16\-week run, making it the fifth most attended exhibition in the gallery’s history. Visitor responses and survey feedback demonstrate its success in presenting a new picture of Bauhaus influence: ‘Its aim was to show the legacy of the Bauhaus in education, art and design in the UK from the 1930s to the 1980s and it certainly succeeded. Although the Bauhaus is perhaps best known for its modernist architecture and iconic furniture, who would have guessed its direct influence on 1960s hairstyling or the teaching of music to primary school children, to name just two of many possible examples? Above all it was informative and fun’ \(5.9\). 

 This new interpretation of Bauhaus was also noted by Will Gompertz in his review of the exhibition for the BBC: ‘\[...\] the curators have served up a very different but utterly compelling show \[...\] It leaves you thinking that is what we need now: a revolutionary approach to art and education. There's no reason it shouldn't start here in the UK. After all, that's where the seeds of the original Bauhaus were sown’ \(5.10\). 

 **Recognising and Preserving Ile Ife Campus, Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria** 

 A specific impact of *bauhaus imaginista* comes in the decision of Obafemi Awolowo University to seek UNESCO World Heritage Site status for its campus buildings designed by Bauhaus architect Arieh Sharon. This follows the *bauhaus imaginista* symposium ‘Decolonising the Campus’, held in Lagos in November 2018, which focussed on the campus architecture and a film commissioned from Zwi Efrat. As the project developer points out: ‘It was entirely due to the *bauhaus imaginista* project that the status of the Ile Ife campus was recognised. It is now considered one of the most interesting Bauhaus sites in the world’ \(5.11\). As a result, the project has received to date a Getty grant of $180,000 \(5.12\) as well as multiple in\-kind donations and commitments from organisations such as the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation towards the UNESCO application. 

 **Further impacts** 

 Through its specific curatorial approach and meaningful collaborations with local partners, *bauhaus imaginista* was able to galvanise research into regional art histories in multiple sites, including in Turkey, where the presentation of *Moving Away* at SALT Istanbul inspired the curatorial team to investigate pioneering approaches in Turkish art and design education, presented in the exhibition *Pedagogical Adaptations in Turkey* \(2020\). As the Director of SALT explains: ‘This multi\-layered research enabled us to look into particular subjects taught, and unique environments formed, at the academy from the 1950s to 1980s. The overall project framework and its methods of questioning the memorised facts of the Bauhaus encouraged this line of research’ \(5.13\). 

 This transcultural approach was also noted by the Director of the London office of the Munich Institute, who observed that in São Paulo, the project’s ‘curatorial strategy had a great impact on the audience \[…\] It was a totally new view on the influence of Bauhaus on local design and – what was even more important – the influence of indigenous and original arts and crafts on the Bauhaus’ \(5.4\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Live Coding is an improvisational way of making and performing electronic music with a computer where the computer code is made visible to the audience. Magnusson’s research and the resulting software \( *ixi lang* in particular\) have transformed the way that live coding can be produced, broadening the landscape of creative practice, opening up the field to non\-specialist users and expanding the diversity of those involved. *ixi lang* has been taken up extensively by live coding artists. Beneficiaries of the software releases, code libraries, workshops, tutorials and performances range from creative practitioners to those new to coding or live coding music, many of whom are women – traditionally considered a minority group in the male\-dominated fields of coding \(in general\) and live coding music \(in particular\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Magnusson designed and directed an AHRC\-funded Live Coding Research Network \(2014\) which has yielded a series of workshops, software releases and tutorials, and the yearly International Conference on Live Coding \( [https://iclc.toplap.org/](https://iclc.toplap.org/)\). As part of his two\-year AHRC Leadership Fellowship, Magnusson ran open symposia on new music, for example, the Musical Organics symposium at STEIM \( [http://www.sonicwriting.org/steim.html](http://www.sonicwriting.org/steim.html)\) and the New Notations symposium at IRCAM \( [http://www.sonicwriting.org/ircam.html](http://www.sonicwriting.org/ircam.html)\). These public events were both part of the research and also contributed to further practice\-based and theoretical research. 

 As part of this AHRC\-funded research \[G1\] Magnusson has developed and distributed three live coding systems: *ixi lang Qt* \[R1\], and more recently *Threnoscope* \[R2\] and *Sema* \[R3\]. A simple way to encode music, *ixi lang* is a notational live coding language that focuses on speedy input, redesign, re\-evaluation, manipulation of coders’ scores and the routing of coders’ output through eﬀects. *Threnoscope* is a live coding system focused on three key areas of music: spatial sound, timbre and texture, and tunings and scales \[R2\]. *Sema,* developed by Magnusson and his team in Sussex’s Experimental Music Technologies Lab \( [www.emutelab.org](http://www.emutelab.org/)\), as part of the MIMIC \(Musically Intelligent Machines Interacting Creatively\) project allows non\-programmers to create their own live coding languages for machine learning \[R3\] \[G3\]. Since *Sema*’s launch in May 2020, Magnusson has been active in fostering a user community around the *Sema* system for language design for machine learning \( [http://www.sema.codes](http://www.sema.codes/)\). Through public facing workshops, including 200 international participants in an online workshop in summer 2020, the system is gaining popular usage across the globe. Together the *ixi lang,* *Threnoscope* and *Sema* live coding systems represent a paradigm shift in live coding practice, opening it up for the use of Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) as part of realtime performance, and enabling people to design their own languages for personal expression, rather than being restricted by the structures of established systems. 

 This practice\-based research on live coding systems has been informed by Magnusson’s AHRC funded investigation into the role of technology in musical expression \[G2\]. His monograph, *Sonic Writing* \(2019\) \[R4\] theoretically underpins these new technological developments. The book describes the profound effect of new digital music technologies on musical expression, exploring how new computational technologies, including machine learning, are transforming our musical practices. Magnusson provides a conceptual framework for the creation and analysis of new musical work, grounding digital musical practices in historical instances of technological adaptation and new instrument design. *Sonic Writing* introduced the notion of ‘new systematicity’ as a trend in contemporary musical practice where the focus moves from the piece to a system generating infinite versions of the music. The research was disseminated through hands\-on involvement with professional and amateur musicians through international workshops, symposia, and performance, for example, teaching live coding at the influential Darmstadt Summer School of New Music \(2018\). This theoretical contribution is extended through articles in journals such as *Tempo* \[R5\] and *Journal of New Music Research* \[R6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Magnusson’s research has transformed the way music is produced by changing and shaping coding practices and creative practitioner communities nationally and internationally. Magnusson’s live coding systems, particularly *ixi lang*, have both contributed to technical innovation in music practice, and respond to live coding’s ‘diversity problem’, enabling access for new users including non\-programmers and women who are, due to ‘a significant imbalance in gender’ in the wider coding community and in ‘music technology’ in particular, traditionally an underrepresented group \(Shelly Knotts, e.g.  [https://youtu.be/PboSZGllzsU](https://youtu.be/PboSZGllzsU)\). 

 **Contribution to technical innovation in musical practice** 

 Magnusson’s research has been pivotal in furthering technical innovation in the field of live coding, by providing the foundations and ‘inspiration’ \[S1, p. 173\]\] for other systems. Since 2019, *ixi lang* has been integrated into the most widely used live coding system \[S2\], Sonic Pi \( [https://sonic\-pi.net/](https://sonic-pi.net/)\). Sonic Pi was initially designed to reduce ‘barriers to \[…\] coding and is used in both educational settings and by professional performers, composers, musicians’ \[S3\], and has been downloaded more than a million times \[S4\]. Even before its integration into this influential system, *ixi lang* was, as Sonic Pi’s creator Sam Aaron notes, ‘a large influence \[on Sonic Pi\] with respect to \[ *ixi lang’s*\] simple uncluttered syntax and tight relationship between visible syntax and sound’ \[S5 p.7\]. 

 Magnusson’s research, shared in workshops such as the one held at STEIM, has been instrumental in further technological innovations. According to \[text removed for publication\], Magnusson’s research ‘had a major beneficial impact on the commercialisation of Bela, an open source platform for creating musical instruments.’ \[S6\] The open source nature of Magnusson’s software means it is impossible to trace all of the many developer iterations of *ixi lang*, but some of the most prominent include WulfCode \[S7\] and Atomiix from Rumblesan \[S8\]. 

 **Changing music practice amongst industry professionals** 

 Magnusson’s Live Coding Research Network, the resulting software, workshops, talks and training, as well as live coding conferences \( [https://iclc.toplap.org/](https://iclc.toplap.org/)\) in Ireland, Spain, Mexico, Canada and the UK, have shaped networks of pioneering practitioners across the globe and been influential in the development of live coding and the culture and community of Algorave \( [https://algorave.com/](https://algorave.com/)\) – a dance party in which ‘DJs’ live code music and the audience watches the code projected behind them. *ixi lang* is widely used internationally by a diverse range of Algorave artists including UK\-based Belisha Beacon \[S9\] and Deerful \[S10\]. 

 Jesús Jara López, cultural programmer of the Media Lab Prado \(Madrid\) directly accredits Magnusson with initiating profound shifts in music practice. Magnusson’s workshops in Spain, he suggests, ‘show\[ed\] musicians new ways of making music … \[T\]hat was a big change because people were used to thinking that only professionals could make electronic music… \[it\] was game\-changing’ \[S11\] 

 Other practitioners have described how the system opened up a new world of musical expression to them. Ash Sagar, digital sonic artist, notes, ‘ *ixi lang* was a way for me to use the computer as a musical instrument. It provided a high\-level entry into making live music with computer code’ \[S12\]. Dorien Schampert, who performs as Algorave artist Beacon, talks about how *ixi lang* ‘facilitates improvisation and has helped me get over my perfectionism \[…\] It has kick\-started a new chapter in my music career’ \[S13\]. 

 **Opening up live coding to non coders and to underrepresented groups** 

 Magnusson’s live coding systems and tutorials have been recognized as an ideal educational tool and invaluable for getting non\-programmers started on their path to mastering computer programming and those with knowledge of music on the path to live coding music. Sam Aaron, of Sonic Pi fame, notes that *ixi lang* ‘allows people to take first steps in coding who wouldn’t do so otherwise, which is why it works as a “first contact” experience of live coding.’ \[S3\] 

 Shelly Knotts, a specialist in teaching live coding to women and children in a range of settings, including the Montreal Arts Festival and the National Media Museum in Bradford, also notes *ixi lang*’s suitability ‘for people who’ve never done live coding.’ \[S14\] Through Yorkshire Sound Women Network \(YSWN\) \( [https://yorkshiresoundwomen.com/](https://yorkshiresoundwomen.com/)\), a network for women interested in music technology, Knotts ran a workshop for 20 female participants, some of whom were ‘non coders with knowledge of music’ and others who had ‘knowledge of computer code’ in December 2015, designed to introduce them to *ixi lang* \( [https://youtu.be/PboSZGllzsU](https://youtu.be/PboSZGllzsU)\). One attendee – Schampert, mentioned above – has gone on to perform as Belisha Beacon, a live coding artist in the Algorave scene \[S9\]. In an article for *Mixmag*, the electronic music and clubbing magazine, the journalist Isabelle Bolt described a women\-only live coding workshop that used *ixi lang*, praising its useability for an inexperienced coder \[S15\]. Similar observations were made by a female interviewee and noted in an article by Joanne Armitage in *Dancecult: The Journal of Electronic Dance and Music Culture* \[S16\]. 

 As well as inspiring and shaping new live coding systems and communities amongst creative practitioner professionals in the UK and internationally, Magnusson’s ‘intuitive’ \[S13\] *ixi lang* has made live coding accessible to non\-programmers, democratising this skill, and thereby transforming the field.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Over GBP4 billion of low carbon electricity generation was directly underpinned by the University of Bristol’s award\-winning earthquake shaking table experiments on an innovative ¼\-scale model of a cracked Advanced Gas\-cooled Reactor \(AGR\) graphite core. Without this research, the UK’s 14 AGRs \(contributing 14% of the UK’s electricity supply\) would not be operating beyond the onset of cracking in their graphite cores. The research enabled EDF to present successful seismic safety cases to the Office for Nuclear Regulation, resulting in safe\-life extensions of the 8 oldest reactors, from 2016 to 2022. Atkins improved and validated their modelling capability upon which the safety cases depend. EDF’s improved safe\-life projection of the AGR fleet aids planning of the UK’s electricity security and renewal. International industry and public awareness were raised through three prestigious industry awards and a stand at the 2019 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Advanced Gas\-cooled Reactors \(AGRs\) are unique to the UK. Radiation\-driven ageing leads to a loss of mass, geometric distortions, and cracks in the reactor core’s graphite lattice bricks. The cores of the 14 reactors \(Fig. 1\) in the UK’s seven\-station AGR fleet are gradually cracking in accordance with anticipated mechanisms. For continued operation, EDF must demonstrate that this cracking does not affect the safe shutdown of a reactor following an earthquake. The unique research challenge was to create and shake a meaningful physical model of an AGR’s aged graphite core \(Fig. 2\) to validate the computational methodology \(known as GCORE\) that is used to assess the seismic safety of a reactor when subjected to a 1\-in\-10,000\-year UK earthquake \(equivalent to about a Magnitude 6.2 event\). The GCORE numerical model is developed and run by EDF’s consulting engineers, Atkins, who were partners in the validation research alongside EDF. 

 A reactor core consists of a 3D array of thousands of graphite moderator bricks loosely interconnected through a graphite keying system that constrains relative motion between bricks, whilst allowing small movements due to thermal and nuclear radiation effects \(Fig. 3a and b\). Vertical columns of hollow, 16\-sided, lattice bricks accommodate the nuclear fuel rods. The interstices between the lattice bricks are filled by columns of smaller hollow rectangular bricks, which accommodate the control rods. The lattice and interstitial bricks are loosely connected through thin rectangular graphite keys that are free to move in the vertical keyway slots machined into the lattice bricks. The keying system allows the c40,000\-component graphite array to expand and contract uniformly in all directions. 

 Cracks mainly emanate from the lattice brick keyways. Bricks usually crack vertically into two, three or four segments \(Fig. 4\). Others develop single vertical cracks. Cracking increases the dynamic flexibility of the graphite core, which affects its seismic response. Crucially, excessive distortions of the interstitial columns might prevent insertion of the control rods needed to shut down the reactor. This is a truly complex, non\-linear structural dynamics problem, with the principal non\-linear mechanisms being the rocking, impact, and contact dynamics between the graphite components.

 Physical testing of a real core is impossible. Physical scale modelling was the only alternative empirical validation approach \[1\]. The University’s 7\-year, GBP6.95 million research programme \[i\] developed an innovative, complex, high precision, ¼\-scale physical model of a representative AGR graphite core assembly that could accommodate a wide range of structurally degraded core configurations. The model was made from Acetal plastic and was shaken on the six\-axis EPSRC Earthquake Simulator \(shaking table\) in the University’s engineering laboratories \(Fig. 5\). 

 The bespoke physical model contained over 40,000 components and 3,200 sensors in a package measuring approximately 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.0m and weighing 8t. The rig development involved integration of high precision structural engineering and manufacturing, innovative electronic sensor development, and cutting\-edge data analysis and experimental techniques \[2, 3\]. Fig. 6 shows a typical, miniaturised, 32\-channel sensor conditioning and data acquisition package \(equivalent to three conventional 19\-inch\-wide electronics racks\) designed to fit inside the model bricks.  Twelve model cores were shaken with hundreds of simulated earthquakes, producing c20 TB of data that revealed important insights into an aged graphite core's non\-linear seismic behaviour and integrity \[4\].

 EDF determines whether a plant is safe to operate; its safety case must prove this to the Office for Nuclear Regulation \(ONR\) to gain a licence instrument that permits operation of a reactor. EDF’s safety case must prove that sufficient control rods can be inserted to shut down a reactor safely after a 1\-in\-10,000\-year seismic event, otherwise ONR will not issue a licence instrument and the reactor will have to close permanently, as repair or improvement of the graphite core are impossible \[A\]. 

 Data from the University of Bristol physical model \[4\] were used by EDF and Atkins to validate the GCORE numerical modelling methodology. Significant improvements to the numerical models were identified, covering issues such as damping, friction and the structural actions of particular keys and cracked brick patterns. Convergence between the numerical and physical models was greatly improved to the point where the ONR accepted the evidence from them \[B\]. Hunterston B Reactor 4 gained the latest ONR re\-start approval in September 2020 \[B\]. 

 The Chief Technical Officer of EDF described the principal impacts as follows \[A\]: 

 “*The reliable and justified operation of the UK’s fleet of Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors \(AGR\) depends upon the physical plant condition and the maintenance of a valid safety case. The graphite core ages and degrades due to the fast neutron irradiation and radiolytic oxidation. Graphite cores cannot be repaired or replaced, therefore understanding these changes, and their consequences, is important to setting the safe operational life of the graphite cores, which are expected to be a life limiting feature of the current fleet of AGRs.* 

 *The University of Bristol and EDF have been partners on the Graphite Seismic Validation experiment since 2013. Analysis shows that the graphite cores are very tolerant to widespread cracking of the bricks. However, there was no experimental evidence available and, hence, the requirement to build, shake and analyse a scale model of the graphite core…* 

 *…The experiments devised and completed by the team at the University have been providing rigorous, highly innovative, and original validation of the computational models built to underwrite the seismic qualification of the AGR fleet. The University assembled a multi\-disciplinary team to work on the programme since not only did it require the right seismic physics to scale the behaviour of the full AGR core to the ¼\-scale model, it required the development and use of novel techniques, involving specially designed miniaturised data acquisition hardware, to capture and process the many thousands of transducer signals needed to provide measures of the brick displacements during the excitations.* 

 *The experiment showed that the computer models over\-predicted the movements of the model bricks and enabled the reasons to be identified. This experiment successfully showed that the computer models of the AGR cores are conservative and that the predicted safety margins are appropriate to support continued operation.* 

 *Without this research the UKs fleet of 14 AGRs would not be operating past the onset of keyway root cracking in the graphite core. Hunterston and Hinkley Point B would have shut in 2018 and Hartlepool and Heysham 1 reactors would be likely to shut in 2021. The research has directly supported over GBP4 billion \(13TWd\) of generation \[to July 2020\]. This is up to 14% of the UK’s electricity supply at any given time, and directly supports thousands of jobs in the UK, Europe, and the wider international supply chain.* 

 *The experiment has been an excellent ambassador for the University of Bristol and EDF. Tours of the University laboratory have been regularly conducted to engage stakeholders ranging from the student body, members of the public, the Office for Nuclear Regulation and all levels of EDF staff from across Europe. The experiment has supported one EDF\-funded PhD and multiple undergraduate projects. The experiment was deemed suitably original to be presented at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in 2019…* 

 *…The experiment would not have been as successful without the commitment and professionalism of the team at the University of Bristol, EDF are very grateful and proud of the team’s achievements*.” 

#  Informing future UK electricity security and EDF’s commercial strategy: 

 In the UK, EDF currently has 9008 MW of low carbon nuclear generation capacity \(including Sizewell B\), and 3332 MW of coal and gas fired generation \(West Burton A & B\). Given the improved understanding of the AGR fleet’s seismic integrity that the research has established, EDF’s expected AGR station extended closure dates are now as follows \[C\]: 

|#  **AGR station** |#  **Generating capacity \(MW\)** |#  **Generationstarted** |#  **Originallyscheduledclosure** |#  **Expected closure afterextension** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heysham 1 | 1155 | 1983 | 2014 | 2024 |
| Hartlepool | 1185 | 1983 | 2014 | 2024 |
| Hunterston B | 965 | 1976 | 2016 | 2022 |
| Hinkley Point B | 965 | 1976 | 2016 | 2022 |
| Dungeness B | 1120 | 1983 | 2018 | 2028 |
| Heysham 2 | 1230 | 1988 | 2023 | 2030 |
| Torness | 1190 | 1988 | 2023 | 2030 |
| *Total* | *7810* ||||

 Confidence in the above closure dates is crucial for EDF’s long\-term business and financial planning. It is also crucial for planning the security and renewal of the UK’s future low\-carbon electricity supply capacity, noting that the UK’s gross electricity capacity margin is c20\-30% \(7% derated\) \[D\] and the AGRs contribute up to 14% of the UK’s current generating capacity \[A\] \(Sizewell B, not an AGR, adds a further c4%**Footnote:**

\). 

#  Capacity building for consultant R&D: 

 Atkins, a global consultancy, are EDF’s consulting engineers responsible for developing and running the GCORE numerical model of the seismic response of AGRs. Atkins benefitted from their partnership with the University of Bristol in several ways \[E\]: 

-  A strengthened relationship with EDF due to the validation of GCORE. 

-  The experimental validation robustly substantiated the modelling technique, which Atkins can in future apply to model dynamic simulation problems efficiently in a range of other situations, improving model fidelity and offering significantly better computational performance and efficiency. 

-  The opportunity to collaborate with the University of Bristol also gave the Atkins team insight into state\-of\-the\-art seismic testing, which widens the range of options they are able to consider for other seismic analyses. 

-  Development opportunities for more than 10 engineers since 2015, building technical capability in areas such as seismic analysis, data processing and programming. 

-  Valuable practical experience for early career engineers through supporting testing campaigns and laboratory\-based work. 

#  Industry and Public Engagement Impacts: 

 The project successfully raised the awareness of wider industry and the general public \(particularly young people\) of the nature and importance of the AGR seismic safety assessment challenge, and of the rigour, inventiveness, broader applications and career opportunities in the world leading, multidisciplinary, research and engineering that underpins the solution. 

 In addition to the EDF Innovation Team of the Year prize 2014, the project won two prestigious national industry awards: the ICE SW Region Showcase Award 2017 \[F\], and The Engineer: Collaborate to Innovate Academic Innovator Award 2018 \[G\], both generating international publicity. 

 The project was selected for the Royal Society’s 2019 Summer Science Exhibition \[H\]. The project’s ‘The Great Bristol Shake Off’ stand included interactive learning exhibits culminating in a game for visitors to show what they had learned about earthquake engineering by designing and building their own version of a nuclear power station building and then shaking it to destruction using a mini shaking table. The exhibition was attended by 12,653 students, teachers, members of the public, science and industry leaders, and national politicians \[H\]. The stand led to online news articles on the Institution of Mechanical Engineers \[I\] and Geographical Magazine \[J\] websites, and it generated much positive audience feedback \[H\], e.g.: 

-  “*Best: application\! Are UK nuclear reactors safe? Knowing that work is being done to ensure safety of UK population*.” 

-  “*Earthquake simulator is impressive and illustrates how the technology developed for the project works. Building your own pieces of architecture makes it more interactive. The touch screen contains lots of information*.” 

-  “*The earthquake simulator was a highlight, the objectives of the project were clearly explained and related to daily life \(energy source\)*.” 

-  “*Jim from their team was excellent at explaining both the pure science and the industry application. Their “earthquake” experiments were excellent hooks which gave some foundational knowledge for understanding their nuclear reactor project*.” 

-  “*Long engaging conversation with academic on their research. Showed how building can be safeguarded. What is involved in the numerical model – machine learning*.” 

-  “*Everything worked and the game was well thought\-out and attracted a lot of attention*.”

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Preeclampsia is a potentially serious condition experienced by between 3% and 6% of pregnant women. It is characterised by high blood pressure \(associated possible organ damage\), higher risks of preterm birth, stillbirth and maternal death.  Research designed and conducted by Professor Wright has developed algorithms that combine the use of biomarkers and maternal factors at 1st trimester screening to identify women at high risk of preterm preeclampsia. Use of these algorithms has been adopted widely by obstetricians and gynaecologists in the UK and internationally, with an estimated **9.4 million 1<sup>st</sup> trimester screens \(1.3%\) using the algorithm** since 2016. In addition, a clinical trial conducted by Professor Wright has demonstrated that low\-dose aspirin can reduce the risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth and the related costs associated with neonatal intensive care \(estimated **49,000 cases of preeclampsia prevented** by the end of 2020, with global healthcare **savings of about $3.2 billion**\). This cost\-effective treatment has also been rapidly **adopted in international clinical guidelines** for obstetric care. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Dave Wright is a medical statistician who has developed various analytical methods for creating statistical algorithms that allow more accurate antenatal prediction of conditions and birth defects \(e.g. Down’s Syndrome\).  Since joining the University of Exeter \(in 2014\), most of his research has focused on studies to predict and prevent preeclampsia which, along with other health impacts, is a key risk factor for pre\-term births. 

 Professor Wright was the statistician on two large international collaborative studies which have clearly demonstrated two key findings: 

1.  Collection and analysis of biomarkers and maternal factors at 1<sup>st</sup> trimester screening can effectively identify women at high risk of preterm preeclampsia \(SPREE study\) **\[3.1\].** 

1.  Taking low\-dose aspirin in such high\-risk pregnancies reduces the risk of preterm births by about two thirds \(from 4.3% to 1.6%\) \(ASPRE randomised trial\). 

 **2.1. Analysis of patient and clinical datasets to develop predictive models for screening** 

 In an initial study **\[3.2\]**, Wright and others used data from over 35,000 pregnancies at two UK hospitals to develop a competing risks model that was able to predict 75% \(95% confidence interval 70\-80%\) of preterm preeclampsia, with a false positive rate of only 10%.  These prediction models, that make use of biomarker data, almost doubled the pre\-term preeclampsia detection rate compared with using maternal factors and medical history alone. This result, and the underlying predictive model, has been subsequently validated in two other large data sets **\[3.3\]** 

 **2.2. Effectiveness trial to prevent preeclampsia** 

 In the international ASPRE study, conducted from 2014 to 2016, 1,776 women at high risk for pre\-eclampsia based on first\-trimester combined screening were randomised to either low\-dose aspirin \(150 mg daily\) or placebo, from 11–14 weeks to 36 weeks’ gestation **\[3.4, 3.5\]**. Professor Wright led the design of the study’s statistical analysis and the dose of 150 mg was selected in line with evidence that a significant proportion \(10–30%\) of patients show aspirin resistance at higher doses. The ASPRE trial found that aspirin reduced the risk for preeclampsia before 37 weeks by 62% \(from 4.3% to 1.6%\). Aspirin also reduced the risk of preeclampsia before 34 weeks by 82%, but this effect did not reach statistical significance due to the low absolute rates \(0.4% vs 1.8%\). The beneficial effect of aspirin appeared to depend on the degree of compliance, with the greatest risk reduction observed in women with compliance ≥90%. 

 Further research, based on the ASPRE trial, showed a reduction in the proportion of babies born before 32 weeks from 2.9% in the placebo group to 1.2% in the aspirin group. Of those admitted to the neonatal intensive care ward, the mean length of stay decreased by an average of 20 days and, overall, there was a reduction in length of stay of 68% \(95% confidence interval, 20 \- 86%\) **\[3.6\].** 

 While Professor Wright has been the only Exeter researcher closely involved in this international collaborative research, he has played a pivotal role in their design, conduct and the dissemination of their findings \(evidenced by first and second authorship on all the key academic publications\). He developed the risk prediction algorithm used for the ASPRE and SPREE trial.  He was the trial statistician for ASPRE and for the SPREE study with a key role in the original funding applications, study design, monitoring and the production of papers and other outputs from these studies.  He has engaged with the diagnostic test companies \(PerkinElmer, Thermo Fisher and GE\) to facilitate implementation of prediction and prevention of preeclampsia worldwide.  He is working with groups in Europe, the USA and Asia on implementation of these prediction and prevention strategies.  Prior to the Covid 19 pandemic, he has been funded to visit Denmark, China, US and Israel to present his work at major scientific meetings and to support the implementation of prediction and prevention of preeclampsia.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Preeclampsia is a potentially serious condition experienced during pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and associated possible organ damage. It affects up to 6% of pregnancies in the UK. In severe cases the health consequences for the pregnant woman can be fits \(eclampsia\), liver and blood clotting problems. In severe cases the consequences for the unborn child include pre\-term birth \(with associated complications such as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome\), and a higher risk of stillbirth \(death of baby after 24 weeks of completed pregnancy\). Pre\-term births, in turn, lead to increased risks of life\-long impairments and physical and mental disabilities. In low‐ and middle‐income countries it is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. 

 Professor Wright’s research on algorithms to predict, and the randomised trial of treatments to prevent preeclampsia, have led to decisive changes in clinical practice, and guidelines nationally and internationally. 

 **4.1. Changing national clinical guidelines and practice** 

 Evidence\-based guidance on hypertension in pregnancy for the NHS in England and Wales was produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) in June 2019 \(Guideline NG133\) **\[5.1\]**.  In section 1.1 \(Reducing the risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy\), recommendation 1.1.2 is “Advise pregnant women at high risk of pre\-eclampsia to take 75–150 mg of aspirin daily from 12 weeks until the birth of the baby”, and recommendation 1.1.3 is “Advise pregnant women with more than 1 moderate risk factor for pre\-eclampsia to take 75–150 mg of aspirin daily from 12 weeks until the birth of the baby.” The ASPRE trial is the only randomised trial to have shown the effectiveness and safety of low\-dose aspirin in this patient group, and the NICE Guidance further states that “this use \[of low\-dose aspirin\] is common in UK clinical practice” \(p.37\). As a result of the changes in guidelines, NHS clinicians have changed practice, as evidenced by testimonial **5.2;** ‘ *the research of Professor Wright has had a clinically significant impact on changing our main health policy approach to tackle the problem of preeclampsia’*. 

 **4.2. Changing international clinical guidelines** 

 In 2018, both major international guidelines in this clinical field, from FIGO \( *International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics*\) **\[5.3\]** and ISUOG \( *International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology*\) **\[5.4\]**, changed their recommendations on screening for and treating preterm preeclampsia, directly citing both the risk prediction modelling and the ASPRE trial research findings by Wright as the basis for these changes. The research findings and recommendations have also been directly reflected in the 2019 ACOG guidelines \( *American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists*\) **\[5.5\]**. 

 **4.3. Changing the practice of obstetricians and gynaecologists internationally** 

 As a direct result of the change in international clinical guidelines, screening for preeclampsia based on the FIGO and ISUOG guidance has been initiated in Asia, Australia, Europe and the US **\[5.6\]**. The screening algorithms make use of biochemical tests \(of Placental Growth Factor\), and the global company which manufactures and sells these tests \( *PerkinElmer\)* also has Professor Wright’s pre\-eclampsia risk prediction algorithms built into their own preeclampsia screening software **\[5.7\]**. *PerkinElmer* data demonstrates that the number of women receiving 1<sup>st</sup> trimester screening for preeclampsia has increased from 910,000 in 2017 to 2.6 million in 2019, following publication of the two key studies, and the resulting changes in international clinical guidelines \(ISUOG 2018, FIGO 2019\) \( **Table 1**\). The estimate for 2020 is that 3.67 million trimester screens will use the algorithm, benefitting 2.6% of global pregnancies **\[5.7\].**

 **Table 1.** Perkin\-Elmer data on the supply of biochemical test kits by three companies. 

 The Vice President for Market Development for the Reproductive Health Business of PerkinElmer Inc further stated: “ *The top 6 countries today for PerkinElmer \[placental growth factor\] Kit sales are Canada Russian Federation, China, South Korea, Australia and India. … The algorithm developed by Prof Wright is very flexible, enabling widespread adoption by High Income Countries and Low\-Middle\-Income Countries \(LMIC\).  It is possible to screen for pre\-term \[preeclampsia\] at the simplest level by utilising maternal history and blood pressure only, both of which are readily available in LMIC”.* \(page 1 of source **5.7**\). 

 First\-trimester screening and intervention with aspirin is cost\-effective, combining the prevention of a significant proportion of early\-onset cases of preeclampsia with cost savings to health systems \(Ortved et al 2018, **\[5.8\]**\) For the NHS in England and Wales, combining the ASPRE trial outcome data on mean length of stay in neonatal intensive care \(mean reduction of 1.4 days, NHS cost per day in intensive care £1,513 **\[5.9, 5.10\]**\) with the estimated proportion of pregnant mothers screened as high risk \(10% = 65,000 pregnancies per year **\[5.11\]**\), suggests that after deducting the cost of taking aspirin during pregnancy \(£14 per 25 week course\) this treatment would yield estimated net NHS savings across all affected births in England and Wales of about £130 million per year \(estimated for 2019\). 

 Globally, the estimated healthcare cost savings are far larger. An analysis by *PerkinElmer*’s marketing department estimates an increase in global healthcare cost savings from $301 million to $1,392 million between 2017 and 2020, again assuming that the 10% of pregnancies identified as high risk take low\-dose aspirin \( **Table 2** from evidence **5.7**\). By the end of 2020 they estimate that 49,400 cases of preeclampsia will have been prevented due to the screening and aspirin treatment introduced as a result of Professor Wright’s research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Trauma Informed Care \(TIC\) is an approach to integrated health and social care that aims to facilitate service users’ recovery without re\-traumatisation. The approach is relatively new to the UK, and embedding TIC within large organisations such as the National Health Service \(NHS\) is challenging. Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys \(TEWV\) NHS Foundation Trust, a UK pioneer in the adoption of TIC, used Northumbria’s research into complex system modelling in their implementation strategy. As a result, national guidelines for TIC were developed, and TIC was included in the national NHS Long Term Plan \(2019\). A digital Consensus Tool developed by Northumbria led to improved practitioner knowledge of TIC, and strengthened a community of practice. Another digital tool developed by Northumbria, the Wellbeing Diary, was used by the TEWV Trust to assess a new intervention that was offered to healthcare workers and the public during the COVID\-19 pandemic. The Wellbeing Diary allowed the TEWV Trust to evidence a statistically significant impact of the intervention, helping them to prioritise strategic directions for the organisation.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Northumbria Social Computing \(NorSC\) research group explores human\-centred aspects of computer science. One strand of NorSC’s work, led by Dr Petia Sice, focuses on modelling social systems using a complex systems approach. This investigates how relationships between a system’s parts influence the behaviour of the system as a whole \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 Organisations may be understood as complex and dynamic systems containing social networks of interactions, where importance is put on the relationships between people, as well as on the actions of individuals \[ **R2**\]. Sice investigated how individuals’ attitudes and actions towards information handling emerges within organisations. Her work showed that positive changes in this information behaviour may be achieved through improvements to the environment or infrastructure within which this information is used and processed \[ **R2**\]. Sice’s research also examined nodes and connections in the context of information behaviour, and how the quality of interactions at these points is affected by organisational culture \[ **R1**\]. 

 In 2016, through working on a wellbeing project with blue light services, Sice was introduced to the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys \(TEWV\) NHS Foundation Trust. Angela Kennedy, TIC Lead at the Trust, approached Sice to apply her modelling of social systems research \[ **R2**, **R3**\] to help the Trust introduce a new approach to mental health services – Trauma Informed Care \(TIC\). Within the mental health service, those who experience trauma are often pathologised, i.e., seen as ‘people with the problem’. TIC is an approach that aims to address this view through the creation of safe, open, and trusting environments to facilitate the healing of emotional wounds left by trauma. While individual clinicians and organisations in the UK had previously used TIC in their practice, there was no nationwide guidance explaining TIC or how it could be implemented service\-wide. 

 Northumbria’s work on modelling social systems \[ **R1**\- **R3**\] was used to create a protocol for a nationwide summit for UK clinicians who used TIC in their practice, which was held in March 2019. The summit aimed to identify the main principles of TIC from the experiences and observations of clinicians, service workers, and people with lived experience of trauma. Using information sharing between all participants and an open narrative enquiry method, which allows information to be filtered until consensus is reached, the summit successfully identified key principles of TIC on which all participants agreed. These principles were further refined at a follow\-up workshop in July 2019, enabling them to be used for policy development. In addition, participants specifically identified the need for digital tools that would enable practitioners to enhance understanding of TIC principles and strengthen the community of practice through an online network. 

 Under the leadership of Northumbria’s Garry Elvin, the team created several digital tools to help the TEWV Trust embed TIC within the organisation and assess wellbeing interventions, including a novel Consensus Tool. Development of this tool drew on Dr Yilun Shang’s work on resilient consensus in complex networks \[ **R4**\]. Shang’s research proposed an opinion\-formation model featuring both a private opinion \(not known by others but evolving under local influence\) and an expressed opinion \(varied under peer pressure to conform to the local environment\) for a given topic over a dynamical network \[ **R4**\]. The Consensus Tool is an online system that used Shang’s theoretical framework to allow participants to regularly access statements \(on topics related to TIC and organisational priorities\) and express their opinion on the topic. After giving their views for the first time, on subsequent occasions participants may see their original opinion and also the opinions of other participants with whom they were connected through the network. While taking into account the opinion of others, participants were asked to review their opinion and submit another opinion based on the same statement. This allowed participants to iteratively develop their opinion on certain issues, while reflecting on their own and others’ views on the topic. 

 Another innovative digital tool developed by Northumbria, the Wellbeing Diary, was designed as an evaluation tool to help the Recovery College \(part of the TEWV Trust\) to assess the success of their Music for Wellbeing intervention \[ **R5**\]. This used an integrative model of individual wellbeing, which treats wellbeing as comprising of three streams of information, each corresponding to a particular dimension of wellbeing \(physical, mental, social\). The Wellbeing Diary focused the participants’ awareness of their immediate experience of these dimensions of wellbeing, as well as their sense of pleasure/displeasure prior to and after listening to music from a choice of playlists provided, including ones intended to be relaxing or enlivening. Analysis showed statistically significant positive changes in emotional wellbeing, valence, and sense of meaning \(all p<0.001\), with a medium effect size. Findings also indicated a statistically significant change for physical wellbeing \(p=0.009\), with a small effect size \[ **R5**\]. Analysis of participants’ wellbeing diaries showed that the relaxing playlists led to lower arousal, and enlivening playlists led to an increase in activation, helping the TEWV Trust to assess the success of the intervention built on TIC’s principles of self\-reflection and empowerment.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys \(TEWV\) NHS Foundation Trust applied Northumbria’s research findings to embed Trauma Informed Care \(TIC\) within the organisation and helped to shape the first national policy for TIC in the UK. Collaborative work between TEWV and Northumbria University also helped to establish a network to both support practitioners and enable them to use consensus\-building tools to develop improved services. An innovative assessment tool was deployed in a national wellbeing initiative. 

###  4.1 Development of a national framework and influence on NHS Long Term Plan 

 In 2017, the TEWV NHS Foundation Trust set an objective to embed a TIC approach within clinical services. Although this approach is widely used in the USA and practiced by individual clinicians and community organisations in the UK, no national guidelines outlining the main principles of TIC existed at the time. Implementing TIC approaches \(in the absence of national guidelines\) within such a large organisation, which employs more than 6,500 staff and has an annual operating income of over GBP300,000,000, presented a complex series of challenges. 

 The March 2019 national summit \(organised on behalf of the Northern England Clinical Networks and the North East and North Cumbria Academic Health Science Network\) and the follow\-up workshop in July 2019 enabled the main principles of system capability in TIC to be developed \[ **E1**, p5\]. The summit distilled a number of main standards: the way TIC is delivered \(in terms of safety, human experience, language, empowerment\); the way services are organised \(through healing interventions, responsive system design\); and the kinds of relationships that make a TIC service effective \(compassionate and transformational leadership, relational reparation\). Creation of these standards resulted in the publication of the Commissioning Framework on TIC, ‘Developing real world system capability in trauma informed care: learning from good practice’ \(2020\) \[ **E1**, p5, p10, p21 acknowledge Northumbria\]. Angela Kennedy, TIC Lead at the TEWV Trust, stated: 

 *‘Dr Sice was instrumental in co\-developing with me the methodology for a national TIC summit \[that\] enabled the TEWV Trust and the Northern England Clinical Network to develop a novel understanding of the main principles of TIC in the context of the UK, based on the experiences of the TIC summit participants. The summit distilled a number of main standards…These standards formed the core of the comprehensive Commissioning Framework report…Since its inception the Commissioning Framework has become a key document used by practitioners across the UK when embedding TIC in their work’* \[ **E2**, p2\]. 

 Northumbria’s work, and the success of the TIC summit, led to the inclusion of TIC in the national NHS Long Term Plan \(2019\) \[ **E1**, p3\]. The NHS Long Term Plan now states that: *‘New and integrated models of primary and community mental health care will support adults and older adults with severe mental illnesses. A new community\-based offer will include…trauma\-informed care’  \[ **E3**, p69, para3.94\]. For the most vulnerable children and young people, *‘The development of a high\-harm, high risk, high vulnerability trauma\-informed service will provide consultation, advice, assessment, treatment and transition into integrated services’* \[ **E3**, p118, para12\] *.* 

###  4.2 Facilitating implementation of TIC 

 The pioneering work of the TEWV Trust on TIC attracted GBP120,000 investment from NHS England for the development of a national learning community to promote TIC – the FutureNHS Collaboration Platform, as part of the Long Term Plan objectives \[ **E2**, p2\]. Northumbria’s work for the summit and on consensus\-building in complex systems was incorporated into the platform. Northumbria’s researchers created four digital tools; two of these are still in development, and two have been deployed \(the Consensus Tool and Wellbeing Diary, described above\). The Consensus Tool \[ **E4**\] is used by a digital community of practice in the national learning community and also within organisations. It is used to explore challenging questions and investigate how to reach consensus in cases where divergent opinions exist. Angela Kennedy, TIC Lead at the TEWV Trust, stated: 

 *‘\[We\] used the tool during webinars, to monitor how staff opinion on certain matters changed. For example, we recently organised a national webinar on inequality and discrimination on the FutureNHS website…The tool was used before and after the webinar by over 100 NHS staff, allowing us to understand where the community’s values and beliefs lie, and hence understand the directions in which we need to work’* \[ **E2**\] *.* 

 The tool has allowed the TEWV Trust to actively manage how they implement TIC, as well as facilitate dialogue within the professional community. 

 As well as the creation of a national framework and development of the digital practitioner network, the summit also benefitted participants pioneering TIC in their work in the UK. 85 participants attended the workshop, and they included clinicians, chief executives, policy makers, commissioners, representatives of the NHS, social care practitioners, people with lived experience of trauma, and stakeholders working in charity organisations \[ **E2**, p2\]. Feedback collected from almost two\-thirds of the participants \(n=56\) showed that 96% of participants were ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to do something as a result of the workshop, indicating increased motivation to embed TIC in their practice \[ **E5**, p1\]. Open field responses ranged from *‘thinking about making cultural change sustainable’* to *‘I will look to use this technology in the co\-production of pathways/services in the future’* and *‘I would definitely like to try using the approach, i.e., mini narratives/case studies in other work\-related workshops’* \[ **E5**, p4\]. More than 90% of participants were ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to keep in touch with fellow workshop participants, indicating a strengthening of the community of practice \[ **E5**, p2\]. Other participants appreciated the opportunity to improve their knowledge of TIC and co\-produce TIC principles alongside a diverse community of practice \[ **E5**\]. 

###  4.3 Change in strategic direction to support NHS staff 

 Northumbria’s Wellbeing Diary digital tool helped the TEWV Trust to evaluate the success of wellbeing interventions \[ **E6**\] and make decisions about how to deploy them. The Wellbeing Diary is embedded within the Music for Wellbeing intervention and is based on the principles of self\-reflection and empowerment that are critical within TIC. It invited participants to reflect on their perceived state of stress, physical state, arousal, and mood before and after the intervention. By using an online tracker, participants were able to self\-manage their wellbeing. Before the COVID\-19 pandemic, the tool was used by the Recovery College \(part of the TEWV Trust\) with service users; after the outbreak of the pandemic, it was opened up to the wider public, in order to help people manage their wellbeing during prolonged periods of lockdown and self\-isolation. The Wellbeing Diary helped to evaluate the Music for Wellbeing intervention, showing statistically significant positive changes in emotional wellbeing resulting from the intervention \[ **E7**\]. These results enabled the TEWV Trust to make strategic organisational decisions. Angela Kennedy, TIC Lead at the Trust, said: 

 *‘\[O\]ver 300 people used the optional Wellbeing Diary developed by Northumbria. Our online tool helped us to understand the effectiveness of the intervention…The Wellbeing Diary showed that appropriately curated playlists may be able to lead the listener to positive relaxation or activation states, or to positive mood change that may have health benefits. Seeing such positive outcomes, we decided to re\-purpose the wellbeing tracker to create an online tool specifically for NHS staff, helping to boost personal wellbeing during the stressful times of the pandemic’* \[ **E2**\]. 

 The Music for Wellbeing intervention, and the Wellbeing Diary embedded in it, were included in \(and endorsed by\) the Culture, Health and Wellbeing Alliance’s report discussing 50 case studies focused on ‘How creativity and culture are supporting shielding and vulnerable people at home during COVID\-19’ \[ **E8**, p18\-19, p22\-25\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease, affecting all ages. Asthma causes considerable morbidity and significant avoidable mortality. In the UK, 60,000 asthmatics are admitted to hospital annually, with over 1,000 dying. Globally, \~20% of children and \~5% of adults are affected, with 5% of cases having severe disease. Collaboration between the University of Leicester \(UoL\) and GlaxoSmithKline \(GSK\) resulted in the development, licensing, and widespread use of a first\-in\-kind monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab \(Nucala™\), which prevents severe exacerbations. Since its release in 2015, Nucala™ has been prescribed \~150,000 times globally, generating revenue of over GBP1,700,000,000, and transforming the lives of those asthmatics at risk of serious harm. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Asthma is a chronic condition of the airways, which causes considerable morbidity and significant avoidable mortality globally. In the UK, 5,400,000 people receive treatment for asthma with 6,400,000 GP and nurse consultations annually. 60,000 asthmatics are hospitalised each year with >1,000 dying. Globally, the latter figure rises to >250,000 **\[E13\]**. Asthma costs the NHS >GBP1,000,000,000 per year. **\[E12\]**. 

 Generally, asthma is characterised by two patterns of disease presentation: episodic breathlessness primarily due to airway smooth muscle \(ASM\) contraction and exacerbations primarily due to airway inflammation. Standard treatment for ASM utilises beta2 agonists while inhaled corticosteroids are effective in preventing exacerbations, though oral administration is required in severe eosinophilic exacerbations. These exacerbations cause asthma deaths. The frequent need for continuous corticosteroid treatment is a risk factor for several conditions including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and bone thinning. Asthmatics with inadequately controlled disease—estimated to be \~250,000 in the UK—suffer significant impairments in their quality of life, mental health, and employment. 

 Prior to UoL research, there was a major unmet need for new therapies to help this group. Though the importance of eosinophils in asthma was known for several decades, by 2000 the widely accepted paradigm was that asthma resulted from eosinophilic inflammation, caused by allergen\-activated T\-cells synthesising the specific eosinophil growth factor interleukin 5 \(IL\-5\). 

 The anti\-IL\-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab was developed by GSK to improve symptoms and lung function \(FEV<sub>1</sub>\) by preventing IL\-5 binding to the IL\-5 receptor, thus neutralising it. However, allergen challenge models of asthma and clinical trials concluded that mepolizumab had no effect on either airway hyperresponsiveness \(AHR\) or FEV<sub>1</sub>, despite marked reductions in blood eosinophils. These results had convinced GSK to halt mepolizumab development until intervention by the Leicester Institute for Lung Health \(LILH\), spearheaded by Wardlaw, Pavord, Brightling, and Bradding. 

 Based on their clinical and laboratory observations using innovative methods for investigating patient’s sputum samples, LILH proposed a new model of asthma, deconstructing it to its component pathophysiological abnormalities **\[R1\].** Examining airway tissue from their patients they found that eosinophils were only responsible for the exacerbation component of asthma, and not the ASM abnormalities which were responsible for day\-to\-day symptoms **\[R2\].** LILH further demonstrated that active eosinophilic inflammation was not present in all asthmatics **\[R3\]** and proposed that only those with an increased sputum eosinophil count would respond to anti\-eosinophil therapies **\[R4\]**. LILH proved this paradigm shift in a landmark paper that showed that if airway eosinophilia was effectively blocked by corticosteroids then exacerbations were almost completely prevented without major effects on day\-to\-day symptoms or lung function. The paper also demonstrated that only patients with active eosinophilic inflammation responded to corticosteroids **\[R5\].** 

  

 This ground\-breaking research convinced GSK to commission and support LILH to undertake an investigator\-designed and led, Phase\-2, single\-centre, double\-blind, placebo\-controlled clinical trial, of twelve months treatment with mepolizumab in patients with active eosinophilic airway inflammation \(measured in sputum\), using severe exacerbations as the primary outcome measure. This study demonstrated that mepolizumab prevented \~50% of exacerbations, without any discernible effect on day\-to\-day symptoms, AHR or FEV<sub>1</sub> **\[R6\]**, showing that eosinophils were causal in exacerbations and suggesting that mepolizumab would be effective in severe asthma if targeted at those with eosinophilic, exacerbation\-prone disease. GSK followed this trial with a multi\-dose, multi\-centre Phase\-2 trial \(DREAM\) in collaboration with LILH, using the same design. This confirmed the original findings, additionally discovering that blood and sputum eosinophil counts were equally as effective in identifying treatment\-responsive eosinophilic asthmatics **\[R7\].** Subsequent Phase\-3 studies \(MENSA and SIRIUS\) further verified LILH results. 

  

 This research collaboration with LILH led to GSK obtaining a global license in 2015 for the use of mepolizumab in adults and children, marketed as Nucala™. GSK continues to adapt Nucala for the treatment of rare conditions related to severe asthma including eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis \(EGPA; formerly Churg\-Strauss\) and hypereosinophilic syndrome with **Wardlaw** a co\-author **.** 

 The study designs established by LILH for mepolizumab, stemming from their concepts of asthma based on their laboratory and clinical studies, have been used successfully to develop several other anti\-T2 biologicals including reslizumab \(also anti\-IL\-5\), benralizumab \(anti\-IL\-5 receptor\), and dupilumab \(anti\-IL\-4/13\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Through highly original reverse translational research and innovative laboratory methodologies, LILH were integral to the development of mepolizumab – a new class of highly effective treatment therapies for severe asthma. First licensed in 2015, the drug is prescribed worldwide, providing substantial economic benefits and significant patient outcome improvements. 

  

 Using novel targeting of distinct pathophysiological traits identified through innovative laboratory approaches by the team, with a classical precision medicine approach, LILH have trail\-blazed therapy development for asthma and related diseases, achieving global impact in three main areas. 

 <ins> **Economic Impact**</ins> 

 Prior to LILH intervention, GSK intended to cease mepolizumab development. Leicester research prevented this and opened new markets enabling global release of mepolizumab \(Nucala™\), now a key pillar of GSK’s continued success. Nucala™ was first licensed in 2015 **\[E1\]** and has grown exponentially, with sales revenue rising from GBP1,000,000  in 2015 to GBP768,000,000 in 2019. To date, Nucala™ has generated GSK revenue of \~GBP1,800,000,000 **\[E2\]**. 

 Significantly, Nucala™ is the fastest growing respiratory product within the GSK portfolio and, despite its relatively recent market introduction, has compensated for the general decline of sales within the GSK pharmaceuticals area. The 2019 Annual Report states that *“respiratory sales were up 18% AER, 15% CER to \[GBP\]3,081 million, on growth of Trelegy, Elipta and Nucala”.* Of the drugs listed as continuing successes, Nucala™ is the highest selling drug class **\[E2\]**. 

 Beyond GSK, mepolizumab’s benefits are widespread within the healthcare sector. Of the GBP1,100,000,000 annual NHS cost of asthma treatment, GBP137,000,000 results from patient hospitalisation **\[E11\]**. Studies into mepolizumab’s efficacy demonstrate that its use provides a 73% reduction in hospitalisation, thereby saving the NHS an estimated \~GBP19,000,000 annually **\[E8\].** 

 <ins> **Changing Clinical Practice**</ins> 

 In 2016, a joint committee of the British Thoracic Society and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network, on which Brightling provided expert advice, produced their ‘British Guideline on the Management of Asthma’. This guideline, for the first time, recommended the use of mepolizumab as a treatment option for severe asthma based on LILH research. The guideline also extensively utilised LILH research to inform and underpin best\-practice recommendations for eosinophilic disease detection. These recommendations were adopted and included in guidelines issued the same year by the British Society for Haematology, European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology **\[E4\]**. 

 National clinical standards in the UK are defined by NICE whose recommendations are implemented as standard procedure within all NHS hospitals and represent the gold standard globally. Following the BTS\-SIGN guideline, NICE began consultation on the use of mepolizumab as a treatment for severe asthma, resulting in the 2017 guideline ‘Mepolizumab for treating severe refractory eosinophilic asthma’. This codified the drug as a treatment option in the NHS for the first time, noting that prior to its creation *“there was a need for alternative treatments for people with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma”* **\[E3\]**. 

 Since 2016, as a result of ground\-breaking LILH research, mepolizumab is recommended for use in treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma in clinical practice guidelines worldwide including Japan, the EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia **\[E4\]**. 

 The Global Initiative for Asthma \(GINA\) is the leading international medical guidelines organisation covering asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Each year, GINA publish evidence\-based guidelines titled ‘Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention’, used by clinicians worldwide. In each iteration since 2017, mepolizumab is a recommended treatment option. This demonstrates the paradigm shift driven and enabled by LILH **\[E5\]**. 

 <ins> **Improving Patient Health Outcomes**</ins> 

 Following NICE approval, a statement was released by the Director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, Professor Carole Longson, in which the novelty and efficacy of Mepolizumab was foregrounded. Longson stated that the 100,000 adults in England and Wales with severe, uncontrolled asthma previously *“had limited treatment options”* with many using inhaled corticosteroids for prolonged periods causing further complications such as diabetes and high blood pressure; “as *the first biologic treatment to target immune cells called eosinophils. These cells are responsible for symptoms in thousands of asthma patients”.* Mepolizumab would enable significant treatment and quality of life improvements for sufferers **\[E6\]**. 

 By 2019, there were an estimated 17,507 UK patients eligible for mepolizumab, with 3,258 receiving the treatment **\[E11\]**. Global adoption of mepolizumab immediately provided significant patient health improvements. The French mepolizumab early\-access programme demonstrated 86% reduction in severe exacerbations with 65% of patients stopping continuous corticosteroid treatment **\[E7\]**, while the Australian Mepolizumab Registry showed 60% reduction in severe exacerbations. Follow\-up studies demonstrated a 73% reduction in hospitalisations in patients receiving the drug between 2015 and 2017 **\[E8\]**. 

 The real\-world benefits of mepolizumab were confirmed by the US Institute for Clinical and Economic Review which concluded that use of the drug was associated with a 53% reduction in asthma exacerbations with similar reductions demonstrated in the annual per\-patient rates of emergency department visits \(61% reduction\) and hospitalisations generally \(69% reduction\) **\[E9\]**. To date, an estimated 150,000 people worldwide have been treated with mepolizumab since 2015 **\[E10\]**. 

 Without the expert intervention of LILH, mepolizumab would have been abandoned, falsely regarded as ineffective based on an incorrect understanding of asthma pathophysiology. Instead, thousands of patients globally now benefit from new treatment options and drastically improved life quality. Drug discovery methods have been revolutionised and avenues for novel, effective treatments have been opened, ensuring continued progress in the global battle against asthma.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Toulmin’s research on circus history had positive cultural, artistic, economic, and heritage impact. Her co\-curation of ‘Show of Shows’ enriched museums’ and archives’ knowledge of their collections, enhancing the preservation and interpretation of cultural heritage, improving visitor experience and numbers, and raising museums’ profile and reputation. She brought circus to new audiences and venues \(museums, a cathedral\), co\-producing and/or having input into new cultural artefacts \(live performances, documentaries, a play\). In particular, she recovered circus’ diverse ethnic and gender history, increasing not only public understanding and appreciation of circus, but also that of circus practitioners, empowering BAME and female performers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Toulmin’s research recovers the history and cultural value of the circus, showground, and music hall: traditionally working\-class forms of recreation and artistry which are generally marginalised by academic study, which tends to focus on more elite forms. As the founding Director of the National Fairground Archive at The University of Sheffield \(1995\-2016\), she took an active role in the collection, preservation, management, interpretation, and dissemination of an archive which gives unique insight into the culture and history of travelling shows and entertainments \(R1\). 

 Toulmin has published extensively on the history of fairs and freak shows; neo\-variety, burlesque, and outdoor spectacular theatre; and early film. Work on the latter highlighted the commercial significance of appealing to local audiences \(R2\). Toulmin’s most recent work has been focused on investigating the global history of circus, its evolving genre since its formation in 1768, when the Englishman Philip Astley opened the first modern circus in London, and the architectural spaces that housed it: far from being staged solely in ‘big tents’, nineteenth\-century circus often performed in wooden amphitheatres or even in bespoke buildings, such as that designed by Frank Matcham in Blackpool \(R3\). 

 As well as recuperating a critically neglected area of popular culture and social and performance history, Toulmin’s work with primary archival material has also recovered the hitherto overlooked significance of women and of BAME circus performers and entrepreneurs to circus history, as the creators of innovative acts \(including Astley’s equestrienne wife, Patty, and Lena Jordan, inventor of the triple somersault, R4\), and as circus proprietors \(e.g. the equestrian Pablo Fanque, R4\). As such, the research makes a significant contribution to the recovery and understanding of the ‘hidden’ histories of women and ethnic minorities, and the important – but often overlooked – roles they played. 

 Toulmin’s research also uncovers the ways in which circus was from its inception an international project: Astley toured extensively beyond the UK, and included artists from across Europe in his shows, and circus habitually incorporated the performance styles of the cultures to which it travelled. In the process, Toulmin’s research situates circus as a portable and adaptable art form, as well as a mode of entertainment, and traces how it influenced other creative media \(including cinema, dance, and fashion\). 

 Toulmin’s research is hands\-on and collaborative. In addition to ‘traditional’ academic outputs \(R2\-4\), her work has involved co\-curating exhibitions \(R5\) and producing accessible, public\-facing publications, based on primary archival work \(R6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 As historical adviser to Circus250, Toulmin was ‘crucial’ to shaping how circus was celebrated in its 250<sup>th</sup>anniversary year, highlighting circus as an international artform with a diverse ethnic and gender history; this enabled female and BAME performers to see themselves as part of circus history, ‘empowering the future by knowing the past’ \[S1\]. 

 Diversity was at the core of ‘Show of Shows’ \(2018\): **three parallel exhibitions** co\-curated by Toulmin at Time&Tide \(Great Yarmouth\), Discovery Museum \(Newcastle\), and Museums Sheffield \[S2\]. Toulmin instigated the idea, collaborated with curators on a successful Heritage Lottery Fund application \(£98K\), and helped shape the exhibitions. Her recognition of the pull of the local \(gained from research on early film\) and knowledge of circus history enabled each museum to use local figures as focal points and tell ‘hidden’ histories of BAME and female performers. Without Toulmin, the exhibition ‘would have been a non\-starter’ \(Hamilton, Museums Sheffield\); ‘it would not have been of the \[same\] quality’ \(Wilson, Discovery Museum \[S2, S3\]. 

 Toulmin’s impact on the exhibitions is exemplified by her discovery in Sheffield City Archives of the only known images of the black circus proprietor/equestrian Fanque \(displayed for the first time in the Sheffield exhibition\) and her curation of Degas’ 1879 painting *Miss Lala*, owned by the National Gallery \(NG\). The NG’s interpretation focused on Degas; Toulmin connected it to its subject: Miss Lala, a black aerialist celebrated for strength and skill. This knowledge – new to the NG – was ‘crucial’ in securing its loan to Museums Sheffield, a rare instance of the NG loaning to a non\-art exhibition; Hamilton acknowledges the significance of Miss Lala’s loan to enhancing Museum Sheffield’s reputation and building an on\-going relationship with the NG \[S2\]. Toulmin paired the portrait with footage of the 21<sup>st</sup>\-century black aerialist Blaze Tarsha, ‘allowing young black women to see themselves within cultural institutions where previously they had been invisible’ \[S1\]. This video was posted on Facebook \(900\+ views\). 

 ‘Show of Shows’ attracted 261,944 visitors across the three museums, with Time&Tide experiencing a 21% increase in shop\-sales \[S2\]. Museums Sheffield had a footfall of c.63K, a daily average \(610\) higher than any exhibition within the last 2 years \[S4\]. Footfall directly correlates with donations and commercial income, enabling future activities. The exhibitions and accompanying creative programme also engaged a wide, multi\-generational demographic, including hard\-to\-reach groups \(e.g. Roma, the homeless\). 32% of Sheffield’s visitors had not previously been to the museum. 92% agreed the exhibitions had increased their knowledge of circus history. ‘Show of Shows Live Late’ in Sheffield sold out in record time \(350 tickets\) and was live streamed on Youtube \(the first time Museums Sheffield had done this: a change to institutional practice\). Toulmin’s media profile meant the exhibitions received unprecedented reach in press coverage, including the USA \[S2\]. Many press articles showcased the archival material and research provided by Toulmin \(e.g. *Guardian*, readership 17 million\). 

 Toulmin’s research improved **museums and archives’ understanding of their collections**. Since circuses travelled, many collections contain relevant material which has remained overlooked and undervalued. ‘Show of Shows’ led to the conservation of 200\+ objects \[S4\]. Toulmin also identified the worldwide significance of Sheffield City Archives’ uncatalogued playbill collection and highlighted Sheffield’s historical significance as a circus venue. This ensured the collection’s cataloguing and conservation, and put the archive ‘in a much better position to raise awareness of Sheffield’s history, one of our key aims’ \[S5\]. At the Ringling Museum, Florida, Toulmin provided ‘critically important’ input, highlighting the diversity and dynamic nature of circus, as the museum was shifting the focus of its programming from circus business and logistics to more global perspectives on its artistry \[S6\]. 

 In addition, Toulmin furthered **public understanding** of circus’ diverse history through c.20 talks to capacity audiences in 2018. She appeared on high\-profile media platforms, including *Women’s Hour* \(3.7million listeners weekly\), and contributed to Birkett’s film *Women in Circus* \(4.2K Facebook views; c.3K via Vimeo\) \[S3\]. Her research also shaped **new cultural artefacts**. She co\-produced two 2018 shows: ‘Sisterhood of the Ring’ was performed to a capacity audience in an ethnically diverse, economically deprived area of Sheffield. Blending performance and historical narrative, it examined the role of race and gender in circus. ‘Mirrors and Ribbons’ explored the female form within circus. Held in Sheffield Cathedral, it demonstrated the portability of circus. Feedback testifies to the positive impact on audience well\-being \(‘I will think of myself as someone beautiful and inspire young girls to feel happy about their body’\) \[S7\]. Flintham’s play *Astley’s Astounding Adventures* \(New Vic, Newcastle\-under\-Lyme, 2018; 8K\+ audience over 3\-week run\) drew heavily on Toulmin’s research about circus entrepreneur Philip Astley \[S8\]. Toulmin also had vital creative input into *Golden Age of Circus* \(dir. Erlingsson\). She co\-produced the film, collaborated on choice of footage, and provided historical context. The film premiered at DocFest \(2015\), UK’s leading documentary festival \(third largest globally\), and was screened at international film festivals \(including Film Lab Palestine, San Sebastian, Sarajevo, Toronto, Tribeca\), independent cinemas nationally, and as part of BBC4’s ‘Storyville’ series \(2016, 2018; av. viewing figure 10K\) \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Working in collaboration with Huntsman Polyurethanes, UofG researchers have developed a new reaction model that comprehensively describes phosgene synthesis catalysis over an activated carbon catalyst. This knowledge has allowed continued improvements in plant operational practice to improve the feedstream management in the phosgene synthesis process and refine their catalyst activation and heat recovery strategies across their Rotterdam \(Netherlands\), Caojing \(China\) and Geismar \(USA\) manufacturing facilities. The open\-source publication of research outputs from the UofG/Huntsman collaboration has restricted competing companies from patenting large blocks of process operations with direct connections to Huntsman’s phosgene synthesis operations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UofG research led by Prof. Lennon \(physical chemistry\) and Prof. Winfield \(inorganic chemistry\) has advanced the fundamental understanding of the physico\-chemical processes required for the industrial scale production of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate \(MDI, OCNC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NCO\), a component in the production of polyurethanes. 

 Despite its industrial pertinence, there have been few publications over the last 70 years in the open literature on phosgene synthesis catalysis connected with large\-scale chemical manufacturing operations. This is, in part, due to the difficulty in safely handling of hazardous chlorinated materials such as chlorine \(Cl\), hydrogen chloride and phosgene. For over 18 years, the industrial/academic partnership between UofG research and Huntsman Polyurethanes sought to address these deficiencies, advancing capability directly relevant to this area of commercial endeavour. Phosgene is generally manufactured on\-site as a precursor in the MDI process chain, to minimise hazards associated with the storage and transportation of this highly toxic gas. 

 This underpinning phase of the collaborative venture includes \(i\) investigating issues connected with Cl recovery within an MDI process chain \[3.1\] and \(ii\) an examination of unfavourable consequences of over\-phosgenation of intermediates encountered within the MDI process chain \[3.2\]. 

 For the latter body of work, the industrialists assisted the academic team by sharing ‘best practice’ in phosgene safe\-handling procedures. In 2011 this culminated in the Huntsman’s investment as a founding partner in the School of Chemistry’s Chemical Process Fundamentals Laboratory \(CPFL\), a facility designed to investigate various areas of technical chemistry. In 2012 a phosgene synthesis catalysis facility was commissioned by Huntsman within the CPFL. 

 A series of three publications from the CPFL has led to a new awareness in phosgene synthesis. The first paper describes a series of laboratory procedures for analysing candidate phosgene synthesis catalysts, including protocols adopted for the safe handling of this hazardous reaction system \[3.3\]. The second paper considers such topics as activation energy, reaction profile and mass balance relationships. The work also determines the rate law for phosgene synthesis over the selected substrate \[3.4\]. The third paper examines adsorption and desorption characteristics of reagents and product \[3.5\]. Together this work by UofG has developed \(in collaboration with Huntsman Polyurethanes\) a new reaction model that comprehensively describes how CO and Cl<sub>2</sub> combine over activated carbon to produce phosgene at high selectivity, in an industrial process environment. This model is the backbone of the Impact Case Study. 

 The mechanism proposed shows dissociatively adsorbed dichlorine resides in two sites; one site supports phosgene formation \(via a ballistic collision with CO\), whilst the other does not. Thus, a degree of Cl is retained at the catalyst surface that does not directly engage in phosgene production. This matter is confirmed by mass balance measurements, a parameter rarely encountered in halogen\-themed heterogeneous catalysis. Moreover, building on this heightened awareness of phosgene synthesis, a subsequent paper demonstrated how Br<sub>2</sub>, a common impurity in the Cl<sub>2</sub> feedstream, can significantly modify the surface chemistry of phosgene synthesis over activated carbon in an industrial setting \[5.3\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Huntsman Polyurethanes is a global leader in MDI\-based polyurethanes, serving over 3,000 customers in more than 90 countries, with applications in diverse areas such as construction, automotive components, and insulation. The Company operates world\-scale production facilities in the US, The Netherlands and China, reporting a sales revenue for the last 12 months of USD3.5 billion \[5.1\]. 

 Huntsman’s MDI\-based polyurethanes *“play a critical role in addressing many of the global megatrends affecting the world today. As the most effective thermal insulant in the market, MDI\-based polyurethane is widely used to deliver energy savings solutions in residential and commercial buildings. It is used throughout the cold chain, in refrigerators and cold stores, helping preserve food.*” \[5.2\]. 

 As noted in Section 2, phosgene is generally manufactured on\-site as a precursor in the MDI process chain. Due to commercial confidentially, Huntsman are unable to quantify the precise financial benefits to them of the UofG research concerning individual steps in multi\-stage overall manufacturing processes of MDI\-based polyurethanes \[5.1\]. They can, however, report on how the company is utilising the knowledge gleaned from the phosgene synthesis catalysis project. 

 The UofG Model has enabled the Company to improve plant operational practice and feedstream management in the phosgene synthesis process. The open\-source publication of research outputs was strategically sought to restrict competing companies from patenting large blocks of process operations with direct connections to Huntsman’s phosgene synthesis operations. 

            1.  **Improved management of bromine \(Br\) and chlorine \(Cl\) in the phosgene synthesis process**. 

 Huntsman’s large\-scale MDI manufacturing facilities consume high volumes of Cl at their Rotterdam \(400,000 tonnes per annum; tpa\), Caojing \(240,000 tpa\) and Geismar \(500,000 tpa\) plants.  The UofG Model was applied to evaluate concern related to small quantities of Br<sub>2</sub> in the Cl<sub>2</sub> feedstream. This matter is of importance to the Company because trace contamination of Br can result in unwelcome MDI colouration. Although process patents exist to mitigate against the presence of small quantities of Br<sub>2</sub> in the Cl<sub>2</sub> feedstream of phosgene synthesis units \[5.5\-5.8\], a submitted UofG/Huntsman collaborative publication \[5.3\] is the only open source and transparent scientific paper that addresses the issue of how the Br<sub>2</sub> affects the surface chemistry of the phosgene synthesis process. 

 Through a rigorous experimental programme undertaken in the CPFL, the UofG reaction model has been adapted to explain the action of small quantities of Br<sub>2</sub>. For the first time, this has shown the Company how the reaction system is modified in the presence of Br<sub>2</sub>. The UofG Model highlights a role for BrCl and additionally assesses the relevance of entities such as COBrCl and COBr<sub>2</sub> \[5.3\]. The Company has combined this knowledge with their own pre\-existing thermodynamic model \(that excludes surface interactions\) to rationalise how the Br is partitioning within the large\-scale reaction system. This knowledge has enabled Huntsman to improve their adaptability to the source material and produce higher quality MDI through improved management of Br incorporation. It also enables them to mitigate the impact of chlorine\-quality variations on unwelcome MDI colouration through manipulation of the temperature gradient at the rear of the reactor \[5.8\]. 

            1.  **Application of UofG model to improve plant operational practice** 

 The UofG Model in Section 2 comprehensively describes phosgene production over an activated carbon catalyst to produce phosgene at high selectivity in an industrial process environment. Huntsman have applied the UofG model to their thermodynamic model of phosgene production to deliver on\-going improvements in plant operational practice concerning two linked actions: \(i\) the initial catalyst conditioning process and \(ii\) heat recovery. Phosgene formation is highly exothermic which can lead to increased reaction temperatures in the centre of the catalyst bed. The UofG reaction model has been used to justify why certain Cl pre\-treatments lead to more sustained phosgene production and extended catalyst lifetimes. These advancements at the industrial complex have enhanced the ability to maintain sustained maximum Cl conversion. The awareness provided by the academic researchers has assisted Huntsman chemists and chemical engineers in improving operational efficiency at their large\-scale phosgene synthesis facilities. 

 **3. Strategic investment in the CPFL by Huntsman.** 

 Huntsman has invested £300,000 in this long\-standing academic/industrial partnership to understand the fundamentals of phosgene synthesis and has been fully supportive of publishing research outcomes of in the open literature. This has \(i\) efficiently disseminated new awareness of a hazardous chemical process *“contributing to cultural change in the whole isocyanate manufacturing sector”* \[5.1\] and \(ii\) produced a wide scope of technical material into the public domain. This latter attribute had a business driver; namely, to restrict the Company’s competitors from patenting large blocks of process operations with direct connections to Huntsman’s global phosgene synthesis operations.

 The Global Sound Movement \(GSM\), based at the University of Central Lancashire, is a research project with a wide international reach and significant global cultural impact. Winners of the Times Higher Education Award 2016 for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts \[C1\], GSM is concerned with cultural preservation through audio archiving of musical instruments and performance spaces of significant importance to individual indigenous tribes and communities.  This combined with the development of new music technology designed to disseminate these research findings ensures that new audiences engage with these musical cultures, preserving this unique heritage. The project has financially contributed to education programmes across Uganda, social development and community projects in Indonesia, whilst assisting agricultural initiatives in Southern China. International musicians and sound designers that engage with the GSM sound libraries have developed new techniques and instrument pairings, creating new works only made possible through the GSM.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 GSM is a non\-profit organisation and an research project that aims to identify, record and archivise musical instruments built by indigenous communities in areas of social or economic need. These recordings are digitised and sample libraries and sampler instruments are created and sold to the international music community, with all monies generated being donated to the original instrument makers and communities. Having travelled over 65,000 miles, the Global Sound Movement currently have conducted projects in Uganda, Cyprus, Bali, China, Croatia, Gibraltar and Morocco.

 From 2015, a fundamental aspect of GSM has been the recording of unique musical instruments in their natural surroundings or performance areas. For the most part, the instruments captured by GSM are rare, hand built and unique to a specific tribe, community or geographical location. Each instrument recorded is sampled with every note being captured in high resolution at varying levels of velocity and volume. Through innovative microphone placement techniques and field recording methods, the natural ambience of the performance space is captured and becomes inherent to the recordings.  Following extensive post\-production and pioneering digital instrument creation, sampler instruments are made that fully integrate to digital audio workstations. Research has been conducted into how multiple unique instrument pairings work sonically and produces coherent musical works consisting of previously unheard musical instruments and their combinations \[5\]. 

 <ins> **The GSM Player</ins> <ins>\[2\]**</ins> 

 Enabling non\-musicians to engage with the sounds and instruments captured by the Global Sound Movement is of paramount importance to the educational element of the project. In order to create accessibility, a new innovative musical interface has been developed since 2018 that is hosted online. This has changed the way coders of PHP integrate JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\) to work with timeline\-based systems within web browsers. The development of this has benefitted other coders of these scripts internationally.  Users can compose music with either pre\-selected loops or single hits to create a new unique piece of music. The sounds that can be triggered are taken from each country visited by the GSM, creating new instrument pairings that cross culture, location and genres of music. 

  

 <ins> **Virtual Reality</ins> <ins>\[3\]**</ins> 

 In the summer of 2018 location recordings in Yunnan Province, China uncovered a unique percussion instrument that was wholly integral to the rituals, performances and cultural storytelling of the Hani tribe. Along with a detailed and high\-resolution recording session, The Global Sound Movement took in excess of 350 photographs at varying angles. Through innovative design and coding the ‘Devine Drum’ now exists in Virtual Reality and users not only trigger the actual sound of the instrument in is original setting but receive haptic feedback from the controllers and this provides a realistic experience of playing the drum. This virtual instrument ensures that a wider international audience can engage with the instrument whilst the original remains in its natural home. 

 <ins> **Global Sound Movement Website</ins> <ins>\[4\]**</ins> 

 Since 2015 the main output for the project is the extensive website publication. As international access to the research of the Global Sound Movement is central to the aims of the members of the project, this website has many innovative features and systems that assist with the dissemination of information. Details of how the Global Sound Movement operate in the field and in postproduction educates users about different cultures, musical instruments, locations and soundscapes specific to each location, whilst providing global access to rare instruments. These products can be purchased and included in new compositions or sound design. 

 The website houses the online store where all instruments and products can be purchased. By using the website as the main form of interaction with the project, GSM can gather data and analyse international public engagement. 

 Between 2015 and 2017 there have been seven projects in Uganda, Cyprus, Bali, Zadar, Yunnan Province, Gibraltar, Morocco. Further trips to China also occurred throughout 2018. However, the application development and technology area of the project is ongoing with the continuing innovation and development of new technology.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Global Sound Movement has extensive international reach. Following media attention from industry press an article about the GSM Uganda project was translated into eight different languages and published internationally. Phil Holmes was then interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme \[E2\] and the BBC World Service \[E3\], with a combined listenership of 188 million. Following this, hits to the Global Sound Movement increased massively and currently stands at 65,000 unique visitors. The website has sold over 2,000 downloadable products \[A\] and is often the subject of music specific blog articles \[E4, E5, E6, E7, E9\]. A conference presentation by the GSM in Beijing, China in March 2019 was streamed live and viewed by 3.8 Million viewers via WeChat \[C7\]. BBC One commissioned a short film about the GSM Project hosted by Mark Radcliffe and included the acclaimed guitarist Aziz Ibrahim, associated with the Stone Roses, Paul Weller etc. This was broadcast on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2020 \[E1\]. 

 **“I got such a buzz out of meeting the GSM guys. The work they've put into what is a fascinating and vital resource and archive is truly admirable. Perhaps in these challenging times of climate change and Coronavirus our futures will involve considerably less travel and so it makes it even more important that these sounds have been preserved before it's too late. Thanks to their work we will have access to these sounds for the rest of time”.** – Mark Radcliffe, BBC Radio2 \[E11\]

 Set up as a Non\-Profit Organisation, the Global Sound Movement commercialise their research outputs for community benefit by way of selling the digital products via an online store. Each product sold is catalogued and all funds are assigned to the original project. Quarterly, these funds are distributed back to the communities that built the original instrument/s or the NGO partners in the locale. Since 2016, GSM have been donating funds back to Uganda, Africa, where the people of Nakimembe \(village North West of Jinja\) have received monies that have enabled upwards of 150 children of the village to receive school meals and uniforms \[D3\]. This has in turn seen the level of education raised within the village and means that the food supplies can be directed to other members of the community, increasing nutrition and health. The NGO ‘Brass For Africa’ \[D1\] receives regular donations and supplies of brass instruments that are used for Musical Education purposes across orphanages in Kampala. ‘Hands for Hope’ \[D2\] is an NGO that provides schooling from early years to high school for children and learners housed in the Namuwongo Slum, Kampala. Donations from the GSM to ‘Hands for Hope’ provide musical education and enrichment activities alongside language, mathematics and science classes. 

  

 Projects across Yunnan province, Southern China have seen donations to three tribes that reside in mountainous regions close to the Vietnamese boarder \[D4\]. Yao, Yi and Hani communities have all benefited from the monies that have been received and the GSM are aware that the finance is being channelled in to developing agricultural land and the way in which it can be farmed more efficiently. Extra produce is sold generating another income stream for the community \[D4\]. Supporting sustainability and building relationships with communities in this way was acknowledged by Synchtank when GSM was listed in the top 25 international music charities \[E8\]. 

  

 <ins> **Enabling musicians, composers and sound designers to innovate and develop**</ins> 

 Traditional and wholly unique musical instruments are recorded and developed into sample libraries that integrate with professional Digital Audio Workstations \(DAWs\) such as ProTools, Logic Pro X, Ableton and Native Instruments Kontakt. This integration enables musicians to include the sounds recorded by GSM into new musical works. This is especially important and impactful when concerned with musical diaspora. Allowing musicians to utilise the sounds of instruments they would not otherwise have access to into their compositions. As well as providing an avenue for the individuals to use their native instruments digitally. Specific instruments traditional to certain countries are now available to download and use. Mediterranean musician, Edoardo Talenti, composer for BBC’s *Death in Paradise* and film scores for Magnus Fiennes includes GSM samples and instruments in new works. He fuses Greek and Turkish instruments with Hip\-Hop production methods creating a new sound to the genre. The ‘Artist Series’ section \[B\] of the Global Sound Movement website displays testimony from multiple and varied international music producers who explain how the GSM samples and sound have changed their compositional techniques creating new works, instrument pairings and developments of genre. Of particular note has been the acclaimed guitarist and composer, Aziz Ibrahim who is currently working with the Samples recorded in China and combining them with innovative guitar layering techniques \[E1\]. This is developed on mobile platforms and the GSM samples fully integrate into this technology making it more accessible to musicians without studios or DAWs. The engagement by contemporary artists with these sounds connects them musically with the indigenous cultures, sounds and instruments, which ultimately provides international exposure to this heritage.

 Innovative developments and app creation enables the GSM to disseminate research findings to a wide audience across age groups, international locations and languages. This is made possible by the GSM Player, a step sequencer that plays across platforms in any browser, therefore making the GSM sounds accessible to anyone with an internet connection globally. Users engage with the material and are empowered to create and compose music and soundscapes through products designed by the GSM. Each product has detailed information embedded that explains every sound and instrument. Through workshops delivered across primary schools in North West England, students have a hands\-on experience composing music regardless of theoretical knowledge \[E10\]. Innovative integration of this player enhances other subjects at different Key Stages of the National Curriculum. Geography, Maths, English, History and World Topics are subjects enhanced by this technology, not just Music classes. 

  

 Following the success at the Times Higher Education Awards where the GSM project won the ‘Excellence and Innovation in the Arts’ category 2016 \[C1\], members of the project were invited to speak at education and creative conferences in Africa and China \[C2, C3, C4\]. BBC news covered a press conference at the 2019 British Science festival where GSM presented ‘Preserving rare instruments in the virtual world’ through the innovative VR software \[C6, C7\]. 

 Partnerships between the Global Sound Movement and Chinese Universities have proven positive where collaborative projects have taken place, Hebei University in Boading, China worked with the GSM to present a fashion show. Here the music composed used samples taken from southern China, informed garment design and resulted in a catwalk show in Beijing in March 2018 where GSM performed live. Following the success of this project, Paresh Parmar and Phil Holmes were invited as keynote speakers at the Chinese Service Centre for Scholarly Exchange \(CSCSE\) conference in Beijing March 2019. This was streamed to 3.8 million viewers \[C5\] and was the only keynote from UK Universities. This has led to further discussions with the Chinese Ministry of Education \(People\-to\-People\) with regards to multiple projects and knowledge transfer initiatives that will assist with cultural preservation along the route of the ‘Belt and Road initiative’ set out by the Chinese government. 

  

 The Global Sound Movement continues to donate finance to areas of economic need, provide innovative musical instruments to composers globally and educate international communities about musical cultures.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Money Charity statistics show that by the end of October 2020, people in the UK owed a total of GBP1,689bn – equating to GBP31,867 per adult – in personal debt. Through two projects on the culture of finance – **Picturing Finance** and **The History of Financial Advice** – Paul Crosthwaite’s research has raised public awareness of the ways in which money, investment, credit and debt operate and affect us. Working as part of an AHRC\-funded project, and with five UK venues, his co\-curated exhibition *Show Me the Money: The Image of Finance, 1700 to the Present* reached approximately 70,000 people, producing acclaimed new work by commissioned artists, and receiving excellent reviews from the public and media alike \(“ *It ought to be possible to force people to visit this exhibition*”\). Free digital resources from both projects, including an app, MOOC \(over 8,000 enrolments\) and eight quality\-accredited lesson plans, have improved financial literacy, a relatively new addition to the National Curriculum and one that has rapidly increased in importance as Britain prepares to meet the twin economic challenges posed by Brexit and the global COVID\-19 pandemic. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 “Financial crises are the signal events of our time” noted Paul Crosthwaite in his 2010 article “Blood on the Trading Floor: Waste, Sacrifice and Death in Financial Crises”, which was published in the wake of the global recession. In the decade since, while a Lecturer \(now Senior Lecturer\) in English Literature at the University of Edinburgh, Crosthwaite has written extensively on the links between literature and finance, bringing humanities approaches to bear on economic questions in order to better understand the abstract – and often mystifying – domain of money, investment, credit and debt. Working alongside Professors Peter Knight \(University of Manchester\) and Nicky Marsh \(University of Southampton\), he has developed understanding of the term Economic Humanities, using literary and cultural methodologies to “remedy the technocratic ‘tunnel vision’ besetting both financial professionals and academic economists” \(3.1\). In his 2019 monograph \(3.2\), for example, Crosthwaite shows how mainstream economists’ assumption that asset prices are “efficient” \(i.e. accurately reflect all available information\) contributed to the global financial crisis of 2007\-8. He argues that this disaster might have been averted had it been recognised that the “efficient market hypothesis” is not so much a statement of fact as a singularly powerful narrative. He shows how a methodology grounded in literary studies can make visible the beliefs, desires and fantasies that underlie this narrative and shape its adherents’ actions. 

 While there is a tradition of research into the relationship between finance and literature, few before have attempted to grasp the integral importance of visual culture both to the operations of finance and to a critical questioning of some of its assumptions and practices. This is why, while based in literary studies, Crosthwaite’s research explores the intersections between multiple forms of artistic expression and the theory and practice of financial markets. Originally brought together with Knight and Marsh through an Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) networking grant for the Culture of the Market Network \(2009\-2011\), he has been a Co\-Investigator on two subsequent AHRC projects: **Picturing Finance** \(AH/K001787/1; GBP87,248; 2013\-2014\), the principal output from which was the touring exhibition *Show Me the Money: The Image of Finance, 1700 to the Present*; and **The History of Financial Advice** \(AH/N003241/1; GBP362,320; 2016\-2019\). Collectively, the team also co\-curated a journal article in *Public Culture*, “Imagining the Market: A Visual History” \(3.3\). 

 *Show Me the Money* charted the changing ways in which artists, photographers and illustrators have depicted money over the last three centuries in Britain and the United States of America \(USA\). In the exhibition, its accompanying book \(3.4\) and an article in *New Formations* \(3.5\), Crosthwaite, Knight and Marsh revealed the crucial role imagery has played in shaping beliefs about “the markets”, and analysed the ways in which visual culture reflects broader societal attitudes towards money. Drawing on his research into how the “placeless” market can be conveyed in visuals and text, Crosthwaite conceived of and curated one of the exhibition’s five core themes, “Framing Finance”. In his book chapter of the same name, he writes that “an element of abstraction has always been integral to the image of finance – just as abstraction is a constitutive feature of finance itself” \(3.4\). 

  

 Crosthwaite has an interest in the ways that financial activity is influenced by figurative language \(such as metaphors of animality \[3.6\]\) and by superstitions or irrational beliefs: the “occult” elements of finance, as he writes in *The Market Logics of Contemporary Fiction* \(3.2\). Reflected in *Show Me the Money*, this interest also informs The History of Financial Advice, his latest collaboration with Knight and Marsh, together with Co\-Investigators Dr Helen Paul \(University of Southampton\) and Dr James Taylor \(Lancaster University\). Again focusing on Britain and the USA, the project represents the first thorough study of financial self\-help literature which, despite amassing a huge readership since it first emerged in the eighteenth century, remains largely neglected by cultural, economic and literary historians and critics. Economists have been puzzled by the perennial popularity of guides to beating the stock market, given the limited evidence for their efficacy. As explained in Crosthwaite and his collaborators’ recent articulation of a research programme for the Economic Humanities \(3.1\), a literary and cultural approach can solve this puzzle by analysing such texts as narrative and rhetorical artefacts that appeal to fantasies of success, mastery and self\-fashioning. The project also highlights the extent to which the genre of financial advice writing has failed to reflect the historical prevalence of female stockholders, while at the same time exhibiting acute anxieties over the relationship between gender and investment.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Writing in **Show Me the Money* \(3.4\), Paul Crosthwaite reflects on artists’ long\-standing desire to “retain traces of the particular, the local, the tangible and the material” in their representation of the markets. Together with Knight and Marsh, he developed the eponymous touring exhibition along similar lines, taking research into five regional venues with a strong stake in local communities. Beginning in Sunderland’s Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art, near the site of the 2007 collapse of Northern Rock bank, the exhibition toured to the John Hansard Gallery in Southampton, Chawton House Library in Hampshire and two venues in Manchester: Alliance Manchester Business School and the People’s History Museum, the UK’s national museum of democracy. Overall, the exhibition attracted approximately 50,000 visitors and was accompanied by a programme of public events and educational workshops that involved approximately 1,200 participants \(5.2a; 5.2c; 5.2d\). The show was featured in *The Times* \(print circulation 393,530\), *The Guardian* \(185,313\) and *The Independent* \(63,505\), reviewed in the *Financial Times* \(213,359\) as “ *striking \[in its\] breadth and its inventiveness*” \(5.1a\), and commended in the *Morning Star* \(approximately 10,000\) for “ *graphically expos\[ing\] the world of high finance*” \(5.1b\). 

 *Show Me the Money*’s themed display of 100 items featured both historic and contemporary artefacts, including five specially\-commissioned new artworks. The exhibition significantly fostered public understanding of the constitutive roles of imagination, visualisation and representation in financial and economic processes and practices. Evoking a range of emotions in audiences, its personal impact can be summed up by one visitor who said “ *It ought to be possible to force people to visit this exhibition*” \(5.2a, p. 26\). Others commented that it was “ *priceless\!*”, “ *moving, disturbing*”, “ *hauntingly honest*”, and “ *enlightening/depressing*” \(5.2b\). Feedback suggests that the show helped visitors re\-evaluate their attitudes towards finance, with one writing “ *The quote* *‘money is a matter of belief’ made me think about what ‘it’ actually is as it consumes our lives. It makes me want to ask many questions, like who issues it? Where does it come from?*” Another observed “ *After this exhibition I absolutely agree with the Occupy movement*” \(5.2a, p. 26\). 



 Events associated with *Show Me the Money* included *Shadow Money*, a free discussion on culture and economy at the John Hansard Gallery in October 2014 \(public attendance: 43\). Joining Crosthwaite and other panellists were artists Cornford & Cross, whose film *Black Narcissus* was commissioned for *Show Me the Money*’s “Framing Finance” theme. Described by the artist David Cross as “ *somehow conflating the idea of economic history with natural history … a kind of paradox that fascinates me*” \(5.3\), the immersive and panoramic film transforms a decade of FTSE 100 data into a dramatic mountain range. Describing the decision to use a still from *Black Narcissus* on the cover of the *Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation* \(2015, pictured right\), where it frames future financial regulators’ reading, the lead editor notes “ *we struggled for some time in finding an image that would reflect the dynamism, risks, and sometimes inherent dangers associated with financial markets …. \[This\] was a perfect representation of what we were seeking: an innovative, state\-of\-the\-art image of how a market might be represented*” \(5.4\). 

 Having initially aimed to increase the project’s reach by around 3,000 people, the team engaged over 17,000 with *Show Me the Money* through an interactive exhibition website and a free games\-based Apple and Android app. In addition to 16,952 unique website visitors between 2014 and 2020 \(5.5a\), there were 481 downloads of the app \(5.5b\) on which Crosthwaite worked closely with the developers; it received an average rating of 4.5/5 on iTunes \(5.5c\). As the researchers moved into their next collaboration, **The History of Financial Advice**, they drew on this learning in a teacher\-scholar programme \(funded by an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant \[GBP9,180\]\), which produced eight Key Stage 3 and 4 financial literacy lesson plans. The plans were awarded the Financial Education Quality Mark by the UK’s leading financial education charity, Young Money, in 2019. Freely accessible online since February 2020 \(5.6a\), and downloaded 1,091 times by December 2020 \(5.6b\), the resources have been described by Young Money as “ *a unique and important intervention*” into a challenging educational landscape, “ *important because of the way in which they \[draw\] upon a wide range of disciplines, including Literature, History and Visual Culture, \[allowing them\] to address the broader questions involved in financial citizenship – such as the conceptual nature of money and the distinctions between public and private forms of debt – that are increasingly pressing*” \(5.6c\). After COVID\-19\-related restrictions are lifted, the charity is planning to take the lesson plans forward in new stimulus materials for classroom use and teacher training activities in a follow\-up collaboration with the researchers. 

 To engage older audiences, the History of Financial Advice team worked with Edinburgh’s Library of Mistakes, which was founded by Didasko Education in 2013 to “improve financial understanding one mistake at a time”. Identifying around 100 classic financial advice books for a new library collection named after the project, the researchers also produced a 32 pp. illustrated Finder’s Guide, described in the *Financial Times* \(print circulation 180,053\) and *MoneyWeek* \(approximately 38,000\) as a gateway to “ *a few happy hours wandering through the books mentioned within*” \(5.7a; 5.7b\) in a long\-form article about lessons to be learned from the research, in which Crosthwaite is quoted. The project has also been covered by the BBC \(5.7c; 5.7d\), *Scottish Financial News* \(readership 15,000\+\) \(5.7e\) and *The Telegraph* \(approximately 320,000\) in an article based on an interview with Crosthwaite \(5.7f\). An article in the financial services trade magazine *The Edge* \(a supplement of *Master Investor Magazine* \[readership 3,000\]\) showcased the project’s findings concerning the starkly gendered rhetoric of the investment advice genre, and stressed the key claim of the team’s humanities\-based approach: that “ *this kind of thing matters … because language matters*” \(5.7g, p. 28 \[35\]\). The Keeper and Librarian of the Library of Mistakes have said that, as well as strengthening the collection and helping market the Library’s services, the Finder’s Guide in particular has been “ *proving to be a popular way for professionals in other sectors, such as public libraries, corporate information services and institutional collections, to highlight the Library of Mistakes to their own users*” \(5.8\). Feedback on the booked\-out collection launch organised by Crosthwaite in Edinburgh in December 2018 and attended by financial services professionals, finance academics and members of the public included comments such as “ *I was fascinated to learn about overlaps between financial advice, the self\-help genre, and even occult/magical thought*” and it “ *completely overturned my understanding of financial advice*” \(5.9a, p.4\). The team also communicated its findings to finance industry professionals at a CPD seminar held at the Chartered Insurance Institute in the City of London in May 2019, which included representatives from the Finance Foundation think tank and the Personal Investment Management and Financial Advice Association. 100% of questionnaire respondents reported an improved knowledge and understanding of the history of financial advice, with several noting how they could draw on the research in their professional practice, such as “ *supporting advisers in their approach to financial planning*” \(5.9b, p.8\). 

 In 2019, the University of Southampton launched a free, three\-week Massive Open Online Course \(MOOC\) on FutureLearn using material by Crosthwaite, Knight, Marsh, Paul and Taylor. *Understanding Money: The History of Finance, Speculation and the Stock Market* enrolled over 8,000 learners from 115 different countries across four runs between early 2019 and the end of 2020. In end\-of\-course surveys of the first three editions, 96% of participants reported that the course had given them new knowledge or skills, 73% that they had shared what they had learned with other people, and 43% that they had applied what they learned. Coded analysis of participants’ on\-course comments has further revealed that their learning was predominantly conceptual \(just over 82% of comments reflected new ideas or new ways of thinking or expressing thoughts\), with many participants specifically commenting on how learning about culture, literature and the arts had not only given them new knowledge about finance and the economy, but made them think differently about them \(“ *a totally new way of making more sense*” of “ *money \[and\] crashes*” \[5.10, p. 17\]\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Matthews, Neal and others in the Department of Social Statistics and Demography at the University of Southampton \(UoS\) have made their research on pregnancy and health among very young adolescents ‘count’ for teenagers around the world. 

 \(1\) By providing the first rigorous scientific evidence of the global extent of early adolescent pregnancy for girls aged 10\-15, UoS research directly influenced the creation and adoption of UN Sustainable Development Goal \(SDG\) indicator 3.7.2, which measures the early adolescent birth rate. 

 \(2\) This world\-leading UoS methodological research on the measurement of adolescent reproductive health has been complemented by their DFID\-funded action\-based research, documenting the most strategic use of evidence\-based advocacy and accountability to improve maternal and new\-born health outcomes in low income settings. These research findings have subsequently been utilised to drive funding, programmes and policy internationally, informing interventions in adolescent reproductive health as a direct result of countries implementing the new UN SDG. 

 UoS research has had a sustained influence on international policy in relation to adolescent reproductive health through the provision of robust evidence to underpin policy design and promote accountability, potentially improving the lives of millions of teenage girls worldwide.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **\(i\) Producing robust estimates of the scale of childbearing among young adolescents** 

 After completing her PhD \(supervised by **Professor Zoe** **Matthews**\) on the determinants of neonatal mortality in developing countries at UoS in 2009, **Dr Sarah Neal** was awarded a British Academy postdoctoral fellowship researching childbearing in very young adolescents \(under 16 years\) in developing countries \[ **G1**\]. This research identified pregnancy in early adolescence as a neglected area that affects millions of young girls worldwide. Each year, around two million girls give birth before the age of 16 years, with around half having their first birth before their 15th birthday. These young girls face specific and severe risks to their health and well\-being. 

 In 2010 Neal, Matthews and colleagues collaborated to produce the “Atlas of Birth,” which identified the largest health threats to young women and girls in low income countries \[ **3.1**\], highlighting that many maternal deaths were preventable. In 2012, Neal and Matthews led the development of the first comparative estimates on the scale of childbearing amongst young adolescents \[ **3.2**\]. Data was drawn from 42 large, nationally representative household surveys in low resource countries carried out since 2003 to present estimates of age\-specific birth rates for girls aged 12–15, and the percentage of girls who give birth before the age of 16. The highest rates were found in Sub\-Saharan Africa, where in Guinea, Mali, Mozambique, Niger and Sierra Leone more than 10% of girls become mothers before their 16<sup>th</sup> birthday \[ **3.2**\]. Research using data for 144 countries to produce disaggregated maternal mortality rates, and focussing adolescents, was then published in the Lancet Global in 2014 \[ **3.3**\]. Further research then highlighted that early childbearing is concentrated amongst the poorest and rural girls and in geographic “pockets” \[ **3.4**\]. 

 **\(ii\) Ensuring a place for adolescent health on global agendas; producing a new indicator for young adolescents** 

 In 2014 Neal and Matthews were invited to be members of the Expert Consultative Group on Adolescence, part of the UN Secretary General’s Global Strategy for Women and Children’s Health. The Group provided evidence to ensure the inclusion of adolescent health issues in the relaunch of the UN Global Strategy – timed to coincide with the ratification of the SDGs. Matthews and Neal conducted a review \[ **3.5**\] of evidence\-based inputs to inform expert meetings on adolescent health conducted by the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health \(PMNCH\) and the UN Population Fund \(UNFPA\) in 2015. Members of the Expert Group argued for the inclusion of a specific UN SDG indicator that would measure the birth rate to young adolescents. 

 **\(iii\) Providing evidence for action on adolescent reproductive health** 

 At the same time as Neal’s British Academy Fellowship, in 2011 other members of the Department’s Global Health research cluster, including Matthews and Professor Nyovani Madise, successfully secured a DFID\-funded research project “Evidence for Action”. This programme of research documented effective approaches to the strategic use of evidence\-based advocacy and accountability to improve maternal and new\-born health outcomes in six sub\-Saharan African countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania \[ **G2**\]. As part of this project, research on accountability for adolescent reproductive health was launched as part of the “MamaYe” initiative launched by Matthews, Dr Louise Hulton \(a previous PhD researcher at UoS\) and others. This research highlighted the positive impact that introducing evidence‐based accountability mechanisms at national and subnational levels can have in accelerating reductions in maternal and newborn mortality. This included applying specific examples of accountability interventions to catalyse change. \[ **3.6**\] 

 Building on earlier research on the 2010 Atlas of Birth, in 2015 Matthews secured a grant from the Norwegian Development Agency \(NORAD\) to examine the geography of maternal and newborn health \[ **G3**\]. This was followed in 2016 by an ESRC IAA grant to update and extend the earlier Atlas \[ **G4**\] which facilitated an interdisciplinary collaboration with Dr Kristine Nilsen \(returned in this UOA and whose postgraduate research was previously supervised by Matthews\) and Professor Andrew Tatem with colleagues from WorldPop, a UoS research group specializing in open spatial demographic data. This collaboration has generated novel data allowing “gridded” estimates of pregnancies for local areas \[ **3.7**\].  Adolescent childbearing is associated with a range of adverse outcomes for both the mother and infant, including neonatal mortality. The critical importance of reducing adolescent births among the youngest age group was confirmed by Neal’s 2018 article in PLOSOne that highlighted that the risk of neonatal mortality in 45 low and middle income countries was markedly higher for infants born to mothers aged under 15 in all regions \[ **3.8**\]. The many layers of data generated by the unique research collaboration at UoS have provided the evidence and insight to inform interventions by policy\-makers in international organisations, national governments and other agencies including charities and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impact 1: Influencing the creation and adoption of a new UN Sustainable Development Goal \(SDG\) indicator 3.7.2 – making the scale of childbearing among young adolescents visible** 

 Each year an estimated 16 million young women give birth between ages 15 and 19 and a further one million girls give birth before age 15, with 95% of these births taking place in low or middle income countries \[ **3.7**\], risking the lives of both the mother and child. Globally, neonatal deaths now make up 45% of all deaths in children under five. In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals were launched and signed by 201 nations including the pledge to improve the health of adolescents and end child marriage. Researchers at UoS directly influenced the development and adoption of the **SDG 3.7.2 indicator:** the adolescent birth rate. A key UN SDG development document \[ **5.1**\] cites two papers by **Neal** and **Matthews** on adolescent childbearing as underpinning its methodology. The indicator itself is publicly available by the UN on the UN SDG statistics site \[ **5.2**\]. The SDG 3.7.2 indicator is a Tier 1 indicator \(of the 3 Tiers in UN SDGs\) which is defined as ‘conceptually clear, established methodology and standards available and data regularly produced by countries’ \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **Matthews’** and **Neal’s** long\-standing networks and relationships with policy\-makers, advocates and social accountability actors, enabled them to influence the SDG process and other key events within global and national health arenas. The availability of reliable and robust statistics was crucial as childbearing in the early teenage years had been previously ignored or assumed as negligible. The process of developing indicators for the health\-related SDGs involved a series of high\-level meetings between UN agencies. A key player in negotiations was Dr Laura Laski, Head of Sexual and Reproductive Health at UNFPA at the time, who used Neal’s analyses to press for the inclusion of a measure on very young adolescent childbearing *.* 

 *‘This paper \[ **3.2**\] was a vital first step in getting the issue on very young adolescent pregnancy on the policy agenda and highlighting the need for age\-disaggregated adolescent fertility data’* \[ **5.3**\]. 

 International frameworks such as the SDGs are used as leverage to create change and incentivise governments and other key players at both national and international level. Prior to being defined as an SDG indicator, the early adolescent birth rate had not been adopted by any international monitoring system. The new measure, directly based on UoS research, provides indirect evidence of the abuse of human rights in adolescence, as fertility at that young age often indicates forced child marriage and sexual abuse. It also provides indirect evidence of adolescents’ access \(or lack thereof\) to sexual and reproductive health services. 

 The inclusion of a new indicator at such a high level of influence has increased the visibility and focussed policy, research and programme attention on the sexual and reproductive health of very young adolescents. According to a recent report on the impact of the inclusion of the early adolescent birth rate in the Sustainable Development Goals, more nations are now collecting data to measure the scale of adolescent programmes and developing new policies to address the issue. Over the period 2017\-2020, 14 countries submitted information about birth rates of younger adolescents in their SDG National Voluntary Reviews \(NVR\). Even more countries \(34\) reported that adolescent birth rates and child marriage are of concern for their young adolescent population, highlighting that the influence of the indicator’s inclusion is gathering momentum. \[ **5.4**\]. 

 In response to the inclusion of the adolescent birth rate as a monitoring indicator in the SDGs, the early adolescent fertility rate has become a part of the United Nations Evidence and Data for Gender Equality \(EDGE\) project. The UN has recently issued guidance on data collection for the 10\-15 years age group and the early adolescent birth rate is now part of the minimum set of indicators that countries should report on for gender equality assessment \[ **5.5**\]. **Neal** continues to provide advice on the development of international statistical infrastructures as a member of the UN Population Division Expert Group on Early Adolescent Fertility. 

 Since the introduction of the SDG indicator, UN Agencies, international organisations and national governments have supported research, policy change, and instituted programmes targeting adolescent girls under 16 years old. International NGOs such as Save the Children and the Population Council have developed information and resources related to this key group. 

 *… health, wellbeing and empowerment of women and girls \(particularly their reproductive health and rights\) is core to the work of the Population Council. Scholars at the University of Southampton Department of Social Statistics and Demography were among the first to study the reproductive health of adolescents \[ **3.3**\]. Their identification of the importance of the younger group of adolescents \(aged under 16\) \[ **3.2**\] has provided the main insight into the importance of the early teen years as the key to healthy reproductive lives…. These very vulnerable young girls face very specific risks and disadvantages to their health and wellbeing; yet until recently statistics for adolescent childbirth were rarely disaggregated by age. As a result, very early adolescent motherhood had previously been a hidden problem which had failed to gain the attention it deserves.”* \[ **5.6**\] 

 **Impact 2: ‘Evidence for Action’: improving adolescent and maternal health through increased accountability and measurement** 

 A core focus of the Global Health cluster has been to stimulate and support ‘Social and Technical Accountability in Health’. Producing reliable statistics can highlight inequalities and galvanise action for adolescents and other groups disadvantaged in realising good reproductive health. Using a range of accountability mechanisms, the group has created websites such as “The Atlas of Birth”, to ensure that accurate statistics are available and easily accessible to health workers, journalists, and health policy\-makers. The initial hard copy of the Atlas was published in 2010; the ESRC IAA grant \(2015\-16\) \[ **G4**\] enabled the Atlas to be both updated and made electronically available, extending its reach; from Nov 2016 to Dec 2020 the website has had over 2.4 million hits and 593,054 visits \[ **5.7**\]. The gridded maternal and new\-born health related datasets hosted by the “WorldPop” website containing births and pregnancy estimates for small areas were used by the UNFPA, WHO and International Confederation of Midwives in the State of the World’s Midwifery 2014 report, of which **Matthews** was a member of the core authorship team. 

 *Examples of their more recent work include the creation of high resolution maps of births under 16 years. They also produced an easily accessible platform under the Atlas of Birth project, launched in 2007. Collaborations to map the data with … WorldPop, have been included in country dashboards in the last two “State of the Worlds Midwifery” Reports. These mapped statistics help us identify where the workforce, such as midwives, are needed, and help to ensure that no\-one is left behind without essential health services in pregnancy.* Testimonial from UNFPA \[ **5.8**\] 

 Furthermore, the wider group led by Matthews, Hulton and others have built a social accountability movement called “MamaYe” in six African countries that has included public\-facing websites and media channels to give easy to understand information direct to the population, including adolescents themselves. This has been running for over a decade and is now fully locally owned. One exemplar is provided by the improvements in the district information system in Ghana, including dashboards and scoresheets \[ **3.6**\], with these now adapted to include an explicit focus on the under 16s \[ **5.4**\]. 

 *Perhaps their most impactful programme, however, has been the “Mamaye” movement created by Hulton, Matthews and colleagues initiated in 2009. This initiative is still active today and was a fresh approach throughout its inception and beyond \- creating impact in the original six countries as well as others that have subsequently also emulated the social accountability model.* \[ **5.9**\] 

 By providing evidence on both the extent of adolescent pregnancy \[ **3.2**\] and its impact, including the heightened risk of neonatal mortality \[ **3.7**\], the body of research at UoS has meant that adolescent \(sexual and reproductive\) health is now firmly on the international agenda. 

 *“the team at the University of Southampton have made a significant contribution to put adolescence on the agenda of Women and Children’s’ Health in the UN, as well as on multiple national development plans…. the work of the Southampton team has been shown not only to galvanize indicators and data on the international scene, its impact has also reached into countries and into the lives of adolescents in many communities”*. Testimonial from PMNCH/WHO \[ **5.9**\] 

 Importantly, it is now a core component of the UN’s current programme as illustrated in the upcoming Special Session at the UN General Assembly on the wellbeing of Adolescents. 

 *‘… We are currently facilitating and supporting UN Member States to get a UN Declaration on adolescent well\-being passed at the UN General Assembly in 2022 or 2023, where governments, civil society, multi\-lateral agencies, the private sector, and youth networks can make political and financial pledges for adolescents’ well\-being policies and programmes **. Neal, Matthews et al’s work and research has been a lynch pin in all of the above**. Neal’s involvement continues as she is a critical part of the International Reference Group for Adolescent Wellbeing.’* Testimonial from PMNCH/WHO \[ **5.9**\] 

 UoS research is playing a vital role in driving international funding decisions and informing national policy and programmes designed to reduce adolescent births, as a direct result of countries implementing the new UN SDG. The work supports gender equity and improves the lives of teenage girls and their infants in low and middle income countries.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The search for exoplanets has been one of the most exciting areas of astrophysics over the last three decades. The University of Hertfordshire’s Centre for Astrophysics Research \(CAR\), through its development of novel data analysis algorithms and software, has played a central role in some of the most high\-profile exoplanetary discoveries in recent years. Evidenced through traditional media and social media metrics, these findings, including the identification of the ‘super Earth’ Proxima b in the habitable zone of the nearest star, have inspired ongoing debate in the public sphere about the nature and significance of these new worlds, engaging a global audience in the tens of millions. The effects have been: an increase in public awareness, curiosity and understanding of what lies beyond our own solar system; significant influence over the objectives of three pioneering exoplanetary exploration missions, including a $100m funded initiative; and the creation of new digital and artistic works designed to further fire the public imagination.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The discovery of planets beyond the solar system is widely recognised as having changed the way we view the Universe and our place within it. CAR researchers have played a significant role in shaping this new view using a wide variety of different techniques. Examples from the start of the research period are the pioneering of the precise measurement of polarisation in stars and star forming regions by developing instrumentation \[ **3.1**\] providing evidence for the low albedos of planets such as 51 Pegasi b and for the origin of homochirality in space as well as discoveries of free\-floating planets sometimes known as rogue planets. They have published more than 200 peer\-reviewed exoplanet\-related journal papers.  Here we emphasise the impact of CAR researchers in the development of novel algorithmic methods to facilitate some of the most high\-profile recent exoplanet discoveries around the closest stars to our solar system. 

 This area of research entered a new phase in 2004 with the appointment of Jones and Pinfield. Jones had previously co\-founded the Anglo\-Australian Planet Search, a long\-term survey to catalogue planets around 240 nearby stars of the southern hemisphere. This work was funded at Hertfordshire by the STFC \[ **G1, G2**\]. Pinfield led the EU\-FP7 Rocky Planets Around Cool Stars programme \[ **G3**\] expanding support for this work and used the 4\-metre UK Infrared Telescope to search for potentially habitable exoplanets at, for the first time, infrared wavelengths. Combined, these programmes allowed CAR researchers to develop and refine new algorithms to maximise the sensitivity for identifying exoplanets. In particular, this case study focuses on results from the radial velocity method: the identification of an orbiting planet from the ‘wobble’ of a star by the detection of small shifts in its spectral features. 

 Tuomi, Jones and Anglada\-Escudé identified initial evidence of exoplanets around two of the closest stars to the Sun – Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti \[ **3.2**, **3.3**\]. They secured a Leverhulme grant PANDORA \[ **G4**\] to systematically reprocess and combine different high\-resolution radial velocity datasets in order to test for signals. Refinement of their analytical techniques led to Tuomi, with Anglada\-Escude and Jones, winning an international challenge competition in 2014\-15 to push the boundaries of the radial velocity method \[ **3.4**\]. This led to the ground\-breaking discovery of a rocky, Earth\-sized planet, named Promixa b, orbiting the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri 4.2 light years from Earth. It was published in *Nature* in 2016 \[ **3.5**\], featuring on the front cover. Tuomi had first submitted the paper in 2013 after combining data taken by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher \(HARPS\) at the La Silla Observatory and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Paranal Observatory in Chile. However, more evidence was requested by referees to conclusively show that the ‘wobble’ was a planetary signal, as opposed to stellar activity. PANDORA enabled the development of further analysis techniques and Anglada\-Escudé \(who gained a full\-time lectureship at Queen Mary University of London in September 2015\) to co\-ordinate the Pale Red Dot observing campaign including 30 scientists from eight countries. This enabled the team to obtain new datasets from other telescopes and ,in particular, a landmark campaign using HARPS to carry out regular observations for 60 nights. They were able to unequivocally confirm the planetary signal. An international team including Jones made further improvements to the reprocessing of the Proxima Centauri radial velocity data which further validated the signal, and the team announced a possible second planet – Proxima c – in *Science Advances* in 2020. 

 In 2018 an international team announced the discovery of a frozen planet orbiting Barnard’s Star, the next closest star system to the Sun after the Alpha Centauri triple star system. Again, the fingerprints of the planet, named Barnard’s Star b, were first identified by Tuomi using UH’s radial velocity method to analyse combined data from spectrometers based around the world. Another large\-scale collaboration and dedicated observing campaign coordinated by Anglada\-Escudé at QMUL, this time with the newly commissioned Spanish spectrograph CARMENES, confirmed the planetary signal and the results were published in *Nature* \[ **3.6**\]. 

 Other key milestones included the discovery in 2017 of four Earth\-sized planets orbiting Tau Ceti, 12 light years away from Earth. Two of them are located in the habitable zone \[ **3.7**\]. These discoveries built on the methods to combine multiple datasets distinguishing periodic signals from correlated noise to reveal previously hidden planets \[C, D\]. Feng, Tuomi and Jones packaged the winning software into a publicly available tool called Agatha \[ **3.8**\]. This software has now been automated and extended \(Agatha 2 and PEXO\), enabling a new generation of exoplanet discoveries.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CAR research has made a fundamental contribution to the most high\-profile exoplanetary discoveries in recent years. The identification of the exoplanet Proxima b, orbiting the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, attracted one of the highest levels of online attention out of all journal articles tracked by Altmetric, prompting comment from UK Government ministers on the UK’s science leadership role. It reached a global audience in the tens of millions and a social media audience close to seven million over a four\-year period. The in\-depth and sustained nature of the ensuing debate over the potential for life on exoplanets more generally has increased public interest in, and understanding of, our place in the wider universe. The research findings have shaped the core objectives of high\-profile interstellar space missions and inspired creative digital and artistic works designed to stimulate further public enjoyment of astrophysics. 

 **Increasing public understanding and stimulating curiosity about our place in the universe** 

 CAR researchers have proactively engaged with the media to maximise the impact of their discoveries and respond to strong public interest. Articles have featured explanations from CAR researchers about their data analysis techniques and what their findings mean in the context of the search for extra\-terrestrial life. The *reach* of the Proxima b discovery is evidenced through Altmetric data for the 2016 *Nature* paper \[ **3.6**\], \[ **5.1**\]. Its ‘Attention Score’ of 2566 \(at 31 Dec 2020\) – Altmetric’s high\-level measure of the quality and quantity of online attention received – means the paper’s public reach is ranked 1,184th out of a total 16.6 million outputs ever tracked; 17th out of 267,500 outputs of a similar age, and 5th out of 984 Nature outputs of a similar age. From the announcement of the discovery on 23 August 2016 to 31 December 2020, the paper was cited directly in 305 stories from 225 outlets around the world. It was referenced directly in 1,093 tweets from 1,049 users \(77% were members of the public\), reaching an audience size ‘with an upper bound’ of 6.9m people. According to Altmetric, **3.6** is cited on 15 Wikipedia pages, including the pages for ‘Exoplanet’ and ‘Solar System’; *Science Magazine* named it in its top ten scientific discoveries of 2016. Many other media articles and social media coverage have discussed Proxima b without directly citing **3.6**, so the discovery’s public reach is, in reality, much wider than Altmetric data can demonstrate. This allows a confident estimate that the total audience size reached over the impact period was in the many tens of millions. 

 The in\-depth, sustained media coverage and the themes it explored serve to demonstrate the *significance* of the impact \[ **5.2**\]. Articles reacting to the discovery discussed our place in the wider universe, the next age of space discovery and the possibility of life beyond Earth. *The Economist* devoted its front cover and leader to the Proxima b paper \[ **3.6**\] with the headline *Brave New Worlds – Pioneers, Planets and the next Space Age*. It said: ‘… *a new phase in the search for life elsewhere is about to begin*’ and compiled a guide ‘ *How to find exoplanets*’. Its leader article read: ‘ *New discoveries, intelligent devices and irrepressible dreamers are once again making space exciting*.’ Calling Proxima b ‘ *the planet we’ve all been waiting for*’, *New Scientist* wrote: ‘ *getting to Proxima b might become an existential requirement*’ and ‘ *finding out more about the planet should be a high priority*’. Coverage focused on whether Proxima b could host life. The likes of *BBC News* and the *Guardian* published videos of an artist’s representation of Proxima b. The BBC’s Science Editor called the discovery ‘ *a huge moment in the search for alien worlds*’ and said, ‘ *the fact that it is so close to us \- in the relative terms of deep space \- suddenly improves the chances of investigating if an exoplanet can be genuinely habitable*’. The *Guardian* included this independent quote: ‘ *It will be our prime laboratory for the search for extra\-terrestrial life for the decades ahead.’* The continued impact of the discovery itself on public knowledge and understanding of exoplanets is evidenced by the depth and breadth of follow\-on coverage; the debate over whether Proxima b could potentially support life played out in the public sphere, via mainstream and social media, for the remaining four years of the impact period \[ **5.2**\]. In 2017, the Financial Times reported that the Met Office had forecast the weather on Proxima b \(mostly dry, with heavy rainfall in two tropical zones\) and in 2020 NASA published its own climate simulations that explored a range of habitable climate scenarios \[ **5.2**\]. 

 The announcement in August 2017 of the discovery of four Earth\-sized worlds orbiting Tau Ceti also attracted significant and sustained public attention. According to Altmetric data \[ **5.3**\], paper **3.6** was covered in 68 news stories from 56 news outlets and reached up to 145,000 people through 71 tweets from 58 users. An article in *Scientific American* said the finding ‘ *seems to be at least as interesting as the Alpha Centauri stars*’. Popular US online magazine *Daily Beast* in 2018 underlined the scale of the research effort, saying: ‘ *Feng’s work on the Tau Ceti system last year stretched radial velocity to its absolute limits*.’ The *Nature* paper on Barnard’s Star \[ **3.7**\], published in November 2018, received an Altmetric attention score of 1,445. It was covered in 139 stories from 113 news outlets and reached an audience with an upper bound of 4.5m via 963 tweets from 852 users \[ **5.3**\]. The debate over whether Barnard’s Star b could potentially support life continued for the rest of the impact period \[ **5.4**\]. In 2019 the Proxima b and Barnard’s Star b papers were included in Nature’s public\-facing online collection of 43 articles on exoplanets to celebrate the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics \[ **5.5**\]. Nature wrote: “ *Together, these discoveries have changed the way we view the Universe, and our place within it*.” 

 Tuomi and Feng directly engaged the public in the search for exoplanets through articles for the online Pale Red Dot initiative, for which Tuomi was on the editorial team \[ **5.6**\]. This was a public engagement campaign to inspire people in astrophysics and STEM and reveal processes behind the science. Between 2016 and 2018 the Pale Red Dot campaign was followed by 3,711 people on Facebook and 3,100 people on Twitter. A live public Q&A with members of the Pale Red Dot editorial team about the Proxima b discovery was conducted through the popular online forum Reddit, hosted by AskScience \(which has 20.3m members on the platform\). The thread resulted in more than 1,000 questions and comments and attracted 9,600 likes \[ **5.6**\]. The Pale Red Dot Campaign won the Research Impact Award at the Guardian University Awards 2017 \[ **5.6**\]. 

 **Inspiring and shaping the objectives of space missions beyond our solar system** 

 UK Government ministers cited the Proxima b discovery as evidence of UK’s global leadership role in science \[ **5.7**\]. In the STFC media release, in which Jones and Tuomi were quoted, the Science Minister said: “ *The discovery of Proxima b adds to what has already been a momentous year for UK space research, and our global leadership in science and innovation.*” The Business Secretary said the finding was “ *testament to the hard work and scientific endeavour of UK institutions who are leading the charge and making discoveries that could change lives and inspire millions around the world.*” In fact, the identification of Proxima b also had a clear practical impact: it inspired or shaped the key objectives of three high\-profile space missions. 

 The discovery of Proxima b has shaped a multi\-million\-dollar programme to develop nano ‘space probes’ capable of reaching the Alpha Centauri system in just 20 years \[ **5.8**\]. With initial funding of $100m from Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, the Breakthrough Starshot project was launched by Milner, Zuckerberg and Hawking in 2016. Proxima b has become the initiative’s chief target. The project, which has received widespread media coverage, is ‘ *aiming to demonstrate proof of concept for light\-propelled spacecraft that could fly at 20 percent of light speed and, in just over 20 years after their launch, capture images and other measurements of the exoplanet Proxima b*’ \[ **5.8**\]. The *New Scientist* quoted the head of Breakthrough Starshot’s advisory board as saying: ‘ *It \(Proxima b\) shows that there is a target we can go and visit*.’ A presenter for The Sky at Night told the Guardian: ‘ *I think just having a target to aim for will inspire more. Now we know it’s there, surely we have to go?*’ \[ **5.8**\] The mission to Proxima b was explored in a 90\-minute BBC2 documentary screened in 2017 called *The Search for a New Earth*, co\-presented by Hawking \[ **5.8**\]. In 2017, *New Scientist* reported that NASA had begun plans for an interstellar space mission in 2069 to mark the 100th anniversary of the first moon landing. Proxima b is its key target \[ **5.8**\]. The discovery of Proxima b also inspired Project Blue, a mission to take the first image of an earth\-like planet in the Alpha Centauri star system. Covered by *Science* magazine and the BBC’s *Science Focus*, Project Blue aims to build and launch a compact telescope to image the habitable zones of the nearest Sun\-like stars to Earth \[ **5.8**\]. The identification of Proxima b demonstrated what might be possible. According to Project Blue: ‘ *… we now know that there’s a terrestrial\-class planet orbiting one of the stars in the Alpha Centauri system. This makes us optimistic that there could be other rocky planets orbiting Alpha Cen A and B*.’ \[ **5.8**\] 

 **Inspiring new creative digital and artistic outputs that engage the public imagination** 

 The discovery of Proxima b resulted in the creation of artistic representations of the exoplanet, further engaging the public imagination in what a rocky, Earth\-like planet four light years away might look like. A video titled *The exoplanet next door*, published by Nature on YouTube to accompany **3.6**, received 610,000 views, 3,400 likes and 861 comments \[ **5.9**\]. There are numerous creative digital animations and HD footage depicting Proxima b on YouTube. As an example, one video published by science channel *What If* in 2020, titled *What If We Relocated Humanity to Proxima B?*, received 1.3m views, 31,000 likes and 3,900 comments \[ **5.9**\]. In 2017 a documentary film on Proxima b – Journey to the Pale Red Dot – was broadcast on Amazon’s Prime Video \(it was still on the platform at the end of the impact period\) \[ **5.9**\]. In August 2020, NASA released an artist’s impression of a view of the surface of the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri \[ **5.9**\]. In December 2020, an artist partnering with the same NASA team that announced the 2069 interstellar mission announced she was developing sound artwork ‘Tree of Life’ to be sent to Proxima b – a deliberate reference to the Golden Record, a phonograph record sent into space on NASA’s Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977 \[ **5.9**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The fast\-evolving field of artificial intelligence \(AI\) raises serious ethical questions. As one of the foremost experts in the ethics of AI, Professor Floridi’s theoretical and applied research has resulted in changed ethical AI policies for international actors including Microsoft and Ernst & Young. It has also contributed to guidelines for analysing and resolving ethical problems concerning personal data and AI in collaboration with the Alan Turing Institute, Digital Catapult, the House of Lords, the House of Commons, the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK, the European Commission, and the Vatican.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The information revolution is changing the world profoundly, irreversibly, at a breath\-taking pace, and with an unprecedented scope. Floridi has spearheaded a number of advances in the Philosophy of Information. Specifically, he has demonstrated the need to rethink the way we conceptualize our individual reality, what it means to be human in the digital age, how philosophy needs to approach the information age, and what ethical analyses can do to adapt. 

  

 In his book <ins>The Fourth Revolution \- How the Infosphere is Reshaping Human Reality</ins>, Floridi shows that recent technologies have blurred the lines between online and offline worlds \[1\]. This has changed the answer to the fundamental question of who we are and how we relate to each other more than previous technological advances. In addition to coining new words and expressions that have become widely adopted such as “infosphere”, “fourth revolution”, “inforg”, and “conceptual design”, his work demonstrated that the creation, management, and utilisation of online platforms, data, and algorithms vital issues. 

 In his book <ins>The Logic of Information</ins>, Floridi has proposed a new way of philosophising to address the changed information\-driven world in which we live \[2\]. His starting point is that reality provides the data which constrains affordances. We then transform these into information, like semantic engines. Such transformation or repurposing is not equivalent to portraying, or picturing, or photographing, or photocopying anything. It is more like cooking: the dish does not represent the ingredients, it uses them to make something else out of them, yet the reality of the dish and its properties hugely depend on the reality and the properties of the ingredients. A corollary is that models are not representations understood as pictures, but interpretations understood as data elaborations, of systems. In brief, Floridi articulates and defends the thesis that knowledge is design and philosophy is the ultimate form of conceptual design. In many ways, Floridi’s proposal is a break from traditions based on Aristotelian metaphysics or the ‘linguistic turn’ and affirms the central role of conceptual clarification and refinement in philosophy. 

 Floridi has also illustrated a number of ways in which our outpaced understanding of the infosphere’s nature and consequences demands that we change the way we analyse them ethically. His contributions in this area include a number of influential publications in the growing field of digital ethics \[3\-6\]. Digital ethics is the branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to data \(including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing and use\), algorithms \(including artificial intelligence, artificial agents, machine learning and robots\) and corresponding practices \(including responsible innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes\), in order to formulate and support morally good solutions \(e.g. right conducts or right values\). The ethical challenges with which it deals can be mapped within the conceptual space delineated by three axes of research: the ethics of data, the ethics of algorithms, and the ethics of practices. His views on ethics were summarized in his 2018 paper “AI4People—An Ethical Framework for a Good AI Society: Opportunities, Risks, Principles, and Recommendations.” In the paper, he and the co\-authors note the need to apply traditional ethical principles, and propose an additional one: explicability, understood as \(i\) explainability of AI for the expert and \(ii\) transparency of AI for the non\-expert \[3\]. 

 In other publications, Floridi has argued that AI can be a great force for good, \[4\] provided that it is properly regulated \[5\], and especially if ethical considerations are built into the design of new technologies \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Floridi’s research on the need to address novel ethical problems thrown up by digital technologies has contributed to the way in which organizations \(government and business\) should anticipate and cope with the rapid changes in the field of technology. Specifically, his work on the philosophy and ethics of information has ""influenced the influencers"", that is, the way in which important actors \(such as the European Commission and companies such as Microsoft\) deal with digital challenges. 

 **Influencing government policy regarding socially responsible Artificial Intelligence** 

  

 As Chair of the project “AI4People”, the first project on socially good AI in Europe \(funded by the Atomium think tank and established in June 2017\), Floridi led the first, comparative analysis of international standards and principles about an ethical framework for AI. The research \[3\] identified 47 different principles and synthesized them into five. Four were very close to standard bioethics principles and a new one was added regarding explicability \(requiring that the issues be explained in a way that relevant stakeholders understand\). The work then recommended 20 practical policies to the European Commission \[A\]. The guidance has influenced policy in the UK, for example by changing the thinking of Members of Parliament and policy documents that government in the UK and EU use to audit AI technologies \[B\]. Lord Clement\-Jones of the House of Lords, for example, affirms that Floridi’s work has “had a major impact on the wider government, business, and academic community” \[B\]. 

  

 **Translating government policy into action in the fight against COVID\-19 and beyond** 

  

 Floridi is a founding board member of the UK Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation \(CDEI\). This Centre was established in 2018 to provide the UK Government with access to independent, impartial and expert advice on the ethical and innovative deployment of data and artificial intelligence. Floridi has provided key insights to their methodology, including by providing their definition of ‘data ethics’ \[C, p.2\]. This methodology informs all their work and Floridi has been an active member of all the meetings where a number of changes have been introduced. An interim report on progress notes that the Centre has worked: \(i\) with the Home Office to reduce bias \[D, p.11\]; \(ii\) with the Behavioural Insights Team to research public perceptions of the fairness of credit ratings and improve financial decision\-making \[D, p.14\]; and \(iii\) with govern\-mental recruitment where they are developing bias\-mitigating approaches \[D, p.15\]. Floridi also set up an AI Ethics committee for Digital Catapult in 2018 \[E\]. The Chair of the CDEI noted that Floridi has also played a role in ensuring that technologies used to combat COVID\-19 are ethical: 

 *I would also like to mention his work during the COVID\-19 pandemic to help ensure that the UK’s use of digital technologies in combating the disease is subject to ethical challenge and debate.* \[F\] 

 Specifically Floridi has influenced the ethics of technologies being used in the COVID\-19 era serving in 2020 on the ethics advisory board for NHSX during the development of the NHS contact tracing app \[G\]. In written evidence to the UK Parliament, it was minuted that: 

  

 *The creation by NHSX of an Ethics Advisory Board, chaired by the previous head of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Professor Sir Jonathan Montgomery to provide advice and recommendations to the app oversight board is welcomed. Having leading experts such as Professor Luciano Floridi, … is very positive. This is a great example of collaboration between the NHSX and the CDEI.* \[H, p. 5\] 

  

 Floridi has also influenced the Vatican’s official position on the ethics of high\-tech research. President of the Vatican’s ‘Pontificia Academia Pro Vita’, stated “thanks to \[Floridi’s\] influential contribution about ethics in hi\-tech research, the Academy published an international statement on AI Ethics \[known as\] Rome Call.” The statement supports an ethical approach to AI and is designed to promote a sense of responsibility among organisations, governments and institutions. Signed by The Pontifical Academy for Life, Microsoft, IBM, FAO and the Italian Government, the President of the Pontifical Academy goes on to state, “…the importance of Prof. Floridi’s support is that this document was approved and signed by the FAO General Director \[and\] by the President of Microsoft… on February 28th, 2020 and it was officially delivered to the Holy Father Pope Francis.” \[I\] 

  

 **Shaping corporate responsibility in AI design and innovation** 

  

 Floridi has helped some of the most important organisations in the digital industry, advising them about corporate responsibility in the design, development and deployment of AI systems. For example, the Senior Director of European Government Affairs, Rule of Law and Responsible Tech at Microsoft, stated: 

  

 *It would not be an overstatement to say that Professor Floridi’s research, projects and work have tremendously contributed to our own thinking.* \[J\] 

  

 Floridi wrote the foreword to Microsoft’s vision for the future of technology and AI, published in 2018. \[K\] Floridi has also influenced the way Ernst and Young evaluate critical ethical challenges posed by AI by being a member of a panel which “establishes governance and controls necessary for building and maintaining trust in AI systems”. \[L\] 

  

 With the aim of making his contributions to the ethics of AI and other technologies sustainable into the future, Floridi recently co\-founding of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, whose aim is to help corporations and governments develop ethical regulations surrounding AI  \[M\]. The Institute is new and is already gaining traction. For example, Darren Jones MP, who is a founding member of the Institute, joined legislators from across the world in Paris in February 2020 to take part in the inaugural meeting of the Global Parliamentary Network working group on Artificial Intelligence, which was hosted by the Institute \[M, p.5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our collaborative research together with students demonstrated that poor diet and lifestyle habits put young adults at risk of developing noncommunicable diseases. This case study documents the improvement of the university’s health promotion practice in response to local research, through improving infrastructure for assessment of physical health, systematic promotion of healthier food options, improving cooking skills, and improving food provision and catering services. The above conceptual framework was submitted to the Healthy Universities network and became a resource toolkit for changing practice based on local assessments, while it was also discussed with stakeholders to influence the national debate and practice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The transition period into young adulthood is a critical time for establishment of lifelong healthy habits. The UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey \(NDNS\) has identified that the youngest adults \(i.e. aged 18 \- 24 years\) consumed larger quantities of high calorie, high\-fat foods and fewer portions of fruits and vegetables than other adults. The Health Survey for England \(HSE\) also showed that the adults within the youngest age category consumed, on average, three portions of fruit and vegetables per day; far less than the UK's recommendation of ‘Five\-a\-day’, referring to eating at least five portions \(400g\) of fruit and vegetables. Most University Students \(USs\) belong to this age group, and this makes British USs a group potentially vulnerable to positive energy balance and consequently at risk of developing health complications such as obesity and its associated comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer later in life. 

 The project CINSYA \(Collaborative Investigation on the Nutritional Status of Young Adults\) was designed to actively engage students in practical perspectives of conducting research and delivering health promotion based on local need assessments. The project is innovative because of the extensive involvement of undergraduate students in design, delivery and dissemination, and their unique involvement in the development of health promotion activities. This project has been running for several years \(since 2014\), hosting several final year undergraduate research projects, dissertations, and voluntary summer placements. 

 As part of CINSYA, we examined more than 550 USs in a cross\-sectional study in the city of Liverpool, UK. We collected the demographic data \(using validated questionnaires of the NDNS\), assessed body composition \(via using a multi\-frequency bioelectrical impedance\), diet and physical activity \(through three days integrated diet and physical activity diary\), and blood biomarkers. We then examined gender and socioeconomic variations to understand health and nutritional status of our USs and consider the key strategic areas of focus for developing health promotion interventions. 

 The physiological assessments demonstrated that more than half of our local population were at risk of developing metabolic syndrome \(i.e. demonstrated at least one cardiometabolic risk factor\). Among the risk factors, abdominal obesity \(especially abnormalities in waist circumference indices\), hypertension and dyslipidaemia \(typically represented by abnormalities in circulatory lipoproteins\) were the most frequent risk factors. This is an important finding considering that young adults who develop metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes in later life, while it is also worthy of note that the above risk factors are modifiable and strongly associated with poor dietary and lifestyle choice. The separate analysis of the dietary data also confirmed that poor quality of diet, in particular, has substantially contributed to several inadequate micronutrients’ intake within our local USs population, while the subgroups analysis demonstrated that with increasing weight amongst the USs, the quality of diet decreases. 

 A package of interventions was developed together with students to enhance the nutritional status of the university students through change of practice.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In this case study, we report change in practice of health promotions in response to the assessment of nutritional status of USs. The impact case study uses the definition of Impact on ‘students’ within and beyond the submitting HEI \(Paragraph 300 b \- Guidance on Submission\), first to establish the improvement of practice at Liverpool Hope University \(LHU\), and then impact beyond LHU, through offering a conceptual framework for development of evidence\-based health promotion activities based on local assessment of nutritional status. 

1.  **Improvement of Practice within Liverpool Hope University** 

 *1.1 Improving infrastructure for assessment of physical health* 

 To address hypertension and increased cardiometabolic risk reported in our research, we installed a fully automated blood pressure monitor in the School of Health Sciences for self\-screening of staff and students. During the open days, applicant days, school visits and events, a complementary self\-assessment of blood pressure was made available to all staff, students and visitors. We also delivered complementary health screening for young adults during the Freshers Fair and Science Week, providing opportunities for anthropometric assessments and measurement of blood biomarkers of glucose and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we strategically promoted the work of Tim Cogley Cardiac Screening Foundation \(https://www.timcogleyfoundation.com, a charity affiliated with Liverpool Hope University, supporting free health screening for young adults\) and proactively supported the complementary Cardiac Screening offered. 

 *1.2 Systematically promoting healthier options* 

 We produced a guide for ‘Eating Well’ for students in close collaboration with nutrition students. This was made available to more than 6000 students through the University website \(S1\). As part of the resources for the ‘Eating Well’, a ‘Student’s Guide to Nutrition, with recipes, tips and ideas’ were produced as an outcome of an organic collaboration between registered nutritionists, nutrition students and the student support and wellbeing team of the student administration \(S2\). The PDF copy of the guide was sent to all new students \(more than 1000 students/year\) by email and widely distributed to all halls of residences of the university as hard copy, while printed recipe\-cards using recipes from the guide were given out at student events, which produced very positive feedback. This is an example of feedback received from a fresher student:""…the section on ‘ *tips to keep your bills down’ and ‘shopping tips’ provided some new and useful information. As a student that lives away from home, this was very handy \[and also\] as a food shopper that was not used to shopping before. This was a handy guide \[Immediately\] before starting university when trying to get an idea of healthy meal plans and recipe\(s\), as I had not done this before it was useful for inspiration and ideas""* \(S3\). 

 *1.3 Improving infrastructure for enhancement of Cooking Skills* 

 Food Preparation and Cooking workshops were produced and delivered as part of the Let’s Get Cooking programme \(in collaboration with Mersey Waste Munchers project\) for students in their first year of study, to improve cooking confidence and basic cooking skills, with the pledge that students also cascade the message via teaching cooking skills to their friends and classmates. The British Dietetic Association praises our work as an exemplar of *‘Food Sharing Social Success’* and students involved reported an increase in cooking confidence, cooking for friends and increased consumption of vegetables \[S4\]. 

 *1.4 Improving the Food Provision and Catering Services* 

 Nutrition academics and students spent time with the catering staff to discuss the specific nutritional and health issues of young adults, as a result of which the catering staff made changes to the environment with product placement and marketing images to promote healthy choices and consider health and food sustainability in food provision. In view of the discussions, several of the in\-house catering recipes for food and drinks prepared on campus were nutritionally analysed using professional dietary analysis software. Chefs and catering assistants were provided with this information together with suggestions for potential changes to recipes, and used this information to improve the nutritional quality of the recipes \(S5\). The discussions between the research team and catering staff, shaped a close and continuous dialogue and collaboration on the integration of best practice guidelines in catering and nutrition, reducing the portion size of energy dense foods, students placements and knowledge transfer partnerships \(S6\). 

1.  **Improvement of Practice beyond Liverpool Hope University** 

 *2.1 Promoting the change of Practice in the Healthy Universities Network* 

 The Healthy Universities is a well\-established network of 97 British HEIs and several international associate\-member organisations that advocate using holistic understanding of health, and a whole university approach for systematic health promotion. We submitted a case study to champion improving the health promotion practice based on local assessment of nutritional status. The case study received inspiring praise from the network’s professorial chair, for *""commitment to whole university approach, cooperative approach for working with students at all stages of the process, and range of practical responses to the research""* \(S7\) and became part of the Toolkits and Resources of the Healthy Universities \(S8\). 

 *2.2. Disseminating the new Practice amongst Students and Practitioners, the Policy makers, and the Public* 

 The research findings, together with the subsequent evidence\-based change in university practices \(in response to the local assessment of the Nutritional status of the USs\) were presented within a keynote speech at the Westminster Higher Education Forum to bring the matter to the attention of the member of Parliament and the policy makers \(S9\). This was also presented as part of the Continuous Professional Development accredited study day of the Association for Nutrition, sharing the knowledge with practitioners, registrants of the Association for Nutrition and the Nutrition Students across the Northwest England and beyond through delivery of an online Facebook Live talk \(S9\), while also promoted in local community and received coverage from media \(S10\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study demonstrates Dr Crowley’s impact on trade policy post\-Brexit. Firstly, Crowley used her research and expertise to support the building of essential trade policy capacity in Whitehall, in the wake of the decision to leave the European Union \(EU\) in 2016. Secondly, Crowley provided the research backing for the creation of an independent Trade Remedies Authority that has been enshrined into the Trade Bill \(2017\-2019 and 2019\-2021\), allowing the United Kingdom \(UK\) to minimize the economic cost of future trade shocks by enabling temporary tariffs without breaking World Trade Organization \(WTO\) rules. Lastly, Crowley made policy recommendations, designed to preserve animal welfare standards in food production for imports, that were included in the National Food Strategy \(July 2020\). 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The decision to leave the EU in 2016 created an urgent need for research to inform the development of an independent UK trade policy, and for research to help build trade policy capacity. Crowley’s research at Cambridge brings together deep economic, institutional, and legal knowledge about the details of how trade policy is conducted and negotiated in practice under the constraints imposed by the WTO \[ **R2**\] with timely research on exporters’ response to trade policy uncertainty \[ **R5**\]. 

 <ins>Trade policy capacity</ins> 

 Trade policy is complex and the devil is in the detail. Research conducted by Crowley at Cambridge \[ **R2**\] explores the functioning of trade agreements and the details of trade policy in the world trading system. The research \[ **R2**\] provides a comprehensive assessment of trade policy for 58 high, middle, and low\-income countries **.** \[ **R2**\] integrates findings from previous work with new data to address five questions about contemporary trade policy which are essential building blocks for designing policy: \(1\) Do some countries have more liberal trading regimes than others? \(2\) Within countries, which industries receive the most import protection? \(3\) How do trade policies change over time? \(4\) Do countries discriminate among their trading partners when setting trade policy? \(5\) How liberalized is world trade? The multiplicity of overlapping and intersecting agreements governing trade as well as national, regional, and sectoral variation in how policies are implemented imply that assessing and designing trade policy is complex. \[ **R5**\] quantifies the importance for exporters of having a trade policy framework that reduces uncertainty about tariffs and other trade costs. 

 <ins>The social value of trade remedies</ins> 

 Research by Crowley \[ **R1**\] makes a positive case for the use of trade remedies that allow governments to impose specific bilateral import restrictions within the larger context of the WTO agreement. The conventional wisdom in the academic literature, as represented, for example, by the influential article by Staiger and Wolak in Brookings Papers on Economic Activity from 1994, is that trade remedies raise costs for consumers and reduce welfare. Contrary to this, Crowley’s research \[ **R1**\] shows that trade remedies serve a socially beneficial function in multilateral trade agreements. They help countries to maintain their international commitment to free trade in the face of unexpected import volume shocks that cause temporary losses to domestic industries. The research \[ **R1**\] demonstrates that the optimally designed trade agreement will build\-in mechanisms for temporary and partial reductions in the degree of free trade among countries. Although such temporary trade remedies do have some negative impacts as suggested by conventional wisdom, they are desirable because they facilitate a more liberal trade policy than could otherwise be maintained. The direct policy implication of this research is that trade remedies are an important part of a country’s trade policy; a corollary is that limiting their use can undermine the larger multilateral system of liberal trade. 

 <ins>Maintaining food production standards in new trade agreements</ins> 

 In a series of inter\-disciplinary articles written with colleagues from Law, Crowley made the academic case for greater flexibility over the use of domestic policy \[ **R3**\] and trade remedies \[ **R4**\] within the WTO system. In assessing the WTO Appellate Body’s decision in a recent WTO trade dispute on animal welfare standards for imports, Crowley \[ **R3**\] argues that the WTO Agreements support a government’s right to impose its own production standards for animal welfare on imports. The research \[ **R3\]** shows how a country can, in a WTO\-compliant manner, limit imports through a government\-authorised verification program of animal treatment in production, and points out that tariffs cannot under WTO rules be set according to product processes and standards. Crowley demonstrates that such a verification programme can raise social welfare by addressing an information problem. Crowley \[ **R4**\] analyses the shortcomings in the WTO Agreements and argues that new rules on state intervention in markets are needed to address problems that arise when state intervention impacts global trade flows.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The decision of the UK to leave the EU in 2016 left the UK with the task of designing, negotiating, and implementing an independent trade policy, and with the opportunity to design a new National Food Strategy. This case demonstrates how Crowley’s expertise and research at Cambridge was sought out by UK officials to support building of trade policy capacity in Whitehall, and how her research impacted on the creation of a UK Trade Remedies Authority and on the National Food Strategy \(NFS\). 

 <ins>Building</ins> <ins>trade policy c</ins><ins>apacity in Whitehall</ins> 

 Since the UK had not negotiated its trade policy independently since 1973, the skills and experience available in Whitehall to do so were severely limited in 2016 when the new Department of International Trade \(DIT\) and the Department for Exiting the European Union \(DExEU\) were set up from scratch. DIT’s Annual Reports repeatedly outlined risks around the ability to build capacity to deliver an independent trade policy. 

 From early 2017, Crowley was sought out by UK officials to support building of trade policy capacity through policy workshops and technical training, one\-to\-one discussions with policymakers, and lengthy questions\-and\-answers sessions. Her empirical research on trade policy \[ **R1, R5**\] along with her research on the rules of international trade and the WTO \[ **R2, R3, R4**\] put her in a unique position to build such capacity. 

 Prior to the Trade Bill being put before Parliament in November 2017, Crowley held six policy workshops and meetings with staff from DIT, including Chief Economist Richard Price, Deputy Director of Trade Policy Analysis Jeremy Kempton, and Deputy Director of Trade Disputes and Market Access Victor Platten, a policy meeting with staff from HM Treasury, including two Deputy Directors, a strategy meeting with staff from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\), including Group Strategy Director Emily Miles and Chief Economist John Curnow, and two meetings with staff from the Bank of England. More recently, she has created bespoke seminars for government staff on critical topics. Audiences for these seminars ranged from small groups of elite policymakers such as a talk on “The Future of the World Trading System” \[discussing **R1, R2, R3, R5**\] for the UK’s Directors General for Exports \(John McMahon\) and Investment \(Mark Slaughter\) and the UK’s Trade Commissioners in June 2019; to approximately 100 Government Economic Service economists at a June 2020 session on “The Covid Trade Collapse” \[discussing **R1**\]; to a retreat for dozens of Foreign & Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) economists and law specialists in July 2020 on “Trade Agreements with Third Countries” \[discussing **R2**\]. 

 In 2019, Crowley was awarded a Senior Fellowship by the ESRC that built on the success of her capacity building activities with policymakers. It included provision for at least four policy workshops and two policy seminars for DIT and other government departments \(June 2019 to May 2022\). The value of these capacity building activities was strongly endorsed by the Chief Economist at DIT, and the Director of International Agreements and Trade at DExEU was keen to “ *emphasize that the knowledge imparted would be of great use to DExEU staff in developing their trade capacity*.” \[ **S1**\]. 

 <ins>The social value of</ins> <ins>t</ins><ins>rade</ins> <ins>r</ins><ins>emedies</ins> 

 A crucial question for the UK’s post\-Brexit trade policy is whether to adopt a system of trade remedies and if so, in which form. Crowley’s research \[ **R1**\] demonstrates that although trade remedies restrict trade, they are beneficial because they enable a country to react to shocks within the confines of an overall liberal trade regime. The Chief Economist at DIT stated that Crowley’s *“research\-based assessments came at a crucial time in the development of UK trade policy post\-Brexit and her contribution has been significant.”* \[ **S2**\]. 

 In June 2017, Crowley led a policy seminar for staff at DIT on the social value of trade remedies, on the different US and EU systems for administering trade remedies, and on the options available to the UK in setting up its own system. The audience included Jeremy Kempton \(Deputy Director – Trade Policy\), Vic Platten \(Deputy Director – Trade Disputes\), and Amanda Brooks \(Director of Trade Remedies and Market Access\). This seminar emphasized the relative merits of a US\-style system in which an autonomous agency, sheltered from political pressure, administers trade remedies according to clear economic criteria \[ **R1**\]. The Chief Economist at DIT stated, *“The research presented to us by Dr Crowley during this seminar was among the inputs which helped to inform our thinking in producing the ‘Trade White Paper’ in October 2017, which outlines the importance of a trade remedies framework to underpin operating an independent trade policy as the UK leaves the EU; and the Trade Bill currently in Parliament will implement this.”* \[ **S2**\]. During an evidence session to the House of Lords Select Committee on the EU, Crowley commented on the necessity of trade remedies to which Baroness Kennedy responded: *“That was very interesting analysis and quite new evidence for us.”* \[ **S3**, p13\]. 

 The Trade Bill \(based on the Trade White Paper \[ **S4**\]\) was first put before Parliament in November 2017, and contained language calling for the creation of an independent Trade Remedies Authority \(TRA\) \[ **S5**, clauses 5 and 6\], in line with the recommendations made by Crowley at the policy seminar. In early 2019, the UK TRA was established to protect Britain from unfair trading practices post\-Brexit, initially, as a ‘shadow organization’ within DIT. 

 <ins>Maintaining food production standards in new trade agreements</ins> 

 In June 2019, as part of the National Food Strategy \[ **S6**\], DEFRA commissioned work on the UK’s food regulation system post\-Brexit and the role of international trade with aim of preserving high animal standards and protecting the environment. 

 In November 2019, Crowley was appointed to the National Food Strategy \(NFS\) Advisory Panel \[ **S6**, p5\]. In this role, she shared her research on the worldwide use of tariffs and import restrictions in the food and agricultural sectors \[ **R2**\], as well as her legal and economic analysis of an important WTO dispute over animal welfare standards \[ **R3**\]. WTO agreements generally prohibit an importing country from imposing standards related to production and process methods on imports and to use tariffs to this effect. Crowley’s research \[ **R3**\] demonstrates how an importing country can instead introduce a WHO\-compliant verification programme to ensure that imports satisfy domestic animal welfare standards. Recommendation 5 of the National Food Strategy Part One \(July 2020\) reads *: “Verification programmes … should be established, so that producers wishing to sell into the UK market can, and must, prove they meet these minimum standards.”* \[ **S6,** p10\]. 

 Crowley also recommended against setting higher tariffs on goods that violated core ethical values regarding animal treatment, as this would violate WTO rules. As the independent lead of the NFS stated: *“Dr. Crowley provided challenge to this idea, backed up by extensive research* \[ **R3**\] *. She recommended creation of a verification system enabling consumers more easily to understand whether goods had been produced to the UK's core standards. The recommendation in the final report … built directly on Dr Crowley's work.”* \[ **S7**\]. Crowley’s evidence to the House of Common’s International Trade Committee on 17 June 2020 makes a similar rebuff of the idea explaining that “ *in the practice of international trade law, we do not have tariffs set up according to process standards.*” \[ **S8**, Q74, p20\]. Crowley’s expertise in this area was recognised with an appointment to the Competitiveness Working Group of the Trade and Agriculture Commission.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Good spatial policy decisions depend upon analyses of data for appropriately defined areas. The appropriate areas for economic development policy are ‘functional economic areas’ such as labour market areas \(LMAs\). The method for defining LMAs developed by Coombes is used by the UK’s Office for National Statistics to produce official statistical boundaries. Two recent major reviews of LMA definition methods, conducted by Eurostat and the OECD, both ended by recommending the Newcastle method to member countries \(who together cover most of the global economy\). A growing number of countries had already used the Newcastle method to define appropriate LMA boundaries for official statistics and/or to help improve policy delivery in geographical contexts ranging from rural Ireland to industrial Italy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UK official statistics and regional policy since the 1960s have used LMA boundaries called TTWAs \(Travel to Work Areas\). TTWA boundaries are re\-defined after each Census so they reflect changed settlement and commuting patterns. Since 1980 Coombes has led research to update TTWAs, working with the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) and its predecessor bodies **\[GRANTS1, 2, 5\]**. This co\-production of knowledge allowed for methodological innovation, while ensuring that the defined TTWAs were robust to scrutiny in Parliament. 

 A radical methodological review **\[GRANT2\]** by the Newcastle team in 2007 devised the new and intuitive iterative procedure which was used to define the 2001\-based TTWAs **\[PUB1\]**. The fundamental innovation was to replace the long\-established approach to regionalisation, in which each LMA needs a single urban core, with a flexible method that can reflect the new mobility of the labour force **\[PUB2\]**. In this way the Newcastle method identifies as a valid LMA any substantial cluster of commuting flows, whether it is urban, rural or polycentric. 

 The Newcastle method is also innovative in having just 4 parameters that ensure that all the LMAs defined meet key requirements in terms of labour market size, and level of commuting self\-containment \(a core element of the LMA concept\). The method is an algorithm in which very many iterations of a procedure define the final set of LMAs. A further vital innovation made the process non\-hierarchical: it keeps the allocation of areas repeatedly ‘under review’ so that the final LMAs are more optimal in terms of the objectives set with the 4 parameters. A review of LMA definition methods used in several countries found that these innovations made the Newcastle method unique in giving equal weight to all types of commuting flows, thereby providing a complete and more consistent mapping of a country’s LMAs **\[PUB3\]**. 

 The next challenge was to establish that the benefits of the Newcastle method would also apply to analyses of countries with very different geographies to the UK. This cross\-national transferability of methods is a key concern for international bodies. Newcastle research for Eurostat **\[GRANT4\]** identified the variety of LMA definition methods used in European Union countries. The research then showed empirically that only the Newcastle method could define appropriate LMAs in such different countries as the UK, Sweden and Spain **\[PUB4\]**. 

 Subsequent research **\[PUB5\]** has provided a conceptual basis for identifying metrics that can show which set of LMAs provides the most appropriate mapping of a country, with these metrics validated empirically by applying them to several thousand sets of LMAs in the USA. 

 Other innovative applications of the Newcastle method include its use to define housing market areas for a government agency, which involved analysing both commuting and migration flows **\[GRANT3\]**. A further form of transferability of the method was demonstrated when the scale of interest was shifted from local areas such as LMAs up to city regions **\[PUB6\]**. Applications of the Newcastle method are increasingly diverse, highlighting the flexibility of the innovative procedure developed for the definition of the 2001\-based TTWAs.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Supporting policy design and analysis in the UK**</ins> 

 It is widely recognized that TTWAs are the ‘gold standard’ definition of the UK’s functional economic areas. Functional areas such as LMAs reflect the geography of local economies, and this makes them valued for place\-based policy because most of the impact of a policy intervention in a TTWA can be expected to occur within that boundary. TTWAs are an official statistical geography of the ONS, who plan to work with Newcastle when updating TTWAs following the 2021 Census. ONS continues to depend on TTWAs for the publication of a range of official statistics on local economic conditions. These datasets are extensively downloaded by policy\-makers and other users, who value TTWAs because they are the only areas that provide a “ *statistically consistent geography for the whole country*” **\[IMP1\]**. 

 The significance of TTWAs for place\-based policy interventions is evidenced by government guidance on making the case for public investments. HM Treasury’s Green Book sets out how to appraise policies, programmes and projects, and it specifies the use of TTWAs where local labour market analysis is needed to calculate place\-based employment effects **\[IMP2\]**. The UK Government’s Head of Geography Profession observes more generally that TTWAs “ *are an important part of the tool kit for analysts across the UK seeking to analyse differences in the UK economy between different areas …\[including\] government users wanting to use a statistical geography that provides a functional economic area*” **\[IMP3\]**. 

 <ins> **Changing international organisations’ understanding of, and policy on, defining LMAs**</ins> 

 The Newcastle method for defining LMAs, the basis of the 2001\-based TTWAs, was recently recognised as ‘best practice’ at an international scale. Until 2020 neither Eurostat nor the OECD had recommended a method of defining LMAs to their member states, who together cover most of the world’s economic activity. However economic development policy\-makers in many countries have increasingly queried the ‘default’ use of administrative areas for policy and instead recognized that adopting the use of “functional areas can enhance the analysis of policy challenges, the appropriate design of policy action, and the delivery of positive outcomes for residents” **\[IMP4** \(p.17\) **\]**. 

 In its 2020 report <ins>European harmonised Labour Market Areas: methodology on functional geographies with potential</ins>, Eurostat summarised the findings of several years’ co\-ordinated cross\-national research in numerous countries. The research involved parallel analyses in European countries with contrasting geographical conditions \(and/or commuting datasets very different to the UK’s\). The conclusion was that the Newcastle method’s 4 adjustable parameters enabled countries beyond the UK to define appropriate LMAs. Using the same method in each country enabled a “harmonised” system of sufficiently comparable LMA definitions to be produced across the continent. The Newcastle method defined LMAs whose boundaries matched the “social and economic reality at which European decisions and projects need to be targeted” **\[IMP5** \(p.8\) **\]**. 

 Also in 2020 the OECD published the report <ins>Delineating Functional Areas in All Territories</ins> that drew conclusions from research undertaken following calls from several member states. The report states that LMAs “are necessary for collecting and publishing labour market statistics in a coherent and consistent manner” **\[IMP4** \(p.15\) **\]**. The research had assessed various approaches to the definition of LMAs in order to identify one method to recommend. A crucial factor in selecting the recommended method was that it should be relevant to all areas and this militated against those well\-established approaches to LMA definitions that focus exclusively on more urbanised areas. A policy using purely urban LMA definitions will clearly leave ‘off the map’ more rural and remote areas. 

 Whereas urban\-centred functional area definitions only take account of commuting flows into larger cities from surrounding areas, with the Newcastle method every flow in every direction is considered in the analysis. The result of this more holistic approach of the Newcastle method is that its definition of LMAs covers a country completely, from metropolitan areas through to remote rural regions. These advantages over urban\-centred definitions of LMAs \(in which many relevant flows are ignored, and many areas then omitted\) are highlighted in the 2019 report by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office documenting their adoption of the Newcastle method to define their national set of LMAs **\[IMP6** \(Figure G1\) **\]** \(see below\). 



 The OECD report sees the Newcastle method as a “more comprehensive conceptualisation of functional areas” **\[IMP4** \(p.21\) **\]**. This leads to the report’s recommendation of the method, whose key attribute is consistently defining a set of LMAs that is “based on functional criteria in terms of commuting flows and \[that\] covers the entire national territory” **\[IMP4** \(p.46\) **\]**.This evaluation was based on research that applied the Newcastle method to commuting patterns in numerous European countries as well as Korea and most of North America. 

 The significance of the way a set of statistical areas is defined lies in the fact that this affects the comparability of those statistics. For example if one area \(e.g. Camden\) only includes one part of a city while another area \(e.g. Carlisle\) includes not only the city but much of its surrounding rural area, then comparisons of economic data for the two are not meaningful. National or international policy decisions depend on the analysis of statistics for genuinely comparable areas. It is this policy context that is explicitly stated as the motivation for the reports by Eurostat and the OECD which both recommend the Newcastle method of defining LMAs to their member countries. In setting out this agenda the OECD asserted that “\[a\] standardised definition of functional areas, as proposed by this report, offers great benefits to policy makers and citizens alike” **\[IMP4** \(p.10\) **\]**. 

 With the widespread definition of harmonised sets of LMAs, more meaningful cross\-national analyses at a regional scale become feasible for international organisations such as the OECD and Eurostat. The definition of comparable LMAs in many countries would also fulfil the objective set in 2019 by the United Nations to create “common geographies for the dissemination of statistics” **\[IMP7** \(p.24\) **\]**. Common geographies enable valid comparisons between areas for “decision\-making processes within and between countries” \(p.vii\) and this calls for “uniformly assigned boundaries” \(p.24\), with the United Nations explicitly citing functional areas there as a geography for which consistently defined boundaries are needed. Eurostat and the OECD recommending the Newcastle method is a key step in this direction. 

 <ins> **Earlier non\-UK uses of the Newcastle method for statistical and/or policy purposes**</ins> 

 The 2020 reports by Eurostat and the OECD were released after several member countries had already used the Newcastle method independently. The earliest demonstration of the Newcastle method’s transferability was provided in Italy when its national statistical institute Istat used it in 2015 to define the Italian LMAs that are called Sistemi Locali. In that report’s Introduction, Eurostat’s Director General argues that these definitions showed that the Newcastle method offers a “transparent, reproducible, consistent and policy\-independent bottom\-up method of \[defining\] comparable Labour Market Areas for the EU” **\[IMP8** \(p.13\) **\]**. 

 Policy uses of Sistemi Locali include the 2017 selection of areas for funding under Law 181/89, with hundreds of millions of euros per year targeted at areas hit by industrial crises **\[IMP9\]**. More recently the Sistemi Locali have also been used to analyse geographical factors in the uneven impact of the COVID19 pandemic across Italy **\[IMP10** \(section 2.1\) **\]**. 

 Other policy applications of the Newcastle method include its use where no suitable LMAs have been defined by that country’s national statistical institute. In one example, Norway’s regional policy agency commissioned research which drew on the Newcastle method in the 2019 definition of the “BA\-regioner” set of LMAs that the agency needed for policy purposes **\[IMP11\]**. Another case is the Rural Economic Development Zones \(REDZ\) policy in Ireland. The government in 2016 allocated several million euros for projects whose spatial framework is a new set of LMAs defined with the Newcastle method solely for this purpose. It is notable that this policy use of functional areas was explicitly welcomed by the government Minister: “\[o\]ne of the strengths of the REDZ initiative is that it encourages Local Authorities and other stakeholders to work across administrative boundaries in neighbouring counties” **\[IMP12\]**. 

 To date the European countries where official statistics are published for LMAs defined with a form of the Newcastle method are Denmark, France, Italy, Switzerland and the UK **\[IMP13\]**. Other countries involved in the Eurostat or the OECD analyses of the Newcastle method’s transferability are Spain, Sweden, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Canada, Estonia, Korea, Mexico, and the USA, while the method was also used for a study of cross\-border LMAs that involved Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands **\[IMP13\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken by the University of Portsmouth Forensic Innovation Centre \(FIC\) has led to the development of the first forensic evidence recovery technique for pangolin scales. Poaching of pangolins for their scales has resulted in them being at risk of extinction, and they are thought to be the most trafficked mammal in the world. The FIC’s fingerprint recovery process builds on extensive research and practice expertise in forensic investigation and countering wildlife crime. This pioneering technique enables the capture of multiple evidence types \(fingerprints, DNA, pollen traces\) from one lift off the target surface using gelatine lifters. Wildlife crime rangers can process scenes quickly and effectively, enhancing efforts to disrupt this illegal trade. The methods are now distributed worldwide through partner agencies, including the Zoological Society London \(ZSL\), Border Force UK, Interpol and the Wildlife Conservation Society \(WCS\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The extensive expertise of our researchers in forensic science, criminal investigation and wildlife crime was the basis for the development of the FIC with Hampshire Constabulary in 2009, supporting collaborative and applied research in forensic and investigative science. A notable focus of this research has been on the development and enhancement of new techniques to capture evidence at crime scenes, as for example with new methods to profile DNA from marks left by gloved hands \(R1\). A key dimension of this work has been to optimise the use of the emergent technology of gelatine\-based lifting of evidential traces, which as a consequence has become an integral part of police operational investigative practice. 

 Central to the success of the FIC’s approach has been the marriage of technical advances with enhanced understanding of the limitations and opportunities of their practical application. The researchers have worked ethnographically with frontline users of forensic technologies, notably to devise means to embed mobile technology into crime scene investigative practice \(R2\), and to measure the impact of team skills, interactions, and communication of shared narratives on practice in investigations \(R3\). FIC researchers have over 15 years’ experience of going where the work takes place, engaging with the frontline users, understanding their systems and designing methods that work in context and are operationally and culturally acceptable. 

 This long\-term record of impactful research outputs, combined with extensive experience of research into wildlife crime at a national and international level \(R4 and R5\), formed the basis for a partnership with the Zoological Society of London \(ZSL\) in 2017, with the aim of developing forensic recovery methods and associated training workshops for wildlife crime rangers in wildlife parks across the world. 

 A key objective of the collaboration was to tackle pangolin poaching. The 8 species of pangolins – mammals covered in hard keratinous tissue in the form of overlapping scales – are all on the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) “Red List” of threatened species. Previous studies have estimated that between 2011 and 2013, for example, up to 234,000 pangolins were slaughtered, with only some 10% of this illegal traffic being intercepted. The meat is considered a delicacy in some countries, and pangolin scales are in demand alongside other wildlife products for the illegal use of contraband in traditional Chinese medicine. The trafficking of pangolins for their meat has recently been linked to a possible means by which the Covid\-19 virus mutated to infect humans, highlighting the environmental pressure on these species and the need to improve the investigative response. 

 Prior to the current project, there was no method of recovering fingerprints or other forensic evidence from pangolin scales. Unless someone was caught red\-handed there was no way to associate individuals to seized scales; this lack of investigative tools meant such crimes had no repercussions, which contributed to the extent of this illegal trade. An initial collaborative research project with ZSL led to the development of a wildlife forensic investigation working group made up of the FIC, ZSL, wildlife crime enforcement officers in Benin, Cameroon and Kenya and, later in the project, through WCS India. 

 The first stage of research was an ethnographic study, which visited several wildlife reserves in Asia and Africa to work alongside local officers and explore the social and technical factors of their duties \(R4\). Building on prior FIC technical research, a gelatine lifting kit was developed through experimental trials. Experiments were undertaken to verify the viability of the gelatine lifting process for collecting fingermarks, DNA and trace materials from various wildlife contraband. In more standard criminal investigations gelatine lifting is limited to footwear marks and fingermark lifting, our research was the first to research its use on wildlife contraband, and the first to consider its application to traces such as cellular DNA, pollen and environmental traces. 

 The experimental research trials determined the viability of gelatine lifters for full evidence recovery, with gelatine lifts on pangolin scales being particularly productive. The gelatine lifters visualised a mark or ridge detail on 98% of the samples in the first trials \(R6\). In 59% of these there was full ridge detail, which would support a conventional “fingerprint” identification, and in the remaining tests there was sufficient indication to identify a touch on the surface, providing a target for DNA or trace evidence recovery. This research thus successfully demonstrates that these techniques can achieve the same likelihood of successful evidence\-collection, working with wildlife materials in the field, as those addressing conventional non\-porous surfaces in a more normal scene\-of\-crime investigation. 

 The technique offers a quick, easy and deployable method which is as effective as using chemical reagents and high\-specification light sources, but can be made available in an inexpensive package and distributed to all wildlife crime enforcement organisations worldwide. Both the ethnographic and technical dimensions of the research findings were then taken forward into practical collaboration on frontline implementation.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 There are 194 member states working collaboratively with Interpol to tackle wildlife crime. Globally there are some 20,000 identified wildlife crime enforcement officers, but spread across several continents this number breaks down into relative handfuls. In India, the Wildlife Control Bureau \(WCB\) employs 109 staff, working collaboratively with a range of local organisations. FIC were able to supply one kit for every two WCB officers, covering every region in India. Similarly in Benin, 20 gelatine lifting kits have been provided, 1 for approximately every 4 officers, equipping all local and regional offices in the country. 

 The outcome of the FIC’s twin\-track collaborative ethnographic and technical approach has been the production of a kit that is easy to use, portable and inexpensive, making on\-scene evidence recovery simple and rapid. Follow up visits to end\-users consolidated the techniques and refined the kit, making it suitable to local environments, resources and capabilities. Researchers took part in several workshops with practitioners to verify the usability of the gel and to discuss a suitable strategy for deployment. In late 2018 and 2019, gelatine lifting kits were distributed to rangers in Asia and Africa through partnering agencies, principally ZSL and WCS. 

 The method targeted points of interaction using a ‘one\-lift’ system to capture available evidence and preserve it to analyse away from the scene. This evidence is used as an intelligence tool to link scenes, individuals and potentially endangered species, and where necessary, establish the provenance of impounded materials. These kits also provide a deterrent, introducing the threat of successful forensic\-evidence\-based prosecutions in jurisdictions where this has previously been unavailable. This is notably the case in India, and this deterrent threat is seen by law enforcement officers as a way of educating, reaching out and rehabilitating some members of the community who fall into trafficking\-related criminality. The scale of the wildlife crime problem and the impact on local ecologies is well publicised, and the kits provide a means to equip law enforcement agencies to tackle local issues. 

 **First use in Benin** 

 After developing the gelatine lifting kit through research work, the first deployment was in Benin as part of the Proactive Law Enforcement Training Programme, a scheme initiated and run by ZSL \(S1\). As part of this operational deployment, FIC explored the kit’s fitness for purpose for use in the field in collaboration with local officers, and ran workshops to both refine the kit for improving usability, and train officers in how to use the kit in the field. In Benin the 20 provided kits are now standard issue following the officers’ investigative and forensic training. Following their training officers in Benin are using the gelatine lifters to recover evidence as part of operational process \(S5\) 

 **Work in India** 

 Following the success in Benin, ZSL recommended its extension to their ongoing work in India, allied with WCS. The FIC ran workshops here, and with user feedback, we developed mobile phone methods to capture the marks lifted on the gelatine lifters. This meant that local officers could use the kit and capture fingerprints without extensive technical equipment. FIC trained over 50 wildlife crime officers working in national parks across India. Each of these officers received a kit, and through dialogue with them, we helped them construct their own models of best practice for use of the kits in their local conditions. 

 \[Text removed for publication\], Assam, India commented \(S2\) that *“forensic techniques will have a dramatic impact on the levels of wildlife crime”*. The India workshops resulted in positive feedback from delegates \(S3\). Positive results have begun to feed through to enforcement. In the same month \(August 2019\) that WCS India reported on the FIC workshops on their blog \(S9\), officers used the kit *“to record the fingerprints of three accused, arrested in a red sanders smuggling case in* \[text removed for publication\] *”*. The officers were *“very pleased with the kit and shared that it is a much easier way to record fingerprints than the earlier rubber stamp method”* \(S4\), and the gelatine fingerprint lift was used to support the prosecution of the smugglers. 

 **Upskilling ZSL** 

 To scale up the impact generated in both Benin and India, the FIC recognised the need for upskilling others in investigative knowledge and accurate interpretation of results from the kit. FIC members trained 4 ZSL colleagues to accurately interpret kit results, and put in place an ongoing mentoring programme for them, providing long\-term support as they became trainers themselves, working with further groups of wildlife officers. ZSL wildlife crime enforcement leads deployed their newfound expertise, along with kits provided by FIC, to Cameroon and Kenya. The ZSL \[text removed for publication\] for Cameroon reported that local officers were successfully using the kits to *“visualise finger marks on scales and other items in the field”* \(S6\). 

 **Further international impacts** 

 Through the partnership with ZSL, continuing training in the use of the gelatine kits and basic forensic techniques has now been certified as a formal structure of *“Provision of intensive adapted training in the use of Forensic Gel Technology”*, endorsed by the global agency of CITES \(the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora\) \(S7\). The gelatine lifting method will be integrated in operational practice and it will be an intrinsic part of the evidence recovery processes of the wildlife crime investigators. Further, with this method and other innovations, The FIC team is joining with WCS on a joint global training programme to embed this and other techniques into operational practice. 

 In October 2020, an agreement was reached with the Wildlife Conservation Society \(WCS\) Asia division for the FIC team to deliver their training material as part of a course on leadership in wildlife crime investigations throughout Vietnam and Indonesia. This is the first phase of a further roll\-out across Asia \(S8\). \[Text removed for publication\], supported the integration of the gelatine lifters into the training programme and promoted use of the technique. He reported that it *“has provided immeasurable benefits, not only to the scientific and investigative communities globally, but also to the officers in developing and under\-resourced countries where support, guidance, advice and training in evidential retention and forensic awareness has been given.”* \[text removed for publication\] expects this to have *“far\-reaching and long term benefits, improving knowledge and capacity of law enforcement officials, and ultimately representing the move towards more effective policing and investigations to combat the illicit trade in illegal wildlife products”* \(S5\). 

 As a result of this, WCS have awarded the FIC a contract worth up to GBP200,000 in the first year, to deliver training, and develop further awareness of the techniques. This is part of an international training programme to develop investigators with leadership skills across global regions affected by high volumes of wildlife crime. With the CITES certification noted above, the impact of the work has been endorsed by industry experts worldwide. 

 **Conclusion** 

 There are now 90 kits deployed in Benin, India, Cameroon and Kenya, in the hands of trained frontline officers who can use the kits in the field, and know how to interpret the results for effective investigation and prosecution; a cadre of ZSL staff has been equipped with the skills and support to train others in the use of the kits; with plans in hand to expand the scope of operations significantly. Research undertaken at the University of Portsmouth has been instrumental to putting a radical new tool for the reduction of illegal killing of pangolins and the illegal trade of their scales on the global agenda, and with the partnership and collaboration with WCS we expect the geographical reach and impact of this innovation to increase steadily.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Marine ecological systems are responding to human pressures such as climate change, fishing, and nutrient loading leading to deterioration. Therefore, an active approach to marine management is required to conserve marine biodiversity.  Plankton are robust indicators of environmental change and can be used to support marine policies which protect human health and inform conservation efforts for fish and seabirds. McQuatters\-Gollop led the development of new plankton indicators which contributed to the first ever regional marine biodiversity assessment in Europe. Her research influenced UK Fisheries policy and the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive \(MSFD\) and resulted in policy changes across Europe through OSPAR. These indicators now inform the regional implementation of management measures for the achievement of Good Environmental Status in the North East Atlantic 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

  

 The development of scientifically robust indicators that can track changes in pelagic habitats is a critical but novel field, which is evolving quickly to fill the needs of UK and EU policymakers. Pelagic habitats are found in the ocean water column and cover 90% of the world’s seas. Plankton, microscopic algae and animals, are ubiquitous throughout pelagic habitats and their close links to their environment and high diversity mean that they can be used as robust indicators of environmental change. The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive \(MSFD\) is the first large\-scale mechanism to holistically manage marine biodiversity through the setting of biodiversity indicators and legally required plankton indicators to track progress towards Good Environmental Status \(GES\). However, the type of indicators which should be used was undefined and unconnected to policy goals and therefore unfit for purpose. In addition, no description of GES existed for plankton. 

  

 In response to this, McQuatters\-Gollop developed three plankton biodiversity indicators revealing important information about changes in plankton species composition, functioning, and production linked to wider changes in pelagic habitats \[3.1 & 3.2\]. Though critical for marine management and policy, biodiversity indicators are only useful if they are both scientifically robust and fulfil policy objectives. These three plankton indicators were therefore co\-developed between scientists and policy makers at the UK \(Defra\) and OSPAR \(the mechanism by which 15 Governments & the EU cooperate to protect the marine environment of the North\-East Atlantic\) levels. This was the first time that the pelagic plankton community had been assessed at North\-East Atlantic and UK\-wide scales, and the assessments formed the foundation of both the UK’s 2020 Marine Strategy Assessment and the 2017 OSPAR Intermediate Assessment for pelagic habitat biodiversity and food webs. 

 Such assessments depend on setting biodiversity targets. This is not straightforward, however, as often the links between direct human disturbances and plankton responses may not be clear due to environmental and climate change. In order to resolve this challenge, a clear articulation of GES for pelagic habitats was developed by McQuatters\-Gollop and is now in use in UK and OSPAR MSFD assessments, providing the foundation for environmental target setting for the implementations of the MSFD and the UK Marine Strategy \[3.3\]. 

  

 In addition to the operational role of pelagic indicators, McQuatters\-Gollop showed that plankton indicators can also serve a surveillance role where information on plankton change can provide evidence critical for understanding variations higher up in the food web \(higher trophic levels\) e.g. fish, seabirds, or seabed habitats \[3.4\]. Subsequently, McQuatters\-Gollop investigated links between multiple trophic levels in the North Sea and demonstrated that change in plankton communities resonates upward through the food web, causing alterations to fish populations \[3.5\]. From a policy perspective, understanding of the role of plankton as surveillance indicators and the manifestation of links to higher trophic levels are required evidence to determine if UK and EU waters are in GES. The knowledge of these links addressed the key policy challenge of separating the drivers of change in higher trophic levels \(birds, non\-commercial fish\) in MSFD assessments, underpinning the assessment of food webs in the UK and OSPAR areas. This evidence \[3.1\-3.5\] provided information to policy makers about if and where to enact management measures such as sewage treatment and changes to farming practices. The results also showed that climate change is driving the changes in plankton indicators \[3.6\]. This analysis was reported in the OSPAR Intermediate Assessment 2017 and the UK Marine Strategy assessment in 2020.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 At the base of the marine food web and closely linked to their immediate environment, plankton are increasingly needed as indicators to support marine policy, inform conservation efforts for higher trophic organisms such as fish and seabirds, and protect human health. McQuatters\-Gollop’s research has informed national and international policy through the novel use of plankton indicators to provide evidence for policy decision making. Europe, including the UK, has and continues to implement ecosystem\-based management \(EBM\) of its seas. McQuatters\-Gollop’s research has resulted in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive \(MSFD\) being instrumental in delivering EBM and requiring European marine habitats and species to achieve Good Environmental Status \(GES\) for their biodiversity and food webs, which will protect the resource base upon which marine\-related economic and social activities depend. 

  

  

 **Influencing policy to achieve GES** 

 McQuatters\-Gollop’s research has aided the articulation of a policy vision of GES under the MSFD for pelagic habitats, which is the foundation of the environmental target development for pelagic habitats. This novel work has led to the development and policy uptake of pelagic habitat biodiversity indicators in close collaboration with Defra \(UK\) and the OSPAR Commission. 

  

 Plankton monitoring is essential for collecting data which highlights environmental change. As plankton communities change due to climate change or other direct anthropogenic pressures, composition of other marine food web components such as seabirds or commercial fish can be affected. McQuatters\-Gollop’s three new plankton biodiversity indicators identified statistically significant changes in plankton communities throughout UK and North East \(NE\) Atlantic. The operationalisation of these environmental indicators and targets was critical to enable monitoring of changes in marine biodiversity. McQuatters\-Gollop’s development of these innovative biodiversity indicators and targets in close collaboration with international policy makers \(13 EU Member States, Iceland, and Norway\) through OSPAR’s Pelagic Habitats Expert Group \(chaired by McQuatters\-Gollop since 2011\) expediated this \[5.1\]. These indicators now inform the regional implementation of management measures for the achievement of GES in the North East Atlantic \[5.3\]. This has led to the knowledge that plankton are experiencing profound region\-wide changes in abundance and distribution suggesting alterations to the marine food web. Many of these changes have been linked to increasing sea surface temperature changes \- a key manifestation of climate change. Emily Corcoran, Deputy Secretary, OSPAR Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North\-East Atlantic stated that McQuatters\-Gollop’s *‘contribution to this process \[was\] valuable for achieving regional coherence in the implementation of the Directive through the provision of advice to OSPAR.’* \[5.2\] 

  

  

 **Assessing pelagic habitats against environmental targets for GES** 

 McQuatters\-Gollop developed and led the first ever assessment of the status of the UK and OSPAR’s pelagic habitats against environmental targets representing GES \[5.4\]. She chaired and represented the UK in the pelagic group of OSPAR COBAM and at the national \(UK\) level chairing \(for Defra\) the pelagic expert group in the Healthy and Biologically Diverse Seas Evidence Group \(HBDSEG\), which facilitated the delivery of eco\-system based assessments and management of the UK’s marine environment. In late 2019, McQuatters\-Gollop’s leadership on HBDSEG enabled the draft assessments to go out for public consultation in the UK \[5.5\]. This was pivotal in the development of marine conservation policy and ensured that the UK had the added benefit of a consistent approach across these two groups in the development and implementation of indicators and targets for pelagic habitats under the MSFD at both UK and EU levels. McQuatters\-Gollop’s understanding, interpretation and ongoing contributions within the OSPAR MSFD processes allowed the UK to take a leading international role in the MSFD and enabled the development of scientifically robust targets which have enabled the first ever assessment of pelagic biodiversity for UK and NE Atlantic \(OSPAR\) waters. Dominic Pattison, Defra stated that, *‘Your advice has allowed us to progress development of robust indicators and targets which stand up to scrutiny and challenge and beyond this for use in consideration against wider UK marine policies’* \[5.6\]. 

 **An ecosystem approach and UK Fisheries Policy** 

 McQuatters\-Gollop’s research directly influenced recommendations on post\-Brexit marine management. She was an advisor to MPs and Ministers on sustainability and on fisheries policy and facilitated the uptake of the ecosystem approach by contributing scientific expertise to the UK Fisheries Management POSTnote \[5.7\]. She also provided evidence in Parliament as an expert witness for the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee Sustainable Seas Inquiry \[5.8\] and the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs Committee Fisheries Bill Inquiry \[5.9\].  The evidence in Parliament was considered when refining the sustainability aspects of the fisheries bill \(now the UK Fisheries Act 2020\). Underpinning everything in the Act is a commitment to sustainability, ensuring healthy seas for future generations of fishermen. Dr Charlotte Marshall, Defra said ‘ *McQuatters\-Gollop’s research has made a significant contribution to the development of marine conservation policy in the UK.’* \[5.10\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Surrey's spatial audio research has generated substantial economic, societal and cultural impacts via three main knowledge\-transfer activities: \(1\) commercialisation of sound zone technology, \(2\) public engagement with spatial audio experiences, \(3\) next\-generation audio technology for UK and global audiences. Surrey’s sound zone technology was patented and commercialised by Bang & Olufsen \(B&O\), featuring in their BeoLab and BeoSound Balance products. The pioneering object\-based audio research at Surrey has resulted in next\-generation technology and vital new capabilities for audio production, which have engaged audiences of many thousands worldwide. As a direct result of Surrey’s collaboration, the BBC have new spatial audio tools and European Broadcasting Union \(EBU\) standards for next\-generation audio and are embedding this technology into UK\-based media production infrastructure for global distribution. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Spatial audio technology offers completely enveloping sound from all around the listener, as in real life, creating a far more immersive experience than conventional audio. It is the natural and necessary complement to high\-resolution video. Sound zones deliver this without headphones by cancelling crosstalk, enabling users to experience personalised content in the same room. 

 The University of Surrey’s Centre for Vision, Speech & Signal Processing \(CVSSP\), led by Hilton since 2012, is globally\-recognised for its strengths in acoustical and visual signal processing. Complementing these strengths is Surrey’s Institute of Sound Recording \(IoSR\), with particular expertise in auditory perception. 

 Working collaboratively within two research projects on multi\-channel acoustical systems: Perceptually Optimised Sound Zones \(POSZ\) and Future Object\-Based Spatial Audio \(S3A\), CVSSP developed sound zone technology **\[R1, R2\]**, audio device orchestration **\[R3\]** and object\-based audio systems **\[R4, R5, R6\]**. 

 **Sound zone technology** 

 Sound zone systems aim to control the sound such that multiple listeners can enjoy different audio programmes within the same room with minimal acoustic interference. 

 The POSZ project \(2010\-14\) was conceived by Jackson to combine sound zone engineering with psychoacoustics to predict and evaluate perceived sound quality. CVSSP conducted engineering research collaboratively with B&O engineers, whilst IoSR performed psychoacoustic research with B&O psychoacousticians resulting in 24 publications, 4 these, 3 patents and 2 datasets. This project established scientific foundations for the practical realisation of sound zones including the suitability of energy focusing, energy cancellation, and synthesis approaches for sound zone reproduction **\[R1\]**. Regularisation was also shown to control effects on the array effort and achieved acoustic contrast between zones alongside the trade\-off between acoustic contrast and fidelity of the target audio programme in the zone **\[R2\]**. 

  

 **Audio device orchestration and object\-based audio systems** 

 The S3A project \(2013\-19 EP/L000539/1\) brought leading international experts in 3D audio and visual processing \(including The University of Salford and University of Southampton\) together with the BBC and UK creative industry. This Surrey\-led, EPSRC funded five\-year programme aimed to enable listeners at home to experience the sense of ""being there"" at live events \(e.g., concerts, football matches\) through immersive sound. The project has resulted in a large body of work including 8 datasets and over 170 publications, seminal outcomes include: 

1.  Inventing 'audio orchestration' \(AO\); using ad\-hoc consumer media devices delivering object\-based spatial audio to enhance immersion **\[R3\]**. In contrast to traditionally\-conceived spatial audio, this system relied on semantic metadata describing the audio objects and a rule set for automatically adapting the reproduction across the loudspeakers on all connected devices. Listener feedback showed a positive experience due to the increased immersion compared with stereo reproduction, and that the orchestration approach worked particularly well for drama content. 

1.  An object\-based approach for capturing, parameterising, editing, and rendering reverberation over a 3D spatial audio system **\[R4\]**. A Reverberant Spatial Audio Object \(RSAO\) embellishes a recorded sound object by synthesizing the desired room impression. In listener tests, RSAO was shown to convey room size and source distance correctly and modulate listener perception of these. 

1.  An end\-to\-end object\-based spatial audio pipeline \- from sound recording to listening **\[R5\]**. The high\-level system architecture introduced audio\-visual interfaces to support object\-based capture and listener\-tracked rendering, and proposed objectification components, recording content directly into objects. Through experimentation, the research team demonstrated that the system's novel components extended scope and capabilities beyond state of the art. 

1.  Finally, a system architecture for semantically informed rendering \(SIR\) that combines object\-based audio rendering with high\-level processing of object metadata **\[R6\]**. This processing uses novel, advanced metadata describing the objects to adjust the audio scene to the reproduction system and listener preferences. Examples demonstrated that SIR can significantly improve the media experience and provide advanced personalisation controls, for example, by maintaining smooth object trajectories on systems with few loudspeakers or providing personalised envelopment levels. 

 These outcomes from the POSZ and S3A projects represent the origin of an expansive research portfolio that culminated in the impact described.

 **The commercialisation of sound zone technology** 

 Bang & Olufsen \(B&O\) are world\-renowned for their high\-end luxury audio products; their innovative and progressive products are sold worldwide. B&O employ over 1,000 people and operate in more than 70 markets. Surrey’s sound zone technology research **\[R1, R2\]** resulted in a number of new B&O products and commercial success, B&O’s Research Director confirms: 

 “The fundamental knowledge developed in POSZ has made us capable of developing and using advanced directivity control where BeoLab 90 was the first product utilising this. Then followed BeoLab 50. BeoSound Balance and two new products will be released shortly *.”* **\[S1\]** 

 BeoLab 90 launched in November 2015, retailing at £61,000, and is described in the B&O 2015/2016 Annual report as their “< *…>* new flagship loudspeaker offering unprecedented level of control of acoustic behaviour and performance, making BeoLab 90 one of the most innovative speakers on the market”. **\[S2\]** The technologies and know\-how gained from the development of BeoLab 90 have been applied to subsequent Bang & Olufsen loudspeaker products. 

 B&O’s Annual Report 2015/16 also confirmed the commercial success of BeoLab 90: 

 “Revenue from the Speaker category increased 26 per cent compared to last year. Thereby, the share of revenue from the Speaker category was unchanged at 18 per cent compared to last year. Speaker sales were positively impacted by the launch of Bang & Olufsen’s new flagship speaker, BeoLab 90 which has been very well received in the market *.*” **\[S2\]** 

 As a result of their research collaboration \(2014\-2016\) with Surrey, B&O filed several patents relating to sound zone technology, each naming Surrey researchers as inventors **\[S3\]**. In May 2015, HARMAN International Industries \(which later became a subsidiary of Samsung\) announced its acquisition of Bang & Olufsen Automotive, B&O's car audio business unit. The sound zone patents **\[S3\]** were licensed as part of Harman’s €145M purchase of B&O’s automotive business \(2015\) **\[S1\]**. 

 HARMAN subsequently launched 'individual sound zones' \(ISZ\). In 2016, HARMAN was recognised by  [Fast Company](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com&esheet=51280461&newsitemid=20160216006480&lan=en-US&anchor=Fast+Company&index=2&md5=0fd305e5f36e6eaba523bd60f2640fac) as one of the  [Top Ten Most Innovative Companies in Automotive](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2Fcompany%2Fharman&esheet=51280461&newsitemid=20160216006480&lan=en-US&anchor=Top+Ten+Most+Innovative+Companies+in+Automotive&index=3&md5=f6aadceba2b7f0f0eca8fe1e8cc1fca1) and reported sales of $6.5B \(2015\) and $6.91B \(2016\) **\[S4\]**. Automotive backlog of awarded business also hit a record high of $24.1B in 2016 following the launch of their innovative audio systems, including ISZ **\[S5\]**. 

 **Public engagement with spatial audio** 

 Showcasing the potential of, and engaging audiences in, next\-generation audio is a critical step in the BBC and other providers investing in new tools and ultimately content. As such, the S3A project provided the BBC with such an opportunity: 

 “Three distinct pieces were produced to test out concepts relating to different strands of the research. All three of these productions were made possible through the cooperation and collaboration of the S3A project partners, the Universities of Surrey, Salford and Southampton, with BBC R&D.” **\[S6\]** 

 **The Turning Forest is the BBC’s first publicly released VR experience built on spatial audio content designed, commissioned, recorded and produced with S3A and its object\-based production system to render sounds from any direction **\[R5, S7\].** It premiered at Tribeca Film Festival \(attendance c150,000\), then at festivals in England, Scotland, France, Germany, USA, Canada and Australia, plus many community, industry and scientific events. It won the TVB Europe Award for Best Achievement in Sound \(2016\) **\[S8\]** and a nomination for Best VR Experience at the Google Play Awards \(2017\). 

 The BBC publicised The Turning Forest via their Taster website. Its YouTube trailer has >24,000 views, and overall audience reach c100k since distributed globally on Google Play \(58.5k downloads to Sept 2020\) and for Oculus Go and Samsung VR \(24.1k downloads to Feb 2020\). 

 **The Vostok\-K Incident** \(2018\) was commissioned and produced by S3A using ground\-breaking research in audio orchestration **\[R3\]** of spatial sound across multiple consumer devices to create an immersive experience. **\[S9\]** 

 Vostok\-K was launched on BBC Taster, where it received >5.9k unique views, with 72% of viewers saying they “would use the technology again” and scoring it 4/5 overall **\[S6\]**. The launch was widely covered in the media, including the Daily Telegraph, Financial Times *,* BBC Radio South, BBC Radio Surrey and BBC Click. The BBC has subsequently formed a team to develop the Audio Orchestrator technology resulting in multiple productions, including BBC Philharmonic 2020 \( [www.bbc.co.uk/taster/pilots/pick\-a\-part](https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/pilots/pick-a-part)\), Monster 2020 \( [www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2020\-10\-audio\-drama\-monster\-interactive\-sound](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2020-10-audio-drama-monster-interactive-sound)\), and public release of the Audio Orchestrator as a community tool for sound engineers  \( [https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper375](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper375)\), resulting in >300 requests to use the tool. Audience response research consistently indicates >70% of users say they would like to use this technology again. 

 In 2019, the BBC and S3A co\-produced an episode of Casualty to evaluate S3A’s research on the use of object\-based narrative importance to improve speech accessibility for broadcast integrated within a version of iPlayer \(>8k views on BBC Taster and positive audience feedback\). 

 Together, these trials were pivotal in informing the BBC’s future strategy, and as a result of their success, the BBC established its Virtual Reality Hub, producing 14 VR experiences over two years **\[S6\]**. The BBC Lead R&D Engineer confirms, “The S3A project has had a major influence on BBC R&D’s work on object\-based media in recent years, demonstrating the technical capabilities and audience value clearly. These ideas have fed into our thinking on projects such as the StoryKit and our plans for the New BBC Ecosystem.” **\[S6\]** 

 **Next\-generation audio technology** 

 Since stereo's first broadcast 59 years ago, the systems and infrastructure have evolved worldwide to support channel\-based audio. Next\-generation audio \(NGA\) reflects a major global transformation in broadcast and internet\-delivered media services for improved listening experiences, using object\-based techniques to make audio more immersive and personalisable. The BBC’s Lead R&D Engineer confirms Surrey’s critical role \(via S3A\) in enabling next\-generation audio: 

 “The BBC’s role has been in creating interoperable standards for NGA production and distribution. The S3A research work contributed directly to the BBC’s work on the Rec. ITU\-R BS.2127 standard that specifies algorithms for rendering the Audio Definition Model. This has recently been implemented in the EAR Production Suite \( [https://ear\-productionsuite.ebu.io/](https://ear-productionsuite.ebu.io/)\), a project by the European Broadcasting Union.” **\[S6\]** 

 The BBC and EBU have also adopted S3A object\-based audio datasets as reference material for the NGA standards, including the Audio Definition Model Renderer and the Binaural NGA Renderer. This underpinned a binaural production of Doctor Who in 2017.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by the Griffiths\-Wang group at Swansea University has changed the way in which many sterols, including steroids and other cholesterol\-like molecules, can be analysed. Owing to the nature of their structure, the diversity of occurrence in nature and the tendency of cholesterol to dominate in abundance, analysis of sterols has historically proved challenging. The Griffiths\-Wang group have overcome these challenges by developing a novel “enzyme\-assisted derivatisation for sterol analysis” \(EADSA\) technology, opening up new approaches to patient management for health care professionals worldwide. The monitoring of sterol metabolites has proven invaluable for disease diagnosis and prognosis and in monitoring the response to therapy for patients with rare inborn errors of metabolism, including lysosomal acid lipase deficiency \(LALD\), cholesterol 25\-hydroxylase \(CH25H\) deficiency, spastic paraplegia type 5 \(SPG5\), Smith\-Lemli\-Opitz syndrome \(SLOS\) and acyl\-CoA oxidase 2 \(ACOX2\) deficiency. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Inborn errors of metabolism \(IEM\) provoke a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, from mild to lethal forms, and are mostly incurable but very often treatable. Although detection and diagnosis are key, the biochemical profile is needed for effective patient management. Since 2007, Swansea University’s Griffiths\-Wang group has investigated the biochemistry of cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism and how it is implicated in disease. Cholesterol metabolites, including hormonal steroids and bile acids, have been analysed by mass spectrometry \(MS\) for several decades. One class of cholesterol metabolite called oxysterols is of particular clinical and pharmaceutical interest, as they can act as ligands to, or modulators of, nuclear receptors, G protein\-coupled receptors \(GPCRs\) and *N*\-methyl\-D\-aspartate receptors \(NMDARs\), and their abundances in body fluids can reflect underlying biochemical errors and ultimately disease. Oxysterols are difficult molecules to characterise as they are ‘invisible’ to most methodologies due to the absence of a strong chromophore or easily ionised functional group. 

 In 2008 the Griffiths\-Wang group was the first to describe a method to investigate the oxysterol content of human plasma using high\-performance liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry \(HPLC−MS\) that incorporated “enzyme\-assisted derivatisation” and high\-resolution MS. The methodology was shown to be straightforward, specific, highly sensitive and could be performed on an “omic” format **\(R1\).** The methodology opened a previously closed “window” into the combined metabolomic analysis of sterols, oxysterols, and steroid hormones. The technology was patented and formed the basis of the Swansea University spinout company Cholestenix Ltd \(incorporated in November 2013\), with a mission to deliver new innovative treatments and biomarkers for devastating neurodegenerative diseases. Using this method, Griffiths & Wang discovered novel ligands to nuclear receptors and to the Class F GPCR Smoothened **\(R6, R7\).** 

 In 2008, Griffiths, Wang and colleagues published a proof\-of\-concept study in a clinical setting that demonstrated the use of “enzyme\-assisted derivatisation for sterol analysis” \(EADSA\) to detect inborn errors of metabolism. The method was used effectively in the 100% correct diagnosis of Smith\-Lemli\-Opitz syndrome using amniotic fluid. SLOS is a rare autosomal recessive disease where severe cases present with profound intellectual disability and major physical abnormalities **\(R2\).** 

 In 2013\-14, the efficacy of the technology in diagnosing disease in a clinical setting was further proven when EADSA was used to analyse the plasma of a young patient who presented with jaundice. The data confirmed the patient to be suffering from oxysterol 7α\-hydroxylase deficiency, a very rare autosomal recessive disease which presents with liver disease in infants, and which can lead to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 \(SPG5\), a type of motor neuron disease, in adults. The technology was crucially used to monitor the response to therapy and subsequently demonstrated the improved biochemical phenotype of the patient when successfully treated with chenodeoxycholic acid \(CDCA\) **\(R3\).** 

 The group developed the technology further with the introduction of isotope\-coded derivatisation reagents, allowing the multiplexed analysis of samples with the detection of sterols, including steroids and bile acids with either a hydroxy or ketone function by HPLC\-MS, a key aspect of the Swansea technology. The ultimate method allows the quantitative measurement of the widest range of cholesterol precursors and metabolites, in terms of exact molecular structures, in a single analysis \( **R4, R5**\). The EADSA method was exploited to identify novel oxysterols in plasma from patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis \(CTX, a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disease leading to progressive spastic\-ataxic gait disorder and cognitive decline due to abnormal bile acid and cholesterol metabolism\), SPG5 and SLOS **\(R4, R7\)**, and then to identify unusual intermediate metabolites in patients diagnosed with a number of different lysosomal storage disorders, to define the biochemical phenotypes of those disorders **\(R5\).** 

 The derivatization technology described in these papers was patented by Swansea University and licensed to global chemical suppliers \(Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. and Cayman Chemical Company\). 

 Furthermore, SU\-led research on motor neuron disorders \(including SPG5, CTX and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\) using cerebrospinal fluid \(CSF\) and plasma from patients showed that specific cholesterol\-derived acids selectively regulate the balance between survival and death of motor neurons, revealing therapeutic potential towards this devastating group of diseases **\(R6\).**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The difference between incidence and detection of inborn errors of metabolism is dependent on the ability of the clinician to first suspect a rare disease and secondly confirm both the phenotype and genotype. For the patients and families of those suffering with rare conditions, a diagnosis means an opportunity for early treatment e.g., by CDCA in the case of CTX and oxysterol 7α\-hydroxylase deficiency, and an end to the uncertainty and lack of information around treatment measures and outcomes, opening avenues for connection with support groups. Many inborn errors of metabolism do not yet have a specific therapy, so for the clinician a confirmed phenotype allows potential treatments to be tried and tested. 

 The EADSA technology has been used to identify key sterol metabolites and bile acid precursors in patient samples. The unique technology and expertise of Griffiths and Wang, which they offered without charge, has helped to confirm biochemical phenotypes of, and improve the selection of treatments for and the management of 70 patients with a range of rare inborn errors of cholesterol metabolism across Europe, Asia and the U.S \( **Table 1**\).

 These patients can now be more confidently diagnosed and better treated, and their disease is better managed through the application of this novel patented technology. Specific examples of the impact the research has had within disease states are presented below: 

 **SPG5** 

 SPG5 is a rare condition with unknown prevalence that is caused by mutations in the *CYP7B1* gene, which controls the production of the enzyme oxysterol 7α\-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in steroid metabolism in the brain. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to a wide range of signs and symptoms, most notably neurodegeneration and movement problems. In infants, the deficiency may present with liver disease, in which case it is referred to as oxysterol 7α\-hydroxylase deficiency. 

 In 2016 Professors Griffiths and Wang *“greatly assisted in characterizing the biochemical phenotype \(sterol profile\) of a Cypriot patient with spastic paraplegia, in particular a patient with novel, bi\-allelic CYP7B1 mutations causing SPGA5A*”. This was the first Cypriot patient identified with this condition **\[C1\].** 

 In Athens, the Griffiths\-Wang laboratory was instrumental between 2016 and 2017 in the successful treatment of a 22\-year\-old patient with SPG5. The laboratory measured sterols in monthly blood and urine samples over a period of 18 months to track the patient’s response to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid \(CDCA\). The clinicians confirmed that *“the procedure performed helped considerably in the treatment of the patient and the biochemical profile in response to CDCA treatment”* **\[C2\].** 

 Between 2013 and 2014 in collaboration with clinicians at Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL Institute of Child Heath, who were treating a young patient presenting with liver disease, and suffering from oxysterol 7α\-hydroxylase deficiency, the Swansea group monitored the biochemical response to treatment with CDCA. The therapy was successful. **\[C3\].** 

 **ACOX2 Deficiency** 

 ACOX2 deficiency is an exceptionally rare disease with less than five cases reported world\-wide, it arises from mutations in the *ACOX2* gene coding a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the sidechain shortening of bile acid precursors, a necessary step in the biosynthesis of primary bile acids. ACOX2 deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder presenting to differing extents with cholestatic liver disease and neurologic dysfunction in infants and children. 

 In 2018, Griffiths and Wang used their EADSA technology to define the biochemical phenotype of Turkish patients suspected to have ACOX2 deficiency and “ *for the first time, a previously unknown syndrome caused by recessive Acyl CoA Oxidase 2 deficiency has been identified with the great help of Professor William J. Griffiths from Swansea University Medical School in UK. Prof. Griffiths and his laboratory have greatly contributed to both the diagnosis and follow\-up of the new disease by performing urine, serum and plasma bile acid analysis”* **\[C4\].** 

 **Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency \(LALD, Wolmans\) Cholesterol 25\-Hydroxylase Deficiency and Other Sterol\-Related Disorders.** 

 Caused by mutations in the *LIPA* gene, LALDs are rare inherited disorders about which little is known of the signs, symptoms, and progression. Wolmans disease is a LALD characterised by a complete absence of the *LIPA* protein. LALDs result in problems with lipid metabolism and the accumulation of harmful amounts of lipids in cells and tissues throughout the body, which subsequently causes liver disease. 

 In 2017 in collaboration with the Genomic Medicines team at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester, the first ever patients with a double deletion of *LIPA* and of the adjacent gene *CH25H*, coding the enzyme cholesterol 25\-hydroxylase, were identified using EADSA. Professors Griffiths and Wang were the first to biochemically confirm the enzyme deficiency in these children, and they have continued to “ *look in detail at their sterolomic and oxysterol profiles of the LALD* \(and double deletion\) *patients* *before and after treatment with both Enzyme Replacement Therapy and Hemopoietic Stem Cell transplantation. This is proving a critical part in assessing the benefits of treatment”* **\[C5\].** Work with the team in Manchester has extended beyond LALDs and currently includes other rare lysosomal disorders Niemann\-Pick type B and C diseases. Niemann\-Pick disease can affect the brain, nerves, liver, spleen, bone marrow and lungs. There is no cure, but treatments are being developed. People with these conditions experience progressive loss of function of nerves, the brain and other organs. Other inborn errors of cholesterol metabolism being studied include, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis \(CTX\), NSDHL deficiency and lathosterolosis. Less than five cases of lathosterolosis have been reported world\-wide, the disorder is characterised by facial dysmorphism, congenital anomalies, failure to thrive, developmental delay and liver disease, there are treatments but no cure. 

 **SLOS** 

 SLOS is a severe autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defects in a cholesterol\-synthesising enzyme that lead to a build\-up of the cholesterol precursor 7\-dehydrocholesterol in tissues and blood plasma. SLOS affects an estimated 1 in 20,000 to 60,000 newborns. Mildly affected individuals may have only minor physical abnormalities with learning and behavioural problems, but severe cases can be life\-threatening and involve profound intellectual disability and major physical abnormalities, and there is no cure. Despite this, it is important for parents to have a diagnosis for their child and for clinicians to initiate treatments. Professors Griffiths and Wang have discovered a novel bile acid biosynthesis pathway in SLOS which may be responsible for the dysmorphology observed in this disease **\[R7\]**. Regarding these discoveries, collaborators at the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health stated “ *Laboratories such as mine that can pick up unusual metabolites in children with significant disease really value the ability of Bill’s lab to identify the abnormal compound\(s\) we have detected*” **\[C6\].** 

 Our EADSA methodology has also been used to diagnose SLOS at Hong Kong Queen Mary Hospital, where the medical technologist stated, “ *I can successfully detect 7‐DHC in MS and I am so excited now*\!”, confirming that elevated 7\-DHC provides a diagnosis of SLOS **\[C7\].** 

 The definitive diagnosis and monitoring of response to therapy provide peace of mind and hope to parents of those with IEM and allow clinicians to search for ever better therapies.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The ‘Heat and the City’ project examined governance of heat decarbonisation and energy efficiency in buildings in the UK and internationally, leading to the following impact: 

1.  informing new **Scottish and UK Government heat and energy efficiency policies,** including creation of UK Government Heat Networks Delivery Unit and £320M Investment Programme; 

1.  establishing a revised statutory definition of fuel poverty in Scotland, and influencing **heat regulation** and energy planning through Scottish Government heat network legislation and proposals for new local authority statutory powers; 

1.  guiding **investment** in integrated smart local energy systems, and low carbon infrastructure, including development of UK Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund bid *Prospering from the Energy Revolution* resulting in Treasury investment of £102.5M in demonstrators. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Janette Webb and the ‘Heat and the City’ team research the governance of heat decarbonisation and energy efficiency in buildings, and development of local clean energy systems. Research encompasses five externally\-funded projects \(2010\-2020\): *Heat and the City* \(RCUK Energy Programme & Scottish Government\); *Reframing Energy Demand: Innovation for Sustainable Heat* \(EPSRC grant & ESRC Impact Acceleration Account \); *Local Engagement in UK Energy Systems* \(RCUK Energy Programme, Energy Technologies Institute & ESRC Impact Acceleration Account\); *Stratego Enhanced Heating and Cooling Plans* \(Intelligent Energy Europe & Scottish Government\) *; Evaluating Energy Efficient Scotland Pilots* \(Scottish Government ClimateXChange\) and Local and Regional Energy Systems \(UKRI/Theme 2 UK Energy Research Centre Phase 4\) *.* 

 Heat and the City gathered comparative data from UK and European financial institutions, public sector bodies, trade organisations and the third sector to inform UK\- and Scotland\-specific energy governance. From international organisations through to Glasgow households, the scale varied between projects, utilising methods combining ethnography of policy processes and business development, expert interviews, social surveys, documentary analysis and secondary analysis of public datasets. The research identified the following problems and solutions around three key areas of decarbonising heat and reducing energy demand in buildings: 

1.  The UK centralised energy system is geared towards large supply\-side businesses, marginalising local clean heat business development and limiting incentives for energy saving in buildings. The solution is to *integrate local energy* e.g. through establishment of Heat Networks Delivery Unit \(HNDU\) \(3.1, 3.2\), and develop investment models that *future\-proof* infrastructures \(3.3\). 

1.  Absence of heat network regulation in the UK leads first to uneven customer protection and pricing, further restricting sources of *affordable heating* for vulnerable consumers \(3.1, 3.4\); and second to investment risks which limit low cost capital for infrastructure. The result is ‘island’ heat network systems focused on short term financial payback, with limited carbon saving \(3.1\) In contrast, the research into regulation in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands \(3.1, 3.5\) identified: requirements on building owners to connect; consumer protection; and technical standards. The solution is *new heat network regulations* to de\-risk investment, improve technical standards, and ensure fair prices and services. The lack of investment in skills and capacities for project planning and development further constrains UK progress on heat and energy efficiency \(3.1, 3.2\). 

1.  UK local authorities and partners lack *capacities* for cross\-sector energy planning for cost and carbon efficient local integration of heat, power, transport and storage systems. The solutions are: investment in specialist expertise; and capacity building and locality scale demonstrators to increase knowledge about local energy system options, including access to data and support for business and supply chain innovation \(3.6\).

 4. Details of the impact 

 Heat and the City research has transformed UK and Scottish energy governance, across three main areas: 

-  UK and Scottish Government **policies** for energy governance, integrating local energy planning alongside the largest public investment in UK heat networks and contributing to UK Treasury guidance. 

-  Scottish Government **regulation**, by contributing first to a revised statutory definition of fuel poverty, and second to heat network regulation to de\-risk investment, increase standards and ensure fair prices. 

-  UK and Scottish Government **investment** in integrated local energy systems, particularly through capacity building, demonstrator projects and real\-time evaluation research. 

 UK Policy – Heat Policy, and Future\-Proofing infrastructure investment 

 The UK Government Department for Energy and Climate Change \(now Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\)\), after a successful bid led by BRE with the Heat and the City team as the academic partner, funded research on barriers to development of district heating networks; the report \(5.1\) integrated early findings \(3.3, 3.5\). This report’s recommendations were partially published in the UK Government Heat Strategy 2013 \(5.1\) and directly led to the decision to establish a new policy unit within UK Government in 2014. It is noted on the UK Government website that “ *Since its inception, HNDU has run 9 funding rounds – awarding £23 million in total – and is currently running Round 10. Over 250 unique projects have so far been supported across 150 local authorities""* \(5.1\). The UK Treasury used research findings \(3.3\) on future proofing infrastructure, specifically the concept of ‘passive provision’, leading to UK Treasury Supplementary Green Book guidance \(5.2\) for assessing investment in heat networks. A research case study of heat network investment \(3.3\) was included in UK Treasury Green Book supplementary advice as an exemplar for public bodies to apply \(5.2\). 

 Scottish Policy and Regulation – Fuel Poverty, Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategies and District Heating Regulation 

 The social survey research \(3.1, 3.4\) on householders in Wyndford, Glasgow, as well as comparative studies of heat as a service \(3.5\) contributed to a new definition of fuel poverty under the Fuel Poverty \(Targets, Definition and Strategy\) \(Scotland\) Act 2019. Wyndford householders lived through a major housing estate renovation and retrofit of energy efficiency and district heating. Findings formed the basis for Webb’s appointment to the Scottish Government Academic Review Panel; the Panel proposed a new definition of Fuel Poverty which Scottish Government formally accepted, and included in legislation \(5.3\). Examining dimensions of fuel poverty, findings \(3.1, 3.4\) contributed to the inclusion of principles for affordable warmth and minimum income in the new policy definition. In her letter to Professor Webb, the Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, Angela Constance, states *“Your vast experience in comparative European policy and practice for sustainable heat and energy efficiency has provided valuable input into the definition review”* \(5.4\). 

 In Scotland, proposed heat network regulation has been shaped by comparative analyses of European regulations \(3.1, 3.5\) which were part of the evidence base in Scottish Government proposals for new *Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategies \(LHEES\) and District Heating Regulations* \(5.5\). Webb and the Heat and the City team have been closely involved in policy development \(2011\-ongoing\), including through expert and technical advisory roles to Scottish Government cross\-sector Working Groups. In his letter to the 2016 Special Working Group on Regulation the Scottish Minister, Paul Wheelhouse, stated that its expertise contributed to “ *a comprehensive and insightful consultation document, which will be invaluable in informing and progressing potential legislation in this complex area”* \(5.6\). 

 The *Heat Networks \(Scotland\) Bill \(SP Bill 64\)* was introduced to Parliament on 2 March 2020. \(5.7\). The accompanying Policy Memorandum accepted the expert advice on the need for a heat supply license, and for regulation covering pricing, service and technical standards \(5.8\). Webb’s evidence relating to poor data quality on the energy performance of non\-domestic buildings was cited in the Policy Memo which refers to these “ *risks resulting in Heat Network Zones being less robust than they otherwise might be. This may increase the risk that their designation is challenged.\[…\] the Bill  will place a duty, initially, on public sector building owners to undertake an assessment of the viability of their buildings to connect to a heat network”* \(5.8 pp.11\-12\). 

 UK and Scottish Government Investment in low carbon strategies and research 

 Webb and her team’s research was a component of a body of evidence that contributed to the inclusion of low carbon principles in the decision to establish an Infrastructure Commission for Scotland. Webb was appointed to the Commission as a low carbon expert, and the new commission’s remit included low carbon investment principles for a 30\-year strategy, directly influenced by Heat and the City research \(3.1, 3.3, 3.5\): *“The Commission will provide independent, informed advice on the vision, ambition and priorities for a long\-term, 30\-year strategy for infrastructure in Scotland to meet our future economic growth and societal needs”* \(5.9\). 

 Webb was appointed Expert Adviser to UK Research and Innovation \(UKRI\) to help develop a business case to BEIS and Her Majesty’s Treasury \(HMT\) for investment in integrated local energy system demonstrators and designs, capacity building and research under the Industrial Strategy Challenge Investment fund \(ISCF\).  Webb et al’s research findings \(3.1, 3.2, 3.6\) fed into the successful bid which secured GBP102,500,000 investment from HMT into the *Prospering from the Energy Revolution* \(PFER\) challenge. Webb’s contribution was in particular on the involvement of Local Authorities as key stakeholders, and she was subsequently appointed on the Challenge Advisory Board. The Deputy Challenge Director, UKRI, said *“The most important and timely work that helped secure confidence in LA’s appetite for developing activities in local energy was research developed by ETI/UKERC \(Local Authority Engagement in UK Energy Systems; Webb, Tingey and Hawkey, 2017 \[3.2\]\) which set out which areas were engaged in the agenda to what degree, and enabled the case to be made that there were a significant number of authorities ‘running hard’ to develop local energy projects.* \(5.10\). 

 Webb has been awarded an MBE for her services to energy transition in the UK in the Queen’s Honours List \(2020\) \(5.11\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The *Diffusion of Innovation in Low Income Countries \(DILIC\)* project led by Professor Xiaolan Fu has been a major driver of a new and constructive international discourse on science, technology and innovation in developing countries. Initial field research in Ghana informed industrial policy in that country and strengthened wider African capabilities for quantitative policy research on innovation. These outcomes in turn generated a new approach to innovation at the UN: initially in the resolutions of the International Conference on Financing for Development at Addis Ababa; then in the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and specifically on Sustainable Development Goals 9 and 17;  and ultimately in the creation of the UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism supported by the new UN Technology Bank.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Until recently, indigenous industrial innovation was not seen as a priority for low\-income countries \(LICs\). Firms in LICs are necessarily highly innovative to survive, generating “under\-the\-radar” innovations that reflect the circumstances they face. However, governments in these countries are unable to consolidate and spread these indigenous innovations to generate a self\-sustaining process that would enable them to match technological advancement in northern countries. Specifically, in the case of Ghana there have been few links between universities and industry; links that have been found to be critical for innovation in industrialising economies \( **R1**\). 

 The *Diffusion of Innovation in Low Income Countries \(DILIC\)* project at Oxford was the first comprehensive evidence\-based study on innovation in LICs. It reviewed and analysed the global evidence available on the nature of innovation in LICs, origins and diffusion channels, barriers to innovation, and the role of innovation in sustainable development. Because this was the first rigorous survey of the topic, important yet unrecognised barriers to innovation were identified and potential solutions proposed for validation in the field. This comprehensive review was complemented by an in\-depth study of Ghana, known as the “Ghana Innovation Survey”, which covered over 500 Ghanaian businesses, with 23 case studies of individual firms, including informal businesses \( **R1**, **R2**\). The survey took place over two rounds, conducted in 2013 and 2015. 

 The DILIC project was funded by ESRC\-DFID and supported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \(UNCTAD\) and the Ghanaian government through the Science and Technology Policy Research Institute \(STEPRI\), which forms part of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research \(CSIR\). The research was led by Xiaolan Fu and Giacomo Zanello \(Oxford\) in collaboration with Pierre Mohnen \(Maastricht University\) and a multinational team of researchers and advisors from universities and agencies in Europe and Africa. The Ghana partner explains that: “CSIR\-STEPRI agreed to collaborate with Oxford University on the DILIC project because from the onset the project was strategically designed in a way that clearly showed its ability to achieve some extended impacts in Ghana and beyond” \[ **C1**\]. 

 The combination of the international survey and the Ghana fieldwork indicated that: 

-  contrary to received wisdom, innovation happens in both informal and formal sectors in LICs, through adoption and adaptation. However, this innovation is unsupported and not scaled up in a way that might drive structural change in LICs \( **R1**\). 

-  Firms derive knowledge from external sources, especially from customers and from participation in value chains and regional production networks \( **R3**, with Shujin Zhu of Hunan University\). 

-  Knowledge transfer from multinational enterprises \(MNEs\) and from universities to local firms in LICs is weaker than in East Asia, although transfer of knowledge from Chinese MNEs was stronger \( **R4**, with former ODID MPhil student Cyrielle Auffray\). 

-  There are marked gender differences in innovation: women are less likely to introduce technological innovations, but more likely to adopt marketing innovations \( **R5**, with CS Srinivasan of the University of Reading and Bhavani Shankar of SOAS; **R6**, with CS Srinivasan of the University of Reading\). 

-  Links between universities and industry are scarce in Ghana, even though such links are known to be crucial for innovation because universities provide skills and capacity that enable firms to move beyond learning\-based innovation \( **R1**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The *Diffusion of Innovation in Low Income Countries \(DILIC\)* research project had found that increasing technological capabilities in LICs needed to be seen by researchers and policymakers as an essential *means* of development and not just as a desirable future *outcome* of development. The original research site was Ghana, so the *first* goal was to ensure policy and institutional changes there and elsewhere in Africa. The *second* planned step was to ensure a change of view in the wider development community concerned with industry and technology in LICs – particularly the United Nations agencies: “Oxford University set the foundation for a policy\-focused project engaging policymakers and relevant stakeholders from the project’s inception. Policymakers in response accepted the project’s objectives and agreed to consider them in their work plan” \[ **C1**\]. The *third* stage – difficult to foresee initially but feasible after the second step – was to transform UN institutions themselves so as to permanently embed this new view of innovation in international development doctrine. 

 *Building government capacity for innovation in Ghana and Africa* 

 The Minister of Environment, Science and Technology in Ghana acknowledged the importance of the Ghana Innovation Survey programme \[ **R1**, **R2**\] for Ghanaian industrial strategy and implemented one of its main findings – that better links between university and industry were needed to facilitate innovation in Ghana – in a programme to strengthen university\-industry collaboration \[ **C1**\], \[ **C2**\]. Later in 2014, at a DILIC dissemination conference held in Accra, the same minister called on African governments to “take innovation seriously and work to track innovation performances in their countries” and hoped that “the research activities of the DILIC Project would be mainstream\[ed\] into national programmes after the three\-year lifespan” \[ **C3**\]. 

 The second Ghana Innovation Survey \[ **R1**, **R2**\], undertaken in 2015, asked business about their collaborations with universities in the period 2013\-14. The survey showed that collaboration with universities and research institutes had increased since 2012: 50 firms \(out of a total of 495\) were collaborating with universities, 19 more than in the previous survey. More than 60% of the collaboration was established proactively by a university, which was a significant change in comparison to the initial survey, covering the period 2010\-12, when there was no collaboration initiated by a university \[ **R1**: p110 and 114\]. 

 As the Director of CSIR\-STEPRI acknowledged, the survey work undertaken by the team “filled a knowledge gap by examining in\-depth the diffusion of innovation in Ghana” \[ **C1**\]. They also acknowledged how their staff had benefitted from data collection training: “the DILIC project enabled the Oxford University to enhance CSIR\-STEPRI’s research and project implementation capacity. Certain basic research skills were improved” \[ **C1**\]. 

 Following online training by the DILIC team, Ghanaian researchers from the CSIR\-STEPRI team went on to train researchers in Tanzania to apply the innovation survey methodology \[ **C1**\]. The DILIC findings also informed government policies in Tanzania on the provision of training and subsidies to support innovation **.** 

 As a result of this work in Africa, the World Intellectual Property Organisation \(WIPO\) approached DILIC for a methodology that was more appropriate for LICs, and used the survey instrument in Uganda: “WIPO had been approached by Uganda to do some study work on both formal and informal aspects of innovation in the agri\-food processing sector …I then asked … whether we could work together on this, and use some of \[DILIC’s\] methods in survey collection of data. … The DILIC methodology was more appropriate for LICs than previously existing innovation survey methodologies … due to its specific focus on characteristics of the informal innovator and informal innovation clusters. As a result of this collaboration, in 2016, DILIC’s survey methodology \(as first trialled in Ghana\) was adopted by WIPO in the Uganda research process on innovation in the agro\-processing sector. The data gathered in Uganda has gone on to benefit associated national innovation policy\-making and evidence on how to apply these surveys in sectoral developing country contexts. This kind of data collection has transformed our thinking/practice as to how we think about innovation in developing countries. WIPO member countries took to these findings with great interest – more of this type of work is expected to do justice to novel and different form\[s\] of informal cluster innovation” \[ **C4**\]. 

 *Changing the understanding of innovation in LICs internationally*The DILIC project findings thus transformed policymakers’ understanding of the potential for and barriers to innovation in LICs, and through UNCTAD \(the lead UN organisation in this field\) were disseminated across the developing world. According to the Director of the UNCTAD Technology Division, the project contributed to filling a “vacuum” in research on the innovation process in low\-income countries with “valuable, coherent and consistent data” \[ **C5**\]. 

 Professor Fu was invited to address the UN General Assembly meeting on “Fostering science, technology & innovation” in New York in 2014, which was a preparatory event for the third UN International Conference on Financing for Development, due to take place in Addis Ababa the following year. At this session, drawing on results from DILIC, Professor Fu provided an overview of the state of science, technology and innovation in developing countries. She noted that despite significant catching up with developed countries, progress had mostly been concentrated in middle\-income countries. Gaps between low and middle\-income developing countries were evident in the lower levels of patent applications, journal papers, and investments in research and development in the latter. 

 Grounded in her research, she noted that most of the innovations carried out in developing countries, for example in firms in Africa, were low\-cost innovations \( **R1**\), with a lack of finance as a critical constraint, particularly for larger\-scale innovations. In terms of policy actions, she suggested that both public and private financing would be needed at the national level to provide different types of finance for different stages of the technology cycle. Education, training and stronger linkages and collaboration among firms and universities were also key \[ **C6**\]. Subsequently, the Economic Affairs Officer at the Financing for Development Office, United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs \(UN DESA\), wrote that “it was very evident that your intervention was most relevant and will certainly inform the upcoming intergovernmental process in the lead up to the Addis Ababa conference” \[ **C7**\]. This recognition was then reflected in an invitation to lead a symposium at the UN Development Cooperation Forum in April 2015 in South Korea. The third UN International Conference on Financing for Development took place in Addis Ababa in July 2015. The outcome was the “Addis Ababa Action Agenda”, which included “Science, technology, innovation and capacity\-building” as one of seven “action areas” for UN Member States \[ **C8**\]. In this “action area”, the influence of the DILIC project can be seen clearly, for example: “We will encourage knowledge\-sharing and the promotion of cooperation and partnerships between stakeholders, including between Governments, firms, academia” \( **R2**\) \[ **C8**\]. 

 The Addis Ababa Action Agenda fed into the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was agreed at the UN Summit on Sustainable Development in New York in September 2015. Both UNCTAD \(which had been a partner in DILIC\) and UNIDO had already been pushing for innovation to be given a higher priority in the SDGs. Professor Fu’s involvement in the preparatory meetings before the New York summit meant that DILIC findings and recommendations contributed significantly to the formulation of SDG9 \(“Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation”\) and SDG17 \(“global cooperation in a cumulative and collaborative way”\). 

 Specifically, a Senior Economic Affairs Officer from the Division for Sustainable Development Goals states that, “Paragraph 70 of General Assembly resolution A/RES/70/1 \(‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’\) … is unusually detailed and considered most of the principles and recommendations arising from Prof. Xiaolan Fu’s DILIC project work \[and\] followed a fully multi\-stakeholder format which constituted an entirely new working model for the UN. It goes without saying that General Assembly resolutions do not typically cite particular research projects, but the intellectual source can be traced directly to Prof. Xiaolan Fu’s research and engagement” \[ **C9**\]. 

 *Helping to develop UN mechanisms to support innovation* 

 The Addis Ababa Action Agenda also called for the establishment of a Technology Facilitation Mechanism \(TFM\) in order to support the implementation of the SDGs. The TFM facilitates multi\-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships through the sharing of information, experiences, best practices and policy advice among Member States, civil society, the private sector, the scientific community, United Nations entities and other stakeholders. Professor Fu was appointed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki\-Moon to the ten\-person advisory team of the TFM \[ **C10**\] in 2015 and DILIC’s local partner in Ghana, Dr George Essegbey, in 2016. A key task of the TFM was to create an online platform for technology facilitation for innovators, policymakers and entrepreneurs from developing countries and in 2016, Professor Fu was elected leader of the online platform’s independent review working group. The resulting platform, 2030 Connect, was launched in July 2020 by the UN’s ICT Office \[ **C11**\]. 

 In recognition of the importance of the Oxford research, Professor Fu was also appointed by the UN Secretary\-General  to the Governing Council of a new UN Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries \(LDCs\) in 2017. The new UN bank aims to implement the TFM by supporting technology access, acquisition and utilisation in LDCs and promoting research networking among their science, technology and innovation communities. The bank \(hosted by Turkey\) started work in 2018 with the statutory aim of achieving SDG Target 17.8 \(“Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation capacity\-building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology”\). 

 Overall, the significance of the contribution made by the DILIC project is well summed up by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs official: “Prof. Xiaolan Fu’s engagement and research project’s findings have greatly contributed to the emergence of a completely new and constructive discourse on science, technology and innovation at UN headquarters that has ultimately triggered policy and institutional change” \[ **C9**\].

 Beyond specialist research, ancient ghost folklore is not well known outside the academy. However, more modern ghost folklore remains extremely popular as a subject for study and entertainment, bringing substantial benefits to contemporary economy and culture through books, television series and films. In the Western world, better known more recent ghost stories have often been produced within a broadly Christian culture. Public engagement activities on ancient ghost stories have an economic impact, supporting heritage centres, and a cultural impact, on how people think about religion, belief and different religious traditions. By working with creative practitioners in the arts, the research also has an impact on new music composition. Beneficiaries of the impact include members of the public with an interest in ghost folklore, musicians and creative practitioners, and heritage sites.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Harrisson’s 2013 monograph, *Dreams and Dreaming in the Roman Empire: Cultural Memory and Imagination* included a detailed consideration of ghost stories in which the ghost appeared through the medium of a dream. This research demonstrated that in some ways, the ways ancient Greeks and Romans thought about ghosts and their relationship with reality and belief were quite different from the ways in which modern ghost Western stories are shared and thought about. 

 However, there are some similarities between ancient and modern attitudes to ghost stories and to the relationship between the telling of ghost stories and afterlife belief. In a 2019 article in her own edited collection *Imagining the Afterlife in the Ancient World*, Dr Harrisson compared modern online ghost folklore with the use of ghost folklore in a 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE Latin poem, finding that in both cases, there is a deliberate ambiguity in the relationship between truth and fiction in the telling of ghost stories. Both storyteller and receiver accept the likelihood that the story is not ‘true’, while at the same time maintaining an illusion of ‘truth’ that is essential to full enjoyment of the story. This was published in the 2019 article ‘Reality and Unreality: Literature and Folklore in Propertius 4.7’. 

 Modern ghost folklore remains extremely popular, but is primarily focused on ghost stories – whether ‘true’ ghost folklore or literary fiction – from the nineteenth century onwards. The key aspect of Dr Harrisson’s research that underlies the impact is her work on ancient ghost stories and their relationship to ancient folklore, religion and belief. This work goes beyond assuming that if an ancient text tells a ghost story, all readers believed in it literally, exploring the extent of ghost belief and the importance of other factors in the telling of ghost narratives in the ancient world. There was a flurry of activity on ancient ghost literature around 1999 \(with the publication of both Sarah Iles Johnston’s *Restless Dead* and Debbie Felton’s *Haunted Greece and Rome*\) but little in the intervening years, and much of Johnston and Felton’s work laid the groundwork for later study, setting out the broad parameters of ancient ghost folklore rather than exploring the issue of belief in depth. Works on ancient ghost stories are also not well known outside the academy, despite widespread interest in ghost folklore in general. 

 Due to the comparative nature of Dr Harrisson’s work, the research impact goes two ways. Dr Harrisson is able to share her work on ancient ghost folklore with a wider audience, who in turn can share more modern ghost folklore with her, providing rich material for comparative research in the future. This process has continued throughout 2020, as several of Dr Harrisson’s students at Newman University have collected ghost stories online or from friends and family members as part of a university project, which will be used in further research. The project will culminate in a monograph in 2024\-5.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Harrisson has researched ancient ghost stories and disseminated key similarities and differences between these and modern ghost folklore through two key means; the ‘Creepy Classics’ podcast, which has produced monthly episodes since 31 October 2019, and an ‘Anti\-Valentines Ghost Stories’ event at the Coffin Works, Birmingham, held in February 2020. 

 There have been three main beneficiaries of the research impact: the heritage site The Coffin Works in Birmingham, the composer with whom Dr Harrisson has been working \(Ed Harrisson\), and members of the general public with an interest in ghost folklore. 

 <ins>Creepy Classics Podcast</ins> 

 Building on Harrisson’s reputation as a specialist in understanding the intersection of modern and ancient folklore beliefs, the podcast ‘Creepy Classics’ was launched in October 2019, hosted on the platform Podbean, with episodes available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Each month, Harrisson selects one ghost story to present and analyse. The podcast brings together dramatic readings of historic ghost stories with historical and literary analysis. Several episodes included leading experts on storytelling and folklore, including Liz Gloyn \(Royal Holloway\), Tony Keen \(University of Notre Dame in London\) and Olivia Knops \(Birmingham\), bringing academic expertise to a broad audience. 

 To date, there have been eighteen episodes of ‘Creepy Classics’. Between October 2019 and 31 December 2020, the ten most popular episodes of the podcast received over 2,000 downloads combined. The podcast has an international reach with around 1,400 listeners from the United States, 500 from the UK and 400 from France. 

 The podcast has enjoyed specific cultural impact. For example, following an episode on a story from Petronius, *Satyricon*, 61\-62, children’s author Caroline Lawrence re\-tweeted the episode, with a picture of an ancient werewolf. Twitter user @roughtradeX responded saying, “Ancient Romans believed in werewolves?” When this was confirmed, roughtradeX said “I thought it was only a Slavic myth” This demonstrates that the podcast is having a cultural impact and changing people’s minds about ancient Roman culture. 

 <ins>Anti\-Valentine’s Public Engagement</ins> 

 The Coffin Works in Birmingham were approached as partners in a public engagement event for several reasons. Newman University has a long\-standing relationship with the organisation, and the museum also has a strong reputation in enhancing public awareness and understanding relating to ghost folklore \(for example, ‘Canterville Ghost’, a Victorian theatrical event put on 31 October 2019, ‘A Wreath of Festive Frights’, 27<sup>th</sup> November 2019, and ‘Restless Graves’, a Zoom event held on 29 October 2020;  [http://www.coffinworks.org/past\-events/](http://www.coffinworks.org/past-events/)\). The museum allows visitors to sit surrounded by the paraphernalia of Victorian death while listening to ghost stories being re\-told, which creates an atmospheric and memorable event, forcing those present to reflect on cultural aspects of dying and death. The events represented a close collaboration between Harrisson and the museum. 

 The theme of an ‘anti\-Valentine’s’ event was chosen because the site already has successful programmes of events on more recent ghost folklore running around Halloween and Christmas, but an ‘alternative’ Valentine’s celebration presented a gap in the market; this was also particularly suitable for the ancient material, as several ancient ghost stories relate to romantic or sexual relationships, but often in dark ways. Audience members were asked to complete a short anonymous questionnaire after the event, and several mentioned that what had attracted them to come was the idea of something “unusual” to do for Valentine’s Day. 

 The event at the Coffin Works had a positive economic impact on the heritage site, as it sold 26 tickets and made £300 for the site \(this is near to maximum capacity\). At the event, audience members were given a short anonymous questionnaire, asking them what had interested them in the event and whether there was anything they learned that surprised them. Responses to this second question included “How classic ghost stories have such impact in modern stories”; “The different types of oracles and the various ways ghosts were referred to in the ancient world”; “it’s an area of Classics I haven’t really delved into. Excellent, will look out for the podcast\!”, and “the range of ghost stories from ancient texts”. These responses demonstrate a clear cultural impact from the event.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Essex NLIP research resulted in the development of an online platform for secure real\-time civilian\-led reporting of human rights violations in conflict zones providing more accurate monitoring in areas inaccessible to traditional human rights monitoring missions. International human rights organisation, Minority Rights Group International \(MRG\) and the Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights, deployed the platform between 2017 and 2019 in Iraq, Iran, Syria, the Middle East and North Africa. In Iraq more than 3,700 cases of human rights violations were documented using the platform since 2017. The platform has enabled MRG to grow its activities and was essential for the establishment and operation of Ceasefire, furthering the practice of civilian\-based monitoring of violations. This secure and easy to use platform has empowered and enabled ordinary civilians to document violations, mitigating the risks associated with reporting of human rights abuses in conflict situations. The evidence of human rights violations obtained from the platform has enabled documentation of claims for reparations, to compensate the victims of human rights abuses \(cases documented on the platform can form the basis for reparations claims under the Iraqi national Law 20 reparations system, which has paid out over USD 355 million in compensation\) and for international oversight, generating reports which have been used by the United Nations \(UN\), ultimately improving human rights outcomes for civilians. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Essex Natural Language Information Processing \(NLIP\) researchers collaborated with MRG and the Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights \(Ceasefire hereafter\) from 2014 to design and implement a new platform to support civilian\-led monitoring of human rights violations \[G1\]. Their challenge was to develop a reporting platform which would enable civilian\-led reporting in inaccessible areas which would be secure, easy to use and be able to assess the accuracy of reports, supporting both English and Arabic languages. Developing a platform for this purpose was particularly challenging as Arabic is an under\-resourced language in NLP and requires a unique set of skills. The research of the NLIP team, on information extraction from social media, Arabic natural language processing and crowdsourcing addressed these challenges. 

 The Essex research provided insights into crowdsourcing which focused on determining a ""gold standard"" based on a large number of individual statements with varying degree of reliability e.g., \[R1\]. The reporting platform was a development of Ushadhidi, an open\-source crowdsourcing platform used to map reports of violence, but its security model was insufficient for Ceasefire's needs. The Essex researchers developed a new security model and user access control, providing additional structural support for collaborating organisations with additional structural and security modifications \[R2\]. Essex’s Arabic natural language processing toolkit \(AraNLP\) \[R3\] together with  methodology to identify named entities \(e.g., names of people and places\) which describes how names, places and dates can be extracted \[R4\], provides the basis of the Arabic text processing pipeline that automatically processes social media texts to identify potential human rights violations. AI\-powered approaches for classifying massive amounts of data into pre\-defined categories need enough reliable training data and machine learning algorithms of sufficiently high classification quality. This was addressed by Essex research on extracting and managing content from social media, using crowdsourcing techniques to label and evaluate the collected data and the framework for using crowdsourcing to create language resources for under\-resourced languages such as Arabic \[R5\] \[R6\]. The Essex language resource of Arabic texts representing different types of violence including human\-rights violations \[R7\] was the first such resource. This addressed the lack of previous work on detecting human rights violation in English and Arabic, the modest accuracy of existing methods and the paucity in robust and scalable resources to process Arabic natural language. One reason for this is the difficulty in applying methods developed for languages such as English to Arabic, a highly derivational and inflectional language that is characterised by a complex set of morphological features including gender, number, person, case, state, mood, and voice. In addition, Arabic has a set of clitics, which attach to the stem after affixes such as conjunctions, prepositions, future marks, definite articles, and pronouns. \[R2\] reports Essex’s insights into mining and classifying Arabic Twitter in order to identify potential human rights abuse incidents in a continuous stream of social media data within a specified geographical region. Essex’s analysis showed deep learning approaches such as Long Short\-Term Memory \(LSTM\) classification precision was 84% with an F1\-score of 75%. The practical usefulness of the Twitter mining tool for the analysts’ work was also demonstrated and was deemed of high enough quality to be used in the practical setting \[R2\]. 

 This Essex research resulted in a new platform for Ceasefire \(Fig.1\), described in \[R2\], which monitors human rights violations within a specified geographic area via \(i\) a structured reporting system which experts and individual witnesses submit to, enabling civilian\-led monitoring, combined with \(ii\) AI mining of social media yielding a continuous stream of data which have been classified as signals of potential violations within the same region. Essex's system constituted the portal first portal of its kind which combines \(i\) and \(ii\). The platform’s sources include reports submitted by users directly to the website, email and SMS, Twitter, and mainstream news reports, in both Arabic and English \[R2\]. Reports submitted through the form are stripped of personally identifying information and plotted onto a live, interactive map visible on the tool’s landing page, which shows the distribution of violations by location and type. Sensitive personal data is stored securely on a secondary server in case it is needed for future follow\-up or court proceedings. The reports obtained are made available to partner organisations and the public at the same portal web interface where reports are submitted.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Developing and implementing a secure reporting platform enabling civilians to document human rights violations**</ins> 

 The ability of traditional human rights monitoring via investigative missions to work effectively and achieve their aims is challenged by restricted access to insecure territories, as well as cost, time, questions over politicisation, oversight, legitimacy and representation. With advances in communications technology, civilian\-led monitoring in conflict zones has become a complementary, and sometimes the principal, source of information on human rights violations \[S1\]. Although new technologies provided hardware for civilians to report violations in theory, obtaining reliable human rights data and information that can be documented required a new system. Essex NLIP researchers collaborated with MRG \(a leading international human rights organisation, with over 150 partners across 60 countries\) \[S2\] and Ceasefire \(founded in 2014 as an in\-house centre of specialist expertise on civilian\-led monitoring within MRG\) on the 2014\-2017 Ceasefire Programme to develop and implement such a system of civilian\-led monitoring of human rights abuses \[S3\]. 

 The Executive Director \(ED\) of Ceasefire \(and former ED of MRG until 2018\) confirms that ‘ **Essex’s NLIP research was applied to develop the essential technological infrastructure to support civilian\-led monitoring**, including dual Arabic/English language reporting, as well as techniques for social media data mining*. *Specifically, they **developed an integrated online platform** to receive and process information from sources, including reports submitted by users directly to the website, email and SMS, information posted on Twitter, and mainstream news reports, in both Arabic and English which was critical to the Ceasefire programme’s success*’ \[R2\] \[S3\]. They add: ‘ **Essex's specialist insights in Arabic NLP, working in areas such as text summarisation and named entity extraction, provided the essential foundations for developing the platform**’ \[e.g. R3\] and ‘ *through further research in a project funded by MRG and Innovate UK, the NLIP researchers constructed the online Ceasefire platform \[…\]* *Essex’s NLIP research was the essential basis for that project’s results*’ \[R1\-7\] \[S3\]. The Ceasefire platform comprised two technological developments: A violations reporting form, allowing users to submit reports of violations directly to the website and the addition of social media data mining tools to the website, allowing information on human rights violations to be automatically harvested from Arabic language Twitter feeds \[R2\] \[S3\]. Importantly ‘ **Essex’s NLIP research provided the capability to adapt and enhance the systems for new environments**, and in line with changing modes of communication*’ so that the reporting platform is ‘ *applicable to different contexts, and conflict situations*’ \[S3\]. The development of **this new platform was** ‘ **essential for the success of the Ceasefire programme which has empowered civilians subject to violations in highly insecure environments**’** \[S3\]. 

  

 This reporting platform was piloted by MRG and Ceasefire in Iraq in 2016 with MRG’s partner organisations, including Asuda \- Combating Violence against Women, then  publicly rolled out in Iraq in 2017, Iran in 2018, part of Syria in 2019 and more widely across the Middle East and North Africa in 2019 \[S3\]. Accessible to anyone with an internet connection, **the platform empowers and enables ordinary civilians to document violations of their rights in a way that conforms to international legal standards and increases the future usability of the data** \[S3, S4 p.57\]. The creation of a safe, secure and easy to use platform \[R2\] has helped to **mitigate the risks to those reporting human rights abuses in conflict situations**, including civilians, journalists and humanitarian agencies \[S4\]. ‘ *In the current situation in Iraq, the major risk facing human rights activists and defenders is reporting violations \[...\] The online tool helps them prevent these risks as they easily use the tool and it is anonymous.*’ Director of an Iraqi NGO \[S4 p 58\]. For civilians, the platform enables them to report incidents at any time and in a more conﬁdential way than talking with a representative of an NGO, which could be under surveillance \[S4\]. In Iraq more than **3,700** cases of human rights violations were documented using the platform since 2017 \[S3, S4 p. 58\], several hundred in Syria since 2019 – ‘ **a considerable body of documentary evidence of violations**’** \[S3\]. In addition to the violations reported via the platform, **information harvested from social media alerts the relevant authorities to violations, providing a means of early warning** \[S3\]. ‘ *The Twitter crawler also provides real\-time information on the popular reaction to reports of violations, giving us a perspective on people’s attitudes to human rights abuses, including at local level*’ \[S3\]. 

 <ins> **Contributing to the work of UN bodies, increasing the availability of reparations and improving human rights outcomes**</ins> 

 Data obtained from the reporting platform contributes evidence for influential reports \[e.g. S5a, b\] submitted by MRG/Ceasefire to UN bodies for international oversight of human rights issues. Ceasefire’s ED states ‘ **Different UN mechanisms use the information provided as a result of the tool** and some have referred to our reports which the platform provided essential evidence for*’ \[S3\]. For example, *‘our work on Iran, based partly on one of the tools, was quoted by the UN Secretary\-General in his report on Iran for the UN General Assembly in 2019* \[see S6 p15\] *. This is the most significant and authoritative annual report on human rights in the country’* \[S3\]. When protests erupted in Iraq in 2018, reports of excessive use of force by security forces against peaceful protesters began to appear on platform. These cases were incorporated into a wider report on repression of civilian activists in Iraq \[S5a\] which was then used as a basis for urgent appeals and advocacy pushes at the UN Human Rights Council and other forums \[S4\].  Ceasefire have a strong record of having their recommendations on human rights adopted: *‘we made a total of 63 separate recommendations on Iraq to the UN Universal Periodic Review, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; of these, 28 were fully adopted and 16 partially adopted by the relevant UN body’* Ceasefire ED \[S3\]. 

 The evidence of human rights violations obtained from the platform has also **enabled documentation of claims for reparations, to compensate the victims of human rights abuses** \[S3\]. ‘ **Cases documented on the platform can form the basis for reparations claims** **under the Iraqi national Law 20 reparations system**, which has paid out over USD 355 million in compensation. This aided our cooperation with the UN assistance mission in Iraq and with the Iraqi Parliament: we subsequently formed an agreement with the Iraqi Human Rights Committee to provide technical assistance on the drafting of new human rights legislation. We also have a developing relationship with IOM \(International Organization for Migration\) because they have taken a particular interest in reparations.’* Ceasefire ED \[S3\]. By enabling the development of the platform, the Essex NLIP research has ultimately ‘ **empowered civilians subject to violations in highly insecure environments and boosted the availability of reparations. This had a major effect on human rights outcomes**’** Ceasefire ED \[S3\]. 

 <ins> **Supporting</ins> <ins>MRG</ins><ins>’s</ins> <ins>human rights operations</ins> <ins></ins><ins>and the establishment of Ceasefire</ins> <ins>furthering the practice of civil society based monitoring of violations**</ins>  <ins> </ins> 

 Through the development of the new platform, Essex research enabled MRG **‘ **to develop a major new area of expertise**’* \[S7\] and *‘provided the technology for the system to enable civilian\-led reporting of human rights abuses which Ceasefire’s work depends upon and was thereby **an essential factor in establishing and maintaining Ceasefire, furthering the practice of civil society based monitoring of violations**. This in turn helped Ceasefire and MRG to secure significant new external funds for related projects, including the award of a new EUR1,000,000 project by the EU’* \[S3\], \[S7, p4\]. MRG is financed by donations and grants from foreign governments, trusts and foundations, and from individual donations \[S7, p2\]. The increase in its income from a year before the project began to 2017 was almost entirely attributed to the platform \(S7, p5\-6, items 9 and 10, pages 5\-6\). MRG’s staff acquired new skills in the management of online reporting platforms, improved understanding of user needs and behaviour in the reporting of human rights violations on the ground, better appreciation of the adaptation of international standards on human rights monitoring and reporting, as well as a wider awareness of digital advances to support the human rights movement generally \[S7 p5\]. Furthermore, ‘ *training in the use of the reporting platform has been undertaken on two occasions for civil society organisations in Iraq*’ \[S7 p5\]. MRG also employed a new Programme coordinator to implement the results of the project \[S7 p8\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research at the University of Bath on threats to financial stability from inadequate monitoring and risk assessments of the financial system \(led by Dr Giansante\) has informed policy changes in the central banks and regulatory institutions of G20 countries. It has led to the adoption of new processes and the enhancement of strategies for financial stability. A framework for measuring ‘interconnectedness’ was developed to assess the overall risk of a crisis in the financial system and identify which institutions were contributing most to instability. The framework has been operationalised within the Reserve Bank of India. It has also shaped the work of Banque de France and the International Monetary Fund on global stability. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The global financial crisis of 2007/08 highlighted a lack of understanding among economists and financial regulators on the importance of the interconnectedness of financial institutions, both nationally and globally. The deficiencies in regulation that the crisis exposed led \(among other initiatives\) to the Basel III banking standard. This highlighted the issue of excessive interconnectedness among ‘systemically important financial institutions’ \(SIFIs\) as a primary cause of systemic risk. The crisis also raised questions about the transmission channels between the financial and real sides of the economy. Mainstream macroeconomic models envisaged a representative banking sector that did not face problems of illiquidity or insolvency. They were therefore unlikely to predict the domino\-like failures that became a reality during the financial crisis. 

 The issue behind the underpinning research at University of Bath concerned the high concentration of risk among a handful of large US investment banks and the need to develop a policy response to what has become known as ‘macroprudential regulation’. A key research question related to concerns about the dense interconnections through ‘credit default swaps’, a form of debt insurance between banks. To address this question, Giansante \(with Markose and Shaghaghi, University of Essex\) developed a new method to assess systemic risk and forecast financial meltdowns based on a network approach to understanding complex financial linkages among global financial institutions \(R1\). Giansante \(with Markose and Oluwasegun, University of Essex\) used a ‘multi\-agent financial network’ model to quantify the contribution of each institution to financial instability and define the SIFIs that might require targeted intervention by central banks or financial regulators \(R3\). Giansante \(with Krause, University of Bath\) disentangled the complexity of solvency shocks and liquidity shortfalls among financial institutions to fit the new Basel III criteria on banks’ capital adequacy and liquidity \(R2\). 

 A key insight from the research was the importance of central banks and financial regulators collecting detailed data on bilateral contracts among financial institutions in order to assess the extent of interconnectedness and its potential contribution to systemic risk \(R1\). The results also provided evidence of the complex interplay among liquidity and solvency shocks in contributing to the spread of contagion between financial institutions that can lead to a systemic crisis \(R2\). The researchers concluded their analysis by recommending the adoption of an early warning real\-time financial networks approach based on bilateral leverage data that regulators could use to monitor financial institutions, internalise potential threats of systemic risk, and prevent future financial crises.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 This research has directly informed policy changes in central banks and regulatory institutions. The software developed by the research team has been a key mechanism for the adoption of new processes and systems by the Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\) and in relation to the enhancement of strategy for financial stability \(S1, S2\). The benefits to the Indian financial system, shared with all G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors during the quarterly Financial Stability Board meetings, promoted interest from European banks and financial institutions, including Banque de France and the IMF. The research team contributed to the Financial Stability Review of Banque de France \(S3\) and their influence was publicly acknowledged by the Governor of Banque de France \(S4\). The benefits of this research have also been acknowledged by the IMF and incorporated into the IMF’s auditing and advice to central banks \(S5\). 

 **The Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\) \(2013 – 2020\)** 

 The research informed the implementation and operationalisation of 2 new models for policy analysis in RBI: \(1\) A systemic risk network model of interconnectedness to map the entire Indian financial system along with assessment of financial systems in other countries; \(2\) A risk assessment contagion model that investigates both solvency shocks and liquidity shortfalls in accordance with Basel III pillars \(S5\). The models, in the form of bespoke software, provide the means to gather granular information, to assess its implications for systemic risk, and to make targeted interventions \(S2\). Both models were initially developed and implemented between 2011 and 2015. Between August 2013 and December 2020, they have been fully embedded into the current RBI systemic risk monitoring framework \(S1\) and outcomes are published in the RBI semi\-annual Financial Stability Reports \(S2\). 

 The process of this contribution was as follows. First, working with the members of RBI’s Financial Stability Unit \(FSU\), the research team developed a contextually specific conceptual framework and software through which to operationalise a data\-driven model of interconnectedness of the Indian financial system. This allowed the FSU to monitor and manage systemic risk within and across multiple financial sectors. Second, the new models for analysis made it possible to collect data on the bilateral positions of more than 70 leading financial institutions, including public, private and foreign banks, cooperative banks, mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies. This dramatically changed the way that the RBI mandated and analysed financial positions among institutions. Dr Giansante provided training for the FSU team in the meticulous gathering of detailed information, and was part of the analysis process with RBI Deputy Governors, Executive Directors and Division Heads. The Assistant General Manager of the RBI stated: 

 “*A multi\-layer financial network software was developed by Dr Giansante …, which is used to assess the interconnectedness, liquidity and solvency of risks of the Indian financial systems. As the project was done over a period of four years … Giansante had interactions with top management and apprised them about the nuances and significance of the model … \[and\] trained RBI personal in the use of the network model*” \(S1\). 

 The software solution has been fully adopted by the RBI as its main risk assessment tool for the interconnectedness and contagion risks of financial institutions. As an example, the new system informed RBI about the decline of the interbank market size with risk of financial contagion in the second semester of 2014, as highlighted in the FSR press release of December 2014: 

 “*Analysis of the interconnectedness indicates that the size of the interbank market in relation to total banking sector assets has been on a steady decline. However, contagion analysis with top five most connected banks reveals that the banking system could potentially lose significant portion of its total Tier\-I capital under the joint solvency\-liquidity condition in the event of a particular bank triggering a contagion*” \(S2\). 

 **Banque de France and the International Monetary Fund \(2016 – 2018\)** 

 As a result of the proven benefits for RBI, the research outcomes and related tools for risk assessment have also been disseminated in Europe, including for central counterparty clearing platforms. The Governor of Banque de France invited the research team to contribute to its 2017 Financial Stability Review \(S3\) and he has directly acknowledged the contribution made to the resilience of the global financial system \(S4\). Specifically, the stability review presents all major models for risk assessment adopted by financial regulators that have made the global financial system more robust since the G20 action plan of 2009. The Governor of Banque De France stated: 

 “*Thank you very much for the high\-quality contribution you make to the Financial Stability Review of Banque de France on the impact of financial reforms. This 21st edition shows that the banking and financial regulations adopted since the crisis constitute a major acquis \[body of knowledge\] to be preserved because they have made the financial system more robust … \[and\] the importance of the regular assessment of their impacts in order to consolidate this acquis*” \(S4\). 

 The achievement of these tools, including the research team models, has been echoed by other policymakers and financial practitioners, including Mark Carney \(Chair, FSB and then Governor, Bank of England\), Axel Weber \(Chairman, UBS\) and Tobias Adrian \(Director, IMF\) during the IMF Spring Meetings in Washington on the 20 April 2017 for the presentation of the review document \(S5\). The benefits of the research have also been acknowledged by the IMF and the models have been included in the IMF’s auditing and advice to central banks \(S5\). 

 In addition to RBI, Banque de France and the IMF, direct support has been provided by Dr Giansante to the Bank of Finland \(2014\) to monitor systemic risk in China and Russia \(S6\), to Banca d’Italia \(2015\) on the development of ‘interbank networks’ \(S7\), and to Banco de Mexico \(2016\) on the implementation of network models, stress testing and financial stability monitoring \(S8\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 UoP research has led to the development and implementation of water management technologies. New treatment technologies and site modelling implemented by a major UK water company improved wastewater treatment performance giving enhanced environmental protection and substantial cost savings.  Increased performance of novel and enhanced package sewage treatment plants has reduced cost and stimulated commercial growth of SMEs. Research on blue\-green water management systems has informed policy, improved environmental protection and provided commercial benefits to industrial collaborators. Lastly, novel soil washing technology has been developed and applied to achieve large scale hydrocarbon remediation at industrial sites. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UoP research has led to the development and implementation of novel wastewater technologies. Research is undertaken at our unique Environmental Technology Field Station \(ETFS\) or at real\-world sites to understand wastewater treatment processes through a combination of fundamental science and engineering approaches. The body of research underpinning the impact is across four technologies in particular: 

-  Conventional Small waste\-water treatment works \(WwTW\) 

-  Package treatment plants 

-  Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) 

-  Novel materials in combination with natural systems for wastewater treatment 

 The team apply a range of approaches, for example: focusing on specific pollutants \(e.g. phosphorous, hydrocarbons\), optimising design and operation, and/or demonstrating the efficacy of technologies in real\-world settings. 

 The UoP ETFS is a unique facility located at a waste\-water treatment works which was extensively upgraded in 2015 with a UoP investment of over GBP150,000.  Pumped sewage supplies from various WwTW stages allow research at operationally relevant pilot\-plant scales.  Test bed facilities, including a 20m greenhouse and dedicated laboratories, also allow environmental technologies and monitoring to be assessed at scales and intensities relevant to real world applications.  The overarching objective of the multidisciplinary research is to characterise high variable environmental technologies and systems with extensive multivariate monitoring. This alongside detailed mechanistic studies contribute to the design and operation codes for improving the performance of environmental technologies. 

 Research using large\-scale pilot plants at the ETFS currently involves industrial collaborations with the regional water utility Southern Water \(SW\) \(G1\) and WPL Ltd \(G3, G4\). Research with SW encompasses several technologies that address their current Research & Development \(R&D\) concerns such as increasing the technological options for phosphorus \(P\) removal from effluents, especially at their hundreds of small waste water treatment plants.  Discharge consents are becoming more strict and commonly used options to mitigate negative environmental impacts at large sites, such as chemical \(ferric\) dosing, pose significant operational challenges at smaller sites, making the same interventions economically unsustainable. A potential alternative is to use granular materials that can remove P from wastewater, utilising mechanisms such as precipitation and adsorption, through passive filters.  A key piece of research with SW has therefore been improving the understanding of the kinetics of phosphorous attachment to these “reactive media” through large\-scale long\-term comparative studies of different media, using real sewage, rather than laboratory simulations \(G2\).  This has highlighted the interaction of uptake rates and ultimate uptake capacity over various flow regimes and hydraulic residence times. This has been augmented by characterisation of deposits using advanced imaging and analysis techniques at the UoP \(XRD, XRF, SEM\-EDAX\) to inform understanding of the mechanisms and potential for nutrient recovery \(R1\).  Some of these materials increase effluent pH, so passive pH correction experiments have also been undertaken to allow these effluents to be released.  Other studies with SW have examined immobilised bacteria for P removal and novel methods for optimising and diagnosing WwTW operations, based on modelling and analysis of historic data to improve treatment performance and inform future treatment requirements \(R2\). 

 Collaborative R&D with WPL has been in operation throughout this REF period \(G3, G4\). WPL Ltd provide a range of products and services to the water sector including  “package” wastewater treatment plants, where a series of processes in one container provide treatment solutions typically used at small WwTP or where mains sewerage is not available. The application of these technologies are deployed around the world in low, middle and high income countries. Their long established submerged aerated filter range has been refined through a series of monitoring full\-scale units installed at the ETFS and operated under modified aeration patterns and various internal configurations.  This has informed the development of numerical models to develop optimised aeration and design strategies to reduce energy use. 

 The group has a >40 year track record of research into blue\-green water technologies in the UK and overseas, particularly focussed on using wetland plants to promote treatment \(R3, R4, R5, R6\).  In addition, our focus on wetlands has extended to Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) and the research at the ETFS has focussed on characterising pollutant removal in vegetated systems. The international consultancy Mott MacDonald and the Highways Agency funded a study of detention ponds to manage flows and treat runoff from trunk roads.  This assessed treatment performance and the fate of metals and hydrocarbons, through intensive multivariate monitoring of field systems. This characterised accumulation rates and speciation of metals that were uncertain at the time and key to long term management and performance \(R4\).  Research into the treatment performance of SuDS in housing developments \(with infrastructure consultancy Mayer Brown Ltd and the Environment Agency\) demonstrated the pollutant removal capacity of swales and vegetated ponds, particularly for metals and hydrocarbons \(G5, G6\).  Following these field studies, modelling studies used computational fluid dynamics to examine how pond geometry can enhance sedimentation, and the understanding of Poly\-cyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon removal rates in swales was enhanced through monitoring a 10m greenhouse model fed with simulated storms mimicking polluted road runoff.  The various economic, policy and social barriers to SuDS uptake in England were investigated in a NERC Green Infrastructure Innovation project, ProSuDS \(R5, G7\), which included evaluation of residents’ perceptions \(R5\).  Studies of hydrocarbon treatment in SuDS have also been extended to phytoremediation studies of contaminated land \(R6, G8\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Introduction** 

 Research undertaken at the ETFS has underpinned the development and application of novel wastewater technologies leading to significant commercial and environmental benefits within the REF period. This impact is demonstrated through five key strands: 

 1.            Improved performance and cost savings for a major UK water company; 

 2.            Influencing national policy for the implementation of SuDS; 

 3.            Economic growth and job creation for UK SMEs; 

 4.            Innovation and new product/service for Kuwaiti energy technology company; 

 5.            Environmental and amenity benefits through strands 2\-4. 

 **Background: Impact through industrial collaboration** 

 A major component of our impact has occurred through collaborative, industrially funded research investigating wastewater treatment mechanisms and performance.  Our research has provided an evidence base for improvements to the performance or efficiency of the technology, essentially underpinned by our research contributions that have led to a more complete understanding of the underlying treatment processes, and also the development of independently assessed evidence that can further support the adoption and commercialisation of the technology.  This is valuable for SME innovators, as the UK wastewater industry is traditionally risk adverse and requires robust evidence before adopting new technologies. 

 **Impact strand 1: Improved performance and cost savings for a major UK company** 

 The University’s long term strategic partnership with Southern Water \(SW\) led to “The Hub” being established at the ETFS in 2017. The University employs 2 dedicated full\-time scientific officers at The Hub to carry out research onsite and act as a bridge to the research expertise and facilities at the University of Portsmouth thus expanding the R&D capacity of SW.  This research has focussed on assessing phosphorus \(P\) removal from effluents, particularly for small WwTP where increasingly tight discharge consents challenge the efficacy and economic viability of conventional technologies.  Southern Water operates 367 WwTW, of which 224 serve <ins><</ins>2,000 people and 136 <ins><</ins>500. Installing the most common P solution, chemical dosing, could cost over GBP100,000 for each site requiring significant investment and increased costs for customers.  A number of technologies have been evaluated to increase SW’s approved list of options, to date this has involved practical research studies into treatment options for P removal such as enhanced dosing/coagulation, electrocoagulation and immobilised bacteria at both the laboratory and pilot plant scales. These studies have resulted in systematic technical reports used by SW in investment decisions and provided design guidance to SW’s Engineering and Technical Services informing in\-house design of WwTP. SW stated: **""Research outcomes and other support provided by The Hub have increased our options to meet future regulations and reduced our reliance on existing, highly expensive, solutions""** \(S1\). Furthermore, data from these and other studies conducted by the team underpinned new models that enabled simple visualisation of stress to wastewater treatment plan informing operation and capacity at WwTW.  This work led SW to a saving of GBP8,500,000 on plans for future investment. SW stated: **“The Hub provided an intensive monitoring campaign, analysis and calibration of modelling to assess process resilience in real time, which provided realised capital benefits of GBP8.5million**” \(S2\). SW has also benefited from the contributions that the publicity, conference presentations and academic papers resulting from the collaboration make to its Public Relations strategy, by demonstrating its commitment and investment in improving environmental performance and process efficiency to customers and regulators \(S2\). 

 **Impact Strand 2: Influencing national policy for the implementation of SuDS** 

 Our research in the use of wetlands and sustainable drainage systems \(SuDS\) has promoted the national use of nature\-based solutions for improving water management; adding to the stock of validated case studies that demonstrate the value of SuDS to policy makers and informing design guidance for pollutant removal.  This influenced the 2006 policy of the Highways Agency \(Design Manual for Roads and Bridges: Vegetated Drainage Systems for Highway Runoff \(DMRB HA 103/06 \(S3\)\), that has seen wider uptake of vegetated SuDS on the road network in the period 2013\-2020 \(S4\). Highways England stated: **“This work influenced our policy and informed past and current practice in relation to road runoff control in vegetated systems. Vegetated detention pond systems are now an integral part of highway design and the runoff management treatment providing enhanced environmental protection for many watercourses.”** Major infrastructure projects in this period \(e.g. A1, A14 improvements\) have included vegetated drainage systems designed in accordance with DMRB HA 103/06. 

 **Impact Strand 3: Economic growth and job creation for SMEs** 

 A number of SMEs have also exploited the research expertise and ETFS test facilities to develop novel package sewage treatment plants and improved performance, and therefore competitiveness of existing products.  The strongest example of this is the long term collaboration with WPL who, in addition to large scale installations for water utilities, provide package sewage treatment plants to homes and communities not connected to the main sewerage network. The company has used the outcomes of research collaboration to develop a novel package technology for sludge management and made several refinements to the design of the aeration systems of the HiPAF Submerged Aerated Filters that have maintained the competitiveness of this well established technology; WPL sell  >50 plants a year ranging in scale from 150 to 1,000 population.  WPL stated: **“The research has supported the growth and economic prosperity of a local SME contributing to over GBP3million of sales and an estimated 20 jobs in the supply chain.” \(S3\).  Another SME, Mayer Brown Ltd, exploited the outcomes of our SuDS research to secure new clients. Our research validated the performance of their vegetated SuDS designs in housing developments. This led to commercial benefits in the form of increased sales in the REF period \(estimated GBP300,000\) \(S5\). 

 **Impact strand 4: Innovative new product/service for Kuwaiti energy technology company** 

 The team developed expertise in green\-blue water technologies for the removal of hydrocarbons \(R6\). This expertise was developed further through a Kuwaiti government funded PhD that developed a novel soil washing technology using bio\-surfactants from natural products and ultrasound. This ex\-student has since patented the process in the US and Gulf States \(US10072469B2 \(S6\) and GC0006708 \(S7\)\).  The technology has been through several stages of scale\-up trials in collaboration with the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research.  The technology has been certified for full\-scale use by the Kuwait Oil Company and has so far remediated a decommissioned oil production facility and a refinery.  The technology is now being applied to other contaminated sites significantly contributing to environmental protection \(S8\). 

 **Impact strand 5:** **Environmental and amenity benefits** 

 In addition to the commercial and policy benefits there is a significant environmental benefit arising from the implementation of the technologies described in impact strands \(IS\) 2 to 4: SuDS built to design standard DMRB HA 103/06 in the period \(IS2\), small\-scale WwTP installed by WPL Ltd \(IS3\), and the two field sites for the novel hydrocarbon remediation \(IS4\). Benefits are reduced pollution, and enhanced ecological and amenity quality in natural water bodies.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Anti\-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody associated vasculitis \(AAV\) is a group of rare but aggressive diseases that cause inflammation of blood vessels, with the restricted blood flow leading to severe organ damage. Currently, 115,000 people are suffering from AAV across Europe and the USA, with at least 7,500 new cases diagnosed each year. Research led by the University of Cambridge has optimised existing therapies and introduced new treatments of AAV, directly improving the survival, health and well\-being of patients. This improvement in therapies has produced more rapid and prolonged disease remission and reduced treatment\-associated toxicities; thereby increasing patients’ quality of life and five\-year survival. Insights from this research have been incorporated into guidelines, NHS policy and healthcare provision for patients, and produced annual health\-cost savings of GBP45,000,000. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The destruction and inflammation of blood vessels caused by the autoimmune disease AAV, reduces blood flow to vital organs resulting in severe damage, including renal failure and pulmonary haemorrhage. As an autoimmune disease, conventional treatment of AAV includes immunosuppression combined with high\-dose steroid administration, but this fails in 40% of patients and 50% suffer devastating side effects. 

 Jayne and Cambridge\-based colleagues have led the development of research methodology and 10 international randomised clinical trials in AAV, resulting in the evidence\-based optimisation of existing treatments and introduction of new therapies. This global effort was facilitated by the European Vasculitis Society \(EUVAS\), founded by Jayne in 2011, and its subsequent growth into a world\-wide network. 

 <ins> **Developing</ins> <ins>safer</ins> <ins></ins><ins>conventional</ins> <ins>treatment approaches</ins><ins>**</ins> 

 Cyclophosphamide is an effective immunosuppressant that was used widely to treat AAV; however, the drug is highly toxic and can cause bleeding from the bladder, infertility and various cancers. These side effects often necessitate reducing or stopping cyclophosphamide treatment, causing AAV to return in up to half of patients. Therefore, Cambridge University researchers have led randomised clinical trials aimed at identifying effective and safer alternatives to cyclophosphamide \[1–3\]. The **CYCAZAREM** trial \(2000\) of azathioprine and subsequent **NORAM** trial \(1995\-2000\) of methotrexate \[2\] showed that cyclophosphamide can be replaced with less toxic therapies whilst maintaining remission. 

 Jayne and colleagues also led studies aimed at improving outcomes for those patients with the most severe disease. AAV patients who present with renal failure have an increased risk of developing end stage renal failure and death despite immunosuppressive therapy. The Cambridge\-led **MEPEX** study \(1995\-2002\) recruited 137 patients across 25 centres and showed that plasma exchange could safely increase the rate of renal recovery when compared with high\-dose steroids \[3\]. 

 To spare patients some of the serious side effects of steroid therapy, the Cambridge\-led **PEXIVAS** study \(2010\-2016\) recruited 704 patients with AAV from 112 sites across four continents and validated both the efficacy and safety of rapidly reducing the steroid dosage, decreasing serious infection complications in patients by 20% \[4\]. 

 <ins> **Developing treatment to prevent relapse</ins> <ins>and reduce co\-morbidit</ins><ins>ies**</ins> 

 Perhaps most significantly, between 2010 and 2016 Jayne and colleagues led the European trials of **rituximab** therapy of AAV. Rituximab is a therapeutic antibody which reduces inflammation by targeting B cells. The **RITUXVAS** study showed rituximab to be as effective as cyclophosphamide at inducing remission with similar toxicity to azathioprine and methotrexate \[5\]. And, the **RITAZAEM** trial showed that two\-year, fixed\-interval rituximab dosing is more effective than azathioprine at preventing disease relapse following treatment \[5\]. Together with colleagues in the EUVAS, in a study of 323 patients, Jayne also showed that cancer risk in patients treated with rituximab was similar to that of the general population and significantly less than that of cyclophosphamide\-treated patients \[6\]. 

 <ins> **Introduction of newer</ins> <ins>vasculitis</ins> <ins>therapies**</ins> 

 Jayne led the **CLEAR** \(2011\-2016\) randomised, placebo\-controlled trial that showed avacopan, a new complement C5a receptor inhibitor, induces faster remission with fewer side effects than treatment with high\-dose steroids, thereby resulting in an increased quality of life and avoidance of steroid related harm \[7\]. In 2020 Jayne reported similar positive results of avacopan in an international Phase III trial of 330 patients \( **ADVOCATE,** 2017\-2019\) which has led to licensing submissions \[8\]. The **MIRRA** study \(2014\-2016\) demonstrated that using mepolizumab to treat the vasculitis Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis \(EGPA\), increased remission duration, permitted steroid reduction and reduced relapse rates. \[9\].

 <ins> **Impact on the health and wellbeing of people**</ins> 

 **Lives saved through earlier diagnosis:** Symptoms of vasculitis are easily confused with other illnesses, so the disease can go unrecognised for a long time. Decades of Cambridge University research has contributed to earlier diagnosis of patients by increasing awareness of AAV and training physicians with interest in this disease. The improvement of quality of services for patients in the UK, 1,000 of whom receive treatment from the Cambridge Vasculitis Service, has enhanced wellbeing and saved lives. As such, Vasculitis UK notes, *“the loss or reduction of this service \[Cambridge\-based research and treatment\] would represent the loss of a valuable resource and leave a huge gap in provision of care nationally for patients suffering from systemic vasculitis”* \[A\]. 

 **Lives saved by optimising treatment strategies:** Infection related to high\-dose steroid use is the major cause of treatment\-related death, owing to organ damage and hospital readmission among patients with AAV. Cambridge\-led trials, spanning two decades, have tested and led to the use of alternative, less toxic maintenance treatments \[1\-3\]. The results of the Cambridge led PEXIVAS Study in 2020 \[4\] led to an immediate change in practice, with physicians reducing steroid dose more rapidly across the NHS. This has reduced hospital readmissions by 20% and has become the new standard of care for patients with AAV \[B\]. The optimisation of these conventional AAV therapies has seen first year fatality rates fall from 50% in 2007 to under 25% in 2020 \[4,B\]. 

 **Access to novel therapies:** In March 2013, Cambridge\-led research was pivotal to the licensing of rituximab by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\). In 2018 new patient use of rituximab was 36% \[C\]. Use continues to grow as 63% of patients treated in Cambridge were using rituximab in 2020 \[C\]. In 2019, the EMA announced that mepolizumab is under investigation for the treatment of the specific AAV disease EGPA \[D\]. As a result, this offers the first licensed therapy to the approximately 3,000 patients with EGPA in the UK \[C\]. In the same year, the FDA licensed mepolizumab as the first drug in the US to treat EGPA \[10; D\]. Furthermore, the avacopan programme has led to licensing applications and the availability of this novel treatment on a compassionate basis \[9\]. 

 <ins> **Impact on practitioners and the delivery of professional services**</ins> 

 **Establishment of national policy and guidelines:** The January 2015 NHS Clinical Commissioning Policy, *Rituximab for the treatment of AAV in adults* \[E\], was directly informed and shaped by Cambridge\-led research \[6\]. The Policy ensures the equitable and cost\-effective use of rituximab as a treatment for AAV, both as a remission\-induction and maintenance agent. 

 Cambridge researchers also contributed significantly to the writing of the 2014 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) accredited British *Guideline for the management of adults with AAV* \[E\], and the first international *Recommendations for the management of ANCA\-associated vasculitis* \(2016, European League Against Rheumatism \[EULAR\]\) \[E\]. Cambridge\-led research into rituximab has produced the first recommendations specifically formulated for B cell targeted therapies in autoimmune rheumatic diseases. The 2018 recommendations aid healthcare professionals with clinical decision\-making in order to minimise infection risks for patients with drug induced immune deficiency \[E\]. 

 NICE also drew on Cambridge research \[6\] to shape its March 2014 Guideline, *Rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids for treating AAV* \(TA308\) \[F\]. As a direct consequence, clinicians are now able to implement best practice efficiently within treatment centres where patients and clinicians benefit from a unified practice across the UK, reducing significantly the risk of low quality, ‘postcode lottery’ management experiences that have been typical among rare diseases. 

 **Networks, training and development:** Cambridge researchers have been instrumental in establishing both national and international research and training networks for healthcare professionals caring for patients with AAV. Jayne was the founder of EUVAS in 2011 and remains its President. EUVAS has over 200 members across Europe and Australasia, facilitating international collaboration and sharing best practice. The success of EUVAS has led to the founding of similar clinical trial networks across the globe. The Chair of the NHS England Clinical Reference Group for Specialised Rheumatology, and President of the British Society for Rheumatology, notes that through Jayne’s *“international leadership of clinical trials as President of EUVAS, his work has created the evidence base that has directly ‘paved the way’ for revolutionary new treatments for people living with Vasculitis”* \[G\]. 

 Additionally, Cambridge researchers run a number of training courses for clinicians, including the annual EUVAS Course for senior trainees, consultants and allied health professionals. Established in 2017, the Course has been well\-attended each year \(720 attendees to date\), and has received positive feedback: in its first year 92% of attendees stated they would implement their learning in clinical practice \[H\]. 

 The national vasculitis registry, UKIVAS, was established in 2012 with input from Cambridge researchers, and Cambridge is the highest recruiter to the registry \(over 950 patients at present\). UKIVAS ensures that clinicians, providers and commissioners working in the field of vasculitis have robust and meaningful data to inform decision\-making for vasculitis services and patients. 

 **Regional Vasculitis Service:** The Vasculitis and Lupus Service at Addenbrooke’s Hospital is a nationally eminent treatment centre for sufferers of AAV. Under the directorship of Jayne, the Service provides optimal AAV treatment based on Cambridge\-led research. Between 2015 and 2019, the service hosted \~4,500 outpatient appointments per year for \~1,000 patients \[I\]. 

 <ins> **Impacts on</ins> <ins></ins><ins>understanding,</ins> <ins></ins><ins>learning and</ins> <ins></ins><ins>participation**</ins> 

 **Patient engagement:** Jayne is a Medical Advisor to Vasculitis UK, the UK’s leading vasculitis charity. In this role, Jayne uses his expertise to support and inform patients about their disease and therapies. Jayne contributed to the Fertility and Vasculitis section of the Vasculitis UK *Route Map* \[J\], published in 2014, which serves as a guide to living with vasculitis. In acknowledging Cambridge’s pivotal role in patient and clinician education and engagement through its world\-leading service, Vasculitis UK stated: “ *the \[Cambridge\] clinic has become the UK’s institution of ultimate recourse for unusual & complex cases with secondary & tertiary referrals from around the UK*. *”* \[B\]. 

 <ins> **Impact on commerce and the economy**</ins> 

 **Healthcare savings for the NHS:** By decreasing relapse and improving the management of patients with AAV, Cambridge research has significantly reduced the financial burden on the NHS. Approximately 50% of AAV patients relapse within the five years of treatment, which is particularly costly to the NHS, through hospitalisation, additional treatment, and immunosuppression\-associated infection. Significant costs can accrue at relapse from further organ damage, particularly renal damage leading to costly renal replacement therapy \[K\]. Indeed, the estimated cost savings for the NHS resulting directly from Cambridge\-led introduction of rituximab therapy alone are GBP45,000,000 per year \(2018/2019\) \[K\]. In the US, healthcare savings are estimated at USD41,400 per major relapse \[K\]. 

 Cambridge research demonstrating that two 1g infusions of rituximab is as effective as four infusions of 375mg/m<sup>2</sup> at weekly intervals has also produced cost savings to the NHS in terms of reduced clinical activity \(50%\) and drug costs \(40%\) \[F\]. Rituximab also generates more quality\-adjusted life years \(QALY\) than cyclophosphamide; noted by the NICE Evidence Review group to produce an incremental cost\-effectiveness ratio of GBP6,006 per QALY gained \[F\]. 

 **Impact on industry and production:** Cambridge research has been a major contributor to the licensing of novel treatments for AAV. Since its FDA licensing of mepolizumab for the treatment of EGPA, GlaxoSmithKline \(GSK\) has reported a 23% increase in sales of mepolizumab in the USA \[L\]. 

 Chemocentryx Inc has recently invested USD100,000,000 to develop the novel therapy, avacopan. Jayne is providing scientific advice based on novel work from Cambridge \[7\]. The drug is now in a Phase III trial and is on a pathway to licensing with the EMA, with the FDA recently accepting the New Drug Application \(NDA\) for avacopan \[C and L; 8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Statistical methodology developed at The Open University is embedded in routine outbreak detection systems including *LabBase* at Public Health England, the *Signale* system at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and the *Signal Detection* tool at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The methods are also being used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA and Statistics Canada to estimate excess deaths during the COVID pandemic. They are implemented in a robust quasi\-Poisson regression model for early detection of aberrant disease counts. These methods contribute directly to the public health in several countries in Europe and in North America. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 As part of its public health remit, Public Health England \(PHE\) routinely collects information on infections identified at NHS laboratories in England, Wales and Northern Ireland \(Scotland has a separate system\). In a typical week, reports on several hundred different infection types may be obtained. These data form the basis of a regional and national surveillance network to identify outbreaks of infectious disease caused, for example, by contaminated food or water. An automated outbreak detection system automatically scans the data each week to check for aberrances in the numbers of reports for particular infectious organisms. This automated outbreak detection system is the focus of this impact case study. 

 The system was developed at the Open University \(OU\) as part of a research programme undertaken in 2009 – 2015, in collaboration with PHE \(who supplied the data\), and led by **Farrington**, who maintains an active link with the OU as Emeritus Professor. 

 The key feature of the system that distinguishes it from other outbreak detection algorithms is that it provides early warnings of potential outbreaks across all possible infections surveyed, the number of which may run into hundreds or thousands. To this end, the system operates automatically, requiring no manual input, and is sufficiently robust to cope with the widely diverse features of the many different organism types that may be reported each week, notably their different frequency, seasonality, trend structure and intrinsic variability. 

 The outbreak detection algorithm developed at the OU **\[O2\]** is based on a quasi\-Poisson regression model, which compares the current weekly count for each organism type reported with its expected value, adjusted for seasonal variation, trends, and past outbreaks. The output includes a list of potential problem organisms, ranked by their degree of aberrance. 

 The statistical and operational assumptions underlying the algorithm have been thoroughly validated on real surveillance data **\[O1,** **O5\]**. Further methodological developments to explore aspects of the system and, potentially, extend its range of application have been undertaken. Thus, the time delay between collection of the specimen for analysis and its identification was investigated **\[O3\]** as were methods for adjusting for such delays **\[O4\]**. Also, the relationship between the mean, variance, and skewness of weekly counts for different organisms was studied both empirically **\[O1\]** and more theoretically **\[O6\]** across the range of organism types.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impacts described relate to use of OU research by five distinct public health or governmental agencies: Public Health England, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control \(an agency of the EU, operating across EU and EEA countries\), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA, and Statistics Canada. 

 **Impact 1: The Public Health England outbreak detection system** 

 In the UK, the control of infectious disease outbreaks is an important public health priority to which substantial resources are committed. For example, in 2018\-19 Public Health England \(PHE\) devoted GBP86,900,000 and 2093 staff to this task through its national centres and regional network and responded to over 10,000 outbreaks **\[C1** pp 11 and 14 **\]**. 

 The outbreak detection algorithm was developed at the OU in consultation with PHE statisticians and has been in use at PHE nationally and at its regional centres since 2013. A key function of the outbreak detection system is as a last line of defence, to identify outbreaks that have been missed at the local or regional level, through routine automated screening of all the available data. The system previously in use produced too many false alerts, resulting in an unnecessary burden of signal verification **\[C2** p379 para 2 **\]**. 

 The new exceedance monitoring system forms an integral part of PHE’s outbreak surveillance strategy **\[C3** p2 para 1 **\]**. The algorithm runs automatically every week to flag up possible outbreaks, which are then reviewed by a team of epidemiologists. The new system has led to the detection of numerous infectious disease outbreaks. For example, an outbreak of dysentery among the English Orthodox Jewish community was first flagged by the outbreak detection system in North London in December 2013 **\[C4** p2 para 3 **\]**. There were 52 cases; the outbreak was later linked to travel from an endemic area, indicating that public health advice to travellers may need to be reinforced to reduce imported infections **\[C4** Abstract **\]**. 

 **Impact 2: The Robert Koch Institute outbreak detection system** 

 The Robert Koch Institute \(RKI\), based in Berlin, is Germany’s federal Public Health Institute. Among its tasks it lists in first place the “ *Identification, surveillance and prevention of diseases, especially infectious diseases*”. To support this key strategic aim, RKI have developed a comprehensive online surveillance system called *Signale.* The outbreak detection component of this system uses the algorithm developed at the OU **\[C5** p3 para 2 **\]**. A senior infectious disease epidemiologist at RKI writes **\[C6**; our emphasis **\]**: 

 “*One of RKI’s core competencies is infectious disease epidemiology, and for this purpose we record and analyse data on the occurrence of numerous infectious diseases in Germany. A key component of this function is the Signale early warning system.* 

 *The Signale system provides epidemiologists in Germany with early alerts of possible outbreaks of infectious diseases. Its aim is to flag up infectious diseases that register an unusually high number of reports, compared to the number expected. **One of the statistical algorithms used to perform the calculations is that published in 2013 by Noufaily A., Enki DG, Farrington P et al in the journal Statistics in Medicine \(vol 32, pp 1206\-1222\). This algorithm was selected as it is appropriate for this application in view of its robustness and flexibility. \[**Note: the reference is **O2\]**.* 

 *The Signale early warning system was developed in 2015 and runs weekly. Reports of possible alerts are provided to epidemiologists in Public Health agencies throughout Germany. A key function of the Signale system is to provide reassurance that major outbreaks have not been missed, notably outbreaks of food\-borne infections. Also, in case of other available information, e.g. alerts about detection of special pathogens in food items, the Signale system is used to evaluate the epidemiological situation. It is especially useful for the analysis of the notification data for salmonellosis because we do not have the capacity to check all the combinations of different serotypes, locations and time periods manually*”. 

 **Impact 3: The ECDC outbreak detection system** 

 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control \(ECDC\), based in Stockholm, is an agency of the EU whose aim is to strengthen Europe’s defences against infectious diseases. In 2018, ECDC adopted the outbreak surveillance system developed at the OU and incorporated it into its routine surveillance tools. The Chief Scientific Officer at ECDC, writes **\[C7**; our emphasis **\]**: 

 “*Our long\-term strategy includes encouraging the development of strong, harmonised and efficient European surveillance systems to serve the member states, the European Commission and public health professionals. As part of this strategy, ECDC recently developed an Epidemiological Signal Detection package which is specifically designed to detect possible outbreaks at EU or country level, using infectious disease surveillance data retrieved from the European Surveillance System. Such outbreak detection systems are already in use at national level in some member states; they are applied in conjunction with other surveillance methods to provide early warnings of potential outbreaks. **One of the two detection algorithms included in the Signal Detection tool at the heart of the package is that developed by Farrington and colleagues at The Open University and Public Health England, and published as Noufaily et al \(2013\) in Statistics in Medicine \(vol 32, pp 1206\-22\).** We chose this algorithm because it is a validated and robust method that can detect the emergence of very rare infections, as well as outbreaks of more common infections, and has proved to be a popular choice with public health professionals \[…\]. The package has been well received and will help to harmonise Europe’s infectious disease surveillance systems in line with ECDC’s strategic objectives*” **\[**Note: the reference is **O2\]**. 

 The Signal Detection Tool was developed at ECDC as an R package incorporating the OU algorithm, which is freely available online from the ECDC website. The purpose of the package is described in the following terms **\[C8** p2 Background **\]**: 

 “*The monitoring of routinely collected infectious disease surveillance data has the potential to ensure that relevant changes in disease incidence such as possible outbreaks are promptly recognised, investigated and that control measures are initiated in a timely manner. Due to the large amount of data being collected as part of such surveillance, there is a need to develop automatic detection algorithms, which can assist epidemiologists in this task*”. 

 **Impact 4: Monitoring excess mortality during the COVID pandemic** 

 Since the start of the COVID\-19 pandemic, the OU outbreak detection algorithm has been adapted to estimate excess mortality \(the most reliable measure of deaths attributable to this coronavirus\) in the USA and Canada. 

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\), the main public health agency responsible for surveillance of infectious diseases in the USA, describe the methodology underpinning their system for monitoring excess mortality in the following terms **\[C9** Technical Notes para 1 **\]**: 

 “*Counts of deaths in the most recent weeks were compared with historical trends \(from 2013 to present\) to determine whether the number of deaths in recent weeks was significantly higher than expected, using **Farrington** surveillance algorithms \( **Noufaily** 2013\)*” **\[**Note: the reference is **O2\]**. 

 Likewise, the OU algorithm was used by Statistics Canada, that country’s national statistics agency, to monitor excess mortality during the COVID\-19 pandemic. Their methods are briefly described as follows **\[C10** p7 para 1 **\]**: 

 *“The model used to estimate the expected number of deaths is adapted from an infectious disease detection algorithm developed by **Farrington** et al. and modified by **Noufaily** et al. and Salmon et al.”* **\[**Note: these last two references are **O2** and **C5\]**. 

 **In conclusion** 

 The statistical outbreak detection methodology developed at the OU has had wide\-ranging impact on systems designed to protect the public health, both within the UK and in other countries. In addition to its intended use for outbreak detection, the methodology has proved to be versatile and of wider significance, as shown by its use to monitor excess mortality during the COVID\-19 pandemic.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Manchester \(UoM\) researchers developed an early childhood intervention, representing a paradigm shift by working directly through parents rather than exclusively with the child. It is the first treatment to have achieved sustained improvement in autism symptom severity before and after diagnosis and with improved parental well\-being. Over 600 professionals in more than 21 countries have been trained to date and >80% with actual or planned implementation with multiple families. It has influenced policy guidance internationally and has been adapted and evidenced for low and medium income country settings. International survey evidence shows high acceptability, implementation and effectiveness. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Autism is an enduring condition affecting over 1% of people worldwide \(approximately 190,000,000 children\), but without effective therapy to reduce its symptoms. UoM research 2000\-2020 led a **treatment discovery and translational programme of innovative autism treatment**. From 2000, a UoM pre\-school autism intervention, based on developmental theory showed promise in pilot work \[1\]. MRC awards \(Green as CI, Leadbitter, Aldred, and Taylor in the team\) from 2006 allowed further development and testing of this Paediatric Autism Communication Therapy \(PACT\) in a UK consortium including Newcastle University, Kings College and Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital, London. The three site \(Manchester, London, Newcastle\) MRC PACT trial, the largest then undertaken in autism, led to two Lancet publications \[2,3\], reporting a **significant reduction in autism symptom severity for the first time**, sustained for six years after the end of therapy. At the start of treatment, 50% of the controls and 55% of those in PACT intervention were severely autistic; at follow\-up, the proportion was 63% in the control group but 46% in the PACT group. Publications on Health Economics, measurement, parent mental health and well\-being related to PACT treatment have followed; further NIHR/MRC Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation programme trial of extension of PACT into schools is ongoing. 

 From 2006\-12, Pickles, Emsley and Green were part of two MRC methodology programmes developing analyses of causal inference and mediation in trials of complex interventions in mental health; methods were applied to the PACT trial, in the first **mechanism analysis in autism intervention** \[4\], which demonstrated the mechanism of action of the treatment through parents in a way that supported its theoretical rationale and provided a platform for refinement and adaptation of the therapy for other settings. 

 The ‘prodromal’ period before autism emerges from two to three years of age is an important target for **prevention therapy**. Leading another national consortium from 2012, Green developed a related briefer treatment method, building on new infancy developmental science from UoM and Birkbeck, London, to target these early prodromal processes in 9 months old infants at high familial risk of autism. The findings \[5\] mirrored PACT, showing for the first time that a prevention intervention in autism could modify the severity of emergent autism symptom trajectories over three years. This work is currently being reproduced in Australia. 

  

 **Global health** With approximately 1% prevalence across the world, most autistic children live in the global south \(approximately 6,000,000 in India alone\) and have no access to evidenced therapy. In 2012, Green’s group partnered with colleagues in South Asia to adapt and test the PACT intervention in low and middle income settings; the first time an evidenced autism treatment had been systematically adapted in this way. This collaboration showed \[6\] that this technical intervention could be successfully delivered by non\-specialist workers in remote settings, with treatment fidelity and proximal outcomes equivalent to UK trials. Green is now leading a large MRC/Wellcome/Department for International Development Joint Global Health Trial of this approach at scale in India.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 Autism is a priority condition worldwide because of its >1% prevalence and enduring societal impact; estimated UK health and societal costs \(GBP32,000,000,000 per annum\) exceed those of stroke, heart disease and cancer combined. The UK’s autism research charity Autistica states *“PACT is the only well\-evidenced therapy that has the potential to improve a child’s social communication skills in a sustained way as they develop and therefore alter their longer\-term trajectory in life*” \[A\]. 

##  Pathways to Impact 

 Following publication in leading scientific journals, including two Lancet papers, NIHR ‘Signal Study’ status \[B\], and global media interest, international professionals have responded with replication and extension plans. In 2017, Green formed a spin\-out not for profit community interest company from the University \(IMPACT; Community Interest Company \(CiC\) No 10902031\) to formalise PACT training and support world\-wide implementation; a systematic survey of its impact is below. The work has been referenced in national and international treatment guidance documents \(see \(iv\) below\). Funded implementation trials internationally have involved over 1,300 families and ongoing testing of an online remote PACT delivery increases dissemination. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

 **\(i\) Benefits to people with autism and their families  \[C\]. The PACT therapy works with parents using structured video\-feedback techniques to help them recognize better their autistic child’s altered communication. Working through parents rather than with the child \(the traditional approach\), is efficient of therapist time, empowers parents with enhanced skills, embeds the work into family life, improves family self\-care and resilience and creates sustained change in child symptoms \[C,3\]. International survey of PACT training \(2020, n=332\) \[D\], found strong parental endorsement of relevance and acceptability \(median 6/7; 1= ‘strongly disagree’, 7=’strongly agree’\), therapeutic improvement for child \(5.8/7\), feasibility in everyday life \(6/7\) and family wellbeing \(6.5/7\). 

 Parent reports on the experience of receiving PACT therapy were evaluated through independently conducted interviews \[D\]: *“I put my eyes behind \[child’s name\]’ eyes and I just imagine for a minute that I am in \[child’s name\]’s little head and try to look at it from his angle…and you probably react totally different to the way you would initially react, because you have looked at it from his point of view”; “We are so pleased with the progress he’s made, it has been fantastic. I think the PACT trial was huge, it was hugely important to him. And it was hugely important for the whole family, it is kind of a family confidence it gave the whole family really”; “And my husband, my family all suddenly saw \[child’s name\] as opposed to the autism”.* 

 **\(ii\) Community health impact.** PACT implementation has been in close collaboration with families and service users. The team co\-developed \[E\] the first user\-nominated measure of treatment outcome in autism now being used by 23 clinical teams in 15 countries and 12 languages and in three other major research trials \(262 discussion tweets reaching 398,000 people internationally\). A UK trial of education adaptation has involved 200 schools and nurseries; treating 120 children and skilling up an equivalent number of teaching assistants for application to other pupils. It has attracted investment from Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership of GBP100,000 for a Greater Manchester\-wide implementation. 

 **\(iii\) Global education and training for healthcare professionals.  IMPACT CiC has trained over 600 new professionals from 21 countries to date; 60% responded to a 2020 survey \[D\]: >70% had used the training and >60% had already implemented the therapy with a median of four families and another 19% intend to shortly. Professionals rated high PACT relevance and acceptability with median score 6.7/7 \(n=110\) reflecting improvements in how they communicate with a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder and in how they can aid parents to more empowerment. 

 **\(iv\) International guidelines and changes to practice.  Based on PACT research and one other US group, the NICE Clinical Guideline 170 on 'Autism spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management' \(NICE August 2013\) \[F\] issued a 'consider' recommendation for early 'social communication' intervention, working through carers or teachers, for the core symptoms of autism; the only treatment approach so advocated. Internationally, Belgium included the same evidence and recommendation \[G\] and it is now known that upcoming French national guidance for autism will recommend PACT intervention. PACT was highlighted as one of the few evidenced treatments for autism in the 2017 UK ‘National Autism Project’ \[H\], the 2020 UK Parliament POSTNOTE on Autism \[I\], plus nominated treatment for autism symptoms in the DH 'Improving Access to Psychological Treatment' \(IAPT\) curriculum for Autism and Learning Disability. The UK research charity Autistica’s independent evidence summary on PACT for NHS providers, commissioners and professionals recommends the national implementation of PACT \[A\]. 

 **\(v\) Global impact including in low and medium income countries.  The PACT therapy has been adapted for use in low and medium income countries to be delivered by non\-specialists \[4\] and a large scale up trial is underway within the Indian health system, with potential to reach the estimated 6,000,000 children with autism in that country. Further implementation studies are planned or underway in US, Australia, Hong Kong, China, Brazil, Denmark, France \[J\]. Progress to date was evidenced in the first IMPACT international symposium in 2020 \[J\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The mental health and wellbeing of professional athletes in general and, in particular, sports which emphasize ‘mental toughness’ and are considered to reinforce masculine stereotypes, has been highlighted as an area of concern. Research conducted at the University of Huddersfield has identified key areas of improvement in welfare support in elite\-level rugby league. As a result of the research, the Rugby Football League \(RFL\) made policy changes \(affecting all twelve Super League clubs across the UK, France and Canada\), which have markedly improved the service Player Welfare Managers \(PWMs\) can provide for players. Benefits include increased awareness, uptake and access to player welfare, and mental health benefits for both players and PWMs. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professional rugby players have traditionally had limited welfare support, with the majority of support directed towards improving on\-field support. However, professional rugby players are in a vulnerable position with short careers, uncertain contracts and a reluctance to seek help. Prevalence of anxiety and depression in male elite athletes in team sports is as high as 45% and rugby has been described as having a ‘toxic culture’ of denial of mental health problems. 

 The research, undertaken at the University of Huddersfield, was conducted between 2015\-2016 led by Dr Kiara Lewis in collaboration with Dr Susanna Kola\-Palmer and Dr Alison Rodriguez. The work was also supported by undergraduate and PhD students at the University. The team worked closely with the Player Welfare Director \(PWD\) in devising the study aims and objectives and she \(PWD\) was instrumental in feeding the results back to the RFL \[5.1\]. The research produced evidence on the needs, assets, deficits and future requirements of welfare support which was fed back to the RFL who then made substantial changes to policy and practice to change welfare provision across the sport. Specifically, the research has contributed in the following ways: 

1.  **Demonstrated to the RFL that the players’ attitudes and knowledge of the availability of mental health support is a significant independent correlate of their mental well\-being.** 

 Lewis, Kola\-Palmer and Rodriguez used an anonymous online survey of professional rugby players to assess their knowledge of and attitudes to RFL player welfare. The survey incorporated psychometrically sound, standardised measures of mental health, psychological stress and athletic identity as well as specific questions on the then current welfare provision to assess awareness \[3.2\]. In year one, 77 players completed the survey \(25%\), and in year two 169 players \(47%\) completed the survey. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time UK and French elite rugby football league players have been surveyed and levels of symptoms of mental health mapped and, it is also the first\-time elite athletes’ engagement with, knowledge of and attitudes to sport player welfare have been investigated. The relationship between more positive attitudes and knowledge of mental health support to better mental health, is a novel and important finding in RFL \[3.3\]. The results suggest that endeavours to increase positive attitudes and knowledge, and to reduce mental health stigma, may have real benefits in terms of increasing mental health. 

1.  **Emphasised that PWMs perceived they were unable to support all the players’ needs in the time available and felt under considerable pressure themselves with, at times, little support from clubs and coaches.** 

 A qualitative study using total purposive sampling was conducted with the PWMs, in total 11 of the 12 PWMs across the UK and France were interviewed in the first year and 12 of the 14 in the second year. The interviews that were conducted used an asset\-based approach to identify the assets, deficits and opportunities. The findings showed that PWMs perceived demands of the job were, for many, too high on a part\-time basis \(a majority of clubs had PWMs on 3 day a week contracts\) and in some cases was impacting on their own welfare. They felt that they were unable to provide all the welfare support needed and that they were being impeded from their job by a lack of support from the club and coaches \(without buy\-in from the coach, players would not engage\) \[3.1\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 A report was produced for the Rugby Football League \(RFL\) following each year of the study \[5.2/5.3\]. The reports were given to the Player Welfare Director \(PWD\) who took them to the RFL board, Chief Executive Officers and coaches at each club, and the Player Welfare and Education Forum which brings together key stakeholders in player welfare. The reports were therefore viewed by those with managerial and everyday responsibility for player welfare at all twelve Super League clubs \(with responsibility for approximately 400 players\). The research was deemed essential by the PWD for the changes in welfare provision to occur: “ *People are probably sick of hearing the University of Huddersfield Survey said, because I use it all the time, because it does just give the outside validation to something. It creates a greater impression; it’s much more difficult to be argued against when it’s done independently*” \[5.4\]. 

 The research led to the following benefits to the people involved in professional rugby league: 

1.  Increased support for the mental health of PWMs 

1.  Increased awareness of welfare support and more positive attitudes of players 

1.  Employment of full\-time PWMs through a change in RFL policy 

1.  More positive attitude of clubs towards welfare support 

 **1. Increased support for PWMs’ mental health \(Quality of Life impact\):** 

 One of the recommendations from the first report was that a support strategy was needed for PWMs as well as additional qualifications and training \[5.1\]. This was picked up by the RFL and thereafter PWMs were provided with a workshop by Sporting Chance \(who provide mental health support\) to help them in recognising signs of depression. The PWMs have also had to undergo formal supervision through Sporting Chance at least once a year. Additional sessions are now offered if the PWM has had to deal with a particularly traumatic event \[5.4\]. Following the second report the RFL agreed to continue to centrally fund Sporting Chance so their services are free to all players and PWMs who need them \[5.3\]. This has been recognised by PWMs as important in supporting their own mental health; when asked what impact the report had had on him personally one PWM replied “ *The bits of care for us as Welfare Managers has been good. So, the opportunity to speak to somebody from Sporting Chance has been valuable and I have done it a couple of times because we take on a lot, we do take a lot on ourselves, everyone dumps their problems on us at times*” \[5.5\]. 

 **2. Change in awareness and attitudes of players towards welfare \(in particular mental health\) support \(cultural impact\):** 

 The first report recommended that the RFL needs to further reinforce and communicate the importance of player welfare priorities, and players should be made aware of welfare policy and know who their player welfare manager is \[5.2\]. Following the release of the report all players \(currently over 400 players across twelve clubs in UK, France\) were provided with a booklet outlining the player welfare provisions that are available to them. PWMs were encouraged to present to all players at the start of the season and to hold a social occasion for players’ parents and partners to explain the provision that is in place \[5.6\]. 

 The results of the second survey showed that player awareness had improved: 75% of players \(compared with 69% in 2015\) now know their club has a welfare policy and 78% \(compared with 58% in 2015\) know how to access mental health support \[5.3\]. This is supported by player X “ *I wasn’t aware of all the support and the welfare that was around where I feel like \(PWM\) and the club make a conscious effort now and making everything clear of what you can get and help and everything*” \[5.7\]. 

 There are a number of other quotes from the second round of interviews \(following changes made following the first set of interviews\) with the PWMs. These illustrate the PWMs’ experience of the changes in awareness and attitudes of players as a result the research: 

 *“Players are now asking me types of questions which they weren’t asking a couple of years ago, do you know what I mean* \[Interviewer *: yeah*\] *. So yes, its busier, but its busy because a lot of it is now being driven by the lads asking questions as opposed to me having to go to them”* \[5.7\] 

 *“It’s \(Sporting Chance\) vital and again in that culture shift, now that one or two lads have had help and received help and know there’s help out there, it’s encouraging others to speak up”* \[5.7\] 

 Interviewer *: “do you think, has there been any change in the culture of whether or not players will seek help and seek advice?”*  Respondent *: “Yes, yes, because the more it becomes public, as long as it’s out there, the players have sought help and when players are going round doing presentations of, you know, sticking their hand up and saying ‘look, I had depression, I were an alcoholic, I had a gambling addiction’, that sends a message across then, that yeah, it all of a sudden becomes acceptable”* \[5.7\] 

 *“I think speaking as myself, as a former player, I think the cultural changes, the perception of Sporting Chance and the range of services they offer have certainly changed. As I say, it was, at first, it was oh he’s a drug addict, or he’s a gambler or he’s an alcoholic and its certainly not that. I think we really appreciate the vast array of services that they offer”* \[5.7\] 

 **3. Change in RFL policy to ensure all clubs employ a full time PWM \(Public Policy impact\):** 

 The second report \[5.3\], having found that PWMs were struggling with the demands of the job, recommended that the all Super League clubs should have a full\-time PWM \(the majority at this time were employed on 3 days per week contracts as the role was not considered to be as important as other club roles\). Following the recommendation, the RFL announced that all 12 Super League clubs would have a full time PWM \[5.9\]. Further revisions to the Player Welfare Policy included reference to ‘Athletic Identity’ \(as players whose identify was more closely linked to being a rugby player, rather than a husband, parent etc., were at greater risk\), an increase in career 1\-2\-1s, and a more structured policy of targeting ‘hard to reach’ players \[5.10\]. The move to full\-time has been recognised by the PWMs as the most important change for them.  “ *For us, I suppose one of the main things that came out of it \(the research\) was clubs moving to full time provision*” \[5.5\] and how that benefits players “ *the biggest benefit to me of it being full time is the time that I have to spend with players, without any other responsibilities*” \[5.5\], they go on to explain it can benefit both players’ mental health and performance “ *I feel if you get the welfare provision right at the club, there is a, there is added benefits actually from the performance point of view as well*” \[5.5\]. 

 **4. Change in attitude of clubs towards welfare support \(Social Impact\):** 

 In the first report the high risk of depression of players was highlighted. Having received this information there were changes in practices to make player’s mental health more prominent. This is supported through correspondence with the PWD \[5.6\] “ *Information on depression has now meant we have a more strategic way of “screening” the lads every morning. This means there are daily well\-being surveys but also a 6 weekly mental health questionnaire to try and pick up on any signs*” \[5.6\] 

 The RFL Player Welfare Policy has been revised to follow a holistic personal development model. Workshops included time management, mindfulness etc. Our research is referenced in the policy guidance \[5.10\] and attracted lots of media coverage \(over 15 articles in local, regional, national and international news outlets\). 

 This change has been seen from all areas of the RFL structure as described by a PWM: 

 *“I would think more so in the last sort of eighteen months, I think, he’s \(CEO\) coming to understand that the role \(PWM\) is a necessity within the Clubs and I think that, you know, I’m actually benefitting from that*” \[5.8\]. 

 As a Canadian club has now entered the Super League the policy and practical changes are being implemented across all clubs in the UK, France and Canada.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Professor Humphrey Southall has pioneered the creation of accessible and searchable digital web databases that reflect how places have changed with time. These have been used directly by national and international libraries to improve access to their archives and collections and to extend their services. Data from ‘GB1900’, the world’s largest historical gazetteer, has been included in national regulation to preserve Welsh naming of properties and streets and in the identification of 49,000 miles of missing rights of way in England and Wales. These projects, and volunteer engagement with citizen geography, have enhanced cultural understanding and awareness of cultural heritage. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Gazetteers organise knowledge and details about named places; used with maps or an atlas, they link geographical names with spatial co\-ordinates. Digital gazetteers act as bridges between formal geographic information science \(GIS\) \(the geospatial web\) and the use of placenames in informal discourse \(the semantic web\). Gazetteer‐based services are applied in fields such as public health, natural history data management and cultural history, but their value is frequently limited by the need to know about places whose locations may be uncertain or whose names may have evolved over time. 

 Between 2001 and 2004, **Professor Humphrey** **Southall** led the rebuilding of the Great Britain Historical GIS \(GBHGIS\) to address these issues \( **G1**\). The GBHGIS is a spatially enabled database that documents and visualises the changing human geography of the British Isles over the last 200 years. The new architecture developed by **Southall** organised complex information around named entities and explicit spatial relationships to link legally defined administrative areas and statistical reporting units with a less formal geography of ‘places’ contained in old maps, descriptive gazetteers and a library of travel writing \( **R1**\). Launched in 2004 as ‘ [A Vision of Britain through Time’](https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/), this rich gazetteer not only mapped changes to administrative boundaries but also presented a range of approaches to searching for, and accessing, information from diverse historical sources linked to a geographical location. 

 Through ‘A Vision of Britain through Time’, **Southall** established digital gazetteers as a central research focus in the digital humanities and became a recognised leader in the spatial humanities. In April 2011, **Southall** organised a workshop on Gazetteer Construction at the Association of American Geographers meeting, Seattle, which considered the extent to which existing gazetteers and gazetteer standards adequately reflected the historical, textual, cultural, and multivalent character of past places \( **R2**\). The Seattle workshop led directly to the *Placing Names* book \( **R3**\) and led Southall to conclude: \(i\) that future historical gazetteers should be based on “attested place names”, i.e. particular text strings being used to refer to a place in a specific, and usually dated, source; and \(ii\) that crowd\-sourcing was the most cost effective and pragmatic way to harvest this information on the necessary scale. In May 2011, at a meeting at the National Library of Wales \(NLW\) on how best to advance a systematic survey of Welsh place names, **Southall** contributed his significant experience with Vision of Britain of combining maps at different scales and proposed crowd\-sourcing from historical 6 inch maps. This meeting led directly to ‘Cymru 1900’, a uniquely crowdsourced Welsh historical place name gazetteer, developed by a consortium of Welsh agencies and launched in October 2013 \( **R3**\). 

 In 2015, **Southall** led the Great Britain Historical GIS team \( **Aucott**, **Stoner**\) at the University of Portsmouth on the ‘GB1900’ project. Project partners included the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\) and the NLW. ‘GB1900’ re\-located ‘Cymru 1900’ to a Portsmouth server, where the software was revised to improve the transcription process and enable volunteers to computerise all the place names and other text on mapping provided by the NLS and covering the whole of Great Britain. ‘GB1900’ crowd\-sourcing ran from September 2016 to January 2018 and the final dataset, consisting of 2.55 million coordinates and text strings, was launched under a Creative Commons license in July 2018:  [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data/\#tabgb1900](http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data/). ‘GB1900’ is the largest historical gazetteer in the world, providing a detailed textual description of Britain around 1900 and enabling diverse geo\-semantic analyses of Britain's historic environments \( **R4**, **R5**\). 

 Finally, since 1990, hundreds of thousands of historical maps held in map library collections worldwide had been made viewable online. However, they remained difficult to find; users needed to know which libraries to search, and library search interfaces generally required knowledge of map titles. In October 2011, **Southall** led the Old Maps Online \(OMO\) project \( **G2**\). Working with an innovative software company, Klokan Technologies Gmbh, OMO gathered detailed metadata about over 100,000 online historical maps to create an open access digital repository that could be searched by either ‘name attestation’ or geo\-reference \( **R6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Improving access to historical information held by national and international libraries** 

 **Over the last 20 years, Southall has delivered his pioneering vision for digital gazetteers, based on a deep understanding of how to link maps with searchable databases working on text. This has changed the way in which national and international libraries think about their geographical resources and prompted them to reconsider how geographical content within their collections can be discovered and searched. For example, Southall’s GBHGIS and ‘Vision of Britain’ projects \(R1\) made information on changes to administrative boundaries available in an accessible form as GIS Shape files \(see**  [Vision of Britain Data Access](https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data/) **\)** to the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\). The NLS is one of **Europe’s major research libraries and holds one of the largest map libraries in the world. Access to this boundary data enabled the NLS to create a map of the boundaries of parishes, counties and unitary authorities in Scotland**. Launched in December 2017, the NLS  [*Boundaries Viewer*](https://maps.nls.uk/geo/boundaries/) has seen over 63,000 page views, with users on average spending 2 minutes, 19 seconds on the site. **Similarly, in April 2018, the NLS used ‘GB1900’ data to create a searchable place\-name index,**  [maps.nls.uk/geo/find](https://maps.nls.uk/geo/find/), **for its online map collection that improved the indexing and retrieval of NLS maps by allowing people to search for historic names, gathered on maps from a century ago. ‘ **For many of our users, this is a huge step forward, unlocking some of the rich content of our scanned historical maps, as the names on them often do not appear in standard modern gazetteers**’ \(S1\). The ‘GB1900’ gazetteer is also available in NLS’s**  [Explore Georeferenced Maps Viewer](https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/) **, which receives over 3.2 million page views per year, with users on average spending 4 minutes, 12 seconds on the site. ‘ **These innovations have improved indexing and retrieval of NLS resources and enabled the NLS to expand the services it offers its users. These have raised the reputation and visibility of our Library and** **online maps, and allowed us to reach new communities and audiences’** \(S1\).** 

 **The Old Maps Online \(OMO\) project, led by Southall \(G2, R6\), created the broadest single virtual collection of historical maps in the world \(** [http://www.oldmapsonline.org/](http://www.oldmapsonline.org/) **\). This included contributions from 20 national and international libraries, including the British Library,** **the National Library of Wales, the NLS, the Dutch National Archives, the Moravian Library in the Czech Republic, the Biblioteca Nacional de Colombia in Bogota, the David Rumsey Collection in California, Harvard University and the New York Public Library. Using metadata in a prescribed format, OMO enables people to find a map of a specific location in a collection, without having to search for an individual map sheet by name or to know which library held the map and go to their website/database to find it. OMO, therefore, provided a simple and intuitive way for thousands of people to access old maps and map collections, whilst allowing map libraries to retain control of their collections and the way in which maps are viewed, accessed, copied etc. In doing so, it has supported national and international libraries to** **improve access to their unique collections, services and expertise**. In 2020, the NLS received 11,868 direct referrals \(5.86% of their user acquisitions\) from Old Maps Online \( **S1**\). 

 **Engagement with public – enhanced cultural understanding** 

 The ‘GB1900’ project \( **R4, R5**\) pioneered the geographical application of ‘citizen science’, working with volunteer transcribers. Between September 2016 and January 2018, ‘GB1900’ recruited over 1,000 online volunteers, and the ten most active volunteers each worked the equivalent of six full\-time months. An evaluation of ‘GB1900’ volunteer motivations identified that, unlike volunteers in physical science ‘citizen science’ projects, motivation was linked to personal interest in the maps, in places that held meaning for them, and in how places had changed \( **S2**\). In particular, the names of places unlocked the social and linguistic history of the land, recalling local industries, changed landscapes and preserving a rich heritage of Welsh\- and Gaelic\-language forms from across Wales and Scotland. Volunteers tended to start transcribing in places that were known to them, but then moved to other areas, **deriving great pleasure from learning about new areas and about cultural aspects that they were previously unaware of**. For example, volunteers reported: ‘ *As soon as we started working in Scotland, I became fascinated about how many things there were to do with water supply... and how much industry across the central belt had died off already by the late 1890s. It was extraordinarily interesting to uncover that’* \(Volunteer 7734\); ‘ *I found the link between Welsh and Gaelic interesting. I didn’t realise there was so much overlap’* \(Volunteer 7725\); and ‘ *You don’t know what you’re going to come across next, an interesting place or an historic aspect… so many trains, even under construction, but no airfields. I was constantly amazed… I think I have had a blinkered past where history is concerned…’* \(Volunteer 8094\) \( **S3**\). Since its launch in June 2018, there have been a total of 1,044 data downloads from the ‘GB1900’ site by people with a wide variety of interests. These include: for personal research by local history organisations or individuals interested in their family history \(56%\); for academic or professional research \(31%\); and downloads from individuals working in libraries, archives and across the public, private and voluntary sectors. 

 **Preservation of culture, history and rights connected to place** 

1.  **Preserving Welsh Historic Place Names** 

 In October 2013, a consortium of Welsh agencies, the People’s Collection of Wales, University of Wales’ Centre for Advanced Welsh & Celtic Studies, National Library of Wales and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales \(RCAHMW\), together with the citizen science platform, Zooniverse, launched ‘ [Cymru1900](https://historicplacenames.rcahmw.gov.uk/blog/our-data-sources-the-cymru1900-project)’. Between 2013 and 2015, using historical Ordnance Survey maps of Wales, online volunteers recorded and geo\-located over 294,000 transcriptions of text, i.e. the names of towns, villages, woods, farms, rivers and dwellings. In 2015 and led by **Southall**, ‘Cymru 1900’ was scaled up into ‘GB1900’: higher quality map scans and an enhanced interface enabled volunteers to verify place names, and to identify and include additional Welsh place names \( **R4, S4**\).  Recognising the importance of historic place names to the history and culture of Wales, the Welsh Government included a provision for a statutory list of historic place names in the Historic Environment \(Wales\) Act 2016. **In May 2017, the RCAHMW created the**  [**List of Historic Place Names of Wales**](http://www.senedd.assembly.wales/documents/s95024/RCAHMW%20paper.pdf) **: this contains 675,000 names of which 43% were contributed by ‘Cymru1900’ and ‘GB1900’. This List has:** 

-  **raised public awareness of the rich legacy of historic place in Wales: in one month alone \(September 2019\), 5,450 public users conducted 6,642 sessions on the website \(S5\);** 

-  **informed decisions on the management of the historic environment. Incorporation of the List into the 2016 Act mandated that local authority Planning and Street Naming and Numbering departments must use the List to review development proposals and recommend the use of Welsh names on properties and streets. Local Councils have readily complied \(see, for example, instructions on property naming by**  [Ceredigion](https://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/resident/planning-building-control-and-sustainable-drainage-body-sab/planning-building-control/street-naming-and-numbering/) **,**  [Powys](https://en.powys.gov.uk/article/5948/Register-a-new-property--street-name) **and**  [Gwynedd](https://www.gwynedd.llyw.cymru/en/Residents/Planning-and-building-control/Propertynaming.aspx) **Councils\) and**  [Ceredigion Council](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/857894/property-names-wales-homeowners-english-ceredigion) **specifically encourages homeowners applying to rename properties to retain historical Welsh names, even if the new suggested name is also in Welsh.** 

1.  **Extending Britain’s footpath network** 

 Walking is the most popular recreational activity in the UK, with over 20 million adults in England walking for leisure each year \( [Sport England, October 2020](https://sportengland-production-files.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2020-10/Active%20Lives%20Adult%20May%2019-20%20Report.pdf?AYzBswpBmlh9cNcH8TFctPI38v4Ok2JD)\). Such mass activity is only possible through an extensive network of rights of way across the country. In 2000, the UK government set a deadline of 1 January 2026 for all historic paths to be registered for inclusion on official maps; non\-registration will mean that the rights of way will be lost forever. Southall recognised the value of the ‘GB1900’ data in this context, based as it is on computerised, historical maps of England and Wales and including over 300,000 footpath \(F.P.\) and 15,000 bridle road \(B.R.\) markers, and contacted the Ramblers Association \(RA\) in 2018. Southall provided the RA with access to the ‘GB1900’ data, as well as his experience of running a crowd\-sourced mapping activity. The RA launched a ‘citizen geography’ campaign, ‘ [*Don’t Lose Your Way*](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/get-involved/campaign-with-us/dont-lose-your-way-2026.aspx)’ \(DLYW\) in January 2020. DLYW used an online platform that combined the ‘GB1900’ data, historical maps of England and Wales from the NLS, and current Ordnance Survey maps. Members of the RA and the public were asked to compare the historic and modern maps, paying particular attention to F.P. and B.R. markers from the ‘GB1900’ data, and to use these abbreviations to build a more detailed vector layer, showing the actual routes of the footpaths and identifying paths that were missing from the modern rights of way network. 

 The DLYW campaign was launched in February 2020 and attracted 260 pieces of press coverage, with a total circulation of 52,641,646, and over 2,000,000 impressions on social media. It was covered by national newspapers \(Daily Mail, Times, Guardian\), magazines \(Country Living, Waitrose\) and TV and Radio \(BBC Breakfast, Sky News, Radio 4\), supported by the National Trust and Cycling UK and endorsed by high profile environmental campaigners, such as Chris Packham, CBE. Over a 6\-week period, a total of 154,298 1km<sup>2</sup>  squares of England and Wales were reviewed \(each square reviewed twice\) by 3,447 volunteers. *‘This \(response\)... has shown us that this issue isn’t just of interest to Ramblers members, it inspires people far more widely. It’s about becoming a detective, delving into history to reclaim a right of way and safeguard it for generations’* \(DLYW Programme Manager, **S6**\). As well as being individually useful as evidence of an historic right of way, the F.P. and B.R. markers from ‘GB1900’ helped to identify areas where previous path registration was particularly inadequate, enabling the DLYW project to better target resources for further investigation. 

 **As a result of DLYW, more than 49,000 miles of potentially missing rights of way have been identified**, nearly five times the original estimate. According to the DLYW Programme Manager, *‘The F.P. and B.R. markers from the GB1900 project were a central element of our criteria for identifying potential lost rights of way and, without them, I am sure we would have overlooked many of these lost paths’* \( **S7**\). Further work is now underway to collate documentary evidence of these missing rights of way and to lodge applications with local authorities. **If reinstated, these will increase the path network in England and Wales by 30%.**

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The creation, distribution and consumption of creative goods has been transformed by the digital era, raising new questions of the interpretation and application of copyright law. Should consumers, for example, be able to copy bought music onto their computer \(known as the private right of copying\)? Or, should musicians be legally able to parody others \(parody exception\)? Issues like these create a conflict between the legal framing of Intellectual Property \(IP\), where IP is a natural, given right \(labour theory\) and the economic framing of IP, where IP is a policy mechanism to incentivise innovation \(social contract theory\). The rigid structure of copyright \(and its economic justification\), argues Searle, is at odds with what motivates innovators and it highlights the intrinsic tension between artistic integrity and the commercial market \[R1\]. Dr. Nicola Searle’s nuanced take on the economic theory of IP bridges different frameworks used in policy and industry through an interdisciplinary approach that draws together economics, management techniques, collaborations with sociologists and a deep understanding of IP law. 

 Searle critiques the traditional economic \(neo\-classical\) framing, one that undervalues the distribution of financial and non\-financial impacts of CI policies, and highlights the importance of social contexts, such as the cultural capital of the Creative Industry \(CI\) \[G1, G2\]. In *Creating Economy* \(2019\), co\-authored with sociologists Townley and Roscoe, Searle presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of creators’ complex relationship with IP. Based on 122 interviews with creators in multiple creative fields, the book highlights bias in current economic analysis and questions the incentive\-to\-innovate assumption that is central to economic justifications of IP policy \[R1\]. 

 To improve the system, IP policy\-makers need to create new IP laws and practices that benefit creators, and by extension, consumers. Investigating the economic analysis of intangible assets \(copyright\) in the CI sector, where value and quantitative assessments are complex, Searle critiques existing IP policy narratives, demonstrating that economic analysis of IP is frequently applied inconsistently or blocked entirely to the detriment of new evidence\-based policy \[R2, R3, R4, R5\]. Furthermore, in a meta\-analysis of 80 CI business models in 2016\-17 \(CREATe, \[G2\]\), Searle concludes that, despite changes brought about by the digital era, IP policy debate remains remarkably stable. She finds that vested interests in the CI inhibit IP policy reform, and that the CI continually lobby to support existing models, which benefit incumbents, at the expense of effecting more profound changes \[G2, R4\]. 

 Until recently, economics has been noticeably absent in IP policymaking, but Searle’s research demonstrates and expands the vital contribution of economic analysis to the field and its potential uses; 

 1\) in industry, where decision making situations have been thwarted because of the way economics and law is interpreted \(e.g. black\-letter law approaches\) \[R2\]; 

 2\) in IP policymaking and law, which suffers from regulatory capture, having been dictated almost exclusively by lawyers and existing IP rights holders with limited consideration of smaller players, consumers and the economic impact of IP policy decisions and, 

 3\) in the CI, where miscommunication and biases have limited the potential for new policy that can tackle contemporary IP issues and support more sustainable business models. This research informs her advisory roles on the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \(EPSRC\) Digital Economy Project Advisory Board and the UK Intellectual Property Office \(IPO\) Research Expert Advisory Group.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 On an everyday basis, IP law dictates innovators’ and creators’ ability to benefit from the fruits of their innovation and mediates the relationship between artists and their works. IP law also affects consumers, influencing the price of creative goods and the legal parameters of consumption. 

 The pace of economic impact of digital technology and market changes is now much faster than policy development, and Searle’s work serves as an important intermediary between the two. By developing a common language, or ‘lingua franca’, between economists, lawyers and policy makers, Searle’s work with the UK Intellectual Property Office \(IPO\), the UN’s Worldwide Intellectual Property Office \(WIPO\) and with communities of IP legal practitioners has influenced the fundamental nature of policy debate \[S1, S2, S3\]. By supporting evidence\-based policy\-making and shaping debates, her work improves the IP environment for creators and consumers around the world by impacting policy and practice. 

 **Informing policy\-making at the UK IPO** 

 Searle’s research \[R2\], as noted by Campbell, a BBC lawyer, unpicks the environment in which ‘Governments place more weight on economic data to drive IP policy making’ \[S4\]. Her work identifies these challenges and builds a consensus across the law and economics divisions in policymaking in the creative industries. 

 Searle’s advisory work with the UK IPO has supported changes in policy development by encouraging policy\-makers to gain input from previously ignored stakeholders including smaller creators and consumers. The findings of Searle’s CI business model research, which indicates the challenges faced by CI are not dominated by IP but by other forces \[R1, R4, R5\], encouraged policymakers in the UK IPO to focus on market and Small and Medium Enterprises \(SME\) support, rather than direct legal interventions, as corroborated by the IPO \[S1\]: 

 “Economic analysis and evidence building in the IPO’s policy area is challenging, and Dr Searle has adopted creative approaches to tackle these challenging topics \[…\] Using Dr Searle’s insights, alongside other independently commissioned research enables the IPO to better delineate between areas appropriate for legal interventions and those more suited to market support. For example, her research on copyright and business models has helped us target our business outreach so that it better supports UK SMEs.” 

 This recommendation features in the IPO guide, which has been made available to developing nations, through cooperation with WIPO. 

 **Influencing IP Policy in the United Nations** 

 Searle regularly presents to policy\-makers \(UK IPO, The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport \(DCMS\), UN, EU\) and stakeholders \(governments, lawyers, consumers and other organisations across the CI value chain domestically and internationally\), serving as a peer reviewer for government reports, domestically \(UK IPO, DCMS\) and internationally \(UN, EU\) to support the use of robust analysis, to ensure results are not unduly influenced by outliers or observational bias. 

 For example, in 2015, Searle, based on her CI body of research \(\[R1, R6\] and earlier\), reviewed and edited drafts of the WIPO Report on the African Fashion Design Industry: Capturing Value through Intellectual Property. Working with WIPO at the African Ministerial Conference in Dakar, Senegal, Searle supported discussions on the report and policymaking on fashion and IP in African countries. These talks led to the Dakar Declaration on Intellectual Property for Africa \(2015\) in which the ministerial members committed to, “Enhance innovative and creative capacities by providing a conducive environment with dynamic IP systems that propel creativity, innovation and inventiveness…,” amongst other commitments. The Dakar declaration cites both the WIPO report and the conference proceedings, with references to the importance of the socioeconomic context, of IP in the CI, as promoted by Searle \[S2\]. The declaration helped develop a culture that encourages “powerful institutions like the World Trade Organisation \(WTO\) and WIPO to meet Africa where it is, rather than impose legislation and regulation,” in keeping with Searle’s focus on the socio\-economic nuance of IP. 

 **Changing Attitudes towards economic analysis of IP amongst IP Practitioners** 

 Searle’s research has convinced communities of legal practitioners to take a “level\-headed, sympathetic approach to intellectual property rights” \[S5\]. 

 Alienated by theory\-heavy economics research which bears little resemblance to the realities of copyright law in digital era, the IP legal community has traditionally viewed economic analysis of IP with extreme scepticism. By sharing her research through the IPKat, the world’s largest and most popular English\-speaking IP blog, with a subscriber list of 15,000 readers and 20,400 Twitter followers, ranked the ‘Most Popular Intellectual Property Blawg’ and ‘Most Popular Copyright Blog’ of all time by Justia \(an international legal resource website\), Searle has convinced IP legal practitioner and policy communities to go beyond a legal academic analysis and embed economic thinking into their practice and governance \[S3a, S6\]. This in turn ensures that the interests of copyright holders, creators and consumers are upheld. Searle has been the “sole economist member of the IPKat team”, whose writing, according to one lawyer, “has significantly enabled our readers to better understand how economic perspectives and analyses can be brought to bear on a wide range of IP issues”, helps to “bridge the longstanding gap between economic and legal thinking regarding IP” and has; “shaped the IP community’s  viewpoints \[.. \] encouraging interdisciplinary approaches and improved evidence\-based policy\-making” \[S3a\]. 

 Providing a new space for debate about the application of economic analysis, Searle’s IPKat articles written during the REF period on the economics of IP have amassed over 193,000 views and 370 comments as of July 2020, meaning both a large readership and high levels of engagement. In addition to continued activity on her back catalogue, REF period blog posts were read on average 2,400 times \(2013\-2020\) \[S6\]. To put this in context, over a similar period \(2010\-2017\), the average LSE public facing blog post was read 1,400 times\*.  Her blog post, “Some Economics of Collecting Societies” \(Collecting societies are organisations responsible for the collective of copyright royalties\) prompted the editor of the Intellectual Property Magazine, a US\-based international practitioner publication, to publish a letter supporting her convictions that collecting societies lacked transparency \[S7\]. Such a provocation would have previously been an anathema in a professional publication, given the social and political capital these societies hold amongst legal practitioners. However, Searle’s challenge to long held beliefs has increased awareness of the economic context of IP law \[S8, S9\] and spurred self\-reflection in the IP practitioner community which prompted this influential practitioner to publicly question their practice \[S7, S10\]. This work continues with economics and IP projects for IP policy and practice forums \[G3\], and policymakers \[G4\]. 

 Nurturing a forum for debate represents a significant development for the culture of legal practitioners, as evidenced in this testimonial: 

 “The creative industries, an industry Dr. Searle has worked on extensively, has undergone dramatic changes in recent years and put significant pressure on copyright regimes. Nicola has patiently and clearly communicated her research in this area. She has helped my fellow IP lawyers better understand economics and be more sympathetic to its arguments.” 

 Amongst this community, Searle’s work provokes self\-reflection and challenges its scepticism of economics, encourages reflection on how changes to economics impact IP rights, and engenders support for economic analysis and in\-depth analyses of the relationship between IP law and economics.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Research in the Hull Academic Vascular Surgical Unit \(AVSU\) has directly impacted policy, practice and clinical education in the management of intermittent claudication \(IC\) a condition that affects 5% of the western adult population. Invasive revascularisation was frequently the first\-line intervention for IC, with outcomes assessed using objective measures. The AVSU has undertaken seminal research that identified the best quality of life instruments for outcome assessment in IC, which are now recommended by international reporting standards. The Hull unit demonstrated clinical and cost effectiveness of supervised exercise programmes \(SEP\), compared with invasive revascularisation, stimulating a global revolution in IC management with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence now recommending SEP as the first\-line intervention. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Historically, intermittent claudication \(IC\) was managed conservatively or by invasive revascularisation \(angioplasty or bypass surgery\). Objective measures of organ perfusion such as ankle pressures or treadmill walking distances were used to assess disease progression and treatment effectiveness. The Academic Vascular Surgical Unit \(AVSU\), led by Professor Ian Chetter, has worked for over 2 decades to: 

1.  ensure patient\-reported quality of life \(QoL\) outcomes are prioritised and regarded as the standard for outcome assessment in both clinical practice and new clinical trials \( **2.1\)** and; 

1.  provide conclusive evidence to support the use of supervised exercise programmes \(SEP\) as the global, first\-line, intervention for claudication rather than invasive revascularization **\(2.2\)** Furthermore, the work of the AVSU has underpinned international reporting standards, clinical guidelines and associated training, and has led to significant patient benefit. 

 **Key research findings** 

 **2.1** **Identification of the most appropriate generic and disease specific QoL instruments for patients with IC** 

 Based on a long\-standing programme of research in Hull, the team found the Short Form 36 and EuroQoL instruments were the most appropriate *generic* QoL tools in terms of validity, reliability and responsiveness for use with patients suffering with IC **\[1\]**. Research findings demonstrated that the correlation between clinical indicators of disease severity and QoL was not sufficiently close to assume that changes in the clinical indicators resulted in reciprocal changes in QoL, and thus it was  concluded that QoL must be analysed independently **\[2\]**. The 2003 systematic review by the AVSU **\[1\]** also highlighted that disease\-specific instruments for patients with claudication had undergone very limited evaluation. A subsequent prospective cohort study of 70 claudicants, identified the VascuQol tool as the most appropriate disease\-specific QoL instrument for this patient group **\[3\]**. 

 **2.2 Demonstration that supervised exercise programmes \(SEP\) were more effective at management of IC compared with surgical interventions.** 

 Using both the generic and disease\-specific outcome measures, the AVSU demonstrated in a non\-randomised, controlled, trial of 70 claudicants, that SEP was both clinically\- and cost\-effective compared with conservative medical therapy and that the disease\-specific, VascuQol tool was again the most powerful **\[4\]**. In 2010, the AVSU published early outcomes from the first adequately powered \(n=178\), randomized, controlled, trial comparing SEP, angioplasty \(a commonly used surgical intervention\) and SEP plus angioplasty. Based on clinical and QoL changes at 3 months, it was concluded that SEP should be the primary treatment for claudicants and that angioplasty should always be preceded by a SEP **\[5\]**. The AVSU’s subsequent work, including long term follow\-up of this cohort, health economic analysis and Cochrane systematic review has confirmed the original conclusions  and also identified the supplementary benefits of SEP in terms of general physical activity, balance and reduction in falls risk **\[6\]**. 

 Our studies have identified that the “Achilles heel” of SEP is patient uptake, which can be as low as 25%. Qualitative research from the AVSU has identified the 3\-month duration of the intervention as a frequently cited reason for non\-participation. To address these issues, the AVSU is currently investigating the acceptability, efficacy and patient perceptions of a concentrated, short duration \(6 weeks\), anaerobic, high intensity SEP funded by an NIHR RfPB grant \(£149,292\) to ensure maximum patient benefit.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Based on the research from the AVSU at Hull there has been an international step\-change in both the assessment of outcomes and the shift to non\-interventional management of IC. This has resulted in significant benefits for patients, practitioners and health care institutions alike. Specifically, there has been a significant change to using patient\-focused outcomes as a measure of treatment for IC \( **4.1**\); widespread adoption of SEP as a non\-invasive treatment alternative for IC management \( **4.2**\); and incorporation of SEP into multiple national and international training guidelines \( **4.3**\). 

 **4.1 A paradigm shift to patient\-focused outcomes in recent and ongoing trials** 

 Research from Hull has underpinned a number of international guidelines that now recommend the use of both generic and disease\-specific QoL outcome measures to assess efficacy of intervention in IC \( **Evidence 1**\). Furthermore, our research supported the prioritization of the generic and disease\-specific outcome measures in the guidelines update for the management of peripheral arterial disease in 2015 \( **Evidence 2**\). Additionally, Prof Chetter was/is a member of the **Trial Management Groups for 3 recently completed/ongoing National Institute of Health Research \(NIHR\) trials which have all incorporated patient\-focused outcome measures**. The NIHR HTA “ *Bypass v Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg*” \(BASIL 2\) \(completed with 345 participants\) and BASIL3 \(Ongoing until May 2021 with recruitment aimed at 477 participants\) trials include generic \(EuroQol 5D, Short Form12\) and disease\-specific \(VascuQol, \( **Evidence 3i,.ii**\). The completed NIHR EME “ *Does Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Improve the Absolute Walking Distance in Patients with Intermittent Claudication*” **\(**NESIC\) trial \(192 participants\) includes generic \(EQ5D, Short Form 36\) and disease specific \(intermittent claudication questionnaire\) as outcome measures \( **Evidence 3iii**\). 

 **4.2 Widespread uptake of SEP as first line intervention for IC** 

 Hull’s research is an essential component of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) clinical guidelines 147 \(Diagnosis and management of peripheral arterial disease\) which recommend that SEP should be offered as first\-line intervention for all patients with IC, replacing angioplasty that should only be offered if a SEP has not produced satisfactory symptomatic improvement \( **Evidence 4**\). **Patients that have received SEP report that they are able to walk much “ **further without experiencing pain**” \(Evidence 5i\) and that their “ **quality of life has improved considerably”** \(Evidence 5ii\).** International guidelines in North America, proposed jointly by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology \( **Evidence 6**\) and Europe \( **Evidence 1**\) advocate the same treatment plans again based on Hull’s published work. 

 During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic the Circulation Foundation, the UK's only national peripheral arterial disease charity, recognized the AVSU’s longstanding expertise in the area of SEP research, and asked the unit to produce a booklet detailing home\-based SEP for patients in isolation \( **Evidence 7i**\). Ms Rachel Bell, Chair of the Circulation Foundation stated, “... the research undertaken in Hull by Prof Chetter’s team has a huge impact upon our work and is incredibly beneficial to the mission of our charity” \( **Evidence 7ii**\). 

 **4.3 Impacts on healthcare practitioner training and service providers** 

 The UK Specialty Advisory Committee for Vascular Surgical Training has, since 2018, included SEP as the first line therapy for IC into the recent additions of the UK curricula for training vascular surgeons, nurses and podiatrists, thus all new trainees in the breadth of disciplines involved in treating IC are implementing the practice defined by Hull’s work \( **Evidence 8i, ii, iii**\). The Vascular Society of Great Britain & Ireland \(VSGBI\) produced a document entitled “ *The provision of services for patients with vascular disease 2018*”, which sets out the principles by which a vascular service should deliver optimal patient care in the UK. This publication was based on the research from the AVSU in Hull and advocates offering SEP to all patients with IC \( **Evidence 9**\). The Past\-president of the VSGBI states that the AVSU’s work on SEP has “ *revolutionized the thinking of practitioners and available treatment methods*” \( **Evidence 10**\). **The new training regimens are cost\-effective and represent a non\-invasive alterative not previously available**. Research from Hull highlighted the huge variability in the provision of SEP for IC, which may only be provided by as few as 42% of UK vascular units. As a result of these findings in 2018 NICE released a Quality statement identifying the provision of SEP for IC as a high priority area for quality improvement across the UK \( **Evidence 11**\). Furthermore, the training has been adopted across Europe as this fulfills the current best\-practice guidelines \( **Evidence 12**\) *.* 

  

 Similarly, in response to Public Health England’s “Getting It Right First Time \(GIRFT\)” programme highlighting lack of timely access to services for patients with peripheral arterial disease \( **Evidence 13**\) the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland produced a Quality Improvement Framework\(QIF\) in 2019 aimed at providing a best practice clinical care pathway for peripheral arterial disease. This QIF includes a target of >90% UK vascular units to provide commissioned SEP within 1 hour travel time for patients with IC \( **Evidence 14**\)

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Successful ablation of cardiac arrhythmias requires accurate localization of the origin of the aberrant myocardial electrical activity. Ripple Mapping was developed at Imperial College to provide visual 3D representation of tachycardias during patient electrophysiological studies, facilitating anatomical interpretation of the arrhythmia. It increases the success rate and reduces the time needed for curative thermo\-ablation compared to conventional manual mapping. The patent is licensed to Biosense\-Webster and the technology accessed via a drop\-down menu in Johnson & Johnson’s commercial CARTO® CONFIDENSE® Module. Ripple Mapping is recognised in the current European Society of Cardiology Guidelines and used in over 3,000 hospitals worldwide.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The successful treatment of cardiac tachy\-arrhythmias by thermo\-ablation requires accurate localisation of the origin of the aberrant electrical activity. This can be done manually but it makes it a lengthy procedure for the patient, even with a highly trained member of staff. It is also subject to error as it is dependent on arbitrary choices; specifically, determining when a new electrical pulse begins so as to localize the source. This is very difficult to achieve in a standardized manner when pulses have a wide variety of different shapes arising on a dynamic electrical background. 

 Human eyes are very good at detecting even subtle fluctuations in a wide expanse of visual data. Prof Kanagaratnam and colleagues at Imperial College used computer modelling to devise a novel method, Ripple Mapping, that affords 3D visualisation of the intracardiac electrogram during electrophysiological studies of the patient. 

 The concept was first described using data from six individuals; three with atrial tachycardias, two with ventricular tachycardias and one person in sinus rhythm \(1\). It used novel software to construct a three\-dimensional surface from imported electrograms and demonstrate voltage and timing information for all six individuals. It demonstrated how electrical activation of the myocardium could be tracked visually and assist identification of the mechanism of tachycardias and localize the optimal ablation site without the need for an experienced computer\-operating assistant. This was possible due to core expertise in applying mathematical solutions in cardiac problems. 

 On the basis of this report, Biosense Webster licensed the technology and integrated it into a prototype research version of their widely used clinical heart mapping system, “CARTO”. This was then evaluated and improved through a series of studies led by the Imperial team. The first refined the algorithm to streamline the method for data collection and map interpretation algorithm to optimize Ripple Maps in atrial tachycardias \(2\). The second showed utility in visualising the regions of subtle, slow conduction occurring adjacent to the scar of a myocardial infarction in the left ventricle \(3\). The relevance of this critical step is that it is these particular points at which ventricular tachycardia can be exquisitely sensitive to a curative ablation in the cath lab. The third study in this series showed that Ripple Mapping is effective in identifying the key pathways in atrial tachycardia \(4\). Encouraged by these data, Johnson & Johnson progressed Ripple Mapping from a tool in development and incorporated it as a permanent feature in their commercial anatomical electro\-mapping system, CARTO®, now installed in thousands of hospitals across the world. 

 A landmark Ripple\-AT multi\-centre study \(5\) led by Imperial College with Barts, Papworth, Nottingham, Bournemouth and Lisbon randomised 105 patients with atrial tachycardia to Ripple Mapping or conventional mapping and found that Ripple Mapping enabled a substantially higher success rate \(90% versus 71%\) in curing the tachycardia with one set of ablations. A further publication from the trial revealed potential future advances that could make it even easier for operators using Ripple Mapping for the first time to interpret the maps quickly and accurately \(6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Ripple Mapping is a novel technique that permits 3D visual representation of cardiac tachycardias during patient electrophysiological studies. It facilitates the accurate localization of the origin of the arrhythmia and guides curative thermo\-ablation without the need for an experienced computer\-operator assistant. 

 The Patent \(reference US8838216B2\) for this novel technique was filed by Prof Kanagaratnam with Imperial Innovations in May 2008 and granted in the United States in September 2014 \[ **A**\]. The presentation of the initial concept \(1\) led to an intellectual property license agreement between Imperial Innovations and Biosense\-Webster, a Johnson & Johnson company, in 2013. The agreement obtained exclusive rights to Ripple Mapping to commercialise the technique and distribute a licensed product. It also covered future costs and patent maintenance. Johnson & Johnson then incorporated Ripple Mapping as a permanent feature of their commercial CARTO® CONFIDENSE® Module with seamless access using a drop\-down tab procedure \[ **B**\]. This was introduced to the market in 2015 and it has now been rolled\-out to 3,000 hospitals worldwide. 

  

 Johnson & Johnson offer a Ripple Mapping Training program at their Education Centre in Hamburg and ad hoc courses have also run in the UK, US, China, Singapore. The company also features ‘The Value of Ripple Mapping’ as one of their on\-demand learning modules for healthcare professionals \[ **C**\], describing the technique as ‘resulting in a greater understanding in complex arrhythmia diagnosis’. There are several on\-demand learning videos available through the training platform \[ **D**\]. 

 The studies conducted by the Imperial team \(5\) are referenced in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the Management of Supraventricular tachycardia \[ **E**\]. It has been adopted and exhibited by cardiac electrophysiology laboratories outside of Imperial College, using patient case studies to demonstrate the advantages of the technique for optimising identification of suitable sites for ablation. These case studies, available on YouTube, have been viewed several thousand times \[ **F, G**\]. Ripple Mapping is the only technology that has been tested in a randomised controlled study of acute outcomes \(6\). Competing technologies such as Precision® \(Abbot Medical\) and Rhythmia® \(Boston Scientific\) have not been tested in any prospective, randomised controlled studies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Ferry’s research into public sector audit and accountability has significantly changed United Kingdom \(UK\) government thinking and policy making, which has in turn enhanced public accountability of local government spending. Ferry’s work with the House of Commons \(HoC\) Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee \(HCLG\) was followed by the government of the UK ordering a major review of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014. The review by Sir Tony Redmond, the only high\-level review in recent years focussed on public sector audit and financial reporting, engaged Ferry as a central part of the Steering Panel and made many recommendations based on Ferry’s findings. The Redmond Review’s report, published in September 2020, calls for a comprehensive overhaul of the current regulatory arrangements including primary legislation to establish a “new regulatory body responsible for procurement, contract management, regulation, and oversight of local audit”. The UK Government responded to this review in December 2020, and is already in agreement with 60% of the recommendations; most of the remaining recommendations are being further considered by the Government before they make a further response. Ferry’s research and engagement with the public audit community has also translated into changes to the National Audit Office \(NAO\) Code of Audit Practice \(published April 2020\). The effect of the changes in government thinking, the Redmond review and NAO Audit Code will radically improve financial resilience of Local Authority spending and its efficacy for local populations.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 \(LAA Act 2014\) was the most significant regulatory change in over three decades to public audit, bringing in ‘new’ audit and inspection arrangements, for English local government and other local public bodies. It finalised the closure of the Audit Commission originally announced in 2010, thereby fundamentally changing the English local government regulatory system \(R4\). The changes from the LAA Act 2014 are critical for public service delivery, as England’s 365 local authorities are the main conduit for public expenditure in England, with a net revenue budget of over GBP95billion for 2018/19, over 20% of total UK public sector expenditure. The impact of local government is also highly significant to other public services \(such as Education, NHS, Police, Fire Services\) due to joint work; and to the private sector, due to the effect on local communities and the extent of public service delivery and commissioning involving private sector partners. Therefore, the accountability of local authority finances is of high significance to social value in terms of the social, economic and environmental wellbeing of citizens across England \(R3\). 

 Against the backdrop of the 2014 Act, Ferry has undertaken detailed qualitative and quantitative research into financial resilience, value for money and fairness in English local government, during a period when the central government operated a policy of ‘austerity\-localism’, \(significant cuts to local government budgets whilst at the same time affording local authorities substantially more power to make decisions locally\) which radically changed accountability regimes for public services \(R2\-R6\). 

 An overarching motivation for Ferry’s body of work is that public audit’s purpose is to create accountability for the state and democracy \(R3, R4\). The post\-Audit Commission public audit regime includes financial audit, giving an opinion on financial accounts, and whether Value for Money \(VfM\) arrangements are in place, but the inspection elements of audit, which determine whether VfM and fairness has been achieved, have been removed \(R3\). A key finding from Ferry’s research is that the current focus on financial stewardship can be to the detriment of VfM \(R3, R4, R6\) and fairness \(R3, R4\). He highlighted challenges for the new accountability regime that included the fact that transparency may not adequately replace accountability, due to the loss of formal information. This is because the audit requirements for local government were significantly reduced, shrinking both the audit cost but also the level of scrutiny \(more detailed audit costs more\), and hence the information available to the taxpayer \(and others\) since 2010 on where money is being spent has also been significantly reduced \(R3, R4\). Ferry also identified that the reduction in performance information is constraining public reporting, scrutiny and public assurance \(R2, R3, R4, R6\), and the changing mix of accountability and transparency may involve VfM risks \(R3, R4\). Ultimately, he highlighted the dangers this has for actual and perceived fairness in society \(R2, R5\). Ferry therefore proposed a broader approach for public audit that covered financial stewardship, VfM and fairness to uphold accountability for the state and democracy \(R3, R4\). 

 Ferry’s successful fellowship application enabled his unique access to Parliamentary archives, as a Parliamentary Academic Fellow and then Adviser. He developed and presented a scoping report for the HoC HCLG on accountability in local government. The HoC HCLG then supported Ferry to produce his published Parliament Report \(R1\), combining findings from his previous research with an extensive documentation review of practitioner and academic literature and new work through Parliamentary enabled/supported access to ‘elite’ stakeholders during this period. Ferry conducted over 50 interviews of key players in the local government audit sphere; politicians, government and Parliamentary officials, the NAO, think tanks, accountancy firms and consultants. The published report covers savings from regulatory changes, fragmentation of bodies involved, auditor independence, audit scope, audit competition and sustainability of the market, inspection and intervention arrangements, and implications for accountability and democracy. The full report was published by the House of Commons Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee in July 2019.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Professor Ferry has undertaken a range of activities in recent years to ensure that his research findings reach policymakers, including extensive work with government and accounting / accountability organisations, informing policy debates around resilience, VfM and fairness in communities, regions and society. His appointment as a Parliamentary Academic Fellow, working with the House of Commons Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee from March 2018, was the culmination of his earlier activities, which include giving extensive written and oral evidence to the UK Parliament, and working closely with organisations such as the NAO, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\), the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy \(CIPFA\) and the Centre for Public Scrutiny \(CfPS\), where he disseminates, discusses, and advises on his research \(including R1\-R6\), feeding into their activities and practices \[E1, E4, E5, E9, E10\]. 

 Ferry’s written submissions to HoC HCLG enquiries have included those to: 1\) The “Brexit and Local Government” enquiry, which led to his giving oral evidence to the committee \[E9\] in December 2017, focussing on what this may mean for the role of local government and place\-based accountability especially given the increased commercialisation of local public services; and 2\) the “Government interventions: the use of Commissioners in Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets” enquiry. The latter’s report quotes Ferry’s submission, in which he refers to his research findings, that austerity\-localism causes problems in ensuring that local authorities provide value for money: “The framework is geared to prevent financial failure, which means financial pressure will more likely lead to service rather than financial impacts” \[E10\]. The HoC Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee's 2017 report on ""Accounting for democracy: making sure Parliament, the people and ministers know how and why public money is spent"" cites a written submission by Ferry and Dr Chow \(a former Durham colleague\), that “under accrual accounting the revenue and expenditure statement will include items previously hidden from view”. This feeds into one of the report's recommendations, that ""Accruals accounting has allowed Parliament and the public to gain a better understanding of how the Government uses its resources and manages its assets and liabilities. Accruals accounting is therefore a good basis for the further work"" \[E10\]. 

 The greatest impacts on policy of Ferry’s research, however, arise from his work as a Parliamentary Academic Fellow with the HoC HCLG from March 2018 to December 2019 \(the appointment was extended beyond the usual 12 months\) \[E7\], and his subsequent appointment in 2020 as an Adviser to the Committee. In both roles, Ferry worked with Select Committee MPs and officers in a research/advisory capacity concerning accountability and procedure arrangements. Ferry’s work with the Committee coincided with the need for scrutiny of the LAA Act 2014. As the HoC HCLG committee clerk \(until July 2019\) Ed Beale states: *“Laurence’s original work proposals \(sic\) was to conduct research on local government accountability, particularly in a post\-Brexit landscape. This was particularly attractive to the Committee… due to the fact the Committee was conducting an inquiry on the impact of Brexit on Local Government, and secondly because I knew the Committee would be required to conduct post\-legislative scrutiny of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 at some point in 2020.”* Ferry’s scoping report led to the Committee, chaired by Clive Betts MP, requesting a full Parliamentary report \(R1\). As Ed Beale attests *: “Clive agreed with the proposal and approach and felt it would be a valuable contribution to inform the Committee’s future work”* \[E7\]. 

 Ferry produced a full report for Parliament \(R1\), “Audit and Inspection of Local Authorities in England: Five years after the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014”, underpinned by his research \(R2 – R6\), and extended via new research benefiting from his fellowship that supported HoC access to documents, and interviews with key stakeholders. The report’s executive summary was presented to, and approved by, the Chair and Clerk of the Select Committee. The full report was presented to the full HoC HCLG committee in July 2019 \[E7\] and formally published by the Committee, with the endorsement of the Committee Clerk that it was *“considered … outstanding and high quality”* \[E7\]. It is now available on the UK Parliament website. 

 The Select Committee chair, Clive Betts MP, formally sent Ferry’s published report to the Secretary of State *“to help inform the post\-legislative scrutiny evaluation of the Act”* \[E6\]. *“It is extremely unusual for the Committee to share with the Ministry any publication except its own reports”*, attests Betts, who also stated that once the Government published their evaluation of the Act, Ferry’s report would be *“the basis of the Committee’s consideration”* \(of the evaluation findings\) \[E8\]. 

 As a result of the work of Ferry and the select committee, drawing attention to the fact that a higher level of scrutiny of the LAA Act 2014 than legally required was necessary, the Secretary of State announced in July 2019 \[E3, E6\] that Sir Tony Redmond would carry out an independent review of the local authority audit framework and of the transparency of local authority financial reporting in England. Upon receiving Ferry’s report from the Committee, the Secretary of State commented that he was “ *confident it will help to inform Sir Tony’s findings”* and that he expected *“Sir Tony will want to meet separately with … Professor Ferry”* \[E6\]. This review is the first to be fully focused in recent years on public sector audit, after four recent reports focussing on issues in the private sector \(Brydon, Competition and Markets Authority, Kingman and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee\). Ferry was subsequently invited by Redmond to sit on the Review’s seven\-member Advisory Panel as the only academic expert, alongside high\-ranking members of Government departments and auditing organisations \[E1, E3\]. The Panel endorsed using the HCLG Select Committee \(Ferry’s\) report \[R1\] as *“it contains useful evidence which could be utilised by the Review”* \[E3\] and Ferry was also interviewed as part of the review. Redmond attested that Ferry’s *“knowledge and expertise have been invaluable”* and that his *“report \- Audit and Inspection of Local Authorities in England: Five years after the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014, will play a part in informing the final Report and recommendations”* \[E3\]. 

 Alongside the Redmond Review, 2020 saw the publication of the NAO’s latest Audit Code of Practice, for auditors of local authorities, health bodies, police and fire. Ferry’s findings led to changes to the Code, which now enables local auditors to feed information to the NAO, and around consideration of financial resilience and VfM matters; the NAO’s Director Aileen Murphie attested \(prior to the Code’s publication\) that *“a loss of available information for the public on value for money locally is well proven by your \[Ferry’s\] work and has been picked up by the NAO as an issue in the renewal of Code of Audit Practice”*, and that Ferry’s recent work led to *“much discussion and helped to move the revised Code towards a proposed narrative value for money conclusion … The new conclusion should be much more tailored to the issues of individual places, their financial resilience and be a great deal more informative.”* The Audit Guidance Notes, used by auditors to interpret the Code, have also been informed by Ferry’s work \[E4\]. 

 The Redmond Review report was published in September 2020, recommending significant changes to public audit \[E1\], including tackling many issues highlighted by Ferry in his Parliamentary report \[R1\]; *“I have been guided by the need to see more accountability and transparency in the local audit system and my proposed recommendations reflect these principles”* said Redmond \[E1\]. These include the recommendation that an Office of Local Audit Regulation is created to oversee, procure, manage and regulate the external audits of local authorities in England. The creation of such a body requires primary legislation, and such discussions of a law change will bring this issue into the wider Parliamentary consciousness. This new body would overcome the serious concerns highlighted by Ferry around fragmentation of the current bodies involved in the audit process, and auditor independence and sustainability of the market, around audit competition. The implications around audit scope concerning VfM arising in particular from Ferry’s report were also considered by Redmond; Redmond endorsed the changes to the latest NAO Audit Code of Practice from earlier in 2020 that Ferry’s research had also informed. In addition, inspection concerns relating to service and financial viability are recommended by Redmond to be shared between local auditors and inspectorates, further reflecting points highlighted by Ferry. Finally, a simplified statement of service information and costs is also recommended to be prepared by each local authority to assist comparison with what was promised and to enable a judgment on performance, addressing some of Ferry’s concerns around performance information. Overall, these recommendations to the government by Redmond strengthen public accountability for democracy in line with Ferry’s research. 

 Upon the publication of the Redmond report, the Secretary of State for Local Government, the Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP, stated that *he “will consider the findings and recommendations carefully”*; the press release also confirmed that the MHCLG would *“carefully consider the recommendations proposed, which will play an important strategic role in strengthening the overall framework for local accountability”* \[E1\]. On 17 December 2020, the UK Government’s MHCLG published their response to the Redmond Review. Of the 23 recommendations made by the review, the Ministry agreed to 14 of the recommendations, partly agreed to a further 2, and are considering the other 7 recommendations further, offering a full response to these in Spring 2021 \[E2\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The COVID\-19 pandemic has had global impact requiring response from all countries. The Imperial team rapidly developed epidemiological models and undertook underpinning data analysis to support the UK and global response. Key evidence in March 2020, demonstrating the need to move to a suppression strategy to avoid the NHS becoming overwhelmed, led to the first UK national lockdown whilst weekly estimates of the reproduction number R, the epidemic growth rate and medium\-term projections were used to support UK government policy and NHS planning. Analysis of the novel variant in December 2020 demonstrated its increased transmissibility resulting in tightening of restrictions. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Through the establishment of the Medical Research Council \(MRC\) Global Infectious Disease Analysis \(GIDA\) Centre in 2007, Imperial researchers developed statistical methods and mathematical modelling to support pandemic preparedness and response. In early 2020, the team focused: \(i\) estimating the speed and extent of spread \- showing much higher levels of infection in Wuhan than had been reported and \(ii\) estimating severity utilising data emerging from China, summarised as age\-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio \(IFR\) \(1\). 

  

 To support the UK response an individual\-based simulation model developed for influenza pandemic planning \(2\) was re\-parameterised to explore policy scenarios, including home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of household members, social distancing and school closures. Working closely with the NHS executive, model parameter assumptions were aligned with emerging UK data to output demand on hospital beds and intensive care facilities in the UK. This demonstrated that under even the most stringent mitigation scenarios \(whereby transmission is reduced but not interrupted\), UK health services would quickly become overwhelmed \(“Report 9” \(3\)\). In contrast, suppression strategies, whilst enabling the epidemic to be brought quickly under control, would need to be intermittently sustained until other therapeutic options became available. 

  

 A stochastic compartmental model was developed to provide real\-time estimates of the epidemic and short\-term projections of hospital demand \(4\). This was fitted to sub\-national UK data with updates provided at least weekly to the SPI\-M modelling subgroup, Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) and other government departments. These included estimates of the reproduction number and epidemic growth rate, and projections of number of infections, cases, hospitalisations, and deaths in different sub\-populations, including care homes. Model\-based analyses were also performed in support of the test\- and trace strategy, quantifying the impact of PCR\-testing of symptomatic cases \(and self\-isolation of positive cases\), weekly screening of health\-care workers and contact tracing on transmission. 

  

 Internationally, country\-level estimates were provided in March for the potential scale and impact of different strategies globally using a compartmental SEIR model. This model was subsequently extended to understand how epidemiological differences \(including demography and mixing patterns\) and differences in healthcare supply and quality could lead to different outcomes \(and hence appropriate responses\) in low\- and middle\-income countries \(LMIC\) compared to high\-income countries \(5\). From May, the model was fitted at least weekly to data from all LMIC with country summary outputs provided on an  [open\-access dashboard](https://mrc-ide.github.io/global-lmic-reports/). 

  

 The team developed renewal equation models to determine the impact of specific non\-pharmaceutical interventions \(NPIs\) \(6\). Estimates of their effectiveness in Europe and the US were provided on open\-access  [dashboards](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/covid-19-planning-tools/). The framework was subsequently expanded to track the UK epidemic at the local authority area, with a public dashboard developed to provide short\-term projections of the incidence per population head and the  [reproductive number](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/covid19local/) R. 

  

 Towards the end of 2020 rapid research was undertaken to evaluate the significance of a new variant of SARS\-Cov\-2 that had emerged in the UK, with phylodynamic analysis coupled with epidemiological analysis demonstrating significantly increased transmissibility of the new variant of concern.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>UK early response</ins> <ins>\(January \- April 2020\)</ins> 

 Long\-term investment by the MRC in the GIDA Centre at Imperial meant that as the pandemic emerged, staff were in place to rapidly respond, with over 50 staff and students mobilised in the first 6 months of the pandemic. The early work of the Imperial team was cited in the UK coronavirus action plan published on 3 March \[ **A**\]. A summary of scientific evidence supporting the response to coronavirus published on 26 June \[ **B**\] includes a unique section on “Imperial College Reports”, including the first 8 online reports and reference \(1 above\) which provided the most robust estimates of the IFR. During February 2020, several Imperial College reports submitted to SAGE \(meetings 9, 10, 12 and 13 \[ **C**\]\) directly informed SAGE advice to government. These include evidence of the potential impact of a range of NPIs \- including banning of large gatherings, school closures and isolation of the elderly. 

 Whilst multiple UK teams contributed to the modelling evidence underpinning the UK lockdown that occurred in March 2020, “Report 9” \(ref 3 above\) was clearly one of the most globally influential, with the highest ever global score for impact in the Altmetric database \(63,840 mentions as of 31 December 2020\). The policy report summarised scenarios for NPIs developed in close collaboration with SAGE and the Government Office for Science. The results contained in this report were shared with SAGE, the government Chief Scientific Advisor, Chief Medical Officer, the NHS executive and Downing Street in the days preceding the first announcement from the UK government of a move to a suppression strategy on 16 March 2020 \[ **D**\] that subsequently led to the first UK lockdown on 23 March 2020. The widespread global media coverage of Report 9 generated considerable global impact as evidenced by a 35% drop in global mobility from 17 March determined using Google mobility data \( [https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)\). 

 <ins>UK</ins> <ins>response \(May 2020 \- December 2020\)</ins> 

 From May 2020 the UK government has published weekly estimates of the reproduction number, R, and associated growth rates \[ **E**\], of which the Imperial team is one of several contributing modelling groups. These estimates, provided as part of a SPI\-M\-O “consensus statement”, are shared across government departments, the NHS and local resilience forums and are used widely for planning purposes and to support local and national responses, thereby directly impacting the course of the UK epidemic. 

 The Imperial team have additionally provided medium\-term projections to support government departments in the form of “Reasonable Worst\-Case \(RWC\)” projections \[ **F**\]. Similar RWC outputs were developed for an independent report produced by the Academy of Medical Sciences highlighting the need to prepare for a challenging winter period \[ **G**\]. As testing capacity increased in the UK and NHS Test and Trace was established, Imperial research directly informed the policy on mass testing \[ **H**\]. 

 In December 2020, phylodynamic analysis provided the first estimates of increased transmissibility of the new Variant of Concern 202012/01 \(VOC\) of up to 70%, the figure cited by the Prime Minister in his statement on 19<sup>th</sup> December \[ **I**\] that led to the decision to put more regions of the UK into Tier 4 restriction, and eventually the 3<sup>rd</sup> UK national lockdown. 

 <ins>International</ins> <ins>response</ins> 

 During the early phase of the pandemic, the Imperial College team worked closely with World Health Organisation \(WHO\) as an official modelling collaborating centre, providing estimates of the transmissibility and severity of SARS\-CoV\-2 during January and February 2020. In March 2020, in response to a direct request from WHO, global estimates of the potential scale of the epidemic across all countries were developed \(“ *Report 12*” subsequently published as academic reference \(6\)\) that were shared across several United Nation organisations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Global Fund to inform early resource planning.  An open\-access  [dashboard](https://mrc-ide.github.io/global-lmic-reports/) accessed over 73,000 times as 31 December 2020, was developed and a user interface to the model software \( [www.covidsim.org](http://www.covidsim.org/)\) used by WHO to support country planning.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Demographic trends in the UK population have placed an increasing burden on Hospital Eye Services \(HES\). Research conducted at City, University of London has demonstrated that community optometrists are able to provide specialist services that match care in hospital eye departments and that these services are clinically effective, cost\-effective and associated with high levels of patient satisfaction. Our findings have influenced national ophthalmic service redesign through the commissioning of optometrist\-delivered specialist services. In parallel, City has developed clinical management guidelines \(CMGs\) for common eye conditions that have been adopted in national eye care pathways and have been incorporated into clinical guidelines and decision support tools internationally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 There is an escalating problem in the delivery of emergency and routine eye care services in the UK. For example, the number of patients attending emergency eye units in London is increasing by approximately 10% per year. Up to 20% of referrals to ophthalmology clinics are for suspected glaucoma, with an estimated annual cost of monitoring these patients of over GBP 22,000,000. There is an urgent need to manage the flow of patients between primary and secondary care and ensure that patients are seen by the most appropriate healthcare professional, in the most suitable setting, and in a timely manner, to minimise the likelihood of visual loss. There are several new models of community\-based eye care, such as Minor Eye Conditions Services \(MECS\) and community\-based Glaucoma Referral Filtering Services \(GRFS\) for suspect glaucoma, that have the potential to decrease demand on the HES by reducing unnecessary referrals. 

 Research led by academics at City, University of London \( *Lawrenson and Edgar*\), in collaboration with health economists from the University of Manchester \( *Sutton, Mason,* and *Forbes*\) has significantly strengthened the evidence\-base for the clinical effectiveness and cost\-effectiveness of MECS and GRFS and has shown that the schemes are well\-received by all stakeholders. 

 The College of Optometrists\-funded Enhanced Scheme Evaluation Project \(ESEP\), conducted in the period 2012\-2016, evaluated models of community\-based eye care services to assess their clinical effectiveness and cost\-effectiveness. This mixed\-methods study used a combination of evidence synthesis, which is a new method of systematic review designed for complex policy interventions, and a detailed case study methodology. 

 As part of this project, we published the first evidence synthesis on the effectiveness of enhanced \(community\) eye care services in the UK \[3.1\]. This widely cited realist synthesis found evidence that optometrists are able to work safely in defined areas of clinical practice while maintaining or improving the quality of outcomes for patients. Detailed case\-study evaluations of MECS and GRFS have demonstrated clinical effectiveness, clinical safety, reduction in hospital attendances and waiting times, cost savings and high levels of patient satisfaction \[3.2 – 3.4\].  For example, compared to a companion area without the service, MECS led to a differential reduction in general practitioner \(GP\) referrals to hospital ophthalmology departments of 40\-75% with a 14% reduction in unit costs and an associated shortening of waiting times \[3.3\].  Similarly, GRFS resulted in a decrease of 53% in the number of false positive glaucoma referrals, with a false negative rate of <1%. Reducing false positive referrals clearly benefits both the hospital and the patient and can be achieved without compromising clinical safety. 

 A body of research by *Lawrenson* over the past 10 years has led to the publication of systematic reviews in priority areas of eye care to inform decision\-making and explore major gaps in the clinical evidence base for eye care This has included 10 Cochrane reviews and updates, and seven reviews published in ophthalmology and optometry journals. This research expertise, \( *Lawrenson* is co\-ordinating editor for Cochrane Eyes and Vision\), has been applied to the writing of systematic reviews \[3.5\] and conducting evidence syntheses for the development of clinical management guidelines \(CMGs\), which are effectively commissioned items of research synthesis \[3.6\]. CMGs are a key component of the clinical effectiveness of new models of community\-based eye care; they have been shown to address clinical uncertainties and support community optometrists in the diagnosis and management of eye conditions that present most frequently in primary care.

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The research conducted as part of the ESEP has provided a solid evidence base for the clinical safety and cost\-effectiveness of enhanced services provided by community optometrists. The outputs from the ESEP, and previous research by the City team investigating effectiveness and refinement of glaucoma referral schemes, have informed commissioning guidance from NHS England, the College of Optometrists and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, and NHS Improvement \[5.1\].  As a result, these outputs have played a major role in building the business case for Local Optical Committees \(LOCs\) to influence the decisions of Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\) to adopt MECS and GRFS pathways. The director of commissioning strategy for South East London CCG has commented “ *The CCG and the City team have directly supported more than 20 CCGs to implement their own schemes, but know that the work that we did has become almost standard practice for the whole of the NHS, and has been cited as the exemplar model by the Royal National Institute of Blind People.*” \[5.2\]. 

 <ins> **Minor Eye Conditions S</ins><ins>ervice</ins><ins>s**</ins> 

 The percentage of LOC regions in England that operate a MECS has increased from 55% to 71% since 2015. Over the same period an additional 4,000 optometrists have undertaken MECS accreditation. The commissioning of MECS significantly impacts referral rates from primary to secondary care, reducing the 1.7 million first attendances at ophthalmology outpatient departments by at least 10%. This is the equivalent of 170,000 HES appointments, representing net savings of GBP5,500,000. 

 In 2017, the Royal National Institute of Blind People, in partnership with Specsavers, the largest chain of optical practices in the UK, hosted a series of policy roundtable discussions at which a range of experts including patients, health professionals and commissioners came together to explore how improving delivery in eye care services could help increase capacity. Research from the ESEP was used as evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost\-effectiveness of MECS \[5.3\]. In 2016, Specsavers announced that more than 2000 of its optometrist employees have successfully become accredited to offer MECS in England \[5.4\], a strategic decision underpinned by our research \[5.5\]. 

 <ins> **Community\-based</ins> <ins>G</ins><ins>laucoma</ins> <ins>R</ins><ins>eferral</ins> <ins>F</ins><ins>iltering</ins> <ins>Services**</ins> 

 Our research has also demonstrated the clinical effectiveness and cost\-effectiveness of glaucoma referral filtering services \(GRFS\) in reducing referrals and freeing capacity in glaucoma clinics. The NICE guideline committee for glaucoma, which included ESEP team member *Fenerty,* recommended that *‘people planning eye care services should consider commissioning referral\-filtering services \(for example, repeat measures, enhanced case\-finding, or referral refinement\) for chronic open angle glaucoma and related conditions’* \[5.6\]. Commissioning guidance has also noted “ *Independent monitoring of patients with a diagnosis of glaucoma \(which must be established by a consultant ophthalmologist\) is permitted and encouraged by NICE for those optometrists and other HCPs with training, skills and experience to the level of the CoO \[College of Optometrists\] Professional Diploma in Glaucoma*” \[5.7\]. The NICE recommendation was informed by the findings of ESEP and previous research on referral refinement by members of the City team. 

 <ins> **Clinical Management Guidelines**</ins> 

 Underpinned by research over the past 10 years in priority areas of eye care, *Lawrenson* and *Buckley* have been engaged by the College of Optometrists through academic consultancy to lead on the development of Clinical Management Guidelines \(CMGs\) for the diagnosis and management of a range of eye conditions that present with varying frequency in primary and first contact care. A comprehensive process of identifying and rating the quality of evidence on the management of over 60 conditions and making specific treatment recommendations underpins each guideline \(updated biennially\) \[5.8\]. The Commission for Human Medicines \(CHM\) used the CMGs in their consideration of the proposal to allow optometrists to train as Independent Prescribers. They were also instrumental in the decision by the CHM to recommend that suitably qualified optometrist independent prescribers could prescribe any licensed medicine \(for conditions affecting the eye, and the tissues surrounding the eye, within their recognised area of expertise and competence\). The CMGs therefore have significant ongoing impact because they continue to inform the content of the Common Final Assessment for Independent Prescribing, the accreditation assessment conducted by the College of Optometrists for entry into the specialist register of therapeutic prescribers \[5.9\]. There are now over 500 practising optometrist independent prescribers working in specialist hospital settings and in the community.  The CMG pages account for 22% of all unique page views to the College of Optometrists’ website \(2,284,305 unique page views to the website and 502,387 to CMG pages in the year 2018\-19\). 

 The CMGs are also written into the service specifications for MECS pathways by the Local Optical Committee Support Unit \(LOCSU\), the Northern Ireland Primary Eyecare Assessment and Referral Scheme \(PEARS\) and, more recently, the national service framework for COVID\-19 Urgent Eyecare Services \(CUES\) \[5.10\]. CUES acted as urgent eye care community hubs during the coronavirus pandemic. The quality of the guidelines has been recognised, and they inform the management of eye conditions by optometrists and other primary healthcare professionals e.g. CMGs are referenced in BMJ Evidence and NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries \(for GPs\) \[5.11\].

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Judith McKenzie directed three strands of work related to the architecture and artistic forms in the ancient Mediterranean world: the Khirbet et\-Tannur Nabataean Temple Project, analysis of the Garima Gospels, and development of the Manar al\-Athar open\-access photo\-archive.  Her unexpected death in May 2019 resulted in the final stages of planned work being overseen by others and to some changes in direction. 

 Khirbet et\-Tannur is a hilltop temple \(2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE–4/6<sup>th</sup> century CE\) 70 km north of Petra in Jordan, with a local design but classical architectural sculpture. The site was excavated in 1937, but the excavator’s reports were never published and the non\-sculptural finds were never assessed or published. The project, using an international team directed by McKenzie, analyzed the material and published the results. McKenzie’s work on the project was supported by a British Academy Small Research Grant. Two volumes of *The Nabataean Temple at Khirbet et\-Tannur*, published in 2013 **\[R1 and 2\]**, reported exceptionally well\-preserved carbonized cult offerings and vessels, which provided a unique insight into ancient religious practice. The reports provide new information directly relevant to understanding the religion, history, and culture of the Hellenistic and Roman East. 

 The Garima Gospels are the earliest surviving Ethiopian gospel books, and include lavishly illustrated canon tables and portraits of the Evangelists. In 2015, the first joint analysis of the texts and images was undertaken by McKenzie and Biblical text scholar Francis Watson \(Durham University\). The resulting publication, *The Garima Gospels* \(2016\) **\[R3\]**, demonstrated how a distinctively Ethiopian Christian art and culture developed in the 6<sup>th</sup> century CE, and set these developments within the broader context of late antiquity. 

 Under McKenzie’s direction, a volume of essays on the Ge‘ez collections of the Bodleian Libraries, *The Treasures of Ethiopia and Eritrea* \(2019\) **\[R4\]**, was edited by Jacopo Gnisci. The publication was completed as part of the ERC Advanced Grant ‘Monumental Art of the Christian and Early Islamic East: Cultural Identities and Classical Heritage’ \(PI: McKenzie\). Following McKenzie’s death, an exhibition and related outreach activities in collaboration with the Bodleian Libraries were seen to completion by Gnisci. As a result of interest generated by these activities, the first ever catalogue of the Juel\-Jensen collection of Ge‘ez manuscripts in the Bodleian Libraries is now being prepared by Gnisci and Dorothea Reule \(University of Hamburg\). The Manar al\-Athar open\-access photo\-archive **\[R5\]** provides freely available high\-resolution, searchable images of archaeological sites, buildings and art in the regions of the Roman Empire which subsequently came under Islamic rule. The archive is used for teaching, research, publication, and heritage work. Initial development, by McKenzie in collaboration with Neil McLynn \(Classics, Oxford\), was supported by the Leverhulme Trust \(2011–2016\), and further development was supported by a British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grant \(PI: McKenzie\), and the ERC Advanced Grant “Monumental Art of the Christian and Early Islamic East: Cultural Identities and Classical Heritage” \(2016–2020\) \(PI: McKenzie\). Development of the photo\-archive has continued following McKenzie’s death, overseen by Ine Jacobs \(Archaeology, Classics and History, Oxford\) and Elizabeth Macaulay\-Lewis \(The Graduate Center, the City University of New York\). In October 2020, the photo\-archive had c. 76 000 photographs, from more than forty contributors, online, including photographs of structures subsequently damaged by development and/or conflict.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Documentation and preservation of cultural heritage** 

 Manar al\-Athar **\[R5\]** resources have been used by government agencies and NGOs to document endangered heritage. The photo\-archive is one of six resources listed by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan as being useful to researchers working on the history and archaeology of the region **\[E1\]** and its photographs have been used by the Petra National Trust \(Jordan\) as a baseline for monitoring site degradation, with the Petra National Trust \(PNT\) President commenting: ‘\[Manar al\-Athar\] has been invaluable in our efforts to document changes over time in the archaeological landscape of Petra and other sites in Jordan. We have used the database…for our advocacy efforts to promote the preservation and sustainable use of the site’ **\[E2\]**. 

 In 2018, sculptural pieces from Khirbet et\-Tannur were obtained by an art dealer from the estate of a Spanish diplomat and collector. While they are known to have been held in Jordan for a period during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it remains unclear how they left the country and came to be in Spain. McKenzie was instrumental in their return to Jordan where they will be displayed in the Jordan Museum. Her Royal Highness Princess Dana Firas said: ‘We are grateful to Dr Judith McKenzie and Diego López de Aragón for their collaboration and their critical role in repatriating these important pieces to Jordan. This outcome stands as a successful example of cooperation among governments, the private sector, and civil society to honor the country\-origin of archaeological pieces.’ **\[E3.2\]** 

 **Cultural heritage education** 

 A booklet, *‘A Gem of a Small Nabataean Temple*’, prepared under McKenzie’s direction by Marlena Whiting \(Classics, Oxford, 2014–2015\) and Hannah Wellman \(PhD student, University of Oregon\), provides general information on Khirbet et\-Tannur for students, tourists and the public. The booklet, in English \(2016\) and Arabic \(2018, translated by Diana Sayegh\), is freely available online.  Copies of the Arabic version were provided to the PNT for use in their Education and Engagement Program. The Trust’s Education, Outreach and Awareness Manager commented that the programme: ‘targets children in the communities surrounding the Petra Site, and aims to instil a sense of identity and pride in Petra’s cultural and natural heritage, and inspire a commitment to preserving and protecting Petra’s significance and values. Prof. McKenzie’s research has been included in the instructor’s kit for the age groups of \(7\-9\) and \(10\-12\)’ **\[E4\]** 

 Users from c.100 countries have accessed Manar al\-Athar since 2017, with approximately 18% of users located in MENA countries. Arabic/English labelling has made Manar al\-Athar’s images widely accessible in this region, with the PNT President commenting: ‘Very few academic or teaching resources are available in both a European and non\-European language …The Manar al\-Athar database is a useful resource for university students in Jordan’, and that ‘I have also received letters from schoolteachers \[in Jordan\] acknowledging the value of the Manar al\-Athar database for their teaching’ **\[E2\].** Manar al\-Athar has an active presence on Twitter, sharing the cultural heritage of MENA countries and its endangered status with non\-academic audiences. The account averages more than 100,000 impressions per month and responses to it include: ‘one of the most fascinating I’ve come across’ **\[E5\]**. 

 **Widening audience engagement** 

 More than 1,000 people attended the photo\-exhibition, ""The Hidden Gospels of Abba Garima, Treasures of the Ethiopian Highlands"", based on *The Garima Gospels* **\[R3\].** The exhibition, held at the Faculty of Classics \(5 November 2016–12 April 2017\), was curated by McKenzie, Foteini Spingou \(Classics, Oxford, 2016–2018\) and Miranda Williams \(Classics, Oxford\). 84% of those who signed the exhibition guestbook left comments, indicating a high level of engagement. Comments emphasised that the exhibition had made academic research accessible to the public: ‘An enthralling exhibition, a wonderful thing to share with town and general public, beautifully explained’ **\[E6\]**. 

 Research on the Garima Gospels led to the Bodleian Libraries’ first community co\-curated exhibition, ‘Languages of God: Sacred Scripts of Ethiopia and Eritrea’ \(Weston Library, 27 July 2019–13 October 2019\) **\[R4\]** and to related community\-involved outreach events. The community co\-curation project involved members of the Ethiopian and Eritrean communities from Oxford, London and Milton Keynes. Written feedback was appreciative: ‘The co\-curation project offered opportunities to bring people of Ethiopian and Eritrean origins to work together on a common cultural heritage, and to inspire the young generation from these communities to know more about the languages and religious and historical literature of their ancestors’ **\[E7\].** 

 An ‘Ethiopian Manuscript Discovery Day’ at the Weston Library in July 2018 \(organized by the Bodleian Libraries, in collaboration with McKenzie\), and a study day at the Faculty of Classics in September 2018 \(organized by McKenzie, Gnisci and Miranda Williams\), drew community involvement, and community awareness of, and interest in, Ethiopian and Eritrean Christianity and Ge‘ez. Surveys conducted at these events indicated that 69% and 74% of respondents, respectively, were likely to find out more about Ethiopian and Eritrean Christianity; and 62% and 69%, respectively, were likely to find out more about Ge‘ez script **\[E7\]**. 

 These events raised community awareness of African manuscripts held by British libraries \(70% of survey respondents at the ‘Discovery Day’ had previously been unaware that the Bodleian Libraries held Ge‘ez manuscripts\) **\[E7\]**, and contributed to debate on the position of African artefacts held by British institutions. An article in *Toward a Global Middle Ages* \(2019\), noted: ‘In other cases, the exhibitions have set aside the history of the acquisitions, focusing instead …on the contemporary connections of the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora in England to the cultural patrimony now held in British institutions \(in the case of the Bodleian\)’ **\[E8\]**. 

 A trustee of the Ethiopian Heritage Fund, a British charity committed to promoting Ethiopia’s artistic heritage, conveyed a copy of *The Garima Gospels* **\[R3\]** to the Monastery of Abba Garima in Ethiopia and reported that: ‘we met with the Abbott \[sic\] and the Treasurer to hand over the book. They were thrilled and told me that it would be made available to visitors’ **\[E9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Keele’s Virtual 3D Artefact Reconstruction and Interaction software and systems comprise novel interactive web\-based 3D artefact interfaces, a low\-cost portable 3D acquisition system with automated workflow, a joining algorithm for virtual artefact reconstruction \(from previous research\) and novel Augmented Reality \(AR\) museum apps for creating interactive 3D artefact exhibitions. The software and systems have impacts in Assyriology, archaeology, digital heritage, outreach and public engagement. They have been used to virtualise 3D photo\-realistic museum artefacts, via online interactive interfaces and AR apps, that would not otherwise be accessible, and have been used to achieve the world’s first long\-distance virtual artefact reconstruction that joined together fragments of the famous Atrahasis epic, held 1000km apart in Geneva and in The British Museum. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Within the scope of the impact case the research is underpinned by software and systems that support: 

-  3D acquisition of photo\-realistic artefact models 

-  web\-based interactive visualisation software 

-  AR apps 

 The research is also underpinned by a 3D algorithm that automates fragment joining \(developed pre\-2016 at Birmingham University\). 

 The original motivation for the research was to enable virtual access to, and virtual reconstruction of, the many thousands of cuneiform tablets and fragments that are distributed across international collections. Prior to joining Keele, Woolley led the original seed\-funded digitisation research at Birmingham \(published in the first paper on 3D\-acquisition of cuneiform SPIE.2001.4298.103\-10\) and was co\-investigator on two Assyriological and Archaeological Leverhulme Trust awards, evolving collaborative reconstruction. Following Woolley’s arrival at Keele \(2016\), an international interdisciplinary collaboration \(Computer Science: Woolley, Nottingham Ningbo NVIDIA Lab, China: Ch’ng; Electronic Engineering: Manchester Met: Collins; Assyriology: Institut für Archäologische Wissenschaften, Goethe\-Universität Frankfurt, Germany: Gehlken\) started work on the wider technologies that form this impact case and established The Virtual Cuneiform Tablet Reconstruction \(VCTR\) Project and accompanying website \( [virtualcuneiform.org](https://virtualcuneiform.org/)\). 

 Cuneiform script is one of the earliest systems of writing, used in Mesopotamia and beyond for over 3000 years, from c. 3000 BCE. Made from handheld clay ‘tablets’ \( **3.1**\) using a reed stylus to form wedge\-shaped impressions, the tablets were *the* original portable information technology \( **3.2**\). Many thousands of tablets and fragments are held in museum archives and collections worldwide. Few of these artefacts are on display and access is limited, even to Assyriological scholars. Where artefacts are on display, only one side of the writing is usually visible. 

 The epic of Atrahasis \(a creation and flood story predating Judæo\-Christian texts\) is one of the most significant examples of Mesopotamian literature \( **3.3, 3.4**\). For over fifty years, one fragment of the third and final cuneiform tablet of the epic, held in Geneva, had been believed to join with another held in London. However, due to their 1000 km separation, the join had never been physically tested \( **3.4**\). In 2017, the team acquired 3D models of both fragments \(using their photogrammetric acquisition system \( **3.5**\)\) and verified and evidenced the match via the automated virtual join algorithm \( **3.3, 3.4**\). 

 The technologies developed through this research have achieved significant advances in virtual artefact reconstruction, 3D interactions and low\-cost portable photogrammetric acquisition \(with a synchronised turntable and camera/smartphone supported by an automated processing workflow\) at sufficient resolution for virtual reconstruction, the alternative is costly or immobile, using laser or structured light scanners \( **3.5**\). In addition to joining the Atrahasis tablet fragments, the technology was also used to acquire almost 100 cuneiform tablet fragments from the study loan collection at The British Museum, and for the joining of two pairs. Exemplars of these fragment models are included on the VCTR website gallery via the interactive 3D viewer and in a join interaction \(popularly accessed by schools\). 

 Subsequent research has evolved the visualisation software and added Android and iPhone augmented\-reality apps \( **3.6**\) that allow acquired virtual 3D models \(and related information\) to be viewed, arranged and manipulated. The team is developing an archive of 3D models \(including non\-cuneiform artefact fragments from local and national museums\) as the basis for a range of educational and cultural outreach activities, and working with museums, citizens and scholars to create innovative and interactive designs.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has engaged new audiences, delivered new virtual artefact interactions and reconstructions, provided scholars with a means of quantifying and verifying joins, and has ‘unlocked cuneiform’ by supporting virtual 3D access to artefacts that are not normally accessible without specialised hardware or software. 

 **Impact in virtual artefact interaction and reconstruction** 

 VCTR interactive outputs can support museums to design and curate virtual, physical, augmented and blended reality exhibitions \( **3.6**\) that democratise collections, enable access to artefacts, and provide presence for repatriated and loaned objects. The joining algorithm, incorporated in VCTR, uses a novel algorithm that handles the incompleteness of broken 3D surfaces, which was critical in joining degraded cuneiform tablets. 

  

 Evolving from the interactive 3D viewers the team developed Android and iPhone AR apps to allow virtual museum artefacts to be collected and arranged. This work was inspired by conversations with the Lead Curator of Antiquities at National Museums Liverpool \(World Museum\), who sought a virtual replacement for the Shabti of Padineith whilst it was on loan to the Florence Nightingale Museum. The AR app enables users to interact with artefacts and to view them either as fragments or as reconstructions \( **3.6**\). 

  

 **Impact in Assyriology and archaeology** 

 The research team used the VCTR toolset on artefacts held at The British Museum; Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva; and National Museums Liverpool. The most significant impact to date is the first remote artefact reconstruction, joining fragments of the famous Atrahasis epic held in Geneva and The British Museum \( **5.2,** **5.7**\). Acquisitions were made using the 3D photogrammetric acquisition systems developed as part of the VCTR toolset \( **3.5**\), one of which was adapted for the large British Museum tablet \( **5.7**\). Other tablet reconstructions are reported in key Assyriological outlets: the Nouvelles Assyriologiques Brèves et Utilitaires \(NABU 2014 \(4\), 119\-120\) and Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale conferences \(“From Uruk to Ur: Automated Matching of Virtual Tablet Fragments” 2016 and 2017: **3.4**\). In addition, joins have been made for flint fragments provided by Bradford University and investigations are on\-going into the joining of archaeological cast fragments from statues lost in antiquity provided by the Katholische Universität Eichstätt\-Ingolstadt in Bavaria \( **5.8**\). 

 Virtualisation and reconstruction of cuneiform tablets has the potential to provide scholars with new, accessible insights into the social, political, religious, scientific and historical aspects of [ ](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/world-history-beginnings/ancient-mesopotamia/a/mesopotamia-article)Mesopotamian culture \( **5.6**\- **5.9**\). The VCTR project has been mentioned on the Ancient World Online \(AWOL\) blog and tweeted by curators at The British Museum and Penn State as well as Harvard and Leiden researchers \( **5.6**\). 

 The VCTR 3D viewer has been successfully integrated into the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative \(CDLI:  [https://cdli.ucla.edu/](https://cdli.ucla.edu/)\), a joint project with UCLA, University of Oxford, and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin \( **5.10**\). The CDLI curates and publishes a searchable international digital repository of cuneiform artefacts, including hand\-drawn sketches, photographs, reflectance transformation imaging views, transcriptions and translations. The VCTR 3D viewer provides an interactive interface designed for artefact manipulation and 3D script reading and has been successfully implemented with VCTR\-derived 3D models into the current CDLI framework \( **5.10**\). Additionally, the latest version of the VCTR 3D viewer will be fully integrated into the new CDLI framework that is currently in development \( **5.10**\). 

 **Engaging new audiences** 

 Cuneiform and virtual reconstruction have been introduced to new audiences locally and globally \( **5.1**\). The work has been published in the media through a 2018 Conversation article \( **5.2**\) \(7,500 reads, including the UK, US, Australia and France\) and republished in the European Union News \(01/03/2018\), reported in a German national newspaper \( **5.3**\), and presented in a German radio documentary \( **5.4**\).  The team has taken the VCTR 3D digital artefacts and exhibits to outreach events including Potteries Museum “Night of Science” \(28.09.18\) \(1600 visitors\), and a Pint of Science talk \(“Virtual archaeology and ancient beer\)” \(21.05.19\) \( **5.5**\). 

 Also, audiences have engaged with the research through the VCTR project website. The software used to link fragments \( **3.3**\) is demonstrated on the website \( **5.1**\), allowing users to virtually join fragments and to experience the difficulties faced in attempting to identify joining surfaces \( **5.1**\). Between 2016 and 2020, the website had an average of 2000 visitors per week \(90.9% are first\-time visitors to the VCTR\), from the UK, Spain, Germany, France and USA \( **5.2**\). 

 Reviews of website analytics showed US schools accessing the website \( **5.1**\). This prompted development of educational resources and the creation of a Schools Workshop \( **5.5**\). The first workshop ran for 147 year 8 pupils at a Staffordshire school \(06.02.19\). Children explored joining cuneiform fragments and other 3D museum artefacts. Students suggested improvements that were incorporated into the evolved VCTR tools and 3D viewer \( **5.6**\). Following the workshop, students reported an improved understanding of 3D models and an increased interest in computer science \(50% for girls and 32% for boys\). 

 Several public engagement and research events were cancelled due to the COVID\-19 outbreak. These included a contribution to an exhibition at National Museums Liverpool; a school engagement event and two interactions at the July 2020 BCS Human\-Computer Interaction Conference Interaction Gallery. However, overall, ambitions were achieved, for example, via contribution at the European Digital Heritage Conference \(November 2020\) \( **3.6**\) and via the development of AR apps and web pages.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Lesley Henderson’s sociological research on communicating plastic pollution addresses the problem of public understandings and behaviour change. It has influenced industry practice and informed policy development in relation to \(micro\)plastics communications. Her research has been used to prioritise the cultural context of plastics use, media framing of the problem and role of communications in behaviour change. This has influenced European regulation \(SAPEA\) and EU policy \(Circular Economy Action Plan\) and led to Ursula von der Leyen making plastic\-free oceans a ‘cross\-cutting priority’ for the European Commission in 2019. Dr Henderson’s work has also informed business and plastic industry approaches. \[REDACTED\] 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impact stems from a body of research that Dr Henderson has developed over the past 20 years at Brunel University London in relation to health, science and political communications. At the core of her research is the relationship between communications and social change \(Ref. 1\-4; Grant 1\-5\). 

 **Between 2000 and 2001, Dr Henderson \(then, Lecturer\) examined media representations of human genetic research. She found that media values of drama and personalisation can undermine scientific accuracy, amplifying ‘breakthroughs’ and creating misconceptions amongst audiences about risk to human health.** Her work highlighted how 'science reporting' is firmly embedded within broader socio\-economic issues and how political and economic factors may drive a science story. This has provided crucial insights into the key relationships which influence media reporting of scientific research \(Grant 1\). 

 **During 2003, Dr Henderson explored reasons for low childhood immunisation amongst the Orthodox Jewish community in North East London. She identified the importance of ‘word of mouth’ networks and that media myths about the risk of vaccination may play a greater role than expected in marginalised communities \(Ref. 1\).** 

 Between 2006 and 2009, Dr Henderson \(then, Senior Lecturer\) led the audience reception strand of a project which explored the debates about the ‘state of youth’ in the UK and EU regarding public alienation from the political process. The research identified disaffection from formal politics as presented on mainstream media and a desire for more authentic depictions of young people. The findings showed how perceptions of ‘fakery’ can reduce levels of trust and engagement in expertise and recognised a desire for political messaging from more ‘trusted’ figures, such as comedians, who were seen as ‘neutral’ figures without an agenda \(Grant 2\). 

 Between 2016 and 2017, Dr Henderson led an interdisciplinary project mapping media stories and audience engagement with plastics pollution using news bulletins and the documentary film *A Plastic Ocean* \(Netflix, 2017\), endorsed by David Attenborough and Leonardo Di Caprio for promoting an anti single\-use plastic message. Dr Henderson found that emotive images of plastics were powerful and raised awareness, but low public scientific literacy meant people made little connection between their everyday actions and plastics in the ocean. She attributed this to media framing which links plastic pollution to wildlife entanglement and promotes myths about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Dr Henderson found strongly held societal perceptions regarding “good health” \(e.g. ‘plastic straws protect teeth’\) and assumptions about “good parenting” \(e.g. ‘plastic balloons are normal for birthday celebrations’\) which can undermine circular economy messages \(reuse, recycle, retain, refuse\) \(Grant 3; Ref. 4\). 

 In 2020, Dr Henderson went on Knowledge Transfer Leave to strengthen further the evidence base for the impact her research has had on plastic pollution. She engaged with industry \[REDACTED\] and policymakers \(European Commission, OSPAR, World Health Organisation\) to shape interventions for bridging the gap between education and human behaviour which resulted in more effective plastic waste management.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Henderson has made contributions to European policy options as a member of the SAPEA Working Group on microplastics. SAPEA \(Science Advice for Policy by European Academies\) is part of the European Commission’s Scientific Advice Mechanism that provides independent advice to the European Commission for planning and policy\-making. Because of her expertise in communications, risk and public behaviours, Dr Henderson was the only sociologist invited to be a member of the Working Group on microplastics, which included 26 colleagues \(comprising natural scientists; environmental psychologists; social scientists; policy makers\). Together, they produced a report \(Report 1\) which concludes that ‘evidence on microplastics does not yet point to widespread risk’ however warns that ‘the situation could change if pollution continues at the current rate.’ It was presented to the European Group of Chief Scientific Advisors \(GCSA\) in January 2019 who have fully accepted the recommendations from the report. 

 **I. <ins>Impact on the European Commission and Changes to the Risk Perception of Microplastics**</ins> 

 An independent expert report published by the European Commission in February 2020 refers to the outcome of the SAPEA Evidence Review Report and the activities of the European Commission’s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors both of which Henderson’s research influenced. The report corroborates that the data presented in the SAPEA report, “made recommendations on how the EU, together with other global policy actors, should respond to microplastic pollution based on state\-of\-the\-art scientific knowledge and insights” \(E1\). It confirms that the SAPEA report “has informed a number of debates both within the scientific community and among policy\-makers, including roundtable meetings of G7 Chief Scientific Advisors on Scientific Advice cooperation for microplastic pollution in Washington DC… and in Paris… and has strengthened international cooperation between Chief Scientific Advisors” \(E1\). 

 The Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation commended the report: “with the rise of microplastics pollution, we need to understand how microplastics interact with people and planet, so we can take action…The recommendations of the Advisors provide clarity on what we can and should do now, and what we need to know and how we can find it out in order to act later. The Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries was equally impressed: “the recommendations complement work already set in motion by the European Plastics Strategy. They will help us in our continued efforts to provide the highest standards of protection of public health and the environment, through sustainable management of plastics” \(E2\). 

 The European Commission report has also informed the ECHA proposal January 2019 to restrict intentionally added microplastics. Currently, “the releases of intentionally added microplastics in the EU/EEA are estimated to be around 42000 \[ *sic*\] tonnes a year. Additional releases from infill material used in artificial turf pitches could amount to 16,000 \[ *sic*\] tonnes per year. The proposed restriction would prevent more than 90% of these releases, or 500,000 \[ *sic*\] tonnes of microplastic releases over a 20\-year period” \(E3\). 

 The SAPEA report was also responsible for the point made by Ursula von der Leyen in her mission statement to the Commissioner\-designate for Environment and Oceans in September 2019. She ordered the Commissioner, “As part of \[the new Circular Economy Action Plan\], you will lead efforts towards plastic\-free oceans. I want you to address the issue of microplastics and ensure that the existing legislation on plastics is implemented” \(E4\). In the mission letter, von der Leyen labels this as part of the “cross\-cutting priorities” which will contribute to “conserving Europe’s natural environment” \(E4\). This statement demonstrates a shift in priorities at the top\-level of the EU, as a direct result of Henderson’s research contribution to the report. 

 The report has also reached international levels. It had a strong influence on the WHO report “ [Microplastics in drinking\-water](https://www.sapea.info/sapea-evidence-review-helps-shape-new-who-microplastics-report/)”; was cited in “The Ocean As a Solution to Climate Change”; discussed at the high level panel for a sustainable ocean economy \(involving presidents/prime ministers of Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal\), and was discussed by G7 science advisors at a meeting in Washington DC. The panel concluded, “The fact that we can also share findings from sociological research on the effects of ocean pollution on humans and society shows that interdisciplinary, joint efforts by the natural and social sciences to tackle these global problems are increasingly perceived and appreciated by politicians and donors alike” \(E5\). 

 \[REDACTED\] 

 The chair of the SAPEA Working Group acknowledged the importance of communication as emphasised by Dr Henderson, noting “a lack of evidence for risk doesn’t mean we should assume that there is no risk. As our social science colleagues have pointed out, it’s vital that we communicate clearly about uncertainties in the evidence, rather than just assuming that everything is fine just because we don’t know for sure” \(E8\).
