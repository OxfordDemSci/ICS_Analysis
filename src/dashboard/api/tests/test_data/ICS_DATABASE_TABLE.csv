##  1. Summary of the impact 

 First\-of\-its\-kind ‘index price’ insurance designed by Liverpool mathematicians is heralded by Sky News, Reuters and the current Environment Secretary as a market first. The new product has created commercial and economic benefits in the insurance, food and farming sectors in the UK, Netherlands and the US. The Liverpool pricing algorithms, developed to establish start\-up business Stable Group Ltd, have enabled the company to attract market authorisation and venture capital investment, create jobs and generate sales revenue. This insurance is providing food and farming businesses with protection from volatile market prices for the first time: 

-  First ever price insurance approved by global underwriters Lloyd’s of London. 

-  Backed by USD6,000,000 \(03\-2019\) venture capital. 

-  21 jobs created in London, Amsterdam and Chicago. 

-  Turnover of GBP1,200,000, protecting GBP22,000,000 of risk to food security.

##  2. Underpinning research 

###  2.1. The problem of price volatility 

 Price volatility is one of the biggest risks for the global food and farming industry. Farming income is inherently volatile due to natural disasters such as floods, political shocks such as Brexit and demand/supply \(negative\) shocks such as the Covid\-19 outbreak. Prices can swing by as much as 30% each year. Existing risk management tools such as derivatives and options are complex, risky and expensive. This makes them inaccessible to nearly all small and medium size farms. 

###  2.2. A new solution – index insurance 

 Dr Assa is a lecturer in the Institute of Financial and Actuarial Mathematics, Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Liverpool. The novelty in this body of work on index insurances by Dr Assa is in creating a brand new risk management platform as a legitimate replacement of derivatives for managing volatile prices. Index\-based insurance \- where payouts are linked to some ‘index’ rather than actual losses \- is an accessible solution for farmers. Firstly there is no claims process and users cannot lose more than they invest; insurances are heavily regulated and cannot be used for speculation \- users can only insure what they have; and finally they remove the risk of ‘moral hazard’ \(deliberate exposure to risk\) as they are based on independent indexes. By taking this different perspective, Dr Assa introduced and developed insurances on index <ins>prices</ins> for the first time. He found that insurances on index prices \(compared with derivatives\) needed the development of completely new financial mathematical frameworks in order to estimate volatility and price the risk. This is due to a lack of suitable data \(implied, realised volatility methods\) and issues with underestimation \(empirical volatility methods\) in applying traditional techniques. The novel mathematical framework Dr Assa constructed was an equilibrium solution to estimate volatility in order to price the risk. 

###  2.3. Developing index insurance 

 Between 2014 and 2019 Dr Assa developed these new insurance methodologies on index prices and applied them to problems in agriculture **\[3.1, 3.2,** and particularly **3.3\]**. These publications form the fundamentals of the agricultural index price insurances used by Stable Group Ltd. The research outlines a complete framework, from theoretical feasibility to priced insurances. Due to the novelty of these products, **\[3.3\]** investigates the attractiveness of such new markets from both insurer and insured perspectives. During this time, Dr Assa also collaborated with Liverpool mathematicians Dr Athanasios Pantelous and Dr Nikolaos Karagiannis, and Prof Turvey of Cornell University \(USA\) on a novel ‘over the counter’ insurance contract on catastrophe risk **\[3.4\]**. Specifically, Dr Assa designed and priced a risk bond related to agricultural catastrophes \(AgriCATs\), transferring the risk of an agriculture\-related catastrophe to a hedge\-fund rather than the insurers themselves. 

###  2.4. New index insurance for industry 

 This body of research demonstrated how optimal insurance contracts on agricultural price indexes can be designed and how risk capital investment can make agricultural insurance financially viable, creating a pathway to designing and pricing index insurance contracts in the real\-world. By 2016 Dr Assa and his PhD student Simon Wang were obtaining results for the Stable team directly, solving the problem of systemic \(undistributed\) risk in agriculture markets; for example if the price of milk falls in Yorkshire, it also falls in Somerset **\[3.3\]**. They applied machine learning to over seventy years of UK government index prices, to price the risk of a price fall and dynamically allocate capital across 12 different commodities \(products\) to distribute risk. Payouts are made based on the difference between insured price levels and independent price indexes set by third parties such as the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board \(AHDB\). This model was applicable to price risk in the UK in the first instance, founding an insurance platform that would act like a mixed farm by spreading risk across many commodities. 

 This research was supported by a grant from the Montreal Institute of Structured Finance and Derivatives \(Canada\).

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Heralded by Reuters **\[5.1a\]** and Sky News **\[5.1b\]** in 2019 as a market first, new index price insurance developed by mathematicians at the University of Liverpool is benefitting insurance, farming and food businesses: “ *Farmers can now for the first time insure their produce against price volatility as easily as insuring their homes*” \(Reuters\) **\[5.1a\]**. One farmer reports that market price swings can mean GBP300,000 of lost income **\[5.2\]**. Losses can be even greater during major demand/supply shocks such as the GBP13,000,000 \(01\-05\-2020\) loss to UK dairy farms in just one month during the Covid\-19 pandemic. Existing risk management tools \(designed for financiers\) are inaccessible to most farmers due to high cost, risk and complexity. Technology start\-up Stable Group Ltd uses algorithms developed by Dr Assa and his group **\[3.3\]**, providing unparalleled financial security to over 140 food and farming businesses for the first time **\[5.3\]**. **This is the first product to provide widely available protection from fluctuating prices and is the only price insurance to be backed by underwriters Lloyd’s of London in its 330 year history \[5.3, 5.4\]**. 

###  4.1. Food security – policyholders 

 Using insurance pricing models developed at Liverpool, Stable is stabilising cash flow for producers and buyers of agricultural products. At June 2020, Stable had covered a total of GBP22,000,000 risk for 140 food and farming businesses **\[5.3\]**. This is the maximum amount payable to policyholders against insurance policies sold. The protection makes businesses more credit worthy, protects profits and empowers them to invest in the future. A Norfolk farmer explains how Stable’s “ *innovative way of doing things”* is *“a definite advantage*” and is “ *much easier to manage*” than the futures \(derivatives\) market **\[5.2\]**. In its first year of trading, Stable paid 40% of its total sales revenue directly back to farmers in automated payouts **\[5.3\]**. For example, one arable farmer received net benefits \(payouts\) totalling GBP32,000 **\[5.3\]**. In addition to protecting farmers from falling prices, Stable is also protecting a growing pipeline of food purchasing businesses from the rising costs of vital ingredients. One drinks producer has protected itself against EUR1,500,000 \(06\-2020\) of price risk associated with fresh apples **\[5.3\]**. 

###  4.2. New start\-up business 

 Richard Counsell, a farmer and technology entrepreneur, now CEO of Stable Group Ltd, came across Dr Assa’s research in 2015, with particular interest in **\[3.4\]**. Throughout 2016 the pair scoped the concept of index\-based price insurance for the agricultural sector. By 2017 Counsell formally contracted Dr Assa and the University of Liverpool to design an insurance platform that would act like a mixed farm, spreading risk across many commodities \(products\) **\[5.3\]**. Dr Assa’s group developed algorithms that could read and analyse price data, and a machine\-learning engine that analysed trillions of prices and dates to forecast trends and look for diversification opportunities **\[3.3\]**. Stable CEO Mr Counsell explains: “… *you built new mathematical frameworks to estimate volatility and price risk that continue to underpin our company’s entire concept and insurance methodology…Your work provided a ground breaking new insurance solution to tackle a global problem and established Stable as the only provider of index price insurance in the world…The algorithms you developed for us enabled the company to attract investors and underwriters in order to begin trading. Ours was the first ever price insurance to be approved by global underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, proving market feasibility of the new platform*” **\[5.3\]**. 

 Following three years of R&D with Dr Assa, Stable launched publicly in March 2019 with Liverpool’s alumnus Dr Simon Wang as a Director **\[5.5\]**. From the original twelve indexes that Dr Assa developed to establish the concept, Stable now has more than 3,000 indexes in over 40 countries, all developed using the same pioneering mathematical framework for estimating volatility and pricing risk **\[5.3\]**. Total sales at June 2020 were GBP1,200,000 **\[5.3\]**. Stable has 21 employees \(headcount\) consisting of highly skilled data scientists, analysts and actuaries across their London headquarters and Amsterdam and Chicago sales offices. Dr Assa remains their Scientific Advisor **\[5.3, 5.6a\]**. 

###  4.3. Insurance sector 

 External investment in Stable demonstrates sector confidence in and market feasibility of Dr Assa’s index price algorithms, as well as a new business opportunity for these partners. 

 **Underwriters:** All insurance policies priced using the Liverpool algorithms and issued by Stable are underwritten by global underwriters at Lloyd’s of London **\[5.4\]**. This means that Stable does not have to fund payouts itself. Lloyd’s Coverholder status applies in 50 different countries. Coverholders are a major source of business for Lloyd's and Stable has brought new business to this marketplace, being the only price insurance to be backed in Lloyd’s 330 year history **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. 

 **Investors:** Major international investors Anthemis, Syngenta and Ascot backed Stable in March 2019 with USD6,000,000 \(03\-2019\) venture capital **\[5.1b, 5.3\]**. This is equity\-based funding that investors can sell once the business becomes profitable. The investment put Stable in the top 10 London startups for raising the most capital that month **\[5.7\]**. Investor Anthemis says “ *Stable is bringing a fresh perspective to food security…As investors, we are pleased to back Richard and his team as they tackle this multi\-trillion\-dollar opportunity*.” **\[5.8\]**. 

 **Introducers:** Stable sells policies directly to larger businesses, otherwise their insurance is sold through one of 12 trusted sales partners or ‘introducers’ **\[5.3\]**. Introducers are organisations trusted by the farming industry \(such as member organisations\), who benefit financially through onward sales. One introducer explains: “ *Stable’s simple solution is one that our farmers have been requesting for years. We’re incredibly excited…to help our members protect their income and invest in the future of this vital industry’* **\[5.3\]**. 

 Stable has received 10 industry awards and honours **\[5.9\]**. Stable’s CEO explains “ *This commercial success wouldn’t have been possible without your* \[Dr Assa’s\] *expertise and pricing algorithms”* **\[5.3\]**. Speaking at Stable’s launch in March 2019, a former Farming Minister \(currently Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\) describes the platform as “ *… a remarkable idea, and by neutralising risk* \[for farmers\] *it has identified a way forward*” **\[5.6b\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Tim Lewens and Jesse Olszynko\-Gryn’s work on medical risk and its proper governance has had impact over three areas: 

-  Their work on the Hormonal Pregnancy Test \(HPT\) Primodos was partly responsible for the launch, and subsequent conduct, of an official inquiry into the regulatory handling of these tests. 

-  Lewens’s work on the ethics of medical risk led to his being invited to join AstraZeneca’s new AWERB \(Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body\). He has given training courses for AZ researchers, and has influenced the company’s overall culture of care. 

-  Lewens’s work with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics gave rise to decisive contributions to parliamentary debates on the legalisation of mitochondrial ‘donation’ technologies.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research on medical risk and its proper governance typifies the History and Philosophy of Science Department’s priorities in the areas of history and philosophy of medicine, and its efforts to encourage interdisciplinarity for impact. The impact in question combines Olszynko\-Gryn’s archival historical research with Lewens’s philosophical approach to risk, and draws on networks of scientists, sociologists and patient groups. 

 Olszynko\-Gryn’s research has focused on the history of pregnancy testing in Britain. This began with his \(2014\) PhD thesis, *Pregnancy Testing in Britain*, and has also included a series of essays focused on key episodes relating to the introduction and regulation of hormone pregnancy tests \[R1\]. His academic work on Primodos and other hormone pregnancy tests culminated in an article for which he was first author, which gives a detailed historical analysis of the development, adoption and withdrawal of these tests. These tests have been highly controversial because of strongly held views among patient groups that they caused significant harm to their unborn children \[R2\]. 

 Lewens has had a longstanding interest in the ethics of risk, especially as it plays out in biomedical ethics \[R3\]. His work has addressed the proper understanding of the precautionary principle \[R4\], and the manner in which policy debates around risk need to be handled by both technical experts and those well\-versed in ethical analysis \[R5\]. He has also studied the ways in which different framings of risk\-related information can reflect ethical judgements on the part of speakers \[R5\].His work has often focused on the case study of ‘mitochondrial donation’ technologies, and on other technologies that aim to influence germline inheritance \[R5\], \[R6\].He has argued for the need to take ethical values into account when deliberating over what appear to be purely technical questions about the regulation of scientific work. He has also used these insights as a basis for opposing strong divisions of advisory labour—for example between panels assigned to evaluate scientific questions on the one hand, and ethical questions on the other—when regulators consider how to manage the introduction of new technologies \[R5\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

1.  **Primodos** 

 **Overview: Lewens’s and Olszynko\-Gryn’s work on the Hormonal Pregnancy Test \(HPT\) Primodos contributed to the launch of an official review of the regulatory handling of these tests, and their work informed the deliberations of the official review panel. Key beneficiaries here include the review panel itself, members of the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) dedicated to HPTs, and members of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests.** 

 The Primodos pregnancy test has been the subject of ongoing controversy on the grounds that it is regarded by some as the ‘forgotten thalidomide’. For these reasons it has been the subject of repeated calls for official government inquiries. A report was finally completed on Hormone Pregnancy Tests in 2017 by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s \(MHRA’s\) Expert Working Group \(EWG\), partly on the basis of evidence submitted by Olszynko\-Gryn \[E1\] \[E2\]. However the EWG’s report was widely criticised for a range of inadequacies, including those highlighted by Olszynko\-Gryn and Lewens. 

 Olszynko\-Gryn organised an international conference in Cambridge \(where Lewens spoke on Primodos and the precautionary principle\) that brought together academic experts, practising lawyers, and patient groups, many of whom were critical of the EWG’s approach \[E3\]. Lewens and Olszynko\-Gryn also collaborated with the Sky News documentary film\-maker Jason Farrell in the production of a film highlighting various shortcomings in the initial EWG report. The film was then screened in parliament—including a Q & A session for parliamentarians where Olszynko\-Gryn was a participant—prior to the parliamentary debates discussing the need for further review. Olszynko\-Gryn and Lewens contributed to meetings of the APPG on Hormone Pregnancy Tests, and they liaised closely with the campaigning group ACDHPT \(Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests\), to highlight a series of issues around the historical presentation of Primodos’s use, and the framework for risk governance and risk communication. In these ways, their interventions were instrumental in building parliamentary support in favour of further inquiry into Primodos. 

 Partly thanks to these interventions, a new official review was launched in February 2018. This was the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review \(IMMDSR\), led by Baroness Cumberlege, which reported on 8<sup>th</sup> July 2020. Yasmin Qureshi MP, Chair of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Hormone Pregnancy Tests, confirms the role of Lewens and Olszynko\-Gryn in the APPG, and in securing the new IMMDSR: 

 ‘The advice they gave … was instrumental in informing our MPs’ successful calls in parliament for the launch of a new inquiry. \[It\] is not an exaggeration to say that Jesse and Tim’s research played a key role in the launch of the…Cumberlege Inquiry…’ \[E4\] 

 Both Olszynko\-Gryn and Lewens went on to play roles in the new review. Olszynko\-Gryn gave evidence at an oral hearing of the IMMDSR on 26<sup>th</sup> November 2018, and Lewens submitted written evidence to the inquiry \[E5, E6\]. He argued that, ‘even when causal links \[between Primodos and birth defects\] are not established in a clear way—indeed, even when they are highly questionable—it can still be reasonable to take regulatory action in a precautionary manner. This is especially true when the value of a technology is in question, and when safe alternatives are available’ \[E6\]. Lewens’s basic argument was endorsed in the key finding of the Cumberlege report regarding Primodos: ‘Given the concerns raised, the non\-essential nature of HPTs and the provision of risk\-free alternative tests, we consider that the CSD \[Committee on Safety of Drugs\] focus should not have been whether or not to issue a warning. **They should have recommended the withdrawal of the indication for use as a pregnancy test in 1967’** \(\[E7\]; emphasis in original\) **.** 

 Olszynko\-Gryn and Lewens have also benefited the activities of the ACDHPT. Marie Lyon, the group’s Chair, has written that ‘The impact of the evidence provided by both Tim and Jesse undoubtedly played a huge part in the incredible and unexpected conclusions of the IMMDS report. This is the first time in more than 40 years that the failures of the Government Regulators in the 1960's &70s, have been identified and acknowledged in an Independent Government Review…ACDHPT owe a huge debt of gratitude for their continuing support.’ \[E8\] 

1.  **Astra Zeneca** 

 **Overview: Lewens’s work on medical risk led to an invitation to join AstraZeneca’s new AWERB \(Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body\). He has given training courses for AZ researchers, and has influenced the overall culture of care throughout the company. Key beneficiaries here include members of the AZ research community.** 

 In 2017 Lewens was invited to join AZ’s new Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board \(AWERB\) based on his track record of work on medical ethics and medical risk. Lewens has had a significant impact on the constitution and operation of the AWERB. In particular, Lewens’s longstanding research on the interpenetration of science and values has informed the committee’s own approach to the tight links it draws between ethical approval and scientific validity. He has also given two bespoke training courses on medical ethics and medical risk for AWERB members. The acting Chair of the AZ AWERB comments thus: 

 ‘His impact on the AWERB group, has been considerable and has reached through into the AZ organisation in Cambridge. … His regular contributions to committee meetings have also resulted in an enlarged remit for the AWERB group. In particular, … he has helped us to articulate the importance of attending to the wellbeing of those who conduct research, in addition to the more usual focus on the animals. This has had concrete impact in terms of our renewed attention across the company to the ‘culture of care’ in place for our research staff.’ \[E9\] 

1.  **Inherited Genetic Disorders** 

 **Overview: Lewens’s research on regulatory governance for risk has led to a role in the work of the International Commission on the Clinical Use of Human Germline Genome Editing; his earlier work with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics gave rise to decisive contributions to parliamentary debates on the legalisation of mitochondrial ‘donation’ technologies.** 

 In February 2020, Lewens accepted an invitation from the International Commission on the Clinical Use of Human Germline Genome Editing to comment in detail on an early draft of their report on *Heritable Human Germline Engineering* \[E10\]. This joint report of the US National Academies and the UK Royal Society aims to provide a global translational framework for the potential use of germline genetic interventions. The report is expected to have considerable international regulatory influence, in part because its publication will be timed to feed into the WHO Expert Advisory Committee on Developing Global Standards for Governance and Oversight of Human Genome Editing. 

 Lewens’s reputation in these matters derived from his earlier work with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. The Nuffield Council Report on Mitochondrial DNA Disorders, co\-authored by Lewens in 2012, expressed approval of two new experimental IVF techniques. Lewens was a member of the working party that authored this report, and he played a leading role in drafting the ethical framework within it. This involvement was confirmed by Council Director Hugh Whittall: 

 ‘…\[T\]he role that Tim Lewens played in the preparation and drafting of this important report was particularly notable.  His work in developing the ethical considerations, and especially in addressing issues around identity in relation to genetic therapies, formed a very substantial part of the arguments that sit at the heart of the report.  His further contribution in applying these ethical discussions to the novel case of potential treatments for mitochondrial disorders was also critical to the success of this report.’ \[E11\] 

 Lewens’s work in authoring the Nuffield Council report pre\-dates the REF review period; however, the impact of that work continued into the current period via the report’s influence on parliamentary debate and subsequent new legislation \(Human Fertilisation and Embryology \(Mitochondrial Donation\) Regulations 2015\). Following Parliamentary debates in both chambers, where parliamentarians repeatedly drew attention to the Council’s positive ethical verdict with respect to mitochondrial donation \[E12\], both of the technologies endorsed by the report were approved in legislation passed in February 2015.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by the University of Oxford’s regional units in Southeast Asia developed and validated strategies to eliminate malaria in the Greater Mekong Sub\-region, to prevent global spread of artemisinin\-resistance. Implementation of malaria control programmes based on this research, including mass drug administration and providing health care in remote villages, has achieved near elimination of *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria in the Thailand\-Myanmar border area, and dramatic reductions in *P. falciparum* and *P. vivax* in several Myanmar border regions. These interventions have transformed the health of poor and remote communities with a combined population of at least 1,000,000 people. The University of Oxford research directly influenced World Health Organisation \(WHO\) strategies on malaria elimination in Southeast Asia, including the goal of malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Sub\-region by 2030 and the use of mass drug administration, combating the spread of multi\-drug resistant malaria. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

####  Identifying approaches for malarial elimination in the Greater Mekong Sub\-region 

 The Greater Mekong Sub\-region \(GMS\) is a trans\-national region encompassing areas of 6 countries that share the Mekong River: Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Lao People's Democratic Republic \(Lao PDR\), and parts of China. The GMS is particularly crucial in the global fight against malaria, as it is in this region that parasites with resistance to malarial drugs have emerged and spread around the world. International efforts are now focused on trying to prevent the global spread of resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs, which emerged in the GMS. The University of Oxford Nuffield Department of Medicine Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health has several regional units working in the GMS engaged in research tackling malaria, including the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit \(MORU\), Shoklo Malaria Research Unit \(SMRU\) and Myanmar Oxford Clinical Research Unit \(MOCRU\). Ongoing research by these units, since 2000, has developed, tested, and implemented tools for malaria elimination. 

 University of Oxford researchers, including N. White, N. Day and A. Dondorp, have led the international Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration, which carried out extensive mapping of artemisinin resistance across 10 countries between May 2011 and April 2013 \[1\]. They found that artemisinin\-resistant *P. falciparum* was established in eastern Myanmar, western Cambodia and Thailand, and southern Vietnam, and was emerging in southern Laos and northeastern Cambodia, demonstrating an urgent need for radical measures in the GMS to prevent further spread \[1\]. To look in more detail at the prevalence and spread of malarial parasites in the GMS, the University of Oxford researchers developed an ultra\-sensitive quantitative PCR method that was able to detect low levels of malarial parasites \(limit of accurate detection, 22 parasites/mL\), even in asymptomatic people in low endemic areas. Using this approach across the GMS, they discovered an unsuspected high prevalence of asymptomatic sub\-microscopic parasitaemia, enabling them to work out the prevalence of parasitaemia and find “hot spots” of transmission \[2\]. Several University of Oxford studies showed that asymptomatic infections are an important source of malaria transmission in the GMS, and the need for interventions beyond treating symptomatic cases. For example, their modelling showed that to eliminate drug\-resistant malaria in the GMS, it would be necessary to eliminate all malaria in the region \[3\], including mass drug administration \(MDA\) to eliminate foci of higher transmission **.** 

####  Assessing risks of anti\-malarial drugs 

 The University of Oxford researchers conducted large meta\-analyses to assess the risks of several anti\-malarial drug treatments, investigating whether they could be used on a large scale \(e.g. in MDA\) without substantial risks. Dihydroartemisinin\-piperaquine is an effective artemisinin\-based combination therapy, but there had been some evidence that piperaquine might be associated with cardiac arrhythmias. In a key example of assessing drug risk, the University of Oxford researchers performed a large systematic review and meta\-analysis and found there was no increase in risk of cardiac sudden death following treatment with piperaquine \[4\]. This research showed that piperaquine could be used on a large scale without cardiotoxicity. The researchers also showed the safety of widespread primaquine use. 

####  Field trials of mass drug administration 

 Based on these findings and their wider research in the GMS, the University of Oxford researchers undertook field trials to evaluate the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of targeted malaria elimination. Mass drug administration was tested initially on a small scale in four malaria\-endemic villages in Karen \(Kayin\) State in Myanmar \[5\], and then in 16 remote villages \(8 MDA\-treated, 8 controls\) with prevalent artemisinin resistance: in the ‘epicentre’ of resistance in western Cambodia, as well as Lao PDR, Vietnam and Myanmar \[6\]. The field trials achieved high coverage, were safe, and associated with at least short\-term dramatic declines in *P. falciparum,* for example 92% decrease in *P. falciparum* prevalence in the villages treated with MDA, compared to a 29% decrease in control villages \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Influencing World Health Organisation strategies for malaria elimination 

 The University of Oxford\-led research has influenced international strategy that is being implemented in the GMS. Specifically, in 2014, the WHO Drug Resistance and Containment Technical Expert Group for malaria \(chaired by A. Dondorp, F Smithuis on committee\) provided evidence to the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee of the WHO \(MPAC; N. White on committee\). This evidence included University of Oxford\-led research on the prevalence of artemisinin resistance in the GMS \[1\], pilot MDA in the GMS \[5, 6\], and community health worker programmes in Myanmar \(see below, led by F. Smithuis\) \[A\]. On the basis of evaluation of this evidence, MPAC recommended the elimination of *P. falciparum* in the GMS by 2030 \[B\], to counter the threat of multidrug resistance – as advocated by the University of Oxford research \(e.g. \[3\]\) – and this goal was adopted as WHO strategy in 2015 \[C\]. 

 Also, several tools for malaria elimination that were developed and assessed through University of Oxford research have been endorsed by the WHO. MDA has been controversial, and University of Oxford researchers and their findings \(e.g. \[3, 5, 6\]\) have had a major influence on the debate \[D\].  Since 2015, the WHO has endorsed MDA as a strategy for malaria elimination in low transmission areas \[E\], influenced by evidence from University of Oxford research projects \(e.g. \[5, 6\]\) \[A, B\]. Specifically for the GMS, the 2015 WHO recommendations state “ *given the threat of multidrug resistance and the WHO call for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong subregion \(GMS\), MDA may be considered as a component of accelerated malaria elimination efforts in areas of the GMS with good access to treatment, vector control and surveillance*” \[E\]. Also, the assessments of drug risk from University of Oxford research \(e.g. \[4\]\), contributed to the recommendations of drug choices for MDA, with the MPAC noting in 2017 that “ *the cardiovascular risk associated with the antimalarial drugs piperaquine, amodiaquine, chloroquine is considered very low and these medicines can be used in mass drug administration for malaria”* \[F\], and the WHO 2017 Malaria MDA Field Manual recommending dihydroartemisinin\-piperaquine as part of MDA \[G\]. 

####  Achieving elimination of malaria in remote regions of Myanmar 

 Myanmar has the greatest malarial burden in the GMS, with 79% of all malaria cases in the GMS in 2012. Reducing malaria transmission in high\-transmission areas in Myanmar is one of the priorities of the WHO GMS strategy \[C\]. Much of the burden of malaria in Myanmar is in poor and extremely remote communities, particularly in the border regions; the villages may be accessible only on foot or by off\-road vehicles, and inaccessible during monsoon rains. Before 2013, healthcare systems in these communities had been weakened by long\-term under\-investment and conflict, leaving poor infrastructure and most villagers with no access to healthcare professionals. The University of Oxford research units in the region applied the knowledge and tools they had developed \(including \[1\-6\]\) to implement targeted malaria elimination strategies that have caused dramatic declines in cases of malaria, transforming the health of local communities with a combined population of more than 1,000,000 people and contributing substantially to the WHO goal of malaria elimination by 2030. 

#####  MDA and early treatment in Karen \(Kayin\) State 

 Between May 2014 and April 2017, the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit \(SMRU\) established 1,222 malarial ‘posts’ providing free access to early malaria diagnosis and treatment to remote communities in Karen State, along the Myanmar\-Thai border \[H\]. In this time, they diagnosed and treated approximately 365,000 people \[H\]. Using the ultrasensitive PCR methods \(e.g. \[2\]\), they identified villages that were malarial hotspots, and 50 hotspot villages were treated with MDA drug regimes \- dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus single\-dose primaquine once per month for 3 consecutive months \- guided by University of Oxford research on using MDA as an elimination strategy and the choice of drugs \(e.g. \[3\]\). In the MDA\-treated villages, there was a 5\-fold decease in *P. falciparum* incidence. By April 2017, these interventions had resulted in 965 \(79%\) of 1,222 villages with malarial posts being free from *P falciparum* malaria for at least 6 months \[H\]. According to SMRU, in 2020, there were 1,222 malarial posts in operation and 1,060 of these \(87%\) had reported zero cases of *P. falciparum* malaria during 2020, showing sustained near\-elimination of *P. falciparum* malaria. In the HpaPun district \(the most remote and malarious area of Karen State\) the yearly incidence of *P. falciparum* malaria has decreased by 96% since 2014, when the programme began, and by 83% since 2016, when the majority of the malarial post network was established. Importantly, the prevalence of artemisinin resistance molecular markers was stable over 3 years \(2014\-2017\), indicating success in preventing spread of drug resistance \[H\]. 

 This elimination of malaria has transformed health on both sides of the Myanmar\-Thai border. Importantly, removing the burden of malaria from the health care systems in these remote areas enables their limited resources to be redirected to treating other diseases. The director of a hospital in Tak Province in Thailand, close to the border with Myanmar, credited the interventions by SMRU and MORU for a dramatic change numbers of patients with malaria, and stated: “ *Malaria \(P. falciparium\) was one of the major causes of illness and hospital admission along the Thai\-Myanmar border region until the last five years. Most of the malaria came from the Myanmar side of the border…Now it has almost gone*” \[I\]. The director of the Department of Medical Science in the Ministry of Public Health for Thailand confirmed that, due to the SMRU work in Karen State, “ *by 2020, P. falciparum malaria had been almost completely eliminated, thus preventing the spread of artemisinin resistance…The impact on the health of the population has been remarkable”*, with cases in Tak Province \(population approximately 600,000\) being very rare in 2020 compared to being “ *a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the past*” \[J\]. Refugees and migrant workers in the border region have particularly poor access to healthcare \[D\], and the director of a charity providing health services to these people confirmed that SMRU and MORU’s malaria eradication campaigns have made *“significant changes”* in the region \[K\]. 

#####  Community health workers in border regions 

 Since 2013, the Myanmar Oxford Clinical Research Unit \(MOCRU\) has worked together with the medical aid charity Medical Action Myanmar \(MAM\) to achieve malaria elimination through community health worker \(CHW\) programmes. These CHWs in remote border areas of Myanmar, adjoining Thailand, India, Bangladesh and China, use rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and provide high\-quality treatment. The rationale for implementing these CHW programmes in these remote regions was based on University of Oxford research demonstrating the need for malaria elimination in these key areas with emerging drug resistance \(including \[1, 2, 3, 6\]\). 

 MAM initially started the programme in 2011 with 103 CHWs in Mon State, but working with MOCRU from 2013 the programme expanded to 1,326 CHWs across eight regions and covering approximately 728,057 people \(1.3% of population of Myanmar\) \[L\]. They diagnosed and treated more than 21,000 cases of malaria. For each year that the CHW programme operated, there was a 70% \(95% CI 66–73%\) decrease in *P. falciparum* incidence and a 64% \(95% CI 59–68%\) decrease in *P. vivax* incidence. Overall, this project led to a dramatic decrease in malaria: 97% decrease in falciparum malaria and 95% decrease of vivax malaria within 3 years \(up to 2016\) \[L\]. 

 Crucially, from 2013, the CHWs began to provide a basic health care package in addition to malaria diagnosis and treatment. This included treatment for malnutrition, diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections, and it brought two strands of benefits. Firstly, local people with other health conditions received diagnosis and treatment, including, in 2016, diagnosis of 14,509 cases of pneumonia and identification and referral to hospital of 6,278 patients with suspected tuberculosis \[L\]. Secondly, this provision of services beyond malaria by the CHWs ensured that people continued to seek their help even after there were large reductions in malaria, ensuring the few remaining cases of malaria continued to be detected and treated early, which is essential for elimination \[L\]. In all 167 communities in Mon state where MAM had introduced CHWs, falciparum malaria was eliminated, with only a single \- imported \- positive case detected from 55,000 rapid diagnostic tests during 2017\-2018.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Essex research provided the crucial insights to create a novel media monitoring platform to monitor global news for business intelligence. The platform produced through research with global executive search and selection firm MBS Group, enables scalable automation of tailored news provision as well as delivering the high quality business intelligence companies demand, more widely. The platform proved so marketable that it enabled a new company, Signal AI to establish its commercial viability with rapid growth supported by Essex research in a collaboration, winning two national KTP awards. \[text removed for publication\]. Signal AI has since grown from 3 to over 150 full\-time employees, \[text removed for publication\].

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research led by Kruschwitz in the University of Essex's Natural Language and Information Processing \(NLIP\) research group demonstrated the capability for industry strength application of state of the art insights/research in Natural Language Processing \(NLP\) and Information Retrieval \(IR\). Specifically, research presented in \[G1\] led to the development of an enterprise\-level intranet search engine for real world scalable applications \[R1\] and provided insights into improving suggestions to guide users \[R2\]. This demonstrated the capability required for \[G1\] through which a new media monitoring platform \[R3\] was developed. Subsequent research \[R5, G3\] advanced it further. 

 Work on supporting field operatives for British Telecom with contextual search \[R1\] progressed enterprise search level towards performance quality comparable to mainstream Internet search engines, i.e. those able to process large quantities of information in structured mark\-up \(typically HTML, but also PDF and Microsoft Word formats\). The work in \[R1\] also provided insights into processing and indexing and then retrieving document collections residing in different data silos, which importantly, is analogous to processing a heterogeneous stream of news articles. In practice, the search engine in \[R1\] was developed and deployed for technical support staff. This ran live for several years and was accessed by the field force of the large telecommunications company. Kruschwitz et al.’s interactive adaptive query suggestion mechanism proposed \[R1\] guided users' searches through suggestions \(for words and phrases users enter into a search box to obtain a list of results\) derived from previous interactions. Further insights into generating such suggestions to enhance search, not of the whole web but smaller and more focused collections \[R2\] demonstrated: \(1\) the usefulness of log analysis to extract query modification suggestions; \(2\) a more fine\-grained approach than grouping search requests into sessions allows for extraction of better refinement terms from query log files \[R2\]. 

 Search method insights \[R1, R2\] resulted in \[G2\] by evidencing industry applicability. Research by Kruschwitz, Poesio and Martinez\-Alvarez to build a scalable architecture for automated information provision resulted in a novel information search and filtering platform \[R3\]. This aggregates, analyses and classifies news articles so that they can be matched against a client's bespoke search profile. The cloud based architecture formed by an analytics pipeline comprising: *Document Stream > Summarisation > Named Entity Recognition* \( *NER\)/* *entity recognition and disambiguation \(ERD\) > Topic Classification > De\-duplication > Clustering > Email Delivery to Client*. Each one of the 5 text analytics modules between document stream and Email delivery has a different component. Each document is processed through all the components, extending the information available for it. For instance, after the summarisation component, the system has access to the summary of the document. Near\-duplication detection addresses the problem caused by republished articles in written media. Moreover, if not considered duplicates, often there are tens or hundreds of articles focused on the same information. These are addressed using clustering and event detection mechanisms. The pipeline uses a queuing system between components, allowing them to scale independently. This characteristic provides a scalable solution while minimising the complexity of the architecture. This also allows focus on specific solutions for each one of the components in order to improve the quality of the system over time \[R3\]. This addressed information filtering systems' growing problem of information overload, in particular to obtain insights to inform strategic decision making from disparate sources. The media monitoring platform \[R3\] allowed information search, filtering and summarisation on a scale and at a speed that was previously not possible as a single business service to analyse all the news of the world in real\-time. 

 Essex NLIP researchers addressed the media monitoring platform’s next stage in development in \[G3\]. The new approach for scalable visualisation of sentiment and stance, which addressed scalable visualisation of planning data in e\-government, \[R5\] was presented to Signal AI, demonstrating capability to address the problem in \[G3\]. Moreover, the first published paper into the problem of identifying whether a news article can be identified as topical or an aggregation of different news stories \[R5\], showed that the process can be broken down into a two\-stage approach: first segment an article into smaller units, examine possible topic shifts and then apply a neural\-network\-based approach akin to image processing to identify whether the article/image resembles an aggregate or a topical piece. This advanced topic detection and filtering summary articles – key to the media monitoring system’s analytics modules. Narrow searches may exclude important information. Broader scope was exceeding existing monitoring products. Some articles, e.g., summaries should be excluded \[R2\]. Further work by Chamberlain and Brill on \[G3\] addressed turning a large feed of news articles into a digest of a small number of articles summarising and covering the key insights in those articles. They developed IR algorithms \(based on clustering and ranking\) for this \(as noted in \[S5\]\). \[text removed for publication\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Development of a novel media monitoring platform contributed to business success for MBS and the rapid expansion of Signal AI** 

 Company executives require regular, up\-to\-date news tailored to their business or sector to inform decision making. MBS Group \(MBS\), a leading global executive search and selection firm, found its manually produced newsletter was not providing the width and depth of coverage or the high quality, relevant, personalised external information required by its senior executives. \[text removed for publication\] Essex’s NLIP researchers demonstrated their research was applicable to this \[R1, R2, G1\]. Consequently, \[text removed for publication\] they began a project \[G2\] in 2013 to build the architecture required. Their resulting media monitoring platform is a state\-of\-the\-art, cloud\-based information processing architecture solution \[R3\] that not only enables scalable automation of providing tailored news but proved capable of delivering the high quality business intelligence companies demand more widely. The platform analyses world news, filtering out noise and focusing on trends and strategic information, users are provided with a structured stream of documents relevant to their business needs. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Importantly, through ongoing collaboration with Essex's NLIP researchers, the underlying technology for a new company, Signal AI, was established \[text removed for publication\]. According to Signal AI, the collaboration with the University of Essex ‘ *created tangible value for Signal AI by allowing us to bridge the academic and industrial ecosystems in a seamless way through application of the University of Essex’s research. The first project allowed us to set the foundations of our Natural Language Processing \(NLP\) pipeline, Signal AI’s platform, by working in collaboration with Prof Udo Kruschwitz and Prof Massimo Poesio to apply their NLP expertise*' \[S2\]. **The project transformed the business so significantly and led to winning in 2015 the best Knowledge Transfer Partnership award of the year** \[S3\]. Essex research was further embedded in Signal AI through Albakour becoming Data Scientist \(in 2015\) and Kruschwitz continuing as Signal AI’s Senior Advisor to ‘ *advise and guide Signal AI in all research matters*’ \[S4\]. 

 Essex’s research was an essential part of Signal’s rapid expansion. Signal AI generated its first substantial sales to several well\-known brands and organisations \[text removed for publication\]. This project *‘helped the company secure investment of over £5.8m. This played a pivotal and transformative role in the development of Signal’s AI\-powered media monitoring capabilities as well as the company’s growth’* \[S4\]. In the second Innovate UK project with the company \(started January 2019\), Signal AI worked with Kruschwitz \(until June 2019\) and, leading thereafter, Chamberlain *‘who provided his expertise and advice, based on his research at Essex, not only on NLP but also on Human Computer Interaction \(HCI\) in order to maximise the value of the new developments in our product. This project started a new product line in the company*' \[S2\]. Signal AI adds ‘ *the collaboration provided us the support to move one level higher in the value chain, looking at how to provide more strategic insights to our clients based on our data*’. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Commenting on the company’s growth, Signal AI note *‘During the course of these collaborations, Signal AI has gone from three people working in a garage to over 150 full\-time employees now based in offices in London, New York and Hong Kong’* \[S2\]. They add that Signal AI’s collaborations with the University of Essex, as well as the features delivered as a result, have been a key selling point in discussions with investors *‘Signal AI has obtained more than £50,000,000 of investment to date, with the most recent Series C funding round of almost £20,000,000 completed in 2019*’ \[S2\].  \[text removed for publication\] Signal AI developed a new feature, Signal Briefings, which provides clients with an executive level summary of a large feed of news to save time and keep clients updated with industry news \[S5, S6\]. \[text removed for publication\]. In reporting the next generation of AI technology in the Signal AI platform in February 2020, \[S6\] highlights ‘ *Signal AI, one of the leading companies transforming how business leaders make sense of the world’s information*' in 2019 *'saw unprecedented success, more than doubling its customer base, international expansion into the US and Asia Pacific, and a successful Series C funding’*. Signal conclude that ‘ *Working with Essex's natural language processing and text analytics researchers gave our start\-up the technical expertise needed to differentiate ourselves in a competitive market*' CEO, Signal \[S2\]. This collaboration ‘ *helped us drive innovation in the company*’ \[S2\]. 

 **Signal AI’s** \[text removed for publication\] **global clients benefit from the Signal media\-monitoring platform** 

 \[text removed for publication\] The Signal AI platform has gone on to change the practice of its business clients in areas such as, tracking press coverage, monitoring global news, monitoring policy change and content generation and business intelligence \[S7\]. Public relations teams use Signal AI’s platform to track news coverage of their clients, for both promotional campaigns and to monitor negative news stories for reputation management and competitor performance. The platform has enabled MBS themselves, as well as leading international law firms such as Bird and Bird and Simmons and Simmons, to save time enabling them to process more information and adding value to their business. Bird & Bird’s PR team saved over an hour a day using the platform and note “ *We have halved our annual expenditure on media monitoring, but expanded and improved the speed of our coverage tracking.*” Head of Marketing and Communications, Bird & Bird \[S7\]. Simmons and Simmons, save 4\-5 hours a month tracking news coverage, improving efficiency and enabling more information to be processed. The platform is also used to monitor enterprise\-level legal policy and law. Deloitte, the largest professional services firm in the world, report that the platform enables over 1,200 of its clients  to stay informed about changes proposed and enacted in law and regulation transforming the way they monitor and assess changes to tax law and regulation \[S7\]. 

 Beyond business, the platform is used by NGOs such as Scholars At Risk, Amnesty International and the Disasters Emergency Committee to monitor and verify reports of human rights violations, and to deliver efficient responses to global disasters \[S7\]. Scholars At Risk, an organisation, which aims to protect threatened academic scholars around the world, report a 50% reduction in time spent monitoring global news for human rights violations, potential attacks on higher education institutes and to strategically plan campaigns and advocacy. The product has measurably helped their cause ‘ *time saved is people saved*’ Senior Program Officer, Scholars At Risk \[S7\]. Amnesty International is using the platform to verify eyewitness reports of human rights violations happening globally. Within the first few weeks of using this, they were able to quickly corroborate an eyewitness video of an extrajudicial execution in Mexico by locating a local Spanish language news story. Amnesty International was then able to compile sufficient evidence to call upon the authorities to perform an independent investigation. ‘ *We were able to discover relevant news from sources we didn’t know existed*’ Head of Digital Verification Corps at Amnesty International \[S7\]. The Signal product, enables the Disasters Emergency Committee, which coordinates the delivery of efficient disaster responses in the world’s poorest countries ‘ *to have unlimited clippings during busy times without extra cost \[…\] the flexibility of controlling our media monitoring service from our desktops allows valued agility to keep up with unpredictable and fast moving crises’* CEO, Disaster Emergency Committee \[S7\]. 

 In conclusion, the CEO of Signal AI notes **' **Our partnership with the University of Essex has been long and fruitful, and it has helped shape Signal into the innovative media company it is today**.’ CEO, Signal AI** \[S2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Although microfinance is recognised as a tool to promote self\-employment and inclusion among disadvantaged groups in Europe, its impact is limited by a lack of scale and low financial self\-sufficiency for microfinance institutions \(MFIs\). To address this, the European Commission contracted Dayson and Vik to develop a microfinance code of conduct based on their research into appropriate standards and self\-regulatory frameworks for microfinance in the developed world. The Code has been adopted by 53 MFIs across 19 countries, and the European Union now requires compliance with it in order for non\-bank MFIs to access microfinance funding. In addition to influencing national legislation and trade body recommendations, adoption of the Code has resulted in larger and better funded MFIs with stronger reputations, greater accountability and improved oversight. Services are now provided in a more consistent and transparent manner to customers whose rights are unevenly covered by existing regulation within different European countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2004, Dayson and Vik have, at the research centre Community Finance Solutions \(CFS\), conducted research into viable and effective models for microfinance institutions \(MFIs\) in Europe. Dayson compared the financial performance and staff time use \(from timesheets\) for four UK MFIs \(2004\) **\[3.1\]** and Dayson, Vik and colleagues conducted a comparative analysis of the efficiency and sustainability of five UK MFIs \(2007 – 2008\) **\[3.2\]**. Among the first and most detailed studies of the business and operating models of MFIs in Europe, these studies provided key insights into the nature and determinants of financial sustainability of microfinance in developed economies: 

-  The operating environment for MFIs in European nations differs from those in the developing world. In Europe, the potential market is smaller, due to lower self\-employment rates and highly developed financial sectors. Income generation is restricted because consumers are more price\-sensitive and interest rates are often subject to caps **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. 

-  There is significant variation in the financial performance across MFIs in the same context due to differences in pricing, scale, efficiency and productivity **\[3.2, 3.4\]**. Hence standardisation and sharing good practice can improve performance **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. 

 As further evidence of their contribution to the field, Dayson coedited the first research handbook on European microfinance \(2010\) and was among the founding members of the European microfinance research network \(2005\). Together with Vik, he was awarded the 2008 European microcredit research award for their benchmarking study **\[3.2\]**. 

 Following this work, the European Commission awarded Dayson and Vik a contract in 2010 to draft the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision. As a result, Dayson and Vik started conducting research into self\-regulatory frameworks focusing on two areas: 

-  **Operating standards for European MFIs:** The first part focused on developing standards appropriate for the European context. The overwhelming majority of existing standards have been intended and designed for the developing world. Dayson and Vik conducted an extensive review of more than 70 existing standards on governance, customer protection, management information systems, risk management and reporting standards. They then tested the applicability of these international standards through a series of stakeholder workshops that discussed the standards in terms of fit with existing legal frameworks, cost and resource implications, and effectiveness. The authors subsequently piloted the proposed standards with 12 European MFIs \(2011 – 2012\). More recently, Dayson and Vik led the drafting of social performance standards \(2016 – 2017\), which were incorporated into the Code in 2020 as part of a consultation. This project involved adopting and adapting relevant practices from international social performance frameworks through a series of practitioner roundtables. This was the first ever systematic analysis of the appropriateness of international microfinance standards in the developed world. Once combined, this work revealed that international standards are often ill\-suited to the European sector because MFIs in this market focus on riskier, smaller and more marginal client groups, and are also smaller and less mature compared with their developing country counterparts **\[3.5, 3.6\]**. 

-  **Role and effectiveness of self\-regulation:** More broadly the research focused on how the Commission could develop an effective self\-regulatory framework for the Code. Dayson and Vik analysed the existing international frameworks in terms of validation of compliance, allowance for differentiation by type of institution, mechanisms for dealing with non\-compliance and whether they generated a quantifiable rating for MFIs. Hitherto, this was the most extensive review of international standards in microfinance. The research concluded that the effectiveness of self\-regulation is hampered by the lack of consequences for and enforcement of non\-compliance, by an inclination to promote minimum rather than aspirational standards, and a lack of transparency to encourage peer learning and improvements through market discipline **\[3.5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Microfinance is a growing policy area in Europe due to its ability to promote social inclusion and employment among disadvantaged groups denied access to mainstream finance or employment, such as women, migrants and low\-income individuals. Microcredit refers to loans of up to EUR25,000 available to new or existing microenterprises. By 2017, the European microfinance sector had disbursed  [635,000 microcredits with a value of EUR2.1 billion](https://www.european-microfinance.org/publication/microfinance-europe-survey-report-2016-2017) per annum. Yet, for the most part, MFIs are still small, dependent on subsidies and lack capacity to grow and become sustainable. To address this, the European Commission identified the need for a code of practice in 2007 to disseminate and promote good practice in the sector. Given the regulatory and institutional diversity in the European microfinance sector, the Commission identified a voluntary code as the best way to set pan\-European practices and rights for the benefit of all customers and stakeholders. 

 **4.1. Establishment of a European framework for good practice** 

 Dayson and Vik drafted the European Code of Good Conduct for Microcredit Provision in 2010 –2011 through a contract with the European Commission. They were invited to tender for the drafting of the Code based on their experience and expertise in microfinance in developed countries and were subsequently awarded a second contract to develop the methodology to assess compliance with the Code \(2012 – 2013\) **\[see 5.1\]**. The Code now contains over 150 clauses detailing recommended practices in customer relations, governance, risk management, management information systems \(MIS\) and reporting. The MFIs signing up to the Code are subject to an external evaluation by the microfinance rating agency MF Rating. In 2014, the EU made compliance with the Code a precondition for accessing European microfinance funding for nonbank MFIs **\[5.1\]**. Banks were not included, already being subject to significant regulation. 

 The European Commission summarised Dayson and Vik’s extensive contributions as follows: 

 *‘The research conducted by Dayson and Vik as part of these contracts significantly influenced the content and process of the Code. Firstly, based on a review of best practices, they developed detailed standards in the themes identified by the European Commission in the terms of reference. Secondly, two chapters were added on the topics of customer and investor relations, and reporting standards and public disclosure on the recommendation of researchers. Thirdly, they influenced the evaluation and award process for the Code, especially the creation, role and membership of the steering group, the evaluation methodology and process, and the importance of external validation and having mechanisms dealing with noncompliance’* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2. Uptake of the Code and impact on microfinance sector regulation** 

 To date, the Code has led to widespread changes and improvements in the microfinance sector. Out of  [138 nonbank MFIs](https://www.european-microfinance.org/publication/microfinance-europe-survey-report-2016-2017), 53 MFIs \(38%\) from 19 European countries, including France, the UK, the Netherlands, Romania and Poland, were awarded the Code between 2016 and 2020. This included all the MFI board members of the EU microfinance trade body, the European Microfinance Network **\[5.2\]**. MFIs, bank partners, regulators and governments see the Code as a best practice framework against which to benchmark MFI performance and practices. There are examples of newly established European MFIs using the Code *‘as a blueprint for developing systems and processes to a high standard’* **\[5.3\]**. 

 In Greece and Romania, the Code has been used as a template to inform national regulation and practice **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. On 24 June 2020, the Greek Parliament adopted a new law on microfinance that requires MFIs to be compliant with the Code to be funded under national investment programmes. Organisations that are awarded the Code are allowed to provide microcredit under this law **\[5.5\]**. In the Romanian microfinance sector, the Code has significantly improved practice and performance through adoption by a leading MFI trade body **\[5.4\]**. Romania is among the largest microfinance markets in Europe and has the largest concentration of Code awardees **\[5.2\]**. According to the Romanian trade body representing 15 MFIs awarded or in the pipeline for the Code, *‘there have been many concrete changes resulting from implementing the Code’* **\[5.4\]**, including greater consistency and transparency in the information provided to customers as well as greater use of customer satisfaction surveys. The positive effects of these changes are *‘evidenced by increased customer satisfaction levels and increased membership numbers’* **\[5.4\]**. The MFIs have put in place more robust processes for dealing with conflicts of interest, management succession planning and board induction and training. *‘Taken together these changes have strengthened governance arrangements across the sector’* **\[5.4\]**. The changes in practice resulting from the Code *‘have led to higher performing organisations, better served customers and stronger governance. Overall the Code has led to greater impact through the increase in the number of customers supported’* **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.3. Improvements to business practices benefitting MFIs and their customers** 

 Across Europe, ‘ *the Code has motivated the MFIs to revise their practices as a whole, through the lens of the customer, and implement processes that increase their level of accountability’* **\[5.6\]**. A survey of 42 MFIs from 19 countries shows that 40%\-70% have made changes in practice in customer treatment, governance, risk management, reporting standards and MIS to comply with the Code. According to one respondent: *‘The Code forced us to have a 360 degree review of our practices \(clients protection/communication, governance, risk monitoring.’* Another *‘used it as guidelines for development of our institution’* **\[5.7\]**. MF Rating identified 14 MFIs that have made 28 changes in practice explicitly to comply with the Code, including pricing transparency, customer rights, business planning, risk management and customer complaint procedures **\[5.6\]**. 13 of the 14 MFIs taking part in an external evaluation of the impact of the Code reported improving their practice as a result of the Code **\[5.3\]**. MFIs made changes in the following areas: 

-  **Customer experience:** The Code has brought greater consistency and impacted *‘positively in terms of transparency’* **\[5.7\]** regarding the information provided to customers, even within the same countries **\[5.3, 5.5\].** Nearly 70% of MFIs surveyed had made changes to customer rights and complaints and information provided to customers, whilst 60% had altered customer complaints procedures **\[5.7\]**. Four MFIs, interviewed as part of the external evaluation, reported improving their communication with customers through the information provided to customers when applying for loans as well as introducing customer satisfaction surveys. Five organisations changed their complaint procedures to make it clearer and more accessible by putting it on their website and two improved the customer journey **\[5.3\]**. MFIs also started disclosing effective interest rates and allowing customers to withdraw within 14 days of the granting of the microcredit, thereby placing customers in a better position to make informed decisions **\[5.6\]**. 

-  **Business planning:** Nearly 60% of MFIs made changes to their approach to business planning and over 40% altered personnel and management policies **\[5.7\]**. Three MFIs moved to a 3\-year planning cycle as stipulated in the Code forcing them to take a more strategic approach to business planning **\[5.3\]**. MFIs also started including detailed budgeting and forecasting and incorporated risk assessment in their business plan **\[5.6\]**. 

-  **Improved governance:** According to an external evaluation, MFIs enhanced their governance, board performance, oversight and accountability by adding more formal board induction \(3 MFIs\), recruiting additional board members \(3\), removing board members \(2\) and providing more Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) for board members \(4\) **\[5.3\]**. 

-  **Risk management:** Several MFIs improved their risk management, including improving or adding internal audit mechanisms **\[5.3\]**. Organisations implemented internal audit functions, appointed senior managers to be accountable for risk management and put in place mechanisms to identify, assess and prioritise risks. MFIs started using PAR30, the internationally accepted portfolio quality measure in microfinance, to measure loan delinquency **\[5.6\]**. Around half of MFIs surveyed changed loan portfolio monitoring and processes for identifying risk, whilst 40% altered/introduced internal audit function. 

 **4.4. Reputational and financial benefits for MFIs** 

 MFIs experienced clear reputational benefits through adoption of the framework due to its requirement for improved governance and accountability. This resulted in increased levels of funding, a larger customer base and strengthened their stakeholder relationships. 

-  **Enhanced reputation:** Eight out of ten MFIs surveyed reported that the Code had greatly improved or improved the reputation and credibility of their organisations, whilst nearly 70% reported greatly improved or improved visibility of their organisations. For half, the Code had greatly improved or improved their ability to attract new partners. For one respondent *‘it offered recognition and appreciation from peer institutions’* **\[5.7\]**. An external evaluation found that the Code enhanced the reputation of 12 MFIs vis\-à\-vis external stakeholders. It facilitated establishing and operating partnerships with banks and strengthened the negotiating position by demonstrating the importance of microcredit provision **\[5.3\]**. 

-  **Ability to raise funding:** Out of the MFIs surveyed, 32% or 14 providers reported that the Code had improved their ability to access funding. Estimates of impact on funding ranged from EUR250,000 to EUR35,000,000, with one respondent estimating *‘an impact of 20\-30% of total funding’* **\[5.7\]**. According to an external evaluation, nine MFIs reported improved access to funding, nine were able to access European funding and three were able to access wider funding as implementing the Code helped with due diligence with other investors. Specifically, the Code requirements meant that MFIs were in a better position to provide more complete information. According to three MFIs, the Code award enhanced their standing and ability to get increased funding from existing investors **\[5.3\]**. 

-  **Increased customer numbers and satisfaction:** MFIs reported that improved consistency, transparency and use of customer satisfaction surveys led to greater customer satisfaction and increased customer numbers **\[5.3\]**. It set apart four MFIs from their competitors by highlighting to their customers that they are responsible lenders **\[5.3\]**. Out of the MFIs surveyed, 60% found that the Code had enabled them to differentiate themselves in the market **\[5.7\]**. 

 Adoption of the Code has resulted in numerous positive impacts on MFI organisational culture, which will also be transmitted to their customers and stakeholders. According to an external evaluation of the Code: *‘It is notable that fourteen of the fifteen people interviewed felt that the code had had a positive impact on their organisation or the organisation\(s\) that they supported. This came across clearly and comprehensively during the interviews’* **\[5.3\]**. According to MFI survey respondents, the Code had *‘improved internal ethical culture’*, *‘increased transparency’,* had a *‘positive impact on staff alignment with the values of the company’* and led to ‘ *better trained employees.’* According to a third of MFIs surveyed, the Code had also strengthened their ability to cope with the effects of COVID\-19 **\[5.6\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at the University of Chichester has enhanced the delivery of annual A\-Level Study Days at Chichester Cathedral, shaped the development of a West Sussex Youth Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education \(SACRE\) conference and created opportunities for sharing research in the areas of theology, philosophy and religious studies in West Sussex and Hampshire schools. These engagements draw on Graeme Smith’s approach to enquiry\-based learning to develop popular public theological reflections, particularly related to questions of identity and justice. Combining his pedagogical research with Lynch’s and Strømmen’s work in philosophy, religious studies and Biblical studies has developed students’ awareness and sensitivity to complex theological, religious and ethical issues. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Graeme Smith’s research confronts 2 key issues in helping students engage with the complexity of theological questions. First, he claims that traditional modes of disseminating information about theological ideas fail to engage students, arguing instead for problem\-based and enquiry\-based pedagogies \[ **R1**\]. Second, he encourages students to reflect on their own popular public theologies, ideas that can be in tension with official teachings \[ **R2**\]. This approach emphasises the development of self\-reflexivity and critical thinking rather than the transfer of knowledge. In so doing, it contests understandings of religion as static or dogmatic, while encouraging active engagement with complex cultural identities. The result is a form of theological thinking that appeals to a wide range of students, not just those who comfortably locate themselves within a religious tradition, and helps students understand the ongoing significance of theology as an intellectual method. 

 This approach of fostering self\-reflexive exploration of popular public theologies through enquiry\-based and problem\-based learning has provided the foundation for Smith, Lynch and Strømmen’s dissemination of research on the complex relationship between religion, politics and identity. In 2015, the University made 2 major investments in this research. The first was a stipendiary PhD bursary to support research on pedagogical approaches to fostering critical thinking and the education of citizens. The second was a Research Development Award that provided GBP8,000 for a research project on religion and race. One of the products of that research \[ **R3**\] draws on ‘critical religion’. This interdisciplinary approach offers critical evaluations of the categories ‘religion’ and ‘secularism’ in order to provide further understanding of popular public understandings of religion in relationship to contemporary political and ethical issues, particularly Islamophobia and racism. For example, Lynch shows that religion has been used throughout history to determine racial classifications and race has been used to identify individuals as members of a particular religious community, regardless of their actual religious identity. 

 The interplay between religion and philosophy is also central to Lynch’s work on apocalyptic political theology. In a monograph on this subject \[ **R5**\], he outlines a concept of ‘world’ by tracing the relationship between ecological, political, cultural and economic crises. He argues that attempts to preserve this world risk perpetuating unsustainable and unjust relations between living things and their environments. He concludes that philosophers should focus on transforming rather than preserving those relations. 

 Engaging with the complexity of theological ideas and identities also requires attending to the nature and function of religious texts. In 2018, Strømmen published a monograph in the field of biblical reception history \[ **R4**\]. While acknowledging the contributions of historical critical approaches to the Bible, Strømmen emphasises the need to understand the ongoing lives of these texts and the way that they operate in various contexts. This research focuses on the role of the Bible in understanding the relationship between humans, animals and the rest of the natural world. The methodological innovations of the book have a wide scope, from the use of the Bible in detective novels to its invocation by far\-right political movements.

 The A\-Level curriculum for Religious Studies focuses on a number of classic topics in theology, philosophy and religion. While important, students often find these topics disconnected from their lived experience of religious identities or ethical dilemmas. On the basis of Smith’s work on education and popular public theology, Cynara Davies \(Head of Learning and Engagement, Chichester Cathedral\) invited him to participate in the reformatting of Chichester Cathedral’s A\-Level Study Day in 2015. Smith aimed to move away from workshops focused on these standard topics and introduce students to newer approaches within the subject area. Rev’d Canon Dr Daniel Inman \(Chancellor, Chichester Cathedral\) has confirmed that Smith was ‘instrumental’ in shifting the emphasis of the day to problem\-based and enquiry\-based learning \[ **R1**\], a shift that has been facilitated by sessions delivered by Lynch, Smith and Strømmen, along with other members of the University of Chichester \[ **C1**\]. 

 The event was attended by 80 students from 6 secondary schools in West Sussex and Hampshire. Lynch and Strømmen drew on Smith’s enquiry\-based approach to deliver sessions on the nature of religion \[ **R3**\] and biblical reception history \[ **R4**\] respectively. The Cathedral A\-Level Study Day continued over 2016\-2018, with sessions expanding to include a talk on the connections between race and religion \[ **R3**\]. This addition provided an opportunity to explore a vital issue that can too easily slip past the A\-Level curriculum, in which race, if addressed at all, is presented as an ethical issue. This session helped students appreciate different philosophical understandings of the idea of ‘race’ that underpin racism, and the way that religion informs that concept. One teacher noted that Lynch’s session helped students make sense of a political climate that included Trump and Brexit \[ **C2**\]. Cynara Davies, Chichester Cathedral’s Education Officer, stated that the event helped students to explore theological, philosophical and ethical questions beyond the A\-Level syllabus \[ **C3**\]. 

 In addition to this initiative, the Department has worked since 2015 to develop new ways of promoting the study of theology, philosophy and religion with local and regional schools. In 2016, Smith worked with local teachers to establish a South Coast branch of the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education \(NATRE\). Through conversations with this network, Smith agreed to work with Angela Smith \(Bishop Luffa School\) and in collaboration with teachers and Year 9 student representatives from regional schools to run a Youth Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education \(SACRE\) conference. Again, G. Smith’s work on problem\-based and enquiry\-based learning \[ **R1**\] shaped the approach of the conference as he supported A. Smith in the organisation of the event \[ **C4**\]. G. Smith and Lynch met with teachers and students representing Bishop Luffa \(Chichester\), St Andrew’s CE High School \(Worthing\) and Davison CE High School \(Worthing\) in autumn 2016 and spring 2017. The first Youth SACRE was held in 2017 and included Year 8 participants from the organising schools, as well as from Bourne Community College \(Southbourne\), The Regis School \(Bognor Regis\), Felpham Community College and The Weald Community School \(Billingshurst\). The University provided facilities, design services, catering and logistical support. Speakers at the conference, in keeping with G. Smith’s popular public theology \[ **R1**, **R2**\], included regional faith leaders from Baha’i, Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, Humanist, Jewish and Quaker communities, as well as advocates for humanism, Prevent Officers, prison chaplains, scientists and a representative of the charity Catholic Agency for Overseas Development. G. Smith continued to support the Youth SACRE conference in 2018 and 2019. Each year, the conference has expanded, and it now includes participants from Holy Trinity \(Crawley\) and Steyning Grammar School. In 2020 it was cancelled due to COVID\-19. 

 During this period of expanding connections with schools, Lynch visited classrooms at Bohunt School and St Philip Howard Catholic School to deliver sessions utilising Smith’s approach \[ **R1**, **R2**\] to help students explore their conceptions of religion, identity, ethics and hope in a world increasingly marked by economic, political and ecological crises. In 2015\-2017 he also attended workshops at Mill Chase Academy using a similar approach. These sessions drew on Lynch’s work on identity \[ **R3**\] to help students explore challenging questions and to support teachers in developing strategies for teaching sensitive topics \[ **C5**\]. 

 In working with students at Cathedral Days, Youth SACRE conferences and during school visits, it became clear that there was a general curiosity about and fear of climate change. In response to conversations with students and their teachers, Lynch began to incorporate elements of his research on climate change \[ **R5**\], which were also made available in more accessible public writings \(see ‘ [Why Climate Change Discussions Need Apocalyptic Thinking](https://slate.com/technology/2017/07/why-climate-change-discussions-need-apocalyptic-thinking.html)’ and ‘ [Climate Apocalypticism](https://politicaltheology.com/climate-apocalypticism/)’\). In 2017, he visited Bohunt School in Hampshire to discuss his research on hope, climate change and ethics. The session employed aspects of Smith’s techniques \[ **R1**, **R2**\] and was praised by Briggs for extending their learning and expanding their notion of philosophy \[ **C7**\]. 

 In 2016, Lynch ran a series of workshops employing enquiry\-based learning \[ **R1**\] exploring religion, multiculturalism and ‘Fundamental British Values’ \(FBV\). Students were invited to explore the tensions that emerge in trying to balance competing FBV, such as ‘Respect and Tolerance’ and ‘Individual Liberty’. Delivered in the midst of Donald Trump’s election and rising tensions around Brexit, the goal was to move students beyond familiar ideas of diversity and freedom in order to reflect on their values and how they embody those values in everyday life. The workshop used a series of short case studies based on recent news events in which 2 or more values were brought into conflict, as well as the future of FBV in a society facing challenges that include multiculturalism \[ **R3**\] and climate change \[ **R5**\]. The first workshop was held at the University of Chichester with c. 90 GCSE students from Mill Chase Academy. In 2017, Lynch ran the workshops again at Angmering School, providing opportunities for 280 Year 8 students to explore religion and ethics in the context of their status as a ‘rights respecting school’. As one student noted, ‘It made me think more deeply about how we should respect other cultures and religions, people too’ \[ **C6**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Intelligent Mobility \(IM\) is the optimised movement of people and goods. In the transport sector, where industry is increasingly reliant on technology and data to facilitate movement of people and services, the challenge is how to address complete end\-to\-end journeys, particularly in rural hard\-to\-access areas. At the University of Aberdeen, the Centre for Transport Research, in collaboration with the School of Natural & Computing Sciences, has undertaken innovative research which has underpinned the development of shared mobility models to enhance transport services for populations in hard to serve areas and informed UK government implementation of internet access in rural areas. The research has also contributed to the growing national interest in Mobility as a Service \(MaaS\), leading to GBP2,000,000 investment from government and the development of proof of concept with industry. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Intelligent Mobility \(IM\) – using novel ideas and new innovative technologies to transport people and goods in an easier, more efficient and more environmentally\-friendly way – is a growing global market. In fact, research has shown that, by 2030, this global industry could be worth as much as GBP1,400,000,000,000, bringing benefits to governments, corporations, and the travelling public around the world. Whilst urban residents will be able to take advantage of new mobility services – which depend on reliable and equitable digital access – rural communities, including those in the UK, will be far less able to benefit fully from these advances, as a result of poor digital and physical connectivity. 

 Expanding capability and embracing technology\-centred services can bring certain challenges such as developing effective communication networks with passengers on social media and providing an enhanced customer experience whilst protecting the privacy of their personal data.  Multi\-disciplinary research at Aberdeen’s Centre for Transport Research \(CTR\) has brought together experts from Transport, Engineering \(Nelson, Cottrill\) and Computing Science \(Edwards\) in order to facilitate better understanding amongst policymakers and industry representatives of how people– in different settings \(urban/ rural\) – will benefit from and adapt to IM. 

 Research led by CTR has been carried out in four main areas: 

 **1. Understanding the basis of digital exclusion** \[P1, P6\]: 

 Research led by CTR \(Nelson, Edwards, Cottrill, Farrington\) under the Rural Digital Economy Hub \(funded from the Research Councils UK’s Digital Economy Programme, led by the EPSRC\) \[P1\] examined instances of digital exclusion in rural areas of the UK \[3\] and its impact on the availability of IM services to these traditionally under\-served populations \[1\]. Importantly, the research showed that digital limitations could act as a considerable barrier to implementing more efficient mobility practices across the UK, and that providing accessibility and connectivity to rural communities presented significant challenges because of combined problems of transport poverty and digital exclusion \[3\]. These problems were found to include a strong technological/ technical component common to both the transport and digital spheres in terms of the quality and availability of infrastructure and services \[1\]. In 2017, Cottrill was commissioned by Foresight, UK Government Office for Science, to outline the potential long\-term implications of these connectivity limitations for transport and mobility opportunities in the UK \[P6, S6\]. Cottrill outlined opportunities for enabling more inclusive access such as the development of adequate digital skills across end users to ensure widespread uptake of digital transport services, development of a workforce with more targeted digital skills to ensure the continuing design and implementation of digital transport systems and data management/handling as a key component of transport network design, development and implementation \[P6\]. 

 **2a. Understanding efficient information provision** \[P2\]:** 

 As part of an ESRC funded project, through a linked series of interdisciplinary studies using semi\-structured interviews and qualitative analysis \[P2\], CTR \(Nelson, Edwards, Cottrill\) addressed issues of transport information provision through analysis of social media data \[4\], and ethnographic evaluation of passenger experience \[2\], leading to the development of ‘TravelBot’ a Twitter\-based tool for sending, receiving and sharing travel disruption information in collaboration with FirstGroup, the world’s largest public transport operator \[7\]. Via the Twitter application programming interface \(API\), the team developed a Twitter Monitoring Infrastructure to collect the Tweets sent from and mentioning the accounts of subsidiary companies. By applying content analysis to the data, they demonstrated as proof of principle, that information sharing between passengers and transport providers using mobile phones and digital social media can significantly improve passenger satisfaction using minimal digital resources. The research found that this was particularly important in rural areas as it helped to overcome transport information limitations and improved access to the available transport supply \[7\]. 

  

 **2b. Proof of concept studies** \[P4\]:** 

 The EU Horizon 2020 ‘Easily diStributed Personal RapId Transit’ \(ESPRIT\) project \[P4\] led by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission \(CEA\) was an innovative 16\-partner pan\-EU collaboration to develop purpose\-built, lightweight, stackable electric vehicles. As part of this project, CTR \(Nelson\) led work on work package 8: the dissemination, demonstration and exploitation activities of the project in preparation for commercialising the ESPRIT concept as part of its ‘realisation’ phase. As a proof of concept, Nelson worked with research partners FirstGroup to develop lightweight, stackable electric vehicles designed for efficient one\-way car\-sharing journeys in areas difficult to serve by public transport \[5\]. Prototypes of the vehicles were successfully demonstrated in France \(Lyon\), Spain \(Barcelona\) and Glasgow in 2018 with commercial exploitation expected by 2022. 

 **2c. Travel Demand** \[P5\]:** 

 SocialCar, a Horizon2020 project \[P5\] coordinated by FIT Consulting SRL \(Italy\) aimed to develop a new communication network for IM that would share carpooling information integrated with existing transport and mobility systems in order to provide end\-users with a simplified travel experience and allow comparison and choice between multiple travel options. CTR research \(Nelson, Cottrill\) underpinned the development of a new journey planning App \( *RideMyRoute*\), available on the App store. Whilst this was a concept phase project it has outlined the potential long\-term implications of connectivity limitations for transport and mobility opportunities in the UK and identified opportunities for enabling more inclusive access in rural area \[6\]. By introducing a new intermodal trip planning algorithm and supporting data structure, CTR staff contributed to outlining features that could increase the attractiveness of MaaS options in suburban markets. The app, trialled in four European test sites, demonstrated capacity to suggest trip planning solutions and that 85% of these solutions involved connection from carpool to public transport.  The project brought together ITS developers, social scientists, economists, transport engineers, car\-poolers and public authorities from the UK and 12 other European countries.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Intelligent mobility has the potential to transform the ways we move people and goods. Research at the University of Aberdeen has shed new light on the development and provision of new transport services, particularly in relation to rural communities and passenger experience. This research has informed digital infrastructure requirements in the UK, raised awareness of innovation in transport services, secured investment from the Scottish government to pilot new services, and enabled operators and industries to rationalise the transition to IM. 

 **Creating an evidence base for national digital policy decisions** 

 Through research on Internet access and use in rural and urban areas in the UK \[3\], CTR has raised awareness of the impact of low\-speed broadband connection on people’s use of the internet, highlighting the implications for availability of IM to both policymakers and industry in collaboration with the University of Oxford Internet Institute \(OxIS\), which releases a biannual survey of internet use.  The portion of the OxIS 2011 sample that falls within areas defined by UK, Scottish and Welsh administrations as being in some degree ‘rural’ or ‘remote rural’ is about 200 individuals \- insufficient to provide a sound basis for large\-scale generalisations about rural Internet use and the effect on the potential for Digital Economy in rural Britain. 

 CTR collaborated with OxIS to release the 2013 Oxford Internet Survey, which directly engaged with users by conducting interviews with a representative sample of 800 rural residents across Britain, ensuring robust analysis of the data generated in order to gain better understanding of barriers to Internet use related to, for example, age, income, education, and location\-specific technology limitations \[3\]. The survey was launched following a workshop in October 2013, where findings were discussed with speakers from Ofcom and the Scottish Government. In 2019, Oxford Internet Survey released a follow\-up survey supported by the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Google Inc. and BT, stating that ‘ *the oversample \(from the 2013 survey\) was critical since there are a relatively small proportion of deep rural households in Britain*’ \[S1\]. 

 In 2013, CTR was invited to submit written evidence to a small\-scale enquiry led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\) titled ‘Rural Broadband and digital\-only services’, the outcome of which was to ensure the ‘hardest to reach’ would be given priority access to broadband \[S2\]. The inquiry was updated and broadened \(2017\-2019\), concluding that current Government policy had failed to reduce the digital divide between urban and rural areas. The report drew on Aberdeen research to highlight digital public services such as farm governance activities as being one of the areas being affected by lack of digital infrastructure \[S3; 60, p15\] to underpin recommendation 7 \[S3; ‘ *future digital services policies should reflect “needs not numbers” to ensure that the rural minority had the same digital opportunities as the urban majority*‘. \[S3; 73, p16\] In March 2020, the UK Government issued an official response to the committee’s findings agreeing that ‘Government must actively monitor, encourage, and where appropriate, intervene to ensure that rural areas are not left behind and that any ‘digital’ divide between rural and urban areas can be closed’, confirming that in response to recommendation 7, that the development team ‘is already undertaking user research with farmers with no internet connection and poor mobile phone connectivity’ \[S4\]. 

 CTR \(Cottrill\) was a key contributor to the underpinning evidence\-based study that underpins the Transport Systems Catapult 2016 report, ‘Intelligent Mobility Skills Strategy’ \(https://ts.catapult.org.uk/imskills/\), which was cited in Parliament in 2017, with Dr Yolande Herbath, the Catapult’s strategic lead, informing debate and the government round table on future skills. The University of Aberdeen’s Centre for Transport Research \(CTR\) was involved with the Transport Systems Catapult \(TSC\) under the University Partner Programme \(UPP\) from 2014 to 2017 \[P3\]. During this time, CTR undertook a significant range of activities with the Catapult and external partners, including organising and leading knowledge exchange activities and facilitating connections with partners in Scotland. These activities drew upon findings from research conducted by CTR with core relevance to intelligent mobility and contributed to activities undertaken by TSC. 

 As a direct impact of the IM Skills Strategy, the Department for Transport commissioned the Connected Places Catapult \(the TSC’s successor organisation\) to undertake a study on foresighting the Future of Transport Skills, the outcomes of which will be published in Spring, 2021 \(https://bit.ly/3eozqyr\). The Automotive Council’s Skills Working Group revisited its governance arrangements \(2020\) reflecting shifting their focus from short\-term solutions to plug gaps and address immediate stressors to the longer term horizon \[S5\]. 

 In 2018, Cottrill was commissioned by the UK government’s Foresight Future of Mobility Project to prepare a report titled, ‘Data and Digital Systems for UK Transport: Change and its Implications’ \[S6\], which is cited as commissioned work, underpinning the report titled, ‘A time of unprecedented change in the transport system: The Future of Mobility’ \(2019\) prepared by the office of Sir Patrick Vallance \(Government Chief Scientific Advisor since 2018\) \[S7\] to ‘inform the UK’s response to a range of challenges and opportunities’. 

 **Securing government investment to pilot Mobility as a Service \(MaaS\)** 

 Aberdeen CTR has adopted an interdisciplinary approach in line with MaaS Scotland \(Mobility as a Service \(MaaS\) Alliance Scotland\), which is a network of 75 public and private organisations operating across the MaaS supply chain in Scotland. MaaS Scotland is a partnership between Technology Scotland and ScotlandIS and brings together businesses in the transport sector to share knowledge and develop joint projects to demonstrate the commercial, environmental and social advantages of MaaS.  MaaS Scotland therefore plays a major role in the evolving development of IM, based on research findings that incorporate improved information systems and better integration of transport supply and demand. 

 In 2018, MaaS Scotland submitted a paper to the Scottish Government calling for investment to support MaaS pilot projects throughout Scotland. As a result of the research, the Scottish Government made an investment of GBP2,000,000 in 2019, administered through Transport Scotland, to support the development of these pilot projects. Alongside the fund, a Scottish Government working group was established to develop and scope how the investment should be spent, which included identifying thematic areas, refining evaluation criteria, and ensuring maximum engagement from industry partners. CTR, through one of its PhD students, provided an important voice to this group, helping to create a programme that looks set to significantly advance MaaS development and deployment in Scotland. According to the Chief Executive Officer for Technology Scotland: 

 ‘*CTR has been central to the creation of a separate working group on rural MaaS. This is a hugely important subject, particularly in Scotland where the rural economy plays such an important role.*’ \[S8\] 

 **Enabling operators and industry to rationalise the transition to IM** 

 Central to the IM concept is journey planning, which includes the need to integrate existing data sources and formats. Nelson, Cottrill and colleagues worked with FirstGroup plc, the leading provider of transport services in the UK and North America, to develop a social media strategy to provide journey disruption alerts. FirstGroup have confirmed that CTR’s research has influenced both their engagement with research and helped to provide a roadmap for market readiness, stating that CTR ‘ *have assisted First in its understanding of the scope for, and application, of innovative public transport solutions in real world scenarios. These form part of our wider objective, to achieve growth in use of and modal shift to public transport’* \[S9\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Oakes’s research draws on archaeological and textual evidence to provide new insights into the social diversity of early Christian communities. The research has had an impact on: \(1\) Christian communicators, who draw on the research to encourage audiences to consider *realia* of ancient life and the diversity of early Christian communities in order to better understand and use the New Testament \(NT\); \(2\) trainers who have used the research to develop learning programmes for trainee church practitioners; \(3\) individual learners and members of church study groups, whose understanding of NT life has been enhanced; \(4\) Christian group leaders who have adopted the research to underpin and articulate their organisations’ policies. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 When Christians have envisaged the members of early Christian groups, commonly seen as paradigmatic for current practice, they have generally done so in an unrealistically undifferentiated way. Oakes’s research across the period 2000\-2016 held the central tenet that the varied lives of first\-century Christians in the Graeco\-Roman world are critical to understanding New Testament \(NT\) texts. His work involves close engagement with archaeological evidence of first\-century non\-elite housing \[1, 2\]; mathematical modelling of the socio\-economic profiles of first\-century Christian groups \(typically ‘house churches’\) \[1, 3\]; and reading of NT texts in relation to these profiles as expected hearers—including reading these texts among the remains of Roman houses \[1, 3\]. The research has significantly challenged scholarly and popular conceptions of house churches in the Roman empire as undifferentiated collections of Christians, drawing attention to significant diversity in the social make\-up of these groups. 

 Oakes’s early research at Philippi in northern Greece produced a new model of the Christian community that lived there: the first Christian group in Europe and the original recipients of one of Saint Paul’s epistles \[3\]. The research generated a demographic model of the church \(probably the first so detailed one for any such community\) with its diverse, non\-elite, non\-military, social make\-up, based on Oakes’s demographic modelling of the city population. 

 With funding from AHRC and in\-kind support from the British School of Art and Archaeology at Rome, Oakes used the uniquely\-preserved evidence of first\-century life at Pompeii to rethink the early Christian communities in Rome and elsewhere \[1, 2\]. Calculations of space\-distribution in the Vesuvian town produced the ‘model craftworker house church’ \[1\]. The model has challenged earlier conceptions of ancient urban Christian groups that commonly assumed ‘poor’ Christians were meeting either in the big houses of a few elite members, or as egalitarian groups in squalid apartments. Oakes’s research argued that the house church would typically have comprised a diverse range of \(up to a few dozen\) members from non\-elite strata of society: entire and part households \(including slaves\), individuals from non\-Christian families and people without family contact—a range of members whose age, occupation, gender and legal status would determine their experience of life in the Christian community and its challenges \[1, 4, 5\]. 

 A key vehicle enabling the above research to be accessed by a wide range of Christian educators and lay people has been Oakes’s creation of imagined first\-century characters representative of particular social types and situations \[1, 3\]. These social types—from Sabina the Stoneworker to Primus the Bathstoker—are expressed in imaginatively ‘thick’ description but rooted in rigorous engagement with archaeological and textual evidence.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Oakes’s research has provided public communicators, such as Christian writers, preachers and trainers, with a new paradigm for explaining both social diversity among the early Christians and the implications of that diversity for understanding of NT texts. There is also evidence of enhanced public understanding and of shaping and presentation of institutional policy. The significance and reach of the impact spans the range of historic denominational divisions and theological perspectives, including groups on both sides of modern ‘culture wars’, although people who have consciously deployed Oakes’s research into that sphere have done so one\-sidedly in support of community diversity. 

##  1. Changing the communicative paradigm for Christian writers and preachers 

 The research informed Paula Gooder’s novelisation of the life of one of Paul’s co\-workers in *Phoebe: A Story* \(Hodder & Stoughton/IVP Academic, 2018\). In a testimonial, Gooder, author and Chancellor of St Paul’s Cathedral, states that Oakes’s research “ *gave me the idea of a different genre of theological communication which has proved to be very popular…It framed the exegesis of Romans in a different way allowing a new way into the text*.” \[A.i\] Sales of *Phoebe* to January 2020 are approximately 12,500 in the UK \(with additional US sales\). The book is being translated into Danish, Dutch and Korean. Novelisation of Bible stories goes back centuries. Oakes’s paradigm shift is in expressing early Christian communities through archaeology\-based socio\-economic models, instantiated through imagined characters that represent types within the model, then interpreting the text through interaction with the model and the character types. This provides a fresh, more historically rooted and rounded route to novelising. Because Oakes’s approach has a grounded interpretative pay\-off for contemporary readers who view Paul’s letters as guides for life, the novel can effectively carry such pay\-offs too, crucial for Gooder as a church\-based communicator. For instance, in a published interview, Gooder states: “ *what life was like for slaves…was hard to write but felt really important… many people today…suffer similar experiences through modern slavery, abusive relationships and so on…. In this area I was inspired by Peter Oakes’ writing \(especially* Reading Romans in Pompeii \[1\] *\) where he explores what it would have felt like for different people to hear parts of Paul’s message”* \[A.ii\]. 

 Oakes’s models also newly resource communication to children, seen in Paul’s vividly populated social world \(e.g. p. 82, using  \[3\]\) in the 2017 children’s book, *Paul: Man on a Mission: The Life and Letters of an Adventurer for Jesus* \(Lion Hudson/Kregel\) by Baptist youth leader and writer Bob Hartman and theological trainer Conrad Gempf. The book’s debt to Oakes’s research is acknowledged by the dedication: to *“Peter Oakes, whose work showed the way”*. 

 In 2019, Neil Hudson, Pentecostal Minister and Director of Church Relationships at London Institute of Contemporary Christianity \(LICC\), a prominent public training and media organisation, published a how\-to book for training in churches, *Scattered and Gathered: Equipping Disciples for the Frontline* \(IVP, 2019\). Central to Hudson’s strategy is the operation of small mid\-week groups, explained in a chapter explicitly based on Oakes’s group model and its implications for reading Romans 12 \(citing \[1\] at pp. 98\-126\). Also from LICC, three times since 2016 the *Word for the Week* blog and email \(approximately 14,500 subscribers\) by Antony Billington, their then Head of Theology and an Evangelical Free Church Minister, has presented the dilemmas of Holconius the cabinet\-maker, one of Oakes’s social\-type characters \[1\] \[B.i\]. In each case, Oakes’s research provides not only the communicative strategy but also the topics \(self\-worth, mutual support, revenge\) and NT interpretation. These pieces are also syndicated in church newsletters via Parish Pump \( [www.parishpump.co.uk](http://www.parishpump.co.uk/)\) \[e.g. B.ii\], which has a circulation of approximately 400,000 in the UK, Europe and South Pacific, across Anglican, Baptist, United Reformed and Methodist churches \[B.iii\]. 

 Scot McKnight, a Baptist NT scholar who is among those most read by church ministers and lay people \(approximately 48,600 Twitter followers\), has made regular use of Oakes’s research since his November 2013 blog post that *“Oakes has offered to us a new way of thinking more realistically and concretely about who was in the earliest house churches”* \[C.i\]. Two of McKnight’s 2019 church\-facing publications, *Reading Romans Backwards: A Gospel of Peace in the Midst of Empire* \(Baylor UP\) and *Preaching Romans* \(Eerdmans\), are heavily indebted to \[1\]. As he notes on the first page of *Reading Romans Backwards,* the book’s whole approach is related to Oakes’s but uses clues in Romans 14\-15 to reshape its model group. In the practical essay collection, *Preaching Romans,* McKnight’s model sermon contribution reads Romans 4 and the Anglican tradition of Passing the Peace via the question of how to analyse these in relation to Oakes’s model. *Reading Romans in Pompeii* \[1\], *Reading Romans Backwards* and *Preaching Romans* are the second, fourth and fifth of the ‘5 Books Every Pastor Should Read’ on Romans in Nijay Gupta’s widely read Crux Sola blog \[C.ii\]. 

 Oakes’s models enable preachers to open their congregations’ eyes to early Christian diversity and its implications. For example, a 2018 sermon at Selsdon Baptist Church, Surrey, hinged around a slide listing the types of people in Oakes’s model craftworker house church. Oakes’s model was used to contrast a football coach quote, longing for a team full of Ronaldos, with Paul’s approach in Romans 12 \[D.i\]. A 2017 sermon at White Plains Presbyterian Church in New York used Oakes’s model to encourage the church to consider the implications of the diversity of Paul’s hearers and the *realia* of their lives \[D.ii\]. Oakes’s models also change the mode in which preachers can set up the ancient context of NT books for sermon series. Instead of general geographic and historical data, preachers can introduce the types of community for which each text was composed. Sources \[D.iii\] and \[D.iv\] are Lutheran and Methodist examples using \[1\] and \[3\] for churches at Rome and Philippi. 

##  2. Generating new and engaging Christian training in professional and lay settings 

 McKnight, as well as reaching Christian communities through books and Twitter, is one of several of the world’s most prominent theological trainers specialising in Paul’s letters for whom Oakes’s research has shaped the basic structure of major courses they teach. Oakes’s research provides the first aim of McKnight’s New Testament Contextual Theology course at Northern Seminary, Illinois *: “To practice reading Romans 12–16 in the context of how Romans could be read in a typical Roman city – and we will use Pompeii \(see P. Oakes assignment\).”* \[E.i\] Approximately 700 trainees took this course between 2013 and 2020 \[E.i\]. 

 Roman Catholic, Mark Reasoner, at Marian \(Franciscan\) University, Indiana, uses a video\-interview with Oakes alongside \[1\] for an approach to Paul’s letters that aims to be more sensitive to material conditions and social realities of ordinary, first\-century life. Approximately 90 students in total took the course in 2019 and 2020, of which approximately half were church trainees \[E.ii\]. Measurable benefits to participants in a 2020 survey at Marian University include a rise in the number agreeing or strongly agreeing that “I can picture what everyday life was like for first\-century Christians” from 8/42 surveyed prior to using Oakes’s materials to 14/22 after. Similarly, for “I can talk about how the New Testament relates to the conditions of first\-century life”, the figure rose from 9/42 to 16/22 \[E.iii\]. One participant in a 2019 survey wrote, *“I now see that the NT must be kept in the perspective of whoever is hearing it. I am more sensitive now to diverse audiences because I see one person might react differently to certain parts of the NT than another.”* Another participant commented *: “The words of a text are going to be perceived differently by people of varying backgrounds, so it's important to see how the writings affected the different groups. You can always learn from someone else”* \[E.iii\]. 

 At St Mary’s Ecumenical Institute, Baltimore, Michael Gorman’s Cities of Paul course includes site visits to Pompeii that use \[1\] as the key preparatory reading to help *“make the New Testament come alive for students by experiencing the \(ruins of\) the material world of the first century and connecting that experience to actual texts”* \[E.iv\]. The most recent course had 18 students, including a Catholic priest, a Protestant minister, teachers in church contexts and a writer of religious books. Gorman writes: *“Oakes’s work gave the students categories to use in their thinking and understanding of social realities that they had not previously known. I am sure the experience was highly informative for all students and paradigm\-forming, or \-altering, for most”* \[E.iv\]. 

 Lay Christian communicators and clergy have also used Oakes’s research to provide new learning events for their communities. For example, a 2017 Christadelphian summer school at Fircroft College in Birmingham, run by members of different Christadelphian churches in the UK, adopted Oakes’s models and imagined characters to study Colossians \( *sic*\). The workshop was attended by 12 church members, many of whom lead lay activities in their own church \[F\]. One participant then started using the same approach to give further presentations, sharing Oakes’s research with churches of various denominations and social groups around central southern England. Some participants at these events have, in turn, led similar teaching activities for other groups \[F\]. 

##  3. Producing a step\-change in understanding by individuals and study groups 

 Sales of \[1\] are 2,561 \(to June 2020\) plus many packaged licensed copies. Its accessible style enables direct sales to the public. An online review comment demonstrates new understanding: *“I walked away…with new eyes that help me to see Romans in a richer more complex and far more practical way than I've ever seen it.”* \[G\] The same is true of a participant comment from a public teaching event in 2017 using Oakes’s research: “ *By focusing on ‘real’ individuals whose lives can be recreated from…archaeological evidence… the workshop not only brought some imaginary early Christian converts to life, but also shed fresh new light on Paul’s letter”* \[F\]. 

 To further develop direct public access to the research, Oakes created an open\-access online resource aimed at church groups and individual members of the public, ‘Entering Early Christianity via Pompeii’ \[H.i\]. Between November 2019 and June 2020, the site received 2,272 visits, including 1,455 distinct users \[H.ii\]. Initial public feedback indications match those for the Marian University students using the same resource \[E.iii\] but, if anything, with a higher proportion of participants reporting significant changes in understanding. 

##  4. Shaping organisational policy and its presentation 

 Christian group leaders have adopted Oakes’s research on social diversity in early churches to underpin and help articulate their organisations’ policies. The reach is international, with documented instances in three continents. A 2018 online teaching pack by Matthew Heesing, Turner Valley, CA and Christ Fellowship church in Texas, uses Oakes’s work as a resource for teaching which legitimates these communities’ core attitudes on diversity \[I.i\]. Another Christ Fellowship church teaching pack cites Oakes in its encouragement to members to challenge discriminative attitudes. Tackling issues of diversity is central to the agenda of Maastricht’s Damascus Road International Church. In their 2017 blog, \[1\] is the reference point when relating diversity in their community to that of early Christian communities: **“**we have a huge variety in cultures, nationalities, denominations, and backgrounds… much closer to how the church was intended to operate”* \[I.ii\]. Oakes’s analysis of the economic challenges faced by his characters provided Judith Gardiner \(Anabaptist\) with the basis for discussions at Wood Green Mennonite Church, London, on how money is used in the church \[I.iii\]. 

 The Kerusso Trust \(2019 income GBP110,000; net assets GBP810,000 \[J\]\) operates a ministry training course in Malawi and supports a girls’ secondary school and other activities. Its key founding trustee, Jonathan Groves, describes *“the whole approach of the charity’s trustees”* as informed by a *“three horizon”* approach, applying parallels between NT responses to the situations of Paul’s original readers in first\-century Rome \(the first horizon\) and those of modern congregations in rural Malawi \(the third horizon\) \[second is Western scholarship\] \[J\]. He sets out the approach in his 2015 book, *Reading Romans at Ground Level: A Contemporary Rural African Perspective* \(title cf. \[1\]\) which systemically uses cases from Oakes’s work to illuminate issues *“faced by churches in rural Malawi*” and thus to identify ways in which *“Paul's message can be meaningful*” \[J\] in that context. In a testimonial provided in 2020, Groves writes that \[1\] *“inspired my imagination into how* \[Romans\] *might be interpreted faithfully, practically and contextually in rural Africa. This was key in helping us establish the framework for our biblically informed leadership training programmes. Over the past eight years, these programmes have gone on to train 1000s of church and community leaders across Malawi, who otherwise would have no access to such training.”* \[J\]

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The risks from human\-caused climate change are global in scope and may become unrivalled in magnitude. These complex changes in climate are often encapsulated by a single metric: the global\-mean temperature change. Our research has generated one of the official sources quantifying changes in global temperature including a detailed evaluation of the uncertainties. Our global temperature record demonstrates that the current decade is 1.1±0.1 °C warmer than the pre\-industrial baseline. This research has been used in all major international assessments of climate change that underpin the development of national and international climate mitigation policy. The long\-term goals of the primary policy, the Paris Agreement, are defined by global temperature limits and our research has been used to track progress with respect to these goals and thus also informs critical targets for global reductions of carbon emissions. Our impact has, therefore, been on the development of public policy and evaluating the progress towards the policy goals.

 2. Underpinning research 

 UEA’s research into changes in Earth’s global surface temperature began in the 1980s at the Climatic Research Unit \(CRU, part of the School of Environmental Sciences\) led by Professor **Phil Jones**, and more recently by Professor **Tim Osborn**. This research produces the *land* air temperature dataset \(CRUTEM **\[R1, R2\]**\) that, through close collaboration, is combined with *sea* surface temperature data from the Met Office. The resultant global temperature dataset \(HadCRUT **\[R3, R4\]**\) is one of three main products commonly used to monitor global warming by international organisations such as the World Meteorological Organisation \(WMO\) and the United Nations \(UN\). HadCRUT is part of the WMO’s Catalogue for Climate Data, as “ *a trustworthy source for climate data… assessed through an internationally agreed maturity evaluation process*” \( [climatedata\-catalogue.wmo.int](https://climatedata-catalogue.wmo.int/)\). 

 Estimating global temperature from raw data that were not explicitly designed for climate monitoring purposes, and that therefore suffer from time\-varying biases in the measurements and from incomplete geographical coverage, is a significant research challenge that we have addressed over several decades. Having multiple independent datasets, including HadCRUT **\[R3, R4\]**, is essential to demonstrate that the temperature record is robust to different methodological choices. Aspects of our approach that make HadCRUT distinct from other datasets \(and therefore a critical part of this multi\-dataset ensemble\) are: \(i\) it is the longest established land and sea dataset \(first combined in 1986\); \(ii\) it spans the longest time period \(1850 to present\) getting closer to the pre\-industrial baseline chosen by policymakers **\[R5\]**; \(iii\) we utilise homogenization efforts undertaken by national or regional initiatives, which benefits from knowledge of local circumstances and additional observing stations, rather than applying statistical algorithms to identify and correct for inhomogeneities **\[R2\]**; and \(iv\) we have developed a comprehensive error model to deal with the multiple and interacting sources of potential error **\[R3, R4\]**. Our research demonstrates that warming far exceeds any uncertainty in the record. 

 Ongoing UEA research has allowed us to: \(I\) incorporate newly digitized or compiled measurements \(a recent expansion from 4842 to 7983 weather stations, led by **David Lister**\) **\[R4\]**; \(II\) create an ensemble of 200 alternative realisations to represent the uncertainties **\[R4\]**; \(III\) address biases arising from limited sampling of the fast\-warming Arctic region by first acquiring more high\-latitude data **\[R2\]** and then interpolating to obtain a spatially complete dataset \(the HadCRUT5 Analysis **\[R4\]**\). 

 The Paris Agreement expressed global temperature changes relative to a *“pre\-industrial baseline”* but did not define this baseline. Therefore, in collaboration with the University of Reading and others, we made a more thorough assessment of the warming since the pre\-industrial baseline to provide a better estimate of our remaining headroom to the Paris Agreement goals **\[R5\]**. Our ongoing research has continually improved and refined our estimates of global warming. It shows that the 2011\-20 decade was 1.1±0.1 °C warmer than pre\-industrial. 

 Alongside Earth’s surface temperature, changes and variability in other fundamental meteorological variables \(precipitation, vapour pressure, cloud cover\) have also been determined by research at UEA’s CRU. This has enabled the creation of a complementary and higher spatial resolution dataset \(CRU TS **\[R6\]**, led by **Ian Harris**\) to better reveal regional climate changes for multiple climate variables over land, and to derive indices for monitoring drought. CRU TS is one of the most widely used datasets in climate science **\[R6\]**, supporting the monitoring and analysis of variability and trends in hydroclimate, critical for many climate impacts, and relied upon as input to model simulations of terrestrial carbon fluxes for tracking the fate of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 

 All these datasets are routinely updated and disseminated via open\-access data centres and Google Earth interfaces. Output citations and data download statistics demonstrate their importance and reach \(Scopus citation counts on 29/1/21 were 1058 for **\[R2\]**, 1416 for **\[R3\]**, 4849 for **\[R6\]**\). The importance of these datasets has been recognised as essential work and now receives long\-term funding from the UK’s National Centre for Atmospheric Science \(NCAS\) to sustain it.

 4. Details of the impact 

 Our research has had impact on public policy, because it is a significant part of the science underpinning the development of national and international climate mitigation policy. Our impact is also on the engagement that is necessary for the global public to support such ambitious and far\-reaching policies. The ultimate benefit of these climate mitigation policies will be reducing the adverse impacts of climate change on society and the environment. 

 **Impact on public policy: international climate mitigation policy** 

 The 2015 Paris Agreement is the flagship international climate mitigation policy: all governments agreed to limit global warming to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. These goals are considered crucial to “ *significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change*” and they are defined in terms of global\-mean temperature changes relative to a pre\-industrial baseline, which our research has now better defined **\[R5\]**. 

 The Paris Agreement was negotiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\). The UNFCCC is a science\-based convention and uses the “ *information in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) reports as a baseline on the state of knowledge on climate change when making science\-based decisions*” **\[S1, S2\]**. The UNFCCC also commissioned the IPCC to assess the science related to the Paris Agreement. It is through the IPCC reports that our research has influenced the Paris Agreement and policies to implement it **\[S2\]**. 

 Our HadCRUT global temperature record **\[R3\]** has appeared in the Summary for Policy Makers and Synthesis Report of all five IPCC assessments, most recently in the fifth assessment report \(AR5, **\[S3\]**\). HadCRUT4 data features in the overall Synthesis Report **\[S3\]** and the Summary for Policy Makers of the Working Group I \(WGI\) report **\[S4\]**. Our research on global **\[R3\]** and land **\[R2\]** temperature is cited in Chapter 2 of the accompanying WGI report **\[S4\]**. The co\-chair of IPCC WGI \(2008 to 2015\) confirms the importance of our global temperature record to the IPCC: “ *UEA’s research led to important improvements in this record, especially in the better quantification of its uncertainties and biases, which enabled a more robust IPCC assessment of climate system warming*” **\[S2\]**. 

 Our temperature record together with our new quantification of its uncertainty **\[R3\]** were central lines of evidence for two of IPCC’s most important findings **\[S4\]**. IPCC WGI co\-chair confirms the impact of our global temperature research and data thus: “ *Their global temperature record… was a significant line of evidence for key IPCC AR5 statements… «Warming of the climate system is unequivocal» and «Human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming»*” **\[S2\]**. These are both catalysts for urgent climate mitigation policy. 

 Climate mitigation policy is even more urgent because climate change is already being seen at regional scales and in ways that directly affect social and natural systems. Our CRU TS3.10 dataset **\[R6\]** was used as evidence in IPCC AR5 **\[S4\]** that such changes are underway, particularly that the hydrological cycle has already changed. Specifically, it was used in Chapter 2, with headline findings about precipitation change reported in the WGI Technical Summary \(TFE.1 Fig. 2\) and Summary for Policymakers **\[S4\]**. IPCC WGI co\-chair confirms that CRU TS3.10 “ *was a significant line of evidence underpinning the IPCC assessment of changes to the hydrological cycle… for example, that precipitation in the mid\-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere has increased*” **\[S2\]**. 

 The importance of the IPCC scientific assessment, including the contribution from our research, to development of the Paris Agreement is expressed by IPCC WGI co\-chair: “ *The Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC, especially the WGI SPM and the overall Synthesis Report, which both featured the HadCRUT global temperature record, was an important step towards the development of international climate mitigation policy embodied in the UNFCCC Paris Agreement… This importance arises because the UNFCCC is a science\-based convention which uses IPCC reports as a baseline on the state of knowledge on climate change*” **\[S2\]**. 

 While the IPCC assessments synthesize the underpinning science for these policy negotiations, the temperature targets themselves were agreed following a parallel science\-policy process: the “Structured Expert Dialogue” \(SED\) during 2013–2015. The SED led directly to the strengthening of the previous 2°C target **\[S5\]** and its final report **\[S6\]** used our HadCRUT4 record as evidence in its assessment that warming to date had reached 0.85°C \(the source is given as IPCC 2013 **\[S4\]** which cites our underpinning research **\[R2, R3\]**\). IPCC WGI co\-chair confirms the link to policy development: “ *the SED was the main science\-policy process underpinning the development of the Paris Agreement and it relied entirely on the IPCC fifth assessment report for its scientific baseline*” **\[S2\]**. 

 As well as providing a catalyst for the development of stronger climate mitigation policy, our research provides a measure of progress towards meeting the policy goals \(which are framed as global temperature change limits\) and it critically also provides an observational constraint on the future carbon budget required to meet the temperature target. These were important considerations in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C \(SR1.5 **\[S7a\]**\), which was the first major assessment of the Paris Agreement goals. Our work to better define the pre\-industrial baseline **\[R5\]** was used and cited in this report **\[S7a\]**. Our temperature record **\[R3\]** featured in its Summary for Policymakers to quantify how close historical warming has already come to the 1.5°C goal and to estimate the remaining carbon budget **\[S7a\]**. The UNFCCC welcomed this report and encouraged countries to use it to strengthen their scientific understanding \(decisions 24\-29 of the UNFCCC COP24 **\[S7b\]**\). Thus, our research is now forming part of the science basis for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. 

 The impact is “near\-universal” and truly global as 190 parties have ratified the Paris Climate Agreement, so almost the entire globe. 

 **Impact on public policy: national UK climate mitigation policy** 

 Our evidence of the amount and rate of global and regional European warming **\[R2, R3\]** also underpinned the development of UK climate policy **\[S8\]**. UK government policy on international action for climate change from 2010 to 2015 stated that *“The Earth’s surface has consequently warmed by about 0.8°C since around 1900, with much of this warming occurring in the past 50 years”* **\[S8a\]**. The scientific evidence for this statement comes from our HadCRUT temperature record **\[R3\] \[S8\]**. 

 In 2019, the UK’s 2008 Climate Change Act was strengthened to mandate net\-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Committee on Climate Change’s “Net Zero” report \(May 2019, **\[S9a\]**\) was used as the basis for the 2019 amendment. It begins its presentation of the climate science with the warming already seen as evidenced by our global temperature record **\[R3\]**. The “Net Zero” report **\[S9a\]**, formally requested by the UK Government in 2018 to provide guidance on the timing of UK’s reduction to net\-zero carbon emissions, states as a “key conclusion” that “ *Human activity has already led to 1°C of global warming from pre\-industrial levels which has resulted in damaging impacts on lives, infrastructure and ecosystems that are apparent today*” based on our contribution to the IPCC SR1.5 report **\[S7a\]**. The 2019 amendment to the Climate Change Act “broadly puts into effect” the “Net Zero” recommendation from the Climate Change Committee \(House of Commons Briefing Paper, Dec 2019; **\[S9b\]**\). This chain of evidence corroborates the UK policy impact of our research. 

 **Impact on public understanding and engagement: societal awareness of climate change and the need for mitigation policy** 

 Our global temperature record **\[R3\]** was centre stage in what has been described as “probably the most watched broadcast about the climate ever” **\[S10a\]** – a segment on climate change in the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics. This featured an animated spiral using UEA’s HadCRUT4 dataset showing the rise in temperatures from 1850 to the present, originally created and popularised by Ed Hawkins \(University of Reading\). The International Olympic Committee estimated that 342 million people watched this opening ceremony \(Reuters, **\[S10b\]**\). 

 The climate mitigation policy needed to achieve the aims of the Paris Climate Agreement is so\-wide reaching that it requires the engagement and support of all communities worldwide. Reaching an audience of over a third of a billion people is a significant milestone in raising public understanding of ongoing climate change.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The impacts relate firstly, to creativity culture and society. Collaboration with religious archive custodians and professionals has contributed to significant specific advances in archival infrastructure.  These have attracted substantial financial resource and enhanced the preservation and interpretation of religious heritage, especially through major archive developments at the East London Mosque and Lambeth Palace Library. Secondly, through collaboration with religious and community leaders in London and beyond there have been associated impacts on public understanding, learning and participation.  Wider interest in religious heritage has been stimulated to make a significant contribution to present\-day religious literacy and understanding. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research falls into two categories. First, archival research has addressed problems in religious history. Second, engaged research, conducted in a planned and funded collaboration with stakeholders, has led to publications exploring ways in which academic insights and the historic experience of stakeholder groups can be mediated to enhance their understanding of their present\-day situation. They are thereby equipped to contextualise their present situation and critically to learn from the past. The two strands of research were conducted in parallel between 2008 and 2017.  There was considerable cross\-fertilisation, with the engaged research informing archival research agendas, and insights from the archival research immediately shared with stakeholder groups. Prof Burns, the KCL Co\-I in the original **\[G2\]** project, also contributed to the archival research, notably through a case\-study of early Victorian church\-building in Bethnal Green, and participated in the engaged research led by The Open University team. 

 The principal findings from the archival research conducted by The Open University were: 

-  A case\-study of the north London suburb of Finchley **\[O2\]** highlighted the local and contingent factors that shaped patterns of growth and decline in church congregations. These included the location of the church building in relation to the population, the effectiveness of the clergy, and the nature of competing religious options. 

-  An analysis of Christian responses to the longstanding non\-Christian religious minorities in London **\[O5\]** concluded that the capital’s historic religious diversity has been a significant stimulus to the continuing relative vitality of its churches. 

-  An analysis of London since the 1960s **\[O6\]** concluded that the overall level of religious activity was quite similar at the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century to what it had been at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Its nature, however, had changed substantially, with the decline of most historic Christian churches and the advance of other world religions as well as of newer forms of Christianity, especially Pentecostalism. 

 Between 2009 and 2014 these insights were shared and developed in extensive conversations with present\-day religious groups, initially focused on the Church of England Diocese of London, and subsequently extended to Baptists, Black Majority Churches, Methodists, Roman Catholics, Jews and Muslims. Two websites were developed to provide a continuing legacy from this work. The materials present insights from the research, highlighting the importance of historical understanding for present\-day religious groups, and providing resources for further study: 

 [http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/building\-on\-history\-project/](http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/building-on-history-project/) 

 [http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/religion\-in\-london/](http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/religion-in-london/) 

 The main findings from this aspect of the research **\[O1, O3, O4, G1, G2\]** were: 

-  That it is important for religious organizations to be aware of the long\-term contexts \(e.g. location, social composition\) and recurrent patterns of behaviour \(e.g. styles of leadership, attitudes to the surrounding community\) that continue to shape their present\-day experience. 

-  That archives accessible to religious practitioners as well as to academic researchers provide an essential basis for developing such understanding and it is therefore important that religious organizations invest in the preservation of such records. 

-  That historical awareness can make an important contribution to addressing misunderstanding towards and between contemporary religious groups.  For example, it raises awareness of commonalities of experience and of past collaboration and acceptance. Moreover, hostilities such as anti\-Catholicism and Islamophobia can be better mitigated if their origins are understood. 

 The research was subsequently extended beyond London to explore the historical dimensions of contemporary religious conflicts, notably in relation to Northern Ireland, and has highlighted the importance of historical research and religious literacy in addressing such situations. A current H2020 grant **\[G3\]** is supporting work with a Europe\-wide scope, seeking to make historic archival evidence of religious toleration meaningful to present\-day young people.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has had impact on religious archives, especially two flagship and influential projects, and also had wider community and policy impact through engagement with religious groups themselves. Their participation has enhanced their understanding of the importance and value of religious archives and of what we can learn from the past. 

###  Impact on East London Mosque archives 

 In February 2013 as part of the AHRC\-funded ‘Building on History: Religion in London’ project **\[G4\]** we held an event on Muslim religious history at the East London Mosque. The programme brought together the research of The Open University team on the significance of historical insight for contemporary religious groups **\[O1, O3, O4\]** with the research of the Co\-I, Prof Humayun Ansari \(RHUL\) on the detailed history of the mosque itself. Our presentations highlighted the importance of documenting the long\-term history of Muslims in Britain as a corrective to perceptions of Islam as an alien and hostile presence. The East London Mosque Archives website **\[C2\]** describes this event as a “ *milestone*” in its development. In 2014, the Mosque launched an appeal to install a strong room, with a brochure that included a prominently placed quotation relating to our work **\[C2\]**. The appeal raised GBP50,000 and the strongroom was opened by the Mayor of London in November 2017, becoming the first professionally organized and purpose\-built facility in the UK for storing Muslim historical records **\[C2\]**. 

 This achievement has had a wider impact on Muslim communities which is corroborated by the Chair of the ELM Archives Committee, who led the Mosque’s fundraising campaign and writes that “ *Professor **Wolffe's** contributions \[…\] were important in increasing awareness within communities of the importance of preserving archives*” **\[C1\]**.  In a briefing to the CEO of the National Archives in 2016 the then Senior Advisor for Religious Archives, reported that “ *The East London Mosque is becoming a “standard\-bearer” and public exemplar for mosque and other Islamic archives in the UK*”, and went on explicitly to relate this achievement to the contribution of The Open University’s research **\[C3\]**. 

###  Impact on investment in Lambeth Palace Library \[LPL\] 

 Meanwhile, the research **\[**especially **G2\]** was a significant factor influencing the Church Commissioners’ decision in November 2016 to invest GBP23,500,000 \(over 10% of their total 2016 spend of GBP231,000,000\) in a new building for LPL, which houses historic books and archives documenting the global influence of the Church of England. Hence, in the context of western Europe, it is regarded as “ *the most important religious collection outside the Vatican*” **\[C4\]**. Previously the library had been prone to see itself as a small specialist academic library, while the Church Commissioners, for their part, had been reluctant to invest in it because they saw the preservation of archives as irrelevant to the present\-day mission of the Church. The research **\[O3, O4\]**, in which LPL was a partner and which it promotes on its website, contributed to an important shift in its self\-image. According to the Director of Libraries and Archives for the Church of England “ *some \[Church Commissioners\] board members saw heritage as quite distinct and different from mission, and the Building on History project demonstrated clearly how heritage is mission*” and that “ *archives have a great practical value to the wider church and community outside of academic spheres*”. This significant change in approach is also evident in LPL’s hope that in the future they will secure funding for research on subjects of practical interest to the present\-day church **\[C5\]**. 

 Construction of the building began in April 2018 and was completed in July 2020. It will open in 2021.  By replacing the cramped unsuitable medieval buildings in which the library was previously housed the new facilities will greatly enhance resources for the study of the Church’s history, fulfilling the vision of the research by making them much more accessible to church members and to the general public as well as to academics. The hoardings that protected the site from passers\-by in Lambeth Palace Road were used for displays that encapsulated this vision for a publicly\-engaged history of the church offering “ *a sense of continuity and a living heritage*” **\[C6\]**. 

###  Impact on professional archives community 

 The wider impact of the research on the professional archives community has been mediated particularly through the Religious Archives Group \[RAG\] which brings together representatives of specifically religious archives \(e.g. Methodist Archives, Westminster Archdiocesan Archives\) with those from other major collections with substantial holdings relating to religion \(e.g. National Archives, London Metropolitan Archives\). In an internal National Archives report in 2015 the then Senior Advisor for Religious Archives for the National Archives described the collaboration with Prof **Wolffe** and his team as “ *particularly fruitful*”.  Prof **Wolffe** spoke about the research at their conference in May 2015 and he was elected as their President in 2017. Dr **Maiden** is also a member of the committee. The former National Archives Senior Advisor for Religious Archives pays tribute to the “ *experience, knowledge and awareness*” that they have brought to the Group’s work through their research **\[C3\]**. Their insights have informed activities to evidence the relevance of religious archives for present\-day religious groups and inter\-faith understanding. They have also widened interest in the collection and deposit of archives to religious groups beyond the historic British churches, including black majority churches as well as Muslims. For example, the New Testament Church of God \[NTCG\] has established a heritage centre at its Northampton headquarters, initially opened in 2014 and further developed in subsequent years **\[C7\]**. It aims to “ *learn from our past to create a better future*”. The former NTCG National Education Director reports that the research conducted by **Wolffe** and **Maiden** provided a “ *reference point, an opportunity to look downwards at our work and root it and connect it with the work of others*” **\[C7\]**. As a further example, the research prompted Finchley Reform Synagogue in 2018 to donate their records to Barnet Archives **\[C8\]**. Most recently, in autumn 2020, Prof **Wolffe** contributed to RAG’s development of the Religious Archives Support Plan 2021 to 2025 recommending initiatives to further raise the profile of religious archives and to safeguard the future of vulnerable collections that had been highlighted by the research **\[C8\]**. 

###  Impact on religious and community leaders 

 Within the Christian churches, a particular channel for impact has been a pamphlet on the parish history audit **\[O1\]**. This was a key output from the engaged research and was co\-written by a member of the OU research team \(Dr John **Maiden**\) and one of the partner representatives on the project steering group, now Director of Ministry for the Diocese of London. They continue to promote the concept of the parish history audit to churches and he sees “ *light bulbs go on in their heads. It makes complete sense to them, making connections with the past”* **\[C9\]**. The approach has also been endorsed elsewhere in the Church of England, for example by the Diocese of Derby in their *Mission Action Plan Leader’s Guide* \(2018\) **\[C9\]**. 

 The research has had further impact by informing the use of history to promote a sense of belonging and mutual respect among diverse communities, drawing particularly on Prof **Wolffe’s** ongoing \(and subsequently published\) research on historic religious diversity in London **\[O5, O6\]**.  For example, recalling an event led by the researchers in Balham 2013 involving a variety of different religious groups in his locality, the Director of the Wandsworth Community Empowerment Network, writes that “ *it brought together many of our groups and partners to recognise and understand, and appreciate their own history in the place we all live. As we do a great deal of our work with Black and other minority communities, this is important*” **\[C8\]**. A representative of Finchley Reform Synagogue testified to the role of a similar event in Finchley, also in 2013, in facilitating bringing different faith communities together, understanding difference and breaking down phobias **\[C8\]**. There have also been significant impacts on young people through activities in schools.  For example, two workshops led by the researchers with students and teachers in 2012 at Urswick School in Hackney, helped to stimulate the development of a school museum opened in December 2015, to celebrate a sense of shared institutional history **\[C10\]**. 

 Beyond London the research has had further reach in advancing an historical dimension to discussion and promotion of religious literacy, increasingly important both in counteracting the ignorance and prejudice that can fuel community divisions and encouraging appreciation of the shared and complementary identities that can advance social cohesion. The Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire, in an unsolicited letter found the research conclusions, as summarised in the Summer 2017 edition of *Society Now,* “ *timely and helpful*” in his role in an area “ *where there have been tensions between communities in recent years*” **\[C11\]**. Professor **Wolffe** has twice \(April 2016 and January 2017\) been an invited speaker to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Religious Education. He was cited several times in its report *Improving Religious Literacy: A Contribution to the Debate* \(July 2016\), and warmly thanked by its Chair, Fiona Bruce MP for his “ *much valued”* contribution to its deliberations **\[C12\]**. His input is reflected in a number of the APPG’s recommendations, including that “ *the Home Office should make religious literacy training a mandatory part of the Prevent training given in schools, universities, prisons and other institutions*” \( **\[C12\]** Recommendation 11, p. 50\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Hutton’s research on Pagan Britain has led to significant cultural and economic impact for Stonehenge and English Heritage \(EH\). This impact was primarily delivered via his appointments as Academic Adviser for the design of the new Stonehenge Visitor Centre, and later as Trustee of EH. Hutton’s argument for an open\-ended interpretation of prehistoric religion shaped the planning and implementation of the opening exhibition of the Visitor Centre’s display gallery \(2013\), and a new solstice access strategy \(2016\-2017\). His input led to increased visitor numbers, enhanced visitor experience, improved relationships with key stakeholders, and has widened access to and participation in solstice events. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Hutton’s underpinning research is embodied in his 2013 monograph *Pagan Britain* **\[3.1\]**, which was the culmination of work conducted since 1993, followed by an intensive period of work between 2010 and 2013 **\[3.2\], \[3.3\], \[3.4\]**. The monograph brings together all the current evidence for, and interpretations of, prehistoric and early historic religious practice in Britain, from the Old Stone Age to the conversion to Christianity, synthesising hundreds of specialist studies with Hutton’s own research. It was followed by smaller studies applying this theme to specific subjects such as the Druids, ceremonial landscapes and archaeoastronomy **\[3.5\], \[3.6\]**. 

 In his monograph, Hutton consistently argues that the evidence for pre\-Christian religious belief and practice in Britain – spanning 36,000 years of data – can be interpreted in many different ways, which generally conform to the pre\-existing ideologies and emotional needs of the person making the interpretation. He suggests that this could in fact be represented as a positive feature, suited to an increasingly multicultural, multi\-ethnic and multi\-faith modern society based on individual choice. Consequently, Hutton proposes that henceforth professional archaeologists, historians and heritage managers locate, obtain and display the evidence for ancient ritual behaviour and belief, place it in the best possible chronological, technological, economic, cognitive and ethnic context, and lay out the apparent options for reading its meaning. They should then ‘step back’ and allow the public to make their own individual choices with regard to that meaning, with the understanding that these would necessarily be contingent, subjective and ultimately speculative. This, Hutton suggests, should replace the traditional approach whereby experts tend either to embrace opposed polemical views, and engage in a struggle for supremacy, or collectively adopt a particular view for a generation and then have it overturned by newcomers. An example of the former effect would be the rival personifications of prehistoric religion as either wise and learned or barbaric and bloodthirsty, and one of the latter would be the consensus in the mid\-twentieth century that Neolithic peoples worshipped a single Great Mother Goddess, abandoned in the 1970s. He asserts that both tactics are counter\-productive and intellectually dishonest, given the intractable and multivalent nature of the evidence. 

 At the same time, Hutton recognised the scale of the barriers that were obstructing acceptance of his recommended course of action. These comprised not only the professional traditions cited above, but the belief that experts must provide value for money, in the form of certainty; a continuing faith in human progress, perceived as a cumulative reduction in ignorance; a feeling that Britain \(or at least its component nations\) needs a commonly accepted view of the past to bond it together under the strains of globalisation; and the appeal of the quest romance, with a goal ultimately and decisively achieved, as a model for scholarly enquiry, especially as presented through the mass media. What was needed was a high\-profile test case for the operation of his proposed strategy; and that was soon provided, leading to the impacts described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Hutton’s research has had significant long\-term and sustained impacts on the approach to the interpretation and presentation of a specific monument, Stonehenge, and, more generally, on the practices of English Heritage \(EH\), a charity that manages over 400 historic monuments, buildings and places. These impacts emerged directly from Hutton’s research expertise: through two key advisory roles he has \(a\) shaped the strategies and practice at Stonehenge to improve engagement with visitors and key stakeholders, and \(b\) had economic impacts on Stonehenge and EH. 

###  Stonehenge: Creation of a World\-Leading Visitor Centre 

###  *Established a new approach to interpretation and presentation at Stonehenge* 

 Hutton’s impact on Stonehenge began after he presented research for *Pagan Britain* **\[3.1\]** at a conference in July 2012, the audience for which included the Chair of EH and members of its commission and executive board. He was subsequently invited by EH to accept the post of Academic Advisor for the construction of the first Visitor Centre to be built at Stonehenge as part of the Stonehenge Environmental Improvement Project, to be opened in December 2013. This role involved advising the organisation’s Stonehenge Director, its Senior Properties Historian and its Head of Interpretation at Stonehenge. Based on the arguments made in *Pagan Britain*, he advocated – and they agreed to establish – a permanent section of the Centre dedicated to ‘meaning’ and which would contain an ongoing series of exhibitions to emphasise the changing interpretations of the monument. His research directly informed the first of these exhibitions, running through early 2014, on the changing meanings of the monument, entitled ‘Set in Stone?’ 

 As noted by the then Chief Executive Officer of EH, Hutton had a ‘direct impact’ on the exhibition and its success. He was the ‘main historical advisor and provided invaluable advice on the initial exhibition … ensuring that the temporary exhibition and the permanent gallery had a consistent voice … \[this\] contribution was not simply a narrow academic one: it was one of interpretation’. He also advised on the display of human remains, especially to acknowledge the controversial nature of this activity, which allowed Stonehenge to improve its engagement with visitors and so – further to quote the CEO – ‘underpin\[ned\] one of the overriding objectives of the exhibition’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 Increased visitor numbers 

 Since the opening of the Centre in late 2013, the volume of visitors to the monument increased from 1.2 to 1.5 million; in January and February 2014 visitor numbers were up 29% on the same months for 2013 **\[5.1\]**, **\[5.6\]**. Stonehenge is the seventh\-most popular visitor attraction in the UK, at a time when tourism represents the fifth most important industry in the nation, adding GBP22 billion to the economy in 2017 **\[5.2\]**. It earns one quarter of the total income of EH, and the 18 June 2019 ITV national poll voted it Britain’s Greatest National Treasure. 

###  *Enhanced the visitor experience* 

 The award\-winning Visitor Centre \(European Heritage Award / Europa Nostra Award prize EU Prize for cultural heritage\) has been able to – to quote the Stonehenge Director – ensure that ‘visitors are more engaged with the stories around Stonehenge’ **\[5.7\]**. Hutton’s contribution to it shaped those ‘stories’, particularly through his emphasis on the importance of meaning and interpretation. 

 Feedback on the Visitor Centre has been overwhelmingly positive, including responses to the exhibition on which Hutton especially advised, with members of the public describing it as ‘very well done and informative’. The management has acknowledged the broader appeal, especially to an international audience. In terms of the improvement of Stonehenge’s engagement with visitors, it is notable that many since 2014 have specifically compared their experience with previous visits, commenting online that it is ‘vastly improved’, ‘much better’, and that ‘while the rocks haven’t changed, the entire experience has … I learned so much this time around’ **\[5.1\], \[5.4\]**. 

 Visitors also leave the attraction with a clear understanding of the open\-ended nature of historical interpretation: 'The interpretative centre and signs are very helpful but remember as we discover more our ideas must change' commented one visitor from Australia. Another visitor from the US wrote: 'I love the fact that they say clearly we cannot be certain as to the purpose or function of the stone circle... it's nice to know the story isn't completely written' **\[5.4\]**. 

###  English Heritage: Adoption of Improved Strategies and Practice Leading to Widened Access to Heritage Sites 

 Hutton’s research on Druid and Pagan groups **\[3.1\], \[3.3\], \[3.6\]** has shaped EH’s policies and strategies. In April 2015, he was appointed Trustee, as a combined representative of history and archaeology, on the new Board formed to manage the organisation as a charity. In this role he was invited to continue implementing his strategy for the interpretation of the ancient past. As the current CEO of EH notes, he is ‘the sole professional historian on the board’, where he ‘exerts authority as a leading academic’ and has also ‘made an impact on a more ad hoc basis as a counsellor and “sounding board” for various issues’ **\[5.6\]**. The Stonehenge solstice strategy was one such issue. 

 Facilitated the successful implementation of new policy and safeguarded relationships 

 Based on his research expertise, Hutton was invited by EH to advise on and approve the new strategy adopted in 2017 to reduce the number of visitors to Stonehenge during the periods of free access at the summer and winter solstices. The cost of such access had become unsustainable, and the behaviour of visitors was deteriorating, so the Stonehenge Director had decided to charge for car parking and ban alcohol. This policy proved controversial, especially to modern Druid and Pagan groups, who regarded the monument as their holy place and alcohol as sacramental. As a result of Hutton’s detailed knowledge of the beliefs of these groups, he was able to counsel the Director about how to talk to group leaders in a particular manner, and so to persuade them to understand and accept the new arrangements. This removed most tension and enabled the successful implementation of the policy. These impacts are particularly significant because the new arrangements were considered to be very risky for the organisation since they could have resulted in a public relations disaster and a permanent breakdown in their relationship with key stakeholders. 

 These strategies, as with those for the new Visitor Centre, have had benefits for Stonehenge both through improving relationships with its visitors and through a positive economic impact for EH. In consequence of the approach taken with Hutton’s advice, opposition to the new solstice arrangements virtually disappeared, while visitor behaviour improved, and access became sustainable again. 

 To quote the Stonehenge Director: ‘\[Hutton’s\] input has allowed me to change my approach towards the solstices and stakeholders of that particular event’, and **‘**Ronald has undoubtedly helped me to build more productive relationships with key stakeholders’ **\[5.7\]**. 

 One of those stakeholders, leader of the largest Druid group, likewise testifies to Hutton’s crucial mediatory role in producing ‘an atmosphere of renewed understanding and amity, which was unlikely to have been possible … without his advice to both parties and his readiness to bring together’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 Widened access and participation in solstice celebrations 

 EH’s new policy on solstices aimed to create a more peaceful and enjoyable experience and to open the events up to a new demographic, including children and families. In June 2019, the Summer solstice was observed by up to 10,000 people, an increase on previous years, with many of these visitors coming for the first time **\[5.3, 5.7\]**. 

 Overall, Hutton’s research has demonstrably acted to make the management of Britain’s greatest ancient monument both more profitable and less controversial. This has taken place within a wider effect of his research: allowing a greater diversity of interpretation of, and relationship with, the monument, which is suitable for a more diverse society. The policies adopted at Stonehenge will be used as a model of best practice and help to shape EH’s approach to its other ancient ceremonial monuments.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 **Professor Graeme Gooday’s** research on the class\- and gender\-dependency of early UK domestic electrification, latterly with **Professor Abigail** **Harrison Moore**, furnished new stories used by national and local groups: 

 i\)  For adult and school\-age visitors, leading UK country houses – Cragside, Harewood House, Lotherton Hall and Standen – redeveloped their digital and onsite collections\-based engagement to integrate stories of electrification into their social history. 

 ii\) Leading UK technology organizations, the Women’s Engineering Society, the Institution of Engineering & Technology, as well as the Science Museum Group, transformed their narratives of women’s long involvement in engineering to help normalize expectations of female future participation in this profession. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The original research was undertaken by **Professor Graeme** **Gooday** in the Leverhulme\- and AHRB\-funded *Science in the Nineteenth Century Periodical* \(1999\-2002\) project and the AHRC\-funded Research Leave project *Electrifying History* \(2006, **I**\) with the main research product his 2008 monograph: *Domesticating Electricity: Technology, Uncertainty & Gender, 1880\-1914* \( **1**\). 

 **Gooday’s** initial research \(2000\-2007\), examined how responses to the innovation of electric lighting were documented in periodical literature across late nineteenth century Britain. He found extensive writing about electricity installations by both aristocratic men and engineering spouses \(hitherto unacknowledged by historians or engineers\), which addressed widespread doubts about the aesthetics, safety record, economy and reliability of electrical supply. From this evidence **Gooday** challenged both consumerist assumptions that domestic electricity was widely demanded as soon as it became available, and the technocratic assumption that electricity’s adoption was inevitable simply on the grounds of its efficiency. 

 He thus took on a broader investigation of the key factors in how far electrification actually occurred, and why it was sometimes rejected. By studying periodicals, newspapers and personal archives, two key factors emerged that hitherto had escaped historians’ attention: 

1.  The role of the wealthy aristocracy in country houses with both the resources and inclination to experiment with this expensive and hazardous new means of illumination in the early 1880s, and then \(not necessarily successfully\) to glamorise the electric light to broader audiences as the preferred illuminant \(vs coal gas or candles\) of social elites. Two such country houses explored were Cragside in Northumbria and Hatfield House in Hertfordshire. 

1.  the significant role of electrical engineers’ spouses in promoting the merits of electrification to home\-makers.  In part, decisions to electrify the home were taken by women whose concerns about electricity’s aesthetic and safety problems were most effectively met by writings from the authoritative women who had collaborated with engineering spouses in electric lighting projects. One particularly important figure was Alice Brandreth Gordon, who wrote the best\-selling *Decorative* *Electricity* \(1890/91\) as “Mrs J. E. H. Gordon,” spouse of consulting engineer James Edward Henry Gordon. 

 Building upon *Domesticating Electricity*, **Gooday** collaborated with historian of art & design, **Professor Abigail** **Harrison Moore** in 2011\-16 to further understanding of electrification’s material culture \( **2, 3**\). With **Harrison Moore**, **Gooday** secured AHRC follow\-on funding in 2015\-16 for *Electrifying the Country House* \(ECH; **II**\), with **Dr Michael Kay** as PDRA \( **4**\). The final phase of impact relates to **Gooday’s** research since 2016 with **Dr Elizabeth** **Bruton** \(formerly employed at Leeds, now Curator of Engineering, Science Museum, London\) \( **5**\). Launched to support the centenary of the Women’s Engineering Society \(WES\) in 2019, the recent AHRC follow\-on project *Electrifying Women* \(EW; **III**\) publicized how women’s expert technical roles pre\-dated WES’s foundation, with **Dr Emily** **Rees** as Research and Engagement Assistant \( **6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact I:** **Inspiring country houses, enabling volunteers, and engaging publics with stories of technological innovation** 

 In the ECH project **Gooday, Harrison Moore** and **Kay** collaborated with National Trust properties Cragside and Standen, and Leeds City Council’s Lotherton Hall to embed their stories as pioneers in electricity supply with new site\-specific visitor resources and a collaborative digital interactive tailored for the UK primary curriculum Key Stage 2 \(KS2\). 

 New visitor trails and digital resources enabled the properties to integrate their innovative stories of electrical science into more familiar cultural and social narratives. Standen can now communicate its status as one of the first British houses to be built with electrical fittings to its 151,401 visitors in 2018\-19 \(417 per day\): *“For too long this important aspect of the property‘s history had been underplayed and as a result of this project we will be able to share it with people and give it the status it deserves”* \( **A**\). For Cragside’s c.250,000 visitors p.a. \(2018\-19 figure\), ECH’s digital resources *“enhanced several segments of visitors from the ‘curious minds’ who crave some information through to ‘out and abouts’ who like just a brief overview – making their visits more enjoyable; \[…\]* *the portability made it a tool for a core visit and visiting parties, making it accessible to a larger audience”* \( **B**\). **Kay’s** funding \( **IV**\) enabled Harewood House to become the fourth heritage partner: archival research on its electrification fed into a temporary exhibit on the State Floor \(Summer 2017\) and a permanent exhibit, *The* *Below Stairs Lighting Cabinet.* Both of these integrated narratives from *Domesticating Electricity* \( **1**\) and linked to ‘Below Stairs’ activities, drawing visitors’ attention to servants’ use of electricity in life and work. Harewood recorded 210,694 annual visitors \(Association of Leading Visitor Attractions 2019\). 

 The project team trained Cragside volunteers to give them the confidence and ability to deliver ECH’s new technological stories to visitors. Three educational animations, produced by ECH interns, and other bespoke online resources were made freely available and loaded on tablets *in situ* to enable the c.80 volunteers to react to visitor enquiries and *“give a visual representation of the systems involved in the magic that is hydroelectricity at Cragside”.* It also furnished all volunteers with *a “simple visual* aide memoire *to immediately display to visitors”* and the most experienced volunteers *“the opportunity to delve deeper in the story through the very same medium”* \( **B**\). At Lotherton Hall, where **Kay** co\-produced an educational visitor trail and the film, *Lotherton Electrified* \(2016\) for its c.480,000 visitors \(April 2018 – April 2019\), ECH *“enhanced \[volunteers’\] delivery and interest in the subject,”* encouraged them to undertake their own research, and boosted *“their confidence”* in discussing technical topics \( **A**\). Standen’s 40 volunteers responded enthusiastically to **Kay** and **Harrison Moore’s** lecture to staff, which introduced the house’s story of innovation. Volunteers noted that it enabled them to give more complete accounts of early electricity, helping room guides to give more detailed answers to visitors’ questions \( **A**\). Indeed, *“To many it \[the research\] was revelatory and developed a consistent story to tell, through the many staff and volunteers involved, across the property”* \( **B**\). 

 ECH facilitated an unprecedented collaboration among the three original country houses, to enhance their traditional heritage roles and integrate those into online resources to support the national curriculum’s science element. For example, the ECH interactive, *Exploring the First Electrical Houses,* tells the stories of Cragside, Lotherton Hall and Standen, blending local stories with themes of aesthetics and reliability in stories of electrification drawn directly from **Gooday’s** *Domesticating Electricity* \( **1**\). Tested by pupils from two West Yorkshire\-based schools, this interactive has contributed to primary teaching in science, history, art, and design & technology areas of the KS2 curriculum. The interactive resource proved effective for children’s learning: one teacher noted that pupils “ *really* *loved”* the character card exercise \( **A**\). Cragside’s House Manager observed how the interactive enhanced interpretation both *“on the property and online”*, providing thereby *“valuable material prior to school visits and on the visits too”* \( **B**\). 

 The project reached a broad, diversely\-situated set of audiences through a range of avenues and public events, including Light Night 2015 \(110 attendees, 90% of whom rated it a ‘quite good’ or ‘very good’ event\), six public lectures, media coverage \(including *BBC Radio Leeds, Modern History Review* \(April 2018\) and *The Conversation* \(22.07.2019; 3,073 views at 31.12.2020\)\) and participation in public heritage events, such as Old Science Week \(2015\) at Lotherton Hall and Heritage Open Days at the University of Leeds \( **A, C**\). **Gooday** and **Kay** also supported 24 University of Leeds drama students in a musical theatrical adaptation *Electrified* \(2015\) of related stories from Hatfield House featured in *Domesticating Electricity* \( **1**\). This material was re\-worked as Harewood\-focused workshops in summer 2016 for c.30 students attending *IntoUniversity,* which provides holiday learning centres across the UK to inspire achievement in young people from socio\-economically deprived areas. 

 Since ECH finished, Standen’s curatorial team has exploited collaborations further, bringing **Gooday** and **Harrison Moore’s** research to new audiences in the House, on television and online. In BBC4’s *Victorian Sensations: Electric Dreams* \(22.05.2019; c.500,000 viewers\), **Harrison Moore** drew attention to Philip Webb’s bespoke sunflower lamp \(an object highlighted in the KS2 interactive\) while popular science presenter Hannah Fry’s voiceover emphasises the crucial role played by women in the eventual acceptance of electricity in affluent homes: *“planning the interior with Webb is family matriarch, Margaret Beale. It’s women like her that are driving the take\-up of electric power”* \(5.50\-9.40mins, **C**\). **Harrison Moore** also discusses the significance of Standen’s electrical innovations for the arts and crafts movement in the short film *William Morris: Useful Beauty in the Home* \(2018, the second most\-watched HENI Talk \(a non\-commercial initiative to provide accessible art history films for 14\-16 year olds created as a result of declining access to Art History in schools\) with 210k\+ views at 08.12.2020, **C**\). Embedded in Standen’s website, an edited version of the film also runs permanently in the House as part of the National Trust’s interpretation for its c.151,000 visitors p.a., and has been used as a teaching resource by schools in the pandemic period: ‘ *Great quality in small compass’* \(home\-schooling parent, UK, 03.06.2020, **C**\). 

 ECH research \( **3, 4**\) provided the central thrust to Standen’s 2020 exhibition, *A Dangerous Novelty? The Age of Electricity* \(18.01\-31.03.2020\), with **Gooday** and **Harrison Moore** advising on descriptive panels and object selection. Visitors to Standen remarked that they had not previously considered its relation to the history of domestic electricity: *“the exhibition has made me reflect on how much electricity matters to* us *”*; *“\[I\]* *hadn’t realised the importance of Standen House in the introduction of electricity to our lives”;* and, *“the exhibition has reminded me that new things are frightening and we have to help people move forward \[in relation to sustainable technologies\]”* \( **C**\). These are all headlines from **Gooday** and **Harrison Moore**’s research \( **2**\); and, like *Electric Dreams*, the exhibition also included original *Punch* cartoons which had been deployed to reflect the public reception of electricity in **Gooday’s** *Domesticating Electricity* \( **1**\) *.* As Standen’s House Manager emphasised, the ECH research *“has provided us with a new way of interpreting the House and engaging a diversity of audiences and their interests”* \( **C**\). 

 **Impact II:** **Changing perceptions about the long history of women in** **engineering ** 

 In the *Electrifying Women* \(EW\) project **Gooday, Bruton** and **Rees** \(the **EW team**\) collaborated with the Women’s Engineering Society \(WES\), Science Museum Group \(SMG\) and Institution of Engineering & Technology \(IET\) to promote wider cross\-sector knowledge of WES’s centenary in 2019\-20.  This was a key opportunity to enhance public awareness of women’s long under\-recognised participation in engineering, as documented in *Domesticating Electricity* \( **1**\). 

 EW engaged new audiences with locally\-specific histories of women’s engineering roles since the nineteenth century, showing the many precedents for women’s work in the field. The programme delivered 32 integrated events across England, Scotland and Wales, comprising free public lectures, Wikithons, student workshops, archive taster events, creative writing workshops, volunteer training sessions and a student\-led musical theatre production, *SHE*. The project introduced 1,647 members of the public to established female engineering figures, such as Hertha Ayrton, and to those newly re\-surfaced, like Henrietta Vansittart. Online audiences comprising 30,000\+ people from 60\+ countries were reached through blogposts, short films, online events \(including presentations at the first *British Society for the History of Science Global Digital Festival* \(6\-10.07.2020; 53 attendees from 8 countries\)\), free resources, Facebook and Twitter accounts and newspaper articles \( *Yorkshire Evening Post* \(15.07.2019\); *The Guardian/The Observer* \(16.06.2020; 24,471 views at 22.09.2020\)\) \( **C**, **D**\). 

 By engaging HE and non\-STEM groups, the project helped WES engage with *“audiences that would not otherwise have been reached”*, bringing *“about a significant step\-change in how the WES centenary was celebrated and shared”* \( **E**\) *.* The **EW team** took *“archival stories of WES’s founding to engineering undergraduates at Nottingham and Loughborough,”* who *“will now be more able to contribute to the writing of WES’s history”* \( **F**\). *SHE* \(21\-23.11.2019\) introduced c.800 audience members to histories of women in engineering, with 92% finding the production *Extremely relevant and educational* \( *SHE* Survey, n=43\). Students from the production later collaborated with WES to create three dramatic videos for its YouTube Channel \( **C**\). Creative writing workshops attracted 30 participants and led to two co\-produced anthologies, which drew upon themes and characters from **Gooday’s** *Domesticating Electricity* \( **1**\): *Electrifying Women: From Fact to Fantasy* \(Hannah Stone ed.; UoL: Feb. 2020\) and *Even More Electrifying Women: The Can’t Lockdown Creativity Edition* \(Stone ed.,UoL: Oct. 2020\), including contributions from Spain and Germany. These events *“offered an innovative way of taking the story of women engineers”* to new regional, national and international publics \( **E**\). The **EW** **team** also provided research training to self\-selecting participants, building capacity for on\-going discovery and public documentation of early female engineers. For example, over three Wikithons, **EW team** trained 46 new Wikipedia editors, improved 101 articles and created 21 new pages \( **D**\). The Pageviews Analysis tool shows they have since been read 315,500 times \( **G**\). Although Wikipedia is the 13th\-most visited website in the world, only 18% of its pages are dedicated to women: Wikimedia UK confirmed that the EW project had helped fulfil its *“strategic goal* *to increase the engagement and representation of marginalised people and subjects”* and applauded the **EW team** *“for identifying a need and taking positive steps to address it”* \( **G**\). 

 A thirst for information about women’s past work in engineering was apparent at all EW events. At the Leeds launch, attendees highlighted the pressing need to enhance the historical visibility of female engineers: “ *you can’t be what you can’t see, right?”* and “ *Visibility helps\! Dismantle idea that women haven’t got the right skills”* \( **D**\). At later events, attendees commented: “ *Information I've never come across before”; “Surprised at extent and earliness of participation”; “It’s made me realise how long a hidden history of women there is in engineering, and made me more aware of the ways in which they became hidden, and how their stories might be uncovered”* \( **D**\). WES’s CEO confirmed that *“through EW’s work, national awareness of WES’ existence and origins has been significantly boosted”* \( **E**\). Workshop feedback from female engineering students confirmed that learning about antecedents helped contextualise their experience; one said that *“it was very motivating and inspirational. Helps me want to continue to pursue my engineering degree”* \( **D**\). 

 The **EW team** forged an *“invaluable expert* *network”* \( **H**\) of curators, archivists and researchers, who worked together to expose more stories of women in engineering in heritage collections. For the IET, EW has *“opened new opportunities for research into the history of women in engineering that goes beyond the WES collections”* by examining stories of non\-professional women engineers. The IET Library and Archives Manager testified that the EW project *“has increased the public profile of our collections on women in engineering*, *”* with staff *“now know\[ing\] more about the individuals in our collections”* \( **F**\). 

 The project’s events and online resources have contributed to SMG delivering its *Inspiring Futures Vision 2030* and *“helped the Science Museum to build a society literate in engineering,”* *“grow engineering capital”* and *“show\[n\] that engineering is open to all”* \( **I**\). A key facet of this was the Science Museum’s launch of a dedicated *Women in* *Engineering* webpage in June 2020, bringing EW case studies, such as Henrietta Vansittart and Katherine Parsons, to the global online readership of a flagship heritage organisation \(5,204 views at 22.12.2020, **I**\). Parsons’ inclusion as a spousal collaborator epitomizes **Gooday**’s focus on familial co\-working as a core feature of women’s early participation in engineering. The **EW team** also brokered the collaboration between WES and the Science and Industry Museum, Manchester \(SIM\) informing the £6 million, Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport\-funded redevelopment of its oldest and one of its most popular galleries, the Power Hall, due to reopen in 2021. Again delivering on SMG’s *Inspiring Futures Vision 2030* and seeking to *“inspir\[e\] reflection on women in engineering careers today*, *”* the Power Hall reinterpretation draws upon EW to help include *“diverse examples of people who have worked closely with engines”*. SIM Curator of Engineering emphasised the challenge the museum faced in finding women who worked locally as engineers and how its collaboration with the EW project led to the identification of *“specific figures*, *”* including Dorothy Smith, apprenticed with Metropolitan Vickers in 1916 and who spent her career developing electric motors \( **H**\). Smith features in the redesigned Power Hall. As WES’ CEO observed: *“This conjoint participation will ensure, for the first time, that stories of women engineers \(including WES members\) will feature in all areas of that large\-scale exhibition”* \( **E**\). 

 A successful international session at the BSHS Global Digital Festival in July 2020 enabled the **EW team** to introduce UK partners to a recently\-formed alliance based in North America: the Society of Women Engineers \(USA\), the Canadian Institute of Women Engineers & Scientists, and the International Network of Women Engineers and Scientists \(INWES\). An EW\-hosted video meeting on 10 December 2020 facilitated a collaborative plan to deliver more inclusive transnational stories. By brokering these connections EW has thus facilitated an important initiative in enabling a properly global understanding of women’s long history in engineering, which *“will enable a significant step\-change in the nature of INWES’s activity”* \( **J**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 When assessing the impact of proposed new developments, urban planners need to pay special consideration to preserving or enhancing the characteristics of sensitive cityscapes, a complex exercise that traditionally has relied on static visualisations. Research into virtual city modelling at Northumbria has developed novel digital solutions, which have been applied to conurbations in the North East of England: Virtual NewcastleGateshead \(VNG\) and Virtual Sunderland \(VS\). These innovative tools have provided city planners with the ability to conduct comprehensive assessments of the visual impacts of a development against current and future cityscapes. The insights provided efficiencies that have saved time, money, and created a more effective process for assessing and marketing key planning applications. Since 2013, the research has improved the assessment of 20 major developments throughout North East England, valued in total at over GBP1,300,000,000. The virtual tools now feature as embedded elements within local authority planning policies across the North East, informing key strategic plans, including a central government\-backed Foresight Programme that will also shape long\-term national strategy regarding future development.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 3D cityscapes or virtual city models \(VCMs\) are increasingly used to manage urban development, with the integration of diverse types of data helping to improve usability and assessment. One key area of application is with the planning process, which plays an important role in protecting, preserving, or enhancing the unique characteristics and appearance of visually sensitive cityscapes. However, this extremely complicated exercise is often constrained by limited resources for accurate assessment and limited opportunities for applicants to show a variety of viewpoints. The resulting representations may be biased and partial, ultimately leading to a potential for lasting damage to visually sensitive cityscapes. To address these issues, the Digital Built Environment research group \(DBE\) at Northumbria University developed innovative, real\-time, and flexible visualisation techniques, which integrate VCMs with useful urban datasets, including identifying buildings of historic relevance \[ **R1**\- **R5**\]. These techniques provide a more impartial, accurate, and comprehensive assessment of the visual impact of a development against current and future cityscapes. 

 The DBE groups’ exploration of virtual reality \(VR\) adoption and 3D modelling within the architectural, engineering, and construction industries, established the potential benefits for VR adoption and the barriers preventing it \(specifically the time required to create 3D models\) \[ **R1**\]. This work identified the VCM as a solution to help overcome the outlined challenges, by delivering an effective VR experience. Research into the use of smaller scale VCM to support VR experiences of individual sites, paved the way for the application of a larger scale model covering an entire city, to support urban planning assessment \[ **R1**\]. 

 Further research defined the ideal requirements of a virtual city model for city authorities \(urban planning and design\), citizens \(public participation\), and practitioners \(architects and developers\). These studies critically examined available technologies, remote access issues, collaboration, and version control \[ **R2**\]. The work led to the original iteration of the virtual city model of Newcastle and Gateshead, Virtual NewcastleGateshead \(VNG\). 

 A challenge for many early VCMs is that they were often created for a single application and would therefore quickly become obsolete; for VCMs to be useful they need to remain relevant and up to date. The DBE group subsequently identified obsolescence factors for VCMs, including the need for continual updating through strategic collaborations between multiple organisations, to maintain the currency of VCMs over time \[ **R3**\]. As a solution, the research highlighted the need for a more multifunctional approach to improve the sustainability of VCMs, aligning the development of ‘real’ cityscapes to assess urban planning proposals visually and analytically. This considered ‘layering’ models with data for visualised simulations of the performance of urban spaces – including movement, noise, wind, and thermal comfort – and consequent issues of data as well as software interoperability \[ **R3**\]. 

 The DBE group, now led by Dr James Charlton, continued to work with councils in Newcastle, Gateshead, and later Sunderland, to develop pioneering digital tools to help protect the historic low\-rise architecture and the city image and cityscape associated with these urban areas \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. The research was funded by all three councils \(Newcastle, Gateshead, and Sunderland\), and developed novel methodologies for the optimisation, application, and integration of VCM with urban datasets to support the largest city developments. The research improved interoperability and management of VCM, particularly those with challenging, city\-scale assessment criteria, by establishing the appropriate level of detail and file formats to support effective storage, management, and application \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. This work demonstrated how adding data layers to an VCM can improve functionality, allowing planners to consider the relationship between historic buildings and newly proposed ones. The VNG for example, can single out architectural features and identify listed buildings, and improved visual outputs enable recognition of diverse features, enabling bespoke and tailored solutions. Although the increased detail can lead to challenges as a result of high volumes of data, the VNG provides a balance between operability and detail, enabling planning assessment that is sufficiently flexible to allow interoperability with other systems such as those used by architects \[ **R4**, **R5**\]. 

 Since 2012, research by Charlton and his colleagues has enhanced the VNG, making it more relevant and applicable with each iteration. Major revisions to the model have been released every four years since 2009, with the next update confirmed for 2021. Incremental updates to the urban form are also added continually as new proposals go through the planning system \[ **R3**\- **R5**\]. This feature has enabled planners to both carry out assessment in an up\-to\-date model, but also model future developments based on buildings in progress, as well as those already completed. The resulting digital solutions, VNG and VS, are now at the forefront of the visual assessment of proposed major developments across the North East of England.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 New visualisation techniques developed by researchers from Northumbria – Virtual NewcastleGateshead \(VNG\) and Virtual Sunderland \(VS\) – have provided local authorities and architectural practitioners throughout the North East of England with a more accurate understanding of the visual impact that proposed developments will have on sensitive cityscapes. These tools now feature as embedded elements within new planning policies for Gateshead Council \(GC\), as well as Newcastle \(NCC\) and Sunderland \(SCC\) City Councils. They have informed strategic development plans undertaken by each Council, and provided a more effective process for pitching, assessing, and marketing key development proposals. 

 **4.1 Improving the effectiveness of assessment processes for major planning proposals and heritage preservation** 

 Since 2014, the novel visualisation techniques and virtual tools developed through collaboration with Northumbria have been used in the assessment of 20 major developments \[ **E1**\], totalling over GBP1,300,000,000 worth of investment, primarily in Newcastle \[ **E2a**\]. In this period, the model was used by NCC and GC to inform the approval process for a series of major proposals, including the West Quay in Newcastle \(GBP250,000,000\) and the Gateshead Quayside Arena \(GBP260,000,000\) \[ **E1**, **E2a**\]. It has also informed the proposed development of Europe’s biggest Ferris wheel, dubbed the ‘Whey Aye’ \(140m high/112m diameter, to be located on the former Spillers Quay in Newcastle\) \[ **E3**\]. NCC’s July 2019 planning committee report highlighted the integral role the VNG has played in the decision\-making process, allowing them to understand the impact across the cityscape \[ **E4**, p32, p35\]. 

 In Sunderland, Northumbria research has been incorporated into the Riverside Sunderland Supplementary Planning Report, published in June 2020 \[ **E5**; **E6a**, p76\]. The VS tool was singled out as a best\-practice model for the assessment of planning proposals on this major re\-development scheme. The project will double the resident population of the city centre to over 5,000, increase employment by 50% to 18,000, and attract significant investment, such as financial services giant Legal & General, which announced in 2019 that it would invest GBP100,000,000 into site \[ **E6b**\]. As the planning report itself noted, the VS tool *‘provides clients with 3D city data of their site and surrounding context to support their own internal assessment and design development, and access to the larger virtual city model via physical or virtual workshops to support the assessment of the proposal and the generation and capture of desired views’* \[ **E6a**, p76\]. 

 The influence of these new digital tools has followed operational advantages. Richard Charge, Urban Designer, NCC, noted *‘VNG provides valuable and tailored assessments that are not possible through traditional processes. Option testing and enhanced data layering at a citywide level are some of the most useful features and the biggest shift from traditional methods. This is particularly useful when looking at strategic views of the city and understanding the likely impact on the surrounding built environment’* \[ **E2a**\]. This resulted in NCC issuing a protocol for the use of VNG in the planning process \[ **E2b**\]. 

 For Gateshead Council, Ian Burchell, Urban Design Officer, stated that since 2014, research by Charlton and the team from Northumbria provided *‘entirely new visualisation techniques* \[which have\] *… allowed the council to test out various design scenarios to help inform design guidance and policy making’* \[ **E7**\]. The planning process has become *‘more efficient by simplifying previously time\-consuming aspects’* \[ **E7**\] *.* The results are *‘more cost effective, time efficient and accurate* \[assessment procedures\]’ \[ **E7**\]. 

 Similar benefits have been noted by SCC, with the Regeneration Manager for the council confirming how the VS tool, now plays a *‘pivotal role … and has informed the way in which development and regeneration proposals work within the wider geography of the city’* \[ **E5**\]. It has provided the council with the capacity to *‘visualise and assess our masterplans and regeneration proposals in a way that has previously not been possible’* \[ **E5**\]. The council has confirmed how the research *‘has changed both the way we work and the way we market the city* … \[the VS tool\] *is not only a powerful assessment tool guiding current and future development of sites, but also a powerful marketing tool used to demonstrate to inward investors the development opportunities that exist in the city’* \[ **E5**\]. 

  

 VNG has also played an important role in heritage preservation \[ **E3**\]. As noted by Simon Parkin, NCC’s Historic Environment Officer: *‘VNG has allowed for a far more comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of a proposed development on the settings of, and views to and from, heritage assets.’* He noted the complexity of assessing settings, and the risk this carries for the historic environment \[ **E3**\]. Stakeholder engagement is also made easier with the tool, and Parkin has observed how the research has ultimately facilitated *‘a more open discussion* \[with\] *… key external stakeholders, such as Historic England’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 **4.2 Informing strategic planning for urban development and investment** 

 As well as improving efficiency of the fundamental assessment process, Northumbria’s research has also played a central role in shaping long\-term strategic planning through development of supplementary planning documentation. The research helped to shape the development of NCCs Landmarks and Gateways Strategy: *‘this planning guidance is a long\-term strategic priority for the region that will play a significant role in shaping the development of the city\-space and environment’* \[ **E2a**\]. This strategy *‘relied upon the enhanced planning and visualisation tools provided by Northumbria research. The finalisation and agreement of this strategy would not be possible without the insights offered by the VNG digital tool’* \[ **E2a**\]. The conservation team at NCC have confirmed how the research insights have also contributed to the development of a new Tall Buildings Strategy which *‘has relied upon the enhanced planning and visualisation tools provided by Northumbria research*’ \[ **E3**\]. 

 The council has also outlined how, as a result of Charlton’s contribution to its Envisioning Futures report \[ **E8**\], the VNG is now *‘directly shaping a key element of a broader national strategy for urban planning*’ \[ **E2a**\]. The Newcastle City Futures 2065 project, funded by the Foresight Programme of the Government Office for Science under the direction of the Chief Scientific Adviser to HM Government, adopted Newcastle upon Tyne as a pilot area. Foresight projects are funded by government to give evidence to policymakers to help them create policies that are more resilient to the future. This was the first time that a Foresight project was commissioned for a regional project rather than commencing with a national project first. The VNG tool has become a central component of this pilot scheme, in turn shaping a national strategy that will determine *‘city\-wide participatory processes in urban design across the UK for the next 50 years*’ \[ **E2a**\]. 

 **4.3 Providing a more accessible planning process to support external stakeholders** 

 The ongoing developments to the tools developed by Northumbria have made planning processes more accessible and transparent for the external stakeholders involved, including planning practitioners, heritage organisations, and community groups \[ **E2a**\]. NCC reported how the research *‘has been especially important by enabling constructive engagement with stakeholders at a much earlier stage during pre\-application … creating a new opportunity for interventions earlier in the design process’* \[ **E2a**\]. In particular, the research has helped practitioners, including planning officers, planning consultants, architects, and developers to improve their engagement with local authority planning departments by getting a more comprehensive understanding of their proposal earlier on in the process \[ **E2a**\]. Findings from a survey carried out by NCC provided an indication of the range of positive response from those who have engaged with VNG through the planning process, with 94% finding it useful, 57% reporting time savings, and 27% noting that it provided cost reductions \[ **E2a**, p3\-5\]. 

 Ronnie Graham is Director of Ryder Architecture, an award\-winning international design practice with 180 staff located in offices around the world. He has reiterated the benefits that organisations such as his own have seen from engaging with Northumbria’s work, reporting that the use of the VNG has changed the way they undertake pre\-assessment of proposals. He stated that *‘VNG allows us to work much closer with the council to identify views that specifically need detailed and further assessment, providing a much more informed and efficient process and allowing to have more valuable discussions at an earlier stage, to understand the likelihood of getting planning permission’* \[ **E9**\]. Graham noted how this provides efficiencies that saved both time and money and ultimately has *‘undoubtedly resulted in better urban design’* \[ **E9**\]. 

 The underpinning research has resulted in a transformative approach to urban planning, enhanced by experiences that are both information\-rich and interactive. This body of work has improved the transparency, accuracy, speed, and volume of the city\-scale assessments and ultimately helped to protect the development, urban quality, and resilience of these sensitive cityscapes.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This research is the first to examine HR practices comprehensively at a national level in Brunei, an archetypical micro petrostate, in South\-East Asia. It demonstrates impact through organisational practice change and performance improvement within leading national organisations: exemplar being the Brunei Hotel. The national outcomes provide performance\-driven solutions, adding cross\-sector value. International impact is demonstrated in other emerging markets – specifically Jordan. Here public sector transferability is displayed. Dissemination occurred via ten high\-impact journal articles, practitioner conference presentations, workshops and collaborative initiatives with government ministries in the Middle East – demonstrating reach and influence on non\-academic audiences. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The project explores the impact of individual and collective HR practices on employee turnover rate and organisational performance across all Brunei industries, creating comparative lessons \(e.g., Darwish et al. 2017; Singh et al. 2017\). It also establishes insight on the relationship between institutional context and the performance outcomes of HR practices in other emerging markets \(e.g., Darwish et al. 2016\). Impact comes from a clearer and more detailed understanding of the influence of HR practices on organisational performance in varied industries within an emerging market. This gives managers in these contexts both the insight and applied tools and approaches to improve organisational performance. 

 This research principally evaluates the utility of more sophisticated HR practices in emerging market settings, where institutional factors may be less developed, or more fluid, and there are fewer incentives to encourage firms to use such practices. Hence, the research helps determine HR practice effectiveness within emerging markets and analyses how successful these practices are in meeting national and global challenges. The HR practices include recruitment and selection, training, retention, performance appraisals, incentives and rewards, and internal career opportunities. The project resulted in two world\-leading, five internationally excellent and three internationally recognised journal papers, a book, and other nine papers presented in world\-leading international conferences, including winning a best paper award in Singapore. 

 This project initially focused on conducting a comparative analysis of HR practices between domestic and multinational enterprises in Brunei. Results indicate that domestic firms’ HR practices still lag behind multinational organisations’ more developed approaches \(Singh et al. 2019; Mohamed et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2013\). Consequently, attention turned to domestic firms’ HR practices and their potential impacts on organisational performance. 

 Surprisingly, we found that using integrated HR models was not better than implementing individual HR interventions. One reason for this is that the primary focus of institution building in petrostates is often to service the needs of the oil\-and\-gas industry. The use of individual HR practices may therefore reflect that the industry’s needs can be more simply resolved through turning to overseas labour markets – both for skilled and unskilled labour. Simultaneously, we found that the efficacy of HR practices varied according to firm characteristics. So, even in challenging contexts, firms devise solutions that respond to their capabilities and endowments \(Darwish et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017\). 

 Additionally, results showed that firms in the oil\-and\-gas sector perform better than those in other sectors. However, the negative effects associated with operating outside of oil\-and\-gas could be mitigated through strategic choices. For instance, in such organisations the involvement of HR directors in company affairs reduced employee turnover and added positively to financial returns across sectors. This indicates that developing and enhancing the role of people management is still very much easier than bringing about structural institutional reforms. Results also confirm that at least part of the solution to contextual difficulties lies within organisations, and that strategic choices can ameliorate the firm\-level consequences of the resource curse \(Darwish et al., 2017\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This research achieved significant impact and reach during the assessment period. This is apparent in the extensive range of organisational practices and outcomes influenced at both the national and international level, as detailed below. 

###  1. National Impact \(Brunei\) 

 The findings triggered HRM changes in leading national businesses and have been cited in reports on the status of Brunei’s growth and development \[3\]. The research highlights the importance of viewing HR development and its nature in Brunei from a historic perspective, as both specific colonial legacies and resource booms have created opportunities and challenges. Although natural resource revenues have provided growth, and supported national independence, they have also led to domestic economy imbalances, skills and capital flowing to the oil and gas sector, and volatility. As the world enters energy transition, these contradictions will be heightened. Therefore, as with many petrostates, the challenge is to promote other economic areas and provide indigenous labour with skills and opportunities. This research has therefore triggered national debate to address questions including: how to find the right balance between local and international staff talent? What difficulties are faced when finding skilled local staff? What are the professional skills that local staff may currently lack and how to develop these? And what is the overall evaluation of local educational institutions in preparing future human resources \[3\].

The Brunei Hotel**: Given the research findings that firm\-level HR interventions make a difference in mitigating challenges outside the oil\-and\-gas sector \(Darwish et al., 2017\), the Hotel now considers HR director input as an integral part of its Board meetings and these have led to strategic HR integration and alignment \[1\]. 

 Major changes have been made to HR practices and policies as follows: 

 a. Hotel recruitment and selection criteria now use a new mixture of *qualifications and personal characteristics*. More specifically, the hotel now uses *qualifications* such as: educational and professional credentials, a wider range of work experience, prior experience in similar jobs and a personal presentation when recruiting and selecting potential candidates – alongside *personal characteristics* \(e.g. independent judgement, potential to grow with the job, self\-motivation, total devotion to task, and commitment to the hotel\) \[1\]. 

 b. Promotion\-from\-within is now prioritised when seeking to fill positions, particularly for senior roles. The hotel has made this change as a direct result of our research findings \(Singh et al., 2017\), which demonstrate that robust recruitment and selection processes, training and internal career opportunities contribute to positive financial performance. This practice and the changes to the use of recruitment and selection criteria outlined above, have reduced employee turnover. The hotel now believes that external appointments are not the only desirable outcome \(particularly for senior positions\). Welcoming internal candidate applications has created career progression routes to senior positions, helping ensure talent is actively grown. This is particularly important as it helps ensure that organisational knowledge and capabilities manifest in current staff are more effectively nurtured and utilised to underpin organisational performance by preparing staff to be ready to respond to opportunities for promotion and development \[1\]. 

###  3. International Impact \(Jordan\) 

 Based on HRM and performance research findings \(for more details, see Darwish et al. 2016\), a series of practical workshops \(in addition to one\-to\-one meetings\), organised with the Ministry of Social Development in Jordan, were delivered for its key staff. These focused on high\-performance practices within their workplaces and links between HR practices, strategy and performance. This generated practice changes: 

 a. HR department \(represented by its manager\) now provides regular reports to the Ministerial Committee and attends meetings to provide HR inputs. This has been critical in developing better alignment between HR strategy and the Ministry’s overall strategic direction \[2\]. 

 b. Additionally, given the significant role of training evidenced \(Darwish et. 2016\), the Ministry has engaged the services of several third\-party training providers to bolster internal provision on a wide range of institutional issues. Those attending the training see this approach as effective, as it offers specific information and practical advice to improve their effectiveness \[2\]. As a result, the Ministry has reinforced its efforts and budget in relation to its staff training programmes; it has notably spent 40,000 JD \(56,418 USD\) in 2019, a significant increase on prior years and also diversified its training programmes \[2\].

public and private investments often for regional growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research. Several projects are also concerned with sustainable practices in business and entrepreneurialism for a greener economy and with enabling more socially responsible corporate practices.",3.76,27.42,40.24,33.85,35.23,28.03,31,11,129,60,84,3,202,83,24,1,0.0208333333333333,0.1677898550724638,-0.0166666666666666,0.1078313681932102,0.0966666666666666,0.1074294744990109,1902

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Oxford’s INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Project, involving nearly 70,000 mothers and babies worldwide, has produced clinical tools to diagnose impaired growth and development in pregnancy and infancy, which standardise care for mothers and their babies. These international standards replace multiple local reference charts and provide benchmarks for health professionals everywhere: for example, by establishing the standard for microcephaly that was recommended by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the 2016 Zika virus outbreak. 

 For low\-to\-middle income countries, these standards have led to a reinterpretation of the number of deaths attributed to neonates born small for their gestational age. The INTERGROWTH\-21st Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards and feeding protocol have also been implemented by 370 neonatal units globally. 

 The standards are based on the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Project’s landmark finding: healthy mothers have babies that grow in a similar way in utero and achieve a similar size at birth, irrespective of their ancestry, ethnicity or place of birth.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The International Fetal & Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Project \(INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup>\) is a large, multicentre, population\-based research initiative, led by Professors Stephen Kennedy, José Villar and Aris Papageorghiou \(University of Oxford\). This work was done by a multidisciplinary network of more than 300 health care professionals and scientists from 35 institutions in 21 countries. Villar and Kennedy designed the studies, coordinated the network, managed the project, and analysed the data. Papageorghiou led the ultrasound and clinical dissemination components of the project. 

 The project, involving nearly 70,000 mothers and babies worldwide, was established to assess human growth, development and associated behaviours from early pregnancy to two years of age under: i\) healthy conditions \(Phase I\) and ii\) various sub\-optimal conditions \(e.g., maternal infections, malnutrition and pregnancy complications\) and other risk factors for adverse outcomes \(Phase II, currently ongoing\). The project’s guiding principle was that the main adverse perinatal outcomes \- fetal death, preterm birth and fetal growth restriction \- are highly heterogeneous, inter\-related syndromes that require targeted interventions focused on the underlying causes. 

 Phase I of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Project, conducted between 2009 \- 2016, consisted of five complementary studies designed to describe optimal human growth and development. The studies were based on the World Health Organization \(WHO\) prescriptive approach and took place across eight urban areas worldwide: these were geographically delimited to ensure the project was population\-based \[1\]. The study team tracked fetal growth throughout pregnancy from <14 weeks gestation in a large cohort of healthy women and continued to monitor their infants prospectively until they were two years old. At both population and individual levels, the participants had the recommended health, nutritional and socio\-economic status needed to produce international standards: the women were generally healthy, well\-nourished, and well\-educated, living freely in environments with minimal constraints on fetal growth, and receiving standardised, evidence\-based antenatal care. 

 The principal findings of the project are that early human growth and development are similar across diverse geographical settings when mothers’ nutritional and health needs are met, and environmental constraints on growth are low. These findings have a very strong public health message: healthy mothers have babies that grow in a similar way in utero and achieve a similar size at birth, irrespective of their ancestry, ethnicity, or place of birth \[2\]. 

 These studies led to the construction of a set of international standards for monitoring mothers and babies, using the WHO recommended prescriptive approach \[3, 4, 5\]. These include tools for: 1\) estimating gestational age in early and late pregnancy; 2\) monitoring gestational weight gain; 3\) measuring symphyseal\-fundal height \(SFH\); 4\) measuring fetal size and estimated fetal weight with ultrasound to monitor intrauterine growth; 5\) evaluating newborn size at birth, and 6\) monitoring the postnatal growth of preterm infants. Uniquely, the same healthy cohort was used to produce the entire set of tools \- the largest population ever assembled for such a longitudinal study. This is also the first time that a uniform method to describe fetal health and growth up to two years of age had been developed. 

 The children whose intrauterine ultrasound growth data were used to construct the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Fetal Growth Standards remained healthy with satisfactory growth and motor development up to two years of age, supporting the use of this cohort to construct international standards. 

 The INTER\-NDA tool, developed specifically for this project, was used to assess the sequence and timing of attainment of key neurodevelopmental milestones and associated behaviours among these children at two years of age, for implementation by non\-specialists across international settings. The children’s developmental patterns were similar across these geographically diverse populations in keeping with the associated low health, nutritional and environmental risks \[6\]. 

 These international standards, which perfectly complement the existing WHO Child Growth Standards, provide a unique set of clinical tools for use across all healthcare systems to diagnose impaired growth and development and standardise the care of pregnant women and their infants across the world.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Global uptake of INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards**In 2016, the team began the INTERPRACTICE\-21<sup>st</sup> Project to scale up global implementation of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards \[5\]. WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) have both recommended use of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards and feeding protocols \[A\]. As of 31 July 2020, 370 neonatal units around the world have implemented the standards and protocols in countries including Dubai, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the USA. The standards and protocols have also been adopted by national paediatric and neonatal societies and Ministries of Health, for example the National Paediatric Society of Argentina and the Italian Society of Neonatology. The standards seek to reduce the overdiagnosis of extrauterine growth restriction, which results in overfeeding that can lead to obesity and cardiometabolic disease in adulthood. Monitoring preterm infants with the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards, which describe optimal postnatal growth, reduces the risk of overfeeding. The feeding protocols detail how to feed a preterm infant, emphasising the use of human milk. 

####  UK Clinical Guidelines 

 In 2018, following an analysis of evidence to prevent stillbirths, the Scottish Government recommended the use of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Symphyseal\-fundal Height \(SFH\) Standards and Fetal Growth Standards for monitoring pregnancies \[3\]. A letter in November 2018 from the Children and Families Directorate of the Scottish Government, to Chief Executives, Medical Directors and Nurse Directors \[B\] states that *“The expert Scottish Government led Stillbirth Group has reviewed current evidence around accuracy of charts and recommends the use of Intergrowth 21<sup>st</sup> SFH and ultrasound growth charts which are free to use and readily available….”.* 

####  Use in perinatal patient data management and the Neonatology GIRFT project 

 The INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards, describing how a preterm infant should grow, have been integrated into BadgerNet, the pregnancy and neonatal unit data management system widely used across the NHS for the collection, storage and reporting of perinatal patient data. The raw data available in the BadgerNet system are being used by the Neonatology GIRFT Project to benchmark the extent to which preterm infants are growing optimally and to provide feedback to neonatal units on how well their patients are growing against the standards. The GIRFT Clinical Lead for Neonatology highlights how the data are being used: *“Thank you so much for providing GIRFT Neonatology with Z scores from both the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards and Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards for all premature babies admitted to neonatal units in England for the three year period 2016\-19. I have used the data to develop some benchmarking metrics to review growth between admission and discharge for babies at different gestational ages”* \[C\] *.* 

####  Establishing international standards for microcephaly 

 During the 2016 Zika virus \(ZIKV\) outbreak in Brazil the use of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards redefined the definition of microcephaly and led to changes in global practice and guidelines. On 8 December 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health changed its definition of microcephaly from head circumference at birth ≤33cm to ≤32cm, irrespective of the baby’s sex or gestational age at birth. In a letter to the Lancet in February 2016 a group of Brazilian epidemiologists argued to use the international INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards as these are sex and gestational age specific standards for optimal size at birth. Their use, they stated, could reduce the number of suspected cases in Brazil from an anticipated 600,000 to 63,000 or 3,000 for cut\-offs of \-2SD or \-3SD, respectively \[D\]. 

 WHO published an interim Rapid Advice Guideline in February 2016 and an update in August 2016 \[E\], which included the recommendation to use the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards for pre\-term neonates \(and for term neonates if accurate gestational age is known\) to interpret postnatal changes in head circumference until 64 weeks postmenstrual age. The CDC’s ZIKV management guidelines also recommend the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Fetal Growth Standards to assess head circumference at three points during pregnancy \[F\]. The use of a more specific definition of microcephaly focuses screening efforts, reduces the need for further investigations, and would also reduce the burden and costs on the health system. Furthermore, it alleviates the emotional effects on parents of healthy infants who might have otherwise been given a false\-positive result in the screening assessment \[D\]. The Brazilian Government subsequently adopted the standards for all pre\-term babies born in the country. 

####  Reinterpretation of existing newborn data in low\-middle income countries \(LMICs\) 

 In a 2015 JAMA paper, the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group at Johns Hopkins University concluded that using the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards rather than the US Birth Weight References reduced the prevalence of small for gestational age \(SGA\) in 16 LMIC cohorts without any effect on neonatal mortality \[G\], i.e. using the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards resulted in a decrease in the percentage of neonatal deaths attributable to SGA. In a 2017 *BMJ* paper, the same group selected the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards \[4\] as the most reliable tool for estimating the true prevalence of SGA in LMICs worldwide \[H\]. The revised 2012 data, using the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> definition, indicated that 23,300,000 infants were born SGA, with an estimated 606,500 attributable neonatal deaths, i.e. 21.9% of all neonatal deaths worldwide. 

  

####  Healthcare professional uptake and training 

 For implementation purposes, the study team made the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> clinical tools, publications, tables, charts, calculators, apps, and training resources freely downloadable \[Ii\]. Clinicians and health practioners are further supported through a number of training resources \[Iii\]. Between July 2014 and May 2020 the resources have been downloaded from The Global Health Network website 231,726 times by users in 195 countries and territories, and 23,580 healthcare professionals have been trained using INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> e\-learning modules \[J\]. 

 In 2019, The Global Health Network conducted an online survey of website users \(hospitals/health centres 57.0%; universities 19.9%; NGOs 15.1%; Health Ministries/ others 8.0%\). The following percentages of these users had introduced the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards into clinical practice in their institutions: pregnancy dating 43.2%; symphyseal\-fundal height 31.6%; fetal growth by ultrasound 40.1%; newborn size 56.4%; gestational weight gain 34.9%, and preterm postnatal growth 50.6%. More than 100 health care professionals have been trained to deliver the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Neurodevelopment Package \(INTER\-NDA\), which has been used to assess the neurodevelopment of over 15,000 2\-year old children in 14 countries. The operation manuals and protocols for the INTER\-NDA are freely available \[Iiii\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Research Unit for Research Utilisation \(RURU; www.ruru.ac.uk\) researches and promotes better ways of getting research\-based knowledge used in public policy making and public service delivery. This case study focuses on RURU’s influence on 5 agencies that help decision makers and practitioners find and make best use of research to address policy and practice problems. These agencies operate in different sectors \(education, healthcare and social care\) and are indicative of the breadth and depth of RURU’s research influence. The significance of this influence is that it has helped to *transform thinking* about the process of research use and has also shaped *actions* \(strategies, resource deployment and practices\) to enhance research use across multiple agencies. For example, the Education Endowment Fund has drawn on RURU’s research to develop a systems\-based approach to mobilising evidence, including funding a national network of 37 schools that support the use of evidence to improve teaching practice within other schools. Within social care, Research in Practice \(RiP\) has drawn on RURU’s work to position social work professionals as active agents in knowledge creation and use. This approach has assisted RiP to almost double the size of its member network since 2013, and it now reaches over 10,000 people \(social work professionals\) each year through its learning events and resources.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research has been conducted since 2000. It focuses on understanding how research is or is not used in public policy and practice and how such use can be enhanced. It has been carried out in the context of sustained international interest in evidence\-based policy, evidenced\-based practice, and the persistent challenge of ensuring that research is used in these settings. 

 The main insights from the underpinning research are summarised as follows: 

-  Articulation of research use is a complex, social, interactive, and context\-dependent process, in which research is more likely to be adapted than simply adopted \[R1; R2\]. 

-  Production and refinement of a taxonomy of strategies to improve the use of research that identifies 5 key underlying mechanisms: dissemination; interaction; social influence; facilitation; and incentives/reinforcement \[R1; R2\]. 

-  Formulation of 3 models of evidence\-based practice \(the research\-based practitioner model, the embedded research model, and the organisation\-excellence model\) \[R2; R3\]. 

-  Reviews of the evidence about the success or otherwise of different strategies and mechanisms for increasing research use and impact, leading to recognition that research use is enhanced by: sustained interactions between researchers and research users; the use of multiple mechanisms to encourage research use; and the development of a supportive context for research\-based practice \[R1; R2\]. 

-  Identification that for research to be useful and used, findings from individual studies need to be situated within a wider body of research and integrated with other sources of knowledge \[R2; R4\]. 

-  Recognition that strategies that are system\-based and target a broad range of actors \(including those funding research, producing research and using research\) are more likely to increase research use and impact \[R3\]. 

-  Articulation of the detailed factors supporting the use of research in policy and practice: the need for a catalyst, organisational capacity to engage with research, and a series of research engagement actions \[R5\]. 

-  Provision of evidence that increasing the knowledge and skills of researchers and policymakers to engage with one another and appraise research evidence is likely to lead to the appropriate application of research in policy \[R5\]. 

-  Development of 8 key archetypes \(sets of assumptions, actions, configurations and rationales\) that capture the differing the strategies and approaches of knowledge mobilisation intermediaries \[R6\]. 

-  Evidence that the research use strategies and approaches of research funders, producers and intermediaries are shaped by many factors, often developed in isolation and rarely evaluated, leading to a need to facilitate cross\-sector and interagency learning and reflection \[R6\] 

 The above insights are drawn from peer\-reviewed systematic review studies \(e.g. R1\), peer\-reviewed mixed method empirical studies \(e.g. R5; R6\), and studies that have combined elements of both \(e.g. R3\). There have also been landmark synthesis publications that draw together the key findings from a range of studies \(e.g. R2\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 RURU’s research into better ways of getting research used in public policy and practice has influenced the thinking, strategies and practices of **research funders** and **research intermediaries across different sectors \(e.g. education, healthcare and social care\) and in various jurisdictions \(e.g. UK and Australia\). An independent survey of an international community of scholars, practitioners and funders concerned with the use of research \( *n* = 102\) asked respondents to name researchers who had influenced their own work. RURU’s research \[R2\] was *“the only one which was nominated by people from multiple fields and by far the most frequently”* \[S1 – data and commentary from one of the survey researchers based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\]. 

 Details of RURU’s specific influence are outlined below. In general, this influence has been facilitated by the way in which members of the unit have sought to engage with research funders and research intermediaries both during the research process and following the publication of findings. This has involved working with many bodies \(see examples below\) as they seek to understand the implications of RURU’s research for their organisations. RURU’s influence has also been achieved by ‘secondary links’ as existing users apply, cite and recommend RURU’s work to others \(see, for example, RiP and Iriss below\). 

 **Influence on the strategies and practices of research funding bodies** 

 Since August 2013, RURU’s influence is evident in the design of the strategies and practices of at least 4 research funding bodies \(The Education Endowment Fund, the National Institute for Health Research, the Economic and Social Research Council, and the WT Grant Foundation\). Details relating to the first two of these are provided below. 

 **The Education Endowment Fund \(** [**EEF**](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/) **\)** is a major funder of education research in the UK, but it is not just a grant funder. It also supports teachers and senior leaders to raise the attainment of children facing disadvantage by helping them to make best use of available evidence. RURU’s research \[R2; R4\] has informed the design of research projects \(GBP3,200,000 funding allocated\) to understand how schools and system leaders engage with, understand and use research, which in turn has influenced national and international policy on evidence use \[S2\]. 

 Between 2013 and 2016, Nutley was an adviser to the EEF and, drawing on RURU’s research; she helped to transform EEF’s approach to improving research use. “ *\[The\] EEF was mobilising its research predominately using traditional communication and dissemination methods… RURU research \[R1; R2\] highlights the limitations of that approach, emphasising the importance of interactions and relationships between research producers, users and intermediaries. With the help of Prof. Nutley, the EEF adopted a more systems\-based approach to mobilising evidence, involving the strategic alignment of activities based on dissemination, interaction, social influence, facilitation and incentives* *\[R1; R2\]*… *e.g. \[by\] influencing national policy and creating local infrastructure for research\-informed practice”* \[S2 \- testimony from the Professor Research Fellow in the EEF’s Dissemination and Impact Team\]. 

 In creating an appropriate local infrastructure, the EEF drew on RURU’s research about the social, interactive nature of research use \[R2\] to develop the Research Schools Network, a national network of 37 schools across England. Research Schools work with the other schools in their areas to help them use evidence more effectively to inform their teaching \(GBP8,000,000 invested as of November 2020 \- \[S2\]\). An independent evaluation suggests that the Research School Network is playing a vital role in shifting cultures and attitudes towards evidence use \[S2; S3, p.6\]. 

 **The National Institute for Health Research \(** [**NIHR**](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/) **\)** funds health\-related research in the UK. RURU’s research on the importance of interactions between researchers and research users \[R1; R2; R6\] has influenced its strategies, priorities and practices. A key pathway to this influence has been Davies’ ongoing interaction with NIHR. His advice \(based on RURU’s research described in Section 2\) shaped the design of collaborative partnerships between universities and surrounding NHS organisations. Between 2013 and 2018, NIHR invested GBP124,000,000 in 13 Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care \(CLAHRCs\) \[S4\]. These local partnerships were selected for funding on the basis of their alignment with RURU\-derived principles about the nature of research use and the importance of sustained interaction \[S5, p. 204\]. Davies was invited to chair the funding panel. 

 In 2013, RURU's insights about the lack of high\-quality research on appropriate training and support for knowledge mobilisation \[R2\] led to the introduction of a research aspect to NIHR’s Knowledge Mobilisation Training Fellowships. This had the specific aim of developing a critical mass of individuals who can lead and champion research\-based knowledge mobilisation in applied health research. Again, Davies was invited to chair the funding panel for the first 3 years of this fellowship scheme. Evidence of the influence of RURU’s research on this training scheme is provided by the Director of Programmes and Impact \(NIHR Academy\), who reported in 2020 that “ *his \[Davies’\] expertise and research was invaluable in shaping the scheme… and in influencing some significant changes to the scheme in 2013... The influence of the research of RURU means knowledge mobilisation and the guidance given to applicants for NIHR Advanced Fellowships, remains an important theme for these career development awards”* \[S6\]. 

 **Influence on the thinking and actions of intermediaries supporting policy and practice development** 

 RURU’s influence has been particularly marked amongst those working in intermediary bodies tasked with improving the use of research in public services. Since 2013, RURU’s influence is evident in the shifting approaches of a least six national intermediary bodies \(including the Children and Young People's Centre for Justice, NHS Healthcare Improvement Scotland, and the National Co\-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement\). The three examples below are drawn from Australia and the UK. Amongst these intermediaries, there has been a largescale shift in language and thinking around research use away from passive dissemination towards more active ‘knowledge mobilisation’ and a more encompassing view of what counts as evidence and knowledge. Through the actions of these intermediaries, RURU’s research has indirectly supported the development of improved public services through better application of evidence. 

 **Research in Practice \(RiP\)** works with a membership network of 127 local authorities and 12 national charities in England to support them to access and apply evidence in their work with children, families and adults. Since 2013, RiP has drawn on RURU’s work \[R2; R3\] to position social work professionals as active agents in knowledge creation and use rather than passive recipients of research. RiP’s approach has enabled it to grow in size and influence. Its network has almost doubled in size since September 2013, and RiP now reaches over 10,000 people \(social work professionals\) each year through its learning events and resources \[S7\]. 

 In particular, *“RURU’s work… has heavily influenced our operating model and the way we communicate with the social care and wider family support sector”* \[S7 – testimony from the Director of RiP\]. In 2014, RiP drew on the three models of evidence\-based practice \[R3\] to inform their contact model with members. “ *These models are still used with new members joining the network to help them articulate their ambitions for a more evidence\-informed practice.”* \[S7\] In 2015, RURU’s research on the conceptual use of research \[R2; R3\] was used to underpin a large programme of work focused on reflective supervision \[S7\]. More recently, in 2020, RURU’s research on the five mechanisms for improving research use \[R1; R2\] was used to underpin the launch of RiP’s Outcomes First Group, which supports evidence\-informed child\-centred practice and leadership \[S8, slide 19\]. 

 Overall, “ *by drawing on RURU’s work, RiP has been able to articulate ‘evidence\-informed practice’ as a means of reflecting and addressing… criticisms of the overly rigid nature of programmatic evidence implementation… this approach – inspired and informed by RURU’s work – resonates strongly within the sector”* \[S7\]. The main pathways to RURU’s influence on RiP have been through the targeted dissemination of RURU’s research and via discussions with RiP staff at numerous seminars and workshops on ways of improving research use. 

 **The Sax Institute** is the national lead agency promoting the use of research evidence in Australian health policy. In response to RURU’s work on research use and knowledge mobilisation, the Chief Executive of the  [Sax Institute](https://www.saxinstitute.org.au/) asked Davies to help them redesign their process of evidence engagement. Between 2011 and 2019, Davies collaborated with the Institute’s Centre for Informing Policy in Health with Evidence from Research \( [CIPHER](https://australia.cochrane.org/centre-informing-policy-health-evidence-research-cipher)\). The first stage of the collaboration involved the development of the SPIRIT Action Framework \[R5\], which drew on key insights from RURU’s research \[R2; R6\]. *“Drawing on RURU’s research… Professor Davies contributed extensively to our CIPHER program, helping us structure our thinking and develop more effective methods for capturing and honing our intent.”* \[S9 – testimony from the Chief Executive of the Sax Institute\] 

 The collaborative team then sought to test the effectiveness of the Action Framework through a step\-wedge trial \[S10\]. The CIPHER trial found that the intervention had strengthened the capacity of the six trial agencies to find and use research \[R5; S9\]. The trial led to the creation of new capacities within the Sax Institute, including a training program for early career researchers on working in partnership with policy agencies and training for policy makers on critical appraisal and evaluation \[S9\]. Since their launch, these programs have reached over 500 people \(policymakers\) from 60 government and non\-government agencies across Australia \[S11, p. 2\]. 

 **The Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services \(Iriss\)** is a charity that builds the capacity and capability of the Scottish social services workforce to access and make use of knowledge and evidence for service improvement. RURU’s research has had a significant impact on the thinking and actions of Iriss: “ *The overall basis of how Iriss functions as an organisation has continually been informed by and shaped by RURU research.”* \[S12 – testimony from the Head of Delivery, Iriss\]. The pathway for this impact has been though the targeted dissemination of RURU’s research and through Iriss staff regularly attending RURU’s seminars and workshops since 2012. Several examples of this influence are listed below. 

-  Iriss has used RURU’s research on the eight archetypes that capture the different aims and approaches of knowledge intermediaries \[R6\] to articulate its own approach as “ *We inform; We translate; and We co\-create. This has formed the backbone of how we project ourselves to the sector”* \[S12\]. 

-  Iriss’s focus on creating conditions for effective information sharing, supporting individuals and groups to make use of evidence and working with communities to develop and test ideas for change, has been heavily influenced by RURU’s research \[R2\] on strategies to improve the use of research \[S12\]. 

-  Iriss’s Evidence Search and Summary Service \(ESSS\) is underpinned by RURU’s insights \[R2; R4\] into the need to integrate research evidence with knowledge from other sources \[S12\]. The ESSS is designed to receive live enquires on topics from social services practitioners and incorporate evidence from research, practice and experience in order to support people working within social services \[S12\]. 

 Iriss also has shared RURU’s framing of evidence and evidence use with other agencies when collaborating on the development of sector\-wide strategies. For example, Iriss worked with organisations across the social service sector in Scotland \(including Scottish Social Services Council, Care Inspectorate, Scottish Care, Coalition of Care and Support Providers Scotland\) to develop a joint evidence\-use statement as part of the Social Services Strategy between 2015 and 2020. This statement drew on RURU research \[R2\] to help frame what effective use of evidence looks like and acknowledges the need for multifaceted ways to promote research use \[S12\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research into human\-robot interaction, in which the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems \(CRNS\) plays a leading international role, has demonstrated the significant benefit of social robots for technological support in domains where personal interaction is essential. Funded by 11.9 million GBP in large\-scale European grants, Plymouth’s innovative social robotics research developed and promoted applications of social robots for personalised and long\-term interaction. Responding to societal challenges \-specifically the need to address population ageing, the need to deliver personalised education, or the need for novel mental health support\- the centre collaborates with leading manufacturers, such as Softbank Robotics, and transnational policy makers, to shape societal, governmental and industrial decision\-making to invest in social robots, having an impact on the nascent social robotics market valued at over 1B USD.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research at the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems \(CRNS\) hinges on the observation that people, from children to adults, treat robots as social agents. Both the robots’ appearance and behaviour promote the attribution of social characteristics, and it is the latter that the CRNS focuses on. Using techniques from artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and signal processing, the team builds social robots that can be used to support children, adults and the elderly in a range of settings. While the research often is foundational, the methods and insights gained are applied to force breakthroughs in application domains ranging from therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorders \[3.1\], to education \[3.2\], and support for the elderly \[3.3\]. 

  

 The CRNS is interdisciplinary and consists of computer scientists, engineers, cognitive scientists, and healthcare workers, which allows a smooth collaboration with medical professionals, pedagogists, linguists, psychologists and service users and providers often across international borders. 

  

 The CRNS take a two\-pronged approach to Human\-Robot Interaction: working on the technical aspects as well as on the cognitive science underlying HRI \[3.4\]. In the latter, for example, the CRNS studied trust and social influence between people and robots, looking at which cognitive mechanisms are at play and what elements of the robot lead to changes in trust and social peer pressure \[3.5\]. This is complemented with technical research, for example the interactive machine learning work for social robots \[3.6\] or the deep learning for social signal processing \[3.7\]. Finally, most of the research has had applied impact, with research results forming the foundations for applications in healthcare, elderly care, education and edutainment. As such, the CRNS’ research output not only captured the attention of international colleagues in academia, but was also picked up by policymakers, national and international industries working on automation and robotics and has had an impact on public attitudes towards social robots. 

  

 The research in social robots at Plymouth attracted 11.9 million GBP in funding since 2014, the majority of which came from large research projects initiated and coordinated by the CRNS. The FP7 ALIZ\-E project, the H2020 L2TOR and the EPIC Regional Development Project introduced the use of robots as social support mechanisms in healthcare, education and regional elderly care respectively. Our research was noticed far beyond national borders, with the US Air Force investing in research on trust in social robots through the THRIVE project, or Softbank Robotics Europe headquartered in Paris initiating a doctoral training collaboration with Plymouth through the H2020 APRIL European Industrial Doctorate network. 

  

 Next to these initiatives, the University of Plymouth also was a key partner in several other high\-profile projects. For example, the FP7 DREAM project studied the use of social robots for Autism Spectrum Disorder therapy, FP7 ROBOT\-ERA focused on social human\-robot interaction to support independent living for the elderly, and the H2020 SECURE Initial Training Network studied the safe physical interaction with robots.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Commercial robots** 

 The CRNS, under the lead of **Belpaeme** and **Cangelosi**, has thriving knowledge transfer partnerships with key players in the social robotics industry. The recent work for example in the H2020 L2TOR project, which studied the use of social robots to support children in education, has led to considerable commercial interest. Embodied Inc., a start\-up in the California, has based its Moxie robot on Plymouth’s research \[5.1\] and Softbank Robotics Europe \(SBRE\) adopted robot tutors in their strategic vision, showcasing the use of robot tutors in their Paris headquarters as a future market for their social robots \[5.2\]. Plymouth has a longstanding relation with SBRE, who developed and sell the two most popular social robot platforms, the Nao and the Pepper humanoids. SBRE and Plymouth have collaborated since 2010 through four EU projects \(FP7 ALIZ\-E, FP7 DREAM, H2020 L2TOR, H2020 APRIL\) which SBRE match funded for a total of 522,717 EUR, demonstrating a sustained relationship with the global leader in commercial social robotics. 

 The centre also has long\-standing relationship with Zorabots, a leading social robot solutions provider based in Belgium. The company sells robots which consist of imported hardware with bespoke social robotics software. The collaboration, which originated in 2014 during a joint EU research project, continues with Zorabots relying on research from Plymouth to steer their commercial offer. Zorabots collaborates with Plymouth to scout application areas and to procure or develop technical solutions and AI to support social interaction on robots. In 2019 Zorabots, when employing 15 people FET, attracted a VC injection of 10 million EUR spread over 3 years by Versluys group allowing it to invest in new robots and development of software. Tommy Deblieck, co\-CEO, says “ *We relied on the expertise of the Plymouth team and Prof Belpaeme specifically to expand into social robotics, a nascent market which was brought to our attention by Plymouth’s research*.” \[5.3\] 

 Zorabots achieved worldwide attention during the Covid\-19 crisis, when they made their social robots available to care homes for free to use as a telepresence robots and to monitor for Covid\-19 symptoms and the correct wearing of PPE. In 2020, the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) purchased Zorabots robots to distribute to understaffed hospitals in Rwanda to support their Covid\-19 efforts. Again, these applications are an outcome of the collaboration started with the CRNS, as software and expertise was used in the robot deployed during the pandemic \[5.3 & 5.4\]. 

 Finally, Gaudl works for borobo Ltd, a UK\-based robotics and design start\-up founded in 2018 in London with the aim to develop novel interaction and design concepts to enrich user experiences. In 2019, borobo was attracted to the Southwest due to the support and strong connection to the research of the University of Plymouth through the EPIC project. Borobo collaborates with Plymouth and Edinburgh Robotics. Their current robot, Maah, marketed as a “sentient domestic artefact” and part of their Konpanion brand is designed as a low\-cost social robot that offers companionship and investigates ways of helping with isolation. 

 **Robots for therapy and care** 

 The work in the ALIZ\-E, DREAM, and EPIC projects involved evaluating social robots in medical and healthcare settings. This required a mentality shift in the institutions we worked with \(for example, San Rafaelle hospital  in Milan, Italy, Kernow Health, UK, The patients association, UK and the Meander Ziekenhuis in Amersfoort, NL\), and has resulted in a culture change across many healthcare and care institutions. Plymouth’s work on social robotics in healthcare is showcased in professional periodicals and medical conferences \(e.g. in 2019 Belpaeme was keynote speaker at the Innovation in Paediatrics Symposium, Amsterdam, and in 2020 he lectured on the potential of social robots at the ORSI Academy in Melle, Belgium\). These efforts have helped move attitudes from cautious scepticism to active participation in social robotics trials and deployments \[5.5\]. For example, Thill and Belpaeme were involved in the first randomised control trial proving the effectiveness of robot therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorders \(ASD\), which relied on a collaboration with the Babes\-Bolyai clinic in Cluj \(Romania\) to test 70 children with ASD \[5.6\]. The focus on healthcare not only has a long\-term horizon, but has immediate effects, such as the prompt adoption of robots in healthcare during the Covid\-19 crisis \[5.4\]. 

 The EPIC projects \(E\-health Productivity and Innovation in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly\), funded by the European Regional Development Fund project and involving Belpaeme, Cangelosi and Gaudl, looked at how social robotics and eHealth can serve to meet the needs of fragmented care, as for example found in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Due to its expected positive impact on healthcare, the project received a new round of funding running until 2023 of £4.15M, including investment of £255,000 from local SMEs. As part of EPIC, two robotics companies were founded and 97 additional SMEs were closely engaged and supported, based on the environment created through the University of Plymouth. One of the new companies is Robotriks Ltd., founded in 2018 by Plymouth graduate Jake Shaw\-Sutton Gibson and employing 2 staff, which designed and built the social robot ComPet in collaboration with the CRNS. 

 **Public awareness and policy** 

 The Organisation on Economic Cooperation and Development recruited Belpaeme and other thought leaders in smart education to author a policy document for their OECD Centre for Educational Research and Innovation. The document is used to support OECD member governments in future proofing education \[8\]. The joint work between Plymouth and Zorabots resulted in an invitation to shape the EU’s Civil Law Rules on Robotics initiative chaired by Mrs. Maddy Delvaux \(MEP\), for which both parties were regularly consulted and invited to the European Parliament \[5.9\]. 

 Foundational insights and research have had considerable impact beyond academia. The work on social peer pressure by robots attracted widespread media attention in 2018 following the publication of the research results in Science Robotics. The news was picked up by over 150 global news outlets, including Science, BBC, and New Scientist. The topic was debated during a Facebook Live event of Science magazine which was viewed by 6.3K viewers and led to invitations for keynotes to Belpaeme at public events. Based on the work with start\-up borobo, Gaudl was invited to present the 2019 IET Christmas lecture on the future of robotics. Since 2014 the work on social robotics has featured in dozens of international media outlets, including printed press \(New Scientist, Le Monde, the Guardian, Scientific American, …\) and television \(BBC, NBC, CNN, National Geographic, …\) and was part of a 4D video installation at the London Science Museum’s blockbuster exhibition on robots in 2017. 

 **Belpaeme** and his team contributed to several TV\-programmes for UK television, including Channel 4’s “The robot will see you now”, in which Belpaeme presented the science of social robots and their use in therapy, and BBC2’s “Six robots and us”, which aired in two parts during the primetime evening slot over Christmas 2017. The programmes showed how robots will integrate in our lives in a not too distant future and what the potential applications of robots are in care and retail.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In a context of increasing nature depletion, our research is benefitting nature and people by informing the regulation and implementation of species restoration and reintroduction programmes, as well as international approaches to ‘rewilding’. At the local level, it has been used to make decisions on UK reintroductions of the lynx and beaver, and to implement species reintroduction and community engagement programmes for some of the UK’s most deprived communities. At the global level, it has underpinned rewilding policy at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and prompted the organisation to issue new definitions, guidelines and standards. These will support the international conservation community to use rewilding strategies as means of addressing global declines in biodiversity and reconnecting people with nature. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2008, and through the Centre for Wildlife Conservation \(2008\-2016\) and Centre for National Parks and Protected Areas \(2016\-Present\), a body of conceptual and empirical research has been conducted contributing to the field of rewilding and the relationships between people and communities. Rewilding has emerged over the last 20 years from its roots as a radical conservation movement in the US, to the conservation mainstream; encapsulating philosophical and ecological transformative landscape\-level change in conservation. However, as the ‘vision’ of rewilding has spread more widely, it has taken on a variety of subsidiary and often contradictory meanings, generating confusion, uncertainty and trepidation amongst some communities, and in some cases, entrenching divisions between conservationists and other groups. 

 R1 examined the ‘Wild Ennerdale’ \(WE\) initiative in the English Lake District, and its key findings articulated the disparities between WE’s view of engagement and participation and the corresponding feelings of alienation, dispossession, and dislocation expressed by some members of the local community. R2 demonstrated public support for reintroductions \(in this case, the White\-tailed sea eagle\) and reinforced the need for early community engagement to ensure wide and longer term support for ‘rewilding’ programmes and initiatives. Taking a more global outlook, R3 examined the significant potential of rewilding for progressive conservation, but pointed to its current fragmentation as a clear limiting factor needing to be addressed. 

 In 2016, Convery was appointed Co\-Chair of the newly\-formed ‘Rewilding Task Group’ \(RTG\) of the ‘Commission on Ecosystem Management’ \- one of the six commissions providing ‘ *know\-how and policy advice’* to the International Union for Conservation and Nature \(IUCN\) – *‘the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it’*. Following the establishment of the RTG, Convery led a programme of engagement and consultation, leading to a set of rewilding principles to be adopted by the IUCN. These principles, which emerged from engagement with ‘rewilding pioneers’, at workshops in Florida, London, the Society for Ecological Restoration conference in Cape Town \(September 2019\), and Tsinghua University Beijing \(October 2019\), are outlined on the IUCN website. Subsequently, Convery co\-authored R4, a spatial meta\-analysis which identified priority areas for conservation, and proposed ‘cost effective zones’ which could be targeted to increase protected area designation. 

 Building on Convery’s work with the IUCN, and through R2, and R1, further research and development has been undertaken on community based reintroductions of flora and fauna for rewilding. This includes R6 on the public engagement and proposed reintroduction of the Eurasian lynx to Kielder Forest, conducted 2017\-2019. The findings presented in R6 suggested that lynx should not be reintroduced, highlighting the critical nature of community involvement. In this case, information sharing and transparent communications constrained public participation.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Context:** As we enter a 6<sup>th</sup> mass extinction, global protected areas and the traditional model of protectionism conservation are failing. Rewilding offers a new approach, and the idea that we can \(re\)create natural habitats and wild landscapes simply by allowing wildlife and natural processes to reclaim areas of land has captured scientific and public imagination. However, the lack of consistent use and a universally accepted definition of rewilding has led to misrepresentation in both practice and policy application, leading to conflict, and negative outcomes for people and nature. In a context of nature depletion and increased awareness of nature’s role in sustaining mental and physical health, our relationship with nature must improve. Our research has sought to catalyse change at a global and coordinated scale with people and communities at the centre. 

 **Impact 1: New International regulation and guidance for rewilding** 

 The International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) is the global authority on the status of the natural world and measures needed to safeguard it. Its members include 208 states and government agencies \(e.g. DEFRA, UK, and Department of State, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, USA\), and 1200\+ NGOs and indigenous peoples organisations \(e.g. National Geographic Society, World Wildlife Fund\). The IUCN World Conservation Congress sets strategic direction every four years, informed by an active network of scientific advisors across six ‘commissions’. The Commission for Ecosystems Management \(CEM\) focuses on *“promoting ecosystem\-based approaches for the management of landscapes and seascapes”.* Convery convened the CEM’s first Rewilding Task Force, following invitation from the CEM Chair \(S1\), to deliver two aims: 1\) develop a proposal for ‘Rewilding’ to become a CEM thematic groups; and 2\) develop ‘rewilding guiding principles’ for IUCN adoption. This represents a global first – an internationally recognised ‘rewilding’ definition; utilised on a global scale by the conservation community, with coordination and monitoring \(in a similar way to the IUCN red list\). 

 The first of these aims was achieved in April 2020, with the IUCN formally adopting ‘rewilding’ as a CEM theme. This transition and IUCN adoption was underpinned by Convery’s research and evidence base, which has affected IUCN policy direction and provides permanence within the IUCN system: taking rewilding as a means of addressing biodiversity loss into mainstream conservation. The second aim was achieved in November 2020, with the CEM publishing the ‘Rewilding Principles’ online outlining and a new definition for rewilding already adopted by the Global Charter for Rewilding Earth \(Wilderness Foundation, 2020\) \(S2i\). The principles have been endorsed by many leading scientists, including the lead author of the ""Global Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A second Notice"" \(November 2017\), which included 15,364 scientist co\-signatories from 184 countries \(S9\). 

 The Rewilding Principles, and their significance, have been formalised further as part of Resolution 085 \(S2ii\), accepted and approved by the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2020. The resolution notes *“the emergence of rewilding as a new, cost\-effective approach to enhancing biodiversity, connectivity, ecological resilience and ecosystem service delivery”*. It calls on the Director General \(DG\) to establish an IUCN\-wide working group to agree adoption of the rewilding principles, and “ *to develop parameters and guidelines for applying rewilding approaches,”* and “ *submit to Council an evidence\-based IUCN Policy on rewilding*,” encouraging “ *the DG, Commissions and Members to use this Policy to promote rigorously planned and participatory rewilding approaches as a way to reinstate or enhance ecosystem function\(s\) and viable species populations.”* 

 This represents a significant moment for the IUCN and will lead to internationally recognised regulations and guidelines for rewilding and centralised monitoring and reporting. This policy change is significant as the IUCN sets several international standards, such as for reintroductions and translocations \(moving animals/plants\). ‘Rewilding’ will therefore be subject to the same levels of scrutiny and international standards. This resolution was originally due to be ratified in July 2020 as part of ‘Motion 100’ at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, Marseille. However, due to Covid\-19, Congress was postponed to September 2021, but chose to adopt the resolution outside of the meeting in December 2020 so that work can start \(S2iii\). This represents a change in IUCN policy, and an important moment for rewilding to become a critical tool in addressing global climate change and species loss. 

 **Impact 2: Research informed decisions on UK reintroductions of the Lynx and Beaver** 

 In addition to research on ‘rewilding principles’ being utilised at the international regulatory scale, Convery has worked at a national scale in relation to their early adoption and implementation in practice. This includes a research\-informed review of the public consultation to reintroduce the Lynx to Kielder Forest, Northumberland, recommending it <ins>not</ins> to proceed due to insufficient consultation and potential negative impact. 

 UOC \(Convery as lead\) together with AECOM and Clifford Chance, worked with the Lynx UK Trust on the proposal to reintroduce the Lynx to the UK **.** This included community engagement and consultation processes on the reintroduction. An *Interim Community Consultation Report* \(2017\) recommended that insufficient communication and engagement had been carried out, threatening the longer\-term viability of the project.  This recommendation \(latterly published as R6\) was cited in Natural England correspondence \(S3\) to the \(then\) Secretary of State \(SOS\), Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, who had decided to *“take this decision myself”* \(S5\) on the Lynx reintroduction. The Natural England correspondence to the SOS stated that: *“Further engagement with the local community, recommended in the consultants’ report, was not followed up and involvement with landowners and the local community has been a concern throughout.”* This correspondence ultimately led to the SOS’s non\-adoption of policy in relation to the Lynx reintroduction, reiterating Natural England’s stance \(underpinned by the report\) that *“the proposal did not demonstrate sufficient local support for the project”*. It was additionally cited by Northumberland National Park in their advice to Natural England on the proposed reintroduction \(S4\). 

  

 This collaborative project with AECOM and Clifford Chance also led to the establishment of a new wildlife conservation NGO \- the Lifescape Project, which designs and undertakes conservation projects aiming to support wildlife, transform landscapes, and help to provide a future for all life. Convery was invited to be a Director, and a key output has been the establishment of the ‘Natural Capital Laboratory’ which involves ‘rewilding’ 100 acres of land in the Highlands of Scotland with an aim to restore native forest, inspire people to connect with the environment, and reintroduce locally extinct species. Convery serves on the Steering Committee with responsibility for ensuring activity is research informed. The research, including R5 and R4, has informed AECOM’s development of the Digital Natural Capital Account \(S8\) which allows the public to explore the Natural Capital Laboratory \- with photos, videos and audio bringing to life the habitats and species present, as well as the ecosystem services and values they provide. This account is a ‘live’ record, and updates as activities, data, conditions, and environmental and social values change over time, stimulating public interest and engagement in research on rewilding. 

 UOC has a strong partnership with Cumbria Wildlife Trust \(see Impact 3\), and this led to involvement in the Cumbria Beaver Group. Building on his research on reintroductions \(R2\) and community consultation \(R5\), Convery, as an invited member of the Group, contributed to the evidence base, the community consultation, and IUCN protocols which informed the approach to DEFRA for approval of the Beaver’s reintroduction to the Lowther Estate in Cumbria \(S10i\). As a result of this combined approach, the first beaver five\-year trial in the North West was approved in January 2020, with two species released in October 2020. The beaver is now present in Cumbria for the first time in 400 years, and has generated significant public interest \(S10ii\). 

 **Impact 3: Implementing ‘rewilding principles’ to support wildlife and communities** 

 Convery leads a knowledge exchange and research programme \(‘Back On Our Map’ \[BOOM\]\), which received one\-year ‘development’ funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund \(NLHF\) \(£174,500, 2017\-18\) followed by a ‘delivery’ grant \(£1,265,200, 2019\-2023\). BOOM is a four\-year project commencing in 2019 with an overall aim to restore, via citizen science and community participation, up to 12 species of flora and fauna to South Cumbria. 

 The development phase involved species feasibility work with stakeholders and an extensive consultation programme with affected communities, and the quality of the consultation helped the project to meet the *“high quality threshold”* and to be a *“high priority for funding”* at the NLHF Board of Trustees meeting \(26 March 2019\) \(S7\). The development phase engaged with 526 individuals across 10 locations; enhancing public understanding of ‘lost’ species \(and how species influence our cultural heritage, place names etc.\), and informing public attitudes around species reintroductions. This included events in Barrow\-in\-Furness, where 24.5% of the District’s Lower Super Output Areas \(c1500 people\) represent the highest decile \(1 of 10\) of multiple deprivation. In this context, the project gave a ‘voice’ to Barrow communities, stimulating interest in conservation and allowing them to ultimately shape the ‘delivery’ phase. This included: ensuring a budget for transporting participants to reintroduction sites \(as residents highlighted this as a potential barrier\); local nature\-related craft with local Mind groups, planting and growing activities, and children’s activities. Since the project commenced in September 2019, and despite the Covid\-19 restrictions, BOOM delivered the following outcomes for wildlife by the end of 2020 \(S6i\): 

-  3000 Cowslips grown and planted volunteers as food plants for Duke of Burgundy butterflies 

-  680 aspen trees planted in south Cumbria, a species which is seen as a potential replacement for the ash, with ash dieback expected to kill around 80% of the UK’s species. 

-  20 cameras placed at sites in Grizedale Forest to identify pine marten populations and establish a case for their reintroduction at this site. 

 Outcomes for people include: 

-  Establishment of a new community growing area in Barrow\-in\-Furness, and provision of a polytunnel, equipment and training opportunities for local people. 

-  Training for 54 individuals on dormouse reintroduction and aspen cultivation. 

-  Prisoners at Haverigg creating and caring for their own woodland inside the prison grounds, benefitting mental health and transition into the community, and enabling prisoners to acquire conservation skills. The prison’s community outreach manager said working with BOOM had brought many benefits: *“The project has meant our residents are able to make an invaluable contribution to native tree cultivation and improving wildlife across the area”* \(S6ii, iii\). 

-  147 children growing meadow wildflowers during the UK’s first Covid\-19 lockdown. 

-  19 Students involved in surveying, site tasks and interpretation. 

-  67 people involved in consultation, talks and awareness raising events. 

-  145 volunteer workdays achieved \(7 hours/day\) with 75 new volunteers, 22 from areas of high indices of multiple deprivation \(116 registered in total on the volunteer database\). 

-  15 ‘Grow at Home’ volunteers to continue growing during future Covid restrictions. 

-  Creation of a 0.6FTE ‘Community Engagement Officer’, funded by the project, but employed by Morecambe Bay Partnership \(MBP\) as a means of facilitating engagement with communities across the project area across BOOM and other MBP projects. 

 The project would not have been possible \(in both phases\) without the underpinning research and evidence base, championed by Convery internally and amongst regional stakeholders and partners, including Natural England, Forestry Commission, Cumbria Wildlife Trust and MBP.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dimitris Papanikolaou’s research on queer theory, sexual identity and the critique of homophobia has contributed to a change in the ways gender/sexual identity and its cultural expression are treated in Greece. Papanikolaou’s work on queering canonical poet Constantine Cavafy has contributed to a reframing of the literary and cultural canon by bringing into focus hitherto silenced issues. Subsequent exploration of sexual identity and the family has inspired creative practices and the expression of identity throughout Greece. Papanikolaou’s expertise and interventions in the public sphere have contributed to a more socially progressive culture and highlighted the political implications of cultural texts to policymakers, educators, cultural practitioners, and social and health professionals. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Discussion of gender, sexuality and queer theory has gathered pace in Greece over the past decade, especially in the fields of anthropology and history. Papanikolaou's work has pioneered this discussion in the study of Greek literature and culture. His research maps Greek queer culture and underlines the need to collect archival material that documents its subcultural, historical and contemporary value for a reconsideration of Greek national identity and citizenship **\[R1, R2, R3\]** His more recent research reframes the rise of gender violence, sexism and homophobia in the context of the socioeconomic and political crisis that struck Greece after 2008 **\[R4\]**. 

 Papanikolaou’s monograph **\[R5\]**, ‘ *Made just like me’:* *Queer Cavafy and the poetics of sexuality* \(2014\) offers an analysis of major Greek poet C. P. Cavafy, informed by queer theory and the history of sexuality. Supported by historical analysis and close reading, it argues for the inclusion of Cavafy in a modern canon of queer literature, underlines the educational, cultural and social benefits of such a move, and critiques past Greek attitudes against even the idea of such an inclusion. Papanikolaou’s more recent work on the poet points out the importance of Cavafy for an international queer political movement and the empowering insights his poems can provide into issues of ethics, citizenship and belonging **\[R2\]**. 

 Papanikolaou’s second monograph **\[R6\]**, *There is something about the Family: Nation, desire and kinship at a time of crisis* \(2018\), tracks the recurrence of the themes of kinship and family violence in Greek cultural texts since 2008, during ‘the Greek Crisis’. Papanikolaou argues that a radical political critique of Greek society lies behind the recent turn towards alternative ‘family stories’ evident in Greek cinema, literature and the arts. Introducing a queer theoretical angle to this identifiable cultural trend, he shows the political dimension of its underlying themes, but also the new historicizing force that resulted from it. This is what Papanikolaou calls ‘archive trouble’, a coinage that has already become common in Greek studies.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Papanikolaou’s research and public interventions on gender and sexual identity in Greece form part of an ongoing project which advocates an alternative cultural canon and proposes new ways to integrate literature and culture into debates on social justice, equal rights and a more democratic public sphere. 

 **Reframed the literary and cultural canon** 

 Papanikolaou’s book on Cavafy **\[R5\]** and its call for a new critical agenda was enthusiastically embraced by a younger generation of thinkers, educators, activists and cultural practitioners **\[S1.iv, S4\]**. Having provoked substantial media coverage and a heated debate **\[S1.v\]**, it was praised for “contributing to a timely and politically significant dialogue on the relationship between knowledge / power and sexuality” **\[S1.i\]**. Nikos Vatopoulos, influential Greek journalist and cultural commentator, observed that “one can no longer return to Cavafy’s poetry without taking into account Papanikolaou’s \[…\] complex, ‘political’, and dynamic reading” **\[S1.iii\]**. An artist and educator commented that “the fact that there exists an academic work to support and ceremoniously unveil all those things hidden for years is very important for us artists and educators, as it allows us to take up and continue this work” **\[S6\]**. Among many events organised on issues raised by the book are two on Cavafy and sexuality at the Onassis Cultural Centre \(2014/2015\) **\[S3.iii\]** which attracted 700\+ audience members and over 14,000 online views, and book presentations \(Athens, Thessaloniki, London, Oxford\). Following this, Papanikolaou was invited to organize a very successful series of ‘public lessons on Cavafy’ \(2016, Onassis Cultural Centre; 2017, Onassis Foundation\), aimed at the general public. 

 **Inspired creative practice and the expression of identity** 

 Cultural practitioners have been inspired by Papanikolaou’s work on gender, kinship, sexuality and the public sphere. As a writer, educator and theatre practitioner stated, “it brings new openings for political and historical engagement” **\[S7.i\]**. 

 Another theatre director remarked: “\[Papanikolaou’s work\] has helped me realize more generally my role as an artist who participates in a wider wave of contestation against Greek society’s established beliefs, and more specifically to rethink the ways in which a work of art can reach out to its audience” **\[S7.ii\]**. In April 2019, a group led by theatre educator and practitioner Anna Tzakou presented a site\-specific performance framed as a comment on Papanikolaou’s *There is Something About the Family* **\[R6; S8\]** A performer commented: “\[Papanikolaou’s work\] introduced me to a new way of approaching cultural events \[…\]; it offered me a new way of understanding and opening a dialogue with the other. The \[book's\] concept of ‘archive trouble’ liberated me, giving the necessary distance so that I could endure very difficult emotions” **\[S8.iii\]**. 

 The Thessaloniki International Book Fair \(2019\) commissioned the performance *However I*, with four poets sharing work in direct dialogue with Papanikolaou’s book. The convener stated: “When I commissioned this event, I could not imagine either how powerful the artistic synergy it provoked would be, or that the audience would end up being so large, with dozens of people standing up when the 100 seats of the room filled up” **\[S3.ii\]**. Audience members questioned about their attendance indicated the importance and relevance of Papanikolaou’s book for crucial debates in contemporary Greek society. “It is rare for an academic book to have such a wide readership”, said one. Another called the performance “breath\-taking”, underlining performers’ and audience’s deep affective reaction to the text. On a scale from 1 to 5, respondents strongly agreed \(average: 4.9\), that “the event contributed to the establishment of a more progressive culture in Greece regarding gender and sexuality” **\[S3.i\]**. 

 Reviewers commended the social importance and wide reach of Papanikolaou’s most recent book: ‘Judging from the sheer number and quality of reviews and by the general interest that the book provoked \[…\] it is obvious that it clearly rocked the boat and very diverse audiences responded to it. \[…\] this is the right book at the right time’ **\[S2.i\].** The book was repeatedly profiled in the media, including interviews with the author and an hour\-long programme of excerpts on national radio **\[S2.iii\]**. 

 In 2019, the Athens Film Archive invited Papanikolaou to curate a programme of public screenings of the films discussed in *There is Something About the Family* **\[R6\]**; the programme took over the title for ten public screenings and discussions \(attendance >1,000\), with its catalogue read in its print and electronic versions over 10,000 times **\[S9.i & ii\]**. Considerable ensuing media interest focused on how Papanikolaou’s work facilitates an understanding of new trends in Greek society **\[S9.iii & iv\]**. 

 **Stimulated debate in the public sphere and made a substantial contribution to socially progressive culture.** 

 Papanikolaou's 40\+ newspaper articles within the census period on current events and campaigns for social change were read on average 40,000 times in print/online, republished widely, shared and commented on by audiences ranging from interested citizens to educators and politicians: “he frames and shows the real dimensions of these issues magnificently” \(Facebook comment\) **\[S4\]**. 

 In the parliamentary debate on the new partnership bill that recognised same gender couples for the first time \(22 December 2015\), an MP quoted Papanikolaou on the social implications **\[S5.i\-iii\]**, while the then Minister of Education started her speech arguing that addressing Cavafy's sexuality can change social attitudes, using terms proposed by Papanikolaou **\[S5.i, R5\]**. As she affirmed, Papanikolaou’s writings reached a very large audience “alerting them to the existence of systemic racism, homophobia and gender violence in Greek society. It is no understatement to say that I and many other colleagues have been influenced and inspired by his work” **\[S5.iv\]**. 

 Papanikolaou’s public talks have been attended by 5,000\+ people, and viewed over 55,000 times online **\[S3.iii\-iv\]**. Invitations to speak at activist collectives and NGOs \(Beaver, Kiouria, Positive Voice, Diotima\) showed a similar reach. Responses highlighted these events as constituting a “very valuable encounter, a form of sharing and exchange” and a “way of ‘empowerment’, expanding on academic claims and questions, but also reaching out beyond academia” **\[S10.i\]**. 

 Papanikolaou’s work contributes to community regeneration and development. Since 2019, he has worked closely with Positive Voice, the Association of People Living with HIV in Greece, to create a participatory ‘Public Archive of HIV/AIDS in Greece’. The partnership resulted in well\-attended public meetings and seminars aimed at activists and volunteers on HIV/AIDS representations, memory and public archiving **\[S10.ii\]**. The president of the Association described how Papanikolaou’s work “made us rethink our attitude towards our own archive and public history”, while events organised with his support “have given us new energy to review the history of HIV/AIDS in Greece and to address the stigma that still exists in Greek society” **\[S10.iii\]**.In May/July 2020, Papanikolaou was invited by feminist NGO Diotima to offer a seminar on “Archives, gender and displacement” aimed at staff working with migrants/refugees in Athens and Moria, Lesvos. In their feedback, they deemed it “absolutely necessary for our work and completely mind\-blowing”, adding that “it gave us a boost and offered new ways to think our own archival practices” **\[S10.iv\]**. 

 In 2019/2020, in collaboration with Athena Athanasiou and with support from Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung/Athens, Papanikolaou organized the public engagement project *Queer Politics/ Public Memory* with capacity audiences at all meetings \(150\+\) and over 20,000 online views *.* It “attracted considerable and very positive mentions in the electronic and print press as well as on the radio” **\[S10\]** and culminated with the publication of an opensource electronic and print book, *Queer Politics / Public Memory* \(ed. Papanikolaou et al\). As the Director of Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung/Athens stated, “these events successfully continued the debate on homophobia, gender violence and necropolitics in the Greek public sphere, reaching as many people as possible and engaging non\-specialist audiences in the broadest possible way”. The book was downloaded and/or read online “by more than 10,000 people in its first weeks of publication” **\[S10.v\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cultivating synergies between the physical and life sciences is at the heart of Imperial College’s \(IC’s\) interdisciplinary Institute of Chemical Biology \(ICB\). Chemistry research originating at the ICB in collaboration with other scientists and clinicians at IC and elsewhere has led to a pipeline of innovative corporate ventures in drug discovery, diagnostics and personal care. Recent highlights include the IC spinout Myricx Pharma, which is driving new therapeutic approaches for refractory cancers and has attracted over £4.5 million in seed funding; Vidya Health, which is developing at\-home diagnostic devices, with a prototype currently in patient trials and around \*\*\*\* in seed funding; and BioMin, a now trading company disrupting the global consumer dental health market – currently valued at \*\*\*\* with an annual turnover of           and sales/ licensing across Europe, China, USA, India and Australia.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For 15 years, the Institute of Chemical Biology \(ICB\) at IC has pioneered and led research, innovation and education at the interface of the physical, life and medical sciences. Its mission is to develop novel tools and techniques to solve pressing challenges in biomedical science. Research themes cover the spectrum of healthcare, and include **drug discovery, diagnostics and personal care**. A major priority for the ICB is training of the next generation of scientists and innovators who are well versed in both physical and life sciences – which is delivered through Centres for Doctoral Training \(CDTs\). Highlighted below are three multidisciplinary research projects – all involving academic staff and postgraduates in Chemistry, Physics, and Life Sciences at IC and medical departments including the National Heart and Lung Institute, the Centre for Experimental Medicine \(Belfast\), the Institute of Cancer Research, the Royal Marsden Hospital and Dental Physical Sciences at Barts – that have ultimately underpinned promising and successful biotech ventures \(detailed further in Section 4\). 

 A major research theme of the ICB is **drug discovery**, and **Professor Edward Tate** leads a group focused on the design and application of chemical approaches to understand and modulate living systems, with an emphasis on controlling processes important to the progression of diseases. Over several years, the team has investigated the action of human *N*\-myristoyltransferase \(NMT\) 1 and 2, which catalyse *N*\-terminal protein myristoylation. This derivatisation plays vital roles in modulating protein\-protein interactions, targeting proteins to cytoplasmic and plasma membranes, and regulating cellular signalling pathways in several biological processes. In 2018, the group discovered a potent and selective inhibitor of human NMT\- 1 and 2, which was found to block capsid assembly and replication of the common cold virus **\[1\]**. NMT has also been proposed as a target in cancer. Most recently the group undertook a large\-scale screening of cancer cell lines against a panel of NMT inhibitors, combined with a systems\-level analysis of cellular response. This revealed that deregulation of MYC or MYCN renders cancer cells acutely sensitive to NMT inhibition **\[2\]**. This has formed the basis of IC spinout and funding of the company **Myricx Pharma**. 

 Another key pillar of research at the ICB is **healthcare diagnostics.** Working in this area is **Professor David Klug**, a co\-founder of the ICB who chaired the Single Cell Proteomics Project, a £5 million multidisciplinary collaboration developing novel platform technologies for high throughput analysis. His group’s recent work was focused on single molecule\-sensitive affinity assays for the analysis of single and rare human primary cells in a variety of contexts. These methods were based on microfluidics, with optical trap cell handling and incorporating single molecule detection **\[3\]**. For example, the group has used a microfluidic antibody capture \(MAC\) chip to measure the expression of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and of its post\-translationally modified form phosphorylated at serine\-15 **\[4\]**. This work ultimately demonstrated a practicable workflow for single cell proteomics in clinically relevant samples and thus a potential translational route for single cell proteomics into medical diagnostics. The knowledge and experience developed during this research has led to the formation and funding of Vidya Health. 

 The **personal care sector** is of significant economic importance, with links to healthcare, and is a research focus for the ICB. **Professor Robert Law**, Professor of Biological Materials in the ICB, leads projects in this area. He specialises in materials chemistry, particularly the use of solid\-state nuclear magnetic resonance \(NMR\) spectroscopy. Professor Law and team have used these techniques in the field of dental science, specifically in designing and characterising the behaviour of a novel toothpaste additive: fluoro\-calcium\-sodium phosphosilicate. This material rapidly dissolves during teeth brushing and directly crystallises to fluorapatite \(FAP\), Ca<sub>5</sub>\(PO<sub>4</sub>\)<sub>3</sub>F, covering the tooth surface and thereby enhancing its resistance towards acid erosion **\[5,6\]**. Using Magic Angle Spinning \(MAS\) NMR, Professor Law and team were able to model and elucidate the mechanisms of the dissolution processes involved in the formation of FAP. This was critical in designing a formulation which released the correct ratios of ions to allow the direct precipitation of the FAP onto the tooth surface **\[6\]**. This research was key to the formation and funding of the now trading and profitable **BioMin Technologies Ltd.**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since its formation in 2005, the Institute of Chemical Biology in the Department of Chemistry has had considerable influence on the chemistry\-facing multidisciplinary landscape at IC and beyond. Its success in forging links between physical and life scientists, as well as with engineers and clinicians, underpinned the approach and design of the £167 million Chemistry\-led Molecular Sciences Research Hub \(MSRH\) at IC’s White City Campus, which opened in October 2019 **\[A\]**. Representing the largest investment in a university building in 21st century London, the MSRH is designed to break down traditional barriers between chemistry, other physical sciences, biological sciences and medical disciplines: it brings together the collective expertise of more than 800 scientists, clinicians, engineers and corporate business partners. 

 Allied to this major multidisciplinary initiative, the ICB has long placed considerable emphasis on translation, drawing in commercial and clinical partners – an approach which also underpinned the wider innovation initiatives at the IC White City campus. This ecosystem now includes space and specialist facilities for ideation and business development at every stage – from prototyping facilities at the Chemistry\-led IC Advanced Hackspace, to laboratories and offices for early\-stage start\-ups at the IC White City Incubator, as well as greater scope for fast growing companies at the Scale Space facility **\[A\]**. This ecosystem has also proved attractive for multinationals, for example with the pharmaceutical giant Norvartis locating its European HQ to White City in 2020 **\[A\]** along with L’Oréal, the world’s largest cosmetics company **\[A\]**. 

 Highlighted below are three recent ventures, that have respectively resulted from research in drug discovery, healthcare diagnostics and on personal care products at the ICB \(detailed in Section 2\). 

###  New therapeutic approaches to cancer: Myricx 

 The MYC family oncogene is deregulated in over half of all human cancers and is frequently associated with poor prognosis and patient survival. Indeed, MYC has a central role in almost every aspect of the oncogenic process, orchestrating proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism. However, direct targeting of MYC has been a challenge for decades owing to its supposed ‘undruggable’ protein structure. Yet, recent work from the laboratory of Professor Ed Tate in Chemistry has shown *N*\-myristoyltransferase \(NMT\) inhibition, with a potent and selective small molecule, is lethal to MYC\-deregulated cancer cells. This mechanistic framework supports NMT inhibition as a novel targeted therapeutic approach and led to the formation of small molecule drug discovery company Myricx Pharma, with Professor Tate as Chief Scientific Officer \(CSO\) and Dr Roberto Solari, from the National Heart & Lung Institute at IC as Chief Executive Officer \(CEO\). The Company raised an initial £4.5million in seed investment from Sofinnova Partners and Brandon Capital Partners in 2020 **\[B\]** \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*                                                                                                              **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*        \*\*\*\*\*\*                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The initial focus is the development of novel NMT inhibitors for oncology xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                     x. The Myricx collaborative team has also been actively studying the role that NMT plays in viral pathogens, with a view to developing anti\-viral therapies.

###  Next generation diagnostics: Vidya Health 

 The consumer health monitoring market has gained traction recently, with companies offering at\-home postal blood testing services. A closed\-loop saliva test would be far more attractive prospect, allowing longitudinal testing at different times of day. Professor David Klug is the Chief Scientific Officer of Vidya Health – a company developing technology for saliva testing at home, at the point of care and in retail outlets, underpinned by Chemistry research in the ICB at IC. Vidya has raised a cumulative total of around \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* in investment to date from a syndicate of investors **\[C\]**. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Vidya recently took part in a trial of its technology supported by Innovate UK and in collaboration with UCL, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Royal Free Hospital and UCLH aimed at detecting coronavirus antibodies in around 300 healthcare workers **\[D\]**. This is helping to address specific questions around immune function. Future trials in other clinical areas are planned, with the ultimate aim being early detection of a range of conditions including but not limited to cancers, liver and kidney conditions, diabetes, pregnancy related conditions, cardiovascular and inflammatory and infectious conditions **\[E\]**.

###  Consumer dental health: BioMin Technology 

  

 Virtually all toothpastes currently on the market rely on very old technology from the 1930s. Essentially the presence of fluoride, F<sup>\-</sup>, inhibits the reaction between food and drink\-derived acid \(e.g. citric, maleic, tartaric, lactic, phosphoric acid\) and the alkaline \(OH<sup>\-</sup>\) tooth surface. Over a number of years, ICB Professor Robert Law developed a novel toothpaste additive that rapidly dissolves during teeth brushing and directly crystallises to cover the tooth surface to resist acid erosion and enable remineralisation of enamel. In addition, this precipitation allows suppression of hypersensitivity at the gum\-tooth join through the occlusion of dentinal tubules. This technology platform led to the creation and funding of BioMin Technologies Ltd. in 2013 \(biomin.co.uk\). Several independent dental clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of the additive against dental tooth decay and hypersensitivity \(e.g. **\[F\]**\). The company began production and online sales of its proprietary toothpaste in 2018, through Amazon **\[G\]**. Currently the company is valued at xxxxxxxxxx and has a turnover of xxxxxxxx, which includes direct sales and licensing **\[H\]**. Indeed, the active ingredient of the toothpaste has been sold under license to other toothpaste manufacturers around the world including those in China \(Guangdong Kanwan Cosmetics Corp.\), India \(Group Pharmaceuticals Ltd. \(Elsenz\)\), USA \(Dr.Collins, Inc.\), Australia \(BioMin Technologies Ltd.\) and Europe \(BioMin Technologies Ltd.\). Uniquely in the USA, BioMin Technologies Ltd possesses a considerable market advantage in producing only remineralising toothpaste product available that contains a single active component and therefore compliant with FDA regulations for medical devices **\[I\]**. Through this global expansion, the company aims to reduce the economic and healthcare burden associated with dental diseases.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Reflecting the growing acknowledgement of the political significance of cultural diversity, public policy interventions that seek to revitalise the prospects of regional or minority languages have become an increasingly prominent feature of the governance programmes of sub\-state governments in many parts of the world. Research at Aberystwyth’s Department of International Politics has demonstrated that in order to improve the effectiveness of such official revitalisation efforts, the policy interventions of sub\-state governments should take account of a series of contemporary social and political changes related to social interaction, identity and mobility of populations. The research findings have been disseminated widely among public officials and stakeholders associated with the ongoing policy efforts to promote the Welsh language in Wales. The findings have significantly informed the preparation and implementation of *Cymraeg 2050*, the Welsh Government’s national language strategy launched in July 2017.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research at the Department of International Politics at Aberystwyth contributes to the interdisciplinary field of language policy research from a political science perspective. Drawing on expertise in areas such as multi\-level governance, sub\-state politics and policy analysis, recent research has employed comparative and content analysis methods in order to analyse and evaluate public policy interventions by sub\-state governments in Europe and North America that are aimed at revitalising the prospects of regional or minority languages. Since 2016, this research has received further impetus through its association with the university’s interdisciplinary Centre for Welsh Politics and Society. 

 The research consists of two related strands that fall within the overarching theme of language revitalisation and social and political change. 

 In the first strand, Lewis and Royles \[3.1\] benefitting from AHRC grant ‘Language Revitalisation and Social Transformation’ \[3.5\] have critically analysed the policy strategies that guide the language revitalisation efforts of European sub\-state governments. The main findings arising from this research include: 

-  That the language revitalisation strategies of sub\-state governments need to strike a balance between the challenge of increasing the absolute number of minority language speakers and increasing practical societal use of the language. 

-  That official language revitalisation strategies need to take greater account of the implications of social and political changes such as the increase in levels of personal mobility, the rise in networked forms of social interaction and the decline in significance of local and territorially based communities. 

-  That, in response to the growth in personal mobility and changing nature of community, there is scope for official language revitalisation strategies to place more of an emphasis on regional level initiatives, alongside more familiar national and local\-level initiatives. 

 The second research strand undertaken by Edwards \[3.2; 3.3; 3.4\] focuses on migration as a particular form of contemporary social and political change that needs to be incorporated into language revitalisation strategies. Based on research across three international cases \(Catalonia, Quebec and New Brunswick\), the main findings arising from this research include: 

-  That the actions of immigrant families are vital in reinforcing language\-in\-education policies, even where families are not fluent in the minority language. 

-  That that current speakers of regional and minority languages are central to efforts to ensure the linguistic integration of immigrants, and that their participation in language education projects can promote better social cohesion and intergroup relations. 

-  That language revitalisation strategies of sub\-state governments should therefore promote response to immigration that is based on partnership between in\-migrants and current speakers of the minority language, as exemplified by the *Voluntariat per la Llengua* programme in Catalonia. 

 This research has been communicated to beneficiaries in Wales and the UK through engagement with policy networks, co\-operation with public bodies and through a series of events and policy papers \[3.6; 3.7; 3.8\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Based on their research, Lewis, Royles and Edwards were well placed to inform the policy discussion that fed into the preparation of the *Cymraeg 2050* strategy and, as such, to influence key aspects of the strategy document itself as well as aspects of its implementation. 

 The impact was generated through close engagement with officials from the Welsh Government’s Welsh Language Division, running from the initial discussion phase \(between October 2015 and July 2016\), through the public consultation \(between August and October 2016\) and into the final drafting period \(January to July 2017\). During this period Lewis, Royles and Edwards delivered two days of CPD training to twenty\-three officials from the Welsh Language Division \(11 to 12 February 2016\); prepared three briefing papers for staff from the Welsh Language Division that highlighted key findings arising from earlier research \(September 2016, October 2016, April 2017\); hosted a closed research briefing seminar in Cardiff for five members of the Welsh Language Division \(19 October 2016\); prepared a detailed submission to the official public consultation exercise \(October 2016\); and attended three meetings with officials from the Welsh Language Division responsible for drafting strategy \(17 March 2016, 31 January 2017, 4 May 2017\). 

 A Senior Policy Officer from the Welsh Government’s Welsh Language Division, and one of the authors of the final strategy, testifies to the importance of this engagement: 

 Officials from the Welsh Language Division had regular contact with Elin, Huw and Catrin during the process of developing the Cymraeg 2050 strategy, and this included meetings and conversations, a seminar that they organised during the consultation period and also workshops at the National Eisteddfod. We benefited greatly from these discussions and they gave us food for thought as we developed and refined the policy. \[5.1\] 

 Eluned Morgan AM, Minister for International Relations and the Welsh Language, also publicly acknowledged the contribution of Lewis, Royles and Edwards to the work of developing the *Cymraeg 2050* strategy in a speech delivered in Aberystwyth on 10 May 2019 \[5.2\]. 

 Representatives from key stakeholder organisations also confirmed that this activity helped to shape their responses to the draft version of the strategy. For example, a Research Officer from the Office of the Welsh Language Commissioner confirmed that one of the briefing papers informed their written response to the consultation exercise \[5.3\]. In addition, the coordinator of Language Planners Wales \(LPW\), an umbrella organisation representing individuals working in the field of language policy throughout Wales, confirmed that input from Lewis and Royles helped to shape LPW’s response to the draft strategy \[5.4\]. 

 Upon publication in July 2017, the final draft of *Cymraeg 2050* incorporated input by Lewis, Royles and Edwards in four areas: 

 **1\) Structure of strategy:** The final draft was substantially restructured and its main sections \(previously called ‘development areas’, but now called ‘strategic themes’\) had been reworked to align better with the twin challenges of increasing the number of Welsh speakers and increasing use of the language. This was in line with the advice offered by Lewis, Royles and Edwards during the consultation period, and their influence is evident in the summary of evidence document published by the Welsh Government at the end of its public consultation exercise. When acknowledging the need to rethink elements of the strategy’s structure and the nature of its main ‘development areas’, this document quotes directly from the paper submitted to the public consultation by Lewis, Royles and Edwards \[5.5\]. 

 **2\) Reflection on the implications of social and political change:** A new section, ‘Principles and Conceptual Grounding’, was included that argues that ‘language planning and policy methods’ need ‘to reflect the social, economic and political changes that characterise contemporary Wales’, and that the strategy therefore requires ‘an understanding of how speakers use and engage with language today, as well as consideration of how they are likely to do so in the future’. This reflected advice provided by Lewis, Royles and Edwards during the consultation period regarding the need for language revitalisation strategy documents to take greater account of the implications of important social and political changes. Passages on pages 14, 15 and 16 of the strategy are extremely close in terms of wording to points made in material shared with civil servants by Lewis and Royles and Edwards \[5.6\]. 

 **3\) Regional level planning:** The final draft of *Cymraeg 2050* included a new section that discussed the need for a stronger regional focus for language planning initiatives aimed at promoting the Welsh language. The strategy acknowledged that the Government is already ‘planning on a national level and targeting specific local areas’ but then went on to argue that ‘there is scope to plan linguistically at the regional level’ as well. This was in line with recommendation included in a briefing paper by Lewis and Royles shared with civil servants in October 2016 \[5.7\]. 

 **4\) Responding to immigration:** The final draft of *Cymraeg 2050* included a new section entitled ‘Welcoming and integrating people who move into Wales’. This included passages that stressed the importance of developing a partnership between in\-migrants and fluent Welsh speakers. This was in line with the advice offered by Lewis, Royles and Edwards during the public consultation period. Of particular note is a passage that specifically mentions the *Voluntariat per la Llengua* programme identified by Edwards as an example of international good practice during the briefing seminar for officials of the Welsh Language Division held on 19 October 2016, and which she discussed informally with the civil servants working on the strategy between June 2016 and June 2017 \[5.8\]. 

 Later developments point to how impact by Lewis, Royles and Edwards on the conceptual grounding of *Cymraeg 2050* also influenced how Welsh Government officials have approached the process of implementing the strategy, specifically the task of developing policy interventions aimed at achieving some of its key targets. 

 **5\) Implementation of Cymraeg 2050:** A research commissioning document published by the Welsh Government on August 2019 inviting tenders to conduct a review of its GBP4,300,000 grant scheme for promoting and facilitating the social use of Welsh specified that such a scheme needs to be responsive to contemporary social changes \(e.g., information technology, personal mobility, new forms of community\) \[5.9\], quoting two passages from the *Cymraeg 2050* strategy that stress the implications of contemporary social and political changes for language use habits – the same passages that were originally influenced by advice given to civil servants by Lewis, Royles and Edwards. 

 As the significance of language policy questions for Welsh political actors and policy makers continues to increase in the context of Wales’ broader development as a devolved political community, Lewis, Royles and Edwards have continued to inform the work of various governmental and non\-governmental bodies in Wales. Recent examples include: 

-  Welsh Government: policy briefing reports, authored by Lewis and Royles were cited in two recent Welsh Government publications \[5.10\]. 

-  Welsh Parliament, Culture Welsh Language and Communications Committee **:** evidence submitted to its 2018 \- 2019 inquiry, ‘Supporting and Promoting the Welsh Language’, was cited several times in the final report published July 2019 \[5.11\]. 

-  The Welsh Language Commissioner: a research briefing session held with the new Commissioner 16 May 2019, and a subsequent session arranged with staff from the office’s research and policy team on 3 February 2020 to inform their work on the Commissioner’s next five\-year report on the position of the Welsh language.

demonstrated the importance of language and linguistics to teaching and learning in diverse communities. Public engagement in teaching, preservation, recovery, and exploration of language and linguistics has helped communities to reclaim heritage and broaden horizons in an increasingly globalised world. Developmental teaching approaches underpinned by UK University research in partnership with various international institutions has placed language-learning at the heart of education. Emphasis on supporting multilingual communities in safeguarding and sharing their linguistic heritage has helped to strength local communities and aid the integration of refugee and other vulnerable minority groups. Impact in this topic has focused on developing language teaching tools which can be used in a range of contexts, whether it be aiding in second language teaching for students with SpLDs or creating international teaching partnerships to enable language mentoring. Case studies in this strand often participate in the preservation and recovery of native languages, particularly Gaelic. Welsh-language learning tools, often capitalising on the opportunity for crowdsourcing knowledge online, have made impressive strides in boosting public interest in Welsh learning.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Museums need innovative ways to improve visitor experience while protecting cultural heritage. Research at Loughborough University developed new approaches for 3D scanning and 3D printing of cultural artefacts and provided a new methodological approach for artefact restoration and replication. Cultural heritage partners \(including Forbidden City, Beijing; Manchester Museum; Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow; World Museum, Liverpool; Museum of Wigan Life\) used this knowledge during major replication and restoration projects, with the following impacts: 1\) **Two economic benefits** –  a\) established a new artefact restoration and replication company with £290k annual turnover, and b\) reduced the cost and time needed for artefact restoration at four organisations; and 2\) **increased public engagement and improved visitor experience at two major exhibitions**. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Early museums provided a sensory experience where visitors could hold and interact with displayed objects. In the nineteenth century, a shift towards conservation concerns contributed to the move away from physical interaction. Recent decades have seen a shift back towards interactive exhibits, requiring museums to manage the difficult balance between protecting artefacts and improving visitor experience. Push\-button displays provide a degree of hands\-on interaction but with increasing technology available within homes \(e.g., games consoles\) the novelty of this experience is becoming limited. Museums need to fully exploit the benefits of innovative digital design technologies to improve the preservation, exhibition, and replication of rare, valuable, and fragile artefacts. 

 This research programme, conducted by Campbell, Bibb, Graham and Paterson, aimed to determine how 3D scanning and 3D printing technologies could be used to maximum benefit in the heritage sector. The research identified the different combinations of techniques most appropriate to individual artefacts to assist in their replication or restoration, requiring consideration of accuracy, timescales, and costs. This was achieved through research projects examining how artefacts with a wide range of materials, sizes and required accuracy should be processed. The research also applied these digital tools to visualisation and representation of human anatomy in the medical field **\[R1\]**. 

 The research involved 3D scanning and physical reproduction of cultural artefacts. Eleven projects involved Chinese partners: six projects with the Director of Restoration, Palace Museum \(2009 – 2019\); two projects with the Director of Research, Summer Palace Museum \(2012 – 2015 & 2019 \- present\); two projects with the Director of Management, Garden Museum \(2013 – 2015\); one project with the Director of Exhibition Design, Palace Museum \(2018 \- present\). The accuracy, cost and timing data generated through these projects was used to develop a new methodological approach for accurate and efficient replication and restoration of artefacts **\[R2\], \[R3\]**. The twelfth project involved collaboration with archaeologists at the University of Manchester \(2014 – 2020\), Prof Andrew Chamberlain, Professor of Bioarchaeology, and Dr Lidija McKnight, Research Fellow, Dept of Earth and Environmental Sciences. The 3D printing and scanning research at Loughborough focused on developing techniques for the visualisation and physical reproduction of anatomy and artefacts from within mummified animals. This involved the isolation of bone anatomy data to facilitate definitive species identification. Computer\-aided visualisation techniques were developed to help visitors better understand the contents of mummies. Physical items were produced to enable handling and physical interpretation by museum staff and visitors, with special attention paid to visually impaired visitors **\[R4\], \[R5\]**. 

 Overall, the research generated new knowledge on how to better 3D scan ancient, mummified objects and manipulate 3D scan data in preparation for 3D printing, optimising the effectiveness of 3D scanning and 3D printing in mummified animal species identification, and developing a new methodological approach for artefact restoration and replication.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Close collaboration with many of the museums was embedded within the underpinning research, creating an immediate pathway for the two key impacts: 

 **Impact 1: New economic activity in cultural heritage restoration and replication.** 

 <ins>a\)</ins> <ins>New</ins> <ins>artefact</ins> <ins>restoration</ins> <ins>and replication</ins> <ins>compan</ins><ins>y</ins> <ins>established</ins> <ins>in China</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 A new private company was established in China in 2014 to provide the expertise generated through our research to museums and other organisations, on a commercial basis. Nanjing Shuwei Cultural Creative Co. Ltd. has one full\-time employee and had a 2019 turnover of approximately £290k **\[S1\]**. 

 <ins>b\) The cost and speed of artefact restoration and replication was reduced while artefact quality was improved</ins> <ins>at three</ins> <ins>museums in China and the UK</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>at</ins> <ins>a theme park in China</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 The techniques discovered in our research **\[R2, R3\]** have been adopted by leading museums in China \(in collaboration with Nanjing Shuwei Cultural Creative Co. Ltd\) and the UK. The Palace Museum in Beijing \(aka the Forbidden City\) is the most visited museum in the world, with approximately 19 million visitors in 2019. In 2019, 3D\-printed replicas of an ancient vase and plant were displayed in a special exhibition. 3D\-printed cloisonné replicas were displayed in the Forbidden City when the Qianlong Garden opened to the public in 2020. The Director of Restoration, Ancient Architecture Department, Palace Museum, stated: 

 *“The partnership … has enabled the Palace Museum to achieve many more of its restoration targets than would otherwise have been possible. It is estimated the overall time saving over a five\-year period has been in the region of 1,800 hours”* **\[S2\]**. 

 Full\-size replicas of the two guardian lions from the entrance to the Summer Palace are now displayed at the entrance to the new Garden Museum in Beijing \(see Figure 1\). The techniques used to produce the bronze and marble replicas outperformed conventional processes, which had failed to replicate the undercuts on fine detailed relief sculpture. 

 
 
 

 *Figure 1: Replica guardian lion at the entrance to the Garden Museum \(left\) and the original lion at the entrance to the Summer Palace \(right\).* 

 In the UK, 3D scanning of hidden artefacts wrapped within Egyptian animal mummies was completed for the Manchester Museum. The data was used to produce 3D\-printed replicas of the previously unseen artefacts. The Curator of Egypt and Sudan at the Manchester Museum states: 

 *“… the use of 3D prints in these contexts have been really transformative… in testing assumptions of what mummies actually contain…”* **\[S3\]**. 

 The replication techniques were also used in non\-museum organisations, e.g., consultancy work for the Aero\-Sun Engineering Art Co. towards building a 76m tall statue of a Chinese empress. This is a central attraction in the Huayi Brothers’ movie theme park in Suzhou, near Shanghai. The theme park attracts around 5 million visitors per year **\[S\]**. 

 **Impact 2: Increased public engagement with, and improved visitor experience at two major exhibitions.** 

 Our research led to an improvement in the quality of museum exhibitions by using 3D scan data to create virtual reality \(VR\) presentations and 3D\-printed replicas **\[R2, R3, R4, R5\]**. 

 At a major exhibition in the Forbidden City, visitors were able to engage in immersive VR experiences and touch the 3D\-printed replica artefacts. Writing about this exhibition, the Director of Design in the Exhibition Department of the Palace Museum stated: 

 *“the partnership … has enabled the Palace Museum to explore new means of introducing digital technology into exhibition spaces”* **\[S5\]**. 

 Another major exhibition, “Gifts for the Gods: Animal Mummies Revealed”, was initially held at Manchester Museum in 2015 and subsequently at the Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow, the World Museum in Liverpool, and the Museum of Wigan Life. At least 300,000 individual visitors saw the original and touring exhibition in person, with over 165,000 people using Manchester’s related social media resource. 3D printing proved successful in demonstrating to visitors the previously hidden artefacts inside the linen wrappings of the animal mummies. Visitor feedback was captured at the first three venues, which showed increased visitor engagement due to the use of science and technology in the study of cultural artefacts. For example, visitors stated: 

 “*A fascinating exhibition, amazing to see the mummified creatures.”* 

 *“It was brilliant to be able to touch the replica artefacts and fascinating to learn about the technology that enabled them to be produced”* **\[S6\]**. 

 As part of the Gifts for the Gods exhibition tour, a range of targeted engagement events were held for the public, including evening ‘Mummy Re\-rollings’, daytime talks, guided tours, and sessions for school visitors \(covering educational Key Stages 1 to 4\). These evolved over time to include handling sessions using the 3D replicas \(see Figure 2, below\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Preston Model \(PM\) is the go\-to reference model for Community Wealth Building \(CWB\). CWB increases local economic investment by changing procurement behaviours through cooperation. The Preston Cooperative Development Network \(PCDN\), of which Manley was the founding Chair, drives these developments. The research has changed the socio\-economic fortunes of Preston. Local procurement has increased during the research period \(2012\-present\) from 39% to 79.2% \(increase of GBP199,688,679\), meaning **“Preston emerged as this year’s top improver” \[D1\]** according to PWC/Demos \[D2\]\). Innovative collaboration between Preston City Council and the PCDN has led to the establishment of four cooperatives, with funding in place for a further six. Innovative use of council property has enabled the establishment of *The Larder* community café cooperative, which has supported struggling communities during the Coronavirus pandemic. Action research continues to impact the long\-term development of the PM, through the creation of a Preston Cooperative Education Centre \(December 2020\) and a cooperative bank registered with the financial conduct authority in 2020.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since the economic crash of 2008, Preston has been faced with a grim economic and social horizon. In this context, the University of Central Lancashire and Preston City Council \(PCC\) created a research\-into\-policy partnership to create new, alternative solutions for the city. This has become known as the ‘Preston Model’. 

 The University of Central Lancashire’s research has directly impacted the Preston Model through the interplay between economic and psychosocial insights into models of economic development, economic democratisation and co\-operative forms of organisation. Whyman’s foundational research \[1\] evaluated the potential for economic democratisation and the operation of community investment funds in Sweden to facilitate regional and national economic development objectives. Insights from this work informed preliminary discussions with PCC \(30/10/2012\), in how this approach can help to anchor value within the local economy. Further work examined the economic potential for co\-operative forms of ownership to realise economic goals \[2\], as explained to Councillors and stakeholders in a public seminar held at the University of Central Lancashire in November 2013. Manley’s on\-going research from 2013 to the present has included five academic seminars and six academic conference presentations, both national and international.  This work has complemented and extended these themes, creating an integrated and transdisciplinary research project leading to the creation of the Preston Model. By combining Whyman’s economics research with Manley’s psychosocial, behavioural and social dynamics research, our research provided PCC with a unique approach to transformative socio\-economic change for Preston. Manley’s research on the effects of a worker\-owned cooperative system has identified the importance of this system in effecting social change, in particular, developing relationships, shaping identities and developing a sense of worth, local pride, citizenship and participatory democracy. Manley’s cooperative research in Mondragón \[4\]  was funded by the Government of the Basque Country and was brought to Preston for further development in 2016. This developing inter\-disciplinary research programme has helped to imbue the Preston Model with its innovative and distinctive combination of economic, social, democratic and participatory objectives. 

 A 2013 symposium brought the Head of External Relations of Mondragón Cooperative Corporation \(MCC\), Mikel Lezamiz to the University of Central Lancashire, and forged the research partnership between PCC, MCC and the university. PCC subsequently funded Manley and Froggett, to conduct research into co\-operative values and principles in Preston. The 2016 Report \[3\] concluded that there was local potential for co\-operative development and listed a set of recommendations for this development to PCC. The Report’s recommendations form the foundation of the Preston Model later developed by PCC. 

 *.* 

 PCC\-funded action research \(2017\) led by Manley was disseminated through public presentations, symposiums, national media reports and presented to senior Labour Party politicians, \(John McDonnell, Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Milliband\). 

 Continuing research incorporates the use of an innovative participatory research method – social dreaming \- that has directly impacted stakeholder communities in Bermuda and cooperatives in Mondragón \[4, 5\]. Manley and Whyman have been funded by the Creative Industries Policy and Evidence Centre \(led by Nesta\) for a further research project that will provide an in\-depth study of the relationship between economic and social capital in the Preston Model. Manley’s and Whyman’s forthcoming publication focuses on the socio\-economic democracy created through CWB and the Preston Model. Manley’s research has recently been funded by the National Institute for Health Research as part of a joint research project to develop research into the public health benefits of the Preston Model. 

 COVID\-19 STATEMENT: Manley and Whyman’s edited volume *The Preston Model and Community Wealth Building: Creating A Socio\-Economic Democracy for the Future.* London: Routledge was scheduled for publication in 2020 but has been delayed to 2021 due to the COVID\-19 pandemic.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins> **Creating and retaining wealth in Preston**</ins> 

 The Preston Model \(PM\) began following Manley’s 2013 research seminar series inviting Mikel Lezamiz of the Mondragon Corporation to talk in Preston about the Mondragón socio\-economic model. Mondragón, \(Basque Country\), is the most successful cooperative business hub in the world. Ibon Zugasti, Territorial Development Manager highlights that: **“Julian Manley has provided invaluable research for the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation in the field of co\-operative culture and values”** demonstrating the impact of Manley’s research \[A3\]. This kick\-started cooperative development in Preston, achieving funding in 2015 leading to Manley’s 2016 recommendations to Preston City Council \(PCC\), and further funding in 2017 for research leading directly to the creation of the legally constituted Preston Cooperative Development Network \(PCDN\) in 2017 \[B\]. Further research led to significant funding from the Open Society Foundations in 2019 to create 10 worker\-owned cooperatives, of which four created to date. This funding also secured the founding of the Preston Cooperative Education Centre in 2020 and a community bank, North West Mutual was approved by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2020. 

 The Leader of Preston City Council, Matthew Brown, widely credited with the political leadership of the PM, acknowledges that Manley’s “ **2016 research report … concluded with a series of recommendations that … have formed the basis for cooperative development in Preston  … providing an economic boost to the Preston Model project by funding new cooperatives for Preston, as well as training and consultancy services for city stakeholders.”** \[A1\] 

 The 2016 research recommendations \[3\] form the basis of the PM in 2020. Firstly, the creation of the PCDN.  Secondly, the PCC’s alignment of cooperative development with procurement policies.  Thirdly, the introduction of the Mondragón four pillars of socio\-economic development: Finance, Education, Research and Development and Welfare, demonstrated through the creation of the bank and the Education Centre. One significant impact has been a creative approach to the renting out of Council property, for example *The Larder* cooperative that has been located in PCC property. *The Larder* cooperative is an ethical café that contributes profits back into communities in need. Without Manley’s research, *The Larder* would neither have become a cooperative, nor had the premises to provide for the local community. *The Larder* has supported struggling communities during the Coronavirus pandemic and its founder, Kay Johnson, has been recognised with the awarding of an MBE in 2020. Finally, establishing national and regional links, for example with the Labour Party’s Community Wealth Building Unit, which lists Manley’s report as fundamental to the development of Community Wealth Building nationally for Labour controlled councils: “ **The University of Central Lancashire is one of the key anchor institutions which have been involved in pushing the Community Wealth Building work being undertaken by the Labour\-led Preston City Council.”** \[C\] 

 The impacts emerging from the 2016 report have led to 4000 additional people in Preston now receiving the Real Living Wage as of 2018. A spends analysis shows that the spend from institutions retained within Preston is GBP112,300,000, a rise of GBP74,000,000 from 2012/13, leading to Preston being named the ‘Most Improved City in the United Kingdom’ in in the PWC/DEMOS 2018 report *Good Growth for Cities* 2018 \[D1, D2\]. Public commitment to change has been raised through Manley’s public presentations, \(over 40 by invitation, 2015\-present\), reaching over 2000 changemakers live, and many more thousands online. Manley has helped shape the public understanding of community wealth building and the Preston Model with 15 national newspaper articles, numerous international articles \[E, F\], TV and radio spots, directly leading to the creation of similar models in Hertfordshire, Ayrshire, Bristol, Islington, Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle, and resulting in visits by the national media to Preston. In 2018 both *The Guardian* and the BBC held a media event at the University of Central Lancashire, which was streamed to a wider audience. Manley’s *Conversation* article ‘Preston changed its fortunes with ‘Corbynomics’ – now other cities are doing the same’ published in 2018 has been viewed 18.9k times as of January 2021 \[G\]. Manley also made significant presentations to influential policy\-makers in Parliamentary Committee in Westminster in 2017, and to senior Labour Party figures such as Ed Miliband in Preston and London in 2017, to John McDonnell in Preston 2017 and 2018 and Jeremy Corbyn in London 2019, which helped to shape Labour Party thinking around community wealth building and the role of cooperatives in society. In Scotland, Manley is advising on the Plural Ownership Expert Advisory Group by invitation of Public Health Scotland for the period May 2020\-May 2021, helping to shape future public health policy in Scotland. 

 Through the PM, the University of Central Lancashire has formed a stronger civic partnership with PCC, actively promoting civic engagement to develop co\-operatives from a student base. Before Manley’s research, there was little formal co\-operation of this kind and no co\-operative development. This ongoing work with PCC was recognised with a nomination by the Times Higher Education awards for the award of Outstanding Entrepreneurial University of the Year 2019. Manley’s research is influencing how universities nationwide are developing civic engagement for the future \[H1, H2\]. This is the result of research demonstrating the value of education in cooperative development, as recorded on the PCC website \[I1, I2\]. 

 <ins> **The</ins> <ins>International impact</ins> <ins>of Manley’s development of the Preston Model**</ins> 

 The PM example of cooperative partnership between town and university has extended to Sapporo, Japan, with the visits of a delegation from Hokusei Gakuen University in 2019. Further collaborations with the university in Sapporo were planned for 2020 but were delayed by COVID\-19. The university in Sapporo is seeking alliances with local authorities in the PM style and conversations with Manley are ongoing. These collaborations have been inspired by Manley’s research as published in the Japanese national daily newspaper *Asahi* in 2018 \[J\]. 

 Manley’s research has directly influenced the development of Bermuda’s national economic and social policy, as attested by The Hon. E. David Burt, Premier of Bermuda **: “\[Manley’s\] work … will help to inform the work we do here in Bermuda… Preston is a city that is in the process of re\-imagining itself through self\-empowerment, pride of place, and co\-operative democracy. Its ripple effects are being felt nationally and politically.  Bermuda can benefit from that innovativeness.”** \[A5\]  The Director of Bermuda’s Economic Development Corporation, William Spriggs, regards Manley’s work as **“part of our socio\-economic transformation policy’** and “ **is ‘keenly interested in further developing our partnership with Dr Manley.”**’ \[A4\] 

 In the USA, the 1Worker1Vote network is a network of businesses and organisations inspired by the Preston Model and its example of international partnerships between the likes of PDCN, MCC and the Democracy Collaborative. Through this collaboration, 1Worker1Vote is building a national network of shared ownership, worker\-owned cooperative businesses, helping people to build pathways out of poverty and towards prosperity. According to Michael Peck, Co\-Founder and Executive Director or 1Worker1Vote: “ **Dr. Manley’s research is pioneering how this is unfolding in Preston and soon throughout the United Kingdom.”** \[A2\]  1Worker1Vote organized talks in Washington and Cincinnati where Manley outlined the Preston Model in his keynote to stakeholders, community groups, unions and cooperatives.

Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The thinking and actions of some of the **world’s leading monetary and financial policymakers** have been changed by this research, which **identified a previously\-unknown feature** of the global economic system. 

 First presented in 2013, the finding that **decisions made on US interest rates can alter the flow of investment into and out of countries across the world**, as part of a **global financial cycle**, challenged standard thinking about the relationship between exchange rate regimes, monetary policy and financial stability. It has since **dominated economic and financial discussions** on the world stage. 

 It has “ **influenced our thinking** about the effect of monetary policy in risk taking in international financial markets” says Janet Yellen, former Chair of the **US Federal Reserve** and current **US Treasury Secretary**.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 When the United States sneezes, it is said that the rest of the world catches a cold. That’s usually taken to indicate the outsized global influence of American culture, politics and economic performance. This research identifies a more subtle – but just as significant – knock\-on effect of US actions. It shows that decisions made on US interest rates can alter global financial conditions as measured by spreads, risky asset prices, credit creation and capital flows into and out of countries across the world, as part of a **global financial cycle**. 

 Hélène Rey **first suggested** the idea of a global financial cycle in a paper she presented to the prestigious Jackson Hole Symposium in August 2013 \[3.1\]. 

 **This pioneering idea** was based on Rey’s analysis of how international bond, equity and bank lending flows, risky asset prices and credit growth tend to move together globally, creating a “global financial cycle”. The study showed how the ups and downs of the cycle seem to align with an index called VIX, a traded asset which reflects the expected market volatility over the next month as well as investor sentiment. 

 Next, Rey analysed how this global financial cycle impacted financial conditions within countries, as waves of capital washed in and out. She showed that stock market returns, corporate credit spreads, banking sector leverage growth and house price inflation correlated with changes in the VIX, and so with changes in risk taking and the global financial cycle. This effect of the global financial cycle on national financial conditions happened irrespective of the exchange rate regime \[3.2\]. 

 Finally, the project investigated the cause of fluctuations in the global financial cycle. Rey \[3.3\] analysed monthly data for 1980 – 2010 \(the post crisis sample 2010\-2019 was subsequently studied in \[3.4\]\) using newly developed econometric methods enabling to put in evidence causal links between variables. Rey found that the **monetary policy of the Federal Reserve was an important driver of the global financial cycle**.  A hundred basis points increase in the effective federal funds rate in the US leads to a contemporaneous increase in risk aversion, a decrease in the estimated global factor in risky asset prices \(akin to a 10 percentage points drop in major stock indices\), an appreciation of the US Dollar, a decrease in global domestic credit and in leverage for US and non US banks as well as a fall in capital inflows. 

 Shocks to US monetary policy, in other words, **cause spill\-over effects on the financial conditions of other countries**. This US\-induced tightening in advanced economies and emerging markets alike occurs whether or not countries have a flexible exchange rate. Rey \[3.3\] shows it also takes place in the UK and the Euro area for example. 

 The finding is significant because it **challenges conventional economic wisdom** known as the **Mundellian trilemma**. This states that countries who allow free mobility of capital across their borders, can pursue an independent monetary policy, if and only if they allow the value of their currency to rise and fall relative to others. 

 The impact of a global financial cycle collapses this trilemma into a dilemma: a country cannot have both monetary and financial autonomy and free import and export of capital, even with a flexible exchange rate. Put another way, if a country wishes to set its own monetary and financial conditions, it must **introduce robust macroprudential policies** to **regulate** the financial sector and sometimes it must **restrict international capital** flows \[3.5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research Rey presented in 2013, which **showed for the first time** that the world’s financial system runs as a cycle largely controlled by US monetary policy, was **provocative, widely discussed and has proven to be very influential** at the highest levels. 

 Following the high\-profile launch of her idea \[3.1\], Rey has been invited to give several highly prestigious lectures on this research such as the Mundell Fleming Lecture at the IMF in 2014 \(first woman to give it; 2013 speaker Paul Krugman, 2015 speaker Ben Bernanke\) \[5.1\], the Paolo Baffi lecture at the Banca d’Italia \(first woman\) in 2019 \[5.2\], the Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture at the Bank for International Settlement \(first woman\) in 2017 \[5.3\]. The **IMF constructed its entire 2017 Annual Research Conference** on the concept of the “global financial cycle” that was introduced by Rey’s research \[5.4\]. 

 Backed with solid academic research, Rey’s efforts to discuss and share the findings placed her idea firmly at the top of the global economic agenda. 

 Because many variables combine to inform and steer economic policies, such as the setting of national interest rates, it is difficult to draw a straight line of cause and effect between Rey’s academic research and specific rate setting or macroprudential decisions. As such, the impact of the research is **best indicated by the reach and influence** that the results have had on those who do make such decisions. The research has also helped shape the new integrated policy framework of the International Monetary Fund. 

 For example, **Janet Yellen**, **Chair of the US Federal Reserve** from 2014\-2018, says: 

  

 “Hélène Rey’s research on the global financial cycle and the trilemma **has been important** in informing Federal Open Market Committee discussions especially about the effect of US monetary policy on the rest of the world. It has also **influenced our thinking** about the effect of monetary policy in risk taking in international financial markets.” \[5.5\] 

 “This line of research is interesting and important. Given the sometimes severe consequences of financial instability, **we have to take these issues very seriously**,” says **Ben Bernanke**, also a former US Federal Reserve Chair. \[5.6\] 

 “The presence of borrowers and lenders operating in multiple currencies and in multiple countries creates multiple channels through which developments in financial conditions can be transmitted across countries,” says **Mark Carney**, former governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Financial Stability Board and since 2019, UN special envoy for climate action and finance. 

 “Hélène Rey has been a key proponent of the importance of such channels,” he says. \[5.7\] The research made “an **influential contribution** to the discussions at the **Bank of England**’s Monetary Policy Committee.” \[5.8\] 

 The research “has helped transform **central bank thinking** on the international transmission of monetary policy” says **Benoît Cœuré**, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub and former member of the Executive Board, European Central Bank. \[5.9\] 

 He adds: “Professor Rey’s research on the Mundell trilemma and her concept of a “global financial cycle” have led **central bankers to qualify their traditional views** about monetary policy independence and flexible exchange rates, and have been **very influential**. We **used them at the European Central Bank** to understand the international consequences of our conventional and non\-conventional monetary policy measures. **I have myself referred to Professor Rey’s research** in several public speeches as ECB Executive Board member.“ 

 The research has changed how the IMF operates. **IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath** says: “Professor Rey’s research has been very useful for us. So much so that **her insights have been incorporated in the new analytical Integrated Policy Framework of the Fund**. We highlight in this **new conceptual model the possible role of foreign exchange intervention and capital flow measures to improve monetary autonomy following shocks to international risk appetite**. This is in **accordance with Professor Rey’s** work. This new conceptual framework will, subject to approval from the Board, **be gradually rolled out to help our policy advice** to emerging markets and advanced economies.” \[5.10\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Small molecule, mutation\-specific drugs that are transformative for people with cystic fibrosis \(CF\). These drugs target the underlying cause of disease, substantially improve lung function, reducing hospitalisation to treat pulmonary exacerbations. Their systemic administration also yields extra\-pulmonary effects including digestive, nutritional and metabolic benefits. The first, ivacaftor, demonstrates improved survival and reduced need for lung transplantation. With rapid progression into younger age groups and the development, licensing and commissioning of multi\-molecule combinations, these drugs improve the health and well\-being of the majority \(approximately 85%\) of people with CF. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The cause of CF remained elusive until discovery of the transmembrane conductance regulator \( *CFTR*\) gene in 1989. The resultant understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms in the airways, digestive and reproductive tracts of people with CF \(pwCF\) led to earlier diagnosis and the search for improved treatments, designed to correct the cellular defect at a genetic or protein level. 

 *CFTR* gene mutations impair either the amount of protein produced/reaching the cell surface or CFTR protein function. Most pwCF fall into the first category, possessing either one \(\~40\-50%\) or two \(\~40%\) F508del mutations, resulting in protein misfolding and degradation before reaching the cell surface. ‘Gating’ mutations \(\~5% overall\) produce CFTR that reaches the cell surface but fails to open \(‘gate’\). 

 CFTR modulator drugs, acting in a mutation\-specific fashion have progressed from in vitro studies through to clinical availability: potentiators increase the function of correctly localised protein whereas correctors move misfolded protein up to the cell surface. Professor Jane Davies worked with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, driving a significant clinical trial programme evaluating pipeline drugs: ivacaftor, the first potentiator drug, is highly effective but only suitable for a small proportion of pwCF \(5\-7%, most having gating mutations\); dual combinations tackling F508del with a misfolding corrector and potentiator \(suitable for \~45% pwCF\); triple combinations directed at F508del and containing two misfolding correctors and a potentiator \(suitable for \~85% pwCF\). 

 In 2009 Davies led the UK arm of the pivotal phase 3 trial of ivacaftor in CF patients \(≥12 years\) with a gating mutation. This demonstrated very large improvements in lung function, nutrition and quality of life scores as well as reduced exacerbation frequency \(1\). A subsequent phase 3 trial in 2011, in younger \(6\-11 years\) patients was designed and co\-led globally by Davies and Felix Ratjen, Toronto. It demonstrated that ivacaftor significantly improved pulmonary function, body weight, and CFTR activity compared with placebo, thereby paving the way for early intervention. Since then, Davies has been global co\-lead of all ivacaftor trials in preschool children and infants. For these age groups, conventional assessment of lung function \(measured by spirometry\) was not employed as it lacks sensitivity to early disease and is effort\-dependent making it difficult for children. However, these trials were the first to show nutritional impact, illustrated by the recovery of exocrine paracrine function \(2\). The ivacaftor programme has supported European license extensions \(marketed as Kalydeco\) currently down to 4 months. 

 Efficacy of ivacaftor provided the foundation for multi\-molecule combinations suitable for a much larger proportion of pwCF. The Imperial team trialled dual combinations of lumacaftor or tezacaftor combined with ivacaftor \(3,4; combinations marketed as Orkambi and Symkevi respectively\). Davies was global co\-lead of adult \(4\) and pivotal, phase 3 paediatric \(‘EXPAND’\) trials of tezacaftor/ivacaftor \(5\). Davies was global co\-lead for a phase 2 triple combination study for compound selection \(6\) and conducted phase 3 trials of the selected compound \(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ETI; marketed as Kaftrio\) at Royal Brompton Hospital.  Davies is global lead for current trials of ETI in 6\-11 year old children, and is leading an international trial in the youngest age group to date \(2\-5 year olds\). Many of the paediatric trials have depended on a more sensitive lung function measure than FEV<sub>1</sub>, Lung Clearance Index \(LCI\); she established and leads the European Core Facility standardising this procedure.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cystic fibrosis affects almost 11,000 people in the UK and an estimated 100,000 worldwide, and causes excessive airway mucus secretion, early and recurrent bacterial infection and inflammation leading to irreversible lung damage. Furthermore, the majority \(>85%\) of people experience digestive malfunction leading to poor weight gain and require digestive enzymes to be taken with all food and drink. 

  

 Until recently, all treatments for CF were directed at disease symptoms such as airway clearance \(physiotherapy and muco\-active inhaled drugs\), antibiotics, nutritional supplements and treatments for complications such as diabetes and liver disease. During periods of stability, pwCF spend 1\-2 hours daily on their treatments. Periods of ill\-health frequently necessitate hospital admission \(average 14 days\) for intravenous antibiotics. Patients also experience acute loss of lung function, painful procedures \(e.g. repeated venous access\) and consequences of high dose antibiotics \(allergies, gastrointestinal disturbance, development of antimicrobial resistance and drug toxicity including kidney damage and deafness\). Despite this huge burden of treatment and healthcare costs, CF is progressive and relentless. Lung health is lost progressively and life expectancy severely reduced; even with advances in diagnosis and therapy over the last decades, median age of death in the UK is approximately 30 years. The only option for end\-stage lung disease is transplantation, if available, but this is not curative and only has a 50% 5\-yr survival. 

 CFTR modulators restore the defective cellular processes underlying key symptoms, significantly changing the approach to CF management and thus have been genuinely transformative. 

 Professor Davies’ programme provided the critical clinical evidence for licensing the first of these drugs, ivacaftor \(Kalydeco\), by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) for ≥12 year olds in 2012, and younger children in 2015 \[ **A**\]. Although only suitable for a minority \(5\-8%\) of patients, its impacts have a far wider reach, as they provide evidence of the long\-term benefits of CFTR functional restoration. Indeed, 4\-5 year observational data collected through national \(US and UK\) patient registries confirm the acute improvements in lung function \[ **B**\], but also describe slowing the rate of lung function loss; reduction in lung infection; hospitalisation and treatment for exacerbations; optimisation in nutritional health and quality of life scores with reduced frequency of diabetes. These benefits translated into prolonged survival and a reduced need for lung transplantation. 

 The dual combination Orkambi \(lumacaftor/ivacaftor\) was approved by the EMA in 2015 \(≥12 years old\) and in 2017, for patients ≥ 6 years old \[ **C**\]. Findings from the EXPAND trial provided pivotal efficacy evidence that contributed to the approval of Symkevi \(tezacaftor/ivacaftor\) for 12 year olds in 2018 \[ **D**\]. These dual combinations demonstrate a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbation and improvements in LCI. Orkambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco were commissioned in England and Northern Ireland \(October 2019\); Orkambi and Symkevi were made available in Scotland \(September 2019\) and Wales \(November 2019\) \[ **E**\]. 

 The triple combination Trikafta/Kaftrio \(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor\) was approved for pwCF ≥12 years old by the FDA in 2019 and EMA in 2020 \[ **F**\]. NHS England immediately announced availability of the drug to all eligible patients, giving >7,000 patients access to a CFTR modulator, subsequently followed by Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland \[ **G**\]. Data from the phase 3 trial in 6\-11 year olds has been announced, with regulatory approval expected in Q4 2021 \[ **H**\]. Trikafta/Kaftrio leads to greater restoration of CFTR function than ivacaftor in both laboratory and clinical assessments. Trials also demonstrated even greater acute benefits \(lung function\- FEV<sub>1</sub> increasing by 14%\-, admissions to hospital, weight gain\). The fact that this combination is suitable for approximately 80\-85% of pwCF worldwide who possess 1 or 2 F508del mutations amplifies these impacts substantially. 

 The major impacts described thus far accrue in patients commencing these drugs as adolescents or adults. There is accumulating evidence that restoring CFTR function in early life, before end\-organ damage is irreversible, could be even more impactful. The design of paediatric modulator trials, led globally by Davies, allowed rapid translation of early data from older cohorts in to younger/healthier children. The EMA has recently approved ivacaftor to treat babies as young as 4 months of age, shortly after their diagnosis \[ **I**\]. 

 Furthermore, for the first time, the field of treating CF has witnessed a substantial proportion of children demonstrating restored function of the pancreas, an organ hitherto considered irreversibly destroyed antenatally. For some children, early access to highly effective modulators, may lead to a complete change in the way CF manifests as a disease, with the possibility that life span could approach that of healthy people. 

 In the UK Kalydeco is available to infants ≥4 months with gating/ residual function mutations \(\~7\-8%\), Orkambi to children aged ≥ 2yrs with 2 copies of F508del \(\~45%\), Symkevi to people aged ≥ 6 with 2 copies of F508del \(\~45%\) or residual function mutations \(\~10%\) and Kaftrio to individuals aged  ≥ 12 years old with 1 or 2 copies of F508del \(80\-85%\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Increasing demand on healthcare systems requires innovative resource management to improve patient outcomes while remaining cost\-effective. Cardiff University research into queueing theory, optimisation methods, and scheduling enabled substantial efficiency gains in the healthcare sector. Through these mathematical methods, Cardiff’s research was fundamental to healthcare improvement projects in the UK´s National Health Service \(NHS\) and within a university hospital in Germany. This included improvements in operating theatre efficiency for a new £350M hospital, cost reduction and environmental benefits for bronchoscopy device logistics, improving health outcomes within a community mental health service, and reducing instances of pressure ulcers through improved understanding of staff behaviours and care. The combined interventions for the NHS and the German hospital saved approximately £12.2M.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Healthcare systems typically operate in environments of uncertainty and variability within highly complex and connected networks. Hundreds of patients may pass through different care pathways each day, each of whom require varying resources to treat them efficiently and effectively. The Cardiff Operational Research \(OR\) group investigates the application of mathematical modelling to improve health outcomes and service delivery. Modelling is used to forecast demand, schedule clinics, calculate the required workforce size and mix of skills to correctly roster staff, schedule operating theatres and assignment of surgeons, and reduce waiting times and cancellations, among other uses. 

 **2.1** **Meeting Healthcare Needs** 

 Patient movements through healthcare systems can be represented by networks of queues constrained by available resources. The stochastic nature of demand on acute healthcare services and the consequences for resource requirements, required the development of complex methods and simulations by the OR group. 

 The Cardiff modelling approach combined machine learning and conditional phase\-type models to capture resource needs and risk predictors enabling better prediction service times in healthcare settings **\[3.1\]**. Further research paired queueing theory with optimisation methods to determine \(a\) appropriate size and skill\-mix of hospital staff **\[3.2\]** and \(b\) scheduling of hospital\-wide resources in a flexible and agile manner by approximating patient length of stay and resource capacity across flexible variables using a rolling horizon approach **\[3.3\]**. 

 The Cardiff team also optimised use of equipment in healthcare settings. For example, the optimisation of order sets to reduce clinical workload in the care prescription process by using a Greedy algorithm **\[3.4\]** and determining the optimal mix of bronchoscopes through a strategic decision support tool **\[3.5\]**. These methods can be performed quickly and efficiently and are designed for use by hospital planners without highly specialised expertise. 

 **2.2 E\-HOSPITAL** 

 Healthcare settings require decision\-making at every level, from strategic decisions around staffing levels and equipment, to effective triaging of patients day\-to\-day. The Cardiff OR group, in collaboration with healthcare providers at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board **\[G3.1\]**, worked extensively since 2014 to develop a software suite able to address the complex needs of healthcare providers. This research was extended by combining the underpinning methodological concepts into a novel comprehensive modelling platform known as E\-HOSPITAL **\[3.6\]**. 

 E\-HOSPITAL is the only platform which combines strategic, tactical, and operational decision levels for healthcare operations in one platform. It contains multiple planning approaches published in the literature, such as case mix planning on the strategic level, as well as scheduling problems on the tactical and operational level. It features real\-world\-motivated extensions of planning decisions \(e.g. enabling incorporation of therapy planning in case mix decisions\). These test cases are instanced and solved, and the results fed back to the graphical user interface to be reviewed.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff researchers formed strategic alliances with multiple Welsh NHS health boards to engage healthcare professionals with Operational Research \(OR\). Application of the research outlined in Section 2: **1\)** provided healthcare decision\-makers with reliable modelling data to better provide service to patients, while training NHS staff to further improve their data analysis services. Through this engagement, the research led to: **2\)** improved hospital designs; **3\)** increased efficiency of frontline mental health services; and **4\)** reduced instances of painful pressure ulcers. 

 **4.1 Setting up dedicated modelling units in NHS Health Boards** 

 Harper is a founding Director of the Health Modelling Centre Cymru \(hmc<sup>2</sup>\), which works with clinicians and NHS managers to apply modelling techniques to healthcare settings. In 2014, hmc<sup>2</sup> partnered with the Aneurin Bevan Continuous Improvement Unit \(ABCi\), which provides mathematical modelling capability for the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board \(ABUHB\). To support this work, the Cardiff team established the Mathematical Modelling Unit within ABCi, additionally training NHS staff in how to apply OR models to develop and test alternative approaches to healthcare management. Trish Chalk, Clinical Futures Lead at ABCi said of the partnership: “ *This unique and innovative partnership has delivered considerable impact in developing and applying OR methods for improving our NHS services and patient outcomes*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 In addition, hmc<sup>2</sup> initiated the novel researchers\-in\-residence programme in partnership with NHS Wales, supporting both Aneurin Bevan and Cardiff and Vale University Health Boards, which collectively serve over 1.1 million people. This programme embedded modelling techniques within the improvement work undertaken at the health boards, for example: modelling the dynamics of day surgery flow and clinic flow at Royal Gwent Hospital to advise on capacity needs and to reduce patient waiting times; analysing the effect of individuals presenting in A&E under the influence of alcohol and to subsequently contribute to planning of a mobile emergency unit in Cardiff city centre on Friday and Saturday nights to alleviate pressures on A&E and limit disruptive behaviours towards staff **\[5.2\]**; and development of a text mining tool to analyse a backlog of more than half a million outpatient letters, saving £630,000 that had been reserved for manual data entry **\[5.3\]**. Judith Paget, Chief Executive of the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, praised the collaboration and the outcomes upon the work of both health boards: “ *The modelling unit’s work has led to better planning and better analysis: far better decisions are made as a result of the input of the modellers*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 In 2015, the collaboration between Cardiff research and NHS practice was recognised by the *Times Higher Education* Awards and received the award for ‘Outstanding Contribution to Innovation and Technology’ **\[5.5\]**. The panel noted that “ *such mathematical modelling has never been used before in the UK healthcare system*” and that the judges were “ *impressed by the range of innovations achieved in a subject area not renowned for this type of collaboration*” **\[5.5**, p.31 **\]**. Harper also received the Companion of OR award from the Operational Research Society, the panel noting that his work has “ *a vision for sustained impact*” and that the ABCi Mathematical Modelling Unit be “ *praised and aspired to by the health OR community*” **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.2 Improving the design and operation of hospitals** 

 ABCi approached Cardiff University in 2016 requesting mathematical modelling support in the early\-stage design of a proposed new hospital near Cwmbran, South Wales, which would serve a population of over 600,000. The E\-HOSPITAL framework was used to assess the potential capacity and required capabilities of the hospital and optimise the flow of patients, reduce unnecessary surgical cancellations, reduce waiting times, and plan for safe care. 

 The ABCi unit specifically highlighted the role of the software in the development of the hospital plans: “ *Dr Gartner and the team at Cardiff University School of Mathematics have been fundamental in helping us to design the new hospital using the E\-HOSPITAL platform*” **\[5.1\]**. The proposed design, including the Cardiff\-recommended structural changes, became the confirmed plans for the Grange University Hospital, a new 470\-bed hospital supported by a £350M investment from Welsh Government. The hospital opened ahead of schedule on 17 November 2020 to assist the South Wales response to both Covid\-19 and winter health pressures **\[5.7\]**. 

 Trish Chalk, Clinical Futures Lead at ABCi outlined the value of the E\-HOSPITAL platform: *“Our provision was 32 operating theatres. Using E\-HOSPITAL, you have helped us to identify smarter and more efficient scheduling of operating theatre sessions such that the total number of staffed operating rooms across ABUHB has been reduced by 2”* **\[5.1\]**. Chalk confirmed that this equates to a saving for the Health Board of around £900,000 each year, totalling £2.7M to date. Through early identification of surplus requirements, and the associated costs in staffing operating theatres, the Health Board was able to reallocate resources previously earmarked for the surplus theatres: “ *A substantial saving which means we can reinvest these funds into other aspects of our services*” **\[5.1\]**. The modelling was praised not only for the improved efficiency in financial costs, but also for maintaining the proposed level of service to the local population despite the reduced number of operating theatres: “ *It should be noted that this reduction has been made possible even whilst accommodating for growth in demand”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 The Cardiff team also applied E\-HOSPITAL to identify cost savings for University Hospital Munich. The platform was able to determine the optimal mix and inventory control of disposable and reusable bronchoscopy devices, eliminating the need for single\-use disposable bronchoscopy devices. Dr Günther Edenharter, Specialist in General Medicine at University Hospital Munich, stated: “ *Before your \[Dr Gartner\]’s work, we disposed of 950 units per year. Thanks to your work, we have removed entirely the need to dispose these units”* which has *“resulted in substantial environmental and economic savings*” **\[5.8\]**. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been reduced by six tons each year together with annual cost savings of €182,350 \(around £152,252\). 

 **4.3 Supporting mental health outreach teams** 

 Cardiff research supported the provision of mental health services across South Wales, focussing on Assertive Outreach Teams \(AOTs\). AOTs are a novel patient\-led service which enable mental health professionals to identify and more readily respond to the needs of severely mentally ill adults, placing them on an appropriate care pathway to avoid progression of the patient’s condition to the point of hospitalisation. At Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, however, AOTs were perceived as a costly service with poorly understood benefits; these were due to be cut. 

 Modelling and statistical analysis work from the Cardiff group quantified the benefits achieved by AOTs, which supported the business case made to the health board to continue to fund these teams. The Cardiff team developed a caseload management tool, incorporating clinical, demographic and staffing variables, such as medical history, specific patient needs, staff skill\-mix, resource levels and availability, and geospatial demand and travel times. This enabled AOTs to better coordinate complex caseloads with further benefits for patients and the health board, as noted below **\[5.9\]**. Dr Izabela Spernaes, ABCi Mathematic Modelling Unit Lead, explained that AOT services were at great risk of closing and that *“the analysis and modelling provided by the School of Mathematics resulted in significant benefits of AOT services”* **\[5.9\]**. The benefits identified as a result of the Cardiff research include **\[5.9\]**: 

-  *“Improved patient outcomes measured by a reduction in the Adult Camberwell Assessment of Need \(CANSAS\) per patient by an average of 51%.”* The CANSAS measures severe needs for mentally ill adults across a range of physiological and psychological factors, such as psychological distress, self\-care, and physical heath. 

-  A reduction in *“ineffective and unnecessary acute hospital admissions by 79%.”* Acute admissions are those which require diagnostic tests, treatment, and follow\-up care. There was also a 66% reduction in the number of crisis admissions \(hospital stays when the patient is highly vulnerable\) from 2.76 stays on average per patient to 0.93 *.* The mental wellbeing benefits to the patients are difficult to quantify, but savings to the NHS Board were calculated at £7.3M per annum from crisis admission reduction alone. 

-  *“A 65% reduction in time taken off work by patients due to severe mental health episodes.”* Days off due to severe mental health episodes went from an average of 41.8 days per patient per year to 14.6 days. 

 **4.4 Reducing pressure ulcers** 

 Pressure ulcers, which can occur when patients spend significant time in bed, are painful, impair mobility, and diminish a patient’s quality of life. Low staff morale has been identified as causing lapses in care, leading in increased instances of pressure ulcers \(among other unintended consequences\), which then further decreases staff morale, generating a negative feedback loop. Pressure ulcers are also costly to health boards; for example, pressure ulcers costed Aneurin Bevan University Health Board more than £500,000 per annum in compensation to affected patients. 

 To address this problem, Cardiff researchers embedded within ABCi developed a comprehensive simulation \(system dynamics\) model of the health board’s Unscheduled Care \(USC\) system. This modelled staff wellbeing and its impact on clinical performance and identified that current measures being implemented by the Trust would not be sufficient to reduce health acquired pressure ulcer incidences at the Royal Gwent Hospital. 

 The model was used to identify negative feedback loops, including understanding and quantification of dependencies between staff behaviours and factors, such as resource utilisation, morale, sickness rates and use of agency staff. Consequently, joint learning sessions with Cardiff University researchers and ABCi staff were developed to help Unscheduled Care staff understand the complex dynamics of the health system. In addition, spreadsheet\-based monitoring tools were developed together with a Consultant Clinical Psychologist in order to track staff wellbeing. These interventions helped prevent negative feedback loops occurring and transformed patient care from potentially harmful to safe **\[5.10\]**. As a result, “ *within two years, up to ten frontline teams prevented \(at least\) 265 pressure ulcers and averted more than £1.5 million in cost while securing better quality care for patients and improved patient experience*” **\[5.10\]**. The approach won the NHS Wales Award 2019 in the category Improving Patient Safety. 

 In summary, Cardiff research into mathematical modelling techniques was used by Welsh NHS Health Boards to improve patient outcomes and the delivery of services. Close collaboration through the Cardiff\-NHS Wales innovative researchers\-in\-residence programme, and via international partnership with University Hospital Munich, enabled efficient design of hospitals, improved the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health outreach teams, and reduced pressure ulcers.  This led to direct cost savings of at least £12.1M for the NHS, as well as \~£150,000 savings for the University Hospital Munich hospital in Germany.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Climate change, caused by greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions, is one of humanity’s greatest environmental challenges. Research led by the University of Aberdeen has developed a range of decision support tools for industry, land managers and policy makers utilizing the best scientific understanding to enable real\-world reduction in GHG emissions. The “Cool Farm Tool” has been adopted by an alliance of 82 of the world’s largest agri\-food businesses and has been used for over 47,000 assessments in 118 countries. It has delivered demonstrable and very significant reductions in GHG emissions from their food production chains. The Windfarm Carbon Calculator has been adopted by the Scottish Government for all windfarm\-planning applications of over 50 MW and is used by industry, non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) and government to assess potential impacts. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Greenhouse gases are created by a number of activities, especially food production and power generation, and are the main driver of climate change. 

 The United Nations has estimated that by 2050 the world will need to produce 70% more food to support a global population of 9,000,000,000; up to a third of all GHGs come from the global food system. The migration of power generation to sustainable technologies, such as wind turbines, is reducing the level of GHGs produced. However, the construction of windfarms, especially if they are built on carbon rich peatlands, can lead to the release of GHGs. Minimizing such emissions delivers the maximum positive environmental benefits. Models and tools developed by the University of Aberdeen have provided powerful methods to estimate greenhouse gas emissions, which have enabled mitigation actions across a number of industries. 

 The research presented in this case study was led by University of Aberdeen researchers Pete Smith \(Professor of Soils & Global Change 2001–present\) and Jo Smith \(Professor in Soil Organic Matter and Nutrient Modelling 2001–present\). Other key researchers were Jon Hillier \(Reader in Biological Sciences 2006–2018\), Euan Phimister \(Chair in Economics 1997–present\) and Paul Hallett \(Professor of Biological Sciences 2008–present\). The team collaborated with colleagues at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research \(CGIAR\) research centres \(Claire Stirling, Tek Sapkota, Wolde Bori, Bedru Balana\) and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine \(Alan Dangour and colleagues\). Other partners were Forest Research \(Mike Perks\), the James Hutton Institute \(Jagadeesh Yeluripati and colleagues\), The Sustainable Food Lab \(Daniella Malin\) and industry, Cool Farm Alliance \(Rich Heathcote\) and Yara, a leading agrochemical company \(Frank Brentrup\). 

 The tools presented in this case study were included in the REF2014 \(Windfarm Carbon Calculator and Cool Farm Tool\). Since that time the tools have been substantially developed further and been deployed more widely, as such, additional impacts have been achieved. 

 The tools are based on theoretical models of biogeochemical processes and greenhouse gas emissions, described in over 300 journal publications by the team since the REF2014 \[1\]. After the models were evaluated with independent data and demonstrated to be robust, the team worked with industry partners \(such as the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency  \(SEPA\) for windfarms and the Cool Farm Alliance for the Cool Farm Tool\) to translate the complex models into tools that could accept readily obtainable, real\-world inputs from users in industry. 

 Research into greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture \[3\] led to the development of the Cool Farm Tool \(2008\) in association with Unilever. It used simplified relationships between agricultural management practices \(e.g. fertilization, tillage, irrigation, etc.\) and emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Since 2013 the Cool Farm Tool has been refined to extend its applicability to perennial crops \(e.g. apples, figs and olives\) \[4\]. A water module \[5\] has now been added that estimates the water footprint of a crop in addition to its greenhouse gas emissions. 

 The Windfarm Calculator estimates the carbon payback time for a windfarm – the time required for net carbon losses associated with building the windfarm to be balanced by carbon savings through clean energy. Using information such as the depth of peat on which the windfarm would be built and the extent of drainage around the infrastructure, the Calculator \(2008\) enables planners to avoid developments on sensitive sites, while permitting developments on those where a windfarm does not result in degradation of sensitive soils. 

 A major evolution of the Windfarm Calculator was the introduction of further modelling \(2018\) to understand the impact of repowering on carbon emissions; repowering is the process of replacing old wind turbines with new technology. Whilst wind farms exist to generate electricity with minimal carbon \(C\) footprint, an assessment of repowering has to take into account key processes that affect this such as embedded C \(as CO<sub>2</sub> emissions\) used in the construction of the repowered wind farm, and any disturbance to the environment that can reduce its capacity to sequester Carbon, including the effectiveness of restoration at the end\-of\-life \[2\]. This project, managed by ‘Construction Scotland Innovation Centre’ and led by the Universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen, fostered collaboration between the SEPA, Engineering company, ARUP Group and Scottish and Southern Energy plc \(SSE\) and ensured the tool would be appropriate to influence the development of the next generation of windfarms.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Aberdeen research has benefited multinational food companies and farmers in developed and developing countries. It has influenced Scottish Government policy and has directly enabled measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, informing best practice for future wind turbine installations. 

 The impact can be summarized under three headings: 

 1.Improvement in the environmental performance of agri\-food companies 

 2.Influencing agricultural practice in low\- to middle\-income countries 

 3.Reduction in GHG emissions associated with windfarms 

 **Improvement in the environmental performance of agri\-food companies** 

 The Cool Farm Tool \( [https://coolfarmtool.org/](https://coolfarmtool.org/)\) \[S1i\] was developed in partnership with Unilever, which provided validation data from field trials. By 2013 the company had partnered with 17 industry competitors and created the Cool Farm Alliance in order to enable interested agri\-food companies to use the tool to plan their GHG reduction strategies. Project data is confidential to each individual company, but all members can see anonymized aggregate data. Since REF2014, Cool Farm Alliance membership has further grown to 82 companies. There are 10,500 registered users and the tool has been used in 118 different countries to make 47,000 assessments. The success and utility of the tool meant that in 2014 ownership was transferred from UoA to the Cool Farm Alliance, which now administers it and implements updates from the research team \[S1ii\]. 

 Members of the Alliance include Unilever, PepsiCo, McDonald’s, M&S, McCain, Mars, Kellogg’s, Heineken, Branston, Danone, Tesco, Heinz and Costco \[S2i\]. The companies use the tool to calculate the impact of their operations on the environment and its trade\-off with their productivity. The tool revolutionized the sector’s capacity for empirically based behaviour change, practice and decision\-making and has enabled substantial GHG reductions in food supply chains. These have had a significant, quantified impact on their GHG emissions, for example: 

-  Unilever showed a reduction of 25% in GHG emissions from its tomato farms. The farms represent 80% of global production of field\-grown tomatoes and the top five producing countries \(US, China, Italy, Spain, Turkey\). They now plan to extend this type of analysis to other crops such as onions, garlic, carrots and strawberries \[S2ii\]. 

-  Danone showed an average reduction in emissions of 12% within one year of starting to use the tool in 13 countries and has introduced a “carbon\-adjusted” recurring earnings per share \(EPS\) evolution that takes into account an estimated financial cost for the absolute GHG emissions on its entire value chain \[S2ii\]. 

-  Between 2010 and 2015 ADAS and PepsiCo have been working alongside Walkers Crisps to embed the tool in a project to reduce carbon emissions and water use and have achieved an average reduction of 50% in five years across their UK potato farms \[S2ii\]. These and many similar examples can be found in \[S3i\]. 

 The Agricultural Sustainability Manager \(Europe\) at PepsiCo appreciated that the power of the Cool Farm Tool is that it gives the end user the capacity to properly understand the consequences of individual strategies, saying, *“I like the Cool Farm Tool because it's not a black box. With other tools you… just pay for the study and are delivered the results. This is a better way of engaging.”* \[S3i\]. 

 The development of the water module \(2019\) of the Cool Farm Tool has enabled Solidaridad \(an international development agency\), who have worked with 7,361 farmers in Mexico, Columbia and Peru, to achieve yield improvements of 21% alongside a reduction in emissions of nearly 28,000 tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> eq \[S3ii\]. 

 **Influencing agricultural practice in low\- to middle\-income countries** 

 The Tool was used in over 118 countries between 2013 and 2020. WWF\-India \(World Wide Fund for Nature – India\) produced a report in collaboration with Marks & Spencer and used the Tool to assess the GHG emissions generated by cotton cultivation in Warangal, India, on a pilot scale \[S4i\]. GHG emissions from farms using traditional cultivation methods were compared with those using better management practices \(BMPs\). Traditional cultivation was shown to use almost double the amount of fertiliser compared to BMPs. It exceeded the levels recommended by the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture, India, and produced almost twice the amount of GHG emissions without improving yield. WWF\-India now works with farmers in the Warangal district to promote BMPs in cotton production in order to mitigate environmental impact, as reported by Marks & Spencer \[S4i, ii\]. 

 **Reduction in GHG emissions associated with windfarms** 

 The Carbon Calculator for Windfarms on Scottish Peatlands \(Windfarm Calculator\) \(2008 onwards\) \[2\] was originally developed for the Scottish Government. SEPA assumed ownership of the Calculator in 2013 \[S5i\] and now handle all queries and updates to the tool \(2017\) and the University of Aberdeen team continue to provide technical updates \[S5ii\]. 

 Scottish Government policy was changed in 2017 and published in August 2018, when SEPA made use of the tool compulsory for all planning applications under section 36 – Energy infrastructure: Energy consents \- gov.scot \( [https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy\-consents\-application\-procedure\-and\-publicity\-requirements/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-consents-application-procedure-and-publicity-requirements/)\) for companies attempting to gain energy consents for new onshore windfarms of greater than 50 MW \[S6\]. As per this policy, developers are now required to calculate potential carbon losses and savings from wind farms on Scottish peatlands. By developing an online Carbon Calculator available at <ins>https://informatics.sepa.org.uk/CarbonCalculator/index.jsp</ins>, the University of Aberdeen has facilitated this process and informing best practice for future windfarm developments. In 2016, the tool was adapted into a web\-based version \(which includes the enhancements around forestry, made available by the Scottish Government, the associated factsheet states “ *The improved ease of use \[of the carbon calculator\] will reduce the burden on developers as a consequence of the increased user\-friendliness and the more sophisticated entry checking and guidance. The expectation is that this will reduce the number of resubmissions. The improved quality of submissions will reduce the validation work required. It will allow developers to submit carbon assessments and conduct initial carbon assessment screening tests on their proposed developments online in a self\-service manner. It will allow an aggregated picture to be made of assessments \(initial applications and re\-applications\) across Scotland*” \[S7\]. 

 There have been 10 sites \(totalling 1247 MW of the 2039 MW \(61%\) constructed or applied for since 2016 \[S8\], each of which had to be justified using the tool. This means the Windfarm Calculator has helped retain the huge stock of carbon held in Scottish soils by avoiding the construction of new windfarms on deep peats and forcing a shift in the siting of windfarms to soils lower in carbon. By thus preserving intact peatlands, this provides a two\-way reduction in net GHG emissions. 

 Developments to the Windfarm Calculator, were facilitated through a joint consultancy project with Forest Research \(part of DEFRA\), and Glasgow University \[2\] \(2018\) and highlighted the potential for “repowering” end\-of\-life windfarms \(by replacing old turbines with new technology\) \[2, see p27\]. The results were used to update technical guidance released by the Scottish Government \[S10\] and were included in a policy statement produced by the Scottish Government in 2017 on repowering \[S9\]. 

 After it was published, SSE and Scottish Power assessed the options presented by the report and concluded that the re\-engineering cost per turbine foundation would be between two and three times higher than a new foundation for the target turbine type. This translates into a multi\-million pound cost\-avoidance opportunity for a typical >50 MW windfarm and represents an opportunity to resite windfarms on mineral soils and avoid further degradation of peatlands \[2\]. In May 2020, Scottish Power acquired a 165 MW major new onshore wind project, including the repowering of Scotland’s very first commercial windfarm, Hagshaw Hill. It is expected that the overall project could create 600 peak jobs and 280 long\-term jobs. Stated in the press release, ‘ *Hagshaw Hill Repowering Ltd has Section 36 planning consent for up to 14 turbines with max tip height of 200m, a 20 MW battery storage facility and a grid connection already secured*.’ \[S11\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Coronary heart disease accounts for nearly 12% of all deaths in the UK and results from abnormal narrowing, or stenosis, of blood vessels feeding the heart. **Instantaneous wave\-free ratio** \(iFR\) is a diagnostic tool, developed at Imperial, to assess the severity of coronary artery stenosis. 

 iFR received a CE mark and FDA approval in 2014 and is now recommended by all major international guidelines to stratify selection of patients to undergo either coronary stenting or bypass surgery. iFR can assess stenosis severity within a few heartbeats and reduces both procedural time and costs by 10% compared to the leading alternative \(Fractional Flow Reserve; FFR\), resulting in a savings of USD896 per patient. Importantly, iFR obviated the need for costly and unpleasant hyperaemic drugs that are required for FFR. By performing the measurement without these drugs, iFR reduced adverse procedural symptoms by 90% relative to FFR. 

 iFR has been licensed to Volcano\-Philips in 2014 and has now been integrated into their product.  It is now being used in more than 5000 clinical cardiac catherization laboratories in more than 30 countries.  iFR has been used more than 100,000 procedures between 2018 and 2020 in Europe alone. The estimated saving in these cases alone is in excess of USD100,000,000.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Background</ins> 

 When the left ventricle contracts, it generates waves of blood pressure and flow that propagate along the arteries. When waves reach discontinuities in vessel shape or wall compliance, as occur at vessel branches, some of the wave energy is reflected. With each heartbeat, 100’s to 1000’s of reflected waves superimpose to determine the pressure and flow at each point in the arterial tree. Such a myriad of interacting waves creates a complex dynamic environment that complicates clinical measurements of arterial pressure. A notable example is the catheter\-based measurement of the pressure drop across a coronary stenosis \(a focal narrowing of coronary arteries that feed the heart\) that serves as a key indicator for severity of coronary heart disease, which is a leading cause of death worldwide. The traditional method to measure the pressure drop across a coronary stenosis, known as Fractional Flow Reserve \(FFR\), is performed after administering a powerful vasodilator \(adenosine\) to minimise downstream vessel resistance and thereby reduce the confounding effect of downstream pressure waves. 

 Wave analysis is typically based on Fourier decomposition, but this method is inadequate for analysing arterial flow. That is because Fourier decomposition, producing only sinusoidal waves with no beginning or end, is unable to specify the position of individual wavefronts in space and time, which is necessary to discriminate upstream from downstream waves and account for their interactions. To overcome these limitations, Prof. Kim Parker in 1990 introduced **Wave Intensity Analysis \(WIA\)** to analyse non\-linear wave propagation in arteries. WIA conceptualises pressure and flow waves as a superposition of infinitesimal wavefronts \(as opposed to sinusoidal wavetrains as in Fourier analysis\). Mathematically, WIA is formulated based on Riemann’s method of characteristics, but the equations derived for its practical application are surprisingly simple. By 2000, WIA had been successfully applied to systemic and pulmonary arteries, but these applications were relatively straightforward because all waves could be attributed to primary waves generated by ventricular contraction with superimposed reflections and re\-reflections of these primary waves. 

 <ins>Research Conducted</ins> <ins>since 2000</ins> 

 It was not until 2000 that Parker, working with a team of international colleagues, first applied WIA to coronary arteries of dogs \[R1\]. This is particularly challenging because the downstream arteries that branch from the main coronaries are embedded within heart muscle that cyclically contracts and compresses the vessels during each heartbeat. This generates additional waves and introduces a time\-varying downstream resistance that further complicates the interpretation of pressure measurements in the coronary arteries. 

 Prof. Parker, working closely with colleagues in the Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Justin Davies and Professor Jamil Mayet, then applied WIA to analyse pressure and flow waves in the coronary arteries of human patients \[R2\]. This team used WIA to identify the dominant waves and attribute wave generation to the downstream compressive effect of the surrounding heart muscle \[R3\]. Differences in wave propagation between the right and left coronary arteries \(which have the same upstream pressure\) were shown to originate from differences in the strength of muscular contraction between the right and left ventricles \[R4\]. 

 Importantly, WIA revealed a brief **“wave\-free” period** within the coronary arteries that occurs during the middle of the resting or diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. During the wave\-free period, heart muscle relaxes, minimising downstream resistance and reducing the compressive forces responsible for generating pressure waves in the coronary arteries \[R5\]. Identification of the wave\-free period inspired the development of iFR \( **Instantaneous wave\-free ratio**\), the new diagnostic tool capable of assessing the severity of coronary artery stenoses. When using iFR, one first identifies the wave\-free period, then computes the ratio of distal coronary pressure \(downstream of the stenosis\) to upstream aortic pressure during this period. This works because during the wave\-free period, the pressure drop across the coronary stenosis is unaffected by downstream pressure waves and thus the pressure drop can be measured directly using pressure transducers within the angiogenic catheter. Most importantly, this measurement can be done without administering powerful vasodilators. 

 A proof\-of\-concept study with patients indicated that the pressure ratio measured by iFR was a good indicator of the functional effect of the stenosis on flow, and clinical trials were started to compare the efficacy of iFR analysis against the current standard FFR \[R6\]. These studies showed that iFR yields equivalent classification as FFR for coronary stenosis severity, but without requiring the use of powerful hyperaemic drugs that are responsible for adverse procedural symptoms.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Background</ins> 

 Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death, killing 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women per year worldwide. The primary cause is a build\-up of fatty plaque\-like material in the wall of the coronary artery that narrows the artery lumen \(stenosis\). Coronary heart disease is life\-threatening because the stenosis reduces blood flow to the heart, resulting in angina \(chest pain\), heart attack and stroke and can lead to heart failure and abnormal heart rhythm. 

 Coronary heart disease can be treated with drugs or, in more extreme cases, coronary artery bypass surgery or stenting \(placing an intravascular metallic frame to force open the artery\). Each year, stenting is performed in more than 500,000 patients worldwide. Selecting patients for different treatments is often tricky and based on diagnostic angiography, which generates 2D images of the coronary artery lumen. Cardiologists examine these images to decide the best treatment option, but this is subjective and can be inaccurate due to anatomical differences between patients. A more accurate “functional” assessment of the severity of the stenosis can be obtained by measuring the pressure\-drop across the stenosis using iFR or FFR. Pressure is measured by threading a thin wire, or catheter, containing a miniature pressure transducer into the coronary artery, guided from an incision in the femoral or radial artery. 

 <ins>Impact of</ins> <ins>iFR</ins> 

 
Based on pressure measurements in the coronary artery, either iFR or FFR can be used to assess the severity of disease and the need for stenting. However, iFR and FFR differ because FFR requires use of hyperaemic/vasodilatory agents such as adenosine, while iFR does not. Adenosine is a powerful drug that may cause severe chest pain and is counter\-indicated in children, asthmatics and people with low blood pressure. Eliminating the need for adenosine means that the procedure can be performed faster, with less discomfort and risk. iFR can also be performed on patients who are contra\-indicated for adenosine and so could not otherwise undergo FFR for coronary assessment. During the current REF period, clinicians conducted detailed studies on efficacy of iFR as an alternative to FFR. It has been demonstrated that, **relative to FFR, iFR achieves a 90% reduction in adverse procedural symptoms, 10% reduction in procedure time and a 25% reduction in readmissions \[E1, E2\].** Emerging data suggest that iFR is superior to FFR \[E3\]. These are evidence that the scientific advancements from Parker, Davies, and others from Imperial have been successfully translated from research to clinical applications \[E4\]. 

 iFR was CE marked and was approved by the FDA in 2014 \[E5, E6\].  These regulatory approvals provided a springboard for iFR to progress from a research phase to large scale clinical use after 2014. The invention, which was patented by Imperial Innovations in 2010, was licensed to Volcano\-Philips in 2014. iFR is now part of their product offerings and is used in over 5000 catheter labs around the world, having been studied in over 15,000 patients as part of clinical trial \[E7\]. 

 iFR is included in the 2018 clinical guidelines published by the European Society of Cardiology \(ESC\) and European Association of Cardio\-Thoracic Surgery \(EACTS\), where **iFR receives a Class IA recommendation** \(meaning that there is general agreement that a treatment is beneficial, useful and effective based on data from multiple randomized clinical trials\) \[E8; see table on page 98\]. In the worldwide 2017 guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions \(among other professional clinical societies\), iFR is included as a measurement tool that can be appropriately used to assess the physiological significance of coronary artery stenosis without use of hyperaemic agents \[E9, see pages 2218 §3 and Table 1.1 on page 2224\]. 

 With its inclusion in worldwide guidelines for cardiologist and its integration into Volcano\-Philips’ interventional cardiology devices, the impact of iFR as a standard diagnostic tool has accelerated since 2018. Outside of clinical trials, it is estimated that such interventional cardiology procedure has been used approximately 400,000 times in Europe alone between 2018 and 2020 \[E10\].  While it is impossible to determine whether iFR made a difference to clinician’s decision in each case, it is not unreasonable to estimate that, iFR helped in at least 50% of cases. Therefore the number of patients benefitted from our underpinning research is estimated to be in hundreds of thousands.  Volcano\-Philips estimated that iFR provides a cost reduction of approximately USD900 per patient \[E11\].  Therefore the estimated cost saving attributed to iFR since 2018 in Europe alone is estimated to be at least USD100,000,000.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Hopkins’ research directly challenges the assumption in Scotland that racism and Islamophobia are only of concern in England. It has confronted this Scottish exceptionalism through **changing the political discourse**, **equipping educators** and **informing journalistic practice** nationwide, with additional reach to the rest of the UK. Direct impacts of this research are: 

1.  Establishing the first ever Cross\-Political Party Group on Tackling Islamophobia in the Scottish Parliament; this led to the Scottish Parliament’s cross\-party adoption of a common definition of Islamophobia; 

1.  Training more than 50,000 educators who are now equipped to tackle anti\-Muslim prejudice; 

1.  Providing guidance for journalists on reporting on Islam and Muslims; this was adopted by the National Union of Journalists \(over 38,000 members\) and IMPRESS \(the independent press monitor\), which regulates more than 150 digital and print publications with a combined daily readership over 15,000,000. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research conducted at Newcastle University \(NU\) since 2007 has directly challenged the widely\-held assumption that, in Scotland, racism and Islamophobia are insignificant \(‘Scottish exceptionalism’\). Led by Hopkins, NU’s research has explored issues of racism and Islamophobia in relation to young people \(aged 12–25\) in Scotland from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds \(PUB1–4\). Early research focused on how Scotland’s political, policy and practice settings have avoided addressing racism, which has predominantly been viewed there as an English problem. Hopkins exposed this Scottish exceptionalism by revealing the persistence of Scottish policy\-makers’ disengagement from racism and Islamophobia \(PUB1\). This work points to the exclusion of young Muslims in the aftermath of key international events, such as the complex ways in which, after 9/11, political discourse and the media shaped our experiences of racism and Islamophobia. Follow\-up research with Sikh men demonstrated \- for the first time \- how they resist everyday racism, educate others, and manage multicultural interactions to promote a strong sense of Scottishness \(GRANT1; PUB2\). A key finding is that young Sikh men experience Islamophobia because they are misrecognised as being of Islamic faith. Building upon this work, a project led by Hopkins explored the lived experiences of 382 black and minority ethnic young people \(GRANT2\) across urban, suburban and rural Scotland \(PUB3\). It demonstrated that diverse ethnic and religious\-minority young people – including Sikhs, Hindus, other South Asian non\-religious young people, asylum seekers and refugees and Central and Eastern European migrants – are regularly mistaken for Muslims and, as a result, experience racism and Islamophobia. NU’s research was praised for its novel, ethical and respectful engagement with young people, and related work with students from ethnic minorities led to the co\-production of a research protocol [](https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=31601&p=0) for schools. A further study by Hopkins and Finlay in 2016 on Muslim youth and political participation found that the effect of Islamophobia was either to politicise young Muslims or silence and marginalise them \(PUB4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 NU’s research has directly challenged Scottish exceptionalism on racism and Islamophobia by providing substantial qualitative evidence of serious and widespread issues in Scottish society. While its geographic focus is Scotland, its significance means that the research has had reach beyond Scotland to the rest of the UK. The research has \(A\) **changed the understanding of politicians** and policymakers; \(B\) **equipped educators with knowledge** and skills to address Islamophobia; and \(C\) **enabled journalists to report** on Islam and Muslims in a sensitive and well\-informed manner. 

 **A. Changing the political discourse** 

 NU’s research has directly contributed to and changed political discourse on racism and Islamophobia by: \(i\) prompting the establishment in 2017 of the first ever Cross\-Party Group \(CPG\) on Tackling Islamophobia in the Scottish Parliament; \(ii\) shaping the definition of Islamophobia of the UK All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on British Muslims; and \(iii\) influencing two House of Lords inquiries. In more detail: 

 **\(i\)** In 2017, Hopkins’ team shared with an experienced elected MSP \(Member of the Scottish Parliament\) its report about Muslim youth and political participation \(culminating in PUB4\). This rapidly led to the establishment of Scotland‘s first ever **CPG on Tackling Islamophobia**. The MSP writes: 

 *Peter \[Hopkins\] and I have worked together to establish a Cross\-Party Group on Tackling Islamophobia; Peter’s research has been key to shaping the agenda of this group*. \(IMP1\) 

 This CPG has the largest membership of any CPG and is one of the most active in the Scottish Parliament. The issue of Islamophobia was raised through **four Parliamentary questions** written by Hopkins and submitted through the MSP’s Parliamentary office \(IMP1\), focusing on Hopkins’ team’s specific findings on Islamophobia: the importance of its omission from key initiatives on race \(PUB1\); its gendered nature \(PUB3\); and its vital role in political participation \(PUB4\). In 2019/20, through the CPG, Hopkins led the first ever **Public Inquiry on Islamophobia in Scotland**. The inquiry included a survey devised by Hopkins to focus on key issues identified in PUBS1–4. In February 2020, the findings of the Public Inquiry received widespread media coverage in the main Scottish newspapers, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC News Scotland. In 2019, the Public Inquiry was cited at Westminster by the Leader of the Scottish National Party \(SNP\), in oral evidence to the Home Affairs Committee Islamophobia Inquiry \(IMP2\). 

 Hopkins’ contribution to changing the political discourse directly influenced the wording of the question on religion \(Islam\) in the next **Scottish Population Census** \(IMP3\). He recommended that, to maximise clear demographic information, an option be included to indicate Islamic affiliation in relation to ‘denomination or school’. This was agreed by the National Records of Scotland Census team and is now incorporated into the Census form. 

 **\(ii\)** Extending its reach beyond Scotland, Hopkins’ submission to the **UK APPG on British Muslims** is cited nine times in its report, *Islamophobia Defined* \(IMP4\). This makes points about the risks of not adopting a definition and about ‘ *those mistaken for being Muslim*’ \(PUB2; PUB4\). It cites Hopkins’ recommendation to ‘ *overtly illustrate the nuances and complexities of Islamophobia’.* Further influence is shown by a quote: ‘ *Hopkins opposes the idea of the index* \[proposed to measure the intensity of Islamophobia\] *because “this runs the risk of particular Islamophobic incidents being regarded as more or less serious than others and potentially therefore more or less worthy of attention”*’. 

 The Leader of the SNP confirmed that the Parliamentary Group of the SNP in Westminster adopted the APPG’s definition, like most parties in Westminster \(IMP2\). To date at least 22 local authorities \(covering a population of almost 12,000,000\) and over 30 universities across the UK also adopted it. Hopkins’ research on Islamophobia was cited on 25 April 2019 in **First Minister’s Questions** \(IMP2\), when the MSP urged the First Minister to endorse the APPG’s definition. This intervention led to the First Minister and all political parties in Scotland doing so on 26 April 2019 \(IMP2\). 

 Locally, the findings of NU’s research directly informed a Local Councillor’s motion that **Newcastle City Council** adopt the APPG definition of Islamophobia \(IMP5; PUBS1–4\). Following a public lecture by Hopkins \(29 November 2019, attendance of 400\), it was unanimously resolved: to adopt the APPG definition; to express support for the Home Affairs Committee Islamophobia inquiry; and to write to all mosques and Islamic community organisations in the City to inform them of the Council’s adoption of the motion. This led to an invitation to Hopkins to serve on the advisory group of **Citizens UK** and to subsequently inform their report on everyday hate in the UK \(IMP5\). 

 As a result of his work creating the CPG and informing the APPG definition, Hopkins also worked with TellMAMA \(the leading UK service measuring anti\-Muslim prejudice and supporting victims of Islamaphobia\) to set up its first advisory group in Scotland. Hopkins also led on setting up its first advisory group in North East England, subsequently publishing a  [report](https://www.tellmamauk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ISLAMOPHOBIA-AND-ANTI-MUSLIM-HATRED-IN-NORTH-EAST-ENGLAND-090620.pdf) co\-authored with TellMAMA on Islamophobia in the North East \(IMP5\). Hopkins was also invited to serve as a key panellist on the ongoing North East England Chamber of Commerce Commission into Ethnicity and Discrimination. **Four Parliamentary questions** written by Hopkins, based on findings from the co\-authored report with TellMAMA \(IMP5\), were addressed by Newcastle North’s MP in Westminster. 

 **\(iii\)** NU’s research on Islamophobia has impacted on UK political affairs. Findings from GRANT2 **directly informed** and **are** **cited in two House of Lords Committee reports** \(IMP6\): 

 **Citizenship and Civic Engagement Committee** report – cites NU’s evidence that: 

 *gender and everyday sexism should be considered as a barrier to the participation of British Muslim women in public life… we also observed a growing confidence in young Muslim women, with a number of participants engaging in politics and taking on publicly prominent roles. There are positive signs, then, that young Muslim women are rejecting and challenging gender prejudices and becoming visibly involved in politics and campaigning.* \(p.29\) 

 The results of the UK Government’s response to NU’s recommendations on gender and everyday sexism from GRANT2 included: \(i\) project funding of GBP5,000,000 to increase women’s democratic participation; \(iii\) a new programme to encourage young women from diverse backgrounds to become leaders; and \(iii\) a National Statement of Expectations on engagement with marginalised communities \(IMP6\). 

 **Democracy and Digital Technologies** report – refers specifically to Hopkins’ finding that abuse and hate speech deter people from participating in public life: 

 *Professor Peter Hopkins … told us about his research with young Muslims in the UK, which showed that young people engaged with democracy through social media also received racist and Islamophobic abuse. This had the effect of making them feel more marginalised and less inclined to participate. As discussed above the societal harm to democracy is closely linked to the harm these children experience as individuals.* \(p.39\) 

 The UK Government’s response to this finding indicated that companies are required to have appropriate systems to deal with harmful online content and that the regulator, Ofcom, may take action against those that fail in their duty of care in this respect. It confirmed that the report will inform its response to the Online Harms White Paper Consultation \(IMP6\). 

 **Equipping educators** 

 NU’s research played a pivotal role in equipping educators to better respond and react to issues relating to racism and Islamophobia by: \(i\) advising a Scottish Parliament inquiry about prejudice\-based bullying; \(ii\) informing national educational guidance on anti\-Muslim prejudice; and \(iii\) improving anti\-racist educational practice. In more detail: 

 **\(i\)** Based on Hopkins’ research, in 2018 the **Education Institute for Scotland** \(EIS\) published guidance on challenging anti\-Muslim prejudice. This EIS guidance directly cites both PUB4 and a briefing paper written by the GRANT2 team in 2014. It notes specifically that ‘ *Muslim members, and members from BME backgrounds, who are sometimes misrecognised as Muslim, are subject to similar prejudice*’, citing PUB3 \(IMP7\). The EIS is the largest Scottish teaching union and has a key role as one of Scotland’s most respected voices in education \(almost 55,000 teachers and lecturers in Scotland are members, covering 80% of the entire profession\). 

 **\(ii\)** NU’s research directly informed the **Scottish Parliament’s Equality and Human Rights Committee** inquiry into school bullying \(IMP8\). Its final report notes the ‘ *need for teacher training on prejudice\-based bullying and harassment with a focus on the content of that training in order to improve the confidence of teachers*’. In June 2018, findings from NU’s research from GRANT2 were included in oral evidence as part of a review for this inquiry. The 2018–19 annual committee report responded to the issue of racist and Islamophobic bullying by noting the need for ‘ *preventative and reactive measures against bullying through more support and training… evidence from our draft budget scrutiny showed £4,000,000 has been invested so that schools can collect better data on types of bullying*’. 

 In March 2017 at the University of Edinburgh, more than **120 teachers and educationalists** across Scotland participated in training on race equality and Scottish school education. All reported that their knowledge of how to recognise and respond to issues of Islamophobia in their classrooms had improved significantly: ‘ *I’m now more equipped to recognise the problems of misrecognition and act to fix them*’ \(IMP8\). The training included insights about Islamophobia and misrecognition drawn directly from GRANT2/PUB3. 

 The Depute Head of Shawlands Academy \(one of Scotland’s most ethnically diverse secondary schools\) states that NU’s research ‘ *had a direct impact on the management. It didn’t just embolden our anti\-racist strategy, it shaped it. It has changed practice, it has informed CPD for staff’*. A research protocol co\-produced in 2016–17 by Hopkins and a group of 25 ethnic minority Shawlands students has been used since 2016 by Glasgow City Council to regulate all researchers wishing to access pupils in city schools for participation in research. This protocol is regarded by the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement as an important resource for supporting quality engagement \(IMP9\). 

 Motivated both by participating in GRANT2 and by co\-producing the research protocol, in 2017 students from Shawlands were inspired to work with ‘Young Scot’ \(a national information and citizenship service for young people\) on developing young people’s vision for race equality. This made 22 recommendations and contributed 40 ideas for change to promote race equality. When asked about the impact of NU’s research on pupils, the Depute Head exclaimed: ‘ *Phenomenal\! Absolutely phenomenal\! I think that the whole process had a profound effect upon those young people*’ \(IMP9\). 

 **\(iii\)** Reaching beyond Scotland and utilising NU’s research, a specific case study on Islamophobia features in an animated video produced by Hopkins and used since 2018 by **Northumbria Police** as a mandatory component of their training for Hate Crime Champions. To date, those who have participated \(IMP9\) are from school and colleges \(more than 5,200 students and 150 staff\), local authorities \(150 staff\) and voluntary sector groups \(125 staff\), as well as 200 police officers and 40 front\-office staff. 

 **C. Changing journalistic practice** 

 NU research changed journalistic practice on reporting on Islam and Muslims. In late 2019, Hopkins and Uzma Mir co\-authored Scotland’s **first set of media guidelines** for reporting on Islam and Muslims. This draws directly on NU research findings on media representation \(PUB1\), misrecognition \(PUB2; PUB3\) and political participation \(PUB4\). The guidelines were adopted by the National Union of Journalists \(NUJ\) \(membership over 38,000\). The lead organiser of NUJ’s Scotland office noted that the guidelines are ‘ *informed, detailed and take into account the working practices of journalists*’ and are thus key to ‘ *developing responsible, informed journalism in this area*’. Although published only recently, the guidelines have already impacted on and changed the practice of key users. The lead news and feature writer at *The Courier* newspaper \(daily readership 35,000\) noted: ‘ *these guidelines provide a valuable checklist on ensuring that a piece is accurate and avoids inadvertently offending members of Scottish society*’ \(IMP10\). 

 Demonstrating the extended reach of NU’s research, these media guidelines have been officially adopted by  [IMPRESS](https://impress.press/about-us/) \(Independent Monitor for the Press\), the UK regulator of over 150 digital and print publications that reach more than 15,000,000 readers each month \(IMP10\). 

 **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

 Working with these key stakeholder groups \(politicians, educators and journalists\) has not only debunked the notion that Islamophobia is not an issue in Scotland; it has gone much further in addressing the effects of Islamophobia through informing policy and practice both there and across the UK. As the MSP notes \(see IMP1\): 

 *For too long Islamophobia was seen as an English problem which made it almost impossible to tackle politically and in everyday practice in Scotland.  Peter Hopkins’ research has been instrumental in providing the evidence needed to challenge this perspective and address the effects of Islamophobia in the country. This has directly led to the formation of the first ever CPG and the subsequent adoption of a common definition of Islamophobia which means we are now equipped to tackle its effects*.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Medical device auditory alarms are typically poor in design, and are usually hard to learn and discriminate between, difficult to locate, and are usually shrill and aversive, leading to ‘alarm fatigue’. Working closely with international standards organisations, Prof Judy Edworthy has led a project which has contributed to the update of a global medical device safety standard \(IEC 60601\-1\-8\) where cognitive science and psychoacoustic theory have driven the development of both new alarms and appropriate guidance on alarms for non\-experts. Current beneficiaries are key stakeholders \(standards committee members and their networks\) from five continents who have served on the committees and other relevant bodies, developers, and early\-moving medical device manufacturers.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Auditory alarms research lies at the interface of auditory perception, auditory cognition and human factors research. Typically, clinical audible alarms are very poor, and because no established set of agreed metrics have historically been available to allow a person to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an auditory alarm, there has been reluctance to change them even when they are known to be problematic. In 2015 relevant IEC and ISO committees identified high\-priority issues that needed to be addressed in the next amendment to the international clinical safety standard IEC 60601\-1\-8, ‘Medical electrical equipment \- Part 1\-8: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance \- Collateral Standard: General requirements, tests and guidance for alarm systems in medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems’ which included updating the audible alarms specified within. Prof Edworthy was invited to direct this process and used it as a way not only to develop better, safer, alarms but also to show how the new alarms were developed and tested, and to provide a model as to how to approach assessing the effectiveness of audible alarms, which until now has had no commercially\- or scientifically\-agreed protocol. 

 The underpinning principle of almost all findings is that the more a sound resembles a complex, harmonically rich and meaningful sound \(and the less like a harmonically poor, aversive and meaningless beep\) the better it will perform as an audible alarm. Thus ‘auditory icons’ \(typically complex, real\-world or metaphorical sounds\) are better candidates for alarm sounds than the beeps, bells buzzers and melodies typically used. A series of published studies was carried out showing the development and testing of the sounds eventually adopted in the update. Most of this research demonstrates clearly that auditory icons, or auditory\-icon\-style alarm sounds, perform better as alarm sounds than almost all other sounds. Aside from the earlier development studies, the auditory icons tested in the studied listed were the auditory icons now incorporated into the standard, giving them provenance in the public domain.  These studies also provide a set of measurements and methods which can be used for others for developing and evaluating alarms in the future. 

  

 **Learnability**: The ease with which sounds can be learned is strongly influenced by the degree to which the sound and its meaning are related. Edworthy et al<sup>1</sup> demonstrate this with respect to several sets of potential alarm sounds which were designed to have varying sound\-meaning relationships. The sounds with the best learnability were auditory icons. For groups of sounds, learnability can also be influenced by the acoustic variability of the set of sounds being learned \[3.2 & 3.3\].This is important because many alarm sounds are typically used in one environment. McDougall et al \[3.3\] provides a fully factorial exploration of these two key variables \(sound\-meaning relationship and acoustic variability\), showing that both factors influence learnability. Here, auditory icons are demonstrated to be good alarms because they have very clear meanings and are acoustically diverse. 

  

 **Localizability**: Using known principles from auditory perception, Edworthy et al \[3.1 & 3.4\] demonstrate how a person’s ability to locate a sound source is related to the harmonic structure of the sound and that more harmonically complex alarm signals such as auditory icons are easier to localize than harmonically poor tonal ‘beeps’. 

  

 **Acoustic masking**: Prof Edworthy has worked on an NIH\-funded project with Dr Matthew Bolton \(SUNY at Buffalo, US\) and Dr Andrew Boyd, University of Illinois at Chicago, US, from 2016\-2019. This project has developed a formal methods approach \(a computer science approach\) to predicting masking of audible alarms, confirmed through testing of human participants \[3.5\]. The results demonstrate that there is high potential for masking of one alarm by another within the previous \(until 2020\) IEC 60601\-1\-8 alarms, largely brought about by their similarity to one another. Masking is less likely if the alarms have greater variability, for example, if auditory icons are used. 

  

 **Audibility**: Prof Edworthy has carried out a series of studies on audibility of the best\-performing sounds from the earlier studies \[3.1 & 3.4\] in typical Intensive Care Unit noise along with colleagues at the University of Miami, FL, US \[3.6\], showing that the harmonically rich and complex auditory icons are audible at very low signal\-to\-noise ratios. This means that they can be presented at lower loudness levels that traditional alarms. 

  

 **Simulation**: Bennett et al \[3.6\], as well as other studies, also demonstrated that auditory icons produce faster and more accurate responses from anaesthetist participants than traditional alarms, and that the use of auditory icons is less stressful and fatiguing than the tonal alarms typically used in clinical care. 

  

 All of the studies demonstrate that auditory icons  \(in this case the specific icons subsequently incorporated into the standard\) are very good candidates as alarm signals because they are easy to learn, easy to localize, are resistant to masking, and are less fatiguing to respond to than other, more traditional, alarm signals. Because they have been published in peer\-reviewed journals, the methods used to develop and test are also robust and in the public domain for all relevant stakeholders. Such attention to the provenance and science behind a set of alarms is unique.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Updating the standard:** 

  

 Three connected committees \(AAMI 60601\-1\-8, IEC 60601\-1\-8 and a joint alarms working group\), each comprising members across five continents, were tasked in 2015 with updating the standard AAMI/IEC 60601\-1\-8.  The committees co\-opted Prof Edworthy to their membership, and recognized that all alarm\-related activity needed to be transparent, documented, and backed up by research to be found in the public domain, as well as requiring regular updates and presentations to the committee by Prof Edworthy, in order to win approval from all quarters. Prof Edworthy recommended quite early on in this process that auditory icons \(those developed and tested in the research papers\) would be the best alarms to adopt for the update of the standard. Convincing stakeholders that a change to sounds which will ultimately dramatically change the soundscape of all clinical areas, even with overwhelming evidence, required considerable time and attention. 

  

 The impacts claimed are policy change, as well as changes to understanding and process. Some parts of this project are immediately accessible to a broad range of beneficiaries, for example downloadable alarm sounds are available to all without further development from stakeholders. Other parts of the project, such as the guidance and the table discussed below, are useful for medical device companies, and known experts in this field who have now been provided with tools which provide greater understanding of the design and evaluation process. 

  

 **The impacts:** 

  

1.  **Publication of the standard** 

 Updating a worldwide standard takes years of work, the pace of which is dictated by the various agreements, procedures, votes, and interactions between the relevant committees and authorities. The final, voting draft of the standard was voted on in July and August 2019 and resulted in favourable votes from 17/18 countries and 19/19 countries respectively across the two key alarms committees. The updated standard was then published in July 2020. The updated standard differed from the previous version in two important ways in addition to having much improved alarms: the updated alarm sounds are downloadable, and the standard contains extensive guidance and help for researchers, designers and manufacturers in terms of developing and evaluating alarms. 

  

 **2.  Updating and improving the audible alarms in IEC 60601\-1\-8** 

 The updated alarm signals are available to download from the standard body’s website for immediate implementation by manufacturers and other stakeholders such as medical human factors and medical engineering specialists \[5.1\]. These are of direct benefit to manufacturers as they can now, for the first time, incorporate the alarms directly as .wav files into their equipment. In the longer term, the alarms will benefit patients, clinical staff, and guests, as the alarms are less aversive and can be played more quietly; clinicians find them more memorable and localizable, and less fatiguing, than the old alarms \(all evident from the research, section 2\).  Prof Edworthy wrote the majority of the narrative, tables and figures in the standard relating to the acoustic and temporal specifications of the new alarms \[5.2\]. The website Prevention.com \(upwards of 5M monthly unique users per month \(October, 2020\)\) selected the development of the new alarms as one of its ten health breakthrough awards for 2019 \[5.3\]. 

  

 **2. Improving the audible alarm guidance in IEC 60601\-1\-8** 

 For the first time, the standard contains information allowing medical device manufacturers to develop their own alarm signals, as well as their own alarm and risk categories. Annex H \(pp.100\-105\) in the standard\) is mostly written by Prof Edworthy.<sup>b</sup>  A  table  in Annex H contains all relevant metrics concerning the alarms incorporated into the new standard, as follows: 

-  A table \(H1\) delineating learnability, localizability and other performance metrics for the alarms specified, generated from the published papers, for manufacturers to compare with their own designs \(as they must demonstrate comparable performance if they wish to implement their own alarms\) 

-  Detailed advice describing how in\-house designs might be developed and tested for learnability, localizability, detectability, and performance in simulation, based on simplified versions of some of the procedures used in the relevant published papers 

-  Advice as to how new or different categories of risk might be generated in a meaningful and empirical way \(based on an AAMI\-funded study involving Prof Edworthy, directed by Dr Melanie Wright of Trinity Health, Boise, ID, US\). 

  

 The beneficiaries of this improved guidance are medical device manufacturers, human factors and auditory specialists, sound designers, testing houses, and other writers of clinical safety guidance documents and policy \(see 3 and 4 below\).  Dave Osborn, the chair of the three interconnected committees, says ‘ *This standard affects ALL medical equipment worldwide that is either patient connected or controls the flow of energy into or out a patient in all environments …Professor Edworthy has driven all of this work, from the project’s initiation to the recruitment of other key scientists in the area in order to carry out both the formative and the summative testing of the candidate alarm signals in increasingly realistic settings, such as simulated, task sharing environments. Professor Edworthy has also written significant parts of the standard’* \[5.4\]. In his letter he also summarises the likely long\-term beneficiaries of the update to the standard, including patients. 

  

 **3. Working with industry \(policy change, tools, understanding, process\)** 

 Prof Edworthy has worked extensively with two medical instrument companies, Masimo Inc \(based in Irvine, CA, USA\) and Kestra Inc \(based in Seattle, WA, USA\) and has less formal connections with other companies.  Masimo makes non\-invasive sensors which are currently used by over 100 million patients each year <sup>e</sup> Prof Edworthy has worked with a UK sound designer \(Henry Daw, London\) also working with Masimo, from 2018 onwards to develop alarms in improving audible alarms which comply with the standard. They have developed a new version of the ‘general’ alarm sound specified in the standard to make it distinctive to Masimo.  Nicholas Barker, VP of Design at Masimo, says ‘ *Professor Edworthy’s expertise has allowed our company to prepare for the publishing of the update of IEC 60601\-1\-8 during the year 2020…The insights and advice Professor Edworthy have provided allow Masimo to enhance its leading role in the industry and to meet its high standards for consumer satisfaction and patient safety* \[5.5\]. 

  

 \[text removed for publication\] \[5.6\]. 

  

1.  **Working with key designers and research teams** 

 A key benefit of the new standard is that it allows manufacturers to develop new categories of risk and new types of alarms, and provides them with benchmarking data with which to compare their own designs, if they wish to do more than download the sounds already provided \(see 1 above\).  Prof Edworthy has worked with various design and research groups to expedite this process. For example, a project is underway within the Human Factors group at Lisbon University, who say ‘ *In our project funded by the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation, we are designing clinical alarms with the goal of creating a library of sounds that will be made available and that ultimately would benefit manufacturers who would be able to choose them for their devices. For this we are using the IEC 60601\-1\-8 as design tool and its alarms as best\-case scenario baseline.’\[5.7\].*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Joining Technology Research Centre \(JTRC\) has provided substantial and critical knowledge transfer to YASA Limited \(Oxford, UK\), centred on the introduction of engineered polymer materials \(EPMs\) for reducing the weight of high\-powered lightweight electric motors, designed and manufactured by YASA. Key achievements over two successful knowledge transfer partnerships \(KPTs\) included: 

-  Improvement of the motor that enabled YASA to radically shorten production times, save material used and reduce defect rate, leading to significant cost reductions in motor production, and preparing the company for mass production. 

-  Increased high\-profile client base, through data driven assurance of motor performance, creation of assembly protocols, improved build robustness and reliability, and increased power demand potential of the motor. 

-  Development of new joining processes \(patented technology\) to accommodate the introduction of EPMs. This led to investigations for alternative novel cooling mechanisms that drove key strategic decisions for future motor design. 

-  Generation of predicative numerical tools to determine noise and vibration reductions for future motor development and diversification of motor applications, as a direct result of employing EPMs. 

 This all represented a huge step change for the company, leading to the successful mass production of subsequent YASA motor models, their take up in high\-profile companies \[text removed for publication\] and signing multiple long\-term development and supply agreements with automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer \(OEM\) customers, paving the way towards its inclusion in lower cost electric\-driven production vehicles.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The collaborative research and knowledge exchange between the Joining Technology Research Centre \(JTRC\) at Oxford Brookes University and YASA Motors involved three key technical strands: \(1\) adhesive development for dissimilar material joining; \(2\) novel heat exchange concepts; and \(3\) predictive dynamic modelling. 

 YASA, the Oxford based manufacturer of electric motors and motor controllers for use in automotive and industrial applications, was founded in 2009 by the CTO, Dr Tim Woolmer, to commercialise a permanent\-magnet axial\-flux electric motor \(YASA stands for Yokeless and Segmented Armature\). Having magnetic poles aligned axially enabled for a much narrower compact design that was also, and uniquely, liquid cooled. YASA electric motors typically are half the size and a third of the weight of conventional radial motors, including simpler manufacturing and integration processes. However, the construction of early prototypes was hand\-built, slow and expensive to produce, with a high fail rate, which led to considerable inefficiencies. A critical aspect to the novel motor design and significant contributor to these reported issues was the fact that almost the entire assembly of the motor relied upon adhesive bonding. 

 Professor James Broughton’s \(Head of JTRC\) underpinning work on adhesive joint design **\[3.1\]**, fatigue endurance **\[3.2\]** and durability test\-rig development **\[3.3\]** were all directly applicable to tackling the above issues. YASA approached JTRC in 2011, due to their knowledge and expertise, and access to specific equipment for solving joining issues related to lightweight composite materials. Specifically, JTRC were contacted to help develop YASA’s in\-house knowledge and capabilities related to adhesive technology, which led to the first KTP, entitled ‘Development of sustainable joining technologies for the mass manufacture of high reliability, high torque, low mass electric motors’ \(KTP008367, 2011–2013, GBP106,890\), funded by Technology Strategy Board \(TSB, now Innovate UK\). 

 Under the Principal Lead of Professor Allan Hutchinson, Head of Sustainable Vehicle Engineering Centre \(SVEC\), and supervision of Professor \(then Dr\) James Broughton, Head of JTRC, the partnership achieved several key objectives. These included: \(i\) new manufacturing process rules to reduce assembly errors; \(ii\) an improved bonding process that led to a reduction in potential defects \(motor robustness\); and \(iii\) a reduction in motor production times by implementing detailed design modifications that eliminated time\-consuming and expensive rework. In turn, this contributed to a significant reduction in the cost of the motor **\[3.4\]**. For future high\-volume production models, utilising lightweight ‘injection moulded’ engineered polymer materials \(EPM\) will lead to more sustainable motor designs with greater potential for recycling at end\-of\-life. Work was undertaken to investigate co\-bonding of EPMs using laser and heat welding technologies, and their effects on bond performance and durability; many of these materials exhibit low surface energies, which can translate to poor adhesion if not treated. This work developed solutions involving co\-bonding and over\-moulding technique innovations and led to the filing of three patents. The outcomes of this work received significant national recognition as the award\-winning KTP for Engineering Excellence and runner\-up finalist in the Best of the Best Award, Innovate UK, 2014. 

 The introduction of EPMs, however, had negative consequences, including increased noise, vibration and poor heat extraction. A follow\-on KTP project was formed, entitled ‘Development of a prototype axial flux motor using novel cooling technologies with the aim of providing a step change \(30%\) in power output’ \(KTP009387, 2013–2015, GBP94,587\), funded by TSB and under the joint supervision of Professor Broughton and Dr Stephen Samuel. Analytical models developed by Dr Samuel on heat transfer of IC engines **\[3.5\]** formed the basis for specialised models for optimising cooling and heat flow dynamics. One of the options explored was heat pipe technology \(HPT\) because of its simplicity and compactness. Experimentation evaluated various wick types and cooling fluid types to validate the models. The research delivered 12 technical reports on experimental, theoretical and numerical investigations into flow rates, coolant systems and fluids, wetting of wicks for heat pipes, and dynamics of heat flow **\[3.6\]**. Although the overall outcome established that HPT was not currently a viable option, the findings informed company strategy and diverted significant R&D resource to other areas. Preliminary frequency analyses also demonstrated limitations with the current aluminium cover of the YASA P400, leading to a sponsored PhD on the dynamics of certain motor components. This work immediately identified issues with the dynamic response of some motors and further issues that could arise with the introduction of EPMs for light\-weighting purposes. This work continues to guide YASA’s implementation of EPMs and re\-design of the motor to reduce noise levels and improve dynamic response.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Joining Technology Research Centre at Oxford Brookes University has been the source of invaluable expertise for YASA Motors. Two successful KTPs led to a significant increase in the technical and commercial capabilities of YASA and further contribution towards a lower carbon economy. 

 Currently, most of YASAs production of motors and controllers resides in the automotive sector, enabling automotive manufacturers to meet increasingly stringent emissions targets whilst delivering exciting driving experiences. In addition to automotive applications, YASA motors are used in defence, marine and aerospace sectors where high power density and torque density are critical. All these markets demand highly reliable, lightweight and robust motors, given the extreme environments these types of vehicles operate within. In 2018, YASA officially opened its 100,000 unit motor production facility. The Business Secretary, Greg Clark MP, who delivered the opening address said, “ *YASA is a brilliant example of what can be achieved when government, academia and industry come together to turn the best ideas from the best minds into scale\-up companies*” **\[5.1\]**. YASA is now well\-placed to capture significant market share within these sectors too and a significant aspect of this is down to the robust bonding technologies and company knowledge gained through the unique, on\-going, relationship fostered between Oxford Brookes University and YASA. 

 Initially, the partnership was sought to provide the capability to make high torque, low mass motors using injection moulding polymers with adhesive/composite bonds. Prior to the KTP project with JTRC, YASA lacked adhesive joining expertise, particularly relating to the design of interfaces and bonding of composite parts to proposed low surface energy polymers, as well as expertise in choosing or designing test methods suitable for testing such bonds against environmental and mechanical stresses, all needed for scaling to mass manufacture **\[5.5\]**. 

 With the first KTP focused primarily on production issues, there have been several significant impacts on the business. Dr Tim Woolmer, Founder and CTO, YASA Limited remarked, “ *The combination of expertise and equipment had attracted us to the KTP – but everyone here has been blown away by the results*” **\[5.2\]**. These main technological impacts were first introduced in 2013, where the company at the time recorded a revenue of GBP1,600,000. Issues directly linked to the bonding process were resolved, which meant defect\-rates had fallen by a factor of 100, saving almost GBP100,000 in avoidance of motor durability failures. The KTP Associate Jonny Biddulph conducted trials of new technology on injection moulded stator plates, where the outcome was a part\-cost reduced from GBP177 to GBP7. With two of these parts included in every motor this represented a significant saving \(GBP1,140,000 for 3,000 motors\) and allowed the joining of neighbouring parts by laser welding, further increasing manufacturing speed. The manufacturing process time reduced from 7 days to 2 days, potentially saving GBP16,650,000 \(reduced assembly time savings GBP18.50/hour production cost, based on predicted 90,000hours saved three years after completion of KTP\) **\[5.3\]**. From Oxford Brookes University’s first involvement with YASA in 2011, the company grew from 12 to \~150 employees in 2020, with a recorded revenue of GBP7,600,000 in 2018 **\[5.4\]**. This growth has been necessary to extend production rates from less than 50 motors per annum to a high volume capability of 100,000 units per annum **\[5.1\]**. This capability would not be possible without the key technology to deliver high\-volume over\-moulded bonded stator plates. 

 This KTP has subsequently proven instrumental to sustaining the growth of YASA Motors in the areas of materials and bonding technologies. On the back of demonstrating robust bonding procedures, the motors were adopted for the Jaguar C\-X75 supercar, dubbed ‘ *the most technologically advanced road car ever conceived*’, and on the strength of this YASA were shortlisted for the Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders \(SMMT\) Award for Automotive Innovation **\[5.6\]**. Other high\-end sports cars have since adopted the technology, proving its capabilities in demanding environments. For example, the \[text removed for publication\] uses three YASA motors and, according to \[text removed for publication\], delivers the fastest accelerating, most powerful production car ever. \[text removed for publication\] commented: “ *YASA’s motors are extremely power dense, making them the key\-ingredient for the direct drive system. The torque capability of the YASA motors combined with our world\-leading engineering expertise has given the* \[text removed for publication\] *an acceleration capability that is second to none*” **\[5.7\]**. \[text removed for publication\], like many other OEMs are now also heavily investing in hybrid and electric vehicles, and have integrated seven P400 motors in their new \[text removed for publication\] supercar **\[5.8\]**. YASA electric motors also power \[text removed for publication\] first hybrid series production sports car, the \[text removed for publication\]. YASA have been working closely with \[text removed for publication\], developing a custom version of its electric motor that meets \[text removed for publication\] demanding performance specifications. The \[text removed for publication\] was launched by \[text removed for publication\] on 29 May 2019, in \[text removed for publication\] **\[5.9\]**. Such projects are often the proving grounds for the adoption of new technologies into more mainstream vehicles. 

 As a direct result of the KTP and the strategy to develop high volume production motors, three key international patents were filed by YASA and the Oxford Brookes University KTP research assistant. Patent EP3044854: Stator Plate Over\-moulding \(2014\) involved placing a resin membrane into a mould of an injection\-moulding machine and injection moulding a set of reinforcing features onto the membrane using a bondable thermoplastic polymer **\[5.10\]**. Patent EP3044849: Pole Piece Bonding \(2014\) uses similar technology for bonding the pole pieces using a flexible resin membrane. The resin membrane, which may contain woven glass fibre reinforcement, may be an engineering polymer material \(e.g. PPA, PEEK, PPS, ABS, PA\) wherein reinforcement inhibits the stator bars from pushing through the membrane. An additional thermoplastic polymer resin is used for supplementary bonding injection moulded reinforcing features **\[5.11\]**. Due to the high rotational rotor speeds that generate large centripetal forces on the rotor stages, particularly on surface mounted magnets, any loss of magnet adhesion is a risk for this motor topology. In order to combat this issue a third Patent, EP2773023: Axial Flux Motor \(2013\), was filed. It introduced a composite rotor for the axial flux motor, wherein the rotor holds permanent magnets circumferentially spaced around the rotor. An over\-winding of strands of reinforcement material are toroidally\-wound over the rotor and magnets. The strands help strengthen the rotor and provide a lightweight and high performance product **\[5.12\]**. Together, the technology behind these patents helped deliver the third generation P400 motors. 

 The technical transition towards the launch of the P400 R from earlier models is consistent with the dramatic increase in demand for low carbon emission technologies, driven by legislation and motivated by climate change. The P400 R Series is now manufactured using advanced materials and proprietary construction techniques that enable high\-volume production with significant customer cost benefits. An important innovation of the P400 R Series is the use of an engineering polymer housing for the motor stator, in place of the aluminium housing used in earlier models. The performance of engineered polymer material is strong, highly durable and lightweight, and is already in common use in volume automotive applications \(not motors\). Importantly, the materials used in the P400 R Series reduce both material cost and assembly time, the direct legacy of the first KTP. The low weight of the new polymer housing also helps to improve the overall motor performance **\[5.13\]**. Lightweighting also has secondary benefits that include reduced wear on components, reduced maintenance and an extension of service life. 

 Oxford Brookes University’s contribution to the development of these electric motors for mass production puts UK industry at a significant advantage to deliver on Government targets for total electrification of transport by 2050. An example of the broader reach of this technology includes the application of electric motors in the \[text removed for publication\] hovercraft, as bow thrusters to provide reversible sideways thrust for craft manoeuvring at low speed. With minimal modification, two YASA P400 motors were incorporated into the design of the hovercraft. The principal benefit of using YASA electric motors was that two of the four diesel engines could be eliminated from the design. This reduced the noise levels from the engines significantly, without adversely affecting the reliability of the craft **\[5.14\]**. Likewise, \[text removed for publication\] has completed testing of the ground\-breaking technology that will power the world’s fastest all\-electric plane. The plane is part of a \[text removed for publication\] initiative called ACCEL, short for ‘Accelerating the Electrification of Flight’. The ACCEL project team includes YASA as key partners along with the aviation start\-up Electroflight **\[5.15\]**. 

 The knowledge gained from the underpinning work with OBU to enable lightweight EPMs to be used effectively, has greatly assisted YASA to supply motors to production electric vehicles, owned by mainstream OEMs **\[5.16\]**. OEMs that have been associated with YASA products include \[text removed for publication\] **\[5.1\]**. Without robust assembly technologies and the ability to bond a multitude of different lightweight materials, the YASA motor could not supply a volume production unit of the highest quality demanded by OEMs. Indeed, without high quality bonding methods and procedures, the motor could not deliver on the performance required for today’s transport requirements, let alone meet the future global transportation needs.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Foster has equipped industry with enhanced theoretical understanding and modelling capabilities that, in the words of \[text removed for publication\] \(S1\), have provided ""significant economic benefit"" by decreasing ""overall development cost"" of manufacturing battery modules for electric vehicles \(EVs\). The lithium\-ion battery \(LIB\) industry is currently worth USD40 billion per year, predicted to be USD92 billion per year by 2024. The impact has primarily been realised via changing practices at GM who are increasing their investment in LIBs to >USD27 billion and plan to produce and sell >1,000,000 EVs in 2025. 

 Foster's work contributes to increased rates of adoption of EVs by enhancing commercial viability of the LIB packs which comprise \~40% of the cost of the EV. These batteries are longer\-lasting, safer, charge more quickly, and can be driven further between recharges. This is significant in the context of policies to ban the sale of combustion engines across large portions of the world over coming decades \(e.g., UK Road to Zero policy\). It will make a major contribution towards societal goals to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>, NOx and particulate emissions mitigating climate change and reducing the effects of other pollutants on human health. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since joining Portsmouth in June 2016, Foster has extensively researched LIBs in collaboration with **General Motors Global R&D** \(GM\) staff and GM\-funded researchers at **McMaster University**. Foster also works under the auspices of the **Faraday Institution**, a key part of the UK Government's Industrial Challenge. 

 EVs are seen as part of the solution for two of the four Grand Challenges in the UK’s Industrial Strategy: *helping reduce carbon emissions and generating clean growth* and *changing the future of mobility*. The switch to EVs is recognised as crucial to meet the UK’s net zero emissions target by 2050. LIBs are a key component of EVs. They are the technology of choice due to their high energy density \(up to 265 watt\-hours per kg; around 7 times the density of traditional lead\-acid batteries\) and have high power densities. Customer hesitation in adoption of EVs arises from several issues, chief amongst them being \(i\) **lifetime** *,* the warranty period for LIB packs is typically quoted as 100,000 miles or 10 years \(ii\) **\(dis\)charge rates,** the relatively long time required to “refuel” EVs is tens of minutes rather than a few minutes for combustion engine vehicles and \(iii\) **capacity** *,* the limited range per recharge. The battery comprises \~25% of an EV’s weight and accounts for \~40% of its cost, making it arguably the most important component. Increases in battery energy/power density will reduce their weight, meaning longer range. Reducing battery degradation will extend useful lifetime, directly reducing cost to consumers and reducing environmental harm from disposal and recycling of EVs. Such improvements are achieved through better design, underpinned by powerful modelling and simulation tools, and also have the knock\-on effect of reducing environmental harm due to disposal and recycling of EVs. Foster’s expertise and individual research contribution \(mathematical modelling\) complements that of his collaborators for outputs \(R1\-6\) who are non\-mathematicians \(chemists, engineers, practitioners\) plus a pure mathematician. 

 <ins> **Impact strand 1: Lifetime extension \(R2, R4, R5, R8\)**</ins> 

 Batteries are repeatedly cycled \(charged and discharged\) over their lifetime, and their microscale mechanics plays an important role in their degradation. However due to LIBs’ highly complex morphology, changes can be difficult to quantify meaningfully. Motivated by state\-of\-the\-art Scanning Electron Microscope \(SEM\) images harvested by the GM funded imaging group at McMaster \(Canadian Centre for Electron Microscopy\), Foster’s contribution \(R8\) was to quantify changes that occur within batteries as they are cycled \(Fig. 1, left\). The team then developed an approach \(using systematic homogenization\) where microscopy images of real battery electrodes with a complicated structure are distilled down to a set of scalar measures \(effective transport properties\) that can be tracked over time \(R8\). It is now possible to precisely quantify the effects of battery use throughout their lifetimes. We can also identify operating protocols and designs that enhance battery health and lifetime. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 Foster’s subsequent work exploited these tools to develop a modelling framework that can not only assess but also predict in advance which novel device designs and manufacturing processes will yield LIBs better able to withstand structural damage \(Fig. 1, right\). Since damage reduces performance and lifetime, it is of major concern to GM and the LIB industry at large. Foster, funded by \(G1\), designed the physics\-based models to allow specific recommendations to be made on \(a\) the shape and material properties of internal components and \(b\) the manufacturing processes required to mitigate structural fatigue and extend usable lifetimes \(R2, R4, R5\).

 <ins> **Impact strand 2: Improved \(dis\)charge rates \(R1, R3, R4, R7\)**</ins> 

 The electrolyte \(an ionic liquid\) provides the transport pathway for Li\-ions between the anode and cathode. For \(dis\)charge to be sustained, the electrolyte must transport ions at the rate required by the current draw. Foster formulated novel models to account for ion\-pairing effects and dendrite formation in these ionic liquids, motivated by two important goals: \(i\) designing electrolytes with improved transport capabilities for use in high\-rate cells, and \(ii\) avoiding lithium dendrite formation which can cause short\-circuiting and, in extreme cases, thermal runaway and catastrophic explosion \(R1, R3, R7\). Foster has developed optimisation strategies that alleviate a bottleneck in LIB production: electrode drying. LIB electrodes are prepared by applying a coating \(of a slurry containing the electrode components\) onto a metallic film current collector. This is then dried to remove solvent. There is a commercial incentive to maximise throughput using high rate drying. However, this leads to detrimental heterogeneous internal structures. In \(R4\) a novel model is used to elucidate the physical mechanisms driving the heterogeneity formation, leading to recommendations on smart drying protocols that can speed up drying without damaging electrode performance. 

 <ins> **Impact strand 3: Capacity increases \(R3, R6\)**</ins> 

 More recent work has focussed on the atomic structure of the metal\-oxides used as the primary active component of the majority of LIB cathodes on the market today. Informed by experimental data provided by co\-authors \(R6\), Foster developed a computational algorithm for predicting the arrangement of atoms within these materials, enabling more focused interrogation of existing material structures than can be conducted through experiment alone. The resulting improvements in theoretical understanding reveal which features of the atomic arrangements correlate directly with enhanced electrochemical performance. These features can then be incorporated into future material designs \(R6\). An industrially\-relevant strategy for increasing battery capacity is to increase electrode thickness. However this makes Li\-ion transport pathways longer, as they navigate between electrodes, hampering high rate discharge. Foster modelled the bespoke charging protocols investigated in \(R3\) that partially overcome this difficulty, showing that a brief current reversal during \(dis\)charge helps utilise more fully the capacity of such electrodes. 

 <ins> **Impact strand 4: Battery simulation tools**</ins> 

 Many of the modelling techniques that Foster developed are embedded within an extremely fast linear\-scaling code \( **DandeLiion**\) which solves the most ubiquitous electrochemical battery model \(the Newman model\). Foster designed and created the first version, and has continued to provide technical supervision throughout its subsequent development. Owing to DandeLiion's speed and power, others can now perform computations on composite batteries and modules that are not possible on other platforms. DandeLiion provides a digital twin of real batteries allowing industry to cheaply and quickly benchmark novel designs, saving significant development time and money. Foster is being supported by the Faraday Institution to form a spin out company to export DandeLiion across academia and industry as a commercial product \( [<ins>www.dandeliion.com</ins>](http://www.dandeliion.com/)\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The developments above were achieved since Foster joined UoP in June 2016 and have led to improved processes and products within GM, innovation with the Faraday Institution and at McMaster University, and a state\-of\-the\-art software tool now used by practitioners internationally. 

 <ins> **From research to impact**</ins> 

 **General Motors** manufactures batteries, employs 164,000 people and serves 6 continents. GM is the first company to mass\-produce an affordable EV, the Chevrolet Bolt. Its EVs have been driven 4,200,000,000km, saving 159,000,000l of gasoline and avoiding 312,000t of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per year. GM's commitment to the EV market is evidenced by their joint investment \(with LG Chem\) of USD2.3 billion in the EV plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and planned production of 20 new EV models by 2023. The health of the relationship between Foster and GM is evidenced by five joint publications \(including R1, R2, R6, R8\) with GM scientists and a further two \(including R3, R4\) directly funded by GM in leading energy journals. 

 **McMaster University** has a long\-standing relationship with GM. For 8 years GM has funded research at McMaster \(with the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada\) with an investment of \~CAD8,000,000. Foster is a named collaborator on the most recent renewal of this grant \(G3\). He supervises GM\-funded Postdoctoral Researchers \(Drs William Ko, Jose Escalante, Francesc Font and Lindsey Daniels\), via his adjunct position at McMaster. 

 **The Faraday Institution** \(FI\) is the UK’s independent body for electrochemical energy storage research, skills development, market analysis, and early\-stage commercialisation, and acts as a conduit between academia and industry. Foster secured over GBP230,000 from FI \(G2\) since 2019 and is supported by them to set up a spin\-out company around the DandeLiion software. 

 <ins> **Nature and extent of impact strand 1: Lifetime extension**</ins> 

 Beneficiaries of longer\-lifetime and more reliable EVs include industry, motorists and the environment through reduced disposal/recycling. Foster's experimentally\-validated model of mechanical changes \(R5\) equipped GM with the means to test novel designs in\-silico without costly and time\-consuming prototyping: \[text removed for publication\] this work “sheds light on the microstructural changes of the battery electrode during cycling. These changes are strongly linked to battery degradation mechanisms and this work has \[…\] opened new avenues for ameliorating these changes, and thereby helped us extend cell life\-time” \(S1\). Altering the drying step provided further lifetime extension techniques \(and monetary savings\) \[text removed for publication\]. It is crucial to estimate a device’s state\-of\-health so that it is removed from service when needed. Improperly judging this can lead to internal short\-circuits and, potentially, catastrophic explosion. “Our work with Foster… has been crucial in helping us understand, and accurately model, several key aspects of Li\-ion battery operation and has significantly increased the impact of our work.” \(S2\). Foster’s framework provided better state\-of\-health estimates enabling timely replacement/repair to prevent unexpected failures \(R8\). The framework led to a model that supported the GM scientific team “to understand the electrode conductivity evolution during battery cycling. This is an indicator of battery health and this work has helped us understand how to assess health in situ” \(S1\). 

 <ins> **Nature and extent of impact strand 2: Improved \(dis</ins><ins>\)</ins><ins>charge rates**</ins> 

 Faster charging batteries remove a major deterrent for potential EV consumers who want a ‘greener’ mode of transport, with knock\-on benefits to the environment \(through CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction\), and human health in urban areas \(by reducing other pollutants\). \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 <ins> **Nature and extent of impact strand 3: Capacity increases**</ins> 

 Higher capacity batteries last longer between recharges, benefitting consumers, transport operators, as well as the industry. Foster “developed… the tool that is required to synthesise higher capacity materials, which will further improve the energy density of Li\-ion batteries. For automotive applications the increase of the energy density is of the utmost importance” \(S2\). \[Text removed for publication\]. Increasing electrode thickness is a key strategy for GM to manufacture enhanced capacity anodes for EVs. \[Text removed for publication\]. Thus Foster’s research has led to batteries that are not only more efficient, better maintained and longer lasting, but also safer for the consumer. 

 <ins> **Nature and extent of impact strand 4: Battery simulation tools**</ins> 

 
A major fruit of Foster's work is the ultra\-fast LIB simulation tool, DandeLiion, which is now used by academia and industry internationally. The Faraday Institution is supporting commercialisation via a spin\-out company. Having originally been identified by Faraday Institution due to a need for his coding expertise, Foster’s subsequent research presentation to a panel of UK captains of industry was met with enthusiasm for the formation of a spin\-out. \[Text removed for publication\]. DandeLiion’s impact to date can be quantified and evidenced by >300 jobs already executed by academic and industrial users internationally \(Fig. 2\) on its dedicated server \(dandeliion.com, S4\). \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 *Figure 2 \(Right\): Geographic reach of DandeLiion: Blue shows active users \[Google analytics\].* 

 <ins> **Summary**</ins> 

 Foster’s research at UoP has armed industry worldwide with enhanced theory, modelling capability and state\-of\-the art software, that drives down development costs and ""has numerous knock\-on effects, including by decreasing the waste stream and the burden of recycling” \(S1\). The work benefits consumers because improved EV batteries are cheaper, safer, longer\-lasting, charge more quickly, and can be driven further between recharges. Economic benefits have been delivered to a huge industry \(already worth USD40 billion per year and set to experience significant growth\). This industry’s growth rate and success are crucial in achieving CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions in the UK and internationally.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The climate and biodiversity crisis shows that people’s relationships with nature are breaking down. Researchers at the University of Derby \(UoD\) have transformed the way people interact with nature to improve wellbeing and promote pro\-nature behaviour, by developing the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’, a behaviour change framework that focuses on experiencing rather than mastering nature. The National Trust, Wildlife Trust, European Forest Therapy Institute, and the New Zealand Government Department of Conservation \(DOC\) have all made improvements to their policy and practice by adopting the framework, which has improved the wellbeing of the public. The creation of the Nature Connection Index \(NCI\) allowed Natural England to gain a population measure of the UK’s relationship with nature. The United Nations \(UN\) reviewed the framework, and it has influenced the development of the UN’s post\-2020 Biodiversity Framework.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Nature Connectedness Research Group \(NCRG\) was established at UoD in 2013 and has produced over 30 peer\-reviewed journal articles and received over £300,000 in external research funding \[G3.1, G3.2\]. In 2018, Universities UK recognised their work as one of the UK’s best 100 breakthroughs for research impact. The group is led by M. Richardson, core researchers include D. Sheffield, R. Lumber and K. McEwan. The group conducts behavioural research including: 

 ● A multi\-study project \(2013–16\) on the development of the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’, has identified and operationalised five types of activity and relationships that improve people’s nature connectedness \[3.1\]. The foundational idea took Kellert’s nine values of biophillia from 1993 and identified those that improve nature connectedness through cross\-sectional research and final empirical testing. The pathways provide a unique framework for designing nature connectedness interventions, from visitor programming to green infrastructure design. 

 ● Development and evaluations of interventions to improve mental wellbeing and pro\-environmental behaviours by increasing nature connectedness. The research group worked with the Wildlife Trust to use the pathways in the design of the annual ‘30 Days Wild campaign’ \(2015–20\). Yearly evaluations have shown significant improvements in nature connection, health, happiness and conservation behaviours sustained for two months. An evaluation of 273 people who took part in the campaign identified specific groups within the population that benefitted most \[3.2\]. The clear rationale, theoretical basis, delivery, content and focus on defined outcomes, met criteria for public health interventions. 

 ● In 2016, a low\-cost intervention to improve nature connectedness was trialled with 92 participants; approximately half had to note three good things in nature every day \(intervention\) and were compared with the remainder who noted three factual things every day \(control\) \[3.3\]. The intervention group showed sustained and significant increases in nature connectedness compared to the control group. Increases in nature connectedness were associated with psychological health improvement in the intervention group. This research provided evidence that paying attention and noting the good things in nature each day can deliver sustained increases in people’s connection with nature. 

 ● An RCT \(n=582\) of a nature connectedness green prescription app \[3.4, G3.1\] based on noticing the good things in urban nature delivered clinically significant improvements in mental health. Providing everyday opportunities to improve wellbeing through engaging with urban nature using a brief, portable, widely accessible and cost\-effective smartphone app intervention is valuable new knowledge. 

 ● A key benefit of nature connectedness is pro\-nature behaviours. Although there are several measures of pro\-environmental behaviours \(broadly carbon/resource use\) related to climate warming, there were no psychometric scales to measure pro\-nature conservation behaviours \(broadly habitat creation or protection\) related to the crisis of biodiversity loss. Therefore, the NCRG developed the first scale to measure these behaviours \[3.5\] which subsequent research showed were increased by improved nature connectedness. 

 ● Psychometric scale development with the Nature Connection Index \(NCI\): a new population measure of nature connectedness developed for national statistical research \[3.6\]. To establish the reliability of the new Nature Connection Index \(NCI\) three factor analyses were conducted. One was based on a large Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment \(MENE\) dataset for adults \(n=3568\) with replication using datasets collected online \(n=553\), and a third used MENE data from children \(n=351\). MENE \(now called the People and Nature Survey\) was part of the UK’s national statistics and uses the robust protocols required when collecting data to inform policy. The results showed that the NCI was a reliable and valid scale for both children and adults, and they gave insights into the links between nature connectedness and pro\-nature behaviours.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Nature Connectedness is a recent psychological construct that benefits mental wellbeing and pro\-environmental behaviours. Researchers at UoD, led by Richardson, have discovered ways to improve nature connectedness that have changed the practices of UK \[5.1, 5.2, 5.3\] and European organisations \[5.4\] and the New Zealand government \[5.5\]. The research has also informed the implementation and evaluation of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ \(DEFRA’s\) 25 Year Environment Plan and Natural England’s 5\-year policy in the UK \[5.6, 5.7\]. It also influenced approaches to mental wellbeing in the UK and Europe \[5.8, 5.9\], and has been adopted by the UN \[5.10\]. 

 **Using the pathways framework to engage people, improve wellbeing and increase pro\-nature behaviours** 

 Research by Lumber *et al*. \[3.1\] identified the types of activity that led to improved nature connectedness in the ‘Pathways to Nature Connectedness’. The Wildlife Trust used the pathways to design and organise the ‘Random Acts of Wildness’ activities as part of their innovative ‘30 Days Wild’ national programme \[5.1\] which has run from 2015 to the present. Evaluations evidenced sustained improvements in happiness, health, nature connectedness and pro\-environmental behaviours \[5.1\] and over one million people have taken part over 5 years \[5.1\]. The greatest impact was among people who began the programme with lower nature connectedness \[5.1\]. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Following the success of the Wildlife Trust’s campaign, in 2018, the National Trust asked Richardson to produce an internal report introducing the evidence base for the benefits of nature connectedness. This resulted in the organisation embedding NCRG pathways into their practice and strategic vision for outdoor experience programming, which was available to the National Trust’s 6 million members and 25 million visitors from 2018 \[5.2\]. The Trust organised a series of workshops with staff who were responsible for the visitor experience, facilitated by videos and guidance on the pathways by UoD. One part of this work was a refresh of the national campaign ‘50 things to do before you’re 11<sup>3/4</sup>’ launched in Spring 2019, which activated the pathways to nature connectedness amongst children. The pathways approach will also form the basis of the new Easter 2021 programming. 

 The new ‘50 Things’ campaign was implemented in at least 270 properties and led to a 405% increase in web traffic and engagement and has shown a positive impact on visitors’ nature connection as well as enrichment of the visitor experience overall \[5.2\]. A National Trust Project Manager remarked: <sup>“</sup> *The \[UoD\] research has really helped the National Trust find ways to encourage visitors to connect to nature and therefore our places in new and more meaningful ways. For the staff it has given a clear framework for how to shape activities to provide richer and more immersive experiences, transforming garden tours, ranger days, dawn chorus events, season long programs, national campaigns \(like ‘50 things’\) and everything else in\-between. For some this has been a considerable shift from a knowledge\-based approach to a more personal one, but many have adopted it with enthusiasm and the emerging results have been transformational. For visitors, the change in approach to these activities has helped them to see our places in a new way, develop much deeper appreciation and connection, and ultimately inspiring them to want to care for nature in a better way”* \[5.2\]. The National Trust Head of Insight remarked: “ *The work on Pathways, translated into practical guidance for our teams, has resulted in a transformation in how we design nature experiences, as well as our ‘on property programming…’*” It has been, “ *a positive cultural change*”. Furthermore, the approach: “… *had a dramatic impact into our wider communications…* \[We\] *…have translated the principles of the pathways into operational guidance, as well as a language guide on nature communications.*” Additionally, it: “… *significantly shifted the focus of our marketing and communications teams … inspiring creativity for our in\-house marketing teams to deliver a more profound and purpose\-led approach to engaging people with nature at a time of crisis. We took this further through a high\-profile TV advertising campaign, which again, founded on principles and evidence we established through our work with the team at Derby”* \[5.2\]. 

 More organisations across the UK are now using UoD research to inform their work, including: the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \(RSPB\), to inform their evaluation and engagement work \[5.3\] and their ‘nature prescription’ offer in Scotland \[5.3\]; the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust are using the Pathways as a guiding principle to establish the Trust as a fore\-runner in promoting nature connectedness \[5.3\]; and the Derby Museum, who experienced a 100% increase in exhibit dwell times after UoD research informed new exhibit design \[5.3\]. Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust are using the pathways research to inform organisational guidelines for visitor experience. The Durrell Director of Conservation Science stated: *“In 2017, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust launched its new 2018*– *2025 organisational strategy which put nature connection front and centre of what we do… The Pathways to Nature Connectedness research provides a really useful framework for reframing and designing many of the ways we interact with…people…The Pathways research feeds directly into a set of organisational guidelines”* \[5.3\]. 

 Internationally, the pathways form a key part of the ‘5x5’ Forest Bathing training provided by the European Forest Therapy Institute to influence the practice of 180 practitioners from 30 countries including Turkey, Ireland, UK, USA, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Spain, Portugal, Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia and Costa Rica \[5.4\]. The pathways framework changed the practice of the New Zealand Department for Conservation \(DOC\) who collaborated with the UK National Trust and implemented their own version of the ‘50 things’ campaign \[5.5\]. In an emergency response to the COVID\-19 pandemic, the international charity, SOS Children’s Villages International \(SOS CVI\), used UoD’s ‘good things in nature’ intervention \[3.3, 3.4\] as part of the resources provided to improve the psychological health of their staff, children and community during the lockdown in Italy \[5.8\]. 

 **Influencing policy change in the UK and Internationally** 

 Research conducted by the NCRG has influenced a number of national and international policies for nature, environments and wellbeing. The NCRG worked closely with Natural England to inform the development and evaluation of DEFRA’s 25 Year Environment Plan \[5.6\], published in 2018, which included policy on ‘connecting people with the environment to improve health and wellbeing’. Richardson is an invited member of Natural England’s Strategic Research Committee leading projects such as the validation of the Nature Connections Index \(NCI\) \[3.6\], used for population survey work \[5.7\].  In 2020, nature connectedness was included in Natural England’s new online People and Nature Survey \(formerly the MENE Survey\), the world’s largest survey of people’s interaction with outdoor green spaces, using the UoD\-developed NCI measure \[5.7\]. The UoD\-developed Pro\-nature Conservation Behaviours Scale was also included \[3.5, 5.7\]. The results from this survey provided information on how COVID\-19 affected the population’s relationship with nature. The group’s research is also cited in the September 2019 DEFRA review of National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Beauty and is the only research evidence cited in Natural England’s new 5\-year plan in relation to the aim to connect people with nature \[5.6\]. Nature connectedness now forms a key part of Natural England’s 5\-year plan and is one of the four strategic areas of focus. Richardson also chairs the expert advisory group on the UK Government 25YEP Nature Friendly Schools programme to create nature\-friendly schools. 

 Natural England’s Principal Adviser stated: “ *The insight provided through research led by Derby University into the relationship between nature connection and wellbeing and a range of pro\-environmental and pro\-nature behaviours has made a profound impact on Natural England’s approach to public engagement and the means of evaluating the impact of that engagement work”* \[5.7\]. The impact is further illustrated by the fact that applicants to the Connecting People with Nature stream of the Government’s GBP40,000,000 Green Recovery Challenge Fund \(GRCF\) were directed to work on the pathways to nature connectedness framework in a key part of the funding guidance administered by the National Heritage Lottery Fund \[5.7\]. 

 The charity, Student Minds, used NCRG research \[3.3, 3.4\] to develop the ‘University Mental Health Charter’, launched in 2019 with the support of the Universities Minister, and is currently using the University of Derby as a pilot site to implement the Charter Award Scheme \[5.9\]. A consumer version of the mental health smartphone intervention developed during G3.1 and found to be effective \[3.4\], was released as part of the Go Jauntly App in May 2020. Between launch and 14 August 2020, the app had 30,701 downloads; a 300% increase compared with the 3 months pre\-launch \[5.9\]. Internationally, the DOC implemented NCRG research into their national teacher training course to improve nature connectedness among New Zealand children \[5.5\]. The Outreach and Education Coordinator commented: “ *Since the introduction of the Pathways to Nature Connectedness research into the team, there has been a shift in focus on how we develop and promote nature\-based learning. The research has been a key factor in shaping the strategic direction of DOC’s education engagement from development of resources to promotion campaigns.* *The marketing and social media teams have identified the pathways as a key tool for engaging new and old audiences in national conservation campaigns”* \[5.5\]. 

 Richardson was invited to co\-author the ‘Connecting People with Nature’ \[5.10\] report by the Children & Nature Network, a US non\-profit organisation aimed at improving children’s access and interaction with nature globally. The report was presented at the November 2018 UN Convention on Biological Diversity. This led to a call for the pathways model to be included in the post\-2020 Biodiversity Framework \[5.10\] in order to achieve the UN’s Strategic Plan and Aichi Biodiversity Targets to promote pro\-nature behaviours and improve mental wellbeing.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Green infrastructure, broadly defined as a multifunctional network of green and blue spaces, including measures to achieve flood resilience, is recognised globally as an essential component of healthy, liveable and sustainable places. UWE research between 2013 and 2020 addressed the challenges of defining its quality, planning and delivery. This had impact through the development of a national benchmark for green infrastructure, formal industry guidance, training and techniques, and widespread dissemination of knowledge and practical implementation. Initial development of a local benchmark supported by a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) expanded, with funding from the Natural Environment Research Council, into national benchmarking and support for green infrastructure with the establishment of a new body, *Building with Nature*. This led to the implementation of standards, promoting and supporting best practice on a national scale. Across the UK, benchmarking and accreditation through *Building with Nature* has extended to 30 local authorities, over 30,000 new homes, a hospital and other building developments, and has been promoted by both the UK government and professional bodies. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 There is now a substantial evidence base outlining the benefits of green infrastructure for people and nature \( **R1**, **R2**\). Despite this, it is often challenging to define and deliver high quality green infrastructure, particularly in new developments, and there has been no overarching approach to standards. UWE research between 2013 and 2020 focused on working with stakeholders to understand what the challenges are, how they can be overcome, and developing tools to enable built environment professionals to raise the quality of green infrastructure. 

 The underpinning research revealed: 

-  The long\-term performance, perception and quality of green infrastructure is often compromised due to shortcomings in planning policy, lack of enforcement, poor understanding amongst built environment professions and poor quality delivery of specific features, for example sustainable drainage systems and landscaping \( **G1**, **G2**, **G3**, **R3**, **R4**\); 

-  The importance of articulating the multiple benefits of green infrastructure to secure buy\-in from different sectors and stakeholders \( **G1**\- **G5**, **R1**, **R3**, **R4**\); 

-  That lack of expertise and guidance for planners and other built environment professionals responsible for designing and implementing schemes at building, neighbourhood and city scales, was hampering progress towards the delivery of high\-quality green infrastructure in new developments \( **G1**, **G3**, **G4**, **G5**, **R4**, **R5**, **R6**\); 

-  That it is essential that local communities are involved during planning and maintenance stages of green infrastructure to ensure effective long\-term performance, and that social learning among professionals can overcome barriers to implementation by creating shared knowledge \( **G4**, **G2**, **R3**, **R6**\); 

-  The importance of long\-term maintenance and education activities and the role of different communities and practices in sustainable spaces \( **G4**, **G2**, **R3**, **R6**\); 

-  That existing built environment assessment systems do not adequately address green infrastructure, because they: a\) do not have mandatory requirements for green infrastructure; b\) miss opportunities for the additive benefits that can be provided through a multifunctional network by focussing on individual features; c\) fail to require the delivery of a multifunctional network operating at the landscape\-scale; d\) are awarded design masterplans, failing to recognise that the planned green infrastructure is often not delivered \( **G1**, **G3**, **G4**, **R1**, **R6**, **R7**\); 

-  That, in order to overcome some of the barriers identified above, there was both a need and an appetite for a national benchmark for green infrastructure in the UK \( **G1**, **R6**\). 

 Using this body of research, UWE researchers developed and tested a number of tools to enable professional stakeholders to improve the quality of green infrastructure, including a conceptual model of potential benefits for stormwater management and a methodology for evaluation of green roof retrofit potential in city centres \( **R1**\). Building on this research, a replicable framework for initiating Learning and Action Alliances for setting citywide multi\-stakeholder vision for **G1** was developed in Newcastle \( **G5**, **R6**\) and tested in Ebbsfleet \( **G2**\). In addition, a KTP with Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust supported initial locally\-focused work to develop a new framework of principles, standards and two user guides for policy and new development, and their application to demonstration projects \( **R2**, **G3**, **S1**\). Follow\-on funding from NERC then enabled further development of standards and benchmarking in collaboration with stakeholders and end\-users to ensure that it was suitable for use nationally \( **R6**, **G1**\). Internal funding from UWE provided support for further stakeholder consultations and demonstration projects in Scotland \( **S2**, **S11**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The underpinning research leading to the development of  [*Building with Nature*](https://www.buildingwithnature.org.uk/indexw) \(BwN\) and other guidance has: 

-  increased knowledge and certainty about the characteristics of green infrastructure; 

-  enabled more effective planning policies to implement green infrastructure; 

-  ensured high quality green infrastructure is delivered in new developments and through retrofitting existing places; 

-  benefited residents and communities through provision of high\-quality infrastructure \-improving quality of life, health and well\-being and environmental quality; 

-  improved environmental quality, biodiversity and climate\-change resilience. 

 **Building with Nature** leads to better knowledge and certainty regarding the characteristics of high\-quality green infrastructure** 

 Impact and the findings of UWE research with stakeholders \( **R4**\) established a framework of principles for high quality green infrastructure \( **G1**, **G3**, **R2**\). The KTP with Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust \(GWT\) supported the initial development of the *Building with Nature* framework and two *BwN* user guides; one focussed on benchmarking policy, and the other on new developments and a set of demonstration projects. This resulted in a benchmark for green infrastructure in the UK. This included a suite of standards, along with detailed criteria for planners, development surveyors, landscape architects and ecological consultants \( **S1**, **S2**\). It also positioned GWT and the wider wildlife trust movement as leaders in green infrastructure, planning and delivery. BwN’s Director noted that: 

 *‘It has triggered a complete turnaround in our approach to the built environment and the quality of our \[GWT’s\] engagement with planners and developers’* \( **S2**\). 

 Follow\-on funding to UWE from NERC \(2016\-17\) supported the expansion of this initial work with GWT into a national benchmark for green infrastructure, working with end users to ensure fitness for purpose. This led to the establishment of *Building with Nature*, a dedicated charitable organisation, owned by GWT, with core employees, a board of trustees chaired by Professor Peter Madden OBE, former CEO of Future Cities Catapult and Forum for the Future, and a Standards Board of industry and public sector professionals to oversee robust standards. In 2017, further consultation with end\-users and demonstration sites, funded by UWE, led to the adoption of *BwN* in Scotland \( **S3**, **S4**, **S5**\). 

 Operating nationally, *BwN* \( **S5**\) has developed standards, best practice guidance, training and accreditation processes based on UWE’s initial research, UWE’s partnership with GWT, and subsequent collaboration with wide\-ranging partners and stakeholders. BwN aims, nationally, to support and encourage planning authorities, professional experts and developers, to deliver high quality green infrastructure in wide\-ranging development contexts. 

 **UWE research extends the reach of green infrastructure quality improvement** 

 Since 2019, *BwN* is referenced in the *English National Design Guide* by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \( **S6**\). It has been highlighted as a tool for achieving high quality design in garden communities by Homes England \( **S7**\) and climate action by the Royal Town Planning Institute \( **S8**\). It has also been recommended for use by housing associations by Linc Cymru \( **S9**\), and formed the basis of a review of the planning policies across the Central Scotland Green Network \( **S3**\). 

 Policy makers have used UWE’s research to develop more effective policies, enabling them to specify their expectations for green\-blue infrastructure at a local level in a range of contexts. Newcastle City Council \(NCC\) issued a declaration, along with multiple actors, in which they committed to changing their approach to infrastructure development in the city to include a greater focus on green infrastructure and more emphasis on listening to local voices \( **R6**, **G5**\). In this they explicitly acknowledged UWE’s research in making a distinct and material contribution to this declaration \( **S10**\). In December 2020, Newcastle City Council became the first local authority to undertake *BwN* training. 

 UWE’s work also impacted directly on the inception of Learning and Action Alliances \(LAAs\) and city redevelopment plans in both Newcastle and Ebbsfleet \( **R6**, **S10**\). 

 The ‘ *research supported us \[NCC\] in beginning to develop a £87.5m transformative surface water management plan for the urban core*’ between NCC and Northumbrian Water Limited, informed by the LAA and Blue\-Green cities research \( **S10**\). 

 The report *Sustainable urban drainage \- retrofitting for improved flood mitigation in city centres* \(produced by UWE for the Royal Institution for Chartered Surveyors \(RICS\) research trust **G4**, **R1**\), contributed to the development of a business case for Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) \( **S10**\). A leading figure for several years in NCC praised the report as: 

 ‘*the first independent evidence that this was a potential game changer for the city...invaluable in making the case for implementing blue\-green infrastructure in Newcastle’* \( **S10**\). 

 Thirty local authority planning policies are being certified with *BwN* \( **S2**, **S12**\). For example, West Cheltenham’s Cyber Central Garden Community Supplementary Planning Document and West Dunbartonshire’s Local Development Plan have been awarded BwN ‘Excellent’ accreditation as ‘ *an exemplar in policy making with regards policy commitment and clear policy requirements for high\-quality green infrastructure through the planning and development process*’ \( **S4**, **S11**, **S12**\). The framework is also referenced as supplementary guidance in the Essex Design Guide, covering fourteen local planning authorities \( **S12**\). 

 By the end of 2020, *BwN* had certified fourteen developments in Scotland and England, with a further 44 underway across the UK \( **S2**, **S5**, **S12**\). The certified developments amount to: 9,158 homes, where green infrastructure is a key aspect of the design; 108 hectares of employment land, including a 10 hectares new business park and two motorway service areas; and an 860 inpatient bed hospital with 28 hectares of woodland \( **S2**, **S5**, **S12**\). The additional 44 developments will bring this total to over 30,000 new homes \( **S12**\), and include those delivered by volume housebuilders. The benchmark is now also supported by a training package for *BwN* Assessors to further increase knowledge in the sector, resulting in a network of 50 assessors in the UK \( **S2**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 McAlinden’s research prompted reform of the law relating to grooming in six Australian states and territories. Her research, highlighting the ‘legislative gap’ that exists with respect to the grooming of persons other than a child was cited in support of the recommendations of a major parliamentary inquiry in Victoria, the second most populous state. For the first time anywhere, grooming was criminalised as a ‘stand\-alone’ sexual offence. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse modelled their understanding of grooming on McAlinden’s definition and recommended the enactment of a new grooming offence across Australia. A further five states or territories have introduced legislation to this effect. McAlinden’s research has also informed public and professional discourses at national and international level. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Utilising a range of methodologies \(comparative, doctrinal, theoretical and empirical\), Professor McAlinden has published widely on the dynamics of sexual offending behaviour, including grooming. Through a series of monographs, book chapters and journal articles as well as public presentations and expert testimony, she has directly broadened the political, public and legal understanding of grooming and its role in child sexual abuse. 

 Grooming is generally taken to refer to the preparatory process which precedes child sexual abuse. McAlinden’s article published in 2006 was one of the first academic outputs on this topic **\[R1\]**. The core argument is that in addition to a child as the intended or primary victim, families and parents/carers can also be groomed in order to gain access to a child; and that, as a ‘preparatory behaviour’, this is not currently captured by the criminal law. This article also coined the phrase 'institutional grooming’ to explain how abuse may occur in organisational contexts with respect to protective adults as well as children. 

 McAlinden’s profile as a recognised international authority on grooming has been underpinned by two additional research projects each resulting in a monograph on the topic. The first involved international comparative research on social, policy and legislative responses to grooming in a range of settings **\[R2\]**. This study produced new insights on the role of grooming in the onset and maintenance of child sexual abuse within families and institutions as well as on\-line and the challenges this poses for current regulatory responses. In particular, this research highlighted the limitations of current legal responses to grooming in a range of jurisdictions, including Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, which for the most part recognised grooming in very narrow terms as occurring only in on\-line settings. It argued for the need for law and policy to broaden their understanding of grooming in order to capture the multi\-dimensional nature of grooming behaviour and the ways in which it can occur in a range of contexts including both on\-line and off\-line. 

 This research produced a new and original definition of grooming which better captures the complexity of the process, incorporating, for the first time, all aspects of grooming including on the internet, via families, within institutions and among peers: 

 *\(1\) the use of a variety of manipulative and controlling techniques \(2\) with a vulnerable subject \(3\) in a range of inter\-personal and social settings \(4\) in order to establish trust or normalise sexually harmful behaviour \(5\) with the overall aim of facilitating exploitation and/or prohibiting exposure.* 

 The key aspect of this new definition is that it went beyond previous research by explicitly recognising the twin purposes of grooming in both making abuse possible as well as subsequently keeping it hidden. The empirical research was funded by the British Academy and published as a sole\-authored monograph by Oxford University Press in 2012. 

 The second project explored ‘peer based grooming’ within the context of a broader study on ‘risk’ and harmful and exploitative sexual behaviours among children and young people, drawing on the international literature and empirical research conducted by the author. This project examined the complexities of peer\-to\-peer forms of grooming and how they might operate in institutional contexts, such as schools or care homes, to normalise harmful sexual behaviour and perpetuate abusive practices. The research was funded by the National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers \(NOTA\) – one of the leading international organisations in the field. The resultant sole\-authored monograph was published by Cambridge University Press in 2018 **\[R3\]**. 

 McAlinden has made invited contributions on ‘grooming’ to edited collections comprised of practitioner and academic perspectives **\[R4\]** and to practitioner journals **\[R5\]**. In addition, she has also established research expertise on Australian inquiries into institutional abuse having published an article as lead author with an Australian academic in the *Sydney Law Review* \(2016\),  the leading Australian law journal **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact of McAlinden’s research on grooming has occurred in the following ways: First, it underpinned the recommendations of a parliamentary inquiry and shaped the formulation of a new offence of ‘grooming’ in Victoria, the second most populous state in Australia with a population of 6.49M, including 1.01M children. Subsequently, her research and expert testimony provided to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse resulted in recommendations to extend this ‘grooming offence’ across Australia. Five further states or territories within Australia to date have enacted or amended legislation to this effect, strengthening child protection policies and helping to safeguard a combined child population of 4.26M. McAlinden’s research has also informed public and professional debates on grooming at a national and international level. 

 **Public Inquiry & Recommendations for Law Reform** 

 McAlinden’s earlier \(2006\) research on grooming **\[R1\]** was first cited by a parliamentary inquiry on institutional child abuse in Victoria, Australia \( *Betrayal of Trust*, 2013\), where the Inquiry picked up on McAlinden’s research themselves. 

 McAlinden’s research made a distinct and material contribution to the recommendations of the Victoria Inquiry and the legislation enacted as a result of that Inquiry. Published in November 2013, the Inquiry Report cited the research in recommending the enactment of a new criminal offence of grooming a child, their parents or others with the intention of committing a sexual offence against a child. Within Volume 2, Chapter 22 of the Inquiry Report, ‘The Criminality of Grooming’, McAlinden’s article is cited 3 times in 11 pages **\[Source A below\]**. Beyond witness transcripts and other inquiry reports, there were no other academic texts cited in this part of the Inquiry Report. As McAlinden had recommended, this new offence explicitly recognises that children, as well as their parents, carers or other family members, may be targeted and ‘groomed’ by would\-be ‘sex offenders’, via for example, offenders befriending or commencing relationships with parents as a prelude to sexual abuse. 

 **New Legislation on ‘Grooming’** 

 Recommendations from the Inquiry led to legal and policy reform in Victoria in which ‘grooming’ was redefined for the first time as a substantive sexual offence, rather than simply an aggravating factor **\[Source B below\]**. The new offence of ‘grooming for sexual conduct with a child under 16’ was enacted by the Crimes Amendment \(Grooming\) Act 2014 in Victoria, Australia \(amending the Crimes Amendment Act 1958, section 49M\) **\[Source C below\]**. This now makes it an offence to groom a child under 16 or their parents or carers with a penalty of up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The offence commenced 9 April 2014. The offence provides that a person \(A\) commits an offence if – 

 a. A is 18 years of age or more; and 

 b. A communicates, by words or conduct \(whether or not a response is made to the communication\), with – 

 i. another person \(B\) who is a child under the age of 16 years; *or* 

 *ii.  another person under whose care, supervision or authority B is* \[emphasis added\]; and 

 c. A intends that the communication facilitate B engaging or being involved in the commission of a sexual offence by A or by another person who is 18 years of age or more 

 This offence, as recommended by the Inquiry based on McAlinden’s research, explicitly recognises the broader scope of grooming – i.e. that grooming often occurs off\-line where parents, carers or those responsible for a child can also be groomed – is the first offence of its kind in the world.  Other countries, including previously parts of Australia, have criminalised grooming in much narrower terms by, for example, confining this offence to electronic/on\-line forms of grooming or communication with a child only \(see e.g. UK, Republic of Ireland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, USA\) **\[Source D below\]**. 

 Further, the Victim’s Charter Act 2006 in Victoria, Australia, was also amended in April 2014 to expressly provide that a child and family members as victims of this grooming offence are entitled to provide a victim impact statement to a court **\[Source C below\]**. 

 This new offence has been incorporated within the Education and Training on Child Protection for the 2,263 schools and colleges across Victoria, benefitting 1.01million children **\[Source B below\]**. According to internal figures from the Crimes Statistics Agency in Victoria, a total of 772 counts of the offence were recorded by Victoria police over the approximate six\-year period since enactment \(April 2014\-June 2020\) **\[Source E below\]**. In addition, there have been a number of prosecutions, including a Supreme Court of Victoria decision, where off\-line forms of ‘grooming’, traditionally thought of as a pre\-abuse behaviour, have been recognised as even more significant than other substantive sexual offences in sentencing decisions **\[Source C below\]**. 

 **Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse** 

 A Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was established, extending to the whole of Australia \(2013\-2017\). McAlinden’s research and testimony directly informed the work and recommendations of the Royal Commission leading to changes in the law.  Her initial involvement is perhaps best summarised by the Chairperson: 

 *We became aware of her research through our work for the Royal Commission … On the basis of Professor McAlinden’s international reputation on “grooming and entrapment” the Royal Commission invited her to provide critical feedback in June 2016 on a draft of our research report on “Grooming and Abuse in Institutional Contexts.” Her feedback was very helpful to the Royal Commission in highlighting several key gaps in current knowledge and understanding of grooming* **\[Source F below\]**. 

 In providing this critical review for the Royal Commission, McAlinden identified several specific ‘gaps’ in current academic and policy discourses on grooming stemming from her own research – e.g. the need for a clear and comprehensive definition of ‘grooming’; the significance of the notions of ‘peer\-grooming’, grooming within institutions \(‘institutional grooming’\). She also submitted two further publications on grooming to the Commission’s research team **\[R1\]** and **\[R2\]**. 

 The Commission’s Research Report published in February 2017, which supported the hearings and final recommendations of the Commission, cites \[R1\] and \[R2\] extensively \(39 times over 29 pages\). In particular, the report utilised McAlinden’s definition of grooming, cited her research with respect to the grooming of significant others to facilitate abuse, and included a specific section on ‘institutional grooming’ based on McAlinden’s research and coining of that term **\[Source G below\]**. 

 McAlinden was subsequently invited as an international expert in March 2017 by the Royal Commission, giving written and oral evidence on ‘grooming and entrapment.’ She also provided written responses to key questions \(9 pp\) for use by the Commission lawyers in advance of the testimony. The Commission’s report and recommendations were published in December 2017. 

 This final report quoted extensively from the transcript of McAlinden’s evidence **\[Source H below\]** and again cited her published research multiple times to support its findings. Across the 17\-volume report **\[Source I below\]**, her research/testimony is cited 78 times – the 2006 article is cited 8 times, the 2012 book 51 times, and the transcript of oral evidence 18 times with a further reference to a co\-authored article **\[R5\]**. 

 McAlinden’s research and testimony emerged as being pivotal to the Commission’s understanding, findings and recommendations in relation to grooming and its role in child sexual abuse. The Chairperson of the Royal Commission further commented: 

 *Professor McAlinden’s evidence and her research was highly influential in shaping our understanding of the scope and complexities of grooming … the Commission based its definition of grooming on that outlined in her 2012 book …. Her research and evidence directly informed our recommendations 25 and 26 which advocated for the enactment of a broad ‘grooming offence’ … throughout Australia to capture any communication or conduct with a child \(recommendation 25\) and the grooming of persons other than the child \(recommendation 26\)* **\[Source F below\]**. 

 The Australian government has since amended Commonwealth \(federal\) legislation to give effect to these recommendations specifically enacting a new offence of the grooming of third parties in order to engage in sexual activity with a child outside Australia, via section 6 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment \(Sexual Crimes Against Children\) and Community Protection Measures Act 2020 **\[Source J below\]**. As of December 2020, five other states or territories have introduced or amended legislation to give effect to the Royal Commission’s recommendations as related to a new grooming offence \(Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland\) and in the remaining two \(Western Australia and the Northern Territory\) these recommendations have been accepted in principle or are under consideration **\[Source J below\]**. 

 **Contribution to Public Debates on ‘Grooming’** 

 As an acknowledged expert, McAlinden has had significant reach in contributing to public and professional debates on ‘grooming’ nationally and internationally. This has included invited professional publications for a special issue of *Probation Journal* **\[R5\]**, a broad range of keynote addresses and extensive media coverage and interviews. McAlinden gave the keynote addresses on ‘Grooming’ and ‘Peer Abuse’ at the NOTA Conference in September 2015 and 2019, one of the leading academic/practitioner international conferences in the field, attended annually by around 300 delegates from all over the world including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. She has been interviewed and cited as an authority on grooming and institutional abuse in national and international print and broadcast media: see eg *RTE Six One and Nine O’Clock* News \(10/3/17\) & *The Irish Examiner* \(12/3/17\) \(Ireland\); *Pacific Daily News/USA Today* \(11/10/2017\) \(USA\); *The Nation* \(New Zealand\) \(22/09/2017\); and *The Sydney Morning Herald* \(29/03/2017\) & *ABC Radio* ‘The World Today’ \(Australia\) \(27/03/2017\) both of which published/played excerpts from her Royal Commission testimony **\[Source K below\]**. She was profiled in *the Times Higher Education* as a ‘world leading academic’ \(February, 2018\).

A number of research projects are concerned with imprisonment and how to understand and design prison life in ways that allow for social reintigration and lower repeat crime and recidivism.",33.04,21.97,21.33,32.26,14.9,26.03,36,13,178,76,104,23,452,158,101,19,0.1479895104895104,0.0751178451178451,0.2467942976563666,0.1311774717218265,0.1652727272727272,0.1346895558509731,5670

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The specific impacts of this tripartite research project, involving a Company Partner \(Ask Outlets Ltd.\), the University and Innovate UK, are twofold: 

1.  the design and development of innovative enhanced web technology and data warehousing and forecasting solutions has enabled the Company to achieve productivity efficiency, sales growth and consumer behaviour insight, and 

1.  this successful Partnership demonstrates the significance of HEIs responding effectively to the UK Government’s economic growth agenda to deliver private\-sector led innovation, economic benefit and sustainability. 

 The aim of the Partnership is to maximise the strengths of each partner to achieve technology solutions to meet the economic challenges facing resource\-constrained SMEs in the aggressive online retail industry. The Partnership was sustained over a number of years and through two KTPs, which resulted in a strong knowledge and requirements exchange underpinned by two research strands that have led to \(a\) the development of an e\-business platform and \(b\) the development of an integrated business\-forecasting tool. This Project was given an Outstanding award by independent assessors at Innovate UK in 2017, and short\-listed for inclusion in its bank of case studies.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The intelligent web \(5.0\), the mobile web \(4.0\) and the semantic web \(3.0\) enable internet services and platforms to be extremely productive. However, a typical SME may not have a business need for users to submit content or to be able to interact with each other. Instead, there may be a more simplified requirement for a bespoke solution using enhanced Web 2.0 technology. The starting point for this research was to develop a robust, reliable, efficient and novel framework using enhanced Web 2.0 technology that would serve as a front and middleware collaboration model between data persistence logic and operational requests. This framework was to serve as a mediation platform for request brokers. It would provide a high level of abstraction by encapsulating low\-level details of the system, such as request handling, request mediation, response handling and service handling. 

 The London Met team, led by Professor Karim Ouazzane, set about constructing an efficient framework for utilizing Web 2.0 component technology, which would facilitate the transformation of small retailers’ businesses into e\-businesses \[R1\]. The model framework developed by the London Met team is an extension of the well\-known Service\-Oriented Architecture SOAW2 framework which provides users with an option to adapt their e\-businesses according to their individual needs using additional profiling and customization. This is achieved by introducing an extra layer in the architecture that supports the brokering of both the user requests for services and the service responses generated in return. 

 In order to deploy the e\-business framework and to continue this work to provide retailers with a solution which is of scientific relevance and commercial significance, London Metropolitan University partnered with Ask Outlets Ltd. \(Ask\), a multi\-channel consumer electronics retailer based in London, under the auspices of Innovate UK’s Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) scheme and received a grant of GBP95,000 in 2012. The KTP Associate, Sajid Afzal with academics Prof. Ouazzane and Dr David Ward used the KTP to develop a bespoke CRM system capable of identifying consumer purchasing behaviours and providing greater customer base interactions, which could lead directly to improved online sales \[R1\]. 

 Once the CRM had been embedded within Ask in 2013, we embarked on the next stage of maximising productivity. This time we turned our attention to research that could identify trends that facilitate effective sales operations, inventory planning, purchasing process, budget planning and market insight. 

 The London Met team understood from our ongoing relationship with Ask that off the shelf software packages available to retailers created more challenges than they solved when used by SMEs without dedicated IT support. To address these challenges, a generic data warehousing solution was developed which meets the needs of retailers who favour a hybrid multi\-channel business model in which agility of decision\-making is crucial for survival and growth. 

 Using a standard data warehousing life cycle approach, we applied a method that includes three stages to design and develop a generic data warehousing solution that is applicable to a wide range of consumer electronics retailers \[R2\]. The three stages are: analysis of business processes, dimensional data modelling, and implementation of data warehousing. An advantage of this novel solution is that it does not require IT expertise for use and maintenance, and is therefore readily implementable by SMEs who may not have a dedicated IT services team. In addition, the generic and platform\-independent nature of the technology solution makes it a viable option for immediate adoption by a wide range of consumer electronics retailers. 

 In 2015, we embarked on a second KTP with Ask Outlets Ltd., with a grant of GBP105,000. The KTP Associate, Samson Habte, along with academics Prof. Ouazzane and Dr Preeti Patel engaged with the Company to apply integration technologies to a bespoke data warehouse solution for business forecasting. 

 This Project was given the award of Outstanding by independent assessors at Innovate UK \[R3\] in 2017, and short\-listed for inclusion in its bank of case studies.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The knowledge exchange opportunities that arose from a strong and sustained Partnership during the course of two successive KTPs \[S1, S2\] have had far\-reaching benefits to all stakeholders. However, it is the particular benefits to the SME that are focussed on here. 

 Firstly, it is important to state the context and nature of the business. As multi\-channel consumer electronics retailers operate in dynamic and highly competitive market conditions, they are under constant pressure to invest in new communication and information technologies that automate or support retail activities to increase productivity and gain competitive advantage. SMEs are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in the marketplace, and as many do not have adequate resources to develop bespoke technological solutions, they are continually in danger of losing market share. 

 The two research strands that have led to \(a\) the development of an e\-business platform and \(b\) the development of an integrated business forecasting tool have come about as a result of knowledge and requirements exchange between Ask Outlets Ltd. \(the Company\) and London Metropolitan University \(the University\). 

 **1<sup>st</sup> KTP – business strategy realignment and new revenue channels** 

 In the first of the two KTPs, the KTP Associate Sajid Afzal, under the direction of Prof.  Ouazzane and Dr David Ward applied the research to the development of a bespoke CRM system that has enabled the Company to have more productive interaction with their consumer base. The CRM has resulted in a measurable <ins>improvement of sales revenue</ins> \- but most importantly, has been instrumental by the end of the two\-year KTP \(2014\) in a <ins>material shift</ins> in the Company’s overall strategy, through <ins>new revenue generating channels</ins> that have been created. 

 As a “ *direct result of the introduction of the CRM software*” Ask have introduced new internal systems which “ *maximise \[their\] stock ordering processes*” ensuring that they only order products to meet customers’ needs and which have resulted in an average “ *annual saving of £200k per annum for the financial years 2015 – 2020”* \[S3\]. 

 In the KTP final report submitted to Innovate UK \[S1\], the Company was asked to assess the nature and significance of the impact on their activities as achieved through the partnership. The Company confirmed that the following impacts have been **highly** achieved: increased breadth of information or extent of dissemination, improved customer or stakeholder satisfaction and improved efficiency or productivity. The KTP final report summarizes the main benefits to the Company as being \(a\) enhanced revenue generation through the ability to identify new trends through consumer profiling and \(b\) enhanced agility through the ability to monitor and react to dynamic competitor pricing. In 2014, the Company reported a GBP350,000 increase in the annual sales turnover directly attributable to the KTP \[S1\]. 

 **2<sup>nd</sup> KTP – growth and sustainability** 

 In the second of the two KTPs, the KTP Associate Samson Habte, under the direction of Prof. Ouazzane and Dr Preeti Patel applied the research to the development of an integrated business\-forecasting tool. The aim of this research was to support the Company’s decision\-making processes in order to make increases in productivity across all sales channels, thereby ensuring growth and sustainability. Mr Sandip Patel, Managing Director, identified changes in consumer activity as a result of economic changes, including Brexit, which made the introduction of a forecasting tool an essential part of forward planning. The Company’s valuable data and information assets are now \(from 2017 onwards\) used to gain forecasting insights, leading to competitive advantage. Amongst the many benefits the Company has gained are \(cited by the Company in their input to the KTP final report \[S2\]\): 

-  the <ins>minimising of risk</ins> to both under\-stocks and over\-stocks as replenishment can be predicted which leads to a direct reduction in inventory costs, 

-  a <ins>reduced staff workload</ins> has resulted from inventory optimisation leading to productivity being increased by approximately 40%, 

-  the ability to <ins>monitor competitor pricing</ins> and react promptly to fluctuations, 

-  the <ins>relationship with the Company’s suppliers</ins> has also benefited by the prioritisation of stock allocations on a weekly basis, 

-  overall benefit of <ins>enhanced communication with suppliers</ins> for fulfilling stock orders, 

-  the empowerment of the Company’s team of buyers whose <ins>purchasing decisions are more accurately informed</ins>, resulting in profitable bulk purchasing, 

-  the ability to <ins>identify new trends through forecasting</ins> leading to the identification and introduction of new product lines. 

 Resulting directly from the KTP, these benefits have led to changes in the Company’s competitive position in terms of an increase in annual \(financial year 2018\-19\) sales turnover of GBP600,000 with a growth of GBP1,000,000 anticipated for financial year 2019. Mr Patel also reports that this growth is against a backdrop of “ *several smaller competitors \[falling\] into administration”* resulting in a less competitive market where Ask’s major competition is now “ *the bigger players such as John Lewis and PC World Currys.”* \[S3\]. 

 **Continued and long\-lasting significance and reach** 

 Participating in the KTPs has enabled the Company to be sustainable and resilient in the marketplace. These improvements were felt soon after the projects completed, and Mr Patel has also been able to report on the continued benefits. The most impactful of these developments include expansion of the business into new localities within the UK, job creation and development, knock\-on benefits to supplier sales teams and the ability to perform strongly in the online arena during the coronavirus pandemic \(2020\). 

 Improvements in internal systems, staff realignment and focus on multichannel business have taken place in the intervening period. Specifically, improved business performance measures include: by only ordering those products required by customers and bulk buying of specific products has allowed Ask to manage their “ *overall stock holding and free up \[their\] cash flow especially when \[their\] have been growing*” and allowing Ask to focus on “ *online and through multi\-channel marketplaces*” where their growth has been “ *approximately 31%”* year\-on\-year \[S3\]. 

 The company’s 2020 testimonial \[S3\] gives explicit details of continued expansion opportunities \(in the form of newly launched store locations across the UK\) which are attributable to the KTP inventory planning and forecasting solutions. The new Sony Centre in Birmingham “... *is currently generating sales of approximately £600k pa and we have recruited an additional 8 staff*”. The new Audio\-Visual outlet located in the royal\-warranted Daniel Department Store in Windsor is similarly performing well, “ *Here we have recruited an additional six staff and this outlet is currently generating approximately £800k pa*”. 

 The CRM tool, together with the forecasting solution has enabled the Company to explore potential new product branding opportunities beyond their traditional Sony Centre brand. Their new store in Windsor is multi\-branded incorporating additional brands such as Roberts Radio, LG and Samsung by the showcasing of “... *the complete range on play tables for customers to touch and try”,*  with the result that *“one particular brand has grown almost 300% compared to previous year”* with additional benefits of increased support from the branded supplier such as local advertising and promotions. This multi\-brand store has also allowed Ask to showcase the new brands both in store and online \[S3\]. 

 In addition to the jobs created at the locations, the existing workforce experienced positive change as a result of the introduction of the software. A reduced need for staff in the product buying team allowed those staff to be retrained to research new products. New staff are “ *delivering advertising through online platforms*” Ask’s staff have reported that “ *the additional training and changes to their roles has enhanced their personal esteem and has given them improved career options*” \[S3\]. 

 Positive feedback received from Ask’s suppliers relates to the seamless analysis of the Company’s sales data, via the forecasting tool, which allows the suppliers’ sales teams to identify growth of particular items and adjusting their own supply to match. Mr Patel summarises this domino\-effect as “.. *.So, this has not only benefited us, but the suppliers are also benefiting with our sales data*” \[S3\]. 

 The Managing Director concludes with “ *The changes and benefits to our business that resulted from both the CRM and forecasting solutions have enabled the business to, hopefully, weather the current coronavirus crisis*.” \[S3\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Edwards’ research informed the World Health Organisation’s \(WHO\) Ethics Guidance and a Training Manual for clinical research during epidemics of emerging and re\-emerging infectious diseases, for which no effective treatments or vaccines are known. The ethics guidance applied to 4955 studies undertaken into WHO’s priority infectious diseases and pathogens with over 88 million participants globally. Edwards' research has benefited individuals participating in clinical research by promoting wider access to new and repurposed medicines and by protecting the rights and interests of current patients. Edwards initiated the development of an Afrocentric ethics framework for clinical research during epidemics across Africa and supervised a project for the African Union Centres for Disease Control \(Africa CDC\), involving wide consultation, engagement, and training. Her expertise has been consulted over clinical research for COVID\-19 by organisations such as WHO, Africa CDC, and the US FDA which issued new guidelines leading to >370 early approvals of medicines and medical products with surveillance for research.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Sarah Edwards has developed a leading body of research, which examines the relationship between ethics and methodology in clinical research. She argues that trial design can be made more responsive to current patients’ clinical needs without sacrificing methodological rigour or scientific gain. In 2013, she published the first article \[ **R1**\] to define the unique moral challenges raised by, and develop ethical standards for, clinical research specifically during the circumstances of public health crises for which no known effective treatments or vaccines exist. These exceptional moral concerns, she argues, undermine the traditional precautionary assumptions that underlie the regulation of medicines. Under such approaches, access to new medicines should be initially restricted to small samples of the population in order first to establish a new treatment’s safety and efficacy, often through the conventional randomised controlled trial \( **RCT**\), before making them more widely available. Where a particular new or repurposed treatment offers a patient the only potential chance at life, then the liberty to access that treatment directly is a significant one. During public health emergencies, such restrictive regulatory rules are more difficult to justify since they primarily seek to gain knowledge to treat future, rather than current patients whose lives could be immediately threatened. Edwards argues that science can advance successfully through ‘natural experiments’ which prioritise individual and current patients’ interests providing direct access to potentially beneficial medicines. 

 Edwards hosted an international academic conference in June 2014 to review her work in \[ **R1**\]. Representatives from regulatory agencies participated in the conference including the World Health Organization, the US Food and Drug Administration \( **FDA**\), and the European Medicines Agency \( **EMA**\). In August that year, Ebola was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern. With collaborators, Edwards secured two major awards from the European African Clinical Trials Partnership \( **EDCTP**\) to support research during epidemics across Africa \[ **i**\], one specifically for Ebola to gauge local views and values \[ **ii**\]. 

 To help undermine the regulatory premise behind restricting access to new medicines in the way outlined above, Edwards later targeted the epistemic assumption that placebo controlled RCTs are the most efficient scientific method to gain knowledge to treat future patients. In \[ **R2**\], Edwards with colleagues in philosophy of science, argued that robust scientific methods use data from different sources including from wild animals which may also be susceptible to similar diseases as humans, for example Ebola in Chimpanzees and Gorillas. Methodological pluralism holds that claims regarding causality are more credible when evidence from different sources points to a similar result. Developing a range of methods for ‘real\-world’ research, Edwards, with colleagues, developed an ethical framework for so\-called pragmatic trials whose aim is to generate data on how interventions could work in practice rather than under artificial conditions of a conventional placebo\-controlled trial \[ **R3**\]. Edwards later showed that a pragmatic approach could efficiently replace the need for subsequent ‘implementation studies’ to establish how well clinical trial results can be applied more widely especially in the context of COVID\-19 \[ **R4**\]. Given the sheer number of new and repurposed treatment candidates available, large effects will become apparent from smaller observational or ‘screening’ studies especially when no formal clinical trial has \(yet\) been set up as in \[ **R5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Edwards’ research shaped the World Health Organisation’s \( **WHO**\) **Guidance For Managing Ethical Issues In Infectious Disease Outbreaks**, for clinical research during public health crises, and also helped to inform the WHO training programme. Edwards’ expertise initiated and supported the development of an Afrocentric ethics framework for clinical research during epidemics across Africa. Her expertise had been sought to help prioritise ethical and efficient research for COVID\-19 by WHO, Africa CDC, and the US FDA amongst others. 

 **Shaping global ethical standards for clinical research during public health emergencies** 

 The numbers of clinical research studies internationally, especially in developing countries, are increasing as more public health crises arise, and emerging and re\-remerging infectious diseases, especially zoonoses \(infectious diseases caused by pathogens jumping from animals to humans\), become increasingly problematic with human populations encroaching on wildlife and engaging in intensive farming. In turn, this has led to changes in the ways in which clinical research is conducted, particularly by ensuring the use of a robust ethical framework for evaluating study designs and methodology. Edwards' research has benefited individuals participating in clinical research by promoting wider access to new and repurposed medicines and by protecting the rights and interests of current patients. In so doing, the research has helped to address the problem of designing and recruiting participants for clinical research during public health emergencies. 

 Edwards’ research informed training of healthcare workers and researchers by WHO and other organisations. Edwards’s 2013 paper \[ **R1**\] was reviewed by WHO and international regulators including the FDA and EMA at the conference she held in June 2014. The **WHO Training Manual,** **Ethics in epidemics, emergencies and disasters: research, surveillance and patient care** \[ **A**\] **,** was published in 2015 and later translated into Chinese. It had been downloaded >4,000 times by 31\-12\-2020 \[ **A**\]. The Manual discusses \[ **R1**\] under three of its seven core competencies, including the “Ability to define adequate processes for ethics review in public health interventions, surveillance and research in emergencies”. It also contains a case study based on \[ **R1**\] \[in **A**, pp.70\-71\]. Edwards’ \[ **R1**\] is cited ten times in the Manual, and other papers by Edwards a further five times \[ **1**\]. The Manual thus seeks to illustrate the ethical problems and putative solutions identified in \[ **R1**\] to encourage more consideration and critical thought on why new medicines are restricted and how health research can progress in context. Edwards also served as a named reviewer of this Manual for WHO. The Manual addresses what it calls a “lack of international consensus” on some aspects of research, surveillance and patient care in emergencies and is designed to “give participants a certain proficiency in ethical reasoning and awareness of the main ethical dilemma that can arise in emergencies” \[ **A**\]. Consequently, it has been regularly used by WHO in training workshops run globally. In addition, the course has been taken 16,795 times on The Global Health Network \(a digital platform that delivers training, skills and career development to healthcare workers and researchers\) alone \[ **B**\]. Participants commented that they would now consider all the issues raised in the course before making decisions and they would seek to disseminate the Guidance further by including it in their own courses \[ **B**\]. Healthcare workers and researchers are, as a result, better equipped to use innovative trial designs, natural experiments, and real\-world data to respond to epidemics and improving access to and standards for clinical care along the way. 

 Edwards is a named participant who contributed to the writing of **WHO **Guidance For Managing Ethical Issues In Infectious Disease Outbreaks**, published in 2016 and later translated into Chinese, Farsi and Faroese \[ **C**\]. Edwards’ paper \[ **R1**\] identified the ethical problems associated with restricting access to clinical trials during epidemics for which no proven treatment had been established at the outset of the outbreak. It also sought to resolve these problems using innovative trial designs and natural experiments and use of “real\-world” data. The WHO Guidance \[ **C**\] specifically gives guidance on innovative study designs to help promote the interests of current patients while gaining knowledge through research. WHO facilitates research on diseases posing public health threats of international concern and is legally authorised under the International Health Regulations \( **IHRs**\). The IHRs is a legally binding agreement governing questions of global health particularly public health emergencies of international concern. WHO guidance is technically referred to as “soft” or quasi\-law. While not legally binding as a code of practice, adherence by signatories of the IHRs is expected to enable WHO to discharge its legal function. When a public health emergency is declared, WHO has greater legal powers and adherence to guidance is more critical. Since the Guidance was published, a total of 4955 studies with over 88 million participants have been publicly recorded \(on clinicaltrials.gov\) to address WHO’s priority infectious diseases and pathogens including Ebola, Marburg Virus, Crimean\-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley Fever, Lassa Fever, and Zika. Through endorsement of Edwards’ research in \[ **R1**\], WHO Guidance governed the above studies of which 4397 studies were specifically related to Covid\-19 with 87,024656 participants. The Guidance was downloaded 28,300 times in the period April\-October 2020 alone, predominantly in the United States \(14,300 downloads\) \[ **C**\]. Edwards' research has thus benefited the many individual patients treated during outbreaks by promoting wider access to new and repurposed medicines, and future patients by protecting standards for clinical research.

 Through PANDORA\-ID NET \[ **i**\], a consortium of organisations across Africa and Europe supporting research in emerging and re\-emerging infectious diseases, Edwards was enlisted in 2018 to support the newly formed **Africa Centres for Disease Control \(Africa CDC\)**, part of the African Union, to initiate the development of an **authoritative African ethics framework for research during epidemics** across Africa \[ **D**\]. To help develop the Framework, and drawing on her expertise in **R1**, Edwards hosted a series of physical and virtual meetings with the Africa CDC to help consult and engage African communities of ethics committees, medical scientists, and public health practitioners \[ **D**\]. This included a “Workshop for research ethics committees across the whole Continent” attended by over 200 delegates, which “was the first event of its kind designed to facilitate shared discussion of an exchange of views on research ethics” \[ **E**\]. As the Director of Africa CDC, explains, “the information gained from the consultative work to date has already informed our approach to integrating research into outbreak responses in ethical ways”, including consideration of “repurposing vast numbers of existing therapies in an attempt to manage cases of Covid\-19”. \[ **D**\] They confirm, “Edwards’ work helped to systematize these efforts with research goals in mind, bringing them into line with WHO guidance on ethics and study design during public health emergencies” \[ **D**\]. Three quarters of respondents \(from 51 African countries\) felt that in the absence of available standard treatments, patients with confirmed infection during epidemics could benefit from unregistered interventions for which there is some scientific rationale. Regarding conventional placebo\-controlled trials during outbreaks with high case fatality rates, there were three times the number of respondents who considered such trials to be unethical than ethical \[ **D**\]. While the resulting Framework is yet to be finalised by the African Union, the Head of Public Health Institutes and Research for Africa CDC, who leads their public health research programme, has already put the approach to ethics and evidence into practice, for example through collaboration with some 800 senior first responders and integrating research into outbreak response, supported by Edwards \[ **D**\]. Edwards mentored the Head of Public Health Institutes and Research by supervising the project, from which the above survey results are drawn, through the **Chatham House African Leaders’ Fellowship** 2018/19 \[ **F**\]. Their collaboration is being used as a model by the Africa CDC: “to help strengthen National Public Health Institutes in each African Union Member State, we continue these conversations in ways first illustrated in Taj’s Chatham House work with Edwards” \[ **D**\]. 

 As a member of PANDORA\-ID NET, Edwards has contributed to the training of over 300 members of research ethics committees and regulators in central Africa, drawing on her expertise in **R1.** In April 2018, Edwards organised training **in Congo Brazzaville during the 9<sup>th</sup> Outbreak of Ebola** at the request of the Minister of Health \[ **E**\]. There were over 300 participants, including members of the national ethics committees and regulators from central Africa. In light of reviewing \[ **R1**\] and the WHO Guidance, participants drafted standard operating procedures for research ethics committees and a Community Engagement and Risk Communication Strategy for WHO AFRO, which adopts clinical research in a broader sense than clinical trials \[ **E**\]. As the PANDORA\-ID NET coordinator confirms “These documents were used for a preparedness response exercise across these countries then considered at high risk of Ebola, and were subsequently used to expand community consultation and engagement \[regarding clinical research\] during the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> outbreaks of Ebola in DRC” \[ **E**\]. During the **10<sup>th</sup> Outbreak of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo**, “Edwards’ expertise in clarifying the ethical implications for clinical decision\-making of using unregistered medical interventions” contributed to a workshop for small teams of specialist first responders in Uganda and a training event held in October 2018 in Kinshasa, DRC \[ **E**\]. Both events were specifically designed to support the availability and off\-label use of four then experimental drugs for Ebola and detail the requirements for consent in so doing. They were also designed to prepare the teams for recruiting to clinical trials that were later organised in the DRC to randomly allocate patients to these four drugs respectively without a placebo\-only control. 

 **Shaping Covid\-19 responses through research ethics advice** 

 Edwards participated in the **WHO R&D Blueprint meeting on COVID\-19** in Geneva in February 2020 where she helped identify important gaps in knowledge in the social sciences and in ethics regarding limits to extrapolating social and cultural acceptability of new therapeutics and vaccines from other contexts such as Influenza or Ebola and from other countries in which previous study had been undertaken \[ **G**\]. Soon thereafter, Edwards was invited “as a member and key advisor” to join the APANDEMIC initiative, which aims to “inform and support real\-world evidence for Covid\-19 research and decision\-making”, with the aim of encouraging “regulators and researchers to design studies which are methodologically efficient and ethical” \[ **H**\]. As the  President of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and member of APANDEMIC reports “Edwards’ research on ethics and methodology \[ **R1** and **R4**\] informed our \[APANDMICS’S\] **debate with** **US FDA**”. He explains “the pandemic has forced the US FDA to acknowledge the value of using real\-world evidence mainly as surveillance of medicines which have been approved for widespread use earlier than usual” and the FDA has “now issued guidance on using real\-world data to support regulatory decisions”, allowing medicines to be approved early for widespread use subject to later surveillance rather than waiting until after the traditional stages of clinical trials have been fully completed. \[ **H**\] >370 products \(Vaccines; Drug and Biological Therapeutic Products; In Vitro Diagnostic Products; Personal Protective Equipment and Related Medical Devices; Ventilators and Other Medical Devices\) have currently been approved under this guidance for COVID\-19 \[ **H**\]. Edwards helped set up a **compassionate access to medicines** programme at St George’s Hospital NHS Trust and Medical School establishing access to the drug Tocilizumab which turned out to be life\-saving. In 2020, in addition to the consultative workshop for the Africa CDC \(see above\), she participated in a joint webinar hosted by PANDORA\-ID Net, The Global Health Network and ALERRT on research ethics during public health emergencies \(particularly COVID\-19\) attended by over 300 delegates \[ **E**\]. Edwards was also invited to give a keynote lecture in November 2020 to help shape and formalise **early approval of new or repurposed medicines and vaccines** **for COVID\-19 in Israel** which has seen the first mass population vaccine programme for Covid\-19 in the world with extensive “real\-world” research \[ **I**\]. 110 participants from 19 countries attended and the Deputy Academic Director explains that: “From my own perspective as an ethicist and a lawyer specializing in public health policy, medical risk management and clinical care in Israel, these issues had been largely unclear and Edwards helped develop our thinking on the topic”. She “helped consolidate views on the therapeutic rationales and evidence for different treatments, as well as developing procedures for off label monitoring for research. In this way, we are able to offer a practical framework to provide access to new or repurposed treatments ethically and lawfully in hospitals with suitably trained healthcare staff” \[ **I**\].

 Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Teesside University on fluoride intake, retention and monitoring has reformed World Health Organisation \(WHO\) policy and led to changes in water and milk fluoridation schemes in the UK and Ireland. Specifically, the research has reshaped the WHO technical guidelines for the effective surveillance of fluoride exposure, underpinned Food Safety Authority of Ireland \(FSAI\) recommendations on dietary fluoride, and informed a UK regional authority’s decision to introduce a fluoridated\-milk scheme in local primary schools \(Blackpool Council\).

 According to the WHO, 60\-90% of school children are affected by tooth decay in industrialised countries. Topical use of fluorides has been recognised as the key reason for the decline in the prevalence of dental caries \(tooth decay\) worldwide. At low levels, fluoride reduces tooth decay, but high levels can damage developing tooth enamel in young children \(fluorosis\). It is, therefore, important that fluoride exposure is known, and that health authorities are made aware of exposure before the introduction of any fluoridation programmes for caries prevention. The WHO recommends that fluoride supplementation programmes should be monitored prior to, and after, implementation to ensure that ingestion of fluoride from all sources by the children involved is at the appropriate level. Research undertaken at Teesside University on the intake, retention and monitoring of fluoride has elucidated key issues in fluoride measurement and total fluoride exposure, leading to new developments in experimental models, fluoride databases and monitoring plans to better understand fluoride intake and retention. 

 From 2009\-2010, Zohoori collaborated with the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology \(University of Chile\), Antioquia University \(Colombia\), and Newcastle University \(UK\) to develop models based on available data to estimate total daily fluoride intake from daily urinary fluoride excretion, and, therefore, to predict the risk of fluorosis development. The researchers assumed a fluoride absorption of 90%. Reliably estimating intake from retention data requires a strong relationship between predictor and outcome, and detailed knowledge of the fraction of fluoride consumed that is retained. The analyses revealed strong positive linear relationships between both intake and excretion and intake and retention, with different slopes for children and adults. Interestingly, beyond thresholds for total daily fluoride intake of 0.5mg/day for children and 2mg/day for adults, fractional fluoride retention remained reasonably constant at 55% and 36% of total intake, respectively. Neutral fluoride balances \(fractional fluoride retention = 0\) were predicted when the total daily intake was around 0.07mg/day for children and 0.8mg/day for adults, or approximately 0.01mg per kg body weight per day, irrespective of age. These results permitted acceptable population\-level estimates of total daily fluoride intake from recorded daily urinary fluoride excretion, enabling predictions of the risk of fluorosis \[3.1\]. 

 From 2003 to 2010, Zohoori collaborated with nine fluoride research centres on a US NIH\-NIDCR \(National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research\) funded project to develop and evaluate key standardised techniques for determining the fluoride content of biological and non\-biological samples and, therefore, the accurate quantification of an individual’s fluoride exposure \[3.2\]. Since 2008, Zohoori led and co\-led a series of Organix Foundation and Borrow Foundation funded projects in which the fluoride content of >750 commercially available foods and drinks were measured. In 2015, this work resulted in the publication of a unique fluoride database, which was revised and updated in 2019 \[3.3, 3.4\]. 

 In 2008, and as part of a Borrow Foundation funded project, Zohoori co\-led a study that was commissioned by the UK National Fluoridated Milk Advisory Group to assess the appropriateness of the fluoride dose in milk. For many years, and in many countries, fluoride has been added to milk as a public health measure for caries control.  In the UK, milk fluoridation is used in school\-based programmes for children who reside in low fluoridated water areas and who are at high risk of caries. The original concentration of fluoride in milk was 0.5mg in a 189\-ml carton. Zohoori’s research indicated that both the existing fluoride concentrations of 0.5mg and the intervention project concentration of 0.9mg in a 189\-ml milk carton may be too low to achieve the WHO recommended urinary fluoride excretions concomitant with optimal fluoride exposure for children > 6y \[3.5\]. Consequently, Zohoori determined that UK schemes should review their current monitoring milk fluoridation programme.

 Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Information on total fluoride intake is essential when planning effective community\-based fluoridation programmes for the prevention of dental caries and/ or dental fluorosis. In 1999, the WHO published the document: <ins>Monitoring of Renal Fluoride Excretion in Community Preventive Programmes on Oral Health</ins>, as a key resource for the WHO Global Oral Health Programme. In 2011, a WHO technical working group meeting took place in Geneva to review this guidance. As a direct result of Zohoori’s research into fluoride intake and excretion, she was invited to this meeting as an international expert to change the technical guidelines and recommendations to enable countries to plan effective surveillance systems for community prevention programmes using fluoride. The technical guideline <ins>Basic Methods for Assessment of Renal Fluoride Excretion in Community Prevention Programmes for Oral Health</ins> was published in 2014 \[5.1\]. This technical guideline was based extensively on Zohoori’s research \(she was acknowledged directly on page 5\) and was written to help ‘countries to plan effective surveillance of fluoride exposure’ and to ‘stimulate oral health personnel and public health administrators to use a systematic approach to managing and analysing data obtained from different levels of fluoride exposure’. Tables 5.3\-5.5 of the guideline contain standards of urinary fluoride excretion in 24h urine collections associated with low fluoride exposure and for the range of “optimal” exposure. These standards are calculated from the experimental model that was developed by Zohoori in \[3.1\]. As a result, policy makers and public health authorities could more readily assess and/or monitor fluoride exposure at community levels. This guidance has been downloaded 5,101 times since 2016, with most downloads coming from the USA, India, China, UK, and Indonesia \[5.2\]. 

 The recommendations of the WHO technical guideline \[5.1\] have had continued relevance for the incorporation of fluoride\-based interventions into programmes designed to reduce early childhood caries \(ECC\). For example, the guideline \[5.1\] that draws heavily on Zohoori’s research has subsequently been used to inform the 2019 WHO implementation manual <ins>Ending Childhood Dental Carries</ins> \[5.3\]. This manual is intended to underpin decisions made by policy\-makers about ECC interventions, as well as for chief dental officers, ministry of health focal points, and public health administrators in ‘the development and implementation of plans for ECC prevention and control, using the primary health\-care approach’. It was stated that the manual ‘may also be used in training activities to help primary care teams understand ECC as a public health problem; recognize the essential risk factors for ECC, especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding, consumption of free sugars, and inadequate exposure to fluoride in prevention of dental caries; identify opportunities for intervention against ECC and its causes’. In particular, the manual directly draws on the research of Zohoori that underpinned the guideline, stating that ‘the population exposure to fluoride should be measured before programme implementation. An adequate surveillance system through periodic urinary fluoride monitoring in the child population should be considered’ \[5.3\]. The implementation manual has been downloaded 22,558 times since publication with top downloads from USA, Brazil, Mexico, Hong Kong, and Peru \[5.2\]. 

 The findings of this research also feature in a WHO information document for decision makers, <ins>Exposure to inadequate or excess fluoride: A major public health concern</ins> \[5.4\]. The document has been downloaded 4,356 times since publication \[5.2\]. This document makes clear recommendations based on Zohoori’s research in the technical report \[5.1\]: ‘to provide guidance on the need to control population exposures to fluoride and establish the important balance between caries prevention and protection against adverse effects, community health programmes can estimate total exposure by measuring renal fluoride excretion and compare these measurements with established optimal levels using methods published by the WHO \[Zohoori’s research in 5.1\] to undertake community measurement programmes’. 

 A fluoride database containing information on the fluoride content of commonly consumed food and drink items is a pre\-requisite for the assessment of dietary fluoride intake at individual and/or community levels. The Republic of Ireland is the only European country with mandatory national legislation requiring artificial fluoridation of drinking water. The principal function of the Food Standards Authority Ireland \(FSAI\) is to protect consumers and raise compliance through partnership, science, and food law enforcement. The FSAI is a statutory, independent, and science\-based body dedicated to protecting public health and consumer interests in the area of food safety and hygiene, which includes dietary intake of fluoride. As a result of Zohoori’s research on fluoride concentration data \[3.3, 3.4\], she made a significant contribution to the analysis component of a total diet study for the FSAI between 2014–2016 \[5.5, 5.6\]. For the Chief Specialist in Chemical Safety at FSAI, Zohoori provided ‘extensive input into the planning and subsequent execution of the analytical work required under the project. Prof. Zohoori is a renowned expert in fluoride analysis and, given her research on this topic, has advised the authority of numerous aspects in preparation of the analytical work. She subsequently took charge of the project, including sample analysis, followed by data generation and interpretation. She authored three project reports on fluoride analysis of Irish foods and beverages and provided intellectual input into queries arising during and after the study’ \[5.5\]. The study report enabled the FSAI to evaluate possible risks, if any, to the health of Irish children and adults. According to Chief Executive Officer at the FSAI: ‘This report serves to provide independent and impartial information on the exposure to fluoride through the Irish diet. It is an important piece of research which also takes into account naturally occurring levels of fluoride in food and beverages we consume in our diets in Ireland…This study reaffirms the FSAI’s and its Scientific Committee’s view that exposure to fluoride from the diet for all population groups in Ireland is not of concern’ \[5.7\]. The findings of the study were shared with the Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which operate under the aegis of the Department for Health. 

 Since only 10% of the UK population receive fluoridated water, a school milk fluoridation scheme was introduced in 1993 as a public health measure for caries control in non\-fluoridated socially deprived areas. In 2008, Zohoori co\-led a study, commissioned by the UK National Fluoridated Milk Advisory Group, to assess the appropriateness of the fluoride dose in milk. As a result of this initiative and her research, Blackpool Council contacted Zohoori in 2015 to develop a protocol to carry out a urinary fluoride excretion monitoring project to assess fluoride exposure of school children before making any decision on introducing fluoridated\-milk schemes in the primary schools in Blackpool. Based on the findings of the monitoring exercise, Blackpool Council’s Executive approved a proposal on the 18th Jan 2016 to introduce fluoridated milk to over 8000 school children in 37 primary schools in Blackpool as an acceptable measure of delivery of fluoride to school children \[5.8, 5.9, 5.10\]. The scheme is now in operation with over 70% of the milk ordered by Blackpool schools being fluoridated \[5.8\]. There has been an improvement in dental health of children during the scheme. The Director of Public Health for Blackpool Council said: ‘The average number of decayed, missing or filled teeth for 5\-year\-old children in Blackpool was 1.83 in 2014/15, which was significantly higher than the rate of 0.84 for England. This reduced to 1.15 in 2018/19, which was similar to the rate of 0.80 for England’ \[5.8\]. 

 The British Society of Dental Hygiene and Therapy \(BSDHT\) have subsequently referenced the initiative as best practice, with the President of the BSDHT saying: ‘It is great that the local council has recognised that something needs to be done to address this huge problem and taken positive action. Other areas with similar levels of oral health problems have already introduced such schemes and this is an opportunity to show other councils that with a small, inexpensive change huge benefits can be had’ \[5.9\]. 

 Overall, research on fluoride intake and measurement by Zohoori at Teesside University has had a significant impact on oral health policy at regional, national, and international levels. This work has led to changes in practice in the UK and supported the continuation of fluoridation schemes in Ireland.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Graham Smith is recognised in academic and practitioner circles as a world\-leading expert in the study of democratic innovations: new forms of engaging citizens in political decision\-making. His research in this area is widely acknowledged as central to the establishment of democratic innovations as a legitimate field of study within political science \(Elstub and Escobar  [<ins>2019</ins>](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/handbook-of-democratic-innovation-and-governance-9781786433855.html?): 12\). Smith has a particular specialism in the design and application of citizens’ assemblies, which bring together a randomly\-selected group of between 50 to 150 citizens to learn, discuss and come to judgements on a pressing political issue. The first citizens’ assembly took place in Canada in 2005. The model gained more widespread attention when it was used in Ireland in 2016 to 2018 to break political deadlock on constitutional issues such as abortion. 

 Citizens’ assemblies are part of a broader family of “deliberative mini\-publics” \(DMPs\) that combine random selection and facilitated deliberation. Smith’s innovative research has clarified the distinctive design characteristics of DMPs, distinguishing this institutional form from other approaches to participatory governance \[1\]. He has articulated the significant differences within type \(e.g. between citizens’ assemblies, citizens’ juries, deliberative polls, etc.\) and clarified the contested functions that DMPs can play within democratic political systems \[2\]. His research makes explicit the importance of design choices. Drawing on the historical use of sortition \(selection by lot\) in ancient Athens and in the contemporary practice of DMPs, he has shown the critical importance of combining random selection with clear mandate and regular rotation of membership if DMPs are to be institutionalised effectively \[3\]. Smith has also made the innovative argument for integrating citizens’ assemblies with independent offices for future generations as a way of ameliorating endemic short\-termism in democratic politics \[4\]. 

 Smith has undertaken ground\-breaking practice\-based research to show that citizens’ assemblies could be used effectively within the UK political system. Drawing on his research on DMPs in other advanced industrial democracies \(e.g. Australia, Canada, Ireland, United States\), Smith has been a co\-investigator on two major ESRC projects. The first, Democracy Matters, organised two citizens’ assemblies on devolution in the Solent and South Yorkshire regions. This project tested variations in design, specifically the effect of including local councillors alongside randomly selected citizens in the composition of the assembly. The project provides systematic evidence of the way in which the inclusion of politicians can have an effect on agenda\-setting and deliberation \[5\]. The project won the UK Political Studies Association’s  [2016](https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/PSA%20Awards%20Brochure%202016.pdf) Democratic Innovations Award for its “innovative and deliberative” approach and “potential for shaping future democratic reforms and the devolution of power at local and regional level”. The second project, Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit \(CAB\), took place in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum and tasked participants with considering the UK’s trading relationship with the EU and its future immigration policy. The CAB provides robust evidence of the importance of using attitudinal criteria in the recruitment of participants \(in this case, the Brexit vote\) alongside more traditional socio\-demographic criteria to avoid skewing membership. It also provides further evidence of the capacity of citizens to deliberate on highly contentious and complex policy issues. The design of the CAB shows the effectiveness of prioritising the role of professional facilitation over leadership by an appointed high\-profile chair, as had been the case in the Democracy Matters pilots and previous citizens’ assemblies in Canada and Ireland \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  \(1\) Impact on the Delivery of Citizens’ Assemblies in the UK 

 The Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit \(CAB\) pilot project, organised by Smith and colleagues, has **played a critical role in the application of citizens’ assemblies in the UK at both national and local levels.** 

 *At the national level.* Tim Hughes, Director of the participation charity Involve, states that **the CAB provided a “proof of concept… very important for the development of Citizens’ Assemblies in the UK**” \[1a\]. In the wake of the CAB, UK parliamentary committees commissioned two high\-profile citizens’ assemblies to inform their inquiries: the Citizens’ Assembly on Social Care \(CASC\) in 2018 and the Climate Assembly UK \(CAUK\) in 2020. Both assemblies were delivered by Involve, and Hughes is clear that **these national CAs would not have happened without the earlier CAB**: “there is a clear chain from the Brexit one happening to the social care one happening and being possible… The climate one wouldn’t be happening without the social care one” \[1a\]. Hughes further confirms that the proof of concept provided by CAB “was incredibly helpful in having conversations with first the Clerks and then the Chairs of the Committees in Parliament… it helped to give them confidence that this has been done before, that there is a clear process that is tried and tested on the most contested topic of the time”, and “it has helped us set the agenda in a way that would have been much harder without doing it” \[1a\]. Drawing on insights from his research \(especially output \[3\]\), Smith’s advice on organising the CAUK into sub\-assemblies to deal with the complexity of climate policy was adopted in its final design. The CAUK also integrated an attitudinal criterion \(concern about climate change\) into its recruitment process, directly drawing from the practice of the CAB \[1a\]. 

 Secondary impacts of these national CAs can be clearly discerned. For example, Clive Betts MP, Chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, and Sarah Wollaston MP, Chair of the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee \(MHCLG\), are clear that “using a Citizens’ Assembly \[CASC\] helped their committees find a consensus and produce a unanimous joint report for their recent \[2018\] inquiry into the long\-term funding of adult social care, in an important innovation in select committee practice” \[1b\]. The recommendations of CAUK, published in September 2020, received significant media coverage and have already been used by the UK Committee on Climate Change to shape the UK’s Sixth Carbon Budget, launched in December 2020. As the Committee states: “The UK Climate Assembly provided useful insights on the priorities of a representative cross\-section of the UK population. These priorities are reflected in this report” \[1c, p.24\]. For instance, its net zero pathway “\[i\]s designed to be delivered in a way that works for people – reflects their priorities and choices, and aligns very well to the preferences expressed by the Climate Assembly \[CAUK\], which was called by six Select Committees of the House of Commons to understand public views on how the UK should tackle climate change” \[1c, p.49\]. 

 *At the local level*: Miriam Levin, former Head of Community Action at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sports \(DCMS\), confirms that Smith’s work was **critical in obtaining government funding for, and determining the design of, the DCMS and Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s** **\(MHCLG\) Innovation in Democracy programme** \[1d\], which ran from November 2018 to March 2020. Regarding government investment into this programme, Levin writes: “The Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit and Democracy Matters \(DM\) assemblies demonstrated that the methodology could be used to enable ordinary people to work through the most contentious issues to reach a consensus on the way forward. It gave me as a policymaker proof of concept, and the ability to convince junior ministers and Secretaries of State in DCMS and MHCLG to back and fund the trial of citizens’ assemblies” \[1e\]. The funding enabled three local authorities to commission citizens’ assemblies, and Levin notes: “ **The model of citizens’ assemblies as successfully demonstrated by CAB and DM formed the basis for the design of the Innovation in Democracy assemblies**. We drew heavily on their best practice, including appointing independent facilitators, running the assemblies over two full weekends and paying honorariums to the participants” \[1e\], elements specified in research outputs \[5\] and \[6\]. 

#  \(2\) Advising UK Parliamentarians on Appropriate Use of Citizen Assemblies 

 Neal Lawson, Executive Director of Compass, a leading UK political think tank, states that Smith should be credited for his “impact on the nature of the national political discourse around developing democracy, because if \[he\] hadn’t done all of that work and had all of those insights we wouldn’t be anywhere near the conversations we are now having on new forms of deliberative democracy” \[2a\]. In particular, Smith has worked to **ensure citizens’ assemblies are not misused, thus safeguarding their continued viability in political discourse and action**. 

 Inspired by the CAB pilot project, in 2018\-19, in the run up to the parliamentary vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement, a number of parliamentarians, led by Stella Creasy MP, Lisa Nandy MP and Caroline Lucas MP, made the case publicly for a government\-commissioned citizens’ assembly on Brexit \[2b\]. Their argument was that the Brexit referendum gave no indication of what Brexit should look like. Smith spoke at private parliamentary briefings and a full\-capacity meeting in Parliament alongside Creasy, Nandy and Lucas. The level of understanding amongst parliamentarians about citizens’ assemblies was low and as Lawson, one of the campaign organisers states, the “reassurance, particularly of an academic who doesn’t have an axe to grind on this, was absolutely essential” \[2a\]. Smith agreed to join a select number of high\-profile individuals, including Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and then Senior Rabbi to Reform Judaism **Laura Janner\-Klausner,** in signing a widely reported letter in *The Guardian* in support of the idea of a Brexit assembly \[2c\]. However, when it became clear that a significant extension to Article 50 would not be forthcoming, Smith was part of the group, including colleagues from the Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit project \(from UCL Constitution Unit and Involve\), that **persuaded these MPs not to move forward with the Brexit citizens’ assembly proposal.** A robust and independent assembly would require months of organisation to recruit members and provide the space for deliberation and time for parliament to consider recommendations. The political conditions were not favourable for such a process and Smith and colleagues were able to convince the parliamentarians to avoid delivering a citizens’ assembly that did not meet the appropriate standards \[2a\]. 

#  \(3\) Impact on the Design of the Permanent Citizens’ Dialogue, Belgium 

 The reach of Smith’s impact is evidenced by his “instrumental” role in **the design of the world’s first permanent Citizens’ Dialogue based on random selection** established by the Parliament of the German\-speaking community of Belgium \[3a, 3b\]. Smith was invited by the G1000 Foundation in Belgium to be part of a three\-day international expert design workshop that had been commissioned by the Parliament to consider how best to integrate a permanent mechanism to integrate citizens’ assemblies into its work. The proposal generated by the expert design team was adopted unanimously by Parliament without revision on 25<sup>th</sup> February 2019 and was implemented later that year \[3b\]. 

 The final design of the Citizens’ Dialogue draws explicitly on Smith’s research on the importance of combining random selection with a clear mandate that distinguishes between tasks of agenda\-setting and scrutiny and features regular rotation of membership \(research output \[3\]\). Smith’s central role in establishing these novel design features is confirmed by Yves Dejaeghere, one of the G1000 convenors: “we had the idea of a single second chamber, which would have people sitting for two years or longer”, however a “lot of the **questioning from Graham Smith… going back to the experience he had… made us change that idea**. So, it avoided us going down a direction that I think now would have been a much less appropriate design” \[3b\]. Dejaeghere adds: “how the decision process is made to set the agenda, all these things were designed in the Bill with the help of… Graham Smith” \[3b\]. 

 The Citizens’ Dialogue is constituted by a permanent Citizens’ Council of 24 randomly selected citizens who have taken part in previous citizens’ assemblies. Its membership is regularly rotated with 8 members being replaced every six months. The Council takes on the agenda\-setting role, taking evidence from parliament, government and civil society and deciding independently on which issues should then be scrutinised by citizens’ assemblies. Parliament and government are required to respond publicly to recommendations from assemblies within 6 months. The Citizens’ Council met for the first time in September 2019 and established its first citizens’ assembly on employment in social care in early 2020. 

 The novel design of the Ostbelgien process is **widely acclaimed as a “trailblazer” in the politics of citizens’ assemblies** \[3c\] and has received extensive international interest from publications including *The* *Economist*, *El Pais* and *Der Spiegel* \[3d\]. *The* *Economist* referred to the dialogue as an innovation “that Aristotle would have approved of” \[3e\]. 

#  \(4\) Pedagogical Impact on Extinction Rebellion 

 A key demand of Extinction Rebellion \(XR\) is the establishment of a national citizens’ assembly on the climate and ecological emergency. XR reached out to Smith to help activists think through what this would mean in practice. Smith has provided ongoing advice and support, including the organisation of three days of design workshops in the first half of 2019 at the University of Westminster, where academic and practical experts in citizens’ assemblies worked with XR activists. 

 A member of the XR Citizens’ Assembly \(XRCA\) Working Group explains how Smith has **enabled XR to be clearer about its demands and expectations of the citizens’ assembly process**: “Before these workshops I don't think any of us had any idea of how in practice the CA for Climate and Ecological Justice was going to work… It gave us the knowledge and confidence we needed to properly communicate with a wider audience about citizens' assemblies” \[4a\]. The former convenor of the XRCA working group adds that such knowledge has been “conveyed to MPs on several different occasions, including my meeting with Michael Gove” \[4b\]. Smith provided XR activists with “ **an understanding of design** so as a group we could make critical comments on the climate assemblies that have ensued, at both local and national levels” \[4a\]. 

 As with the parliamentary Brexit debate, Smith has not been an advocate for citizens’ assemblies at any price. He played an influential role in persuading XR not to rush into running its own citizens’ assembly as part of its International Rebellion in April 2019: “ **Graham convinced us that… if XR runs a citizens’ assembly we will discredit the idea** as people will see citizens’ assemblies as tools that campaign/lobby groups use, rather than a trusted democratic process that represents the views of the country” \[4b\]. 

#  \(5\) Impact on Today For Tomorrow 

 Smith has been instrumental in shaping the Today For Tomorrow campaign that aims to enshrine a UK Wellbeing of Future Generations Bill \[5a\]. The campaign, led by Lord Bird MBE, the founder of *The* *Big Issue* magazine, reached out to Smith in his position as Chair of the Foundation for Democracy and Sustainable Development \( [FDSD](https://www.fdsd.org/)\) to help build support for the bill and to develop its content. The Bill builds on earlier Welsh legislation and had its first reading in parliament on 8 January 2020. Its passage has been delayed by the impact of Covid\-19 on parliamentary business. 

 Oliver Sidorczuk, former Advisor to Lord Bird states that Smith’s input to the drafting of the Bill “improves on the Welsh legislation” \[5b\]. Drawing explicitly on his academic work \(particularly output \[4\]\), Smith proposed the incorporation of citizens’ assemblies to determine wellbeing goals and oversee the work of a UK Future Generations Commissioner. Sidorczuk states: “These improvements to the bill, suggested and drafted by Graham, **place citizens at the heart of a new, sustainable, democratic decision\-making model and would not be in the draft legislation without his guidance and expertise”** \[5b\]. 

 Smith facilitated a workshop at the University of Westminster on 13 November 2019 of core stakeholders from across the public, private and voluntary sector to understand and address areas of contention, and to build support for the bill; he formally presented the bill to over 50 MPs and Peers at its parliamentary launch on 12 January 2020; and he addressed civil society leaders at a reception for its launch at the House of Lords the same evening. Sidorczuk confirms that Smith’s “ **expertise, leadership, and knowledge… professionalised and propelled our campaign in an extremely crowded political space**, setting the Today For Tomorrow and the private member’s bill on the best possible footing for the future” \[5b\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Immigrants with low levels of literacy or schooling in their first language face significant economic and social barriers in a new host country. Due to a lack of resources and research\-informed guidance for teaching and assessment of these learners, individuals are often restricted from achieving their full potential. Research undertaken by Dr Rola Naeb at Northumbria University has fostered new approaches to language\-learning among adult migrants, and the pedagogic methods employed by teaching practitioners in the UK, Europe, and North America. These new approaches have \(1\) provided vital insights that underpinned the creation of a new professional training package \(EU\-Speak\), and the development of an online digital literacy instructor platform \(DigLin\), unlocking the transformative benefits of technology\-enhanced tools to address the needs of low literacy second language learners and teachers more effectively. And, \(2\) through her close work with policymakers at the Council of Europe, Naeb’s insights also informed the creation of a new framework of reference to improve the integration of refugees and migrants across the EU.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Host/dominant language acquisition \(e.g., learning English for immigrants to the UK\) is essential for accessing social, economic, health, and educational services, as well as obtaining citizenship and residency. Most teachers of low\-literate, culturally diverse learners, however, lack sufficient knowledge of adult second language acquisition and related appropriate pedagogical approaches, methods, and techniques. Drawing on her expertise in technology\-enhanced learning, since joining Northumbria in 2013, Naeb has pursued solutions to these challenges through an iterative research process which draws on both the ongoing teaching and assessment of low\-literate migrant learners, and the insights revealed through that learning activity. The results have provided new insights into language acquisition as well as improving pedagogy and resources in the field \[ **R1**\- **R6**\]. 

 Naeb’s research has explored urgent questions regarding the host language learning experience of low\-literate adults and culturally diverse learners: what the needs of LESLLA \(Literacy Education and Second Language Learning for Adults\) learners are, how these can be met by new learning materials, and how far optimum pedagogical approaches improve the standard of second language learning amongst low\-level learners \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Over the course of her research, Naeb highlighted key drawbacks in traditional teaching and assessment and how traditional assessment models do not accurately capture the experience of non/low\-literate learners \[ **R2**\]. 

 Naeb’s ongoing research in this field has been facilitated by her role as the lead for Northumbria’s involvement in a multi\-phase, European Commission funded literacy project. In collaboration with Professor Martha Young\-Scholten \(Newcastle University\) and an international consortium, from 2013\-18 Naeb was co\-investigator on EU\-Speak3, a project which sought to develop and analyse a specialist CPD online programme for LESLLA teachers, comprising six distinct, distance learning modules \(in English, Finnish, German, Spanish and Turkish language formats\). Naeb’s research explored how the use of accessible, online professional training could enhance the theoretical knowledge and professional practice of LESLLA practitioners \[ **R3**, **R4**\].  Findings indicated how this type of remote learning package could help to improve pedagogical skills\-sets, irrespective of the amount of teaching experience an individual may possess. An evaluation of teachers, trainers, and programme managers, which received over a hundred responses, also confirmed how on\-line provision could help to facilitate a specialist community of practice among European countries and even other continents \[ **R3**, **R4**\]. 

 Naeb’s ongoing research was also facilitated through her involvement \(again, as the lead researcher for Northumbria\) with the EU\-funded multilateral ‘Digital Literacy Instructor’ project \(DigLin\). Running from 2013\-15, Naeb’s research analysed the use of Computer\-Assisted Language Learning \(CALL\) – advanced learning materials that allow individualisation of instruction and learner\-focused learning \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. These systems allow learners to progress at their own level and pace, whenever and wherever they want, supporting language acquisition among immigrant communities in a host country. Naeb’s research demonstrated that phonics\-based online materials provide the best opportunity to meet the diverse needs of LESLLA learners, by helping to enhance decoding skills whilst providing a motivating and stimulating learning experience \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. 

 In short, Naeb’s insights reveal how a combination of new technology and better understanding of LESLLA learner needs can offer global solutions to the language challenges that arise from global migration. As her research demonstrates, they can assist in the provision of basic training to migrants with little experience of formal education and they can provide support to teachers, both in their acquisition of teaching skills specific to LESLLA learners and with their professional development \[ **R1**\- **R6**\]. 

 The originality and strength of the research is reflected in Naeb’s election in September 2020 as President of Literacy Education and Second Language Learning for Adults \(LESLLA\) – the first and principal international organisation to focus on second language acquisition for adults from an immigrant/refugee\-background. Through ongoing involvement with the annual symposium, conferences, and associated media events, Naeb’s research has been shared among the organisation’s extensive community of practice. This important work has allowed Naeb to highlight the importance of digital learning platforms for educationally disadvantaged people and to help increase the knowledge base among LESLLA practitioners.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Naeb at Northumbria has 1\) played a key role in supporting the development of a new professional training package \(EU\-Speak\), and an innovative phonics\-based tool \(DigLin\). Naeb’s vital contribution to these innovative linguistic platforms resulted in an intuitive and tailored approach that is highly responsive to individual learning needs. In addition to providing organisations such as LESLLA \(Literacy Education and Second Language Learning for Adults\) with new knowledge about improved teaching practices and the acquisition of grammar, Naeb’s work with the Council of Europe has 2\) helped to produce a new framework of reference to support migrant learners across the EU. 

 **4.1 Supporting the creation and successful use of new digital learning packages** 

 Naeb’s insights relating to the acquisition and assessment of grammatical skills underpinned the design of module six for the EU\-speak3 learning package, a contribution described as ‘ *assiduous*’ by the project lead \[ **E1a**\]. Naeb’s expertise in human technology interface also informed the interactive design for the other programme modules, which ‘ *considerably enhanced’* their design and content \[ **E1a**\]. Over 900 participants, from 47 different countries \[ **E1a**; **E1b**, p1\], enrolled on the EU\-Speak3 training modules from 2015\-18, designed to enhance the vital work done by paid and volunteer teachers of LESLLA learners from all over the world \[ **E1a**; **E1c**, p2\]. Evaluation showed that module six had improved knowledge among the practitioners about literary education and had helped their practice with LESLLA learners \[ **E1a**; **E1c**, p23\]. Following the end of the initial project in 2018, the EU\-speak board was formed, with Northumbria and Naeb’s research continuing to play a central role in informing the ongoing expansion and development of EU\-speak content, including publication of a Module Compendium \(co\-edited by Naeb\) \[ **E1d**, p3\]. 

 Since 2015, Naeb’s research has made an equally ‘ *essential*’ contribution to the development of DigLin, an online digital literacy instructor platform that supports LESLLA learners \(funded by the European Lifelong Learning Programme\) \[ **E2**\]. Through an analysis of logging data generated from user\-behaviour tracking technologies, Naeb’s work proved intrinsic to improving the targeted content and intuitive design of the digital platform \[ **E2**\]. The developers confirmed how Naeb’s ‘ *research and expertise was essential in the development of the* platform … \[resulting in the creation of\] *an advanced full* \[English\] *text level with more than 1,500 resources \(multimedia texts, exercises\), 13,000 sound files \(sounds, words, sentences and texts\) and 5,600 images’* \[ **E2**\]. 

 In partnership with colleagues at Friesland College \(Netherlands\), and Granada University \(Spain\), Naeb developed the entire content for the English materials, as well as supporting the roll out of the Dutch and Spanish versions \[ **E2**; **E3a**\]. Naeb’s research underpinned the platform’s effective deployment of globally accessible technology enhanced learning \(TEL\) materials to improve pedagogy and inform a wider community of practice. A field evaluation undertaken in all participating countries, which collated sample feedback from 15 teachers and 40 interviews with learners, indicated that learners exceeded many of their teachers’ expectations and developed skills ‘ *that they thought* \[they\] *were incapable of achieving*’ \[ **E3b**, p37\]. 

 The Curriculum Leader for English for Speakers of Other Languages \(ESOL\) at Newcastle College \(UK\) confirmed how DigLin has been vital in supporting their role as a major provider of English language education \[ **E4**\]. A recipient of the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education \(the most significant form of national recognition awarded to a UK academic or vocational institution\), Newcastle College has approximately 1,000 adult learners enrolling each year from all parts of the world. In response to concerns about attainment levels, the college turned to Naeb’s phonics\-based research, which ‘ *demonstrated how technology\-enhanced learning tools can address the multi\-level/multi\-background challenge most teachers face when working with non/low\-literate adult migrant learners*’ \[ **E4**\]. 

 Newcastle College outlined the benefits they derived from the ‘ *innovative user\-behaviour tracking technologies*’ \[ **E4**\]. These have made it ‘ *possible* \[for teaching staff\] *to monitor, record, and assess all interactions, helping learning practitioners to better monitor individual learners’ progress*’ \[ **E4**\]. The non\-linear structure of DigLin allowed teaching staff to ‘ *direct each learner to a suitable activity or a learner can follow their own path to learning*’ \[ **E4**\]. This new ‘ *tailored learning* *combined with immediate feedback addresses the frustration that LESLLA learners usually experience when dealing with educational and literacy settings for the first time*’ \[ **E4**\]. Since May 2018, DigLin has become central to the delivery for low\-level learners of English at Newcastle College: ‘ *the incorporation of DigLin into our teaching resources … has proved to be a fantastic resource which has enabled us to provide the tailored support that our students require, both on\-site and at home*’ \[ **E4**\]. The tool has helped the teaching staff ‘ *to feel much more confident about* \[their\] *ability to successfully teach phonics to this group of students and has encouraged us to improve our provision by adding an extra lesson per week for pre\-entry students focused on phonics work*’ \[ **E4**\]. 

 The ESOL leader at Newcastle College confirmed how DigLin ‘ *has undoubtedly boosted attainment and retention rates among our students … the clear and positive impact of this resource on students means I can safely say that DigLin is now the cornerstone of what we wish pre\-entry ESOL students to use in order to study English’* \[ **E4**\]. The College also highlighted the importance of their students’ ability to access DigLin at home ‘ *they are now able to revise and/or complete sessions flexibly, in their own time, around work and childcare responsibilities. This … has been particularly useful this year* \[during COVID\-19 pandemic\], *as it has enabled students to continue with their education despite the social restrictions*’ \[ **E4**\]. 

 Friesland College offered a similar positive appraisal of the benefits they have seen from their collaboration with Northumbria. Offering fulltime and part\-time training programmes to approximately 9,500 students, the college is a major provider of adult education and language courses. The college noted how ‘ *the novel logging system … inspired by Dr. Naeb’s research is now used in the Dutch platform which has been commercialised by Boom and Friesland College and is now used by more than 7,000 learners and several institutions. It is also used in the English platform which is used since 2015 by 15,000 learners from 104 countries accessing around 250,000 resources in total’* \[ **E2**\]. Naeb’s research\-informed tracking system was later used for the Finnish, French, German and Spanish platforms, with Friesland College confirming how it has been ‘ *praised by teachers and practitioners using the … platform in all its languages’* \[ **E2**\]. 

 The benefits of DigLin have also been felt in other types of learning environment. The Digital Learning Facilitator for the CLEAR Project – a Southampton based education charity and leading provider of specialist advice and educational opportunities for Southampton’s refugee and migrant communities – confirmed that ‘ *DigLin was, quite simply, unlike any other resources we had previously used’* \[ **E5**\]. Established in 2001, CLEAR is the leading provider of ESOL in Southampton, supporting individuals who are not ready for college or have struggled to progress without tailored ESOL support \[ **E5**\]. Introduced during the 2018\-19 academic year, the facilitator noted how the ‘ *unique structure* \[of DigLin\] *has really helped learners with no understanding of letter sounds or phonic blending/segmenting to get started with this element of the English language’* \[ **E5**\] These novel techniques proved ‘ *especially beneficial*’ for those reliant on services provided by CLEAR, ‘ *aiding simultaneous development of their vocabulary, reading, and spelling*’ \[ **E5**\]. 

 The CLEAR facilitator cited multiple examples from learners \[ **E5**, p3\-4\], where DigLin ‘ *led to marked progress in student’s ability to sound out letters/words, phonics skills, and reading ability*’ \[ **E5**\]. The facilitator also noted how the online functionality ‘ *finally enabled us to fill a gap in our digital provision for our ESOL courses. This has proved particularly vital for some learners in 2020, as COVID\-19 restricted our ability to teach face\-to\-face classes’* \[ **E5**\]. CLEAR have noted that ‘ *it would not have been possible for us to successfully provide the depth of support that we have been able to throughout 2020 without access to DigLin’* \[ **E5**\]. The organisation now also use DigLin to support individualised learning for smaller groups who speak English fluently but have almost no literacy, a discrepancy that often resulted in individuals falling between the gaps in terms of language development, ‘ *DigLin is perfect … as they can adapt how they use the website to meet their personal needs*’ \[ **E5**\]. DigLin ‘ *is now embedded into* \[CLEAR’s\] *future ESOL provision for the longer term*’ \[ **E5**\]. 

 **4.2 Establishing a European Frame of Reference for LESLLA Pedagogy** 

 The Council of Europe \(CE\) has drawn on Naeb’s expertise to develop a European framework of reference for second language and literacy. Since 2018, in collaboration with 6 linguistic specialists \[ **E6**, p1\-2\], Naeb’s research has helped to inform and update the existing CE guidelines, used by language practitioners all over Europe \[ **E6**, p2, p7\-8\]. The new framework \(expected completion, 2021\) provides the skeleton for European\-wide syllabi and tests that brings non\-literate adult migrants to A1 literacy \(the basic, beginner language level formalised by the CE\) \[ **E6**, p2\-4\]. Until now, no such framework existed, meaning that non\-schooled and low\-educated adult migrants did not receive structured learning support and were therefore falling through the net \[ **E6**, p5, p7\-8\]. The new framework supports the wider aim of CE’s Linguistic Integration of Adult Migrants project, to help EU member states to meet the needs of adult migrants and to promote social cohesion and full participation in the democratic process \[ **E6**, p5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Rebecca Cassidy has conducted anthropological fieldwork on the commercial gambling industry for almost twenty years, during a period of rapid and unprecedented global expansion. Her research led to the introduction of the first ethical code for stakeholders; new disclosure policies for researchers, and changes to how parliamentarians think about gambling policy, including the industry\-backed model of ‘responsible gambling’. By informing government policies, industry practices and public debates nationally and worldwide, Cassidy’s research has benefitted policy\-makers, regulators and members of the public, including those harmed by gambling, and their families. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Cassidy’s research uses ethnographic fieldwork to explore the global expansion of commercial gambling, including the role played in that process by research. She has proposed changes to policy and practices which have been enacted in the UK and internationally. 

 The research underpinning these changes to gambling research and policy originated in Cassidy’s PhD. As part of her investigation of the UK horseracing industry in Newmarket, she worked with bookmakers, professional gamblers and punters on the racecourse and in off track betting shops. After her PhD, a British Academy postdoc enabled her to extend this work with gamblers, jockeys and trainers on racetracks in the United States. 

 Between 2006 and 2009 Cassidy held a joint ESRC/Responsibility in Gambling Trust \(RiGT\) award which used fieldwork in betting shops to problematize the idea of ‘problem gambling’ and the categorical identification of people as ‘problem gamblers’. It also supported two PhD studentships which focused on the impact of this discourse on UK gamblers born in China and living in London \(Claire Loussouarn\) and in Manchester \(Eva Liu\). The purpose of this work was to promote an ethnographic approach to the global commercial gambling industry as an alternative to psychological framings which emphasise the individual as the source of both problems with gambling and also as the site of solutions to those problems \(in the form of self\-discipline/therapy\). When a member of the senior management of the RiGT \(a charity funded by voluntary contributions from the industry, recently renamed ‘GambleAware’\) attempted to prevent her from speaking in public about her research Cassidy also began to investigate more closely the ethics and politics of gambling research, including funding. 

 In 2010 Cassidy established a small team \(Sam Kelly, Claire Loussouarn, Andrea Pisac and Julie Scott\) to widen the ethnographic investigation of commercial gambling, supported by a European Research Council \(ERC\) Starting Grant. The team conducted fieldwork with the online gambling industry \(RC\), spread betting firms in Europe \(CL\), land\-based gaming in Cyprus \(JS\) and gamblers and non\-gamblers in the Italo\-Slovenian borderlands \(AP\). Outputs include an interdisciplinary, edited collection that uses a comparative approach to explore the insertion of commercial gambling into particular societies \(including those without a history of legal gambling\), and the problems and opportunities that process creates \(R1\)\). 

 The team also continued to investigate the relations of production of gambling research in the UK, Europe, North America and Australasia. The resulting open access report, *Fair Game*, provided clear evidence that gambling research was poor quality and lacked independence \(R2\). Using interviews with 109 stakeholders including researchers, members of the industry, policy makers and treatment providers it found that; a\) Gambling cultures are no longer confined by national boundaries, nor is gambling separable from other kinds of risk taking including speculation on financial markets and playing online games; b\) Qualitative studies of gambling can produce robust insights that are capable of supporting policy; c\) What counts as ‘evidence’ in this field is determined by political, rather than public health priorities; d\) The international field of gambling studies is close knit and tightly controlled by the industry and the state both through access to funding and to data. *Fair Game* prompted *International Gambling Studies* to introduce a disclosure policy \(R3\). 

 In 2016 Cassidy was invited to participate in the creation of The International Research Alliance on Public Health Governance in order to share knowledge across different areas of public heath and make more effective interventions in public policy. Outputs document the ways in which the gambling, alcohol, tobacco and junk food industries use the idea of ‘complexity’ to derail changes to policy \(R5\). Also, in 2016, Cassidy conducted the first research on gambling advertising during sporting broadcasts in the UK \(2017, with Niko Ovenden\) finding that the volume, duration and frequency were higher than in Australia before a ban on gambling adverts was introduced by the government \(R4\). In 2018 she developed this work \(with staff and students in Goldsmiths Anthropology department and colleagues at Deakin University\) to investigate children’s awareness and recall of gambling brands, prompting a wide\-ranging debate in the UK, including in the House of Lords. 

 In 2020, Cassidy published *Vicious Games*, a monograph drawing upon twenty years of fieldwork across multiple gambling sites around the world \(R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The expansion of commercial gambling is an issue of public concern in the UK, Europe, Australia, North America, New Zealand and Asia. Cassidy’s research has had a high\-profile role in public debates about the social production of gambling policy, the flaws of the ‘responsible gambling’ approach to regulation, the volume of gambling advertising on television, and the conduct of gambling research. It has been used by: a\) parliamentarians seeking to change policy; b\) charities seeking to influence policy and public opinion; c\) members of the public seeking to resist the expansion of commercial gambling in their locality; d\) funders and policy makers seeking to reform the evidence base and e\) the media trying to influence policy and public debate. 

 **4.1 Impacts on Government and Opposition Policy:** 

 The ERC project policy report, Fair Game, had its findings incorporated into the House of Commons briefing paper on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals \(FOBT\) \[S1\]. In 2018, the Conservative government reduced the maximum stakes on FOBTs from £100 to £2. 

 In 2017 findings from a paper on the volume, frequency and duration of gambling adverts during broadcasts of English Premier League football \(R4\) were quoted extensively by members during a debate about children and gambling in the House of Lords, with the intention of changing the outcome of the Government review of gambling policy on gambling advertising \[S2\]. The paper \(R4\) was also used by the Labour Party to call for a review of gambling and changes in policy including the creation of a levy to fund research and a ban on gambling advertising on footballer’s shirts, as reported in the Guardian and by BBC and ITV television \[S3\]. 

 On 20 July 2018 Cassidy wrote to the Gambling Commission reiterating requests made during a meeting earlier that week, asking them to adopt a public health approach to gambling, remove all references to ‘responsible gambling’ from the new strategy, for the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board to be renamed, and for the creation of a data hub accessible to independent researchers. The new National Strategy of Gambling Harm \(2019\) made all of these changes. A member of the Gambling Commission confirmed: “One area that is likely to feature is the development of a data hub into which operators would be expected to report specified data sets. Researchers would then be able to access that data without the need to negotiate access from operators. Rebecca\- you can take credit for planting that seed in my mind\!” \[S10\]. 

 In 2019 Tom Watson, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, gave a speech announcing that the Labour Party would be writing a new Gambling Bill. Cassidy was the only academic referred to in the speech \[S4\]. 

 **4.2 Influencing Government Action**: 

 The Campaign for Fairer Gambling provided copies of Fair Game to all of the parliamentarians they briefed on the triennial consultation on stakes and prizes in 2016. A member of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Racing described it as “a volcano for the mind”. On 9 April 2014 Caroline Lucas, MP, used the report as the basis for questions to the Government about the independence of funding for gambling research \[S10\]. 

 After reading Fair Game \(R2\) in June 2017, Welsh Minister Simon Thomas tweeted a link to the report saying that “@AssemblyWales will soon gain limited powers over \#gambling. This report http://www.gold.ac.uk/gamblingineurope/report/ ...@ProfRCassidy shows the work we have to do” \[S10\] Other examples of Cassidy’s influence on Government include: 

-  In 2017 Cassidy provided background and reviews for a Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology briefing note on ‘ [Researching Gambling](https://post.parliament.uk/approved-researching-gambling/)’. 

-  In 2019 Cassidy testified before the cross\-party gambling group in Cardiff and worked with Beat the Odds and the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Wales and Deacon University to create the first Welsh youth gambling forum, sponsored by Assembly Member Darren Millar. 

-  In 2019, Cassidy was appointed Specialist Advisor to the House of Lords Select Committee on the Social and Economic Impact of the Gambling Industry. The committee reported in July 2020. 

 Cassidy advised the Select Committee to adopt a public health approach to gambling and reject the language of ‘problem gambling’. Experts by Experience who gave evidence in October 2019 wrote that: “I’m really proud that the use of the term ‘problem gambling’ within the Lords set\-up was translated to ‘disordered gambling’. I was told that to get this change would be a mountainous task. Thank you to the likes of @ProfRCassidy‬ for being a part of this change” \[S10\]‬.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬ 

 In July 2020, Lord Grade, chair of the committee, presented 66 recommendations to Parliamentarians and the public. Cassidy’s contribution is acknowledged in paragraph 25 of the report \[S5\]. On 2 July Lord Grade wrote to Cassidy: “As our specialist adviser for the first half of our inquiry you pointed us in the right direction, helped set our agenda in the call for evidence, identified many of the essential witnesses, and helped us with written and oral briefing. We would not have got where we did without your guidance, and I hope you will feel that the report does you justice.” A review of gambling policy by the government is due to take place in 2020 \[S6\]. Since the launch of the government review of the Gambling Act in December 2020, Cassidy has been involved in advising Peers for Gambling Reform \(the largest cross\-party group in the Lords, dedicated to implementing the 66 recommendations made by the Select Committee\). 

 **4.3 Impacts on international policy and debates:** 

 In 2019 in Istanbul, Cassidy participated in the inaugural meeting of the World Health Organisation panel on gambling. The purpose of the meeting was to develop recommendations for WHO’s further program activities in this area. Cassidy’s research featured in a documentary about gambling regulation for Japanese National Television \(Somo Somo, 2015\). In 2020, Vicious Games \(R6\) was translated into Japanese. In 2019 the New Zealand Problem Gambling Foundation reported that “delegates found your research inspiring in its courage and authenticity. Your presence and presentations have given impetus to the programme for change in Aotearoa” \[S10\]. In 2019 and 2020 Cassidy contributed to the Public Health England \(PHE\) Gambling\-related harms evidence review, The National Institute of Health Research’s review of the effectiveness of national and international polices and interventions to reduce gambling\-related harms. She also advised the Institute of Alcohol Studies and Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems \(SHAAP\) on future research initiatives. 

 **4.4 Prompting changes to industry practices:** 

 In 2018 the broadcaster Sky limited gambling adverts to one per commercial break, and introduced blocking technology. Before announcing the changes, Sky wrote to Cassidy saying, “When we met earlier this year we had a great conversation about action we could take as a broadcaster. I think this is a positive step, but interested to know how you see this and happy to catch up again.” In 2019 Cassidy shared her research with all English Premier League teams sponsored by gambling companies. Huddersfield and Swansea City football clubs made replica shirts without gambling logos available to under 18s. An industry consultant wrote to Cassidy describing this as a “small victory” \[S10\]. 

 **4.5 Promoting independent alternatives to industry funded research:** 

 Policy makers internationally have described themselves as hampered by a lack of robust, high quality evidence on which to base gambling regulation. Cassidy’s research has improved the quality of the evidence base by creating new standards for funding, disclosure and ethical review. 

 Following the publication of Fair Game \(R2\), she was invited to write an editorial in *International Gambling Studies*, in which she called for a new, transparent framework for research. The journal responded by adopting a new disclosure policy \[S7\]. *The Journal of Asian Gambling Studies* followed suit. In 2017 Cassidy drafted, with Francis Markham, a new ethical code for professional gambling researchers. She presented this code at a meeting of the International Think Tank on Gambling Research and Policy in Auckland in February 2018 where it received strong opposition from industry funded researchers before being endorsed by a majority of delegates. The code has since been endorsed by funders and policy makers including colleagues at the Alberta Gaming Research Institute, Gambling Research Exchange Ontario, Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand, Gambling and Addictions Research Centre, AUT, and the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation \[S8\]. In 2019 the ethical code was one of the documents used as the basis of a discussion about the future of gambling research in the UK at a meeting of the Safer Gambling Board, a sub\-committee of the Gambling Commission. 

 In 2020, Fair Game \(R2\) and Vicious Games \(R6\) were two of the key publications referred to in the launch edition of the new journal of *Critical Gambling Studies* which embraces the principles outlined in the ethical code. The journal provides a space for independent research which meets the standards of disclosure recommended by Fair Game \(R2\) and demanded in other fields of public health. 

 **4.6 Challenging Public Debate:** 

 Cassidy’s research has consistently informed public debate and underpinned calls for changes to government policies, appearing in publications ranging from The Daily Mail to The New Statesman, via the Guardian, The New York Times, The Lancet, and The New Scientist \[S9\]. Other examples of Cassidy’s influence on public debate include: 

-  In 2019, Nature, a journal with an impact factor of 42.778, reported that “science has a gambling problem” based on interviews with Cassidy about her research. 

-  Cassidy’s research has been used by campaigners for gambling reform including the Church of England, Gambling With Lives, Gambling Watch and Beat the Fix. In 2020 Vicious Games \(R6\) was used to argue for gambling reform in a  [report by the Social Market Foundation](https://www.smf.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gambling-review-and-reform-August-2020.pdf). 

-  Cassidy has spoken about her research at Falling Walls \(2011\), on Thinking Allowed \(BBC Radio 4, 2014, 2020\) and advised the producers of Panorama \(BBC 1: 2018, 2020\) and the Victoria Derbyshire Program \(BBC 2, 2017\).

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Research by the Performing Identities \(PId\) research group, originating in Durham Law School, identified significant gaps in understandings of Northern Ireland’s \(NI\) significance to Brexit, especially across human rights, equality and citizenship. Both the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement \(GFA\) and the Common Travel Area \(CTA\) create an entirely separate Brexit context for NI which also shapes the structure of the withdrawal process and future relationships between the UK and EU and the UK and Ireland. 

 This research shaped the policies of key decision\-makers in the Brexit process, including: 

-  Parliamentarians in Westminster, Dublin and Belfast. 

-  Joint Committee of the Irish and Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissions. 

-  Civil services of the UK and Ireland. 

 Public discourses on Brexit have also been enriched by greater knowledge and understanding of the significance of alterations to NI law and policy on the rest of the UK and EU. 

 PId’s work shaped decisions made on human rights reform in the UK Parliament, and shaped the policy position and advocacy of the Joint Committee of the Irish and Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissions with regards to London, Dublin and EU politicians. The research led to changes in policy as regards to the Settled Status scheme and Irish citizens, and directly shaped the newly re\-coordinated structures of the CTA and human rights monitoring post Brexit. 
","
 **2.** **Underpinning research** 

 The PId team focuses on NI’s unique constitutional and international legal position within Brexit, with a particular focus on human rights, equality and citizenship. Considering a specific legal aspect of Brexit in isolation is impossible, there are always knock\-on effects especially in NI. The PId team’s combined expertise developed substantive answers to these complexities and O’Donoghue’s established expertise in Irish constitutional, international, human rights and trade law, as well as her experience of working with policy makers, formed a critical cross\-cutting core. The team possess combined expertise in: Irish constitutional law \(O’Donoghue, *Durham*\), international law \(O’Donoghue, Warwick, *Durham*\), UK constitutional law \(Murray, Warwick *Durham*\), civil and political rights, \(Murray\) economic and social rights \(Warwick, *Durham*\), EU law \(de Mars\), Trade \(O’Donoghue *Durham*, de Mars\). 

 The PId team first identified the significance of NI prior to the Brexit referendum in 2016, at a time when NI was being ignored in wider debates. In 2015, O’Donoghue and Warwick set out **\[R1\]** the potential difficulties NI posed for London based plans for human rights reform and Brexit. This article set the template to understand the mix of human rights, constitutional and trade issues that characterised Brexit and set out what specific aspects the UK and Irish Governments need to consider, especially the role of the GFA in ensuring rights across the island of Ireland are reciprocal, ever improving and the intertwining of trade and movement on the island and between Britain and Ireland. After the referendum PId’s research **\[R2\]** demonstrates that human rights and citizenship issues are intertwined with Brexit, with profound consequences with respect to trade \(O’Donoghue\), human rights \(Warwick, Murray\) and constitutional reform \(O’Donoghue, Murray\). The GFA necessity of reciprocal rights across the two jurisdictions on the island remains key to UK reforms. 

 PId’s established expertise on these issues, now recognised as pivotal, led to us being commissioned by the Joint Committee of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission \(Joint Committee\), the GFA mechanism by which Ireland and Northern Ireland’s statutory human rights bodies collaborate **. \[R3,5,6\]** The first was a 40,000\-word Discussion Paper on Brexit **\[R3\]**. This research, presented in January 2018, identified the serious consequences of the withdrawal deal outlined in the EU\-UK December 2017 Joint Paper, in particular: how the GFA was a fundamental factor shaping the Joint Paper’s terms on North\-South co\-operation, citizenship, human rights, security, and trade. It identified fundamental problems with the way in which the EU\-UK Joint Paper would work if put directly into legal form, including the creation of multiple new categories of rights holders and citizens. This is particularly critical in NI where parity of esteem is essential and the potential of two individuals, both born in NI, with different passports having different rights a serious concern and hence amongst the recommendations was maintaining equality of rights. 

 The team’s monograph **\[R4\]** sets out the legal historical context of why a specific NI approach is required. The book proves concentration on trade prevented deep reflection on how EU law would work in NI after Brexit and recommended a special status for NI \(akin to the backstop/NI Protocol\) to prevent an undermining of the peace process architecture. In August 2018, our 42,000 Report for the Joint Committee, was the first in depth research on the CTA, establishing that it did not provide a legal basis for personal rights for Irish and UK citizens. **\[R5\]** even as the UK Government repeatedly emphasised the significance of the CTA in smoothing border friction post Brexit. A combination of doctrinal, archival, and documentary research and interviews across Ireland, NI and Britain dispelled misunderstandings on the legal significance of the CTA in providing rights and detailed the steps necessary to transform the CTA to secure rights and obligations of people moving between and living in the UK and Ireland after Brexit, these included three options, with the second – a system of separate agreements between the UK and Irish Government, now established. Our Third Report for the Joint Committee ‘Continuing EU Citizenship after Brexit’ **\[R6\]** links human rights, citizenship and trade and non\- options available to Ireland, the UK, and the EU in the Northern Ireland context of non\-diminution of rights in the context of the complex citizenship. This Report recommends specific arrangements for those entitled to dual citizenship to secure their rights and the need to fully secure the residual EU rights of Irish citizens in the UK filled a critical gap in the existing analysis.

 **4.** **Details of the impact** 

 In the run up to the referendum and in its immediate aftermath, NI’s role in Brexit was consistently overlooked or misunderstood. PId was key to reframing the debate and situating NI as core to the Withdrawal process. PId’s impact has centred on issues of human rights, equality, citizenship and the CTA. 

####  Influencing public debate: Media and Public Discourse 

 PId’s public engagement and policy work, including animations and policy briefs, drawing directly on our research, informed, shifted and set the parameters on which NI and Brexit came to be eventually considered a serious facet of Brexit amongst the general population and media. The project team published more than 30 blog pieces and newspaper opinion pieces on Brexit. Between 2015 and 2020 O’Donoghue was, amongst others, interviewed by *The Irish Times, der Standard* and *The New Yorker*, appeared on BBC Breakfast \(20 August 2019\), France 24 \(24 September 2019, 13 October 2020, Today FM \(Irish national radio\) over 30 times and RTE Radio1. In the referendum’s immediate aftermath our policy brief on  [‘Brexit, Ireland and Northern Ireland](https://www.academia.edu/26337674/Policy_Paper_Brexit_Ireland_and_Northern_Ireland)’ \(2016\) was relied upon as some of the only in\-depth and up\-to\-date legal commentary on Brexit and NI **.** Journalist Emer O’Toole used the paper as the basis of an influential opinion piece in *The Guardian*. The piece, one of the first to tackle the legal reality of a likely return to a physical border used the policy paper as its basis quoting ‘UK\-Ireland border would represent an external border to the EU as a whole. There are no other “external” EU borders that do not come with border controls’ **\[E1\]**. Alongside this work, the project team has commissioned an innovative series of animations explaining Brexit’s impact on Northern Ireland;  [*Brexit and the Irish Border*](https://youtu.be/-wZ2q58_EVA),  [*Northern Ireland: Brexit, Peace and Prosperity*](https://youtu.be/CEqfipnFZqg) and  [*Brexit Holdem: Who to Watch as Brexit Unfolds*](https://youtu.be/-_rfpDai92o). These animations have been viewed on YouTube over 12,500 times. 

####  Shaped recommendations of UK and Irish Parliamentary Committees & Work of MPs 

 Our Policy Brief  [Brexit, Ireland and Northern Ireland](https://www.academia.edu/26337674/Policy_Paper_Brexit_Ireland_and_Northern_Ireland) 2016 was cited and endorsed in authoritative House of Commons Library Briefings on Brexit including our recommendation that the GFA requires a Northern Ireland specific solution. Our publications are also included in the Northern Ireland Assembly’s Brexit Reading List. Our detailed submissions to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, the EU Select Committee and the Irish Oireachtas’ Joint Committee on the Implementation of the GFA have drawn the parameters on which Northern Ireland operates since Brexit. 

 Pre the Brexit referendum, our evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee inquiry into ‘Northern Ireland and the EU referendum’ demonstrated that withdrawal from the ECHR, in the context of Northern Ireland must be treated separately. This was endorsed in the Committee’s final report and recommendations **\[E2a, p28\-29\]**. Further submissions to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee inquiry into ‘The Land Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland’ were cited approvingly in the final report to set the parameters of the legal situation of NI and what the contents of a specific solution should entail **\[E2b, p44\]**. 

 Our evidence to the House of Lords EU Committee inquiry into ‘Brexit: devolution’ cited in its final report drew on PId’s evidence emphasising the need to avoid a physical land border as a focal for potential violence and history of EU funding in the border region in maintaining peace. The report quotes our evidence directly that ‘that the burden of Brexit would ‘fall most heavily on Northern Ireland, because of its unique historical, political and geographical situations’. In their \[our\] view, it would not be possible after Brexit to maintain the open border as it exists at present in terms of goods. They feared that the return of physical manifestations of the border would act as a lightning rod to dissident republicans’ **\[E2c p19\]** The Withdrawal Agreement and the Northern/Ireland Protocol follow these recommendations. 

 PId’s submitted evidence to the Irish Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the GFA, which repeatedly cited the Policy Paper in its final report to shape its account of how Brexit would affect the GFA’s arrangements **\[E3, pp.112\-117 fen 84,92,93\]**. 

 PId briefed Margaret Ritchie, \(MP, between 2010 and 2017, former SDLP leader, member of the House of Lords\), including meetings and emails. In a testimonial letter **\[E4\]** Ritchie states: 

 ‘In early 2017 following an in\-person briefing from the group and email correspondence regarding draft parliamentary questions, I questioned the Government on potential human rights reform occurring alongside the Withdrawal negotiations. In response the Government acknowledged it would not pursue human rights reform during Brexit and would likely be obliged to accept human rights obligations in establishing the future UK/EU relationship. This was an important early response from the UK Government \[…\] which ultimately led to protections being embedded in Article 2 of the Protocol to the Withdrawal agreement.’ 

####  Joint Committee of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission – GFA Human Rights Oversight Body 

 Our proven expertise and track record led to our successful tender to complete our first Report on Brexit and Human Rights for the Joint Committee and from here our subsequent Reports. The Report *Discussion Paper on Brexit* **\[R2\]**, which O’Donoghue and Warwick presented to the Committee in Dublin, was the basis for the Joint Committee’s lobbying of both Governments to sustain cross\-border human rights protections. Our Report demonstrated the extent to which Brexit could result in diminution of rights as well as multiple categories of rights holders living side by side in NI, which would negatively impact on the peace process. Published March 2018, the Report received extensive media coverage **\[E5a\]**, including Joint Chairs of the Committee citing our Paper in media interviews and formed the basis of the Joint Committee’s dealings with the UK and Irish Governments and EU on Brexit \(including advancing the findings presented in this paper in a meeting with Michel Barnier\): 

 ‘This research has been vital ... for balancing a public narrative that all too often focuses on trade… The Commission was able to use this research to flag these issues in discussions with the UK Government and EU negotiating team, obliging the negotiators to spell out the choices that were being made in terms of rights protections’ <ins>\(Chief Commissioner Les</ins> <ins>Allamby</ins><ins>\)</ins> **\[E6\]**. ‘This research was central to the concerted efforts of both bodies in Northern Ireland and IHREC to shape public debate on the Withdrawal Agreement and redress a previous imbalance in the political and public narrative which was overwhelmingly focussed on trade’ <ins>\(Chief Commissioner Caroline Fennell\)</ins> **\[E6\]**. 

 Subsequently, PId was commissioned by the Joint Committee to author a *Discussion Paper on the Common Travel Area* **\[R4\]**. In preparation for the Report O’Donoghue and Warwick briefed Irish diplomats in London and O’Donoghue and Murray briefed civil servants at the Home Office on the limitations of the CTA. The Report was presented in November 2018 and immediately adopted is the basis for a major policy campaign by the Joint Committee to pressurise the UK and Irish Governments to clarify and further protect the reciprocal rights extended to each other’s’ citizens under the CTA. 

 The Report ‘…was the basis of the Commission’s engagement with the UK and Irish Governments over the Common Travel Area.’ The report generated front\-page headlines in the Irish Times and triggered a debate in Dáil Éireann. In the months after the report was published the UK and Irish Governments responded in light of its recommendations, concluding a new Memorandum of Understanding redefining the scope of the CTA and introducing specific legislation covering social security arrangements between the two governments <ins>\(Chief Commissioner Les</ins> <ins>Allamby</ins><ins>\)</ins> **\[E6\]**. 

 The CTA report received considerable media attention, including front\-page headlines in the *Irish Times* and *Irish World* \(interview with O’Donoghue\) and shaped public debate **\[E5b\]**. 

 PId’s call for enhanced legal protections was taken up by Fianna Fáil, the then opposition in Ireland, in parliamentary debate and was referenced as the basis of questioning the Minister of Employment Affairs in the Irish Dáil about certainty over maintaining reciprocal arrangements between Ireland and the UK **\[E7\]**. Since the Report’s publication it has shaped public debate and understanding of the CTA. The UK and Irish Governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding which delineates the CTA to rectify some of the shortcomings that the Report described as ‘written in sand’ in direct response to our Report’s finding and recommendations: ‘The work was vital to establishing the rights implications within Northern Ireland of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union. The fruits and proof of the success of this engagement is evident in the major role of the Commissions and the Joint Committee envisaged in Article 2 of the Withdrawal Agreement’s Protocol with regard to safeguarding rights’ <ins>\(Chief Commissioner Caroline</ins> <ins>Fennell\)</ins> <ins> **\[</ins><ins>E</ins><ins>6</ins><ins>\]**</ins>. 

 Our 2020 Report for the Joint Committee ‘Continuing EU Citizenship “Rights, Opportunities and Benefits” in Northern Ireland after Brexit’ has significantly impacted and shaped UK and Irish Government responses to citizenship rights across Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Britain. The cumulative impact of the Reports is that the Joint Committee now has a specific role in post\-Brexit human rights protection. 

 ‘\[B\]oth Commissions in Northern Ireland, and the Joint Committee of representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Northern Ireland and Ireland, will provide a dedicated monitoring mechanism to ensure the protection of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and the UK government’s commitment to no diminution of rights under the 1998 Agreement’ <ins>\(Chief Commissioner Caroline</ins> <ins>Fennell\)</ins> <ins> **\[</ins>E6\]**. 

 During UK Parliamentary debates on the *Immigration and Social Security Co\-ordination \(EU Withdrawal\) Bill* both CTA and EU Citizenship Reports were repeatedly relied upon by Parliamentarians to push the Government to confirm that their changes were in line with its recommendations and the EU Settlement Scheme was in accordance with the GFA. The UK Government responding to these debates, changed its advice to Irish citizens on registering for the EU Settled Status Scheme. Government minister, Baroness Williams of Trafford, in direct response to a Parliamentary question stated that registering under the system would enable Irish citizens to prove their status. 

 ‘I and other peers drew extensively upon the …Group’s Reports for the Joint Committee on Citizenship and the Common Travel Area to push the Government to confirm that their changes would be in line with its recommendations. The conclusions of these reports, in particular that the existing CTA arrangements are ‘written in sand’ were relied upon \[…\] the UK Government, in direct response to these interventions, changed its advice to Irish citizens regarding the EU Settled Status Scheme’ \(<ins>Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick\)</ins> **\[E4\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Shterin’s sociological research on minority religions, focused on Russia and East European states, has shaped new legal precedents for defence against inaccurate charges of extremism; created best\-practice guidelines for the provision of expert evidence; and influenced training of government and legal officials. His research showed that policy and judicial decisions relating to minority religions are often driven by political and media\-led framings rather than reliable evidence. In particular, anti\-extremism legislation is routinely used to ban and prosecute non\-violent religious groups. In collaboration with the educational charity Inform, Shterin has worked with legal professionals and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) to protect the human rights of members of minority religious groups in several post\-communist states, including Russia, Estonia and the Slovak Republic. His research has redirected Inform’s policy towards a new focus on extremism and radicalisation, reorienting its collaboration with the UK government and civil service. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Shterin’s sociological research on minority religions has: 

 1. Identified competing epistemologies in public understandings of minority religions and new religious movements and clarified how political bias and moral panic have prejudiced policy and judicial decisions in Russia. This research established the need for a research\-informed approach to judicial and government decision\-making in Russia and other post\-communist states. 

 2. Reframed and broadened academic approaches to the study of ‘extremism’ and ‘radicalisation’. This has demonstrated the need to replace normative psychological and ideological approaches with evidence\-based frameworks drawn from sociological research on minority religions. 

#  1. Identifying and assessing competing epistemologies in the public understanding of religious minorities 

 Between 2006 and 2009, Shterin’s sociological research, partly funded by the Academy of Finland, revealed considerable discrepancies between available research\-based evidence and public representations of religious minorities, in particular newer religious groups in Russia. Shterin demonstrated that political agendas, cultural assumptions and interests of particular groups were among the key factors accounting for these epistemological discrepancies. His research showed that policymaking, formation of public discourse and outcomes of litigation were dependent on how and why particular individuals and groups came to be seen as ‘experts’ on religious minorities. 

 Shterin elaborated these findings within the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\)\-funded collaborative project, Politics and Practice of Religious Diversity \(2014–16\), which conducted discourse analysis of political, legal and media representations, triangulated with ethnographic work in three Russian regions. This research demonstrated that Russia’s restrictive measures towards minority religions are the result of the competing interests of political elites, religious institutions with their hierarchies and minority religions themselves. In this environment, public representations of minority religions have significant influence in framing policy and legal decisions on minority religions. Shterin’s study concluded that mass media and state\-recognised ‘experts’ play a crucial role in the formation of legislative policy and judicial decisions in Russia \[1,2\]. 

 Shterin’s project Academic Expertise in ‘Anti\-Extremism’ Litigation Involving Minority Religions \(2017–current; partly funded by King’s Global Engagement Partnerships\) extended these research findings specifically in terms of the engagement of public and policy agents. Shterin analysed which ‘voices’ are sought as ‘expert opinion’ on religious minority groups by law courts, and how this opinion is used to validate legislative and judicial decisions. Deploying a pioneering, impact\-oriented engaged methodology, Shterin established direct collaboration with Russia’s human rights lawyers, NGOs and independent scholars, who were both participants in and beneficiaries of the research \[3\]. 

#  2. Reframing academic approaches to improve public understanding of religious minorities, extremism and ‘radicalisation’ 

 Shterin’s project Religiously Motivated Violence in the Contemporary World: Public Debates and Academic Research’ \(2006–07; partly funded by the British Academy\) systematically established interdisciplinary dialogue and generated empirical studies across the fields of Anthropology, Sociology and Religious Studies. This collaboration revealed systematic differences between academic, evidence\-based conclusions and public framings of the link between minority religions and religiously motivated violence. In particular, this project elaborated how concepts and methodologies developed in the study of new religious movements can be fruitfully applied to investigating the processes of ‘radicalisation’ and violence commonly attributed to radical Islamic groups \[4\]. 

 This research informed two further projects: a collaborative \(Shterin and Yarlykapov\) ethnographic study of the New Muslims Jamaat in the Northern Caucasus \(2009–2011\), followed by a sociological analysis of the idea of Caliphate among young Muslims, developed through a broad range of empirical cases from around the globe \(2012–13; partly funded by the European Research Council \(ERC\)\). Rather than narrowly focusing on the role of ideological persuasion, these two cutting\-edge studies showed that the appeal of ‘radical Islam’ for some young Muslims can only be explained by considering the interplay of socio\-demographic characteristics, political settings, religious motivations and societal reactions. These two projects contributed to reframing academic approaches to the study of ‘radicalisation’ and terrorism by demonstrating the importance of explanatory frames that are interactive, contextualised and focused on human agency \[5,6\]. 

 Shterin’s research findings on minority religions were disseminated to academics and policymakers in London at the Westminster Faith Debates \(2012\) and at the House of Commons \(2017\), and in continental Europe at the European Forum Alpbach \(Religion and Violence\) and Religion and \(In\)Equality seminars \(2010 and 2016\) and the European Summer School on Religion and Violence, funded by the European Parliament \(2015\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Shterin’s research has shaped legal practice and protected the human rights of members of minority religious groups in several post\-communist states, including Russia, Estonia and the Slovak Republic. In addition to his direct collaboration with Russian NGOs and lawyers, a privileged pathway for the dissemination and use of Shterin’s research has been the close collaboration with Inform \(Information Network Focus on Religious Movements\), a UK\-based educational charity that provides evidence\-based consultancy for civil servants and policymakers. Inform was chaired by Shterin from 2017 to 2019 in recognition of how his research\-based expertise was crucial to direct the strategy and activities of the charity. 

 Shterin’s research findings have been disseminated through the biannual Inform seminars, which bring together 70–100 academics, policymakers, lawyers and journalists from the UK, eastern Europe and beyond. For the purpose of illustrating Shterin’s research impact, this impact case study will focus on examples from post\-communist states: Russia, Estonia and the Slovak Republic, well known for their difficult relation with freedom of religions and human rights. 

 Shterin’s research has led to impact in four key areas: 

#  1. Establishing new legal precedents for defence against unwarranted charges of extremism 

 Shterin collaborated with Baltic Law, the largest legal practice in Russia, in a “landmark case in the use of anti\-extremist legislation against minority groups” \[F\]. Drawing on insights from Shterin’s research \[1,2,3\], the result of this collaboration was “the development of a sound, research\-based legal approach in the case of St Petersburg Prosecutor v. St Petersburg Scientology group” \[F\]. Meleshko highlights the significance of the research as pioneering “a significant step in establishing principles regarding legal evaluation of academic testimonies \[...\] with considerable ramifications for future litigation” \[F\]. 

 In the last decade, Shterin has worked closely with Russian attorney Dr Galina Krylova, who has “constantly used Shterin’s work in preparing defence strategy in a number of cases involving Jehovah’s Witnesses, Church of Scientology, and International Society for Krishna Consciousness” \[B\], tried both in Russia and at the European Court of Human Rights. Krylova highlights the deep ethical and political significance of such cases: “what is at stake in this litigation is the freedom of conscience and religion in the country as a whole” \[B\]. Most recently, in 2020, Shterin provided a 30,000\-word expert testimony, based on his research, that Krylova deemed “highly significant for law courts’ understanding of the difference between legally admissible research\-based evidence and politically motivated or ideologically biased allegations” \[B\]. Krylova found Shterin’s contribution “instrumental for preparing an important case \[...\] in the European Court of Human Rights.” She also testified to the wider reach of Shterin’s research: “my specialism in cases \[concerning minority religious movements\] is in high demand among Russian lawyers and through my legal consultancy Dr Shterin’s work \[...\] influences them” \[B\]. 

#  2. Creating best\-practice guidelines and informing policymaking 

 Between 2017 and 2019, Shterin led two workshops for Russian defence lawyers in St Petersburg, organised by two prominent NGOs: the Centre for Independent Social Research and the SOVA Center for Information and Analysis. These workshops led to the creation of a website outlining best\-practice guidelines for the provision of expert evidence in litigation involving minority religions \[see A\]. Alexander Verkhovsky, SOVA’s Director and a member of the presidential advisory board, regards this resource as “an essential guide in providing rigorous legal challenges to the implementation of the restrictive Russian Law on Combatting Extremism that contravenes International Human Rights conventions on religious freedom” \[A\]. Verhovsky confirms that Shterin’s research “helps us to focus our monitoring and analysis on specific lobbyists and government agencies that abuse anti\-extremist legislation in relation to minority religions” \[A\]. 

 Shterin’s research on religiously motivated violence and radicalism \[4,5,6\] has also been used in Estonia and the Slovak Republic. In 2019 Ringo Ringvee, Chair of the Committee for Religious Organisations at the Estonian Ministry of the Interior, participated in an Inform seminar at KCL. He cited his exchanges with Inform and Dr Shterin’s work as influencing the implementation of a more tolerant and evidence\-based policy towards religious minorities. Ringvee confirms that “Shterin’s research was instrumental in helping \[the\] Religious Affairs Department at the Estonian Ministry of Interior to develop evidence\-based and conceptually sound policies and has shaped communication strategies with religious groups” \[C\]. In Slovakia Pavol Kosnáč, the only approved expert on religious extremism at the Slovak Ministry of Justice, has applied Shterin’s research to form evidence\-based policies towards religious radicalism: “Dr. Shterin’s research about Muslim ‘extremists’ in the Northern Caucasus helped me to develop analytical framework and policy recommendations” \[D\]. Shterin’s analysis of extremism, disseminated through Inform’s networks, has influenced policy in the Slovak National Strategy for Countering Extremism and led directly to tasking Presidium of Police Corps of the Slovak Republic to “increase analytical capacities focused on collection, centralization, classification and evaluation of information in the field of combating extremism”; the authors of the National Strategy were “directly influenced by advice provided on the problematic divisions between religion and culture highlighted by Shterin’s research” \[D\]. 

#  3. Training government and legal officials 

 Inform has provided training for officials and experts in Estonia, Slovakia, Lithuania, Czechia and Poland through its internships and its biannual workshops hosted by King’s. Through Shterin’s collaborative work with Inform, his research on religious minorities has significantly influenced these training programmes. In Estonia, for example, Shterin’s analysis of competing epistemologies in the public understanding of religious minorities and his research reframing academic approaches to extremism and ‘radicalisation’ have shaped the methods and content of training courses provided within the Department for Religious Affairs. In 2014, Inform partnered with this government department to deliver a course on religious minorities and law enforcement at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences based on Shterin’s research findings. Ringo Ringvee testifies that “Dr Shterin’s and Inform’s input was essential in shaping the in\-house training course for the negotiators in the law enforcement” \[C\]. 

#  4. Shaping Inform’s policy and extending Inform’s expertise 

 As outlined above, Shterin’s work with Inform has created new networks to facilitate significant and far\-reaching change to policy and practice in Russia, Estonia and the Slovak Republic. Shterin’s research has also had a decisive impact within Inform itself. The charity was established in 1988 to provide information on new religious movements, or ‘cults’; Shterin’s work has influenced Inform to reorient its policy towards a focus on extremism and radicalisation. After the publication of Shterin’s *Dying for Faith: Religiously Motivated Violence in the Contemporary World* in 2009 \[3\], Inform “began to reposition its insights and research towards contemporary preoccupations with threats from groups with extremist ideologies. \[...\] We have applied the insights and approaches pioneered by Dr Shterin’s published work in these contexts to shape Inform’s approach in improving public understanding of religious minorities, particularly in policy and security contexts” \[E\]. 

 As a consequence of these changes led by Shterin’s research, Inform has provided significant new resources to UK government departments. These include commissioned reports and briefings on far right extremism, extremism on campus and free schools for the Department for Education, as well as reports commissioned by other government offices on potential security threats posed by religious minorities \[see E\]. Inform Director Suzanne Newcombe confirms that “None of these policy briefings would have occurred without Dr Shterin’s inspiration and research on repurposing the insight of new religions into the threats posed by extremist groups” \[E\]. Shterin ran seminars on religious extremism in Russia at the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2017 and 2018, and during his tenure as Chair of Inform \(2016–19\) the charity won a Building a Stronger Britain Together award from the Home Office.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Carriero’s research on monetary policy, term structure models and forecasting has led to the development of monetary policy tools that inform policy makers in the UK and France in an environment of low inflation and near zero interest rates, such as the one prevailing in advanced economies after the 2008 financial crisis and during the COVID\-19 pandemic. Research by Carriero has informed the operational practices of HM Treasury’s Debt Management Office \(DMO\) in the areas of macroeconomic forecasting and bond pricing in an environment with near zero interest rates and has been used by the Banque de France \(BDF\) to measure its monetary policy stance. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Carriero produced an influential body of research on macroeconomic forecasting \(\[3.3\], \[3.4\], \[3.5\], \[3.7\]\). The econometric methods developed in these papers allow a rigorous assessment of the uncertainty involved in alternative macroeconomic scenarios. Carriero’s major contribution consists in developing methods for the estimation of time\-varying vector autoregressions with large data sets. 

 In a related stream of research, Carriero established a link between the forecasting performance of vector autoregressions and term structure models \(\[3.1\], \[3.2\]\). Term structure models use economic theory to explain the relationship among interest rates at different maturities. 

 Conventional term structure models, however, became increasingly ineffective in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Central banks worldwide implemented expansionary monetary policies in an attempt to revive their economies, but this led to an unprecedented situation in which interest rates became so low that they arguably could not go any lower. The ability of central banks to cut interest rates further was constrained by the zero lower bound: if government bonds paid negative interest rates, investors could earn higher \(i.e. zero\) returns by holding cash instead. This also meant that the compensation for holding short\-term government bonds until maturity \(term premia\) became negative. Conventional interest rate and monetary policy models were inconsistent with such a situation, since they invariably assumed that interest rates can fluctuate freely. 

 In collaboration with researchers at the DMO \(Vangelista\) and the BDF \(Mouabbi, previously a PhD student at Queen Mary\), and based on his expertise in macroeconomic forecasting and term structure models, Carriero developed an innovative joint nominal\-real interest rate model with a zero lower bound \[3.6\]. 

 The first key innovation of \[3.6\] is that it incorporates the zero lower bound restriction in a model including both real and nominal interest rates simultaneously. This makes it possible to price government bonds of different maturities, regardless of whether they are indexed or not indexed to inflation, while ensuring absence of arbitrage \(i.e. making a profit without risk by exploiting a mis\-pricing of some assets\) and enforcing the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. 

 The second key innovation of the model presented in \[3.6\] is that it estimates a 'shadow interest rate'. This is the policy rate that would prevail in absence of the zero lower bound and it can go below zero, unlike the actual policy rate. Importantly, the shadow interest rate can be interpreted as a measure of a central bank’s monetary policy stance in periods in which the actual rate is at the zero lower bound.

#  4. Details of the impact

#  Informing the operational practices of the Debt Management Office in the area of macroeconomic forecasting in relation to its bond issuance strategy 

 The Debt Management Office \(DBO\) decides annually on how the Treasury will finance government spending through issuing bonds in accordance with the debt management objective as well as the debt management framework and wider policy considerations. To do this, the government assesses the costs and risks of issuing government bonds \(debt securities issued to finance government spending\) by maturity and type \(i.e. indexed to inflation or not\). This requires accurate forecast models to understand the risks, costs and benefits involved under the alternative financing scenarios and alternative macroeconomic developments. 

 The DMO approached Carriero to develop a model to produce forecasts of future macroeconomic developments and their effects on government bond yields and their levels of risk. The model developed by Carriero based on his body of research \[3.3\-3.5 & 3.7\] has been routinely used by the DMO over the period 2014\-2020. Crucially, this model allows for a proper evaluation of the uncertainty around the forecasts in the form of a fan chart that shows visually the likelihood of alternative future scenarios. 

 James Warren – a Senior Research Economist at the DMO – stated: 

 ‘The forecasts produced by this model were inputs for the portfolio simulation tool, which is used in providing advice and evidence in setting the next year’s financing remit. Charts B4 and B5 in the Debt Management Report were generated using inputs created from the VAR, specifically the distribution of the likely future paths for RPI \[Retail Price Index\]’ \[5.1\]. 

 For example, in the Debt Management Report 2019\-2020 the portfolio simulation tool projected debt service costs for the year 2023\-2024 at between GBP45\-60,000,000,000. This projection is based on \(among other inputs\) the forecasting VAR model developed by Carriero. The DMO produces and publishes such projections annually \[5.4\-5.6\]. 

 Further evidence of the use of the forecasting model is provided in the 2017 Office for Budget Responsibility’s Fiscal risks report \[5.7\]. Over the last year, the forecasting VAR model developed by Carriero has been expanded by the DMO to allow use of larger data sets. 

#  Informing the Debt Management Office’s bond pricing activity in an environment with near zero interest rates 

 Between 2014\-2020 the DMO has routinely estimated the joint nominal\-real interest rates model with a zero lower bound, developed in \[3.6\], to produce reliable and theoretically sound estimates of the term premia and inflation premia. The estimated term premia are typically displayed in chart B2 of the annual Debt Management Report \[5.4\-5.6\]. These estimates are then used to inform the choice of a particular issuance strategy – i.e. what kind of bonds to issue with what maturity dates. 

 The Senior Research Economist at DMO explains: 

 ‘This model is used in the evidence process for the annual  [Debt Management Report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/597297/debt_management_report_2017-18_web.pdf) \(chart B2\). This model is broadly used to provide an indication, through the term premia, to understand whether or not there is any evidence to favour any particular issuance strategy’ \[5.1\]. 

 For example, in the Debt Management Report 2019\-2020 \[5.6\], the model shows that term premia on medium and long\-term gilts have been negative since 2015, which indicates that conventional \(i.e. not indexed to inflation\) bonds are more cost\-effective than has historically been the case. The estimates of the inflation premia instead indicate that – assuming that the Retail Price Index \(RPI\) remains constant at 3% – index\-linked gilts could offer better value to the government than equivalent maturity conventional gilts, with savings ranging from GBP2,000,000 to GBP10,000,000 for every 1,000,000,000 of gilts reopened. However, most of these savings would be wiped out if the RPI index were to go above 3.5%. 

#  Influencing the Banque de France’s approach to measuring its monetary policy stance 

 The Banque de France \(BDF\) and other central banks typically measure their monetary policy stance \(whether the policy is tight, neutral or loose relative to their objectives\) on the basis of the central bank interest rate \(policy rate\). Since in the aftermath of the crisis the policy rate could not go below the zero lower bound, conventional monetary policy was no longer viable. Indeed, central banks worldwide resorted to alternative policy instruments such as Quantitative Easing and therefore the policy rate became much less informative. In such a low interest rates environment, a new measure of monetary policy stance was needed. 

 The joint nominal\-real interest rates model with a zero lower bound, developed in \[3.6\], provides a no\-arbitrage measure of the shadow interest rate that can be reliably used by a central bank to evaluate its monetary policy stance. For this reason, it has been used by the BDF since 2015. 

 The Head of the Financial Economics Research Division at the Banque De France stated: 

 ‘This framework served as a basis for building a shadow\-rate model for European Overnight Index Swap interest rates at the Banque de France. The model allows the estimation of a synthetic measure, known as the shadow interest rate, which can be used as a proxy of the monetary policy stance in the euro area. 

 The euro\-area shadow rate estimate is currently updated every month and is part of the tools that are used to brief the Governor of the Banque de France, in preparation of the Governing Council at the European Central Bank’ \[5.2\]. 

 The BDF has used Carriero’s research \[3.6\] to measure its monetary policy stance, as reflected in the policy notes of the various departments of the Banque de France \[5.8\], \[5.9\], \[5.10\]. The policy note \[5.10\] in particular states that the model is 'used to build a shadow\-rate model for French zero\-coupon government bonds'. 

 In summary, by providing advanced technical tools for macroeconomic forecasting and interest rates modelling, particularly in near zero rate environments, Carriero’s research has supported and informed the decision\-making process of monetary policy institutions in the UK and France.

Research into designing macroprudential policies and new tools for monetary policy so as to make financial markets more resilient to crises and to improve regulation in the banking sector feature prominently. Many policies and tools for financial market management and monetary policy that were developed by researchers at UK universities have been implemented by the bank of England, the European Central Bank and other key monetary policy institutions around the world. Research into the functioning of financial and currency markets and the management of portfolios, often offering predictive tools, has also been adopted in the decision-making processes of monetary policy institutions as well as of global asset management firms, pension funds and financial market participants.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

###  Research led by Edinburgh Napier University \(ENU\) identified the temporal drivers of mass\-mating of harvested Brazilian mangrove crabs and generated a mating forecast tool. The ENU\-made forecasts, informed by multiannual ENU\-led fieldwork, were implemented by the Brazilian government into national crab fisheries legislation 2020 to 2024, for 96% \(1,344,526 ha\) of Brazil’s mangrove area, affecting 11 federal states and 222 councils, including 76 sustainable use protected areas. 

###  The new science\-based crab mating forecasts replaced the former precautionary method \(used by the government since 2003 for setting annual crab capture bans and which regularly had a 50% failure rate\) with biologically meaningful and societally beneficial ones.Avoidance of the unnecessary bans resulted in:\(a\) increased environmental law compliance\(b\) a 50% reduction in government spending on capture ban policing in 2020\(c\) a 50% reduction in income losses in 2020, as compared to the former governmental policy This impacted on \(conservative estimates\):\(i.\) an estimated 51,635 crab fishers, sustaining approximately 283,990 household members\(ii.\) over 600 crab traders *and* \(iii.\) over 1,000 restaurant owners selling crab dishes \(incl. beach huts\)

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Mangrove ecosystems provide vital services at local, national and global scales, including habitat for exploitable species such as the crab *Ucides cordatus*. In Brazil, these mangrove crabs are of high cultural, socio\-economic and ecological significance **\[O1, O2\].** Tens of thousands of crab fishers, typically without alternative income options, depend on the *Ucides* crabs. The sustainability of this crab fishery is therefore of societal concern. There are no signs or projections of collapsing stocks, but the crabs are long\-lived and grow very slowly which has led the government to implement a suite of fishing rules. However, government regulators have lost their credibility among crab fishers, due to a mismatch between precautionary capture bans implemented annually since 2003 \- to protect the crabs during their conspicuous mass\-mating events \- and the actual occurrence of such mating events. Fishers adhering to the bans miss out on crucial income; consequently 'wrong' bans have sparked conflict and environmental law incompliance. To solve this conflict, Professor Karen Diele, at ENU since February 2012, with Brazilian colleague Dr Anders Schmidt \(former PhD student and postdoctoral research assistant, now Lecturer at the Universidade Federal do Sul da Bahia\) designed and conducted novel research between 2006 and 2020 **\[O3,O4\]**, which was instrumental for the successful development of a new fisheries management tool used to inform the Brazilian government. 

 The multi\-annual research designed and conducted by Diele and Schmidt evidenced that the occurrence of mass\-mating is linked with geophysical cycles **\[O3,O4\].** The crabs' mating can therefore be predicted in time, and over a large spatial scale. 

 Diele and Schmidt first observed this link for a crab population in the north\-eastern state of Bahia, and in 2012 identified what they named the Syzygy Tide Inequality Cycle \(STIC\) as the driver of the temporal pattern of the mass\-mating **\[O3\]**. STIC is a superposition of the neap\-spring cycle with the anomalistic cycle. The latter describes the differing distances of the moon relative to earth while it moves along its elliptical orbit. The point of the orbit closest to earth is called perigee. Whether mass\-mating \(and subsequent larval release a month later\) occurs at full or at new moon largely depends on which of the two moons is closer to earth in a given reproductive season, likely to the stronger gravitational pull and consequential larger tidal amplitudes **\[O3,O4\]**. In *Ucides*, peak larval release typically takes place at the onset of strong perigee ebb tides when the offspring are quickly exported from the inner estuary to coastal waters. 

 To scale\-up from the Bahia study site, in 2013 Diele and Schmidt founded the informal researcher network REMAR during Schmidt's six\-month PDRA stay at ENU, funded by the Brazilian ‘Science Without Borders Program’. REMAR unites researchers from ENU \(Diele\), nine Brazilian Universities and research institutions. Between 2014 and 2020 REMAR researchers have recorded mass\-mating events at up to nine sites along the 7,500 km of the Brazilian coast, from north to south, including macro\-, meso\- and microtidal regimes. A best\-practice fieldwork protocol was used, developed by Diele, for standardized counting of crabs outside their burrows, despite disturbance \(a reliable indicator for mass\-mating events\) along five transects per site, at each new and full moon, during the crabs’ peak reproductive season. 

 The data collected at the REMAR sites were compiled and analysed by Diele for the Brazilian government **\[O4\]**. Informed by the multiannual field data **\[O3,O4\]**, Diele and Schmidt developed an algorithm including a component to account for the crabs’ anticipatory behaviour **\[O3\]** to robustly predict the moon phase of future mass\-mating events for macro\- and mesotidal North and North\-Eastern Brazil. The data generated through fieldwork conducted by REMAR are being complemented through citizen\-scientists entering observations of mass\-mating crabs into the purpose\-built smartphone application REMAR\_CIDADÃO **\[O4\]**.  The app, developed by Diele in collaboration with Schmidt and colleagues and students from ENU’s School of Computing, was launched in Brazil in November 2017.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\)Complementary REMAR research and outreach activities led by Diele and Schmidt have informed and significantly transformed awareness, behaviour and decision\-making of the main actors involved in the management of the Brazilian mangrove crab fishery. 

 Strategic engagement with a variety of stakeholders and the public increased confidence in REMAR’s newly developed method for predicting mass\-mating and ultimately facilitated the first major change in the government’s precautionary approach to fisheries management since 2003. 

 Forecasts of the likely lunar phase of future crab mass\-mating events \(which Diele provided to the government twice upon request\) have set the timing for capture bans during the main reproductive season of this important mangrove fisheries resource for 5 years, for 2020 and for 2021 to 2024, for 96% of Brazil’s mangroves and 4,870 km coastline. The legislation for 2020 halved public spending for policing bans and reduced income losses of approximately 337,225 dependants of the fishery, including socially and economically marginalized artisanal fishers and their families, traders and restaurant owners \(see beneficiaries section\). Similar benefits are expected to result from the 2021\-2024 legislation. 

 The path to policy change in mangrove crab fisheries management was spearheaded by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation \(ICMBio<sup>1</sup>\), the administrative branch of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment \(MMA<sup>2</sup>\). Between 2016 and 2019, Diele and Schmidt implemented strategic “demonstration years” in a sustainable use protected area at the Bahia\-state study site to inform the manager \(and fishers\) before each breeding season at what moon phase the crabs would mate. These forecast were 100% correct, much to the manager’s and local fishers’ surprise, as shown by this quote of an anonymous email: *“I want to know how you do to have such a favourable result in relation to the prediction \(of the mating\) of the species”* \(received by REMAR on 03/01/2018, translated from Portuguese\). 

 Due to the accuracy of the forecasts, the responsible Bahia ICMBio\-CEPENE<sup>3</sup> office \(National Centre for Research, Conservation and Marine Biodiversity in North\-East Brazil\) requested a stakeholder report from Diele and Schmidt, i.e. a summary of their research to that date with a stakeholder recommendation in laymen terms. The report **\[O4\]** supplemented a ‘Technical Note’ \(Nota técnica\) **\[C1\]** sent by the local ICMBio office to other national ICMBio offices in August 2019. As a result, in November 2019, Diele and Schmidt were invited to present at a conference run and attended by key national ICMBio employees. For example, Mr Leonardo Pacheco \(ICMBio\-DIBIO\) later discussed REMAR’s research and Diele and Schmidt’s stakeholder recommendation **\[O3,O4\]** in the capital with representatives of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Food Stock and Supply \(MAPA<sup>4</sup>\) and its affiliated Secretariat of Aquaculture and Fishery \(SAP<sup>5</sup>\). 

 In December 2019, SAP/MAPA, the branch responsible for fisheries legislation in Brazil, requested Diele’s advice on the definition of *Ucides cordatus* crab capture bans for the 2020 reproductive season, for North and Northeast Brazil **\[C2**\- **A\]**. Diele submitted forecasts of likely dates/moon phases of forthcoming mass\-mating events **\[C2**\- **B\]**, i.e. the times when capture of male crabs should be banned each month within the three months of peak reproductive activity \(as per law, females are protected throughout the entire three months\). 

 The Brazilian Navy and the National Observatory provided Diele with future tidal and moon phase data needed for the forecast calculations. 

 Diele’s policy advice for 2020 was formally implemented by SAP/MAPA through a legislative normative act **\[C2**\- **C&D\]**, marking the end of the 17 years of precautionary approach for crab fisheries management. The new normative act applied to 11 federal states and 222 councils, containing 96% of the country’s mangrove area, the obligate habitat of the harvested crabs. The capture bans specified in the act regulate: the capture, the meat processing industry, transportation, and commercialization of the crabs during their reproduction. 

 The success of the 2020 policy change was demonstrated by a questionnaire sent by ICMBio to 27 protected area managers, revealing a 95% match between Diele’s predicted moon phases of mass\-mating and the actual mating **\[C3**, page 10 **\]**. Due to the convincing results, in October 2020 SAP/MAPA requested new mass\-mating forecasts from Diele for the forthcoming next 4 years \(2021\-2024\) **\[C4**\- **A,B\]**, showing their trust in the forecasting method. 

 The 2021\-2024 normative act was published in December 2020, for the same states as that of 2020 **\[C4**\- **C,D\]**. A normative act for consecutive years is a novelty and significantly facilitates the planning of the executionary branches and productive chain of the crabs’ fishery \(see below\). 

 To help evaluate and improve the accuracy of the mass mating forecasts in future years, SAP/MAPA are advocating on their webpage the use of the REMAR\_CIDADÃO citizen science app to report mass\-mating events **\[C5\-A\]**; likewise, the app has been advertised on ICMBio webpages each year starting in 2018 **\[C5**\- **B,C\]**. Since its 2017 launch, the app has been downloaded over 1,000 times from Google Playstore/Brazil, from all 16 Brazilian coastal states with mangroves, and received a 4.9\* out of 5\* rating to date \(n = 28\) **\[C6\]**. It has encouraged university students to engage with fisheries management: *“Dear Dr. Karen Diele, it is with great satisfaction that I join the REMAR Cidadão program, via the mobile app, my name is …., I am graduate in Sciences and I am interested in working in the research area. …*” \(email received by REMAR 20/12/2017\) and the app was featured multiple times in Brazilian TV, radio, print and social media **\[C7\]**. 

 **BENEFICIARIES:** 

 **\(i.\) Decision\-Makers:** Engagement with the government \(i.e. SAP/MAPA and ICMBio\), through 6 presentations given by Diele \(in person or virtual\) was key for achieving knowledge transfer, behavioural change and, ultimately, policy change. For example, 100% \(n = 41\) of the attendees giving feed\-back after Diele’s presentation to SAP/MAPA employees on 24<sup>th</sup> September 2020 responded that they had gained new knowledge relevant to their work, and 85% said it would positively influence their actions in fisheries management **\[C8\]**. SAP/MAPA benefitted significantly through the implementation of Diele’s policy advice, as protected area managers and the fishing community gained confidence in their decision\-making. The accuracy of government measures is key to law compliance and sustainable fisheries, which has been cited as one of several positive effects of the amended legislation for 2020:  “ *…..,when a ban coincides with the mass mating events, everything makes more sense for the society and the protection measure becomes more effective’* **\[C3**, page 19 **\].** 

 **\(ii.\) Managers of Sustainable Use Protected Areas:** After 17 years of precautionary capture bans, 2020 was the first year that crab capture was only prohibited at <ins>one</ins> syzygy \(at full moon, due to the generally slightly higher tidal amplitudes in that year\) and not during new **and** full moon periods. In the feedback given to ICMBio by protected area managers on the changed policy, the following were identified as key positive effects of the new REMAR\-advised approach: *saved costs* \(see \(iv\) and **\[C8\]**\) *, the reduction of conflicts, a higher income for crab fishers* and *more effective planning and conservation* **\[C3**, page 18 **\]**. This shows that the step\-change in Brazil’s mangrove fishery management due to the policy change has been very well received by this important stakeholder group **\[C2**\- **D, C4\-D\].** 

 **iii.\) Crab fishers, traders and restaurant owners:** As a consequence of the reduction of biologically unnecessary capture bans in North and Northeast Brazil 2020 onwards, loss of income for actors in the production chain is reduced by up to 50% when compared to the former policy. This benefitted an estimated 51,635 socioeconomically disadvantaged crab fishers in the region **\[O1, O2\] \[C9**\- **A, B\],** and the approximately 283,990 household members they help sustain \(extrapolated from **\[O1\]** and **\[C9**\- **A, B\]**\). Continued supply\-chains instead of unjustified capture bans have also financially benefitted more than 600 crab traders **\[C9**\- **A, B\]** and over 1,000 restaurant owners in North and North\-eastern Brazil **\[C9**\- **C\]**. These two groups further benefit from the new anticipated legislation, which now covers 4 years: For example, any person wanting to transport or trade pre\-stocked crabs during capture ban periods must submit mandatory ’stock declarations’ to SAP in advance. In the past, ban dates were only published very shortly ahead of the bans, complicating this process. For the first two bans in 2021 more than 800 declaration forms have been submitted to SAP **\[C4\-E\]**. 

 **\(iv.\) Brazilian public and species conservation**: Policing for law compliance along the North and Northeast Brazilian coastline could be reduced by 50% in 2020 as a result of the new fisheries management approach. Extrapolating this to all protected areas with mangroves in the regions results in a cost reduction of up to BRL 2.23 million \(March 2021\) **\[C10\]**. The money saved through the new legislation 2020 to 2024 can be directed to other public needs, including investment into other measures to help conserve and sustainably use Brazil’s ecologically and economically important mangrove crabs. 

 **\(v.\) Holders of new research grants in Brazil:** While presenting REMAR’s research and achieved policy change for North/Northeast Brazil to ICMBio and University staff in southern Brasil in November 2020, I encouraged them to apply for grants to fill management\-relevant data gaps on mass\-mating of two species \(incl. *Ucides*\) in the microtidal South. As a result, one project, already approved by the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund \(FUNBIO<sup>6</sup>\), received BRL 1.19 million **\[C11\-A\]**, and a second one, in the process of being approved, has been classified for a further BRL 1.20 million of funding **\[C11\-B\].** ENU is a named partner in both projects.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A new framework for understanding current and future water demands in agriculture has directly informed policy and management reforms by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\) and the Environment Agency. 

 Cranfield research has been used across the agri\-food sector \- including horticultural and fresh produce retail businesses \- to develop sustainable water plans and build resilience. 

 Policy changes and industry engagement around planning and catchment management are critical to protecting fresh produce supply chains from climate change both domestically and globally; and meeting growing global demand for fresh fruit and vegetables \(with the associated benefits to public health\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cranfield staff developed a combination methodology to provide the first national\-scale assessment of water demands and the economic value of irrigated agriculture. This involved using hydrological and biophysical models to estimate water requirements for a range of crops, incorporating spatial variations in soils, land use, agronomic management practices and agro\-climate. More reliable estimates of water demand were produced by incorporating algorithms to eliminate distortions arising from weather variation and integrating high\-resolution geospatial data. Using horizon scanning techniques with input from stakeholder groups, scenarios were constructed to reflect plausible changes in future agro\-economic policy, environmental regulation and socio\-economic development. The combined impacts on future agricultural water demands were then modelled as part of a national initiative to provide robust and methodologically consistent demand forecasts across competing sectors \(public water supply, agriculture, power generation and environment\) \[R1\]. Our research has provided the evidence for all national strategic water demand forecasts for agriculture by Defra, the Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Natural Resources Wales over the last two decades. 

 Capitalising on high\-resolution climatology from the UK Climate Impacts Programme, the researchers had previously developed simulation models to integrate climate change into the modelling and mapping of impacts on crop yields, and the potential risks and opportunities that might arise from predicted changes in land suitability \[R2\]. For selected high\-value crops, experimental data were used to validate biophysical models to assess the impacts of climate variability and abiotic stress \(drought\) on productivity, water use and crop quality, under both conventional and precision management regimes \[R3\]. Econometric analyses assessed the impacts of water stress on price due to reductions in crop quality. By combining outputs, the researchers quantified the financial benefits of irrigation and economic consequences of restrictions on irrigation abstraction \[R4\]. In parallel, and drawing extensively on the outputs from this research, new methodologies were developed to conduct post farm\-gate assessments of water footprints, and to assess the impacts of dietary choices on water use and greenhouse gas emissions \[R5\]. 

 Cranfield led the agricultural drought impacts and modelling research \(within the Historic Droughts and MaRIUS projects\) and agricultural stakeholder engagement in the five\-year NERC Droughts and Water Scarcity Programme \(2015 to 2019\). Building on our earlier research, this critically evaluated farm\-scale strategies to improve drought resilience in agriculture under conditions of increasing water scarcity \[R6\]. Our expertise in modelling climate and drought risks has also been applied to support business level decision\-making. This has involved the development of a webtool to help farming enterprises understand emergent drought and abstraction risks. This tool has supported decision\-making for a range of business sectors on how future changes in abstraction licensing \(resource availability and licensed ‘headroom’\) might impact on their investment plans for new irrigation and water resources infrastructure.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cranfield has delivered research impact through close collaboration: with key government agencies and departments \(Defra, Environment Agency \(EA\), Natural England, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, National Resources Wales\); with the private sector and agricultural levy board \(AHDB\); non\-governmental collaborators \(National Farmers Union \(NFU\), UK Irrigation Association, Royal Horticultural Society\); retailers \(Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s\); and, environmental stakeholders \(Rivers Trusts, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and WWF\-UK\). 

 This level of engagement has ensured our research has directly informed strategic responses at national and regional levels by the agri\-food industry to profound water resources policy reforms. It has also supported industry initiatives to raise awareness of the future climate and water\-related risks facing their sector \[S1\]. 

 Our socio\-economic, policy and environmental impacts are evident within three key areas: 

1.  **Abstraction regulation and agricultural water resources planning** 

 <ins>Research has underpinned national \(Defra and EA\) water regulation and policy formulation, as well as water resource planning at catchment, regional and national levels.</ins> 

 “The EA have relied extensively on the research by Cranfield staff to support its national strategic planning of water resources” \(Senior Advisor, EA\) \[S2\] 

 <ins>This has included strategies such as “The Case for Change: current and future water availability” \(2013\) providing core evidence to underpin the UK Government's Water White Paper, and latest national water policy “Meeting our future water needs: a national framework for water resources” \(2020\) \[S2\]. Three strategically important areas of EA water resources regulation have been supported by our research, including \(a\) understanding future water demands and climate uncertainty in the agricultural and horticultural sectors, \(b\) supporting the UK Government national framework for water resources, and \(c\) supporting abstraction management reforms including licence renewal \[S2\].</ins> 

 Our modelling approaches and outputs have also been used in regional integrated water resources management planning frameworks to support robust decision\-making, and in multi\-sector collaboration among stakeholders involved with public water supply, agriculture, power generation and the environment \[S3\]. 

1.  **Retailer water risks and sustaining sourcing** 

 Our work on water accounting, footprinting and water risk mapping has been used by 12 food and drink businesses \(including importers, manufacturers, and retailers\) to support company policies for more sustainable production and sourcing, and in support of sustainability reporting and supply chain engagement \(contributing to reduced water risks and environmental impacts\) \[S4\]. 

 “As a result of the work that Cranfield have delivered, we have been able to share best practice and learnings with our growers globally. The work on potatoes has been of particular benefit….to optimise marketable yield, ultimately making them more efficient and sustainable” \(Category Technical Manager, Sainsbury’s Plc\) \[S4\]. 

 An Agricultural Water Use Efficiency Toolkit, a bespoke package of training materials was developed by Cranfield for PepsiCo. The Toolkit is now being used to improve on\-farm water management and build resilience to climate and water risks right across its global operations, including the USA, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, China, and Australia. The core content is being used to deliver water use efficiency, improve resilience, create quality, and cost benefits, and improve farming livelihoods. The direct agricultural supply chain involved sources 25 crops across 60 countries and supports more than 100,000 jobs \[S5\]. 

 “\(Cranfield are\) critical partners in PepsiCo’s efforts to build a more resilient and sustainable agricultural supply chain, including a program of ongoing engagement.” <ins>\(Senior Director, PepsiCo Global Sustainability\) \[S5\].</ins> 

1.  **Improving drought risk management and climate adaptation** 

  

 The D\-Risk webtool has been actively promoted by the UK Irrigation Association in its Irrigation Handbook. There are more than 175 business users of D\-Risk, including major agribusinesses and high\-profile sports and amenity businesses, who use the tool to support their decision\-making, risk management and strategies regarding investment in new water infrastructure. Our risk\-based assessments have formed the basis of expert advice to the regulatory agencies \(Environment Agency, Natural England\) and agri\-food industry \(NFU, AHDB\) on the likely impacts of future climate and policy reforms on high\-value commodity agriculture \[S1\]. 

 Through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\), Cranfield researchers have been supporting Royal Horticultural Society \(RHS\) initiatives to improve water management across its own estates as well as members’ gardens in order to increase recognition of the value of water. This has been achieved by co\-provision of water management training to curatorial staff within the gardens; the press office delivering messaging on water management to 500,000 members and a national audience of gardeners; co\-production of an RHS Water Policy for the RHS Senior Leadership Team; selection of ‘water’ as a Theme for the RHS flagship shows at Chelsea and Hampton Court in 2021, and the re\-organisation and updating of the water management pages on its website. Cranfield provided improved information within their ‘water use in gardens’ and ‘watering’ advice profiles, which saw a 680% increase in web traffic in 2020 \(versus 2018\), impacting on new membership conversions \[S6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Gender Budgeting is the analysis of public resource allocation and revenue raising from a gender perspective. Gender budgeting activates gender mainstreaming by bringing together policy and resource decision making \(O’Hagan, \[C10\]\). Since 2000, researchers at GCU have produced research on the adoption and implementation of gender and equalities budget analysis. From an initial focus on the Scottish Government as an early pioneer among devolved governments, this research has directly impacted on the Equality Budget Statement \(EBS\), budgetary processes in Scotland, recommendations by international bodies and at sub/national level across the UK and beyond, and on civil society advocacy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Gender budgeting research and policy analysis began at GCU in 2000, enhancing international policy transfer and learning in the newly formed government institutions in Scotland. Early academic research and pressure from civil society resulted in the introduction of the Equality Budgets Advisory Group \(EBAG\) and the UK’s first ‘Equality Budget Statement’ in 2009. O’Hagan’s initial research of these institutional arrangements alongside the Scottish budget process and comparative analysis of other sub\-national governments \(Basque Country and Andalucía\) produced an institutional “Framework of Favourable Conditions” \(FFC\) for the adoption and implementation of gender budgeting.\[R1\] O’Hagan’s findings from interviews with officials, politicians, civil society activists, process tracing and documentary analysis of the budget processes and parliamentary engagement \(2000\-2010\) in the three territories were analysed from a feminist institutionalist perspective. The FFC has been further explored as a diagnostic of current practice \[R2\] and its application in distinct governmental contexts has been reviewed and refined \[C4\-C10\]. 

 O’Hagan’s gendered policy analysis and application of feminist economics within budget processes informed the documentary analysis of social security proposals \[R3\], highlighting implications for the new Social Security powers for Scotland and further implications for gender assessment of fiscal policy. 

 The research processes and findings – disseminated through multiple policy channels including parliamentary committees and membership of EBAG – mutually reinforced the research and its impact via O’Hagan’s role as an academic activist involved in the policy process. This has given her a unique vantage position to conduct feminist analyses of policy developments in Scotland. The research \[R1, R2\] led to O’Hagan’s appointment to the Commission on Local Tax Reform \(2015\) and Budget Review Group \(2016\-2017\), and \[R3\] on social security led to O’Hagan’s appointment on the Expert Advisory Group on Disability and Carers’ Benefits providing advice and guidance to government and the Social Security Agency for the first round of devolved benefits \(2017\-2021\) following the Social Security \(Scotland\) Act 2016. 

 Consistent with principles of community engagement and co\-production of policy, all research outputs have also been disseminated in more accessible formats such as on\-line blogs and reflection pieces \(Wales Centre for Public Policy\), and on\-line videos and training animations \(Health and Social Care Academy, Scotland, and Marginal Eyes by Engender Scotland\). Extending equalities analysis into the evaluation of Participatory Budgeting \(PB\) in Scotland 2016\-2018 applied a wider equalities lens to participatory governance in practice. Commissioned by the Scottish Government, O’Hagan led a three\-year evaluation project comprising participatory action research, multiple observations of PB events and focus groups in 6 case study areas and 60\+ interviews with officials, community members, and politicians across Scotland. Proposing a new typology for formulating and evaluating PB activities, O’Hagan et al.’s 3Ts of ‘Transaction, Transference, and Transformation’ recommended alternative approaches for PB to incorporate equalities analysis and outcomes. \[R4, R5\] 

 As section 4 makes clear, O’Hagan’s research has contributed to changes in equalities monitoring and equality impact assessment. In recognition of her work on equality analysis in public finance, O’Hagan was awarded the Political Studies Association Jo Cox Award for Active Citizenship and Public Service 2019.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 O’Hagan’s research has secured policy impact within Scotland, amplified through pressure from civil society groups \(including Scottish Women’s Budget Group \[SWBG\] of which O’Hagan was Convenor from 2006\-2018\) to adopt feminist approaches to policy analysis in budgeting processes. 

 Equalities budgeting impacts from O’Hagan’s research and her position as a policy insider manifest in three inter\-related ways: 

 <ins>\(</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>Re\-conceptualising economic and fiscal issues \[R1, R2, R3\]</ins> 

 Feminist economics and policy analysis underpin gender budgeting, operationalising gender analysis at all stages of the policy process. The inception of the Scottish Parliament \(1999\) and the Beijing Platform for Action \(1995\) which included the global direction to include gender analysis in government budget processes \[R1\] were the impetus for civil society action in Scotland through the SWBG \[R1, C1, C2\]. International comparisons and analysis of the Scottish budget process led directly to the creation in 2009 of the Equality Budget Statement \[C1\]. Its iterations have been directly informed by \[R1, R2, C1, C2\] and O’Hagan’s sustained interventions as a member of the Equality Budgets Advisory Group \(EBAG\) and since 2018 as independent Chair. The revised budget process includes recommendations from O’Hagan’s membership of the Budget Review Group \[C2\] whose “influence meant that the scrutiny of equality issues was a core consideration” \(Group member, former Auditor General\), acknowledged by the Finance and Constitution Committee as having “directly contributed to recommendations that were accepted by the Scottish Government.” 

 <ins>\(ii\)</ins> <ins>Informing policy analysis, debates and discourse \[R1\-R5\]</ins> 

 International interest and impact \[see C4, C10\], \[C4\] and the Pan Islands Conference \(2017\) organised by O’Hagan at GCU with civil society and government participants from UK and Ireland. O’Hagan’s Framework directly contributed to subsequent changes in budgetary processes in Wales \[C5\], Ireland \[R2, C4\], Scotland \[C2\] and internationally as attested in the WBG Casebook \[C9\] and the creation of a 2020 toolkit on gender budgeting in European Structural Funds for the European Institute for Gender Equality \(EIGE\) \[C6, C7\]. O’Hagan’s framework has been applied to budget process reviews in Wales \[C4, C5\], Barcelona, the Basque Country, Andalucía, Iceland, and Ireland \[C3, C6\-10\]. The framework also structured civil society approaches to budget scrutiny in Spain, where the Platform for Gender Impact Assessment Now\! applied “learning from O’Hagan’s research to create the campaigning platform of feminist organisations in 2008, and the later practical application by various feminist organisations in Spain of her research on gender budgeting in Spain, UK and Europe.” \[R1\] 

 “Gender budgeting has been an area of strategic importance for CIPFA. \[O’Hagan\] was identified as one of the UK experts and was the author for a formal CIPFA briefing document which remains CIPFA’s formal commentary in this important area.” \(Chartered Institute of Public Finance Accounting \(CIPFA\), Director\). 

 <ins>\(iii\)</ins> <ins>Directly influencing policy and practice by governments and civil society organisations \[R2, R4, R6\]</ins> 

 O’Hagan’s framework \[R1\] was applied \[C4\] leading to the revision of gender budgeting in the Welsh Government, implementing the specific recommendations from \[C5\] the Gender Equality Roadmap, and pilots in discrete policy areas commencing in the 2019\-2020 budget period. 

 UK Women’s Budget Group confirmed O’Hagan’s contribution \[C9\] as “significant and valuable” in changing policy gender responsive budgeting through the 2018 Casebook, used as the basis for training and workshop sessions with officials and civil society representatives in Australia, Columbia, France, Morocco, New Zealand, Turkey and Vietnam. Changes secured in government policy based on O’Hagan’s research are echoed by institutional and civil society stakeholders. 

 The NI Women’s Budget Group reported that, “O’Hagan’s work has brought ‘gender responsive budgeting’ to the fore in the wider gender equality policy agenda. This has led to ongoing discussions with the Department for Communities, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the Department of Finance and Belfast City Council.” \[C11\] 

 A Scottish Government official attributed policy change in participatory budgeting guidance and the application of the 3T’s model in the strategic approach to PB following the recommendations from \[R4\] and subsequent outputs \[R5\]: “Findings helped inform Scottish Government policy development…how to focus spending for the national support programme in 2018/19 to embed PB in an inclusive and transparent way. The final report’s proposed 3Ts approach and implications for practice will inform the work plan for a national PB programme board to be established in Spring/Summer 2020.” \[C12\] 

 The CEO of the Glasgow Disability Alliance described PB evaluation research \[R5\] led by O’Hagan as powerful, adding that “The Evaluation Report outlines new possibilities by shifting the balance of decisions through transferring resources to local communities. Laying out the transformative potential of PB, the Report suggests a possible world of radical change and new relationships and power dynamics between citizens and local authorities.”

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Rob Maunder and his team at the University of Southampton have developed methodologies for the joint design of signal processing algorithms and their hardware acceleration for mobile communication. Since March 2016, the impact of this research has been as follows: 

 **I1** Creation of a spin\-out company AccelerComm Ltd to develop the research into commercial\-grade hardware accelerator designs. AccelerComm now employs 33 people, has a valuation of over \[text removed for publication\] and offers 27 hardware accelerator design products protected by 5 granted patents and a further 32 patent applications. 

 **I2** Deployment of hardware accelerator designs in 5G base\-stations, test\-and\-measurement equipment, satellites and user devices world\-wide, through 58 licenses of the AccelerComm products to \[text removed for publication\] organisations including National Instruments, \[text removed for publication\], generating \[text removed for publication\] of license sales booking for AccelerComm, plus royalty commitments that will be realised in future years. 

 **I3** Contributing to the global standards that define 5G. Maunder led a consortium including Ericsson, LG Electronics, Orange, NEC and Sony that contributed to defining the hardware accelerated signal processing aspects of the global standard for 5G mobile communication. 

 **I4** Facilitating 5G deployment. Research has led to open source simulation models that, in combination with AccelerComm's partnerships with hardware vendors Intel, Xilinx and Achronix, have contributed to the development of a global eco\-system for open standardised hardware platforms for 5G base\-station implementation, enabling the 'integration in a day' of hardware accelerators. 

 **I5** Maunder informed part of the UK government's Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review, which sets the flagship policy for the roll\-out of 5G in the UK, with the target of providing 5G coverage to the majority of the UK population by 2027.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 All deployments of state\-of\-the\-art 5G mobile communications around the world depend on complex signal processing, which enables communication with high throughput \(e.g. 20 Gbit/s\), as well as high energy\-efficiency, high spectral efficiency and hence high cost efficiency. In base\-stations and mobile devices, this signal processing must be hardware accelerated, so that the processing throughput can keep pace with the communication throughput. Conventionally, this hardware acceleration is designed separately from the signal processing algorithms. However, achieving the required processing throughput can result in a poor signal\-processing energy\-efficiency and/or a high hardware cost, which overshadows the targeted high communication energy\- and cost\-efficiency, diminishing the environmental and economic advantages of 5G. Since August 2013, Professor Rob Maunder's research at the University of Southampton has developed methodologies for the joint design of signal processing algorithms and their hardware acceleration. In this way, the throughput, energy\-efficiency and cost\-efficiency of both the transmission and the processing can be jointly optimised. 

 Funded by an EPSRC project \[ **G1**\], Maunder built a research team to apply the above\-mentioned research approach to error correction in mobile communications. This team has included five post\-doctoral researchers and ten PhD students, who have co\-authored 23 papers published in high impact IEEE and IET journals, which demonstrate the benefits of this methodology. For example, the application in turbo error correction codes demonstrated an order\-of\-magnitude improvement to processing throughput and latency, compared to the previous world record \[ **3.1**\]. The Intellectual Property \(IP\) arising from this research led to the team forming the spin\-out company, AccelerComm Ltd, in March 2016, as detailed in impact \[ **I1**\] below. 

 In addition to the research described above, AccelerComm's customer engagements of impact \[ **I2**\] has also originated from a combination of research activities undertaken by members of the team. For example, \[ **3.2**\] and \[ **3.3**\] achieved the greatest degree of flexibility to support diverse standards, requirements and settings ever demonstrated for the hardware acceleration of turbo and Low Density Parity Check \(LDPC\) error correction codes, respectively. Meanwhile, EPSRC funded research \[ **G2**\] led by Prof Lie\-Liang Yang proposed a framework for combining all Non\-Orthogonal Multiple Access \(NOMA\) mobile communication techniques into a single unified and generalised scheme for the first time \[ **3.4**\]. This expertise has been transferred to AccelerComm through GBP127,000 of Knowledge Transfer Partnership funding \[ **G3**\] and AccelerComm\-funded collaborations, which has led to the development of hardware accelerator design products, as detailed in impact \[ **I2**\] below. 

 Likewise, the team's research has also led to impacts in 5G standards \[ **I3**\], deployment \[ **I4**\] and government advice \[ **I5**\]. For example, in collaboration with \[text removed for publication\], Dr Peter Hailes characterised the fundamental trade\-offs between the various performance characteristics of hardware accelerated LDPC error correction codes, for the first time in \[ **3.3**\] and \[ **3.5**\]. This research influenced both \[text removed for publication\]'s and AccelerComm's contributions to the 5G standards, as well as to the development of open\-source models of those standards, as detailed below. Furthermore, \[ **3.6**\] demonstrated the first hardware accelerated turbo error correction codes that achieve the requirements of Ultra\-Reliable Low Latency Communication \(URLLC\). This expertise has been transferred to AccelerComm through an Innovate UK project \[ **G4**\] on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, which has subsequently informed government policy, as detailed below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **I1. AccelerComm Ltd:** The underpinning research \(particularly \[ **3.1**, **3.6**\] and the corresponding Hardware Description Language \(HDL\) source code\) led to the two patent applications on the hardware acceleration of channel decoding \[ **5.1**\]. With the assistance of the University of Southampton incubator Future Worlds, Maunder and Dr Taihai Chen developed a pitch for this IP and was awarded GBP50,000 of SETsquared Innovation to Commercialisation of University Research \(ICURe\) funding in October 2015. This enabled them to meet and interview over 100 potential licensee companies and discuss their requirements from which they developed a business plan. They made a successful application for Innovate UK Aid for Startups funding **G5** and incorporated AccelerComm Ltd in March 2016 \[ **5.2**\] to which the IP was assigned. They raised GBP500,000 of seed funding from IP Group \[ **5.3**\] in December 2016 and recruited four of the postdoctoral researchers and students from Maunder's research team into full\-time engineering positions. The ongoing collaboration between AccelerComm and the University of Southampton has resulted in a further 35 patent applications across Europe, USA and China, with five granted so far. Since the initial seed funding, AccelerComm has attracted a further GBP2,500,000 of investment from IP Group and Bloc Ventures in December 2018, as well as a further GBP5,800,000 of investment from IP Group, Bloc Ventures and IQ Capital in September 2020, with the company now valued at over \[text removed for publication\] \[ **5.3**\]. AccelerComm now employs 33 individuals in Southampton and has a sales office in the USA allowing it to address the world’s largest market for mobile communications. Dr Tom Cronk \(former management board member at Arm Ltd\) joined the company as full\-time CEO in May 2017 and Maunder has been employed as CTO for 4 days per week since April 2018. AccelerComm now offers a diverse range of 27 IP products, across the encoders and decoders of turbo, polar and LDPC channel coding, for application in base\-station and mobile devices, and with implementation in software, FPGA and ASIC \[ **5.4**\]. In recognition of its progress, AccelerComm has been selected in the EE Times Silicon 100 list of emerging electronics and semiconductor startups to watch \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **I2. Licensing and product innovation:** In addition to royalty commitments that will be realised in future years, AccelerComm has generated \[text removed for publication\] of license sales bookings, comprising \[text removed for publication\], demonstrating exponential growth. This has been achieved through 58 licenses of IP products to \[text removed for publication\], including several household name companies \[ **5.4**\]. This has generated business performance impacts for these customers through the introduction of new products and testing processes, including the following highlights: 

-  In January 2018, AccelerComm sold an IP research license to one of the world's leading smart phone manufacturers. This partner confirmed that the AccelerComm polar decoding ASIC IP offers a significantly superior hardware efficiency than their own research solution \[ **5.4**\]. Based on information published publicly by this partner, AccelerComm estimates that a 40% improvement in hardware and energy efficiency was found. This partner subsequently adopted this result as a benchmark for their productised solution, which has been now been deployed in their first 5G smartphones launched in 2019 and sold around the world. 

-  In February 2018, the FPGA manufacturer, Achronix announced a partnership with AccelerComm to apply the IP in their products enabling them to address new opportunities with 5G base\-station equipment manufacturers. “The ability to instantiate AccelerComm’s industry\-leading Polar Code IP in our eFPGA allows Speedcore\-enabled ASIC and SoCs to be updated to support new standards. We see that the ability to flexibly reprogram a hardware accelerator for new requirements and emerging standards is going to be fundamental for cost\-effective 5G deployments.” \(Mark Fitton, Achronix senior director \[ **5.6**\]\). 

-  In June 2018, AccelerComm sold an IP commercial license to National Instruments \(NI\) for FPGA firmware. NI Director of Marketing, RF and Communications, James Kimery stated “Our work with AccelerComm extends our platform toward 5G NR \[3GPP New Radio\] compliance which will enable researchers to build on 5G NR to explore application spaces critical to the 5G ecosystem” \[ **5.7**\]. NI have integrated AccelerComm's 5G polar encoding and decoding IP with other FPGA firmware and software, in order to implement their \[text removed for publication\] product \[ **5.7**\], exposing AccelerComm's 5G IP to NI's 35,000 customers world\-wide. For example, NI's lead customer for this product, Spirent, have launched 5G test equipment incorporating the AccelerComm IP \[ **5.7**\]. 

-  In March 2019, AccelerComm sold an IP research license to one of the leading Mobile Network Operators in the USA. This customer is using this IP for FPGA polar coding to implement a test platform for the roll\-out of their 5G network \[ **5.4**\]. This is enabling them to evaluate and compare the performance of commercial base\-stations offered by the leading equipment vendors, as well as supporting their contributions to the O\-RAN standard of \[ **I3**\]. 

-  In October 2019, AccelerComm partnered with Xilinx, the world's leading FPGA manufacturer to develop software and FPGA IP to enable 5G error correction on the Xilinx T1 FPGA board, using the BBDEV standard discussed in \[ **I3**\]. “AccelerComm’s channel coding IP is an important addition to the \[Xilinx T1\] Zynq UltraScale\+ RFSoC portfolio. This collaboration will help network equipment manufacturers get to market faster and deliver all\-important latency and power consumption improvements in 5G networks” said Dan Mansur, vice president of marketing, Wired & Wireless Group, Xilinx \[ **5.8**\]. AccelerComm is currently integrating this solution into the base\-station equipment of a \[text removed for publication\] manufacturer. 

-  In October 2019, \[text removed for publication\] it was found that the AccelerComm software LDPC error correction IP is up to 3 times faster than the equivalent Intel IP for this purpose \[text removed for publication\] in the Intel FlexRAN software\-defined basestation solution. By adopting AccelerComm's IP, Intel have been able to reduce the number of CPUs required to deploy FlexRAN \[text removed for publication\]. This reduces the costs of running a FlexRAN base\-station \[text removed for publication\] as well as the environmental impact. Intel is now supplying and marketing the AccelerComm IP to its customers worldwide \[ **5.9**\]. “Companies like AccelerComm who are using \[Intel’s FlexRAN reference software\] are creating new paths to quickly commercializing solutions for various types of RAN deployments”, said Cristina Rodriguez, VP and GM of Intel’s Wireless Access Network Division \[ **5.9**\]. 

-  In January 2020, AccelerComm sold an IP commercial license to \[text removed for publication\] 5G base\-station manufacturer. By integrating AccelerComm LDPC FPGA IP into its \[text removed for publication\] base\-station product, \[text removed for publication\] saved several person\-years of design effort and benefitted from improved system performance and reduced time to market, having now launched their product in \[text removed for publication\] international markets \[ **5.10**\]. 

-  In May 2020, AccelerComm sold an IP commercial license to a satellite company \[ **5.4**\]. This customer has adopted AccelerComm LDPC error correction IP for an ASIC, which they will deploy in \[text removed for publication\] satellites and in terrestrial equipment around the world. This customer could have adopted any proprietary error correction solution, but AccelerComm convinced them of the performance and standards compliance advantages of 5G LDPC coding. 

 **I3. Global 5G standards:** Global investment in implementing and deploying 5G has exceeded USD12bn so far and is expected to exceed USD800bn by 2025 \[ **5.11**\]. The standardisation of 5G began in May 2016, under the umbrella of the 3GPP organisation, which brings together telecommunications companies from around the world. During this process, the research of \[ **3.1**\] was used to compare different types of error correction codes, receiving 39 citations among technical contributions made by Orange, ZTE, Samsung, LG Electronics, Xilinx, Interdigital, Ericsson, ZTE, Samsung, NEC, Nokia, Alcatel\-Lucent Shanghai Bell, Verizon Wireless, Qualcomm and Huawei. Maunder presented 10 technical papers at the 3GPP meetings and led a consortium comprising AccelerComm, Ericsson, LG Electronics, Orange, NEC and Sony \[ **5.12**\] presenting and defending way\-forward proposals that drew upon \[ **3.1**\] and \[ **3.3**\]. These proposals recommended LDPC codes for channel coding in 5G, which was subsequently agreed in November 2016 and standardised across the global telecommunications industry \[ **5.12**\]. This represents a very significant impact on 5G, because LDPC codes had not be used in any previous 3GPP standards and because channel coding is one of the most computationally complex components of 5G, which must be implemented in all compatible equipment and devices. The adoption of LDPC codes in 5G was also supported at 3GPP meetings by another consortium which included \[text removed for publication\], who were influenced by the findings of their collaboration with Hailes \[ **3.3**, **3.5**\]. In the first half of 2020, AccelerComm collaborated with \[text removed for publication\] to define a \[text removed for publication\] standard for \[text removed for publication\] communication. AccelerComm demonstrated that polar coding offers significantly superior error correction capability than the legacy codes previously used in these applications \[ **5.13**\]. 

 **I4. Facilitating 5G deployment:** While the 3GPP standards for 5G global telecommunications precisely define *what* 5G base\-stations and mobile devices must do in order to communicate with each other, the standards do not provide any detail on *how* to do it. In order to educate the global telecommunications industry about how to implement the error correction codes of these standards, Maunder has published the corresponding research conducted at the University of Southampton \(exemplified by \[ **3.1**, **3.3**, **3.6**\]\) in the form of open source simulation models \[ **5.14**\]. These open\-source models have been adopted by 175 researchers and industry experts around the world, in order to form the basis of their own simulation models and to confirm the standards compliance of their products. These models have contributed to the OpenAirInterface, which is providing an open\-source reference solution for complete base\-stations and mobile devices. Furthermore, AccelerComm has contributed to the standardisation of the O\-RAN Alliance, Data Plane Development Kit and \[text removed for publication\] interfaces between hardware and software base\-station components, and has adopted these standards so that AccelerComm products can be integrated into customer products within one day of design effort \[ **5.8**, **5.9**\]. 

 **I5. Influence on Government Policy Debate:** Based on his experience of 5G standardisation and his research on Connected and Autonomous Vehicles \(CAVs\) \[ **3.6**\], Maunder advised the UK government's Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Office of Communication \(OfCom\) on 5G roll\-out as part of an academic panel in November 2017 and individually in March 2018. More specifically, Maunder's advice contributed to the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review policy paper \[ **5.15**\], which sets the target of providing 5G coverage to the majority of the UK population by 2027. In particular, Maunder highlighted the challenges of and potential solutions for motivating Mobile Network Operators \(MNOs\) to invest in deploying the road\-side infrastructure required to provide the underpinning URLLC access for CAVs throughout the UK. This contributed to the recommendation of introducing light\-licensing models to encourage co\-operation between MNOs, as detailed in paragraph 221 of \[ **5.15**\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Stanley’s *Rethinking* project with its three interconnected research initiatives challenges earlier dominant nationalist\-orchestrated views of South Africa’s past, has promoted debates about racial politics and Afrikaner nationalist knowledge\-making, and evidenced the fractured nature of the racialising process. Its Olive Schreiner Letters Online \(OSLO\), Whites Writing Whiteness \(WWW\) and South African War Memorials \(SAWM\) research websites and underpinning digital databases of many thousands of letters, records and commemorative sites, have democratised access to previously little\-known data by enabling a wide range and very large number of citizen\-users to contribute to opening up knowledge\-making of the South African past. Since 2013, many thousands of citizen\-users from 170\+ countries have used the research, which has informed family histories, school syllabi, a TV documentary, radio programmes, multiple books, archivists’ work, commemoration activities, and civil society/commercial concerns. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The project: How did an initially small and always minority number of white people come to dominate and to institutionalise, latterly in the form of apartheid, a system of exploitation and power over a large black majority? Stanley’s interconnected *Rethinking* research projects investigated this and provided innovative ways of thinking about the complexities of the past, initiated by research on white liberals and black radicals in South Africa starting in 1990. The OSLO research started in 2008; WWW in 2013; and SAWM in 2000, with the Edinburgh element of the latter starting 2019. All continue, with impacts for consideration from August 2013 on. They have involved Stanley as PI in three levels of data collection, analysis and output production: \(i\) in researching many thousands of letters, diaries and organisational records and hundreds of commemoration sites, then curating, transcribing and digitising these; \(ii\) in publishing analyses in many academic outputs as well as in blogs and other popular and media outlets; and \(iii\) in constructing and publishing a set of interconnected research websites and digital databases – the OSLO, WWW, and SAWM websites – which provide citizen\-user access to these data. The research has been acknowledged as internationally significant, and a high volume of publications evaluated as outstanding have been produced. 

 South Africa and its racialising process: The research involves re\-thinking knowledge of the South African past, which in earlier times was heavily shaped and orchestrated through nationalist policies and practices. WWW researches and analyses everyday representations of race and racism in everyday ‘documents of life’, particularly letters and diaries, from the 1770s to 1970s and continuing reverberations after this \(3.1, 3.2\). The research begins in the 1770s with the large\-scale arrival of missionaries and other Europeans, and takes the 1970s as a marker of political changes occurring. It has identified a complex ‘racialising process’ in how white people depicted whiteness and its racialised Others, including over time extensions of racial profiling, classification and regulation, and changes in everyday racial terms and usages \(3.3\). This evidences a long\-term complex context to the period of apartheid, with the focus on opening up everyday representational practices and encouraging fresh insights about race matters, public and historical memory, commemoration, and continuing challenges by black activists and white radicals \(3.2, 3.6\). The methodology involves an innovative use of the Qualitative Longitudinal Research approach in investigating and analysing complex changes over time. The framework involves theorisation of both everyday and state formation practices over time around this distinctive racialising process \(3.3\). 

 Racial fractures: Olive Schreiner \(1855\-1920\) is one of South Africa’s most renowned writers, internationally known as a major critic of imperialism and colonialism, and who published widely in both fictional and factual writings. OSLO and its publication of Schreiner’s thousands of letters and manuscript transcriptions has become an internationally recognised benchmark for Schreiner scholarship \(3.4, 3.5, 3.6\). Among other findings, the underpinning research demonstrates the significance of Schreiner’s letters and unpublished manuscripts for understanding her published work and for throwing new light on many links between white radicals and black activists \(3.2, 3.3.\). WWW research highlights the distinctive character of letter\-writing by white South Africans, including Schreiner, describing its constrained emotion and affect regarding race matters, with changes across different contexts and time\-periods importantly showing the fractured, emergent character of racial terms and usages \(3.3, 3.4\). 

 Memory and the past: SAWM research spotlights the important role of active memory\-making and commemoration within the rise and perpetuation of racialised nationalism in South Africa, showing how this informs constructions of past and present \(3.1\). Starting in 2019, earlier data was prepared for publication as a database for research use by citizen\-users, and new data was collected on the black counter\-memorialisation project and its lengthy history, both in preparation for a planned new phase of research, suspended due to the coronavirus. The SAWM database and webpages were launched in June 2020. 

 As a body of work, *Rethinking* research reveals a complex South African racialising process marked by classification and regulation, and also fractures and disjunctures \(3.2, 3.3\). It shows how knowledge of its past has been deliberately shaped by nationalist concerns \(3.6\), albeit with many challenges from black activists and white radicals \(3.2, 3.4, 3.6\). It demonstrates that this racialising process is distinctive and has crucial differences from what happened in the European context \(3.3\).

 4. Details of the impact 

 *Rethinking’s* impact is multifaceted, including extensive public engagement with the research, re\-use of the data, and new projects building upon its foundations. It is used by educationalists at all levels, and has democratised access to sources for rethinking South Africa’s past, both now and in the future. 

 The OSLO, WWW and SAWM research sites produced by Stanley give access to online databases providing research capabilities both for academic use and for citizen\-users \(5.1, 5.2, 5.3\). These are free and internationally available, and designed and delivered in searchable formats appropriate for non\-specialised users with varied levels of experience. Together, they provide access to previously sequestered information about the South African past, enable users to pose and research their own questions, and facilitate new knowledge\-production by citizen\-users including journalists, film\-makers, teachers, genealogists, family historians, archivists, and the wider public. To support and enhance this wide user take\-up, a ‘Lives and Letters’ mailing list of 900\+ subscribers, together with outreach events in North America, UK, and South Africa, have been developed. 

 The extensive international use of the databases is evidenced by world\-wide take\-up and in\-depth use of the most research\-intensive pages, as measured by an independent source, Google Analytics data \(5.1, 5.2, 5.3\). The analytics demonstrate the reach, depth and intensiveness of use by many users internationally over concentrated periods, with page preferences and duration of use indicative of ‘serious’ own\-research investigations. Thus, from January 2014 to June 2018, OSLO was visited by 22,095 users from over 118 countries, who visited OSLO 29,921 times with 152,150 page views \(5.1\). From July 2015 to June 2020, WWW was visited over 18,090 times by 19,025 users from 101 countries, with 43,387 page views \(5.2\). SAWM was launched more recently on 1 June 2020; up to the end of November 2020 visits by users from a range of countries have been increasing, displaying a clear preference for its black counter\-memorialisation pages \(5.3\). 

 The Analytics reports demonstrate high numbers of citizen\-users carrying out their own enquiries, whether for curiosity, family history, business, political, environmental or other purposes, including researching a notorious historical racial murder. User\-initiated contacts and exit polls show impact groups include school and other students, teachers, journalists, genealogists, archivists, family historians, popular researchers, organisations seeking specialist information, as well as leading scholars in the field \(5.2, 5.3, 5.4\). 

 Impacts from WWW demonstrating reach and significance include: 

-  WWW website facilities and the wider research are used extensively in citizen\-users’ own projects, demonstrated in unsolicited information in exit poll responses \(5.2, 5.4\). One user commented that *“This site is a goldmine for researchers, teachers, as well as wider audiences. It really visualized research as process, simply brilliant\!”* 

 Impacts from SAWM demonstrating reach and significance include: 

 The SAWM database was publicly launched in June 2020. While part of the research dates from an earlier period \(and is therefore not being submitted in this ICS\), its 2019\-onwards Edinburgh\-based component adds new research on black counter\-memorialisation sites. Its Analytics reports show it is developing a usage pattern with a strong emphasis on the counter\-memorialisation aspect \(5.3\). 

-  The current research component comprises SAWM’s black memorials and counter\-commemoration research, which includes the key Liberation Heritage Project and earlier sites. This has swiftly become the most used part of the database and website, promoting awareness of black activism and its commemoration \(5.3\). 

 Impacts from OSLO demonstrating reach and significance are: 

-  Numerous user requests, including from auction\-houses, to provide evaluations of letters. Notably, this led to the discovery of c230 previously unknown important Schreiner letters \(5.3\). 

-  Schreiner research impact led to Stanley’s invitation from the renowned Van Riebeeck Society to produce a popular edition of Schreiner letters on South African race issues, *The World’s Great Question.* The VRS Chair stated that, *The VRS – and through it, its members and the general public – are deeply indebted to Professor Stanley and her collaborator… for undertaking this second Olive Schreiner letters project as assiduously as the first. Olive Schreiner’s distinctive epistolary art has been well and truly served by them”* \(5.5\). 

-  Walters and Fogg 2015 extensively reviewed *The World’s Great Question* and described it as a “ *brilliant*” contribution to popular readership of the Schreiner oeuvre \(5.6\). 

-  Driver’s edition of Schreiner’s novel *From Man to Man* uses OSLO transcriptions throughout and describes OSLO research as “ *in the process of transforming Schreiner scholarship*” \(5.7\). 

-  OSLO transcribed letters were the authoritative source when providing Schreiner letter extracts in the Pearson Education *English Today* grade 9 reader, which is used in *all schools* in South Africa \(5.8\). 

-  OSLO research was used to prepare a 2020 popular edition of Schreiner’s *Dreams* collection of stories, informing its editorial apparatus, supplying much of its evidential base, and being used as a source for authoritative information on Schreiner and her associates leading the editor to state that “ *Liz Stanley’s work on Schreiner… has influenced a generation”* \(5.9\). 

-  OSLO transcribed letters were seen as the authoritative source and led to the Tongaat Hulett Sugar Foundation from 2019 requesting permission to feature OSLO letter extracts on its South African sugar sachets, used in all cafés, bars and restaurants \(5.10\). 

 Across all three aspects of the *Rethinking* project, in recognition of the impact of Stanley’s contributions to citizen capacity\-building, in widening access to new forms of knowledge\-making, and to recovery work on black and radical history, she has received ‘extraordinary professor’ awards from the Universities of Pretoria, Johannesburg, and Free State. Stanley has also been awarded the BSA 2020 Distinguished Service Award \(5.11\).

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Underpinning Research: Our research has defined the optimal timing and chemical composition of fungicides to maximise yield from barley crops and has quantified changes over time in fungicide efficacy and pathogen resistance to fungicide. 

 Significance and Reach of Impact: Our research has, since 2006, formed the basis of the definitive national farming advice in the UK through two Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board \(AHDB\) Guides \( *Barley Growth* and *Barley Disease Management*\), latest editions of which were published in 2018 and 2016, respectively. Our research also shaped the advice offered to Irish farmers through the Teagasc Spring Barley Guide, published in 2015. Adherence to this guidance leads to the use of optimal fungicide programmes, through use of the most efficacious fungicides and optimal timing of fungicide application. This helps to minimise barley yield loss and benefits the UK and Irish barley industries by up to GBP113,609,000 and EUR18,300,000 \(GBP16,220,235; 08\-20\) per year, respectively. 

 Our research on the development of pathogen resistance to fungicide allows the AHDB to advise farmers on the best practices for preventing resistance development. Uptake of this advice has extended the effective lifespan of key fungicides by 2 years, which according to a leading agrochemical company has a value of EUR3,700,000 \[GBP3,315,792; 08\-20\].

##  2. Underpinning research 

###  The Challenge: How to optimise barley disease management in the UK and Ireland 

 Barley is the most widely grown crop in Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, and the second most widely grown in the UK. Diseases of barley crops are managed through annual application of fungicides. However, inappropriate use of fungicides, whether through incorrect timing of application or use of lower efficacy products, can adversely affect yield and is a major contributor to pathogens developing resistance to fungicides. Optimal fungicide programmes, comprising both optimal timing of application and selection of the most efficacious fungicides, are therefore important, for both maximizing productivity and safeguarding against fungicide resistance. 

 Our research has developed a thorough understanding of the effects of disease and the timing and selection of fungicides on the levels of yield in barley, as well as an understanding of how optimising fungicide programmes can prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens and protect the overall efficacy of disease control. 

###  Defining the optimal timing and selection of fungicides to maximise yield 

 In 2001, in collaboration with the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service \(ADAS\) and the University of Nottingham, we began to investigate the limitations on the yield of UK\-grown winter barley crops. This research showed that, unlike wheat, winter barley yield is sink\-limited, i.e. limited by the number and capacity of grains to store dry matter, rather than the supply of assimilates for grain filling \[3.1\]. Subsequent research in collaboration with Teagasc \(2011\-2014\) demonstrated that the yield of spring barley is also sink\-limited, even in high\-yielding temperate climates \[3.2, 3.3\]. This work suggested that disease management with fungicides should be targeted early in the life of barley crops first to maximise grain number formation prior to flowering, and then protect the canopy during grain filling. 

 Further projects funded by the UK Government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra; 2004\-2008; 2009\-2013\) and Scottish Government \(2006\-2010\) established the optimum timing and chemical composition of fungicides to maximise yield. This work showed that the canopy does not need to be protected for the entire duration of grain filling \[3.4\], and that early applications of fungicides containing triazole and strobilurin can increase grain numbers and yield even when there is little or no disease present \[3.5\]. This response appears to be the result of direct physiological effects of the fungicides that occur before flowering. This research further highlighted the importance of early application of fungicides to maximise yield. 

###  Annual assessments of fungicide performance to maximise efficacy and minimise development of resistance to disease 

 There is a range of fungicide active ingredients on the market, with new products containing new chemical components introduced regularly. However, the efficacy of fungicide products varies greatly, primarily as a result of the evolution of resistance to fungicides in key pathogens. We have characterised how resistance to chemicals in fungicides develops in key pathogens including *Ramularia collo\-cygni* \[3.6\]. 

 Informed by this understanding, our researchers have worked together with ADAS, the National Institute of Agricultural Botany \(NIAB\) and Teagasc, to conduct annual field assessments of fungicide performance. Through these assessments, between 2013 and 2018, we have demonstrated for example: 

-  efficacy of new succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor \(SDHI\) products and prothioconazole \(member of the azole group\) against *rhynchosporium* leaf blotch 

-  good efficacy of multi\-site fungicides such as chlorothalonil against *ramularia* leaf spot 

-  poor efficacy for folpet against *ramularia* leaf spot 

-  declines in the efficacy of strobilurin group fungicides and older azoles 

-  benefits of using a diverse range of active ingredients and balanced mixtures 

 The results of these assessments are published annually by AHDB for UK farmers and by Teagasc for Irish farmers to provide up\-to\-date advice on best anti\-resistance practices and on selecting the most efficacious fungicides \[5.2\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

###  Impact on farming guidelines 

 AHDB and Teagasc publish the definitive industry guides that set out the founding principles for barley growth and disease management in the UK and Ireland, respectively. Both confirm that aspects of our research on optimal fungicide programmes – timing and selection of product in the UK, timing in Ireland – have made key contributions to these guides: 

####  AHDB advice on Barley Growth and Disease Management 

 Our research \[3.1\] led to the first publication, and forms the foundation, of the AHDB *Barley Growth Guide*. First published in 2006, each subsequent revision \(the most recent of which was in 2018\) has recommended early timings of fungicide application \[5.1a, b\]. More than 12,000 copies have been distributed to growers and agronomists since 2013 \[5.1a\]. 

  

 AHDB also confirms that our work \[3.1; 3.4; 3.5\] has been key to optimising the use of fungicide products for winter and spring barley, and forms the theoretical basis of the AHDB *Barley Disease Management Guide* \[5.1c\]. This is one of AHDB’s more popular publications, with more than 55,000 copies distributed since 2013 \[5.1a\]. The latest edition was published in 2016. 

 In addition to the main *Barley Disease Management Guide*, AHDB maintains a website \(Fungicide Activity Rating \[5.2\]\) of up\-to\-date advice on the selection of appropriate fungicide product and dose to maximise disease management and safeguard against resistance development. This website is updated each year based on our annual field assessments \(described above\) and constitutes the main avenue for publicising those findings. AHDB considers this ongoing project “ *one of \[it’s\] most valued pieces of work*” \[5.1a\] and the website received an average of 1,780 visitors per month in the peak season of March\-May in 2020 \[5.1d\]. 

####  Teagasc Spring Barley Guide: Advice on optimal timing of application 

 We collaborated with a Teagasc team generating a series of papers \[3.2.\-3.3\]. The findings of these, together with follow\-up research by Teagasc staff, led directly to recommendations of earlier timings of fungicide application in the Teagasc *Spring Barley Guide* \(2015\), which forms the basis of spring barley farming advice in Ireland \[5.3a, b\]. More than 10,000 hard copies of this have been distributed, and the online version has been downloaded 9,500 times \[5.3b\]. Teagasc staff also found our research findings on winter barley applicable to Irish conditions, leading to adoption of earlier timings of fungicide application for winter barley \[5.3a\]. 

###  Impact on farmer practice 

 AHDB advice is widely used by growers, independent agronomists and the agrochemical trade to select the most efficacious fungicide products for each year’s farming. UK Pesticide survey statistics \[5.4\] highlight the uptake of this advice by growers; for example, between 2014 and 2016 there was increased usage of the members of the azole and SDHI groups identified as most effective \(prothioconazole and bixafen, respectively\), and multisite fungicides such as chlorothalonil, alongside a decline in use of the least effective fungicides \(e.g. folpet; **Figure 1**\). 


 Figure 1. Number of hectares of barley sprayed between 2012 and 2016 \[5.4\]. 




###  Economic impact 

 Use of optimal fungicide programmes results in improvements to barley yields that are worth up to an additional GBP113,609,000 and EUR18,300,000 \(GBP16,220,235; 08\-20\) annually to the UK and Irish barley industries, respectively \(see below\). In the UK, the economic impact of our work is derived chiefly from the optimal *selection* of fungicide product, while in Ireland it arises predominantly from optimal *timing* of fungicide application. 

####  United Kingdom 

 In the UK, following the 2006 publication of the *AHDB Barley Growth Guide*, the timing of fungicide application had already been optimised everywhere to the recommended early timings prior to the REF2021 census period. However, product selection changes each year based on AHDB advice, which is informed by our annual assessments. Based on data recorded by AHDB \(2014\), the difference in barley yield between the most \(Proline/prothioconazole\) and least \(Phoenix/folpet\) effective fungicides at the time, as assessed by our research, is 0.78t/ha of barley \( **Figure 2**; 5.5a\). Based on a combined spring and winter barley\-growing area of 1,080,000ha \[5.5b\] and weighted average price of GBP135/t in 2014 \[5.5c\], the value of the increase in yield achieved by optimal fungicide use was GBP113,609,340 in 2014. This varies year by year according to changes in barley growing area, price, and weather conditions affecting yield; for example, in 2017 the added value of optimal fungicide programmes was GBP104,521,200 \[5.5d\-f\]. 


 Figure 2. The difference in barley yield \(t/ha\) between the best \(Proline\) and worst \(Phoenix\) performing fungicides, calculated from data reported by AHDB based on our assessments \[5.5a\]. 




####  Ireland 

 In Ireland, the advice on fungicide product selection is provided by other sources, but the timing of application had not been optimised prior to our joint research with Teagasc. Teagasc confirms that through altered timing of fungicide application based on our research, without additional spending on fungicides, the yield of spring barley has improved by 0.5t/ha since 2015 \[5.3\]. With an average spring barley production area in Ireland of 121,000ha between 2015 and 17, and a spot price of EUR140/t \(GBP123; 08\-20\) \[5.6\], yield gains from the revised timings are estimated to be worth EUR8,500,000 \(GBP7,531,738; 08\-20\) annually to spring barley production in Ireland. For winter barley, the altered timings of fungicide application improve yield by over 1t/ha \[5.3a\]. With an average production area of 70,000ha between 2015 and 2017, and a spot price of EUR140/t, this improvement is worth EUR9,800,000 \(GBP8,683,651; 08\-20\) annually to Irish winter barley production. In total, our research optimising the timing of fungicide application is worth EUR18,300,000 annually to the Irish barley industry. 

###  Impact on effective lifespan of fungicides via reduced risk of resistance development 

 Our research \(e.g. \[3.6\] and annual field assessments\) has contributed to extending the effective lifespan of fungicides by 2 years, through helping farmers select the best practices to safeguard against development of resistance in barley pathogens \[5.9\]. 

 Farmers learn of the insights from our research through 3 key routes: 

-  AHDB advice, including the Fungicide Activity Rating website \[5.2\] for which our research has “ *played a key role in identifying emergent resistance to fungicides in barley diseases, allowing AHDB to alert farmers and provide advice to help slow the spread of resistance and mitigate against the decline in efficacy of fungicides*.” \[5.1a\]. 

-  A programme for UK\-wide dissemination, run by the Fungicide Resistance Action Group \(FRAG\-UK\) and hosted by AHDB \[5.7\]. This programme publishes a suite of guidelines, underpinned by our research, including “ *Practical measures to combat fungicide resistance in pathogens of barley*” \(2019\), designed to help farmers select the best practices to minimise the development of resistance. 

-  The Scottish Quality Crops \(SQC\) scheme, which encompasses over 95% of the cereal acreage in Scotland. In July 2018, SQC instated an online integrated pest management planning tool that prompts users to consider the use of diverse ranges of fungicides and balanced mixtures and other measures that our research has shown to maximise fungicide efficacy and minimise the risk of pathogens developing resistance. Completion of this tool is required for farmers to market grain as quality assured \[5.8a\]. Some 2,228 farmers across Scotland had used the tool by the end of 2020 \[5.8b\]. 

 BASF Agricultural Solutions, a leading global solution provider to the agricultural sector, summarises the impact of the uptake of this advice by UK farmers: “ *When we talk about resistance management and the corresponding advice and support given to farmers by  SRUC, we can estimate that by offering stewardship advice and delivering anti\-resistance messaging, the lifespan of agrochemicals can be extended.* \[…\] *With the annual value of products targeted at the barley market alone, this has value in excess of EUR1,800,000* \[GBP1,613,016; 08\-20\] *per annum, equating to EUR3,700,000* \[GBP3,315,792; 08\-20\] *for an extra 2 years lifespan and close to EUR10,000,000* \[GBP8,962,400; 08\-20\] *over 5 years*.” \[5.9\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr Phillips’s work on the International Relations of the Syrian civil war has been at the cutting edge of global research on the subject, subsequently informing and shaping public, media and policymakers’ understanding of the conflict. On a public level, it has led to two exhibitions at the Imperial War Museum in London and Manchester, a BBC Two television documentary, and informed key journalists. At a policy level, it has informed and shaped UK policy in several government departments, notably the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Ministry of Defence, and Ministry of Justice. At a wider international level, policy makers from the UN, NATO, the US National Intelligence Committee, other national governments, and a multinational corporation, ExxonMobil, have had their policies informed by Phillips’s research. 
","
#  2. Underpinning Research 

 Phillips’s research has sought to explain the international dynamics of Syria’s civil war since its outbreak in 2011. When the project began, it was among the first to argue that the international aspects of the conflict were key to understanding its trajectory and any possible resolution, at a time when most policy and academic work was focussed on domestic factors. It also showed how a combination of domestic and regional structural shifts prompted many external states to pursue unachievable policies in Syria, which were ultimately harmful to their own interests. 

 Phillips produced the first book to challenge the prevailing view at the time that the conflict was primarily a domestic conflict that later dragged in foreign powers. The research demonstrated that international factors are a key explainer of Syria’s civil war \[3.1\]. Applying international relations theory and civil war theory to primary evidence in the form of elite interviews gathered in 14 countries, most in the Middle East, Phillips argues that Syria’s civil war \(2011\-present\) was shaped from the beginning by external powers. This international view of the conflict has become increasingly dominant among policy makers and the public, and the book has helped shape this \[3.1\]. 

 Based on field research from Turkey early in the project, Phillips published one of the first policy documents that outlined how Turkey would be impacted by the Syria conflict and argued that it was likely to be drawn into the war – several years before this actually happened \[3.3\]. The report was policy\-orientated, published by the UK’s top foreign affairs think tank, and was launched at a major public event attended by British and foreign diplomats \[3.3\]. 

 Based on field research in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Phillips argued that each lacked the capacity to match their ambitions in Syria, resulting in repeated policy failures \[3.5\]. Applying identity theory to the phenomena of proxy war in Syria, Phillips argued that identity was not the main factor determining why foreign powers backed different fighters in Syria, with pragmatism the primary determinant \[3.4\]. These findings were presented to UK MPs and Lords in 2018 roundtable on Sectarianism in the Middle East. 

 Alongside Phillips’s individual research, he also designed and led a project at Chatham House: ‘The Syria and its neighbour's policy initiative.’ Based on applying nationalism theory to the Syrian case, Phillips argues that the ‘sectarian’ elements of Syria’s conflict are driven as much by modern factors, such as manipulation by foreign powers, as any ancient religious factors \[3.2\]. This project explored the regional dynamics of Syria’s conflict, investigating the role of Syria’s neighbours in the war and the blowback in those countries. It granted Phillips and his team access to stakeholders and policymakers in the UK, US and Middle East, producing a series of reports and research that informed policy makers’ and public views of the conflict. Chatham House published the article ‘What is left of Assad’s state is eroding from within’ \[3.6\], which built on *The Battle for Syria* \[3.1\]. 

 From 2012 until 2020, Phillips produced one monograph and 18 academic articles, book chapters and policy papers \(three co\-authored\) from the research. The primary research output, a monograph, *The Battle for Syria* was and remains the only book yet published on the Syria conflict that focusses primarily on the external drivers of the conflict.

#  Evidence of quality of the research 

 **\[EQR.3.2\]** Chatham House: ‘The Syria and its neighbour's policy initiative’ project ran from 2014\-2017 and won international recognition, being awarded USD504,000 by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, GBP137,000 from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and GBP25,000 from NOREF. 
","
#  4. Details of the impact 

 Phillips’s research on the Syrian civil war has been influential in shaping public, media and governmental understanding of that conflict, which has, in turn, informed international policy. 

#  Informing and shaping public understanding 

 Phillips’s book, *The Battle for Syria*, was the catalyst for his invitation to design and curate a public exhibition on the Syrian civil war for the Imperial War Museum \(IWM\). The exhibition, ‘Syria: Story of a conflict,’ ran in London from April to September 2017 and in IWM North, Manchester, from February to June 2018, receiving over 250,000 visitors. The exhibition aimed to educate the public on the complexities of the conflict, especially the international dimensions, creating opportunities for moving away from the simplistic narratives found in the media. 86% of visitors canvassed stated that the exhibition had provided them with a deeper understanding of the causes, course and consequences of the conflict and 65% stated that the exhibition had made them think differently about the conflict \[5.1\]. One visitor remarked that the exhibition gave them ‘a better understanding of \[the\] history of conflict and \[its\] complexity,’ while another said ‘I will go away with a more comprehensive understanding.’ Others noted ‘It made me feel more closer to what is happening,’ while one visitor stated ‘I think this exhibition is really touching and it made me think how desperate these people are’ \[5.1\]. 

 *The Battle for Syria* underpinned the BBC documentary ‘Syria: The World’s War,’ with Phillips acting as historical consultant, writing and editing scripts and approving footage before airing. The documentary aired on BBC Two in May 2018 and had over 2,000,000 viewers.  [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/03/syria-worlds-war-review-lyse-doucet-dissects-misunderstood-conflict) wrote that the film was ‘tremendous and necessarily distressing’ and that it, ‘tells the story of what actually happened,’ about which ‘we need to be reminded’ \[5.8\]. Phillips has also published over 50 shorter op\-ed pieces in international news outlets, including *The Guardian* \(print readership: 3,600,000; circulation: 111,953\), *The Washington Post* \(circulation: 578,482,00\), *The Atlantic* \(circulation: 462,175\) and *Newsweek* \(circulation: 48,733\). 

#  Informing and shaping media understanding 

 Journalists working on the Syria conflict report that reading *The Battle for Syria* was key for informing and shaping their work. 

 The BBC’s Chief International correspondent, Lyse Doucett, described the book as, ‘indispensable,’ stating that ‘No other book brought together, with Phillips’ depth of research and analysis, an understanding of the international dimension of the world’s most complex and consequential proxy war. No other book examined these crucial factors with an ambition to understand each player’s motives and interests and their impact on the ground – not by taking a side, but by tackling them from all points of view to achieve a fuller more nuanced comprehension…I carried this book with me from capital to capital as we conducted our work. It was the last material I read before every interview with a major player in Syria and the region, as well as London Moscow and Washington. We also consulted Phillips directly as we developed our own analysis on the ground. This book formed the backbone of my research and thinking on the international dimensions of a war.’ \[5.8\]. Doucett is only one of many journalists whose work was shaped by Phillips’s research. 

 *The Independent’s* Patrick Cockburn called it ‘one of the best informed and non\-partisan accounts of the Syrian tragedy yet published,’ while the BBC’s Paul Wood called it ‘a brilliant handbook for policymakers.’ Meanwhile Ian Black of *The Guardian* called it ‘the best by far that I have read on the regional and international dimension’ \[5.3\]. BBC Producer Mike Rudin described *The Battle for Syria* as ‘Matchless,’ stating it ‘provided the pillar of background research for our two\-part BBC 2 series “Syria: The World’s War.”’ He added that ‘Without Dr Christopher Phillips’ unique research our project would not have been possible’ \[5.8\]. 

 Without Phillips’s research and advice, journalism on the Syrian civil war in the last five years would not be as comprehensive, effective and, as in the case of the BBC documentary, produced at all. 

#  Informing and shaping UK Government Understanding 

 Phillips’s research has informed and shaped UK government understanding of the Syria conflict. He has worked with the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \(FCDO\) since 2012 as a consultant analyst. One FCDO analyst commented that ‘Dr Chris Phillips has consistently contributed to the policy debate on Syria within government throughout the past five years as the pre\-eminent UK expert on Syria's regional and international relations’ \[5.2\]. He briefed the UK special representative to the Syrian opposition, the head of the FCDO Syria team and shaped future diplomats’ engagement by recording five podcasts for the FCDO Diplomatic Academy. According to the FCDO, ‘ *The Battle for Syria* and his regular think piece and academic articles \- form one of the main bases for how the long\-term strategic interests of Syria's regional and international partners are viewed’ \[5.2\]. The head of the FCDO’s Middle East Research team remarked that they used *The Battle for Syria* ‘to learn lessons on the extent to which the past positioning of international actors may have affected prospects for conflict resolution.’ They recommend it to officials who are new to working on Syria. \[5.2\] 

 Phillips’s research has also informed UK government policies relating to Syria. Phillips has acted as expert advisor to many government departments on the basis of his expertise on the Syria conflict. After reading his work, the Ministry of Defence \(MoD\) invited Phillips to brief the UK Chief of Joint Operations at Permanent Joint Headquarters Northwood \(PJHQ\) in 2014 and 2016. In 2019, he briefed the MoD’s Defence Intelligence, including operatives participating in operations in Syria and the Land Intelligence Fusion Centre. He helped inform the understanding of future field officers, giving lectures at the Royal College of Defence Studies \(RCDS\) in 2017, 2018, and 2019, and writing and delivering a day long training workshop at RAF Henlow. The Commandant of the RCDS remarked that Phillips’s contribution was ‘consistently outstanding’ and he helped prepare military officers and officials from over 50 different countries for leadership by aiding their ‘understanding of the strategic importance of Syria in the Middle East region as a whole’ \[5.6\]. After reading his research, parliamentary researchers invited Phillips to give evidence on Syria at the House of Commons’ International Development Committee and Foreign Affairs select committees. Phillips also advised David Cameron’s foreign policy team at Downing Street in 2015. After HH Judge Keith Raynor read *The Battle for Syria*, he invited Phillips to lecture at a conference of Judges authorised to deal with cases of terrorism, at the Royal Courts of Justice in 2016, as well as officers from the Crown Prosecution Service later in 2016. According to Raynor, ‘Dr. Phillips’ contribution has informed the legal landscape in relation to terrorism in The Middle East’ \[5.7\]. 

#  Informing global policy 

 Phillips’s research has also informed foreign governments’ policies on Syria in Israel, Australia, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, all governments that have invited him to brief them on Syria. From 2018\-20, he wrote and conducted several two\-day workshops for the United Nations Institute for Training and Research. He briefed the 2013 NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Morocco. He has delivered four lectures at the NATO Defence college in Rome and two at the NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre, each time informing the approach of international policy makers on Syria. One NATO official stated that Phillips’s research allowed ‘members to deepen their understanding of the issues at stake’ \[5.5\]. Another official stated that Phillips allowed them ‘to look at new approaches to the Syria conflict, enhancing their analytical understanding in support of the Alliance’s intelligence function.’ In 2018, he briefed the US National Intelligence Committee in Washington DC. His research has been cited in NATO Parliamentary papers and for the Norwegian Defence Report \[5.5\]. 

 In addition, Phillips’s research has also shaped the policy of a multinational corporation, ExxonMobil. In 2019, he briefed ExxonMobil’s MENA Senior Regional Leadership Team on the Syria conflict and how it may impact their operations. One of them commented that this ‘had a direct impact on improving the company's approach to protecting its people, assets, and operations in Middle East’ \[5.9\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Questions about the nature of morality, truth, and science are of huge importance to audiences across the world, but differences in educational opportunity mean that not everyone can engage with these questions in a critical manner. Research spanning the Philosophy department led to the creation of 2 Massive Open Online Courses \(MOOCs\): *Introduction to Philosophy* and *Philosophy and the Sciences*. 

 These MOOCs **improved access to current philosophical ideas** for diverse learners \(568,392 enrolments from 184 sovereign states\); **changed learners’ perspectives and goals**; **increased learners’ understanding** of philosophical research at Edinburgh; changed **teaching resources** in a range of international settings \(50,108 non\-HEI teachers used, or planned to use, the MOOCs for education purposes\); and **informed other online learning initiatives** globally, e.g. the University of North Carolina \(USA\) and KU Leuven \(Netherlands\) were inspired to launch their own Philosophy MOOCs. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Research from across Edinburgh Philosophy formed the basis of the MOOCs. 11 academic staff members were filmed, and MOOC content drew on research of at least 12 further staff members. Underpinning research for the MOOCs was consequently extremely broad, including at least 67 journal articles, 40 book chapters, and 18 monographs. 

 The following 6 MOOC topics \(out of 17\) provide a sample of how individual MOOC topics were underpinned by research outputs \(associated research funding for these outputs was GBP1.9 million\). A full picture of the underlying research base for the MOOCs was outlined for learners on the “@Edinburgh” webpages of the MOOCs. 

  

1.  “Morality: Objective, Relative or Emotive?” \( *Introduction*, topic 2\): **Matthew Chrisman** argues that the three main approaches to morality – objectivism, relativism, and emotivism – are not rivals and can be synthesised in a unified treatment, a view he explores in his monograph, *The Meaning of ‘Ought’* \[3.1\]. 

1.  “What is Knowledge? And Do We Have Any?” \( *Introduction*, topic 3\): **Duncan Pritchard** argues for an approach to knowledge he calls “anti\-luck epistemology” – knowledge must involve both an “anti\-luck” and an “ability” condition, a position he defends in his article, “Anti\-luck virtue epistemology” \[3.2\]. 

1.  “Should You Believe What You Hear?” \( *Introduction*, topic 5\): **Allan Hazlett** argues in the context of the debate between Hume and Reid on testimony that intellectual autonomy is valuable, not only for individualistic reasons, but also because it would bring broader socio\-political benefits, a view he defends in his article, “The social value of non\-deferential belief” \[3.3\]. 

1.  “Time Travel and Philosophy” \( *Introduction*, topic 9\): **Alistair Richmond** argues that special and general relativity are consistent with a sentient agent having a finitely long personal life that extends infinitely far into the past and future, a view he defends in his article, “On behalf of spore gods” \[3.4\]. 

1.  “Dark Matter and Dark Energy” \( *Sciences*, topic 3\): **Michela Massimi** argues that discrepancies in current models of galaxy formation can be remedied either by adding new entities \(dark matter/energy\), or by modifying the underlying theory \(Newtonian gravity\). She explains how this is an example of underdetermination of theory by evidence in her article, “Three problems about multi\-scale modelling in cosmology” \[3.5\]. 

1.  “Embodied Cognition” \( *Sciences*, topic 4\): **Andy Clark** argues that cognition is not always a brain\-based process. Our cognitive processes sometimes recruit mechanisms in our body and external environment, a position he defends in his monograph, *Supersizing the Mind* \[3.6\]. 

 No prior knowledge of philosophy among learners was assumed. The aim was to introduce underpinning research in a way that would be accessible, engaging, and clear to new audiences. Links between specific journal articles/monographs and MOOC content were forged for learners in three ways: 

  

1.  Key findings from research outputs were discussed directly by authors in their MOOC videos, after introducing them via motivating questions and the surrounding context. 

1.  “@Edinburgh” webpages for each MOOC topic provided a lay description of the Edinburgh research underpinning the topic and a summary of the key research findings, relevant publications, and hyperlinks to open\-access research \(approximately 1,000 words per MOOC topic; 17,000 words in total\). 

1.  A textbook accompanied each MOOC. Each chapter was written by the staff member who taught the MOOC topic and aimed to help bridge gaps in understanding between their research and expected learner’s knowledge \(approximately 6,000 word chapters for each MOOC topic\).

##  4. Details of the impact 

 *Introduction to Philosophy* was launched in spring 2013 as one of the first UK MOOCs. *Philosophy and the Sciences* launched in October 2014. In 2016, *Sciences* was split into two “mini” MOOCs focussed on the *Physical* and *Cognitive* sciences respectively. All of the MOOCs were free for learners to take. 

###  Engaging new audiences with philosophy 

 The MOOCs **enabled** **learners from diverse backgrounds to access philosophy**, many for the first time. Between August 2013 and August 2019, there were 326,598 enrolments for *Introduction*, and 128,938 enrolments for the *Sciences* courses \[5.1, pp. 11, 12\], with the learners being drawn from 184 out of 195 sovereign states as recognised by the UN \[5.1, p. 33\]. 

 25% of *Introduction* learners, and 21% of *Sciences* learners, did not have a university degree \(142,099 people\) \[5.1, p. 16\]. In a survey of course alumni \(629 respondents\), 54% of *Introduction* learners, and 25% *Sciences* learners, said the course was their first encounter with academic philosophy \[5.1, p. 3\]. 

 37% of learners came from outside Europe and North America, and 52% of learners did not have English as their first language \[5.1\]. Learners voluntarily posted transcripts of course videos and translated them into 16 languages. In 2016, a full Chinese\-language version of *Introduction* was created by the hosting platform \(Coursera\) in response to demand from China, generating 13,015 enrolments between 2016 and 2018 \[5.2\]. 

 The reach of these courses is unusual in the humanities. In 2017, *Introduction* was ranked the 17th all\-time most popular MOOC across all subject areas and all providers. Only 9 humanities MOOCs made this global top\-50 list, including only 1 other philosophy MOOC \( *Introduction* was the higher ranked of the two\) \[5.3\]. Alongside the British Council, Edinburgh \(with *Introduction*\) was the only non\-US MOOC provider listed inside the top 50. Within the UK, *Introduction* was ranked 7th and *Sciences* ranked 20th most popular MOOC by enrolment in 2016; they were also the only philosophy courses that made this list \[5.4\]. 

 Compared to more formal educational approaches, completion rates tend to be lower in the MOOCs sector. According to FutureLearn \(the UK’s largest MOOC provider\), 7% of learners who begin one of their courses complete it. Completion figures are comparable for *Introduction* \(6% completion rate\), and markedly higher for *Sciences* \(17% average completion rate\) \[5.1, p. 14\]. 

 The MOOCs **increased understanding of the underpinning Edinburgh research**. 88% of learners testified that it was “valuable” to hear about contemporary Edinburgh research \[5.1, p. 21\]. Learner Stories \(free\-text feedback collected by Coursera\) include references to how the courses “changed my perspective on algorithms, computers, and human mind” \( *Cognitive Sciences*\) *,* and being “totally absorbed by debates on the very nature of scientific knowledge” \( *Physical Sciences*\). From the overall positive reception of the MOOCs, it was evident that the focus on contemporary research, rather than a simple historical overview, was appreciated by learners, for example: 

 “What I particularly liked about the course \[…\] was the fact that the material was very up\-to\-date.” \[5.1, p. 23\] 

 Learners reported that the courses “improved their understanding” of specific Edinburgh research outputs. For example, with respect to the research outputs \[3.1\]–\[3.6\], 74%, 79%, 65%, 49%, 72%, 65% of learners agreed with that statement respectively \[5.1, p. 21\]. 

 The MOOCs **inspired learners to engage further with philosophy**. 87% of learners said they had undertaken further reading or study of philosophy because of the MOOCs \[5.1, p. 19\]. The optional accompanying textbooks sold 6,100 copies \(December 2017\) \[5.5\]. Feedback from Learner Stories describes learners advancing to read source texts, such as this *Introduction* student, reading Pritchard’s monograph on epistemology: 

 “I am just reading *What is \[this\] Thing Called Knowledge* \- not easy but interesting.” \[5.1, p. 18\] 

 Others cited the MOOCs in their decision to study philosophy: 

 “I have been out of education for over 15 years and this has encouraged me to enrol in further philosophy courses.” \[5.1, p. 19\] 

 The MOOCs also **changed learners’ wider perspectives**. 77% of learners said the courses changed the way they think about the world \[5.1, p. 3\]. The courses acted “like a door to open a new world of perspectives”, or enabled participants to “learn the necessary skills \[…\] to become a better thinker in this digital age” \[5.1, p. 24\]: 

 “I learnt that it is in fact okay to question EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING. I am now able to approach and appreciate all subject matter in a way that I would have never been able to before.” \[5.1, p. 24\] 

###  Impact on educational practice 

 The MOOCs **changed teaching resources and delivery**. 10% of learners \(50,108 people\) were education practitioners. In a survey, 21% confirmed that they had or planned to use the MOOCs for education purposes \[5.1, p. 28\]: 

 “I took the course because I am a Philosophy teacher in High school and I wanted to improve as an individual. Everything about the course was just perfect.” \[5.1, p. 27\] 

 Teachers reported using MOOCs for lesson planning, materials, and leadership teaching. One learner notes that the section on embodied cognition will help “in my job in the education sector, particularly in our current thinking about meta\-cognition and self\-talk” \[5.1, p. 27\]. MOOCs were used to bolster teaching provision in existing philosophy courses: exploring points further, supporting reading groups, or as pre\-course watching for A\-Level Philosophy \[5.1, p. 28\]. 

 The MOOCs influenced teaching internationally: *Introduction* is a pre\-requisite for the Bachelor of Elementary Education in Mindano State University, Philippines; *Cognitive Sciences* is recommended for students at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics; and *Physical Sciences* has helped teachers deliver science material on the IB diploma \[5.1, pp. 26–27\]. A high\-school teacher in Mexico reported that *Introduction* allowed him to offer his pupils “better content” and showcase new areas of philosophy to which they did not previously have access \[5.1, p. 27\]. In 2014, the MOOC videos were released on the University of Edinburgh’s Open Education YouTube channel \(4,430 channel subscribers; more than 120,000 views for *Introduction* and *Sciences* MOOC videos as of December 2020\). The videos were released under a Creative Commons license, which allows teachers and pupils around the world to freely view, use, and adapt the course videos without permission or enrolment on the MOOCs \[5.6\]. 

###  Impact on online learning initiatives 

 The MOOCs **informed other online learning initiatives** by showing that online learning in the humanities could reach a large, diverse, and global audience \[5.7\]. According to Coursera, the platform that hosted the MOOCs, the success of *Introduction* “opened and pioneered the way for other humanities MOOCs to even be written” \[5.8\]. As of February 2020, the Coursera platform hosts nearly 750 courses relating to philosophy. 

 In Edinburgh, the MOOCs **directly led to the creation of two new online Masters degrees** in philosophy \(MSc Epistemology, Ethics and Mind; and MSc Philosophy, Science and Religion, which from 2014–15 to 2019–20 \(inclusive\) attracted 413 students, and generated GBP1,954,000 in income\), as well as three further MOOCs which drew on content from researchers at other HEIs \( *Philosophy, Science and Religion*; *Intellectual Humility*; *Know Thyself –* total 30,555 learners\) \[5.7, 5.9\]. 

 The MOOCs also helped **convince other HEIs of the benefits and feasibility of online learning in Philosophy** at both MOOC and degree level. For example, the University of North Carolina \(USA\) and KU Leuven \(Netherlands\), were both inspired by Edinburgh’s example to launch their own Philosophy MOOCs, while Birkbeck, University of London, notes that “Edinburgh’s Coursera course *Introduction to Philosophy* helped convince us of the effectiveness of well\-produced video lectures” \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research carried out by the University of Bristol \(UoB\) to promote and evaluate the systematic uptake of evidence\-based practice \(implementation science\) has demonstrated the benefit of evidence\-based quality improvement for the NHS in maternity and neonatal care. Preventing Cerebral Palsy in Pre\-Term birth \(PReCePT\) was scaled up from a regional to national scale, as an exemplar quality improvement programme within the NHS. PReCePT has enabled maternity and neonatal teams to achieve better neurological outcomes in preterm infants through a successful 85% target national uptake of magnesium sulphate \(MgSO<sub>4</sub>\), benefitting at least 9,000 preterm babies and preventing 207 cases of cerebral palsy. Variability between the 14 English regions has closed from 37\-79% uptake \(2016\), to 81\-97% \(2020\), removing inequalities in health provision. The study has established a UK\-wide community of practice including a national data collection process. The clinical evidence has also informed NICE guidelines and long\-term NHS strategy for maternity and neonatal services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Advances in neonatal medicine have led to progressively better survival rates for preterm infants; however, less improvement has been made in preventing neurological impairment or severe disability. Preterm delivery is the leading cause of Cerebral Palsy \(CP\), with lifelong impact on children and families. Every year in the UK around 500 preterm babies develop CP. 

 Research led by Prof Karen Luyt revealed that current evidence based clinical interventions with proven benefits for neonatal neuroprotection, are underutilised \[1\]. In particular, uptake of magnesium sulphate \(MgSO<sub>4</sub>\), a cost\-effective drug that protects the preterm brain when given to women in preterm labour, was shown to be highly inconsistent across the UK \[1\]. In 2014, only 1 in 3 babies delivered before 30 weeks’ gestation had the benefit of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, a drug that reduces their risk of CP by at least 30%. The Number Needed to Treat below 30 weeks’ gestation to prevent one case of cerebral palsy is 37. The study also highlighted that, despite national recommendations there was a concerning translational gap with implementation into clinical practice \[1\]. 

 Building on this knowledge of an implementation gap, the Preventing Cerebral Palsy in Pre\-Term birth \(PReCePT\) programme was conceived and developed by Prof Luyt in collaboration with colleagues at St Michael’s Perinatal Unit, Bristol. PReCePT is an evidence\-based quality improvement \(QI\) programme that helps to protect preterm babies from avoidable CP \[2\]. In collaboration with, and funded by, the West of England Academic Health Science Network \(WEAHSN\) and the NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Allied Health Research and Care West \(CLAHRC West\), now NIHR ARC West \[ii\], PReCePT was piloted in five NHS Trusts in the West of England to generate an example of local best practice. The pilot used the Institute of Healthcare Improvement \(IHI\) model to undertake Plan, Do, Study, Act \(PDSA\) cycles to design, test and embed practice change, as well as incorporating the principles of coproduction and co\-design, involving parents of preterm babies, obstetric, midwifery and neonatal clinical teams \[2\]. 

 The evaluation of the pilot study showed a positive effect on both knowledge mobilisation and practice across the five maternity units \[2\]. The use of MgSO<sub>4</sub> increased across the West of England from an average \(baseline\) of 21% of eligible babies \(below 30 weeks’ gestation\) over the 2 years preceding the project, to 88% within 6 months, and this was sustained to the conclusion of the research project \[2\]. The pilot also influenced the development of a national data collection process for MgSO<sub>4</sub> uptake metrics as well as providing learning about how to stimulate adoption and spread of evidence using a QI approach across a network \[2\]. 

 From 2017, planning began for a national scale\-up of the PReCePT programme \(2018\-2020\) funded by the Academic Health Science Network \(AHSN\) \[iii\]. In addition, a cluster randomised trial of 40 units nested within the national PReCePT programme \(funded by The Health Foundation \[iv\]\), is comparing two different implementation models of scaling up the PReCePT QI intervention, to establish the most cost\-effective way of implementing new perinatal interventions.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  Streamlining adoption of new innovations in healthcare 

 PReCePT has been scaled up as a national quality improvement \(QI\) programme \(2018\-2020\), across England, using a novel regional Academic Health Service Network \(AHSN\) implementation model. It is one of seven national improvement programmes delivered through the network of AHSNs and commissioned by NHS England and NHS Improvement. Following early success of the initiative, it was also adopted as an exemplar by the Accelerated Access Collaborative, a partnership of patient groups, government bodies, industry and NHS bodies aiming to accelerate the introduction of innovations and transform care \[A\]. 

 PReCePT encourages and enables maternity and neonatal teams to collaborate to achieve better neurological outcomes in preterm infants and has transformed maternity and neonatal clinical team working. It is focussed on improving outcomes around preterm birth and was awarded the HSJ Maternity and Midwifery Initiative of the year \(2019\). The citation from the judges stated: *“This was on a different scale to the other entries. It has had a huge impact with good engagement from other organisations. The judges were particularly impressed with the patient/parent involvement.”.* 

 The PReCePT QI Community of practice comprises more than 2,000 NHS clinical and QI practitioners and patients/parents with a significant social media network. The AHSN PReCePT website hosts a collection of 20 resources \[Bi\] to support practitioner delivery including \(as the top four downloaded resources\) a toolkit, core training presentation, flowchart and implementation guide, with a total 4,020 resource downloads over the two\-year national scale\-up, April 2018 – March 2020 \[Bii\]. Resource downloads in Australia, Canada and Libya show international interest in the PReCePT programme. The PReCePT case study is the most searched and viewed case study on the AHSN Atlas of Solutions in Healthcare website \(1,195 new sessions\). The website also provides resources to promote public awareness, as well as 14 videos \(9,262 total plays\) \[C, Bii\], highlighting the benefit of PReCePT for mothers, families and the clinicians involved. 

 The British Association of Perinatal Medicine \(BAPM\) used the PReCePT model as an exemplar in their National QI Toolkit for Optimisation of the Preterm Infant \[D\]. PReCePT is referenced throughout the BAPM toolkit, which directs readers to PReCePT resources and recommends alignment with PReCePT practice \[D\]. 

 PReCePT developed the national metric for measurement of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, which enabled national level measurement in the National Neonatal Audit Programme \(NNAP\) \[F\]. In November 2020, the NNAP reported that *‘The rate of administration of antenatal magnesium sulphate has risen markedly by over 10% since 2018 \(2016 – 53%; 2017 – 64%; 2018 – 72%; 2019 – 82%\).’* \[F \(Key Finding \(B\)\)\] and linked higher rates of magnesium sulphate administration in 2019 in England \(compared with other UK nations\), to ‘ *the effectiveness of the PReCePT quality improvement programme’*. 

###  Benefit for patients 

 The national scale\-up of PReCePT aimed to achieve at least 85% MgSO<sub>4</sub> uptake in eligible mothers and eliminate variability between regions. Across the 156 maternity units in England the average uptake of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as of 31 December 2020 was 88%, with 7,644 mothers and 9,555 preterm babies \(assuming 25% or pregnancies before 30 weeks gestation are twins/multiples\) benefitting during the two\-year programme \[E\]. Variability between the 14 English regions has also closed impressively; from 37\-79% uptake \(2016\) to 81\-97% \(2020\). By maintaining 85% uptake, the annual year\-on\-year impact will be over 3,000 preterm babies receiving neuroprotection. The implementation gap identified in \[1\] has effectively been closed. 

 Preterm birth is associated with socio\-economic disadvantage and disproportionately affects mothers of BAME heritage. The four English regions with the highest levels of socio\-economic deprivation, according to the Marmot Review \(2019\), were all well below the average national MgSO<sub>4</sub> uptake levels in 2016 and 2017. In 2020 \(after full implementation of PReCePT\), each of these poorest regions are within 1\-2% of the national average of 85%. The gap between the most and the least deprived regions has closed. Consequently, every preterm baby now has equitable access to MgSO<sub>4</sub> neuroprotection to improve their life chances. This has been achieved by investing in a QI intervention equitably in every maternity unit in the nation, as a direct consequence of UoB’s implementation science research. 

###  Informing NHS policy and guidance 

 Early research findings influenced the original 2015 NICE Preterm labour guideline \(NG25\), which recommended intrapartum MgSO<sub>4</sub> in preterm labour below 30 weeks’ gestation. In 2016, a new NICE quality standard \(QS135\) covering care for pregnant women who may be a risk of preterm birth recommended MgSO<sub>4</sub> for women between 24\+0 and 29\+6 weeks of pregnancy \(Quality statement 6\) \[Gi p.29\]. The associated committee briefing paper refers to *‘strong evidence’* from PReCePT regarding increasing uptake \[Gii p.37\]. The 2019 update to The NICE guideline also included a new recommendation on magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection \(Section 1.10\) \[Hi p.13\]. The new recommendation 1.10.1 suggests *‘For women between 23<sup>\+0</sup> and 23<sup>\+6</sup> weeks of pregnancy who are in established preterm labour or having a planned preterm birth within 24 hours, discuss with the woman… the use of intravenous magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the baby’*. This was added following engagement in the consultation process by Prof Luyt on behalf of West of England Academic Health Science Network \[Hii p.23\]. 

 The NHS Long Term Plan \(2019\) sets a target to *‘accelerate action to achieve 50% reductions in stillbirths, maternal mortality, neonatal mortality and serious brain injury by 2025’*. Part of the Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle \(SBLCB\) that supports this target will be to *‘encourage the clinically appropriate use of magnesium sulphate’* \(Maternity and neonatal services 3.11 p.47\) \[I\]. 

 As a result of Key Finding \(B\) of the NNAP report \[F\] \(outlined above\), Recommendation \(2\) of the report stated: “ *Neonatal networks, units and obstetric services should work as a perinatal team to:* 

-  *Ensure that all women who may deliver their baby at less than 30 weeks’ gestational age are offered magnesium sulphate where possible* 

-  *Adopt and implement the following guidance and methodologies to guide improvement:* 

 *ii\)Prevention of Cerebral Palsy in PreTerm Labour \(PReCePT\) quality improvement programme”* 

###  Health economic benefit 

 The average health and social care life\-time cost of each case of CP is around GBP800,000. 7,644 mothers treated translates into at least 207 cases of CP prevented and a combined life\-time cost saving of \~ GBP165 million for health and social care \[E\]. 

###  Informing international clinical practice 

 The Vermont Oxford International Newborn Quality benchmarking Network \(VON\) is the largest global neonatal QI network with a membership of more than 1,300 centres collaborating to improve neonatal care. As a result of the success of PReCePT in increasing uptake of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, VON approached Prof Luyt to write a commentary for their network \(June 2019\) to promote implementation of magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection in preterm infants. Data from the VON Network reveals the increased rate of uptake of MgSO<sub>4</sub> in England compared with Europe and the wider international network \(Figure 1\) \[J\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Newcastle research, reported in REF2014, led to the first\-in\-class PARP\-inhibitor rucaparib. Further Newcastle research and industry clinical trials, involving Newcastle, has shown rucaparib to be successful in treating many cancers driven by somatic *BRCA* and similar mutations resulting in homologous repair deficiency. Thus rucaparib has achieved FDA and EMA approval and NICE recommendation for germline and somatic ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers and FDA approval for germline and somatic prostate cancer. Approximately 43,000 units of rucaparib have been sold, driving increases in revenue for Clovis Oncology, the global licence holders of rucaparib, and an additional 9,000 patients receive rucaparib through international clinical trials.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Unmet need: several cancers are linked to</ins> <ins>BRCA mutations</ins> 

 In the UK, the annual incidence of ovarian cancer is 11.7 per 100,000**Footnote:**

 Cancer Research UK,  [cancerresearchuk.org/health\-professional/cancer\-statistics/statistics\-by\-cancer\-type/prostate\-cancer/incidence\#heading\-Zero](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/prostate-cancer/incidence) and  [cancerresearchuk.org/health\-professional/cancer\-statistics/statistics\-by\-cancer\-type/ovarian\-cancer/incidence\#heading\-Zero](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/ovarian-cancer/incidence), Accessed October 2020. 
and the risk is increased by *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* mutations by up to 63% and 27%, respectively**Footnote:**

 Levy\-Lahad E and Friedman E. \(2007\) Cancer risks among BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. *British Journal of Cancer*. 96\(1\):11–15. DOI: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603535. 
. In addition, these mutations have been observed to increase the risk of other cancers including fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer**Footnote:**

 Finch MS, et al. \(2006\) Salpingo\-oophorectomy and the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutation. *JAMA*. 296\(2\):185\-92. DOI: 10.1001/jama.296.2.185. 
. *BRCA* mutations also increase the risk of prostate cancer, the most common cause of cancer death in UK men \(annual incidence = 79.1 per 100,000<sup>1</sup>\). Though the relative risk for prostate cancer in *BRCA2* carriers is greater than that of *BRCA1* carriers \(RR = 4.65 and RR = 1.82 respectively\)<sup>2</sup>. The breadth of cancers caused by *BRCA* mutations means that a drug effective against these mutations would benefit a wider number of people. 

 <ins>Homologous repair, PARP1 inhibition and</ins> <ins>r</ins><ins>ucaparib</ins> 

 *BRCA* genes encode DNA repair proteins and are involved in homologous recombination repair \(HRR\), a DNA repair mechanism which repairs damage caused by the presence of single strand breaks during cell replication. Mutations in *BRCA* genes lead to errors in DNA repair resulting in the cells becoming homologous repair deficient \(HRD\) and enabling tumour development. Although HRD tumours lack DNA repair via homologous recombination they retain the PARP1 \(poly ADP ribose polymerase\) enzyme which repairs single strand breaks. Therefore, inhibiting the PARP enzyme removes the cell’s ability to repair single strand breaks resulting in lesions in replicating cells and cell death. This process is termed synthetic lethality and makes PARP inhibition \(PARPi\) an effective and specific cancer treatment for all HRD tumours. Newcastle research, in collaboration with Cancer Research UK and Agouron Pharmaceuticals, led to the development of rucaparib, the first\-in\-class PARP inhibitor. 

 <ins>Development of</ins> <ins>r</ins><ins>ucaparib</ins> 

 Newcastle research identified and confirmed the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors through both laboratory investigation and clinical trials, culminating in rucaparib being used as the first PARP inhibitor to treat a cancer patient in a clinical trial setting. Since 2014, further Newcastle laboratory and clinical research has confirmed the safety of rucaparib in treating ovarian cancer \(R1, R2, R3, R4\) and identified that any HRD tumours can be the target of PARPi \(R5, R6, R7\) thereby increasing the number of patients who may benefit from PARPi therapy. 

 Newcastle research using functional assays showed that >50% of ovarian cancers are HRD \(R6\). Newcastle testing showed that 92.8% of the HRD primary ovarian cancer cultures treated with rucaparib had a 2\-fold reduction in cell survival. In contrast, the HRR\-competent cultures remained viable when treated with rucaparib \(R6\). Additionally, HRR status correlated with survival in platinum\-treated patients, with either ovarian or non\-ovarian cancer, suggesting a wider application of PARPi to other cancer types \(R7\). This research was followed by success in ovarian cancer clinical trials involving Newcastle \(see section 4\). In consequence, Clovis Oncology, the worldwide licence holders of rucaparib, expanded its scope to other HRD cancers, particularly prostate cancer.

 <ins>Regulatory impacts for</ins> <ins>r</ins><ins>ucaparib</ins> 

 Between 2014 and July 31<sup>st</sup> 2020, rucaparib secured FDA, EMA and NICE regulatory approvals for ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal and prostate cancers, caused by both germline and somatic *BRCA* mutations \(see diagram and EV1\). In Europe, rucaparib was approved for use in 2019 by the EMA and within the Cancer Drugs Fund by NICE for the “ *treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated \(germline and/or somatic\), high\-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum\-based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum\-based chemotherapy*” \(EV1\). In the US, rucaparib was approved in 2019 by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of “ *adult patients with deleterious BRCA mutation \(germline and/or somatic\) associated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies*” \(EV2\). 

 The initial Breakthrough FDA approval for rucaparib \(EV3\) was underpinned by two clinical trials, Study 10 \(clinicaltrial.org ID: NCT01482715\) and ARIEL2 \(NCT01891344\), both of which had Newcastle input: the President and CEO of Clovis Oncology stated “ *Newcastle expertise was… essential to the successful completion of Study 10 and ARIEL2 clinical trials demonstrating rucaparib’s safety and efficacy and which ultimately informed regulatory approval decisions.”* \(EV3\). Study 10 was the first phase I–II study to evaluate single agent oral 

rucaparib at multiple doses \(R3, R4\). Results showed that *“Rucaparib was tolerable and had activity in patients with platinum\-sensitive germline BRCA1/2–mutated \[High\-grade Ovarian Carcinoma\]*” \(R4\). EMA and NICE approval of rucaparib were informed by the subsequent ARIEL3 clinical trial \(NCT01009190\). 

 Showing that rucaparib was effective against all HRR deficient tumours expanded the potential targets for therapy. This gave confidence to Clovis to trial rucaparib in prostate cancer and other solid tumours with HRR mutations \(as confirmed by the CEO, EV3\). The subsequent TRITON2 clinical trial \(NCT02952534\) led to 2020 FDA approval of rucaparib for the treatment of adult metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer patients with deleterious germline and/or somatic *BRCA* mutations \(EV2, EV4\). Regulatory approval for rucaparib in prostate cancer expands its application to a greater population of patients with *BRCA* mutations. 

 <ins>Impact</ins> <ins>on</ins> <ins>patients</ins> 

 Clinical trials are often the only way cancer patients can receive novel non\-chemotherapeutic treatment. As of July 2020, approximately 9,000 patients have received rucaparib through various clinical trials, including 136 as part of Study 10, 493 as part of ARIEL2, and 375 patients \(breast, ovarian/peritoneal, and other primary cancers\) as part of ARIEL3 \(EV5\). In addition, ovarian cancer patients are receiving rucaparib through the ongoing international phase III ARIEL4 \(NCT02855944\) and ATHENA \(NCT03522246\) trials, testing rucaparib versus chemotherapy and rucaparib in combination with nivolumab. ARIEL4 aims to recruit 345 patients \(EV6\) while the ATHENA trial completed recruitment of 1,000 patients in June 2020 \(EV7\). 

 Following the success of trials in ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer, the Clovis\-run TRITON2 trial investigated rucaparib in 360 prostate cancer patients \(EV6\). Patients showed an objective response rate of 53.6%, i.e. a reduction in tumour size and/or number \(EV8\), ultimately informing the FDA approval of rucaparib for castration\-resistant prostate cancer \(EV4\). 

 The efficacy of rucaparib is also being investigated in at least 49 other international clinical trials covering 13 cancers \(including lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancer\), with a total recruitment target of 6,380 patients, including those with *BRCA1* and *2* mutations and other homologous recombination defects \(EV6\). 

 <ins>Economic impact</ins> <ins>on</ins> <ins>Clovis from sales of Rucaparib</ins> 

 In 2011, Pfizer sublicensed the worldwide rights of rucaparib to Clovis Oncology. Between 2016 and June 2020, Clovis Oncology reported $376.5M net product revenue for rucaparib \(EV9\). This equates to over 43,000 units of rucaparib with sales growing year on year \(see graph below\). As the first territory to gain approval \(FDA approval, 2015\), the US has seen sales of $288.2M \(approx. 33,000 units\), and sales are also growing in other countries with $5.8M \(approx. 660 units\) reported between January 2019 and June 2020 \(EV9\). Additionally, since 2017 Clovis has provided rucaparib free of charge to eligible patients in the US under its Patient Assistance Programme \(EV4\). An average of 20% of the US commercial supply of rucaparib \(the equivalent of a further $82.3M or approx. 9,400 units\), has been provided to patients free of charge who otherwise would not be able to access the drug \(EV4, EV9\). The economic impact of rucaparib allows Clovis to employ 450 people in the US and Europe \(EV4\). 

 <ins>In summary</ins> 

 Rucaparib has been recognised as a leading PARP inhibitor for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal and prostate cancer. It is being provided as a treatment option for thousands of patients and its further development and application are being actively pursued by Clovis and other clinical institutions.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Drug\-drug interactions \(DDIs\) are a major cause of harm, affecting 25% of people on HIV treatment. We developed prescribing tools to identify and manage DDIs in HIV and hepatitis. Our resources are now standard of care in over 30 countries, and have been translated into Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese. Between January 2017 and December 2019, over 17,500,000 interactions have been returned from 50,000 unique monthly users across 220 countries and territories. The tools identify missed DDIs in up to 95% of prescriptions and change clinical management in 55% of cases resulting in demonstrable economic benefit. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 We recognized the huge danger of drug\-drug interactions \(DDIs\) with HIV and hepatitis treatments and were the first to report harmful DDIs involving HIV\-TB coinfection \[3.1\]. We were also the first to report the beneficial boosting of HIV protease inhibitors in patients. 

 Between 2012 and 2018, we participated in large\-scale studies to characterise the frequency and severity of DDIs worldwide. Of approximately 39,000 patients from the UK, Switzerland, Spain and Uganda, significant DDIs were reported in 18\-35% of patients taking antiretrovirals \[3.2\-3.5\]. DDIs with the highest risk and greatest consequence involved: antibiotics, antifungals, central nervous system drugs, cardiovascular drugs and corticosteroids. 

 With our expertise in DDIs, we developed an electronic point\-of\-care HIV drug interaction tool in 2000, providing prescribing support in the form of interaction recommendations on the likelihood of DDIs between HIV drugs and commonly prescribed co\-medications. This involved the collation of all available drug information including University of Liverpool and external DDI studies, published drug labels and expert predictive pharmacokinetics. We also developed systematic evidence evaluations based on the GRADE method, where all interactions were given a score based on the quality of evidence \[3.6\]. 

 In 2011, direct\-acting antivirals \(DAAs\) were introduced to treat hepatitis C virus \(HCV\). Despite DAAs improving tolerability and efficacy, DDIs were an emerging challenge with the potential to cause patient harm and treatment failure. We recognised the clinical need for prescribing support and developed the hepatitis drug interaction tools. We have since expanded the hepatitis resources to include more hepatic diseases, including non\-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma \(2019\). 

 Our DDIs tools are unique and work to current standards. Each tool has a disease\-specific focus, working to our clinical and scientific expertise, allowing us to possess greater coverage than other DDI resources. We have systematically evaluated over 80,000 DDIs across all tools, providing detailed DDI commentaries for each interaction, whereas drug labels, in comparison, can often be particularly sparse. Our comprehensive database includes a wide range of co\-medications including recreational drugs and herbal therapies. Our robust and transparent evidence evaluation process, developed over 20 years, ensures we always provide accurate and reliable drug information. We also include clinical management advice in our interaction recommendations where possible. Quality assurance and ongoing maintenance is constantly undertaken, updating our tools in light of emerging data and guaranteeing our tools are consistently up to date.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 We have developed a suite of world\-leading prescribing tools to identify and manage drug\-drug interactions \(DDIs\) in HIV and hepatology. 

 The DDI tools developed by Liverpool are available in many formats, allowing them to be accessible to as many healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients as possible. We have drug interaction websites, including low\-bandwidth versions, and mobile apps for each disease area. We work with patient advocacy groups, such as i\-Base, to determine the most appropriate and informative ways to provide drug information to patient audiences. Our DDI tools are used globally and have been integrated into electronic prescribing systems in Australia and Uganda. A Japanese version of our hepatology tool was launched in 2017 and Spanish and Portuguese versions of our HIV tool are launching in 2021. Building on the experience gained from developing HIV and hepatology prescribing tools, we identified a clinical need to expand our suite of tools to include cancer \(2017\) and COVID\-19 \(2020\). 

 Our prescribing tools have delivered major impact in preventing harms as described below: 

##  High uptake by prescribers worldwide and incorporation into national/international health policy 

 Since DDIs were identified as a challenge to the successful and cost\-effective treatment of HIV and hepatic diseases, our DDI tools have been used by healthcare professionals in their clinical practice to optimise treatment and improve DDI management.

 **B** 





 **A** 

The tools have increased in importance as evidenced via the scale and geographical spread of their use \[5.1\]. Amount and breadth of usage of both the HIV and hepatology resources has consistently increased year\-on\-year since launch. As depicted below \(figure A\), the HIV and hepatology tools have over 50,000 users each month, from 220 countries and territories, responding to over 500,000 DDI queries \[5.1\]. The Liverpool tools are recommended for use in every HIV clinic in the UK \[5.2\], have established users across Western Europe and North America, and are increasingly used in Latin America, Asia and Africa \[5.1\]. 

 With established global use and continuous dissemination, the resources are recognised by national and international clinical associations and societies, and have been cited over 50 times in treatment guidelines in more than 20 countries \[5.3\]. Our DDI charts also form the basis of the DDI sections of the World Health Organization \(WHO\) HIV treatment guidelines, European HIV treatment guidelines and the European Association for the study of the Liver treatment guidelines \[5.3\]. With considerable global reach and influence, these treatment guidelines recognise our resources to be world leading DDI management tools. 

 The HIV tools \(figure B\) are recognised as being some of the most clinical useful and important resources in HIV clinical management, with the Chair of the WHO HIV Guideline Review Committee stating that “ *WHO* *recognises the Liverpool HIV Drug Interactions website to be a world\-leading resource….We rely on the information provided to develop global guidelines for the treatment and care of people living with HIV, and are very grateful to be able to reproduce the information from this site in our guidelines*” \[5.4\]. This is reinforced by the Chair of the British HIV Association, who said “ *the Liverpool resources are cited as one of the most useful tools in HIV patient care. They are widely trusted and relied upon the world over. It is a great British invention, bringing benefit to patients and indispensable for prescribers*” \[5.4\]. 

 The hepatology tools, developed almost 10 years ago, are also recognised as vital resources for clinical management of hepatic diseases. The President of the British Association for the Study of the Liver said that “ *All those involved in HCV treatment would be lost without these trusted, freely available and up\-to\-date resources: they are a vital aspect of HCV patient care in the UK*” \[5.4\].This is supported by the Guidelines Chair of the European Association for the Study of the Liver, who said *“The efforts made by the authors had, and still have, a major influence on HCV treatment practices worldwide, in the context of eliminating viral hepatis as a public health threat by 2030*” \[5.4\]. 

###  Prevention of harm though demonstrable change in patient management as a direct result of actionable information 

 Between January 2017 and December 2019, over 17,500,000 DDIs have been queried using the HIV and hepatology tools. Approximately 23% of these queries have identified a potentially clinically significant DDI. Knowledge of an interaction can avoid harm to the patient and thereby reduce healthcare costs \[5.1\]. 

 One specific example of how the DDI tools have prevented harm to patients is the integration of the HIV drug interactions checker into the electronic prescribing systems of one of the largest HIV clinics in sub\-Saharan Africa \(the Infectious Diseases Institute, Uganda\). Since 2013, internal data and patient surveys have indicated that this integration has reduced the prevalence of significant DDIs in 4,556 patients by one third, with half of all affected prescriptions being subsequently altered. A follow up study used the HIV checker to carry out DDI screening in clinics where the tool had not been integrated. At baseline study visits, prescribers were aware of only 4.60% of clinically significant DDIs. Performing DDIs checks with the tools provided new information in 60.20% of cases and directly changed patient management in 55.60% of cases \[5.5\]. 

###  Changes in clinical practice and knowledge transfer 

 By identifying and addressing knowledge gaps in both drug interaction studies and DDI education, we have contributed to changes in drug labelling and clinical behaviour, resulting in changes to clinical practice. 

 In 2013, for example, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of artemether, dihydroartemisin \(DHA\) and lumefantrine during and after stopping rifampicin. Administration of rifampicin and artemether\-lumefantrine significantly decreased levels of artemether \(89%\), DHA \(85%\) and lumefantrine \(68%\) compared to artmether\-lumefantrine alone \[5.6\]. Prior to the study, no data existed on these drug interactions, but drug labels have since been revised to state that concomitant use of artemether\-lumefantrine with rifampicin is contraindicated \[5.6\-5.7\]. 

 In addition to the need for prescribing support tools, we have also recognised the need for improved DDI education. We have developed and hosted educational events, demonstrating the utility of the tools to aid clinical management. These events have taken different forms: we have hosted symposia sessions at HIV Glasgow and the European AIDS Conference \(EACS\), collaborated with Virology Education to deliver events in Europe and have now developed virtual educational events for a global audience in 2020. Our events have been very popular, with recent sessions at EACS 2019 and IAS 2019 having 700 – 1,000 attendees. 

 With each event, the content is adapted to focus on emerging topics in HIV and hepatology clinical management whilst also being tailored to meet the educational requirements of a particular audience, context or setting. We work with our global network of key opinion leaders, supporters and advocates to ensure the content of each event is of the highest standard and clinical relevance. 

 In November 2020, we developed and hosted an online educational event, ‘Liverpool Masterclass in Antiviral Pharmacology’. The workshop was targeted at healthcare professionals with a focus on the Liverpool tools and clinical pharmacology of DDIs in HIV, hepatology, cancer and COVID\-19. A series of interactive and engaging talks and cases were given by Liverpool faculty and members of the drug interaction group. We also encouraged registrants to submit cases to be discussed during the workshop. 

 Accredited by the Royal College of Physicians, the workshop had 281 attendees from 35 countries. Workshop feedback was extremely positive, where 100% of survey participants would recommend the meeting to a colleague, 97% of participants \(strongly\) agreed that the workshop was relevant to their clinical practice and 94% of participants \(strongly\) agreed that they had a better understanding of the role of the Liverpool tools in patient management \[5.8\]. 

###  Economic benefits to healthcare systems 

 Between January 2017 and December 2019, the HIV tools had an average of over 23,000 unique monthly users, from 220 countries and territories, searching for over 8,500,000 interactions, of which 2,000,000 were classified as clinically significant \[5.1\] and were either contraindicated combinations or required clinical intervention \(monitoring and/or treatment change\). Alerts for clinically significant DDIs have resulted in avoidance of harm to patients and potential cost savings to healthcare systems. 

 Using the Liverpool tools, Demessine et al. have estimated the cost of HIV\-related DDIs to the French healthcare system to be approximately GBP2,021 for 1\-year follow\-up per individual \(USD2,693 \(03\-2019\)\) \[5.9\]. 

 Using data from the Climate\-HIV database, 0.90% of HIV patients in the UK, of which there are estimated to be 100,000, are prescribed a medication which is contraindicated. Through the avoidance of such drug combinations, we estimate savings of approximately GBP1,818,900 \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Drowning is the third most common cause of accidental death worldwide, accounting for around 320,000 deaths annually \(World Health Organization, 2020\) and around 200 deaths during sport and leisure activities each year in the UK \(Water Incident Database\). Original research from the University of Portsmouth \(UoP\) underpins ‘Respect the Water’, a national water\-safety campaign that has increased awareness of the dangers of cold water, changed water\-safety behaviour and saved the lives of children and adults. Our research underpins water\-safety training delivered to over 100,000 children across the UK, has been incorporated into the practice, policies and recommendations of national and international water\-safety organisations, and has changed UK legislation for lifejacket usage, preventing the deaths of fisherman. We have increased understanding of the causes of drowning\-related deaths, informed medical guidelines for treating immersion casualties and underpinned UK, US and international Search and Rescue guidelines that are used in 162 countries by 99% of the world’s merchant shipping. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The outputs underpinning this case study were led by **Professor Michael Tipton**, in conjunction with other members of the Extreme Environments Group \(EEG\) at UoP. These outputs represent a significant body of water\-safety research, founded on the city’s maritime and naval heritage, and undertaken with input from relevant stakeholders and collaborators. The research intersects at each stage of the drowning timeline, a model of the stages of the drowning process \( *Am J Emerg Med*. 2016, 34\(11\): 2224\-2226\), developed by **Tipton** in collaboration with the International Drowning Research Alliance \(\[IDRA\]  [http://idra.world/](http://idra.world/)\). 

 \( **R1**, **R2** and **R3\)** are examples of our research examining the ‘cold shock’ response, a series of physiological responses evoked by immersion in cold water, characterised by an ‘inspiratory gasp’, hyperventilation, elevated heart rate, and peripheral vasoconstriction. These responses are temporarily debilitating and can be life threatening; they are implicated in sudden death on initial immersion and the observation that 40% of drownings occur within 2m of safety \(International Lifesaving Federation, 2010\). Building on **Tipton**’s earlier work on cold shock, the EEG undertook a series of studies investigating the role of anxiety and threat appraisal on cold shock \(for a summary see: *Front Psychol*. 2018, 11; 9: 510\). \( **R1**\), which is a representative example from this body of work, investigated the effect of elevated anxiety, induced through a deception manipulation, on the cold shock response in adults. The research demonstrated that, compared to a non\-deception control, anxiety increased the magnitude of the cold shock response upon cold water immersion. \( **R2**\), conducted in collaboration with colleagues from King’s College London, demonstrated that the simultaneous activation of parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic inputs to the heart, which may occur during cold\-water submersion, increased arrhythmias in an animal model with long QT syndrome \(a heritable condition linked to sudden cardiac death\). This supported our ‘autonomic conflict’ hypothesis for explaining sudden death during cold\-water immersion *\(J Physiol*. 2012, 15; 590\(14\): 3219\-3230\), and together with \( **R1**\), provided empirical evidence for safety strategies that minimise anxiety upon cold\-water immersion. \( **R3**\) examined the physiological responses of children undergoing cold\-water immersion, providing the first published evidence of the cold shock response in children. This indicated that safety behaviours to mitigate cold shock would be relevant for children, as well as adults. 

 Given the debilitating effects of cold shock, the actions taken before and during the initial minutes of immersion are critical in determining survival. \( **R4**\), funded by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents \( **G1**\), investigated the buoyancy of different clothing assemblies upon immersion in water, when floating and swimming. In a series of laboratory and field trials with adults, adolescents and children, it was demonstrated that clothing layers significantly improved buoyancy and airway freeboard \(mouth to water distance\) on immersion. This supported our recommendation that the primary survival behaviour for adults and children upon accidental immersion should be to ‘float first’, until the cold shock response is reduced. \( **R5**\), funded by Royal National Lifeboat Institution \(RNLI; **G2**, **G3**\), examined the effect of a crotch\-strap retention system on lifejacket performance; reference to lifejackets ‘riding up’ over the torso and head was evident in a number of fatal accident reports. Lifejacket performance was assessed following a vertical water entry and in 3\-hour exposures to waves using a custom\-built ‘drowning manikin’, to estimate the time taken to inhale the lethal seawater dose. Compared to a no crotch\-strap condition, airway freeboard was greater with a crotch\-strap and the time taken to aspirate the lethal dose of seawater for drowning doubled, indicating improved airway protection. 

 Once an individual becomes immersed in water, rescuers must be able to accurately estimate survival time to coordinate rescue efforts and, subsequently, to review the incident to prevent future occurrence. \( **R6**\), undertaken in collaboration with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, details a retrospective analysis of fatal maritime incident data collected between 2007 and 2016. The research identified that 180 lives \(47% of all cases\) could have been saved if a lifejacket had been worn and provided empirical support for the use of lifejackets. \( **R7**\), funded by the US Coast Guard \( **G4**\), used data from the UK National Immersion Incident Survey to model survival capability for immersion victims. This is the largest database of its kind and includes information about the physical attributes of the immersion victim, environmental conditions, duration of immersion, and survival. From these data, the most significant factors determining cold\-water immersion survivability were identified and a mathematical model was produced to predict survival time in cold water.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 ‘Respect the Water’ is a nationwide, multimedia, water\-safety campaign launched in 2014 by the RNLI with the aim of reducing drowning deaths in the UK and Ireland. Throughout this campaign, **Tipton** has acted as scientific advisor to the RNLI and been a member of the RNLI Council and Medical Committee. He has appeared in campaign material, given radio and television interviews in support of the campaign, and undertaken a 24hr Ask Me Anything on cold\-water survival on the online platform Reddit \(19/12/2017\); a substantial amount of campaign footage was filmed in the UoP’s Extreme Environments Laboratory. **The initial campaign theme ‘Treat the water with respect, not everyone can be saved’ was underpinned by our research on cold shock** \( **R1\-3**, **S1**\). Between 2014 and 2016, the campaign discouraged cold water entry by highlighting the physiological incapacitation and negative physiological consequences of the cold shock response \( **R1\-3**\), the risks arising from reduced breath\-hold time \( **R1, R3**\), and the effect of anxiety on this response \( **R1**, **R2**\). However, recognising that just under 50% of those who enter cold water do so unintentionally, the campaign message shifted in 2017 to mitigate the impact of cold shock, instructing people to ‘Fight your instincts’, relax and ‘Float to Live’ until breathing is back under conscious control \( **S1**\). **This safety advice was directly underpinned by our research demonstrating the buoyancy provided by trapped air between clothing layers,** and advocated floating \(‘float first’\) as the primary survival behaviour upon accidental water immersion \( **R4**\). The direct link between our research and the water safety advice underpinning this campaign is typified by the information on the campaign website \( [https://www.respectthewater.com/](https://www.respectthewater.com/)\). This includes a video presented by **Tipton** describing cold shock and how to overcome this \(‘how to survive cold water shock’\), a ‘Floating Facts’ section, referencing our research \( **R4**\) and including floating instructions, a 3D interactive graphic, and a video on how to float if immersed \( **S1**\). 

 The reach of ‘Respect the Water’ has been substantial. In the first month of the 2017 campaign, 5,700,000 males \(a target demographic accounting for more than 90% of coastal drownings\) were reached through social\-media. In 2018, 535 items of print and broadcast media reached 46,000,000 people \( **S2**\), 266,000 people visited the campaign website and **more than 50% of  young men in the UK were aware of ‘Respect the Water’** \( **S2**\). The ‘Float to Live’ YouTube video \( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jncVb2onYC4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jncVb2onYC4)\), underpinned by our work, has received over 13,000,000 views, with a ‘Cold Shock’ video featuring Tipton viewed over 79,000 times \( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRRIuH7Cp78](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRRIuH7Cp78)\). The significance of ‘Respect the Water’ has been pronounced, resulting in increased awareness and understanding of water safety, behavioural changes, and saved lives. RNLI data following the 2018 campaign demonstrated that the proportion of young men in the UK taking precautions near the water rose from 77% to 87%, with a significant increase in the number saying that they would ‘float first’ if accidentally immersed. Across the 2017 to 2019 campaigns, **22 individuals contacted the RNLI to say that the ‘Float to Live’ technique saved their life** \( **S2**\). This is exemplified by testimony provided by an individual who used ‘Float to Live’ advice in a survival situation: ‘ *I panicked for a few seconds and that’s when I remembered the radio commercial that told me to float instead of fighting the water. I just lay back and started floating and kicking my legs… It saved my life*.’ \( **S3**\).  More recently \(July 2020\), the impact of our work was evidenced in the statements of an RNLI coxswain after recusing a 10 year old boy who was found floating with arms and legs spread, half a mile from shore ‘… *he’d been watching lifeboat rescues on ‘Saving lives at Sea’* \(BBC television programme\) *and followed the* *advice given on the show* … *had he not, the outcome might have been very different*’ \( **S3**\). 

 According to the UK Water Incident Database, approximately 40 young people drown in the UK every year. The ‘Swim Safe’ programme, delivered by Swim England and the RNLI, has run annually between May and September since 2013. This programme teaches children aged 7\-14 how to be safe in, and around, open water. It has now **been delivered to over 100,000 children** and includes information on ‘cold shock’ \( **R3**\), advocates ‘float first’ as a primary safety behaviour and provides practical floating tuition \( **R4**\). An independent evaluation indicates that this **has been effective at improving children’s water safety knowledge**. For example, before ‘Swim Safe’, only 38% knew that the cold water makes it difficult to breathe normally; this rose to 69% after the programme \( **S4**\). The RNLI have also produced a range of free educational resources \( [https://rnli.org/youth\-education/education\-resources](https://rnli.org/youth-education/education-resources)\) for delivery in schools, including lesson plans, posters, and videos on ‘cold shock’ and ‘Float to Live’, tailored for Key Stages 1\-4. These were all reviewed and approved by **Tipton**. At a local level, in 2019, **Tipton**, in partnership with Hampshire County Council and the RNLI, developed ‘Stay Afloat’, a free, downloadable, water safety education resource pack underpinned by our water\-safety research \( **R1\-4**\) for Key Stage 3 and 4 children across Hampshire \( [https://www.hants.gov.uk/educationandlearning/stayafloat](https://www.hants.gov.uk/educationandlearning/stayafloat)\). This has been delivered in Hampshire schools, with our own research on more than 1,000 children demonstrating significantly increased awareness of the dangers of cold\-water shock and the appropriate behaviours to take if immersed, which was retained 3\-6 months later. 

 Our research \( **R4**\) also underpins the **Royal Life Saving Society’s Water Safety Code** \( **S5**\) and has been incorporated into the **Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents guidance for Managing Safety at Inland Waters** \( **R1\-4**, **S6**\). ‘Float first’ is now recommended by the **UK Coastguard** to 999 callers for maritime in\-water incidents, and internationally, by the **Alaska Office of Boating Safety**, a US Government Department. Our body of water safety research has also been utilised in the 2015 **European Resuscitation Council Guidelines for Resuscitation,** the 2016 **Wilderness Medical Society Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Drowning,** and the **International Liaison Committee On Resuscitation’s 2015 Advisory Statement on Guidelines for Reporting of Data of Drowning Related Resuscitation.** A 2019 podcast \(Drowning: Roadside to Rescue\) produced by ‘The Resus Room’, a medical education site focusing on patient care in and around the resuscitation room, was based on our water safety research and listened to by more than 17,000 people within the first 5 months. 

 Based on \( **R5**\), **the use of crotch straps on lifejackets is now recommended in the UK by the RNLI** \( **S7**\) **,** as well as internationally by the **New Zealand Coastguard** \( **S8**\) **,** who advocate their use to improve lifejacket function. \( **R6**\), demonstrating the number of lives that would have been saved if individuals had been wearing lifejackets, was undertaken by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency Casualty Review Panel, which **Tipton** is a member of. This research **underpins the Maritime and Coastguard Agency Marine Guidance Note \(MGN\) 588** \( **S9**\). This legislation, published in 2018, mandates that all UK fishermen on fishing vessels must be provided with, and wear, personal floatation devices, unless measures are in place which eliminate the risk of falling overboard. **This applies to approximately 12,000 UK commercial fisherman** and, based upon estimates of the number of deaths per year among commercial fishermen that would probably or possibly have been prevented with lifejacket use \( **R6**\), **will save 2\-4 lives per annum**. \( **R6**\), as well as the ‘Respect the Water’ Campaign, underpinned by our research \( **R1\-4**\), are referenced in the **National Water Safety Forum’s UK National Drowning Prevention Strategy** \(2016\-2020\), where they highlight the need for improved understanding of water safety behaviour and demonstrate how the UK is increasing awareness of risks around water \( **S10**\). This National Strategy was produced in response to a World Health Organization report recommending that every country has a water safety strategy, and launched at the House of Commons in 2016 by the Minister of State for Transport. In 2019, the National Water Safety Forum stated that they were ‘ *cautiously optimistic*’ that the Strategy was being effective and  ‘ *the overall reduction over the three years is a good indicator that our efforts are paying off and fewer people and families are affected by drowning*’. 

 Finally, our research modelling survival times in cold water \( **R7**\) has been incorporated into the 2019 **UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\) Flood Rescue Concept of Operations** \( [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flood\-rescue\-concept\-of\-operations\-2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flood-rescue-concept-of-operations-2019) pg. 42\) and underpins the survivability model within the **UK Fire and Rescue Service National Operational Guidance on Rescue from Water** \( [https://www.ukfrs.com/scenarios/rescue\-water](https://www.ukfrs.com/scenarios/rescue-water)\), guiding the time and resources devoted when searching for individuals immersed in cold water. Internationally, within the **United States Coast Guard \(USCG\),** our survival prediction research has ‘ *provided critical input into the ACTSUS* \(Active Search Suspended Pending Further Developments\) *decision making process’* \( **S11**\). The significance of this work is profound because **the ACTSUS decision determines the resource to be allocated and the point at which search is suspended by the search and recuse planner** \( **S11**\); this ‘ *represents a critical juncture for the victim, their families, and the USCG*’ that is ‘ *tantamount to declaring the victim dead using only circumstantial evidence*’ \( **S11**\). The reach of this work is substantial; the USCG has 22 million square miles of responsibility and undertakes 20,000 search and rescue cases each year. Moreover, \( **R7**\) is also included in the **International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual \(Vol 3\), published by two United Nations organisations** \(International Maritime Organisation; International Civil Aviation Authority\) to  provide a common aviation and maritime approach to search and rescue provision \( **S12**\). According to the International Safety of Life at Sea \(SOLAS\) regulations, all ships are required to carry this publication for use in search and rescue; **this applies to 162 signatory countries, incorporating 99% of the world’s merchant ships by tonnage.**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Brad Beaven’s research findings about citizenship and local patriotism formed the structural basis for exhibitions organised by Portsmouth City Council and the National Museum of the Royal Navy. These formed the centrepieces of their respective First World War centenary commemorations. Drawing on his expertise, these organisations created experiences that reached out to ‘hard to access’ groups, and ‘upskilled’ dozens of citizen researchers. Community and online outreach processes drew thousands of adults and children into workshops on historical research and interpretation. Through this, several hundred people were empowered to make direct, active contributions to the expansion of the source\-base for the exhibitions, transforming the nature of the events for the organisers. Beaven’s expertise on the Battle of Jutland informed the creation of an interactive electronic map, co\-produced with the National Museum of the Royal Navy. This map attracted over 1,000,000 visitors within one month of its launch and inspired citizen researchers from around the world to make contributions to the database.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Beaven, Professor of Social and Cultural History, joined the University of Portsmouth in 1994. His research focuses on the significance of class, gender and empire in British urban popular culture between 1850 and 1945. He has argued through a body of work that a grasp of the changing nature of ‘citizenship’ in these decades is vital to understand the complexity of civic and popular responses to war\-time conditions \(R4\). By 1900, dissemination of messages about the ‘imperial cause’ had visibly altered the expressed direction and essence of ‘good citizenship’, and notions of duty, discipline and sacrifice became key to developing civic politics \(R5\). Thus, by the start of the Boer War, what Beaven has termed ‘local patriotism’ was on the rise, a phenomenon geared to enthusing the populace to embrace the imperial message within a familiar civic context \(R1\). 

 Beaven’s work, most fully developed in *Visions of Empire: Patriotism, Popular Culture and the City, 1870\-1939* \(R2\), identifies the important synergies that grew between a new civic culture of the late nineteenth century and the wider imperial project. The ebb and flow of imperial enthusiasm was shaped by a fusion of local civic pride and a broader imperial identity. That broader culture was neither imposed generically, nor mere background noise, but was instead multi\-layered and recast to capture the concerns of a locality \(R3\). 

 In specific regard to the First World War, the research examined how towns reacted to patriotic calls to enlist, to changing war\-time conditions, and to the growing need to mourn the dead. Civic leaders framed war\-time citizenship and sacrifice in local terms, and Beaven’s work investigated how different social classes and differing generations responded. Portsmouth was one of the 3 key urban case studies in the book. The context of enlistment and the factors which enthused or drove men to enlist formed a substantial part of the Portsmouth City Council ‘Lest We Forget’ exhibition, as discussed below. Another research theme in the book that would prove impactful was to demonstrate how communities responded to heavy personnel losses. Beaven’s research revealed the concerted effort by civic elites and schools to disseminate local role models which enshrined the values of local, national and imperial duty and self\-sacrifice. 

 Continued work on the themes of this research has overlapped with Beaven’s leadership of the Port Towns & Urban Cultures \(PTUC\) research group at the University of Portsmouth. Since 2010, PTUC has made an important contribution to understanding ports as liminal places where urban and marine social and cultural spaces converge. Group members have published numerous articles and an edited volume, *Port Towns and Urban Cultures* \(2016\), and are directing the launch of a new international journal, *Coastal Communities* \(Sage\) in 2021. 

 A key aim of PTUC has been to bridge the gap between cutting\-edge historical investigation and community participation. Thus in 2015 an AHRC\-funded project, ‘Jutland’s National Impact: Civic and Community Responses’, investigated the impact of the 1916 Battle of Jutland on British society through the 6,100 sailors killed in the engagement. The project mapped their homes, and demonstrated that communities across the UK were affected by the battle. The PTUC team collaborated with partners from the Portsdown University of the Third Age \(U3A\), the National Museum of the Royal Navy and a number of student volunteers, producing a permanent public database of their work \(G1 & R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Portsmouth City Council \(PCC\): ‘Lest We Forget’ exhibition, 2014\-15** 

 Beaven’s research, showcased through a previous collaboration with PCC \(a REF2014 ICS\), positioned him as the ideal Guest Curator for this event \(S1\). PCC had evaluated their heritage provision in 2012, and identified that ‘hard to reach’ members of the community \(notably women, the younger generation, and those living in more deprived areas\) rarely visited museum exhibitions. This was thought to be due to perception that such events were dominated by narrow military histories with little genuine connection to present\-day communities. Beaven began work on plans to counter this perception in August 2013, which were successful in attracting GBP110,000 in Heritage Lottery Fund support. 

 Beaven’s research on working\-class communities, patriotism, war and loss not only framed the exhibition’s display content, but also provided the platform for wider community engagement. Research on civic leaders’ strategy of disseminating ‘local patriotism’ through the formation of the ‘Portsmouth Pals’ battalion in 1914 was used to highlight a ‘hidden history’ of the city, and enthused community groups and volunteers to conduct further research on the topic. The physical exhibition ran between June 2014 and January 2015 in the City Museum, and attracted almost 25,000 recorded visitors. In a visitor survey conducted by the Museum, 98% were ‘very satisfied or satisfied’ with the exhibition. In addition, researchers recorded that visitors spent an average of 62 minutes ‘dwell time’ engaging with the exhibits \(S1\), which is almost three times the average benchmarked in a national study \(S3\). 

 Developing community\-based activities to challenge the notion that the Museum was irrelevant for those who lived in more socially disadvantaged districts was a key element of the exhibition strategy. Built around the key insights of Beaven’s research, these were a resounding success. The project recruited and trained 29 volunteers to staff its events and help visitors conduct research in the Museum, and engaged existing community groups who were supported to develop skills in historical investigation and interpreting the past. Almost 50 individuals from five community groups took an active part in contributing in this fashion. To reach out beyond such groups, Beaven led a team of museum professionals and volunteers in running ‘history roadshows’ in ‘hard to reach’ neighbourhoods and communities between 2014 and 2015. Running in three schools, three community centres and the City Library, these attracted 2,274 registered participants \(S2\). 

 Response to these events was overwhelmingly positive. At King Richard’s Secondary School in Paulsgrove, one of Portsmouth’s most deprived areas, teacher Abigail Deadman reported that the pupils *‘really engaged with it’* and that activity had reached beyond the confines of the school and *‘snowballed into a community event’* \(S4\). Beaven’s research on the home front was the foundation for pupils to engage in a variety of activities from initial historical research, to writing and staging a play and film \(S4\). Pupils reported that history was *‘like a real thin*g’ and that they now had a *‘more emotional’* connection to the past \(S4\). 

 Beaven’s material informed workshops on the methods of researching historical sources for everyday life during the War. There was a strong focus on upskilling in research, writing, project management and engaging with digital media; abilities that enhance employability and general well\-being. Participants, who previously had little engagement with the museum and archive services, reported significant benefits. For example, survey respondent ‘Micha’ commented that *‘I became more confident in talking to people and using digital archives. I have improved my research and communication skills’*. ‘Lydia’ noted that *‘I feel more comfortable in a museum environment and have learned what it takes to work in one’*. ‘Kay’ wrote *‘I have enjoyed being in the museum. I feel very connected to the objects and the people. Visitors have become quite emotional when we have done research with them on their relatives’*. Kay’s engagement with the project was the stimulus for her to write a play and become part of the Beddow Library community group \(S2\). 

 These examples of cultural enrichment and ‘citizen research’ generated audio, theatre, film and text which contributed to the Museum gallery and associated website. The website facilitated the opportunity for individuals to ‘upskill’ and become citizen researchers. It allowed participants to listen to Beaven’s podcast on the ‘Portsmouth Pals’, watch videos on ‘how to research’ and upload their own contribution to the project. In total, 55,700 people engaged through digital media \(S2\). 

 Beaven’s material further underpinned an online ‘citizen researcher toolkit’ which advised individuals how to get started on historical research and offered advice and guidelines on how archival research could be conducted \(S5\). The toolkit was downloaded by 111 researchers in a 6 month period \(S2\). The museum greatly benefited, as citizen researchers have so far contributed over 200 additional verified stories to the website. As a permanent component of the Museum’s profile, the website enables the public to engage with Portsmouth’s experience of the First World War, and continues to provide the opportunity to learn how to research archives through the resources it supports \(S6\). 

 **National Museum of the Royal Navy \(NMRN\): Jutland Exhibition, 2016** 

 Beaven’s contribution to the ‘blockbuster’ GBP1,000,000 exhibition on the Battle of Jutland for its centenary year \(S7\) continued and developed the impact achieved in the project above. NMRN leadership identified the crucial value of Beaven’s research, both to highlight the nationwide reach and significance of the battle’s casualties, and to explore and illustrate the impact of such casualties on communities. The database developed by PTUC formed the foundation for the digital map and exhibition. 

 According to \[text removed for publication\], the exhibition curator, *‘Working with the university enabled NMRN to take the Jutland interactive map concept to a whole new level. Something which started life as a limited attempt to try and plot those who died in the battle and came from Portsmouth... became an extraordinarily ambitious national effort to record everyone who took part. This would quite simply have been impossible without the university’s dedicated researchers, and the impressive set of skills and relationships they brought with them’* \(S8\). 

 Beaven’s team and the NMRN co\-produced a new digital map that identified the sailors’ home towns and appealed to the public to contribute stories, photographs, and the names of sailors who survived the battle. This co\-production process itself produced further impactful benefits. Beaven initiated research workshops for volunteers and community groups that enhanced their computer skills in helping them create and use digital maps. This was particularly embraced by the Portsdown University of the Third Age group, who built on their involvement with the City Council exhibition \(above\), and through a series of computer workshops in 2015/16 were enabled to move from basic research to a range of new abilities. They reported that they had *‘developed skills in interpreting archive material’* and learned new skills within the digital humanities through the creation of digital maps. This experience gave them the confidence to successfully bid for their own HLF community project worth over GBP7,900 \(S7\). 

 The Jutland interactive electronic map has had global reach. Its launch attracted significant media coverage, and the site was visited by over 1,000,000 people in its first month of operation \(S9\). It remains in operation, and allows participants to upload stories, photographs and documents to the site. To date, the NMRN has received over 700 additional public contributions to the database, and covers entries from Montreal to Chennai, Islamabad to Istanbul, Savannah, Georgia to Venice, Italy. This resource is now a permanent part of the museum’s collection and outreach resources, and alongside the similar permanent online presence of the City Museum exhibition, ensures that the research of Beaven and PTUC continues to have impact into the future.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Globally, over 340 million children \(including >3 million in the UK\) are overweight or obese. To help parents establish healthy diets in children, Aston and Loughborough Universities have created “The Child Feeding Guide” website and app. The guide is the first interactive resource of its kind and is recommended by services throughout the NHS, is embedded into CPD\-approved training, has been used to educate 670 health care professionals, is incorporated into US policy and has been downloaded by >100,000 users internationally. 

 Impacts on: **Public Policy & Services**; **Practitioners & Delivery of Professional Services** and **Understanding, Learning & Participation** are claimed. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background:** Poor dietary intake in childhood is a significant public health issue; globally 340 million children are overweight or obese and up to 50% of parents in the UK describe their children as fussy eaters at some point. Poor diet and nutrition are related to several chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Fussy eating is also a cause of significant anxiety and stress for many parents. Interventions to improve child diet are not accessible for the majority of families who want help. 

 **Underpinning Research:** Farrow has worked in child nutrition throughout her research career. Since moving to Aston in 2013, she has developed a body of research exploring behaviours around mealtimes that best promote healthy eating behaviour in children and reduce fussy eating.  Farrow’s research \( **S3.1**\) was the first in the world to explore the predictors of observed emotional eating in children over time. Farrow has also piloted a series of interventions with parents to explore the most effective ways to reduce fussy eating, which include both quantitative \( **S3.2**\) and qualitative \( **S3.3**\) studies and subsequently compared their efficacy through home\-based interventions led by parents \( **S3.4**\). Additionally, she has conducted systematic reviews on the development of childrens’ eating behaviour \(e.g. **S3.5**\). 

 Shortly before moving to Aston in 2013, Farrow and colleagues co\-created the first draft of the Child Feeding Guide \(as a website\). Later in 2013, the first iteration of the Child Feeding Guide app was released. Farrow’s research has subsequently informed developments of both the website and the app, including a major website update in 2017, funded by the Higher Education Innovation Fund. 

 **Research Insights/Findings:** Farrow’s pioneering research into emotional eating demonstrated that parents who use overly controlling feeding practices \(such as restricting access to food and using food as a reward for behaviour\) are more likely to have children who eat emotionally two years later. These findings suggest that controlling feeding practices can *teach* children to eat in response to stress and may predict obesogenic eating behaviours in later life. Farrow’s research into fussy eating has also demonstrated that eating with children, eating the same food as them, and not having distractions at mealtimes \(e.g. TV, magazines, toys\) are associated with less fussy child eating behaviour \( **S3.2**\). Farrow and colleagues have brought this research together to develop interventions for families to help support them with fussy eating. Trials of these interventions have shown that the most effective way to help reduce fussy eating in children is to use a combination of a\) simple rewards for tasting new food, b\) parents modelling eating the same food and enjoying it and c\) repeatedly offering the food \( **S3.3, S3.4**\). This research has been integrated into the Child Feeding Guide to provide parents, caregivers and health care professionals with evidence\-based information about child feeding. Most recently the Child Feeding Guide has been evaluated with 25 mothers who used the resource over a period of 4 weeks and reported reduced anxiety and a reduction in the use of overly controlling feeding practices such as pressure to eat which are known to exacerbate feeding problems \( **S3.6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Child Feeding Guide \( **S5.1**\), developed and disseminated by Farrow and colleagues from the body of work detailed in section 3, is the first research\-based app and website of its kind for parents and healthcare professionals which provides evidence\-based, simple advice about how to manage and respond to poor nutrition and fussy eating in children. The following impacts are claimed: 

 **1. Impact on public policy & services: recommendation of the Child Feeding Guide by the NHS:** The Child Feeding Guide is currently the only feeding resource recommended to parents by the NHS as part of their “Information Service for Parents” emails which are sent out to parents/caregivers when infants reach 27 months old \( **S5.2**\). The Child Feeding Guide is also recommended by multiple NHS trusts including CAMHS Hampshire NHS, City and Hackney NHS, Mid Cheshire NHS, South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS, Sandwell & West Birmingham NHS and North East Devon NHS \( **S5.2**\) as a resource for both parents and health care professionals and most recently, is now being recommended by GP groups \(e.g. clmp.org, **S5.2**\) 

 **2. Impact on public policy & services: recommendation of the Child Feeding Guide by national and international charities and organisations:** The Child Feeding Guide has been endorsed and shared by parenting charities including the National Childbirth Trust, Parenting Science Gang and the Indian Educational Foundation Pallikutan \( **S5.3**\). The resource has also been recommended by Rightstart online, toddleabout.co.uk; the Brighton and Hove Food Partnership and by the British Heart Foundation to inform their “Chompy’s Ten Tasty Mealtime Tips” \( **S5.3**\). The Child Feeding Guide is also recommended in multiple, international books concerning child feeding and has been translated by the Early Childhood Eating and Sleeping Disorders Outpatient Clinic at Heim Pal National Institute of Pediatrics, Budapest, Hungary \( **S5.3**\). 

 **3. Impact on public policy & services: international policy development:** Research underpinning the Child Feeding Guide \( **S3.1**\) has been cited in the US Policy Guide: Parenting Matters: Supporting parents of children ages 0\-8 \( **S5.4**\) which was commissioned by the Division of Social and Behavioral Sciences of the US National Academy of Sciences. The National Academies in the US are national authorities in their areas and form the basis for much of US Government policy on health **.** 

 **4. Impact on practitioners and delivery of professional services:** Farrow and colleagues have trained approximately 670 healthcare professionals to understand and apply the research underpinning the Child Feeding Guide. Training has taken place at dedicated events at Aston University, Loughborough University and in London, commissioned by practitioner groups including Startwell \(Birmingham Public Health\) and Riverside Cares which is a leading childcare agency specialising in training and education \( **S5.5**\). Surveys of trainees have revealed that 91% agreed it contains useful information, 87% agreed it is a beneficial resource and 95% said they would recommend the Child Feeding Guide \( **S5.6**\). This Child Feeding Guide training has also been endorsed for CPD by the Association for Nutrition who commented: *“*Many nutritionists’ work involves children, and how to persuade them to eat a healthy diet is important. However, this is an area not generally covered in detail in university nutrition courses, meaning that newly qualified nutritionists often have to learn about this vital area ‘on the job’. The in depth and practical nature of the course will mean that inexperienced nutritionists will be able to acquire a sound and evidence\-based grounding in best practice. *”* \( **S5.7**\). 

 **5. Impact on understanding, learning and participation: parental behaviour and understanding of child eating behavior:** Likely influenced by the recommendations detailed in impacts 1 and 2, well over 100,000 users from 4 continents have viewed >350,000 pages of the Child Feeding Guide. Predominant engagement is from the UK, USA and Australia, but top\-10 usage also encompasses India, the Philippines, France, Pakistan and Singapore \( **S5.8**\). The underpinning research \( **S3.1\-S3.6**\) has been shared internationally by the press and private organisations throughout Europe, US and India \( **S5.9**\). Feedback from parents using the Child Feeding Guide has been overwhelmingly positive. For example: *“*This is a no nonsense super helpful app for everyone who’s ever had a fussy eater at mealtimes. Thanks for the support and the ideas\! *”* \(review from parent user on Apple App Store; **S5.10**\). Questionnaire feedback indicates that more than 80% of parents said that the Child Feeding Guide had helped them to understand their child’s eating behaviour better and feedback from parents also highlights that the Child Feeding Guide has led to positive changes in behaviour around mealtimes: “I think a really important thing is that I’m more relaxed about it now. Before, I was so worried about whether I was doing the right thing I was getting stressed out and probably making things worse. It’s changed my attitude.” \( **S5.10**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Paul Johnson's research on sexual orientation and law has been utilised extensively by legislators and the judiciary to address aspects of discrimination and inequality relating to sexual orientation, and has attracted substantial attention from policymakers, NGOs and the media. This body of research has had a direct impact on: \(1\) the **repeal of statute law** by the UK Parliament relating to homosexuality and the armed forces; \(2\) the **enactment of legislation in the UK Parliament granting disregards and pardons** for historic homosexual offences; \(3\) the **overturning of legislation**, by a landmark judgment of the Supreme Court of Bermuda, that discriminated against same\-sex couples in respect of the adoption of children. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Johnson, through his sociological research, has been drawing attention to sexual orientation discrimination and law since 2007. Through the publication of three monographs and 30 peer\-reviewed journal articles, Johnson has forged a new agenda for asking sociological questions about the relationship between law, aspects of sexual orientation \(such as personal identity, bodily autonomy, and public expression\) and discrimination in the UK, Europe, and the Commonwealth. These questions focus on how the social organization of sexual orientation \(in terms of both the subjective experience of sexual orientation, as well as its manifestations in society\) is shaped by law and, crucially, how law can be utilized to reshape this social organization. As such, Johnson has proposed ways in which legal instruments can be used to, for example, challenge the heteronormative social organization of marriage to achieve marriage equality for same\-sex couples. 

 Johnson’s status as a world leading sociologist of law has been recognized by the award of a Leverhulme Fellowship \(Oct 2015\-Sept 2016; RF\-2015\-105\), which was granted to enable him to undertake the innovative study *Going to Strasbourg: An Oral History of Sexual Orientation Discrimination and the European Convention on Human Rights* **\[E\]**. This monograph combines in\-depth legal research, oral history fieldwork, and sociological analysis, and provides the definitive account of the role that the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\) has played in eradicating discrimination and establishing legal equality on the grounds of sexual orientation in the UK. Johnson has published extensively on sexual orientation and the ECHR **\[A\]\[B\]\[C\]\[E\]** providing sociological analysis of various aspects of ECHR jurisprudence and how it shapes the lives of LGBT in Europe and beyond. 

 Johnson’s work combines rigorous and comprehensive “black letter” analysis of law with sociological analysis. This approach has provided the basis for a sustained track record of socio\-legal research which includes his monograph *Law, Religion and Homosexuality* **\[D\]**. This book explores how religion shapes the making of statute law by the UK Parliament, which regulates the lives of gay men and lesbians, and systematically analyses how sexual orientation equality continues to be restricted by faith\-based beliefs. 

 Johnson’s research has regularly highlighted how discriminatory law within the UK **\[F\]**, Europe and the Commonwealth is made and sustained. Johnson has, for example, shown the influence of the Church of England on the making of legislation that enables discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, the ways in which the Parliament of Uganda sustains discrimination against LGBT people, and how laws in the Russian Federation have been developed to curtail expression of non\-heterosexual sexual orientation in the public sphere. 

 Johnson is recognized as a leading expert on sexual orientation discrimination and law. Evidence of this is Johnson’s invited Third Annual Belfast Pride Law Lecture on 1st August 2019 at Queen's University.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  <ins>\(1\) Armed Forces</ins> 

 In October 2015, Johnson submitted evidence \(arising from research in **\[D\]**\) to the UK Parliament’s Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill asking its members to introduce an amendment to the Armed Forces Bill 2015/16 to repeal two sections of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which made provision for a member of Her Majesty’s armed forces to be discharged for engaging in a “homosexual act” **\[1a\]**. The Select Committee gave extensive consideration to the submission and questioned a wide range of witnesses on it, including General Sir Nick Carter \(Chief of the General Staff\), who were asked their *“view on Professor Johnson’s proposals to repeal sections \[in\] the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, under which it is possible to dismiss a person from the armed forces for homosexual acts”* **\[1b\]**. At Report stage of the Bill in the House of Commons, the Government introduced an amendment that met the request made in Johnson’s submission **\[1c\]**. In doing so, the Minister thanked Johnson *“for raising this important issue in \[his\] evidence to the Bill’s Select Committee”* **\[1c\]**. The amendment was agreed and enacted as Armed Forces Act 2016, s 14. 

 The significance of the repeal is that it removes from statute law discriminatory provisions relating to homosexuality and the armed forces. A wide range of MPs and Peers in the House of Lords agreed with the agenda set by Johnson and were in support of the repeal **\[1c\]\[1d\]**. For example, as Kirsten Oswald MP put it: *“It is scarcely credible that we are discussing this in 2016. The existing provision is discriminatory and it is offensive that it exists … \[W\]e welcome the fact that the Government are finally removing the provision, as they should, because it has clearly infringed the rights of LGBT people over a number of years”* **\[1c\]**. 

###  <ins>\(2\) Disregards and pardons</ins> 

 In 2016, Johnson’s work \(with Vanderbeck **\[D\]**\) led to significant changes in respect of the legislation providing the so\-called “Turing Pardons” to people previously convicted of “homosexual offences”. Johnson’s work underpinned provisions in the Policing and Crime Act 2017 that: 

1.  provide living persons convicted of or cautioned for certain now abolished offences in Northern Ireland with the ability to apply to have a conviction or caution disregarded and, if successful, to be pardoned for any offence; 

1.  provide posthumous pardons for those deceased persons convicted of or cautioned for now abolished offences in Northern Ireland; 

1.  provide a power for regulations to be made \(in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland\) to extend the disregard scheme in the future to enable those convicted of or cautioned for other “homophobic” offences to have a conviction or caution disregarded and, if successful, to be pardoned for any offence; 

1.  ensure that those convicted of certain abolished offences under service law are eligible to receive posthumous pardons in the same way as those convicted under civil law. 

 These provisions, underpinned by Johnson’s research on the historical criminalization of same\-sex sexual acts **\[D\]**, which gained widespread attention, are of considerable significance in providing redress to those persons who, over several centuries, suffered state\-sponsored persecution on the basis of their sexual orientation. 

####  Northern Ireland pardons and disregards 

 In October 2016, based on his wider research **\[D\]\[E\]**, Johnson drafted amendments to the Policing and Crime Bill to make provision to grant pardons for those convicted of or cautioned for “homosexual offences” in Northern Ireland, and to extend to Northern Ireland the “disregard scheme” in respect of such offences that had been operating in England and Wales by virtue of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. These amendments were tabled in the House of Lords by Lord Lexden on 25 October 2016 **\[2a\]**, debated on 9 November 2016 in Committee of the Whole House **\[2b\]**, and agreed \(in revised form\) on 12 December 2016 **\[2c\]**. Lord Lexden stated: *“It is his \[Johnson’s\] work \[...\] that will now confer on gay people in Northern Ireland the equal rights arising from this major reform, which they want and deserve”* **\[2c\]**. The agreed amendments were enacted as Policing and Crime Act 2017, ss 168\-71. As part of this process Johnson liaised extensively with the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland, providing them with expert advice on the “age of consent”. 

####  Extension of disregard scheme 

 In October 2016, Johnson drafted amendments to the Policing and Crime Bill to, *inter alia*, make provision to extend the “disregard scheme” \(as described above\) to include the offence of “solicitation by men”. These amendments were tabled in the House of Lords by Lord Cashman on 7 November 2016 **\[2d\]** and debated in Committee of the Whole House on 9 November 2016 during which, in respect of one amendment, Baroness Williams \(Minister of State, Home Office\) stated that she was willing to meet with Johnson and Lord Cashman to discuss the matter further **\[2e\]**. For that meeting, Johnson provided the Minister with a written “expert opinion” **\[2f\]**. As a consequence of these discussions, Lord Cashman re\-tabled a revised amendment, supported by the Government, to make provision to enable the Home Secretary to exercise a power to create regulations that extend the disregard scheme to include, *inter alia*, the offence of “solicitation by men” **\[2g\]**. On moving the amendment, Lord Cashman said that Johnson’s work was “ *invaluable in shaping our approach*” **\[2g\]**. The agreed amendment was enacted as Policing and Crime Act 2017 s 166. 

####  Service \(military\) offences 

 In December 2016, Johnson identified a significant flaw in a provision in the Policing and Crime Bill which concerned posthumous pardons for those convicted of certain repealed offences under service \(military\) law. Johnson pointed out that the Bill would, if enacted, grant pardons only to those convicted as far back as 1866 and that this was inadequate because same\-sex sexual acts had been criminalized by service law as far back as 1661. Johnson’s point was raised by Lord Lexden in the House of Lords **\[2h\]** and, consequently, the Government tabled amendments \(based on research by Johnson, subsequently published in Johnson **\[F\]**\) that extended posthumous pardons to those convicted under Naval law from 1661 onwards **\[2i\]**, which were debated and accepted on 19 December 2016 **\[2j\].** This was enacted as Policing and Crime Act 2017 s 164. Johnson raised the further concern that equivalent provisions had not been included in respect of the Army and Royal Marines and subsequently wrote a Private Member’s Bill for Lord Cashman to address these outstanding pardons which received its First Reading on 23 October 2019 **\[2k\]**. 

###  <ins>\(3\) Supreme Court of Bermuda</ins> 

 Johnson’s research **\[A\]** was cited in a landmark judgment issued by the Supreme Court of Bermuda \(SCB\). In *A. and B. v Director of Child and Family Services and Attorney General* **\[3\]**, the SCB found in favour of a same\-sex couple who complained that their inability to jointly adopt a child, who they had been raising together, constituted unlawful discrimination. Under Bermuda law, the couple could not jointly adopt the child because joint adoption was available only to married couples \(and, at that time, same\-sex couples could not marry in Bermuda\). Hellman J held that denying the couple the opportunity to make a joint application amounted to direct discrimination against unmarried couples because of their marital status, and indirect discrimination against same\-sex couples because of their sexual orientation. In concluding that the prohibition on adoption by unmarried couples was not justifiable, Hellman J *“decline\[d\] to follow the reasoning”* **\[3,** para 32 **\]** of the European Court of Human Rights \(ECtHR\) in *Gas and Dubois v France* \(judgment of 2012\) *.* In reaching this decision, and rejecting the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, Hellman J cited Johnson’s “trenchant criticism” of the *Gas and Dubois* judgment **\[3,** para 35 **\]**, quoting Johnson’s socio\-legal analysis that the ECtHR’s approach to this issue *“will strike many people as perverse or obtuse”* **\[A\]**. As a result of the judgment of the SCB, a joint application to adopt a child could be made by a same\-sex couple. 

 The landmark judgment of the SCB in *A. and B.* was very significant in ending one aspect of discrimination against same\-sex couples in Bermuda. It produced the direct outcome that *“a joint application to adopt a child may be made by an unmarried couple, whether same\-sex or different\-sex”* **\[3,** para 43 **\]**. However, its significance extends beyond Bermuda and will potentially impact on same\-sex couples across 47 member states of the Council of Europe. This is because Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory within the ECHR system and, in declining to follow the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, the SCB has presented a significant challenge to the ECtHR’s approach when considering complaints about discrimination by same\-sex couples who are denied access to marriage and its rights and benefits.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Zooniverse is a citizen scientist platform underpinned by research from Oxford Physics that has engaged over 2,100,000 registered volunteers in 248 projects over a broad range of topics, including the arts, biology, climate, history, language, literature, medicine, nature, physics, social science, astronomy and astrophysics. The benefits that have arisen from the different projects made possible by the Zooniverse include: improved disaster relief response, where volunteers on the Planetary Response Network project have provided rapid and responsive analysis of satellite imagery; changes to environmental policy, where the boundaries of Marine Protected Areas have been redefined as a result of improved penguin population data from the Penguin Watch project; enhanced teaching in schools via programmes such as ZooTeach, which has engaged school children in the Bash the Bug and Plastic Tide Projects; and benefits to the well\-being and engagement of the citizen scientists involved in the Planet Hunters project.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Zooniverse has its origins in the Galaxy Zoo project, pioneered by Prof Chris Lintott at Oxford Physics, which aimed to involve citizen scientists \(CSs\) in the morphological classification of galaxies, which is best done by the human eye. Millions of potentially interesting astronomical objects are sampled by ground and space\-based platforms such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Hubble Space Telescope, and therefore a sustainable solution was needed to analyse this volume of data. In 2008, work led and conducted by Oxford Physics showed that newly developed software allowed access to a large audience, and that their classifications could be combined to produce a consensus. CSs were asked to classify galaxies into 6 different morphological categories. Accurate measurement of morphology encodes the system’s history and can be correlated with other physical parameters. \[1\] showed that CSs could perform classifications with sufficient accuracy \(when cross referenced with each other\) that the data could be used in scientific research. Further work published in 2011 \(substantially carried out in Oxford, in collaboration with the Adler Planetarium, Yale, Nottingham, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Portsmouth, Johns Hopkins, LinkLab and Fingerprint Digital Media\) developed new techniques to measure subtle biases inherent in classification, and thus present measures of classification accuracy which have proved generally useful as a methodology for producing results from CS projects \[2\], used, for example, in \[3\]. 

 New astronomical projects including the Vera Rubin Observatory’s LSST survey will continue the trend to larger and larger surveys, producing 30TB of images and 10,000,000 transient alerts each night. This growth, in combination with a desire not to waste volunteers’ time, has led to the development of more sophisticated algorithms for both task assignment and developing consensus. Published in 2016 \[3\], work jointly led by Oxford Physics \(design and leadership of the study, plus management of Zooniverse project development\), the University of Tokyo, and Stanford, used CS classifications as part of the first Space Warps lens search, and demonstrated that better weighting of volunteers’ abilities could increase lens detection rates from 65% to 80%. This was the first large project to offer significant increases in efficiency in this way. The combination of human and machine classifications was explored by an Oxford\-led collaboration \(with Queen’s Belfast, Minnesota, Northwestern, the Adler Planetarium, University of Hawaii and UCSD\), in the search for supernovae in data from Pan\-STARRS1. They showed that a combination of human and machine classifications allowed for near real\-time discovery, and outperformed either method used individually \[4\]. A recent Oxford\-led study \(designed and guided by Lintott, who also co\-led interpretation of the results with Smethurst\) examined the use of Bayesian convolutional neural networks \(CNN\) for active learning in a human/machine hybrid system \[5\]. Bayesian CNN, trained on data from Galaxy Zoo, predict the probability distribution for a given morphological feature; the network correctly interprets the uncertainty in volunteer labels, and can be used to select those images where an active learning strategy will most improve the network. This combination of machine and human intelligence reduces the time taken to classify surveys from years \(with CS classifications alone\) to weeks, and is now deployed on the live Galaxy Zoo site. These early projects \(Galaxy Zoo and Space Warps are representative examples\) have acted as research projects in how to design effective astronomical citizen science and have provided the basis for how such tasks should be designed for other applications.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 As a direct result of the research described above in building projects such as Galaxy Zoo and Space Warps \[1\]\-\[5\], the Zooniverse Project Builder was released in July 2015, which has allowed users to deploy their own projects, without requiring involvement of Zooniverse staff. This has facilitated a huge expansion of the platform. The Zooniverse has supported 248 projects \(of which 92 are currently active\) over a broad range of topics, including the arts, biology, climate, history, language, literature, medicine, nature, physics, social science and space. More than 2,100,000 volunteers are registered on the site. Here we detail the impact of the suite of Zooniverse projects that have been launched and sustained in the REF period. The site was especially busy in the period of lockdown in 2020; from March\-May more than 40,000,000 classifications were received from volunteers \(compared with 19,000,000 in March\-May 2019\), illustrating the appeal of participation in this sort of community science to its volunteers. Many of these projects involve researchers and datasets from other institutions, but the underpinning research and expertise in citizen science as a scientific tool, along with the leadership, development and implementation, is an Oxford\-led endeavour. We use a few individual Oxford\-led projects to illustrate the type of impacts achieved. 

###  Fast satellite imagery analysis resulting in improved disaster relief 

 The <ins>Planetary Response Network</ins> project \(PRN\) was first field tested in 2014 and is led by Brooke Simmons \(Oxford Physics until 2015, now Lancaster University\) in collaboration with the Oxford Physics Zooniverse team, disaster relief agency Rescue Global and the Oxford Machine Learning Research Group. It allows CSs to analyse satellite images of areas affected by natural disasters in the hours following the disaster, aiding rescue workers on the ground; the requirement for rapid results is only achievable using the tools for efficient task assignment and analysis that were developed as a result of the research described in \[1\]\-\[5\]. Volunteer analysis identifies sites with structural damage to buildings or roads or with flooding, information is then used to update maps used by disaster response teams. The Network has been mobilised several times in response to natural disasters; here we describe its use for Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, when over 5,000 volunteers performed satellite imagery classification effort which would have taken an expert 8 months in just 3 weeks. Irma struck first in early September, causing catastrophic damage in the north eastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys, and killing at least 134 people. The first satellite image set \(of Guadeloupe\) was classified in just 2 hours, allowing damage maps to be sent to Rescue Global from the first day of the project; Rescue Global also shared the maps publicly with other NGOs in the region, including S.A.R.A.I.D. According to a report from Rescue Global \(19<sup>th</sup> September 2017\): “ *SARAID used building damage heat maps \[of Turks and Caicos Islands\] generated by the Zooniverse platform to target priority areas for building damage assessments. 22 buildings were evaluated by the SARAID team including: 3 evacuation shelters, 1 hospital, 1 clinic, 3 schools and 1 government office.*” The maps directly benefitted rescue efforts in St Thomas: “ *In addition to supplying an NGO with satellite communications on St Thomas island, the team also evacuated a small number of patients with critical healthcare needs \(including a pregnant lady\) to San Juan. Both missions were aided by the heat maps.*” **\[A\]** The flexibility of the Zooniverse interface, in combination with an improved understanding of how best to use volunteers’ time efficiently \(studies \[3\-5\]\) allowed the PRN team to optimise the use of citizen science tools in real time, and to adjust the priority of what was needed as the situation developed. Hurricane Maria struck just two weeks later, and was regarded as the worst natural disaster in recorded history to affect Dominica and Puerto Rico; the official estimated death toll was 2,975 over the entire affected region. Initially volunteer effort was directed to analysis of satellite imagery from Dominica \(as Puerto Rico was covered by cloud\), and even before the first heat maps were produced, volunteers had reported damage to an airport, which was directly shared with Rescue Global, who included a specific assessment of the airfield in their aerial surveys. **\[B\]** When cloud coverage precluded early damage assessment, volunteers were tasked with producing estimates of building density from pre\-disaster images, to improve out\-of\-date census information. Working with partner NGO DART International UK, Rescue Global used the maps of road blockages to more rapidly enable the efforts to clear fallen trees and debris in order to restore critical national infrastructure and gain awareness of accessible locations in which to work. Their Operational Manager commented: “ *The maps are continuing to be a really \(really\!\) helpful component of our intelligence gathering, especially as the teams have been travelling around Dominica. Information regarding observed concentrations of settlements, road blockages, structural damage and building damage proportions especially, were particularly crucial as they mapped their way around the more isolated communities and health centres. The fact that we are flying regularly between a number of islands, means that ALL of the maps are proving very useful, and those that we are now further from are proving useful for other organisations concentrating in those areas.*” **\[A\]** 

###  Changes to Marine Protected Areas as a result of improved wildlife census 

 Zooniverse hosts a large array of projects that study the effects of human society on the natural world, to inform policy. These include more than 50 ecology camera\-trap projects, which aim to study endangered wildlife and improve their protection; 8 projects that ask CSs to digitize historical climate records and specimens to improve our understanding of long\-term climate change; and several projects that track changes in flora, and how these are markers for climate change. The <ins>Penguin Watch</ins> project asks volunteers \(more than 1,000,000 have taken part\) to count penguins in images and time\-lapse footage captured by remote cameras, satellites, aircraft and drones, and is led by Tom Hart in the Oxford Zoology department. Penguin Watch, built by the team in Physics working with the zoologists, uses the same underlying platform code that was developed as a result of \[1\]\-\[5\]; this code has allowed a very large amount of data to be analysed, and provided confidence in the results. Overall, the project monitors more penguin nesting sites than all of the Antarctic Treaty Nations put together, and uses these data to inform discussions on the boundaries of Marine Protected Areas. The South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area \(SGSSI MPA\) was established in 2012 to protect and conserve the region’s rich and diverse marine life, and is one of the world’s largest sustainably managed MPAs. In May 2019, following a review, legislation was passed to expand the no\-take zones to cover 23% of the MPA, a measure that is expected to greatly enhance the protection and conservation of the Territory’s rich marine biodiversity. **\[C\]** This review was informed by published research from the Penguin Watch project, and by an in\-person presentation from Tom Hart at the June 2018 Review Workshop and subsequent discussion **\[D\]**. A testimonial from the Director of Fisheries and Environment of the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands states: “On the basis of the evidence provided, which was derived from analyses of both tracking devices fitted to penguins and from remote camera data, GSGSSI considered his recommendation to extend the ‘No Take Zone’ \(NTZ\) around the South Sandwich Islands. This advice included extending the NTZ from 3km out to 50km in order to reduce the potential for competition for food resources between the region’s krill fisheries and penguin populations. The rationale behind the extension was to encompass the foraging range of the penguin species in the region as determined by Dr Hart and colleagues’ recent research *.*” **\[E\]** 

###  Improved understanding, engagement and well\-being of citizen scientists 

 The Zooniverse achieves broad reach, with 2,100,000 registered volunteers. A 2016 study showed that participation in online citizen science increased users’ scientific knowledge **\[G\]**. A representative recent \(June 2019\) survey was conducted of users of the <ins>Planet Hunters</ins> project \(a long\-standing project, led by Suzanne Aigrain in Oxford, with 13,000 volunteers\), where 577 individuals responded to a questionnaire **\[H\]**. The data showed that participants came from 56 different countries \(with 42% from Europe, 38% from North America and 8% from Australia and New Zealand\); 30% had not been enrolled in higher education; 30% had no background in science; 75% were male; a range of ages were included, from under 18s \(8%\) to over 75s \(5%\), with 55\-64 the most common age bracket \(19%\). 88% of those surveyed rated their experience of Planet Hunters as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’, with 66% engaging because they enjoyed learning about astronomy and 89% because they wanted to contribute to scientific research. 73% reported that they had learnt something through the project. Quotes from the survey reveal impacts on: <ins>Pursuit of knowledge beyond the project</ins>: “ *It was the starting point for learning most of what I know today about space telescopes and stellar astronomy*.”, “ *I have joined an Astronomy club and even took part in IASC Asteroid Search Campaign*”; <ins>Well\-being</ins>: “ *Zooniverse has been a big factor in making my retirement fun and meaningful*”, “ *I owe a lot to planet hunters I have a bad injury to my hand and anxiety so it is a huge help to my recovery*”; <ins>Community</ins>: “ *friendship with other volunteers*”, “ *closer to son and grandson who are also interested*”, “ *networking with my friends who also volunteer*”; <ins>Widening access</ins>: “ *I have a love and long term interest in science but never been able to afford things like uni or degrees and was never able to pursue it… so this sort of thing is great.*”, “ *I am mad about science I am self educated and never in a million years did I think I could contribute anything to science*”, “ *I dreamed of becoming an astronomer in my youth… it brought me closer to my dream*”. In a large survey on volunteers across the Zooniverse carried out in April and May 2020, more than two thirds of volunteers said they had sought out new ways to learn about scientific topics, and more than half had taken part in other science\-related activities. More than 70% said they would do so in the future. 

###  Inspiring and informing school children and their teachers 

 Zooniverse offers dedicated resources for educators to share materials that complement the use of Zooniverse projects in schools. Resources are organised by subject area and age level. A recent pilot project to bring project\-specific workshops to schools was run in 10 primary schools in South\-East England between October 2018 and February 2019, attended by 558 pupils. 8 of the schools were state schools, of which 6 had an Ofsted rating of ‘Good’, while 4 schools had between 21% and 37% of their pupils receiving the pupil premium. Two hour\-long workshops were created based on the <ins>Bash the Bug</ins> and <ins>Plastic Tide</ins> projects, aimed at year 5 and 6 pupils. Questionnaires conducted after the workshops showed **\[L\]** that approximately 90% of pupils thought the workshops were enjoyable, and 85% and 67% of students wanted to do more to tackle plastic waste, or find new medicines, respectively.  Approximately 80% agreed that they had learnt something new, with the main learning outcomes of the Plastic Tide workshop being that plastic waste is harmful, and that it is widespread; and of the Bash the Bug session being that bugs are becoming resistant to medicines, not all bugs are harmful, and antibiotics can’t cure all diseases. They also learnt that scientists are helping to save the planet \(20%\), don’t only work in labs \(17%\) and everyone can be one \(10%\). Feedback from the teachers was overwhelmingly positive, both in terms of the effect on pupils: “ *It really inspired them in terms of they can do something really valid … they can do something useful*”, *“\[Being a scientist\] is a real job you could do. You could fly drones … my pupils didn’t know that before, that scientists do that*”, *“\[the workshop\] brought it to life. They could actually really see it happen in our world*” and on their own professional practice: “ *Interesting to see a completely new way of teaching science. I definitely think it’s something I want to use going forward*”, “ *There are certain bits of that approach I will take on myself*”. **\[L\]** 

###  Inspiring new forms of artistic expression and enhancing museum exhibitions 

 The Zooniverse has inspired a unique digital art project ‘We Need Us’ which is a live, online, animated artwork that is generated from Zooniverse metadata. **\[J\]** It was commissioned by The Space and the Open Data Institute in 2014, and then recommissioned by the NEoN \(North East of North\) Digital Art Festival. The Adler Planetarium \(partners in the Zooniverse\) was the first planetarium in the United States and attracts more than 500,000 visitors a year. It has numerous exhibits that relate to active Zooniverse projects and encourages visitors to the museum to get involved on site via Wi\-Fi, and via a dedicated exhibit on the museum floor. **\[K\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Britain’s seaside communities have been characterised as shabby and outdated and, as recognised by the House of Lords Select Committee on Regenerating Seaside Towns and Communities \(2019\), been seen ‘as a sort of national embarrassment’. Shepherdson and Ball use seaside photography to challenge that perception. Their work has contributed to the preservation and re\-evaluation of an overlooked part of our photographic heritage, and uses photography to develop a more nuanced narrative of our seaside communities. Research has resulted in: 

-  Preservation of seaside photographic heritage, via community collaboration to develop the South East Archive of Seaside \(SEAS\) Photography, including the protection and digitisation of over 10,000 historic seaside photographs; 

-  Enrichment of cultural life by enhancing presentation and interpretation of seaside photography; including for Turner Contemporary’s first photography exhibition *Seaside: Photographed* \(2019\); 

-  Improved understanding by challenging perceptions and raising the profile of coastal heritage and communities; 

-  Increased cultural engagement leading to enhanced confidence and self\-esteem.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Impact is underpinned by collaborative archival, curatorial and practice\-based research by Ball and Shepherdson concerned with seaside photographic heritage, and the use of photography to recalibrate perceptions of seaside culture and communities. Britain’s once prosperous coastal resorts now contain some of the UK’s most disadvantaged communities, and media coverage of these towns over past decades has been ‘almost unremittingly negative’ \(Coastal Communities Alliance\). Shepherdson and Ball use photography to develop a more nuanced narrative of coastal heritage and contemporary culture. 

 Research began in 2012 with the development of SEAS Photography \(Shepherdson/Ball\), established not only to preserve and increase access to at\-risk photographic seaside heritage, but also as a hub for research projects. Initially supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund \(£75,200\), over 10,000 photographs have been preserved and documented. The archive includes the Sunbeam Photographic Company collection, based on the Isle of Thanet \(1919\-1975\); the largest known collection of early \(1850\-1910\) seaside ambro and ferrotypes; and a significant collection of ‘walkies’ \(images taken by seaside commercial photographers and available almost instantly\). ‘Walkies’ were considered unworthy of archiving at the time and were primarily located by the research team through public calls, with the owners participating in their preservation and documentation. Through development and interpretation of the archive and the creation of new photographic seaside imagery, three interconnected areas of enquiry have emerged: \(1\) A reappraisal of seaside photographic practice; \(2\) The location of seaside photography within broader social and cultural histories; \(3\) New perspectives on the culture and heritage of coastal communities. 

 The exhibition and publication *Beyond the View: Reframing the Sunbeam Photographic Collection* \(Shepherdson/Ball\) **\[3.1\]** considered the work of early commercial seaside photographers \(1850\-1900\), utilising the SEAS holdings, including over 500 located ‘walkies’. Early beach photographers were itinerant, and their work often dismissed as inartistic and disposable; research revealed the considerable creativity and technical skill involved in making these images and established their contribution to British photographic history. It also demonstrated how seaside photography brought insights into broader social histories of leisure and reflected wider society. The beach photographer represented an affordable alternative to studio portraiture, documenting the leisure time of individuals whose image might otherwise not have been captured. Via interpretation of these images, material shifts in portraiture were revealed, reflecting the changing social landscape of the second half of the 19th C. These themes were further considered in the online exhibition *Beyond the View: Reframing Early Seaside Photography* \(2015\) for the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(Shepherdson\) and book chapter of the same title **\[3.1\]**. 

 *Seaside: Photographed* \(2019\) explored the relationship between photographers and the British coast and its communities and visitors, from the 1850s to the present day. By examining the complexities of family life, relationships, leisure, and counterculture, as portrayed by images captured at the coast, it demonstrated how the British seaside has been used, photographically, as metaphor for the state of the nation **\[3.2\]**. Curated by Shepherdson with Professor Val Williams \(University of the Arts London\), it featured images from SEAS, alongside work of eminent photographers and artists including Vanley Burke, Susan Hillier, Jane Bown, Anna Fox, Henri Cartier Bresson and Paul Nash. It also, crucially, included works from previous unknown photographers or archives, located through a public call, redressing the critical neglect of amateur photography and creating a more complex and layered narrative of coastal life as reflected in seaside photographic practice. 

 The role of photography in recalibrating perceptions of the British seaside and its communities is reflected in both *Beyond the View* **\[3.1\]** and *Seaside: Photographed* **\[3.2\]**. *Beyond the View* revealed a seam of overlooked imagery, which provided a window into coastal culture and history; while *Seaside: Photographed* critically examined seaside descriptors of decline and regeneration by interrogating the romanticism and beauty of the coast, in contrast to the often difficult realities faced by those who live there. This is complemented by the creation of new photographic work which further considers photography’s reinterpretation of coastal communities and places. *Dreamlands* \(Ball\) **\[3.3\]** examines the history of coastal entertainment, foregrounding the cyclical nature of neglect and repair within seaside communities through a series of ferrotypes \( *Dreamlands*, 2015; *Coney Island*, 2017; *Funlands*, 2019\). *Dreamlands* positions ‘regeneration’ as reparation, locating it within the broader historical and social narratives of the ebb and flow of coastal resorts. Ball’s *The Itinerant* \(2017\) **\[3.4\]**, a reworking of the travelling portrait photographer, examines the craft of traditional process in a contemporary context and the exchange between the photographer, sitter and viewer. Coastal public events are held producing ferrotypes in a mobile darkroom. The resultant images are displayed outside the mobile studio during the events, and in exhibitions and publications subsequently, creating a contemporary archive of coastal photography.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Via community collaboration, work with cultural institutions and media engagement, Shepherdson and Ball’s critical engagement with seaside photography has been to the benefit of coastal communities, including their cultural institutions, community organisations, volunteers, and young people. It has resulted in the preservation of, and increased access to, marginalised and forgotten seaside photographic heritage; presentation and interpretation of seaside photography; a challenge to perceptions of contemporary coastal communities; and increased cultural participation leading to enhanced confidence and self\-esteem. 

 **Impact on community heritage via community collaboration to develop the South East Archive of Seaside \(SEAS\) Photography**. A digitised archive of over 10,000 historic seaside photographs \(4,977 images since Aug 2013\) has been created, many of which had existed as deteriorating glass and film negatives. SEAS offered a last chance to save the photographs of the Sunbeam Collection. Martin Parr, Patron of SEAS, said of the *Beyond the View* \(2014\) exhibition: ‘At its core is the wonderful Sunbeam Collection, which has been rescued for the Nation by SEAS \[...\] in the exhibition we have a glimpse of the richness and variety of the work that is part of this archive’. **\[5.1\]** Community focused from the outset, SEAS was established in partnership with stakeholders, including Thanet District Council, Margate Museum, and a group of volunteers who cleaned and digitized the images and acted as ambassadors. Volunteers’ comments on the benefits of involvement include: ‘I am completely drawn into the archive’s time, place and stories \[…\] I get more out than I ever put in’ and ‘I feel so proud to be part of this Project.’ **\[5.2\]**. Further increasing community collaboration, open calls were made to locate over 500 ‘walkies’ which were ‘hidden’ in family albums. At community collection events, owners participated in the preservation and documentation of their images, which were scanned, attributed, catalogued, and finally exhibited as part of *Beyond the View*. 

 **Impact on cultural life by enhancing the presentation and interpretation of seaside photography.** The *Beyond the View* exhibition attracted an estimated 1,500 visitors **\[5.2\]** and featured in the Financial Times \(FT\) Weekend Magazine \(Jul 2014\) who highlighted the personal relevance of the images. ‘Surely one of the reasons we love poring over old family snapshots like these is because, along with the past, they’re often where we see the earliest incarnations of the people we’ve become’ \(circulation 2014: approx. 720,000\) **\[5.3\]**. Visitors’ comments evidence the personal resonance of the imagery and its relevance to social history, including: ‘Wonderful pictures of ordinary people going about their ordinary lives’; ‘these images are interesting – emotionally, as social documentary, as photographs. Equals looking at equals’; and ‘\[s\]o many local people and self and family\!’ and ‘that’s how the seaside was. Lovely memories’ **\[5.2\]**. 

 For *Seaside: Photographed* \(2019\), Shepherdson and Williams appealed to the public for archive material and personal photographs. Key ‘finds’ included Raymond Conrad Lawson’s 1950s colour documentation of family gatherings and Pat Gwynne’s domestic pictures c. 1965\-1975, both demonstrating the importance of amateur photographers in documenting family life on the coast. *Seaside: Photographed* was Turner Contemporary’s first photographic show and its Director, Victoria Pomery, highlights its uncovering of ‘rich and sometimes unknown work from across photography’s history’ and notes that exhibition’s popularity with audiences, attracting 159,083 visitors **\[5.4a\]**. Sarah Martin, Turner Contemporary’s Head of Exhibitions, also draws attention to the exhibition’s showing of ‘a different, less obvious aspect of seaside life’ **\[5.4b\]**. Critical reception was extremely positive, with reviews commenting on the revealing of new imagery and contemporary reinterpretation. Giving it 5 stars in The Observer, Laura Cumming wrote, ‘\[n\]ot the least pleasure of this tremendous show \[…\] is the sheer rush of revelation’. In a 5 star review in Inews, Hettie Judah highlights how the curators had presented the coast ‘as sites of complex and multiple identities’. She continues ‘this is not run\-of\-the\-mill stuff for exhibitions. \[…\] Williams and Shepherdson’s interest in photography does not just extend to the images themselves, but beyond, to the context in which they were made and presented’ with the subject being ‘permitted quite astonishing complexity’ **\[5.3\].** Turner Contemporary received an Arts Council England \(GBP 223,725\) grant to tour three additional seaside venues \(Grundy Art Gallery, Blackpool; Newlyn Art Galley; and John Hansard Gallery, Southampton\). The Grundy and Newlyn shows were postponed until 2021 due to Covid\-19. The Southampton exhibition opened in October 2020, just before the 2nd lockdown, and later translated to an online show **\[5.4a\]**. 

 **Impact on understanding by challenging perceptions and raising the profile of coastal heritage and communities.** SEAS is underpinned by a desire to offer a more nuanced narrative of coastal communities past and present. One way in which this is achieved is the attraction of a broad spectrum of media coverage and work to extend appreciation of coastal heritage. Ball’s *Dreamlands* was commissioned by The Dreamland Trust, a charity born out of the Save Dreamland Campaign, with the aim of saving the UK’s oldest amusement park from redevelopment and preserving its heritage. Images from *Dreamlands* accompanied features on the park and its reopening \(in 2015\) on the BBC website, The Guardian and the FT Magazine, who writes how Ball’s images ‘echo the broader repairs going on around him’ **\[5.3\]**. *Dreamlands* was also the subject of an exhibition at the Photographers’ Gallery \(2015\), with an estimated 32,000 individuals visiting the gallery during the show’s run. The potential of photography to positively engage audiences with Margate’s heritage was recognised by The Dreamland Trust’s Heritage and Engagement Manager, Jan Leandro. Leandro comments on how photography was used to build an understanding and appreciation of the park’s heritage, with Ball’s ‘beautifully atmospheric tintype images’ being ‘the perfect vehicle for this, they appear to be of the past but are created in the present and connect the contemporary with the historic, leading the viewer back in time.’ **\[5.5\]** 

 Reviews of Ball’s *Funland* \(part of his *Dreamlands* series\) reflect on the charm and nostalgia of seaside resorts. Tatler writes how the images captured ‘coastal towns in their faded splendour \[…\] \[n\]uanced and nostalgic, these pictures capture today’s seaside summers with sympathy’; Creative Boom noted the ‘sense of nostalgia and vulnerability’ in the images, and Creative Review wrote how they captured the ‘sleepy spirit of the British Seaside’ \(all 2019\). Additionally, a picture feature on *Funland* was published in The Observer and on The Guardian website. *Seaside: Photographed* coverage includes the FT Magazine, The Guardian, Wall Street International Magazine, The Telegraph and Inews. Richard Holledge’s piece in The New European, ‘Rollercoaster ride: The rise and fall and recent recovery of Britain’s seaside towns’, gives an example of coverage highlighting the ebbs and flows of coastal culture **\[5.3\]**. Images from SEAS was utilised in the development of projects by architect Sam Causer and the Vividero Colectivo, resulting in the outdoor exhibitions/events *Blushing Pavilion* \(2015\) and *Margate Coastal Park* \(2016\), which highlighted the value of Margate’s heritage and culture. Carlos Maria Romero \(Vividero Colectivio\) writes how the archive was ‘fundamental’ to the success of the projects, informing development and featuring in the final works. *Blushing Pavilion* featured in the Architecture Foundation’s publication *New Architects 3* \(2016\), launched in the British Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale **\[5.6\].** 

 **Impact on cultural participation via the use of heritage as a catalyst for increased cultural engagement leading to enhanced confidence and self\-esteem.** The Heritage Lottery funded *Projection SEAS* \(GBP49,600\) was created by social enterprise Project Motorhouse, in partnership with SEAS. Students from the Royal Harbour Academy, Ramsgate learned about digitising images and chose an image from the archive as a catalyst for their artwork. The result was 3 exhibitions of photographic work, including a pop\-up at the Turner Contemporary and on hoardings on Ramsgate Main Sands. For participants, many excluded from school, involvement in the project was a ‘life\-changing event’ and for most was one of their ‘rare successes in life’ **\[5.7a\]**. Jo Mapp, Community Engagement Officer, Project Motorhouse commented on the benefits of the project noted how ‘people who were shy, they have absolutely just blossomed’ **\[5.7b\]**, and that ‘using photographic images from their own communities and heritage encouraged \[…\] ownership of the history of their town’ and developed the students’ ‘sense of their place in it’ **\[5.7c\].** Students commented ‘you get that sense of pride because you know that you have done it yourself’; ‘you could become someone from this’; ‘I never thought I was going to do stuff like this and I am really excited for my future’; and ‘it gave me the confidence to go out and do more.’ **\[5.7b\]**

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from the ‘Who Buys My Food’ \(WBMF\) project at UEA has transformed the performance of small\-scale food and drink businesses supplying Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket chain. The project has developed tools to deliver customised market intelligence and support to small\-scale suppliers, improving their marketing capability and enabling a more targeted allocation of their scarce resources. At a time when Tesco aimed to reduce the number of products by 15% per annum over three years, WBMF findings showed how to improve the supplier\-retailer relationship and how small\-scale businesses could protect themselves from product de\-listing. In Northern Ireland, WBMF collaborated with InvestNI, enabling InvestNI to take a more active “hands on” approach in supporting local firms. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The ‘Who Buys My Food’ project has provided Professor Fearne’s research group with access to a large sample of small businesses operating within the same distribution channel \(supermarkets\) and supplying the same customer \(Tesco\) over a considerable period of time \(15yrs\). Through a model of co\-produced research in collaboration with individual suppliers, Tesco and InvestNI, WBMF has discovered a number of counter\-intuitive processes, practices and tensions, and developed solutions and recommended actions for the stakeholders. 

-  In small businesses, there is a tension between marketing and sales which results in the disproportionate allocation of resources towards short term sales growth at the expense of long\-term market development, increasing the vulnerability of small businesses in the medium term. \[ **3.2**\] 

-  The use of customised market intelligence has an impact on marketing performance <ins>only</ins> when it is used instrumentally or conceptually to inform decisions, rather than symbolically to justify decisions that have already been made. \[ **3.4**\] 

-  Experimental field research revealed that the most commonly used formats for the presentation of market intelligence are inadequate in the specific context of marketing decision\-making in small businesses, which is invariably reliant on individuals with different levels of experience with data in general and market intelligence in particular. \[ **3.5**\] 

-  The existence of an established relationship with a retailer does not afford protection against de\-listing, which instead requires suppliers to invest in the \(long term\) improvement in brand diffusion. \[ **3.1**\] 

-  Market power can be a force for good, with small\-scale suppliers who perceive their treatment by a dominant retail customer to be fair more likely to allocate relationship\-specific investments for mutual long\-term benefit. \[ **3.3**\] 

-  Contrary to common assumption, faster selling lines are not necessarily scrutinised more closely by store managers, and therefore are at risk of suffering from out of stocks, justifying greater supplier involvement in maintaining product availability where and when it matters most. \[ **3.6**\]

 4. Details of the impact 

 The growth of the Tesco Local range over the previous decade had afforded hundreds of small\-scale food and drink producers the opportunity to access mainstream supermarket distribution. Tesco’s ‘Project Re\-set’, launched in 2016, was the largest range rationalisation project in their history, seeking to reduce the number of products listed by 15% per annum over the following three years.  This signalled a significant change in Tesco’s strategy, leaving small\-scale producers vulnerable to de\-listing if their products under\-performed. 

 Against this backdrop, findings from the co\-produced research in the WBMF project have directly led to improved performance by small\-scale suppliers and improved their relationship with the retailer. The research has also informed the development of marketing support for small\-scale suppliers in Northern Ireland. 

 <ins> **Impact on Individual Small</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>Scale Food and Drink Suppliers**</ins> 

 The primary beneficiaries are the 113 small\-scale food and drink producers engaged in the WBMF project, which has reduced the risk of product de\-listing and helped them achieve above\-average sales growth during a period of unprecedented uncertainty. 

 **Better resource allocation leading to above\-average sales growth \[3.1, 3.4, 3.6\]:** Over the three years following the launch of ‘Project Re\-Set’ suppliers reported their total sales had grown by an average of 20% \[ **5.1**, Q.67\], of which they attribute 18% \[ **5.1**, Q.68\] to their involvement in the WBMF project. Moreover, during the twelve months from November 2019 to November 2020, sales grew by an average of 33%, compared to 6% for the relevant product categories \[ **5.2**\]. Much of this success is due to the ability of businesses to adapt to the changing market environment and use their scarce marketing resources more effectively, which the WBMF project has made possible through the provision of customised market intelligence which small\-scale suppliers would otherwise be denied: 

 “Who Buys My Food has become such a valuable resource enabling us to punch above our weight as a small supplier. In this highly dynamic and fast moving market it is essential to have the data and insights you are providing, as we can’t effectively plan and manage what we don’t know.” \[Cleone Foods **5.6**\] 

 “We *can now monitor our performance and see who our customers are and where and when they are purchasing our products. This helps us to tailor our promotions, positioning and sampling events to the needs of our customer – something we would struggle to do otherwise.*"" \[Thistly Cross Cider **5.3**\] 

 *“We had confidence in the strength of our brand but the shopper insight report was a real wake\-up call and prompted us to be more much more pro\-active in engaging our core shoppers. The in\-store sampling not only lifted out penetration rates but brought us into direct contact with our consumers, which generated lots of useful feedback.”* \[Doherty’s Meats **5.4**\] 

 **Engagement with the WBMF data visualisation tool leading to improved performance \[3.5\]:** WBMF research informed a re\-design of the web data visualisation tool in 2020. This tool provides on\-line access from any device at any time and a more differentiated approach to data visualisation, making it efficient for a user to find key data quickly. Metrics from the use of the application show a high frequency of short\-period user access with significant benefits at the level of the individual decision\-maker. For example, 51% of users reported an increase in their productivity, 57% reported an increase in their effectiveness and 62% reported an increase in their performance \[ **5.1**, Q.47\] and that of their organisation: 

 *“The web\-application made it possible for us to access critical pieces of information when we needed it most \(during the lockdown\) and share it with the buyer with a level of detail that made it easier for us to make our case for launching a bigger bottle in the right stores at the right price, which was beneficial to Tesco as well as our business.”* \[Nix & Kix **5.6**\] 

 **Improved functional capability amongst account managers \[3.2, 3.4\]:** When asked how their involvement in the WBMF project had affected their individual \(functional\) performance, 66% of respondents reported a significant improvement in their sales management, 69% reported a significant improvement in their account management, 57% reported a significant improvement in their marketing management and 57% reported an improvement in their use of market intelligence \[ **5.1**, Q.10\]. In terms of specific marketing areas 74% reported they were *“better equipped for meetings with the Tesco buyer”,* 67% reported they were “ *better able to plan promotions*”, 53% found the research findings made a “ *significant contribution to new product development*” and 42% found them helpful with respect to the “ *design of new packaging”*. \[ **5.1**, Q.41\]. Moreover, 71% reported the project had enabled them to learn *“the value of shopper insight”* and \(63%\) *“the value of evidence\-based decision\-making”,* whilst 60% reported that the project had made a “ *significant contribution to the development of our relationship with Tesco.”* \[ **5.1**, Q.76\]

 **Reduced the risk of product de\-listing \[3.1, 3.3\]:** During ‘Project Re\-Set’, survival was the primary goal for small\-scale suppliers. The WBMF project helped suppliers to identify appropriate action to improve two of the key performance metrics, customer penetration and repeat purchase rate, that Tesco used to identify candidates for de\-listing. 

 In February 2020, 86% of respondents to the supplier survey reported a significant increase in their market knowledge, 76% reported a significant improvement in their relationship with the Tesco buyer and 63% had found the project invaluable in helping them to avoid product de\-listing \[ **5.1**, Q.43\]. 

 One month later, the Covid\-19 pandemic resulted in a national lockdown with devastating impacts on a large number of suppliers. The threat of de\-listing was intensified due to the pressure on supermarket supply chains and shelf\-space for essential items, and the WBMF project sought to provide further assistance. WBMF demonstrated that suppliers who invested in their relationship with Tesco, by developing mutually beneficial proposals informed by customised market intelligence, were more likely to develop lasting relationships and perform better with Tesco. 

 *“We needed to understand how demand was changing as a result \[of\] the pandemic and adapt our business accordingly… the insights we gained from the WBMF project were invaluable… you guys absolutely rock and all the tools were super useful\!”* \[Nix&Kix **5.6**\]. 

 **Adoption of regional overlays for more effective ranging of local lines in Tesco \[3.6\]:** A key message of WBMF to suppliers during ‘Project Re\-Set’ was to resist the temptation of increased distribution and to focus instead on performing better in fewer stores – those where latent demand was strongest but not yet fully exploited. This would ensure that customer penetration and repeat purchase rate would increase, reducing the threat of de\-listing. 

 WBMF also highlighted to the Tesco Local team a flaw in Tesco’s approach to the ranging of local lines. The existing process for introducing a local line involved the identification of an under\-performing product which could be replaced by the local variant. The problem was that the local line was automatically allocated to the stores in which the failing product was listed. In most cases this extended beyond the region in which the product was produced, resulting in a store allocation that was not aligned with consumer demand. The person responsible for ranging local lines in Tesco then set to work on the changes necessary. Six months later regional ‘overlays’ were introduced, enabling buyers to range local lines within the county in which they were produced: 

 *“the messages \(you\) were giving to suppliers at the regional supplier events regarding the pursuit of increased distribution of their products \(‘be careful what you wish for’\) contributed towards the changes that Tesco made in the ranging of local lines, to enable a more targeted store allocation with county/regional overlays”* \[ **5.7**\]. 

 This change made it possible for suppliers to remove the ‘long tail’ of stores in which their sales were negligible, which were pulling down their \(average\) performance measures, and focus on their key customer and their core stores, thereby reducing the threat of de\-listing and increase the return on their more targeted allocation of marketing resources. 

 <ins> **Impact at Sector Level**</ins> 

 **Transformation of public\-funded marketing support for the growth and development of food businesses in Northern Ireland \[3.2, 3.4\]:** Agri\-food is the largest industry in Northern Ireland, and in 2015 InvestNI, the business development agency for Northern Ireland, was charged with delivering a strategic action plan with the aim of “g *rowing a sustainable, profitable and integrated agri\-food supply chain, focused on delivering the needs of the market*”. One strategic investment was the creation of the consumer insights team. WBMF was engaged to provide customised market intelligence for small\-scale producers supplying Tesco, by far the largest supermarket in Northern Ireland and in the process provided a catalyst for change in InvestNI from “hands off” to “hands on”: 

 “*The research that Professor Fearne and his team have undertaken on the benefits of evidence\-based decision making and the work we have done together \(webinars, workshops and case studies\) to develop the capability within our clients has brought us much closer to the companies with whom we work. This has enabled us to provide more ‘hands on’ support, which Andrew’s research revealed was essential if we wanted to turn insight into action and achieve a greater return on the significant investment we make annually on market intelligence.”* \[ **5.8**\]. 

 In 2020, InvestNI undertook an evaluation of the impact of the WBMF project \[ **5.9**\] which: 

 “*revealed that 94% of the businesses involved were “extremely satisfied” with the project. Many of them reported growth in revenue, improved relationships with their retail customers and an acknowledgement that they were better informed and more effective in targeting their marketing resources”* \[ **5.8**\] 

 This resulted in an additional GBP500,000 in sales from new product listings in Northern Ireland and GBP2,300,000 from new product listings in GB \[ **5.9** page 4\], thereby: 

 “*supporting the business case for investment of public funds into the provision of consumer insight to the agri\-food sector in Northern Ireland*” \[ **5.8**\].

 **E\-Science Projects** 

 Starting in 2001, colleagues in the School of Mathematics and Statistics \(now the School, of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics\) collaborated with researchers in Computing Science and Biomedical Sciences on several BBSRC E\-science and bioinformatics research programmes \[G1\-G4\]. Relevant aspects of two of these projects \(BASIS and CaliBayes\) are summarised below. The underlying premise of all projects was a commitment to Bayesian modelling \(e.g. \[P1\]\) and a recognition of the need to provide complete packages of data science techniques. A common theme was the implementation of computationally intensive methods running on remote computer clusters. This nascent cloud computing pre\-dated the rise of the current ubiquitous cloud \(Amazon AWS was launched in 2006\), enabling collaborative stakeholders to use this technological solution much earlier than what was commercially available at the time. 

 The BASIS \(Biology of Ageing e\-Science Integration and Simulation\) project \[P1\] was a flexible web\-service based modelling system which was developed to allow parallel and distributed approaches to simulation and inference \[P2\]. It was effectively a set of web services that allowed users to incorporate simulation tools into their workflows \[P3\]. In 2002, web\-services were very much in their infancy and connecting disparate services was challenging. Today, many Jumping Rivers \(JR\) data science projects consume data from a variety of application programming interface \(API\) endpoints, e.g. weather data. The key to combining different data sources is a standard interface. The BASIS project provided the foundation for these skills by developing the SBML framework that enables the exchange of statistical models and data sets \[P4\]. 

 The second project, CaliBayes, developed techniques for calibrating complex stochastic models against experimental data, with careful attention to the selection of parameter combinations at which to run expensive and time\-consuming simulators \[P5\]. Crucially, these techniques were running statistical algorithms in the pre\-cloud. Indeed, figures 1 & 2 in \[P5\] provide a data pipeline architecture, that includes API requests, load balancing and secure data access points, that underpin the architecture currently used by JR for data pipelines within their industrial and business client base. 

 **Creation of a data analytics company** 

 The primary aim of research in statistical methodology and data science is to produce new or improved techniques for use in practical applications. While academics may be able to install and experiment with the latest statistical software, commercial/enterprise users face significant challenges in implementing new techniques. These hurdles include accessing data, maintaining data security, upgrading statistical software, selecting the methods, applying model diagnostics, and moving from a testing to a production environment. 

 Jumping Rivers PLC is an independent company that was formed in 2016 because of the NU research and alongside an increased demand for support in implementing data science and statistical methods. The Newcastle research \[P1\-P5\] and programmes \[G1\-G4\] provided early recognition that science could best leverage increased computing power through integrated approaches that cover all aspects of the data pipeline, from data entry and storage through Bayesian modelling and computationally intensive statistical inference on remote computer clusters, to visualisation and prediction. 

 The research focussed on applications in systems biology and the biology of ageing, but the techniques are generic. During the research and subsequently, it became clear that diverse organisations needed integrated data science approaches. With the School's core focus being research and teaching, an opportunity was identified to commercialise the research. Gillespie, who had been a research associate on one of the e\-science grants and was subsequently a Lecturer then Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, was frequently consulted from around 2010 by external organisations seeking to implement their own circle\-of\-data systems. Recognising that demand was high and likely to increase, Gillespie reduced his University employment to part\-time in 2016 and co\-founded JR.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Creation of a data science company** 

 Jumping Rivers is a Newcastle\-based analytics company specialising in data science and machine learning \[E1\]. The company commenced trading in October 2016 and is co\-located on the Newcastle Helix site alongside the multi\-million\-pound National Innovation Centre for Data. JR work impacts on businesses in fields as diverse as biotechnology, finance, DigiTech, manufacturing, chemicals, utilities, and healthcare. 

 *“Newcastle University’s research has been fundamental in* *creating our company Jumping Rivers*, *providing the company’s core infrastructure* and *enabling a diverse range of services to be offered to our customers”.* \[E2\]. 

 **Meeting North East challenges** 

 Compared to other parts of the UK, the North East has traditionally experienced fewer and lower quality job opportunities. JR has directly met several objectives of the North East Strategic Economic Plan \[E3\] such as “creating more and better jobs” and providing growth and services within the digital sector. JR is a highly skilled team with individuals holding qualifications including four PhDs in statistics and six MScs in statistics/computing science. All staff are situated in the North East delivering projects on a global level. The ten technical members of staff specialise in areas such as simulation tools, optimised workflows, cloud\-computing, statistical inference, and parallel and distributed approaches. 

 **Impacts** 

 Since the financial year 2016\-17, JR \[E2, E4\]: 

-  annual turnover has increased from £49K to £638K in 2019/20 

-  operating profits have increased from £4K to £184K in 2019/20 

-  staff numbers have increased to a headcount of 13 \(12.4 FTE\) as of March 2021 

-  has delivered projects for over 100 organisations in Europe, North America, and Africa 

-  has provided pro\-bono sponsorship for over 40 global events, for example in the Ivory Coast, Uganda, and South Africa 

 The techniques created through Newcastle University e\-science projects have been developed so that JR now offer a complete service through ongoing support, applied research, training, and consulting. Projects include establishing effective data infrastructures, running robust computational statistical models, generating reproducible data analysis reports, and enabling statistical inference. All these approaches enhance business decision making through the improved use of data. 

 JR has delivered impact across many areas; two exemplars are provided below covering the biotechnology and utilities sectors: 

 Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies \(FDB\) is a global\-based organisation specialising in cell culture, microbial fermentation, and gene therapies. Since 2018, JR has collaborated with FDB to optimise their data collation, usage, and analysis process. FDB has multiple research groups situated in a variety of locations across the world, these teams regularly share large complex data sets. Working closely with a FDB team, JR built a cloud\-based data pipeline to conduct process and analytical risk assessments. The risk assessments, built around a Failure Modes and Effect Analysis platform, enable FDB and their clients to identify, numerically score and visualise risks to manufacturing on the journey to commercialising therapeutic drugs. 

 The digital application is used by all FDB sites globally and has increased their proficiency, elevating client facing capabilities. There are numerous benefits to this work including; more effective prioritisation of tasks in late stage development; reduced chances of errors; enhanced communication of risk to clients; and improved demonstration of risk management systems to global regulatory health authorities including the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. The work has helped FDB to demonstrate their recognition of the importance of effective risk management. 

 *“Jumping Rivers and Newcastle University have both contributed significantly to our global operations”*. \[E5\]. 

 Northumbrian Water Limited \(NWL\) serves 1.3 million properties in the North East of England, and 794,000 properties in Essex and Sussex, primarily through water and sewage services. In recent years, reducing leakage and interruptions to supply have been high priority targets for NWL, its customers, and Ofwat \(the water industry regulator\). 

 Since 2018, JR have developed and integrated within NWL data\-driven solutions to address leakage and supply interruptions problems. Development of the e\-science application was on the Microsoft Azure Cloud, which matched the internal cloud of NWL, and allowed constant feedback to the new application. Data was gathered via APIs from a variety of internal and external sources. Reducing the time taken for 35 engineers to access the required data from two hours to 15 minutes has resulted in annual savings, reduced leakage and reduced interruptions. 

 The insights provided by JR have been valuable for enhancing NWL service delivery, primarily for NWL customers, but also for NWL themselves, as high performance in these areas is linked to considerable financial incentives. 

 *“Jumping Rivers have demonstrated the value and capabilities of new technologies which we now are looking to adopt further within NWL. Their expertise spans a range of analytics, data science and deployment technologies \-including the Microsoft Azure Cloud \- which they leverage to build impactful and insightful Proof of Concept models and analyses”.* \[E6\]. 

 NU’s research through JR has provided the bedrock of these case studies and many other projects, enabling commercial, economic, and educational impact within diverse contexts.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted at the University of Dundee investigating European avant\-garde art through video and photography archives has led to the following impacts: 

-  Halted the deterioration of key works of art\-historical and cultural value, leading to major exhibitions in Bucharest and Sao Paolo of previously unknown or inaccessible materials; 

-  Created accessible online archive resources revealing the histories of video and performance to new generations; 

-  Built new audiences through publication, broadcast and exhibition, including the direct initiation of seminal exhibitions in Edinburgh, Venice and Shanghai; and 

-  Engaged with the museum sector to ensure works which we have restored are preserved within national collections in London and Edinburgh, ensuring ongoing benefit through public access. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research into the histories of the post\-war British and European avant\-gardes was initiated through two AHRC funded projects: REWIND *Artists’ Video in the 1970s & 1980s* \( **Partridge** 2003\-2007\), and *The Demarco Archive: Accessing a 40\-year Dialogue between Richard Demarco and the European Avant\-Garde* \( **McArthur** 2004\-2008\). 

 REWIND researchers investigated the first two decades of British video art, addressing gaps in the knowledge of early and pioneering work conducted in the UK between 1970\-90. The research involved the investigation of over 400 seminal artworks. These were archived and conserved using emerging technologies, simultaneously researching and developing restoration techniques for obsolete analogue video formats, thus revealing and preserving lost works in their original conceptual and technical context **\[R5\]**. This innovative work led to the establishment of the REWIND *Media Preservation Lab* in 2005, this is now a key research centre in the UK for the investigation of improved methods by which we can preserve a wider range of obsolete media. In 2006 we established the first of our online databases: REWIND *Artists Video*. 

 From this, further AHRC projects were established: REWIND *Italia* \( **Partridge** 2011\-14\) and *European Women’s Video Art* \( **Shemilt** 2015\-18\). Both studies re\-evaluated marginalised practice in the canon of media art history. The results of this research were published in two books  with chapters by **Partridge, Shemilt, Lockhart** and **Leuzzi** **\[R2\]**. *REWIND | Italia, Early Video Art in Italy*, which brings seminal, early video experimentation into the international spotlight and provides a vital resource for research and study with key Italian texts available for the first time in English **\[R2\]**. *European Women’s Video Art in the 70s and 80s* provides a reassessment of women artists’ involvement in early video art and strengthens their profiles and identities within the art historical canon **\[R3\]** – on its launch, the Director of Civic Museums Venice \(5/9/19\) stated: 

 ‘*Finally a book is published that collects the most significant evidence of extraordinary work often on the sidelines of knowledge and art history*’ **\[E1\]**. 

 The *Demarco Digital Archive* **\[R4\]** was established in 2008 \(updated 2017\) by a team of six, led by **McArthur**. It created a fully searchable online resource of over 10,000 photographs and 700 supporting documents. In the course of the research over half a million photographic prints, slides and negatives were viewed and selected according to agreed criteria. The content covered the extensive range of Demarco’s engagement with the visual art, theatre and post\-war cultural milieu, particularly from Eastern Europe. 

 An enduring function of the research preserved in the Archive is to reveal the lost art of the post\-war period, particularly by the artists of Poland, Romania and the former Yugoslavia who, along with parts of Germany, were trapped behind the Iron Curtain. The discovery and restoration of the video footage of Taduesz Kantor’s *The Water Hen* **\[R1\]**, shot in an obscure format even for 1972, is detailed later in this case study. There is growing interest in these countries among younger and independent curators working to reclaim the ‘unofficial’ art proscribed by the art establishments of the communist era; through its preservation of culturally significant artefacts Archive is enabling the curation of public exhibitions and performances of historical and cultural importance that would otherwise remain inaccessible. 

 Elements of research initiated within REWIND and Demarco Digital have now been consolidated and further expanded through *Richard Demarco: The Italian Connection* \(AHRC 2018\-20\) led by **Shemilt** with **Partridge, Leuzzi** and **Lockhart**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Two teams of researchers within the *Visual Practice, Curation and Critique* research grouping at DJCAD have, over the last sixteen years, investigated aspects of British and European art practice from the 1960s onward, having drawn on expertise developed within our Digital Archives. Projects informed or initiated by these archives have created a global engagement of over half a million visits. The online databases currently receive an average of 700 active users per month, the majority in the younger age bracket of 18\-44 \(Google Analytics retrieved 10/12/20\); in addition, the Demarco Digital Archive has 164 subscribers, each of whom have made their own online curations. 

 Preservation and democratisation of cultural assets 

 McArthur and Watson’s research into the Demarco Digital Archive uncovered original video reels of Tadeusz Kantor’s *The Water Hen* from a performance in 1972. The previously unknown footage  was digitized and restored by Lockhart, transcribed by researchers at Kantor’s archive in Krakow, then translated in Edinburgh. This formed the basis for McArthur’s subtitling, moving the raw translation into English that paralleled the colloquial nature of the original dialogue. 

 The significance of the footage was confirmed by the leading Kantor scholar, who spoke at the press launch of the *UNESCO International Year of Kantor*: 

 ‘*The efforts of the Media Archives Team cannot be overstated… prior to the discovery and digitization of the Kurka Wodna/Water Hen footage, there was no recording available of Kantor’s productions from his object/machine theatre, 1944\-1975… Consequently, any effort to provide analysis of performance style or on\-stage dramaturgy in Kantor’s theatre was speculative and inconclusive*.’ **\[E3\]** 

 In 2015 *The Water Hen* was screened in Venice during the Biennale, and subsequently in Gdansk, Warsaw, Berlin, Dusseldorf and Tokyo. The restored *Water Hen* was central to a major exhibition in Sao Paolo \(18/8/15\-14/11/15\) attended by 90,000 visitors. 

 The exhibition *24 Arguments:* *Early Encounters in Romanian Neo\-Avant\-Garde 1969\-71* at The National Museum of Romania similarly drew on materials restored and preserved by the research team, in this case the digitization of a film capturing two seminal performances made by Paul Neagu during his thirty\-year exile in the UK, described as: 

 ‘*an essential act in the exhibition, given the fact that the Romanian public have never had access to the works and documents presented in the exhibition*.’ **\[E2\]** 

 The REWIND *Media Preservation Lab* has ensured the preservation of footage that would otherwise have been lost to future generations, as evidenced by projects such as the *The London Community Video Archive* \(with Goldsmiths\), which provides a significant record of counter\-cultural events and happenings in 70s & 80s London. The Lab’s work in transferring obsolete video to digital formats has been praised as ‘ *recovering and revising this history... as a resource for contemporary debates and activism*’ **\[E4\]**. 

 Lockhart’s curation of works from REWIND featured along with >>FFWD Artist’s Moving Image from Scotland, as part of CURRENT, Phase Two at the Shanghai Minsheng Art Museum \(17/12/16\-15/1/17\). This was the second in a series of exhibitions across China and brought seminal early UK video works to China for the first time, exhibited alongside contemporary Scottish video art. The exhibition received 7,500 actual visitors and 157,000 online visits, garnering media attention across 45 outlets including the Shanghai Daily \(22/12/16\), which stated: 

 ‘*Excavating the radical history encapsulated in seminal artists video works from the 70s & 80s, REWIND provides an in\-depth perspective on the moving image*.’ **\[E5\]** 

 A catalyst for physical and digital cultural legacies 

 In 2014 Creative Scotland commissioned a consultancy which recommended uniting the materials still held by Demarco with those in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art \(this had been prompted by an earlier exhibition curated by McArthur and Watson which had provoked a debate in the Scottish Parliament committing the Scottish Government to housing the Demarco Archive\). An extensive site was purchased in north Edinburgh and plans for the new building were passed in 2018. The consolidated archive will be housed as a discrete unit within the planned £75 million National Galleries of Scotland \(NGS\) Collections Hub. This is described by the Director General NGS as a: 

 ‘*significant infrastructure development in a socially deprived area in Edinburgh…construction is scheduled to start 2022/3… A significant part of this building will be publicly accessible facilities for research, study, exhibitions and education*.’ **\[E6\]** 

 A further impact of our growing reputation for digital archiving has led the internationally renowned performance artist, Alastair MacLennan, to deposit his entire archive \(21/12/18\) documenting over 600 performances and installations to join existing holdings of his work within REWIND and *Demarco Digital*. This gives a unique opportunity to capture the development of this growing legacy through a living archive. 

 Several major acquisitions were made, by Tate, of historic works made visible by REWIND, embedding a significant body of under\-represented work within a national collection and consequently ensuring the long\-term conservation and further dissemination through one of the most important collections of modern and contemporary art in the world. The expertise of the research team is acknowledged by the Tate: 

 ‘… *only 2 or 3 possible laboratories in the world with this set of skills and knowledge… that not only could transfer this early video format, but would also understand the context of video art in the 70s*…’ **\[E8\]** 

 The acquisitions include David Hall’s *TV Interruptions: The Installation* acquired in 2014; Stephen Partridge’s *Monitor* in 2015, exhibited 2016\-17. Tina Keane’s *Faded Wallpaper* \(1988\) and her *In Our Hands Greenham* \(1984\) were acquired in 2017 and 2020 respectively, following research into, and reconstitution of, the original installation **\[E7\]**. *The Lab* also collaborated with Tate in 2019, \(prior to accession and exhibition\) on the digitisation of Darcy Lange’s pioneering social documentary video practice: *Studies of Teaching in Four Oxfordshire Schools* \(1977\). 

 These ‘ *pioneering but previously overlooked’* **\[E7\]** video works are now central to Tate’s digital legacy. The contribution of REWIND and its related projects are described by the responsible acquisitions manager \(now at The Museum of Modern Art, New York\) as ‘ *crucial to re\-assessing the canon of UK video art’* **\[E7\]**. 

 Stimulating and showcasing creative works 

 Publications stemming from REWIND activity led to wider impact by opening artists’ video to a general audience. *REWIND | Italia, Early Video Art in Italy* brings seminal, early video experimentation into an international spotlight, providing a vital resource for research and study by making important Italian texts available for the first time in English **\[R2\]**. The UK Launch included a performance at CCA, Glasgow by artist Claudio Ambrosini described by *Art Monthly* \(9/16\) as: 

 *‘a significant piece of research and a vital contribution to any library of video art history’* and *Italian Journal Arshake \(2/3/16\) ‘a useful and extremely valuable too*l’ **\[E9\]**. 

 Conversely an extended, non\-specialist audience of 300,000 \(production company academy7\) were introduced, most for the first time, to artist’s video in *Kill Your TV, Jim Moir’s* \(Vic Reeves\) *Weird World of Video Art* \(BBC4 24/11/19 with further audiences via iPlayer and repeat broadcast\). Lockhart was both consultant and interviewee whilst works by Partridge and Shemilt were among twelve selected from the REWIND archive featured on the programme. All unedited interviews from the programme were deposited in the REWIND archive **\[E10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Construction projects repeatedly suffer from poor value for money, dissatisfied clients and expensive legal disputes. Research at King’s College London’s Centre of Construction Law, led by Professor David Mosey, identified shortcomings in contracts as the source of many of these avoidable problems. To remedy these failings, King’s researchers created, tested and supported a new type of contract designed to: \(i\) improve integration of the roles of consultants, contractors and subcontractors; \(ii\) ensure the timely sharing and agreement of accurate designs, costs, programmes and risk information; and \(iii\) embed learning from one project to the next. The resultant Framework Alliance Contract \(FAC\-1\) was rapidly accepted by the construction industry and its clients. With training and guidance from the King’s research team, FAC\-1 has been used to procure social housing, schools, highways and public buildings with an estimated total value of GBP45,000,000,000. In 2020, new UK Government guidance, known as the *Construction Playbook,* formally recommended FAC\-1's use as a contract that can achieve many of the government's stated ambitions for ‘better, faster, greener’ construction procurement following the COVID\-19 pandemic. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Large\-scale construction projects are notoriously difficult to manage. Drawing upon government and industry reports from over many years, Mosey sought to identify the sources of problems and to offer solutions. 

#  Understanding the problems with contracts 

 King’s research found that inefficiency and excessive disputes in the construction industry were attributable in part to the use of fragmented, reactive contracts. This held back the progress of the industry and led to many misunderstandings, disputes and poor quality, unsafe constructions \[1\]. In particular, Mosey found that traditional contracts focused primarily on allocating risks and did not integrate or connect the roles of the different team members. 

 In addition, the research highlighted that contracts tend to govern only the construction phase of the project rather than connecting the design, construction and operation phases of a project \[1\]. This leads to reliance on incomplete and inaccurate information and to inefficient, fragmented working practices. General contractors and specialist subcontractors are appointed too late in the process for them to influence the optimum approaches to design quality, safety, cost and timeliness, and to the effective management of risks \[1\]. As a result, construction contracts have not supported the long\-term relationships necessary to embed learning between projects and encourage investment in new technologies and modern methods of construction \[2\]. The researchers also examined the confusion and problems caused where collaboration relies only on the principle of good faith, and considered the large number of disputes resulting from this vaguely expressed relational commitment \[1,3\]. 

#  Identifying areas for improvement 

 King’s researchers examined the key components of collaborative contract models and the ways in which these components improve relationships and working practices. With a variety of key stakeholders, they explored how new contractual relationships and systems can improve project outcomes by creating lateral relationships between team members and integrating the roles of consultants, contractors and subcontractors. By examining a large number of live projects, they revealed how contractual systems that use collaborative procurement can lead to improved designs, better risk management and enhanced working methods. The researchers found that this shared knowledge can lead to not only significant cost savings but also social value, such as improved employment and training opportunities that are not available to the parties individually \[1\]. This work revealed the potential benefits of a new, more collaborative strategy, based on multi\-party alliance contracts that provide for joint analysis of design, cost, time and risk data \[1\]. 

 In addition, King’s research found that embedding learning from one project to the next and connecting successive projects delivered more effective, sustainable and socially valuable outcomes. It revealed that multi\-party contracts governing long\-term collaborative relationships, supported by collective performance measurement and decision\-making \[1,2\], lead to improved outcomes that capture enhanced knowledge and lessons learned as well as the prospect of a long\-term pipeline of work \[1,2\]. 

#  The Framework Alliance Contract 

 King’s researchers explored the possibilities for mitigating the challenges associated with traditional contracts through a new overarching contractual integrator. They drafted a new standard form known as FAC\-1 that integrated the work of the parties engaged on multiple projects or on the components of a single complex project. It was designed for use in any common law or civil law jurisdiction \[2\]. 

 The contract was evaluated in consultation with 120 organisations in 14 jurisdictions, at numerous conferences and workshops, and was tested with early adopters. The team found that the early direct connections between team members established by the contract improved the mutual understanding of their responsibilities. The new integrated relationships and long\-term appointments also improved their commitment to collaborative working \[2\]. They found that FAC\-1 enabled cost savings and more sustainable designs; reduced defects and carbon footprint; extended warranties; increased opportunities for small and medium\-sized enterprises; created new employment and training initiatives; jointly managed risks and reduced potential disputes \[1,2\]. 

 Mosey worked alongside the UK Cabinet Office with seven trial project teams engaged in constructing social housing, highways, schools and other municipal buildings to explore the effects of collaborative early contractor involvement and Building Information Modelling \(BIM\) on the delivery of economic and social value \[1,4\]. King’s researchers found that the new contractual relationships and processes helped the trial project teams to minimise inaccurate assumptions regarding designs, costs, programming and risks that can arise from late contractor appointments.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 The empirical testing conducted by Mosey demonstrated the potential advantages of the FAC\-1 as an effective collaborative contract, in particular for public bodies, local and central government. As a result, FAC\-1 has been used extensively, underpinning new UK construction guidelines responding to COVID\-19 and changing practices on construction projects in the UK and other jurisdictions. 

#  Impact on key projects 

 The success of the early stages of the project led to Mosey’s appointment as lead mentor and academic partner for the UK Cabinet Office’s ‘trial projects’ initiative in 2013. This enabled the publication of guidance by the UK Cabinet Office in January 2014, recommending the use of preconstruction phase contractor appointments governed by collaborative contracts, incorporating the FAC\-1 principles \[A\] and in turn leading to the publication of FAC\-1. The results of these initiatives were compelling, with FAC\-1 being adopted on procurements totalling over GBP45,000,000,000 in five countries between 2013 and 2018 \[B\]. From these initiatives, a range of tangible benefits emerged. 

 The use of FAC\-1 has led to significant cost savings. For example, Surrey County Council and Kier Services Highways achieved savings in excess of 12% which were sustained over a five\-year programme of work on local road infastructure. The Surrey\-Kier alliance then secured savings of approximately 8% against prices under their previous contract model \[C\]. Futures Housing Group \(which provides affordable housing\) created an FAC\-1 alliance with Travis Perkins and 21 small contractors which achieved average savings of 9 **%** against their previous framework in its first year \[D\]. These savings were partly due to FAC\-1 connecting small contractors directly to national supplier Travis Perkins on more favourable terms than they could have obtained separately. Agreed alliance savings have since risen to between 16% and 22% \[D\]. Ian Skipp, Group Finance and Resources Director of Futures Housing Group, stated that in using the FAC\-1 alliance, “the sense of truly belonging to a collaborative group is clearly apparent” \[D\]. 

 FAC\-1 has a focus on social value, ensuring that those at all levels of the construction process are considered. By enhancing collaboration and focusing on social value, FAC\-1 has led to the development of significant employment and training initiatives. Futures Housing Group used FAC\-1 to agree and implement support for small contractors through local training and employment initiatives, including creating their own Training Academy \[D\]. In addition, the Surrey\-Kier alliance developed the award\-winning S\-Skills Programme that attracted almost 100 apprentices in 2019. All of them had been through the Youth Justice System and were generally people seen as “furthest from employment” \[C\]. The Surrey\-Kier alliance also developed the Surrey Infrastructure Academy, aimed at filling professional and managerial shortages in the construction industry. Commitments from supply chain alliance members included local employment and skills development opportunities and encouraging local recruitment \[C\]. The positive environmental impact of FAC\-1 has ranged from the greater use of local businesses and local workforces, to design innovations of subcontractors and manufacturers, and the improved recycling of materials \[E\]. FAC\-1 has also helped to improve safety, user satisfaction, sharing of data and sustainability of projects. 

#  Underpinning UK guidance: FAC\-1 in national construction guidelines 

 The results from early adoption of FAC\-1 in the sectors of social housing, highways and education led King’s research \[1,2,3\] directly to influence UK Government procurement practices. For example, as a result of close collaboration and consultation with King’s researchers, the UK Crown Commercial Service now uses FAC\-1 for all its new frameworks \[F\]. In 2020 the UK Cabinet Office also recommended FAC\-1 as the contract through which clients and teams can achieve improved outcomes from long\-term commitments \[G\]. 

 In response to the COVID\-19 pandemic, the UK Government sought ways to stimulate the economy and, as part of this, the ‘build back better, build back greener, build back faster’ strategy seeks to accelerate construction procurement. On the basis on his published research, Mosey was the only legal academic invited by the Cabinet Office to join the consultation. He was part of the drafting group that produced *The Construction Playbook Government Commercial Guidance*, which gives specific advice on sourcing and contracting for public works projects and programmes \[G\]. FAC\-1 underpinned this pan\-government publication. 

 *The Construction Playbook*: 

-  Establishes 14 new policies for improved procurement practices designed to deliver ‘better, faster and greener solutions’ that support recovery from the pandemic, helping to build the economy while improving building and workplace safety, and including green initiatives to minimise waste and greenhouse gas emissions \[G\]. The 14 new policies are required to be adopted on a ‘comply or explain basis’ *a*nd the guide recommends FAC\-1 to help achieve “many of the ambitions set out in this Playbook” \[G\]. 

-  Details how government and industry can utilise collaborative relationships and contractual systems of the type underpinning FAC\-1 to deliver public sector works in a more modern and efficient way. It states: “A successful framework contract should be based around principles that align objectives, success measures, targets and incentives so as to enable joint work on improving value and reducing risk. This should then be combined with transparent performance measurement and work allocation procedures. The FAC1 framework is a good example of a standard form framework contract that can achieve this” \[G\]. 

-  Recommends FAC\-1 as the means by which public sector clients and their teams should adopt long\-term contracts, invest in modern methods of construction, embed the use of BIM as a digital solution, procure using early supply chain involvement and outcome\-based performance measurement, and apply benchmarking for a better understanding of costs. It endorses FAC\-1 as an effective contract that is structured to enable the efficient exchange of data, to drive collaboration, to improve value and to manage risk \[G\]. 

-  Includes a Compact with Industry signed by representatives of 48 professional bodies, consultants and contractors. These signatories recognise the value of FAC\-1 as the preferred medium for delivering better, faster, greener solutions through the establishment of new lateral relationships between team members and of new systems of timely information exchange \[G\]. 

 The UK New Prisons programme is described as a pathfinder project for implementation of *The Construction Playbook*. Sue McElroy, Deputy Director, New Prison Capacity at the Ministry of Justice, stated: “ *\[Mosey’s\] work has influenced and enabled the adoption of FAC\-1 on our New Prisons procurement as a vehicle for the creation of a multi\-party sub\-alliance, a supply chain system for modern methods of construction and a collaborative BIM protocol*” \[H\]. 

#  Influencing practice guidance: FAC\-1 in industry 

 As a result of Mosey’s work in the construction sector and in developing the UK Government’s guidelines, the governing bodies of the construction industry have begun to move away from traditional contract models  and to advocate the use of FAC\-1 contracts. Practice guidelines across a wide range of governing organisations have changed significantly in using FAC\-1 to address problems arising from the sector’s previous reliance on fragmented two\-party appointments of consultants and contractors. 

 Guidance on how to use FAC\-1 in projects is published by the Association of Consultant Architects \(ACA\), the national professional body representing architects in private practice throughout the UK \[I\]. Constructing Excellence, a platform for industry to achieve improvements in the construction industry, also endorsed FAC\-1 in 2016 \[I\]. In addition, the Construction Leadership Council supported FAC\-1 as the medium for the construction industry to become more cost effective, including in their 2018 guidance on Procuring For Value \[J\]. 

 Arcadis’ *Global Construction Disputes Report 2020* summarised a survey of the UK construction industry and concluded that “Greater use of more collaborative standard forms of contracts, i.e. … FAC\-1, might provide more confidence in project delivery” \[K\]. 

 In September 2020, FAC\-1 was endorsed as an innovative contract that can govern programmes of work using modern methods of construction. ‘Build Homes, Build Jobs, Build Innovation’ – A Blueprint for a Housing Industrial Strategy explained how “more innovative and progressive contracts reflect earlier and closer engagement with manufacturers, for instance the ACA Framework Alliance Contract \(FAC\-1\), for long\-term strategic relationships enabling one or more clients to integrate housing programmes that are delivered through smart construction linked to separate design, construction and operation contracts” \[L\]. 

 **FAC\-1 in action: changing working practices outside the UK** 

 The FAC\-1 contract has also been accepted in several civil law jurisdictions where clients and teams wish to adopt a collaborative approach to procurement. FAC\-1 has been translated for adoption in Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Germany, Italy, Peru, Russia and Spain, and is being used by lawyers and construction professionals on projects in Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan and Spain. 

 The Liscate School project in Milan was completed in 2018 in collaboration with University of Milan using FAC\-1. Professor Valaguzza of the University praised “the success of FAC\-1 in supporting the realisation of this project on site, including the joint management of unforeseen events so as to minimise delays and additional costs” \[M\]. Additionally, University of Milan adopted FAC\-1 on a EUR655,000,000 public\-private partnership with Lendlease to create a new campus \[M\]. 

 Italian multinational energy company Enel reported: “When Enel Green Power began looking into ‘alliance contracting’ and ‘collaborative’ approaches to procurement, we quickly narrowed our focus on the work of Prof Mosey and his colleagues due to its quality, clarity and empirical support *”.* Mosey provided FAC\-1 training, which gave Enel Green Power the “knowledge and confidence to trial FAC\-1 in practice on the procurement of a wind farm project in Spain and on other pilot projects in Brazil and the USA” \[N\]. The wind farm in Spain brings to life the theme of sustainability explored in the research underpinning FAC\-1. The Spanish translation and adaptation of FAC\-1 was launched in December 2020 at online events hosted in Chile, Peru and Spain. Enel Green Power reported: “The launch of the translations and adaptations of FAC\-1 in Spain, Brazil and other jurisdictions will also assist ENEL in putting into effect our transnational collaborative procurement strategy and systems” \[N\].

We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Governments acquire much information on businesses and people. Re\-using this information for research brings substantial public benefit in the form of better health care, improved policy\-making and better services. Where the data is confidential \(for example, healthcare or tax receipts\), its value is not fully realised because governments are generally wary about re\-use. Work conducted by UWE researchers has dramatically changed the way the public sector exploits data by: 

-  changing attitudes to risk; 

-  developing statistical and management tools to improve implementation; and 

-  providing a universal framework for managing data. 

 UWE’s research has been accepted as best practice in many countries, including the UK, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and the UK, the ‘Five Safes’ framework has directly shaped primary legislation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The theory around re\-use of confidential government data for analysis has historically been very cautious, driven by fear of mistakes rather than a desire to maximise value. Research was commissioned and promoted by statistical agencies and focused on the risk of using confidential data to produce aggregate statistics such as inflation or crime figures. UWE research has developed and challenged this by: 

-  showing how different attitudes to risk around data governance can significantly affect outcomes; 

-  developing new statistical and management tools and the theory and evidence to justify them; 

-  providing a standard framework for risk management – the ‘Five Safes’. 

 **Changing attitudes – a new conceptual model**Governments are encouraged to be defensive when considering re\-use of confidential data. This leads to outcomes designed to minimise risk to the data holder. UWE research identified that this leads to sub\-optimal outcomes and inefficient decision\-making. The research recommended that: problems be considered from the user’s perspective, not the data owner’s; that credible evidence be the basis of decision making, not hypothetical ‘worst\-case scenarios’; and that governments should be ‘default open’ – using data unless there is a compelling reason against it. This leads to risk management, not minimisation, and acknowledges the wider gains to society. UWE research showed how this leads to more efficient outcomes, both in theory \( **R1, R2**\) and in applied work \( **R3, R4, R5, G1**\). 

 This radically different agenda was first presented in 2014 \( **R1**\), and has now evolved into the epistemological perspective called the EDRU \(Evidence\-based, Default\-open, Risk\-managed, User\-centred\) approach \( **G2, R5**\). This is characterised by the question “what are we trying to achieve and how do we do it best?” rather than the traditional “what are we allowed to do?” 

 The EDRU approach is less dogmatic in its approach to risk management, causing problems for the rules\-based processes used to regulate data access. The UWE team demonstrated that effective regulation is better achieved by ‘principles\-based’ regulation matched to accreditation processes, rather than rigid rules. Together, the EDRU approach to decision\-making and the principles\-based approach to objective\-setting form the ‘UWE model’. 

 **New statistical and operational tools**Before our work, almost all government research data access was based upon rules designed for the production of official statistics by organisations such as the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\). The literature was dominated by statisticians proposing technical measures to preserve confidentiality and IT literature focusing on hacking attacks. We found this was inappropriate for research purposes. As a result, UWE researchers developed tools or guidelines for all aspects of the research data process: the best way to train researchers \( **G3, G4**\); dealing with ‘impossible’ risks; anonymising datasets for research use \( **G1,** **R5**\); and cost\-effective delivery mechanisms **\(G5,** **R2**\). 

 For example, statistical disclosure control \(SDC\) is a major research field in statistics, concerned with the risk that statistical outputs may inadvertently disclose some confidential information about an individual. We were the first to demonstrate in research papers that SDC rules for official statistics are wasteful, ineffective and unsafe when applied to research outputs. An entirely new field of ‘output SDC’ was proposed which incorporated previous research as a special case. This new perspective led to new operational theory \( **R3**\) and new statistical theory \( **R4**\). 

 **The ‘Five Safes’ framework**Professor Ritchie devised the Five Safes framework as a way of describing data management choices \( **R6**\). This sees effective use of data for research as a problem of managing five dimensions: the project; the people; the setting; the data and the outputs. The Five Safes integrates statistical, ethical, managerial and behavioural perspectives into a single coherent framework that can be applied to any confidential data management problem. 

 This also helped structure research by the group. It was clear that most research in each of the Five Safes was siloed and did not follow EDRU principles. Accordingly, our research programme was developed to address the methodological and technical gaps in each of the elements. 

 Together these three elements \(conceptual model, specific tools, ‘Five Safes’ framework\) have created an integrated research programme which have changed the way that confidential data management is perceived.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Changing attitudes to risk** Prior to this research, public sector organisations paid lip service to improving data access, but in practice followed models based on a defensive methodology that discouraged innovation. 

 UWE research provided the organisations with a new conceptual framework and the research evidence to support new ways of thinking about data access. This approach is popular because it generally leads to outcomes with lower costs but better data protection and user satisfaction. 

 The broad messages of the Evidence\-based, Default\-open, Risk\-managed, User\-centred model \(EDRU\) are increasingly accepted as best practice in public sector organisations, and in international meetings on confidentiality, such as those organised by Eurostat \( **S1**\) **.** The value of the research to organisations is widely recognised. A Principal Information Development Manager at Public Health Scotland noted that: ‘ *Felix’s research has been influential in changing mind\-sets across the board’* \( **S2**\). Whilst a Data Integration Partnership manager for the Australian Bureau of Statistics \(ABS\) revealed that: 

 *‘The ABS has moved away from being a 'default closed' to a 'default open' organisation. Felix's research has allowed us to reassure the public and other government agencies that data is being handled, shared and distributed in a safe and effective way…Moving from a data\-centred to a user\-centred approach marks a considerable change in attitudes in our organisation's data focused mindset’* \( **S3**\). 

 The principles\-based approach to regulation has been increasingly influential with lawmakers. This approach underlies the GDPR, and both the UK \(the Digital Economy Act 2017\) \( **S4**\) and Australia \(2020\) have introduced primary legislation which is explicitly principles\-based and founded on UWE work: 

 *‘Our Bill is a full implementation of a principles\-based approach to data sharing…Felix’s approach has become the standard method of viewing the sharing of data in the Australian Government’* \( **S5**\). 

 **Developing statistical and operational tools**UWE researchers have trained users and managers of confidential data. We have been repeatedly commissioned by the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) and Eurostat to develop courses, and have advised statistics offices in Canada, Mexico, Germany, New Zealand and Australia. Training based on UWE’s user\-centred model has been replicated around the world \( **S3**\) and seen as an exemplar: ‘ *The training courses he’s \[Professor Felix Ritchie\] helped develop are…widely accepted as the gold standard for researchers hoping to get accreditation’* \( **S4**\). 

 Research using confidential data must be checked for confidentiality risks before being released for publication. UWE research on the statistical issues directly translates into output checking guidelines \( **S1**, **S6**\) in most OECD countries, irrespective of whether those countries use the rest of the UWE model. UWE researchers provide guidance and training to all the UK secure research facilities. UWE research into operational issues has also had a substantial impact, with principles\-based output checking being adopted across the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. 

 *‘We have similarly made amendments to our disclosure control policies in accordance with Felix’s research. We have developed check lists and procedures for both us, as outputs checkers, and for researchers to use’* \( **S2**\). 

 **Adoption of the Five Safes framework** The Five Safes is increasingly common across the world. It is particularly popular with ‘data enclaves’ \(secure facilities for more confidential data\) such as those run by the Bundesbank, the European Central Bank, Eurostat, and the statistical offices of a number of European countries, as well as in Australia \( **S7, S8**\) and New Zealand \( **S9**\). 

 In the UK, organisations such as the ONS, UKRI, NHS Digital, NHS Scotland, and Cancer Research UK, among others, all now explicitly use the Five Safes to define their data access policies. The ONS won the 2017 Cyber Security award for its implementation \( **S4**\). The Digital Economy Act 2017 means that all UK government data sharing for research is effectively required to use the Five Safes. According to the Deputy Director for Research Services and Data Access at the ONS: 

 *‘Felix’s design of the ‘Five Safes’ framework has played a hugely significant role with regards to the secure sharing of data both in the UK and across the world…Felix’s creation of the Five Safes has demystified the way data is used. One of the strengths of Felix’s research has been to take a dry and technical concept and make it accessible whilst also reassuring’* \( **S4**\). 

 The same source also noted the impact on data sharing during Covid\-19, with the Five Safes crucial in making the ONS’s weekly Covid Infection Study possible. The work with the Joint Biosecurity Centre, the sharing of ’Track and Trace’ statistics from the Department for Health and Social Care, data acquired in one place from multiple sources ‘… *all of this made possible in the context of Felix’s Five Safes’* \( **S4**\). 

 The Australian Bureau of Statistics \(ABS\) adopted the Five Safes in 2015, after being heavily criticised for their data management in 2014, and coming across the UWE research in search of a solution \( **S3**\). After its successful adoption by ABS and the Australian Department of Social Services, private sector organisations and universities in Australia increasingly used it. The 2017 government sponsored Productivity Commission report \( **S10**\) recommended wholesale adoption of the UWE model across all of government, including the Five Safes. The bill implementing this is now making its way through the Australian parliament. According to the Acting National Data Commissioner in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: 

 *‘Felix's work has formed the cornerstone of a key Australian Government reform agenda which is to be enshrined in legislation. His work has captured the attention of key decision makers, who are now familiar with the Five Safes approach. Taken together, I can give no stronger endorsement of the relevance and importance of Felix's work to us’* \( **S5**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Through his collaborations with the Royal Shakespeare Company \(RSC\), Professor Wyver’s academic and practice\-based research in creative screen adaptations of Shakespeare has had significant impacts on the activities and planning of one of the UK’s most important theatre companies, on cultural life and education for large audiences in Britain and abroad, and on the economic prosperity of the UK cultural sector, resulting in a spend of \[text removed for publication\] within the UK creative industries. Beneficiaries include: 

-  the RSC, who are able to create aesthetically and commercially successful screen productions in\-house, significantly expand their audience reach and donor relationships, and fulfil their remit as a publicly subsidised organisation; 

-  audiences of more than 1 million who gain access to acclaimed RSC performances, despite being unable to visit its theatres in Stratford\-upon\-Avon \(including during the pandemic\); 

-  around 376,000 pupils in secondary education studying literature in the UK; 

-  and future audiences, since Wyver’s adaptations are creating an archive of RSC performances of the entire First Folio for the preservation of national literary and theatrical heritage.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 From 2011\-15, Professor John Wyver was Principal Investigator for ‘Screen Plays: Theatre Plays on British Television’ at the University of Westminster, an AHRC\-funded research project that documented and critically engaged with plays originally written for the theatre that have been presented on British television. This has resulted in a publicly accessible  [database](http://bufvc.ac.uk/screenplays/) of information about 3,000\-plus productions, two conferences, three BFI Southbank screening seasons, a widely\-read  [blog](https://screenplaystv.wordpress.com/), and more than a dozen peer\-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, including those listed below. 

 A very significant element in this research was work exploring the several hundred adaptations of Shakespeare made previously for British television \[e.g. outputs 1, 2, 3\]. This led to Wyver’s monograph *Screening the Royal Shakespeare Company*, a critical history of screen adaptations of stage productions by the RSC from 1910 to the present \[output 4\]. Drawing on the BBC Written Archives, RSC archives and other private and public sources, the book traces the ways in which the RSC and its work has been presented in film, on television and in more recent screen\-based forms. Described by Sir Stanley Wells in the  [*TLS*](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/press-plays-the-thing/) as a “meticulously researched, amply documented and wonderfully wide\-ranging study”, the book details the changing importance of screen adaptations for the RSC \(and the Stratford companies that preceded it\) across more than a century and offers close readings of  mainstream film adaptations and television productions since 1951. The book was also extracted in  [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/10/a-midsummer-nights-mystery-my-search-for-peter-brook-dream-rsc) \(June 10 2019\) for a wider, non\-academic audience. 

 As Wyver argues in a 2014 peer\-reviewed article, “rather than being seen simply as ‘documentation’ and as the inferior traces of theatrical originals, these productions might more productively be regarded as doubled adaptations. That is, they can be understood as adaptations for the screen of a text … that was previously, as a staged performance, an adaptation in itself” \[3\]. Developing such findings, Wyver has since 2013 been producing his own highly innovative live\-to\-cinema broadcasts of Shakespeare performances as Director, Screen Productions for the RSC. Beginning with *Richard II* with David Tennant in November 2013, these are directly informed by his many years of research into the history of adaptations of stagings of Shakespeare’s work, as well as previous television film adaptations produced by Wyver himself for the RSC. Wyver’s creation of the broadcasts – the ‘RSC Live from Stratford\-upon\-Avon’ \[6\] – has resulted in the development of a pioneering production workflow deriving from this research that has generated innovative and creative responses to key issues in the adaptation of stage productions for the screen. Academically, this is a process that Wyver has critically explored in, for example, outputs \[5\] and \[3\], which examine the history of transmissions of previously staged performances and set these within “the context of the rapidly developing contemporary form of live cinema” that “recreates as spectacle in a social context many of the approaches and concerns of television’s adaptations of Shakespeare stagings” \[5\]. 

 As the sole creative producer for the ‘RSC Live…’ series, Wyver is responsible for all of the creative and logistical aspects of each broadcast. Wyver frames the artistic vision of each screen version, working in collaboration with both the theatre and screen directors, assembles a team of around 50 crew for each, co\-ordinates each phase of rehearsals, broadcast and post\-production, and ensures that the screen version responds to, respects the integrity of, and where appropriate extends the stage production. This process has been used in 25 live broadcasts and two “as\-live” recordings of Shakespeare stagings to date, with a further 9 adaptations planned before the end of 2023 \[6\]. These will constitute the first full cycle of First Folio productions created for the screen by any theatre company, as well as the first full cycle overseen by a single screen producer. 

 As research\-based creative practice, the ‘RSC Live…’ series is at the cutting edge of new forms of adaptation, employing the latest forms of technology while crucially relying on academic understandings and archival knowledge developed in the ‘Screen Plays’ AHRC research project, Wyver’s 2019 monograph and various peer\-reviewed articles since 2013.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  Impacts on the activities and planning of the Royal Shakespeare Company 

 Described by the CEO of Trafalgar Releasing, the main distributor of event cinema productions in the UK, as “the leading creative producer in Britain of Shakespeare performances for the screen”, Professor Wyver’s academic and practice\-based research has transformed the creative practice of the Royal Shakespeare Company in its approach to screen adaptations, benefitting it both artistically and commercially \[a\-i\]. Under his leadership, the ‘RSC Live from Stratford\-upon\-Avon’ series has become, with NTLive, one of the two most successful ‘event cinema’ projects in the UK, reaching, since 2013, a combined cinema audience of \[text removed for publication\]. The impact generated by Wyver’s research is thus an exemplary instance of the benefits of research\-led collaboration with a cultural institution in innovating new forms of artistic expression for substantial public audiences. 

 Gregory Doran, Artistic Director of the RSC, testifies that: **“John’s research and expertise has ensured that the RSC Live… adaptations have consistently respected the integrity of the stage productions in their adaptation to the screen”** \[a\-ii\]. Doran notes that this collaboration has been especially “important” to the RSC since, in his academic work, “John’s archival exploration and writing has also uncovered the ways in which this was not always the case in past engagements by the company with the film industry and television” \[a\-ii\]. As Wyver’s 2019 monograph documents \(output \[4\]\), while in the early 1960s the RSC enjoyed a productive partnership with BBC Television, from the end of that decade onwards the RSC was able only to make occasional arrangements for adaptations \(including some produced by Wyver\), in deals that allowed the company varying levels of creative control and neither ownership nor continuing revenue generation from these works. 

 Wyver’s establishment and operation of ‘RSC Live…’ has **allowed the company to produce their screened productions in\-house for the first time**. The result is that, as Doran confirms: “John’s work has facilitated the RSC now being able to … retain full creative control” over its adaptations \[a\-ii\]. “Moreover”, Doran continues, “the production processes that John has co\-ordinated has meant that the company has been able to create screen adaptations of the highest quality at a significantly lower cost than was previously the case” \[a\-ii\]. Crucially, thanks to the rights framework established by Wyver at the start of the series, which was informed by his recognition of previous problems uncovered in his research \(output \[4\]\), **the RSC is now able to commercially exploit the productions in all media in perpetuity**, subject only to agreed royalty provisions for cast and stage creatives, significantly increasing the company’s potential future income \[a\-ii\]. 

#  Increasing audiences for Shakespeare’s works 

 The artistic and commercial impact of ‘RSC Live…’ under Wyver’s leadership also underpins its **creation of a significantly expanded audience** **for the RSC** **and for Shakespeare’s work** more generally. As Doran states: “With John as producer, these recordings have opened up vital new ways of the RSC reaching wide audiences both within the United Kingdom and internationally” \[b\-i\]. The audience for a single live broadcast of a Shakespeare production by the RSC is about the same as the audience for an entire year at the Royal Shakespeare theatre in Stratford. Indeed, as the RSC’s Deputy Artistic Director Erica Whyman puts it, the “exponential reach \[is\] so great that we can change who the audience is” \[b\-ii\]. Between November 2013 and early 2020, each of the broadcasts produced by Wyver was shown in 479\-746 cinemas with a total of 18,416 screenings and audiences of \[text removed for publication\] for each production in Britain and abroad, resulting in a combined cinema audience of \[text removed for publication\]. ‘RSC Live…’ has also been widely screened in schools, via streaming services, and released on DVD and Blu\-ray \[b\-iii\]. 

 This contribution to the extension of the RSC’s audience reach has helped it to fulfil its remit as a publicly subsidised organisation and further enhance its status as one of the most creatively important and admired theatre companies globally. In Doran’s words: **“The RSC’s mission is ‘to inspire and captivate audiences and transform lives through amazing experiences of Shakespeare's plays and of great theatre.’ Under John, the RSC Live… series has been central to achieving this mission**, and as a consequence John has had a significant impact on the company’s operations both internally and in relation to its audiences” \[b\-i\]. 

 One important benefit for UK cultural life has been the preservation of a very significant part of British literary and theatre heritage and thus its availability to future generations, since the series has allowed the RSC to create a high\-quality archive of their performances of all the Folio plays. Indeed, as Doran confirms, Wyver’s “unparalleled research on the history of screen adaptations of Shakespeare stagings, which I am confident in saying he knows better than anyone”, was itself “ **instrumental in the RSC’s decision to commit to and invest in a planned series of 36 new screen adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays**”, and thus to broadcast on screen all the Folio plays for the first time anywhere in the world, and to record these for future audiences \[b\-i\]. 

 Wyver has further succeeded in contributing to the expansion of audiences for Shakespeare by his contribution to the innovative presentation of RSC performances in other formats also. To take one significant example: in April 2016, Wyver was RSC screen producer on the 2\-hour live broadcast ‘Shakespeare Live\! From the RSC’, a special event scheduled to coincide with Shakespeare’s 400<sup>th</sup> birthday, which was shown simultaneously on BBC Two and in cinemas, and then broadcast on PBS \(Public Broadcasting Service\) in the USA and other international channels \[b\-i; b\-iv\]. This major television and cinema event \(which had a spend of c.£550k within the UK creative industries\) presented extracts from Shakespeare plays mounted on stage and for the screen, and featured Helen Mirren, Judi Dench, David Tennant and Paapa Essiedu, among others, including HRH Prince Charles. The success of ‘Shakespeare Live\!’ in achieving what Tony Hall, then Director\-General of the BBC, described as “Our ambition … to **get more people excited about Shakespeare than ever before**” \[b\-v\] is demonstrated by its audience reach of \[text removed for publication\], and \[text removed for publication\] \[b\-vi; b\-vii, p.5\]. 

#  Impact on secondary school teaching and learning 

 Wyver’s research\-led adaptations have made a very significant contribution to **aiding the RSC in fulfilling its educational remit and in expanding its reach**. As Jacqui O’Hanlon, Director of Education at the RSC, writes: 

 “the RSC Live from Stratford\-upon\-Avon recordings produced by Professor John Wyver have been of considerable importance for the company’s education work over the past seven years … reaching in total around 376,000 pupils. We know from extensive feedback from teachers how much these \[free\] presentations have meant to pupils ... Teachers tell us that the Broadcasts ‘…are now a regular part of our annual curriculum.’ And schools regularly tell us that the broadcasts are having a significant impact on the engagement of low attaining children; they talk about how **accessing the broadcasts is** **extending the vocabulary of children through listening to, seeing and then using Shakespeare’s language**” \[c\-i\]. 

 For example, when “observed in a discussion with a colleague having watched the broadcast of *Julius Caesar*”, O’Hanlon reports, a Year 3 child who was “withdrawn and raised concerns relating to low self\-esteem … was transformed into a lively, vocal and happy \[pupil\] and she demonstrated her understanding … with expression and competence” \[c\-i\]. 

 Each of the RSC free Schools' Broadcasts takes place at a set time and date, with schools from all over the country logging in to a special website. BSL interpreted versions of the broadcasts are provided to make sure they are accessible to D/deaf, deafened and hard of hearing students. The broadcasts include educational activities for students and an accompanying range of Teacher Packs, as well as live Q&As with the actors \[c\-ii\]. In the words of pupils from one school: “It helps you understand the plot, because when you’re reading it it’s just words”; “You can learn from other questions that are being asked”; “It’s really helped with my GCSE” \[c\-iii\]. O’Hanlon further notes that the RSC “has also benefited enormously … in a range of other ways” from the ‘RSC Live…’ productions, including through their “acting as the focus for the collaborative creation of education materials with BBC Learning and others” \[c\-i\]. 

 As an article by Dr Taryn Storey for Learning on Screen notes, the school broadcasts are “ **the first time 87% of the children watching will have seen an RSC production, and the first time 57% of them will have seen a Shakespeare play**. 82% of schools said that as a result of the broadcast they would now consider taking children to see an RSC production in a theatre” \[c\-iv\]. As one teacher commented: the broadcasts “gave our kids the opportunity to see the RSC for the first time in their lives … \[and\] to access the creative heart of the production – instead of being outside looking in, noses pressed against the window pane, the window was opened and we felt like we were in the room” \[c\-iv\]. 

#  Impacts on the RSC’s operations and finances during the COVID\-19 lockdowns 

 At the start of the COVID\-19 lockdown in March 2020 the RSC partnered with the BBC as part of the Corporation’s ‘Culture in Quarantine’ project to make six of Wyver’s ‘RSC Live…’ productions available on BBC iPlayer, as well as via BBC Four broadcast \[d\-i\]. The choice of plays was made specifically on the basis that they were part of the current UK education curriculum, enabling continuation of the pedagogical impact described above at an especially difficult time for both teachers and learners \[d\-i\]. 

 This collaboration has significantly broadened the RSC’s audience in the UK during the pandemic. The combined audience reach of the six plays via BBC services was \[text removed for publication\] \[b\-iii\]. The initiative was also central to **ensuring that the RSC remained in touch with its audiences in the UK during the most challenging months of lockdown**. 

 The 27 productions to date have further been made available internationally on the subscription\-on\-demand \(SVOD\) services Marquee TV, BroadwayHD and Digital Theatre, and the educational SVOD service Drama Online. Revenue from sales of the productions to the BBC and from DVDs and SVOD services are shared with cast members on an agreed royalty split basis. This income has been crucial in **providing financial support for both the RSC and individuals during the COVID\-19 emergency**. 

 The RSC Development office, which raises monies from sponsorship, gifts and the like, has also been using the ‘RSC Live…’ recordings as a key part of their relationship building with patrons and donors throughout the lockdown. The previously unreleased *King John* and recording of *Timon of Athens* were, for example, screened online in a private Development Office event to around 400 Patrons and Donors. As Rebecca Preston, Development Director at the RSC, attests: 

 “the RSC Live from Stratford\-upon\-Avon recordings produced by Professor John Wyver have been of considerable importance to the Company during the Covid\-19\-enforced closure of our theatres during the past year. Prior to 2020 the RSC Live… broadcasts were already **very significant to our work in extending our relationships and our fundraising with RSC Members, Patrons, donors and stakeholders**. Since 2014 we have organised a series of successful cinema screenings of the broadcasts especially for these key supporters both in the UK and, notably, regularly in the United States with our supporters based there. Once our theatres closed last March it was essential to remain in touch with all of our audiences here and abroad, and … \[the RSC Live…\] was a vital element of this connection” \[d\-ii\]. 

#  Contributions to UK economic prosperity in the creative sector 

 Kevin Wright, Head of Commercial Development at the RSC, confirms: “Investment by the RSC in the RSC Live… series has been very significant, approximating \[text removed for publication\]. **This financing has all been spent within the creative industries in the United Kingdom**. In addition, a number of the productions have realised net profits and these funds have been shared on the agreed terms with cast members and stage creatives” \[b\-iii\]. Such spending provides vital funding for various parts of the UK creative sector, including actors, designers, stage crew and editors, as well as support services such as equipment hire companies. 

 As Wright also notes, **the RSC itself has further “benefited from significant income from exploitation of \[Wyver’s\] productions** by way of cinema screenings, sales to broadcast television, sales of DVDs and, increasingly, from revenue from streaming services. … We expect the revenue from streaming services especially to increase significantly in the coming years, greatly benefitting the company” in the future \[b\-iii\]. Gross income worldwide to the RSC, a significant employer of over 700 staff in the UK creative sector, from DVDs and streaming to end of 2020 was \[text removed for publication\] \[b\-iii\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The WHO estimates that only 10% of those who need palliative care globally actually receive it.  King’s College London research has underpinned a global shift in how palliative care is considered, defined and delivered. The research has transformed access to person\-centred palliative care beyond its origins for advanced cancer in high income countries through \(i\) identification of underserved groups and inequalities; \(ii\) development of tools to measure and manage patients’ symptoms and concerns; \(iii\) development and testing of complex interventions to reconfigure care delivery. The research has helped realign regional, national and international policies to improve access to palliative care; improved access to care for ethnically diverse groups in the UK; transformed delivery of quality palliative care in Africa; reoriented Standards of Care for people living with HIV to include person\-centred and palliative care; improved identification of symptoms and concerns for people with dementia. Much of this impact has been underpinned by the development of the Palliative Outcome Scale \(POS\) family of measures: Since the early impact described in our 2014 Impact Case Study, this work has broadened and increased its reach through implementation across diverse diseases, global regions and underserved groups. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The World Health Organisation \(WHO\) identifies palliative care as an essential health service under Universal Health Coverage. For patients and families facing serious illness, palliative care improves outcomes such as distressing symptoms, and delivers care concordant with preferences such as enabling people to die at home. For health systems, palliative care is a high\-value low\-cost intervention. Historically palliative care was mainly available for people with cancer and those in high\-income countries. King’s research has transformed access to palliative care for patients, families and health systems regardless of diagnosis or geographical location, in three steps: 

 **1. Identification of underserved groups and inequities at a population level.** Having identified a knowledge gap about palliative care for conditions other than cancer, King’s research revealed a high symptom burden for people living and dying with diverse conditions, including dementia, HIV and neurological conditions, and showed that global palliative care needs will escalate over the next decades, especially in low\- and middle\-income countries **\(1\)**. We found that people living with HIV nationally and internationally commonly experience high symptom burden and poor clinical outcomes, especially anxiety and pain. We identified the information and communication preferences of people living with HIV in the UK and Africa, and the lack of coverage of palliative care services **\(2\)**. This led to research on palliative care needs for people with TB **\(3\)**. For people with long\-term neurological conditions \(such as motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis \(MS\) and Parkinson’s disease\) King’s research identified the palliative care needs of patients and families. We found that multiple, burdensome symptoms are highly prevalent in these groups, that patients and families experience multiple losses, and that care is poorly coordinated. King’s research identified widespread and consistent disparities in relation to the receipt of end of life care among Black, Asian and ethnically diverse \(BAED\) groups, impacting on patient experience and outcomes such as fulfilling preferences for place of care and death **\(4\).** 

 **2. Measuring and managing symptom burden and concerns across physical, psychosocial and spiritual domains.** This research was underpinned by development and implementation of the King’s\-led Palliative Outcome Scale \(POS\) series of measures. The original validated POS, \(included in REF2014\) was a 10\-item measure of physical, emotional, social and spiritual concerns affecting patients living and dying with serious illness and their families. We validated a self\-report version for patients with limited literacy in sub\-Saharan Africa, and an observational version for staff to use when patients are too ill to self\-report. Since 2013, the POS has been culturally adapted and validated in different languages and underserved disease groups \(e.g. HIV, renal disease, myeloma, heart failure, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and drug\-susceptible and resistant TB\). In 2017, the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale \(IPOS\) brought together the best features from earlier versions **\(5\)**. 

 **3. Developing and testing complex interventions to reconfigure care delivery and improve outcomes**. POS formed the basis for several complex interventions to improve care and patient wellbeing. King’s developed and tested, in a randomised controlled trial, a novel approach to integrate palliative care for people living with HIV in Africa which improved patient\-reported outcomes **\(6\)**. Our further randomised controlled trial found integration of palliative care into neurology to be cost effective \(the first cost effectiveness trial in palliative care\) **\(7\)**. For people with dementia, our research found integration of IPOS for Dementia \(IPOS\-Dem\) in routine clinical care improved detection of symptoms and concerns, facilitated communication of care between care staff, family and health professionals, and supported care planning **\(8\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **King’s research has been a major contributor to a global shift in how palliative care is considered, defined and delivered.** Our academics were part of a Global Consensus Statement \(2019\) that redefined palliative care using our research on global projections of palliative care need, ensuring it is provided according to individual needs, with reducing suffering as the main goal of care, across high\- middle\- and low\-income countries **\[A\]**. Our research on global projections and palliative care for people living with HIV in low\- and middle\-income countries informed the 2020 World Health Organisation \(WHO\) Global Atlas of Palliative Care which drives the global effort to improve and monitor access **\[A2\].** All United Nations member states are, since 2012, required to provide palliative care under the WHO’s Universal Health Coverage goals; King’s research has delivered tools and interventions to help implementation and drive change. 

#  King’s research helped transform regional, national, and international policies to improve access to palliative care. 

 **1. Regional policy impact – end of life care as a priority for London.** King’s research played a key role in the decision to include End of Life Care as one of ten priority areas in the 2019 Our Vision for London, a pan\-London partnership bringing together the Greater London Authority, Public Health England \(PHE\), London Councils and the National Health Service \(NHS\) in London **\[B1\]**. The Vision seeks to improve health and care outcomes for the 8,900,000 people living across London. It includes a commitment that all Londoners in their last year of life have access to personalised care planning and support that enables them to die in their preferred place. The Clinical Director for End of Life Care, NHSE/I \(London region\) said: “I am certain that Dr Koffman and the \[King’s\] CSI team’s research evidence played a key role in engaging the London Assembly and ultimately the decision to include End of Life Care as a priority area” **\[B2, B3\]**. 

 **2. National policy impact – inclusion of King’s research in NICE guidelines **.** King’s RCT of palliative care for people with MS was the first cost\-effectiveness trial of a palliative care service in the world, and found palliative care to be cost effective. This evidence was used in NICE guidelines \(NG27, 2015\) to recommend that inpatient hospital settings should establish multi\-disciplinary palliative care teams, in addition to ensuring that people needing end\-of\-life care are offered both general and specialist palliative care services, according to their needs **\[C1,2\]**. It also informed NICE guidelines \(NG94, 2018\), recommending the option of specialist multidisciplinary community\-based palliative care for patients in the terminal phase of illness **\[C3,4\]**. Finally, King’s data underpinned PHE’s 2017 tool for cost\-effective palliative care commissioning **\[C5,6\]**. 

 **3. International policy impact – inclusion of King’s research by World Health Organisation.  King’s research on palliative care for people with multi\-drug resistant tuberculosis was used by the WHO to make recommendations on access to palliative and end of life care for all patients with multidrug resistant TB in their End TB Strategy \(2014\). This was the first time the strategy promoted access to palliative and end of life care for all patients with multidrug resistant \(MDR\) TB **\[D1\]**. King’s research informed the associated toolkit **\[D2\]** and ethics guidance **\[D3\]** to assist programme managers, policymakers and healthcare staff ensure management of multidrug resistance is based on patient need rather than prognosis. It also informed the companion handbook **\[D4\]** for public health decision\-makers, programme managers and clinical staff. Additionally, the WHO technical report ‘Selection and Use of Essential Medicines’ \(2014\) used King’s research to highlight that palliative care medicines are needed in conditions other than cancer, namely MDR TB and HIV/AIDS **\[D5\]**. This report informs the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, used by at least 154 countries to guide national and institutional lists of essential medications, and the procurement and supply of medicines in the public sector. 

 **King’s research has improved how hospices in the voluntary sector provide palliative care to people from ethnically diverse communities across the UK.** Our work on inequality of access to palliative care by ethnically diverse groups led Marie Curie, a major end of life care charity, to commission King’s researchers to write a report on palliative and end of life care for Black, Asian and ethnically diverse \(BAED\) groups in the UK **\[E1\]**. Following its publication \(2013\), Marie Curie has used the report to launch activities focused on broadening access to palliative and hospice care, and increasing the involvement of service users from BAED communities. This has led to: improved recording of data on ethnicity in clinical services \(from 40\-60% to 95%\); introduced service user feedback to drive service improvements, focusing on access, quality of care and outcomes; better assessment and meeting the communication needs of all service users through the Accessible Communication Policy and regular accessible information audits **\[E2,E3\]**; led to a new three\-year Lottery funded project to develop an evidence base to improve access to services for people from BAED backgrounds **\[E4\]**; development of a staff learning resource to ensure staff can deliver the highest quality care to terminally ill people and their families and carers from BAED communities. The CEO of Marie Curie said: “The report has been highly influential, both to our internal discussions and our strategic planning for this as a priority area. The report provided robust evidence for problems we were aware of but unable to quantify and identified issues that had not been previously considered by us. These activities have had a direct impact on the quality of services that we offer to patients and families.” **\[E5\]**. 

 **King’s research has improved palliative care for people living in Africa.** Our work to develop, validate and implement the African POS \(APOS\) was carried out with African partners, drawing on POS with an additional focus on spiritual wellbeing and self\-report for people with low literacy. APOS has impacted health care staff and services \(enabling them to holistically assess and identify priorities for patients\), and patients/caregivers \(enabling them to communicate and get help for burdensome symptoms and concerns\). APOS is used by services across Africa: a survey in 2020 by the African Palliative Care Association \(APCA, a pan\-African non\-governmental organisation\) found 44 services in 9 African countries used APOS, all of whom reported a positive impact on care **\[F\]**. Use of APOS benefits patients by making the care processes more efficient and effective, by focusing on measurable outcomes. Staff from Makarere/Mulago Palliative Care Unit Uganda said: “It enabled staff to prioritise and treat the most distressing symptoms and to give the most appropriate interventions”. Survey respondents described how this happened. APOS helps open communication between health professionals and patients/carers, enabling the latter to ‘clearly articulate what their problems are’. Its use ‘brings families on board’ so that they feel ‘like part of the care giving team by being involved in every step of care planning’. Use of APOS has helped staff improve services; one African provider said “Using a research tool has shown us that we are making a difference in outcomes for patients. \(It has\) given us reason to continue to improve our service and recognize symptoms we are not doing well on” **\[F\]**. 

 **King’s research has strengthened palliative and person\-centred care for people living with HIV in the UK.** For people living with HIV, palliative care needs were previously poorly identified and managed. Since 2007, the British HIV Association \(BHIVA\) has led on production of the UK’s National Standards of Care for People Living with HIV \(PLWH\). The Standards, which are NICE\-approved national guidelines, are critically important to everyone living with HIV in the UK, ensuring joined\-up care. In 2018, as a result of King’s research, for the first time the updated Standards of Care included both person\-centred and palliative care **\[G1\].** To ensure meaningful person\-centred care, King’s research co\-developed and tested with patient groups a person\-centred outcome measure \(POSitive outcomes\), which is now included in the Standards of Care as a measurable and auditable outcome, with a target that 90% patients complete it. The Standards of Care also include IPOS to identify palliative care needs among people living with HIV. A patient advocate who works with i\-Base and UKCAB \(NGOs that advocate for and support people living with HIV\) said: “The research…identified the things that affect the wellbeing of people living with HIV such as pain and other symptoms, and concerns such as housing, poverty, and stigma….This will help bring changes to clinical practice that can benefit all PLWH regardless of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, or age” **\[G2\]**. 

 King’s work also led to the inclusion, since 2015, of palliative care in the national audit of HIV deaths run by PHE. While initially focused on the 38,600 people living with HIV in London, since November 2019 this has expanded to a National audit to receive data on the 97,650 people living with HIV in the UK. The co\-lead for HIV surveillance at PHE said: “This has enabled us to … better care for those approaching death” **\[G3\]**. 

 **King’s research has improved the assessment of symptoms and needs in people with dementia.** IPOS\-Dem was developed by King’s from IPOS to incorporate the common symptoms and concerns of older people with multi\-morbidities and dementia. IPOS\-Dem was developed to be completed by care staff without formal clinical training using acessible language. It underwent cognitive testing to ensure that it is quick to complete, acceptable to care staff, and easy to understand and use. IPOS\-Dem addresses an important gap in the comprehensive assessment of symptoms and concerns important to people living with dementia. IPOS\-Dem empowers clinical staff to meet the palliative care needs of people with dementia, and monitor response to management strategies. An audit of 11 UK services where IPOS\-Dem is used found IPOS\-Dem facilitated patient\-centred care by increasing awareness of previously unknown problems, and through involving patients and families. It demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of using outcome measures in routine care to support assessment and management **\[H1\]**. The Dementia Lead Nurse at Trinity Hospice “Using IPOS‐Dem enables an easier and more structured identification of symptoms and problems among people with dementia” **\[H2\]**. Since its publication in 2017, teams in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Japan and Sweden are translating and validating its use in routine care across care settings e.g. care homes, hospitals **\[H\]**. 

 **Ongoing development of the POS family of measures has had a global reach and impact.** Since the REF2014 case study that described the development of POS and its early impact, this work has broadened and increased its reach across diverse disease groups and global regions. An important mechanism to ensure the global impact of POS has been the POS website \(www.pos\-pal.org\), which provides free downloadable versions of the POS, guidance on its use and links to related publications. The website has 14,871 registered users \(increased from 1,274 in 2014 REF case study\), from 150 countries \(increased from 74 in 2014\) **\[I1\]**. In the UK, IPOS is recommended as part of the Palliative Care Clinical Dataset **\[I2\]**. The renal version of POS \(POS\-S\-Renal\) was used to develop a national programme supported by NHS England and the UK Renal Registry to empower patients to take greater control of their health and wellbeing **\[I3,4\].** IPOS and IPOS\-Dem are incorporated into standards of care internationally **\[I5,6\]**. 

 **Rapid identification of symptom control needs and management of people with COVID\-19.** Early in the COVID\-19 pandemic it became clear that while palliative care was essential to the Covid response, it was missing from national and international guidelines. Our rapid research provided the first evidence of palliative care needs and response to treatment among people dying with COVID\-19, as well as recommendations for the response of palliative care and hospice services to the pandemic. We led a collaboration with the European Lung Foundation to produce factsheets for patients admitted to hospital with COVID\-19, and their families **\[J1,2\]**. These have been translated into 27 languages and downloaded >13,000 times in English and >1,000 times in other languages by patients, family members and hospitals across the NHS and globally. Feedback from patients shows that this resource has improved communication with medical teams, allaying anxiety for patients and families. Health professionals have reflected they have been an invaluable resource to meet information needs in a rapidly changing and stressful situation: “Having something to give to patients in their language has been so helpful. They can then take their time reading this and come back to us if they have any questions” **\[J3\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 An international research programme led at Leeds, over a decade, by **Professor Mark Priestley** helped to embed and strengthen disability equality across the work of the EU institutions with consequential benefits for 80 million disabled citizens. The findings enabled civil servants and politicians: \(a\) to make disability equality more visible in EU co\-ordination of Member States’ employment and social policies; \(b\) to adopt new disability equality monitoring methods and indicators; \(c\) to justify political support for new policies of mutual recognition and harmonization among the Member States, including new legislation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 More than 80 million disabled people live in the European Union and up to one quarter of the adult population say they feel in some way limited in the activities of their everyday lives. Research led at Leeds has been at the forefront in showing the EU institutions how they can challenge this exclusion by revealing disabling barriers in society and acting to remove them. 

 The impact is based on a decade\-long programme of research, as a core activity of the Centre for Disability Studies, comprising projects with a total award value above EUR10,000,000. The aim was to mainstream disability equality in EU policy making, thereby supporting commitments made in the European Disability Strategy 2010–2020 and EU efforts to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Projects were conducted for three EU institutions \(the European Commission, European Parliament and European Agency for Fundamental Rights\). 

 The main research effort stems from the establishment of an Academic Network of European Disability experts \(ANED\), under **Priestley**’s scientific directorship, from 2008 until the UK’s withdrawal from the EU in 2019. The core research team included Professors Lawson \(Leeds\), Waddington \(Maastricht\), Grammenos \(Brussels\), and Pinto \(Lisbon\), managed by Human European Consultancy \(Utrecht\) with research teams in 35 countries. This network mapped disability policies at the EU and national level, analysed disability issues thematically, made policy recommendations and developed new monitoring indicators and tools. For example: 

-  One key work package focused on the ‘European Semester’ which, since 2013, is the process by which the EU co\-ordinates core strategy among the Member States. **Priestley** led this task, commissioning annual country reports on employment and social inclusion \(from national experts\) and data reports from EU social surveys \(Grammenos\). These were analysed, along with EU and national policy documents, to produce synthesis reports and policy messages **\[1\]**. The findings showed where attention to disability was missing in the Semester process, identified areas of concern and prioritised country\-specific interventions. The evidence was provided to Commission staff to use in the policy process \(e.g. to insert selected findings in high level EU analyses and recommendations to national governments\). 

-  Projects were conducted for other EU institutions too, such as the European Parliament in 2015, in which **Priestley** analysed its role in protecting human rights under the UN Convention, and evidenced the extent of disability mainstreaming across the Parliament’s work. Through research reports and briefings, these findings showed where and how the EU institutions could give greater prominence to disability equality in their work **\[2\]**. 

-  Research on disability equality indicators was also applied in projects commissioned by the Fundamental Rights Agency, on political participation in 2013 **\[3\]** and independent living in 2016 **\[4\]**. Combined with ANED’s work on indicators supporting the European Semester, the findings demonstrated how new measures of disability equality in Europe could be conceptualised \( **Priestley**\) and operationalised \(Grammenos\), evidencing patterns of social exclusion and injustice across 28 countries and demanding attention from policy makers. 

-  The research network also undertook one\-off studies, in consultation with the European Commission, to target policy initiatives where evidence could make a difference, such as the European Pillar of Social Rights or proposals for a European Accessibility Act. For example, in a 2013 report **Priestley** demonstrated national inconsistencies in accessibility standards for common products and services \(such as banking, ticketing and public information\) **\[5\]**. Similar inconsistencies were evidenced in national disability benefit entitlements in 2016, and in disability assessment methods in 2017 \(with Waddington\) **\[6\]**. 

 In summary, the research sought to promote and to increase disability equality mainstreaming in the work of the EU institutions. It used mixed methods to equip policy makers with evidence and tools to intervene in relevant policy debates and processes. The findings revealed: 

1.  A lack of attention to disability equality in the European Semester analyses of employment and social policies \(e.g. compared to gender mainstreaming\). The research showed how the EU and its Member States could make disability equality more visible. 

1.  A lack of systematic disability equality monitoring by the EU institutions. The research showed how new data, indicators and tools could be used to remedy this. 

1.  A lack of consistency, or mutual recognition, in the rights and entitlements afforded to disabled people in EU Member States. The research evidenced a need to harmonise disability status entitlements and product accessibility standards.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact evidence shows how different EU institutions used the research to: \(a\) make disability equality more visible in the European Semester, \(b\) implement new disability equality monitoring methods and indicators, and \(c\) justify support for new policies of mutual recognition and harmonisation among the Member States, including new legislation. 

 **Mainstreaming disability equality in EU analyses of Member States’ social policies** 

 European Commission staff used the research on employment and social policies to mainstream disability equality in the European Semester \(the process co\-ordinating the Europe 2020 strategy\). 

-  They used the findings to raise disability issues in their annual Country Reports and in Recommendations to Member States. Consequently, by 2019, all 28 of their country analyses raised disability issues, twice as many as in 2012. The number of Country\-Specific Recommendation fiches referring to disability increased from three in 2012 to 18 in 2019. As a result, visibility in the EU’s high\-level Joint Employment Report also rose, from just seven references to disability in 2013 to 57 in 2019 \(increasing each year\). 

-  As the responsible civil servant affirmed, ‘ *Through mainstreaming, for the first time, we managed to make disability issues more visible in the main European policy, in Europe 2020*’ **\[A\]**. The Commission’s 2017 Progress Report on the European Disability Strategy identified this ‘ *Mainstreaming of disability issues in the European Semester process and policy publications*’ as one of its ‘Main progress’ achievements, citing the research as its evidence\-base. Its final evaluation in 2020 confirmed that *‘the European Semester has increasingly aligned its provisions with the aims of the \[Disability\] Strategy’,* because of this **\[B\]**. 

 **Adopting new monitoring mechanisms and indicators** 

 The EU institutions adopted new methods of monitoring disability equality arising from the research, either qualitative or quantitative. Three examples since 2013 evidence this. 

-  The EU statistical office \(Eurostat\) launched a disability database, including measures piloted in the research to demonstrate the feasibility of disability equality indicators in Europe \(proposed by **Priestley** and Lawson, populated by Grammenos\). In 2018 the EU Social Protection Committee adopted a disability indicator in its Social Protection Performance Monitor \(SPPM\) and Eurostat agreed to include a disability variable in all of its major social surveys. The methods shaped national disability indicators too. For example, the Danish Institute for Human Rights acknowledged in 2015 that their Gold Indicators were *‘inspired by…the proposals for Indicators of Disability Equality in Europe developed by the Academic Network of European Disability experts \(ANED\) \[and\] have also drawn inspiration from the Disability Online Tool of the Commission \(DOTCOM\) published by ANED in 2012*’ **\[C\]**. 

-  The European Parliament began to monitor disability issues in citizens’ petitions. The Petitions Committee held a televised public hearing in 2015, at which the European Ombudsman, EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, European Disability Forum, European Commission, and a member of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities were invited to respond to **Priestley**’s report **\[D\]**. A consequent Resolution of the European Parliament, drew ‘ *attention to the importance of the findings*’ and resolved that: ‘ *the Committee on Petitions continues to organise events focusing on petitions in the field of disability; calls for the capacity of the Committee on Petitions and its Secretariat to be enhanced…; calls for the establishment of a designated officer responsible for the processing of disabilities\-related issues',* and noted *'the Committee’s significant follow\-up action*' to the research **\[E\]**. 

-  The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights \(FRA\) used the indicators on political participation to frame Opinions, for example that, ‘ *EU Member States should amend national legislation depriving people of the right to vote based on a disability’* **\[F\]**. The Organization for Security and Co\-operation in Europe \(OSCE\) also referred to this research in developing new international electoral participation guidance **\[G\]**. Such Opinions added weight to existing civil rights claims by disabled people denied the right to vote. The combination of research evidence, political influence and citizens’ voice achieved significant change. For example, in the 2019 European Parliament elections, 85,000 disabled people in Germany, and 350,000 in France, gained voting rights for the first time. 

 **New policies for mutual recognition and harmonisation of rights:* 

 Finally, the research strengthened the case for new EU policy initiatives, both in soft and hard law. Two examples illustrate its impact on harmonising standards among European countries: 

-  The European Commission used the research on mutual recognition of disability benefits \(Waddington and **Priestley**\) to propose a new ‘European Disability Card’. This allows persons recognised as disabled in one country to access selected rights in reciprocating countries, without reassessment. The card was launched in eight countries in 2016, targeting access to cultural, sports and leisure services and consumer discounts. For example, Finland reported that ‘ *during the first 6 months around 5000 persons have applied for the card. We have around 150 committed partners, for example the national railway company, a nation\-wide cinema company, museums, theatres, local bus companies and many more*’ **\[H\]**. In 2020, the European Parliament called for its extension to disability benefits in all EU Member States. 

-  **Priestley**’s findings on accessibility standards were key to the Commission’s 2015 business case for a new ‘European Accessibility Act’. This EU Directive improves access for disabled people through design standards for computers and operating systems, ATMs, ticketing and check\-in machines, smartphones, digital TV equipment, television broadcasting, transport services, banking services, e\-books and e\-commerce \(regulating standards throughout the European single market and global imports to that market\). The Impact Assessment justifying this legislation contained 22 references to the research, evidencing how ‘ *differences in national legal requirements and the variety of practices used by contracting authorities, including on accessibility, constitute a barrier to cross\-border public procurement*'. Consequently, the primary case for legislation, adopted by the EU in 2019, was that, ‘ *economic operators are confronted with divergent, and often contradictory, national accessibility requirements*’ **\[I\]**. 

 In both cases, change arose from sustained lobbying by civil society but decisions required an evidential business case, in which the research proved instrumental. According to EU data, ‘ *7 in 10 Europeans believe better accessibility of products and services would very much improve the lives of people with disabilities, the elderly and others with accessibility needs*’. The market costs of divergent accessibility requirements were estimated at EUR20,000,000,000 in 2020 and the Act was estimated to reduce this by 45\-50% **\[J\]**. 

 In summary, as attested by the European Commission, ‘ *ANED has been an important resource for us. It really made an additional contribution to our work level and data collection and the intelligence that we can use as an input to policy. ANED has been instrumental to achieve the disability mainstreaming, both in policy and legal matters*’ **\[A\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University students are vulnerable to a range of security and welfare risks. However, measures taken to mitigate such risks vary widely between institutions and the higher education \(HE\) sector's approach to student wellbeing is fragmented. Research at Salford to understand, model and reframe UK university practice led to the design and development of a novel, student\-centred approach: ProtectED. This is the first Code of Practice and accreditation scheme to comprehensively address student safety, security and wellbeing. Spun out of the University as a not\-for\-profit Community Interest Company \(CIC\) in 2018, ProtectED currently enables six founder member universities to implement good practice and apply an integrated approach to safeguarding the wellbeing of approximately 165,000 students. This includes tackling sexual misconduct, reducing crime and better supporting mental health. ProtectED's award\-winning transformational, evidence\-based approach to addressing student security is recognised by the professional security sector and has impacted the thinking and work of the government regulator of the UK security industry, commercial security companies, university security professionals, and British Council HE representatives among others.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2000, Davey and Wootton’s human\-centred design research has supported practitioners and policymakers \(urban designers, planners, local authorities, police and service providers\) to gain insight into complex challenges, ‘re\-frame’ problems and develop solutions for improving crime prevention, urban safety and wellbeing **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. 

 The human\-centred approach is ‘bottom\-up’, aiming to understand the roles, requirements, abilities and limitations of the humans within a design system, be that a place, a service or a product. Insight from this process leads to improved conceptualisation of problems and in turn to the design of innovative solutions that are nevertheless feasible **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. Davey and Wootton’s design approach is detailed in their book *‘Design Against Crime’* **\[3.1\]**, published in the seminal *Design for Social Responsibility* series. The value of the approach to policy and practice across Europe is detailed in the refereed conference proceedings of the *European Academy of Design* **\[3.2\]**. 

 In 2015, Wootton and Davey initiated a collaboration with two security professionals on the improvement of security practice in higher education \(HE\). Drawing on industry networks, a panel of individuals drawn from key stakeholder organisations was established to advise, assist and inform the research and design process **\[3.3\]**. 

 Research was conducted by Marselle, Wootton and Davey across England and Wales **\[3.4, Introduction & Overview, p. 8\]**. This enabled development of a comprehensive conceptual model of the safety, security and wellbeing issues facing higher education institutions \(HEIs\), students and their parents. Findings were invited to be published by the Deutscher Präventionstag \(DPT\) — the largest crime prevention conference in Europe **\[3.3\]**. Analysis of the research revealed students are at higher risk of crime victimisation than the general population, due to a range of factors, including age, type of accommodation and life\-style. A national survey conducted in partnership with the National Union of Students \(NUS\) \(n=876\) revealed a range of mental health issues facing the 18 to 24\-year\-old age group **\[3.3\]**. Focus group research with security staff, police officers and student services staff across England and Wales revealed the fragmented and unregulated nature of service provision, with standards of safety, security and welfare services varying significantly between institutions **\[3.3\]**. The difficulty in differentiating between universities implementing good practice and those delivering poor service was evident. 

 The ProtectED membership and accreditation concept was designed to support communication of an institution's commitment to student safety, security and wellbeing, as well as improve implementation of minimum standards across the sector **\[3.3, 3.4 Introduction & Overview, p. 8\]**. Findings from qualitative focus group research challenged traditional conceptions of university security as 'manned guarding' and 'key holding', and highlighted a broader safeguarding role requiring 'softer', more interpersonal skills. University security staff are often the first to respond to student mental health issues as they usually work 24/7, including late evenings and weekends when crises are likely to occur **\[3.3, 3.4 Introduction & Overview, p. 8\]**. Indeed, security staff identified ‘student welfare’ as the second most common issue they faced and discussed providing pastoral care to students. Analysis of research findings enabled the conceptualisation and design of a holistic approach for universities to more effectively address student safety, security and wellbeing. The ProtectED concept and structure were tested through prototyping workshops with industry stakeholders \(the ProtectED Advisory Board\) and content developed and validated with subject area experts **\[3.5\]**. 

 The ProtectED Code of Practice **\[3.4\]** covers a number of issues, from core institutional security, through student wellbeing and mental health, to student harassment and sexual assault **\[3.5\]** and the student night out. Safety and wellbeing issues are considered in relation to the entire student experience, both on\- and off\-campus **\[3.4 Introduction & Overview, p. 15, 3.5\]**. Central to ProtectED is partnership working, both internally within the institution and externally with relevant agencies and partner organisations **\[3.4 Introduction & Overview, p. 14\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 ProtectED development research began in January 2015 and identified that the provision of security and student support services in UK universities is fragmented in terms of both service quality and scope. ProtectED was subsequently spun out of the University of Salford as a not\-for\-profit *Community Interest Company* \(CIC\) in October 2018 and is the **first university membership\-based HE sector accreditation scheme** to comprehensively address student safety, security and wellbeing across the whole university experience **\[see 3.4\]**. 

 Sustained by membership fees, six universities had joined as ProtectED  [Founder Member institutions](https://www.protect-ed.org/our-founder-member-universities) as of December 2020: <ins>Br</ins><ins>unel University London</ins>; <ins>Coventry University</ins>; <ins>Teesside University</ins>; <ins>University College London</ins> <ins>\(UCL\)</ins>; <ins>University of Central Lancashire</ins>; and <ins>University of Salford</ins>. ProtectED Patron, Baroness Ruth Henig, has hosted three high\-profile  [House of Lords](https://www.professionalsecurity.co.uk/news/education/protected-latest/) events to welcome ProtectED Founder Member universities and to further promote the holistic accreditation scheme. UCL, the first Russell Group university to join ProtectED, confirmed why it was supporting the scheme: *‘The safety, security and wellbeing of students is of paramount importance to us at UCL. We are proud to be a Founder Member of ProtectED, demonstrating our commitment to achieving our security objective to provide a safe and secure working environment for all students, staff and visitors’* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.1. Influencing policies and practices across the HE sector** 

 The **holistic approach** adopted by ProtectED is recognised as a **key innovation** of its Code of Practice **\[3.4, 5.2\]**. The Code details three 'Achievement Levels' for each of 187 Indicators: Required Level; \+2; and \+3. Universities must meet the minimum 'Required Level' across all indicators to achieve the *ProtectED Accredited Institution* award. Benchmarking against the Code has enabled member institutions to identify areas for improvement and resulted in the **updating and improvement of policies and practices relating to student safety, security and wellbeing** **\[5.3\]**. This has included university\-level policies in relation to emergency planning and business continuity **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. 

 Work to implement the Code has **reinforced and supported partnership working** with external stakeholders **\[5.3\]** and has also **improved cross\-departmental working** within institutions **\[5.5\]**. Founder Member Brunel University stated that the requirements of the Code ‘led to some key relationship building between the appropriate people and departments across the University’ **\[5.5\]**. Teesside University also supported this approach: ‘We can use ProtectED as a tool to show that the University is a safe place to study. It really appeals that we can develop a holistic approach under one framework’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 The <ins>British Council</ins> now uses the *ProtectED* Code to **inform training in the HE sector**, in this case structuring it around the **international 'student journey'**. Using the ProtectED Code of Practice as a guide, the British Council highlights important issues which affect international students: from selecting an UK institution, through to student experiences whilst studying at their chosen institution including pre\-arrival to the UK, arrival, international student orientation, awareness of fraudulent scams and visa compliance issues affecting study **\[5.6\]**. They advise universities to comply with the Code of Practice and **thereby reduce international students' risk of becoming victim to crime and exploitation** while studying in the UK **\[5.6\]**. As a Founder Member, Brunel University advocates use of the Code to support international students as part of an end\-to\-end process: ‘Our international marketing department loved the idea of ProtectED for how it appeals to international student concerns’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 **4.2. Changing perceptions and practices around security provision** 

 Engagement with ProtectED has enabled sharing of best practice between universities **\[5.3, 5.5\]**, as well as directly impacting **institutions' thinking and practice, particularly during COVID\-19** **\[5.3, 5.4, 5.7\]**. The holistic approach taken by ProtectED has **positively changed perceptions** around the role of university security. Based on ProtectED, institutions have **modernised their approach to university security services**, implementing mental health training for security staff, thereby enabling them to **better help students and staff in distress** **\[5.3\]**. Prior to ProtectED, security staff were not routinely trained in how to deal with such issues. As a result of the Code, the <ins>Association of University Chief Security Officers \(AUCSO\)</ins> has introduced **free Mental Health First Aid \(MHFA\) training** for its members throughout the UK, Ireland and Australia **\[5.4\]**. AUCSO’s Executive Chair confirmed that *‘this* *training has been key to improving the way higher education security officers have supported students during the Covid\-19 crisis’* **\[5.4\]**. The good practice shared around this issue of student wellbeing and mental health is also promoted by Brunel University: ‘We found that many of our students have a great deal going on in their lives, beyond the demands of studying for a university degree, and that extra support was needed in certain areas’ **\[5.5\]**. 

 ProtectED emphasises the need for ongoing performance improvement **\[text removed for publication\]**. Indeed, AUCSO maintains that ProtectED has **changed the perceptions of security staff** about their own role, with the role of a security officer in HE now more widely recognised as being about engaging with students and meeting their expectations **\[5.4\]**. The ProtectED approach has also increased consideration of **diversity in security provision**, with women now better represented within AUCSO **\[5.4\]**. ProtectED has therefore contributed to the **professionalisation of the role of security** within HE, with the scheme being recognised by professional bodies as a **reference point for good practice** **\[5.4, 5.7\]**. The Interim Chief Executive of the <ins>Security Industry Authority \(SIA\)</ins>, the UK Government regulator of the private security industry, attests to the value of ProtectED’s contribution to ‘ **improving standards in the higher education sector** where security practice is fragmented’* **\[5.7\]**. 

 **4.3. Raising standards across the wider security sector** 

 The scheme's **contribution to standards improvement has been acknowledged internationally**, with ProtectED winning the IFSEC International Security & Fire Excellence Award in 2019 for *‘Contribution to standards in the security sector’* **\[5.8\]** and a 2020 OSPA \(Outstanding Security Performance Award\) for *‘Outstanding customer service initiative’* **\[5.8\]**. Its holistic approach to student support was recognised, with ProtectED being a Finalist for the 2020 PIEoneer Student Support Awards **\[5.8\]**. 

 By evidencing the commitment of private and public sector security professionals to improving standards, ProtectED emboldened the SIA in its **recommendations on ways to improve standards in the security industry**. This has supported the SIA in its efforts to promote **better regulation and accreditation \[5.2, 5.7\]**. For example, experience in developing and prototyping the ProtectED Code resulted in the SIA introducing **improvements to its Approved Contractor Scheme \(ACS\)**, thereby reducing the time applicants spend completing forms and resulting in **improved customer satisfaction** **\[5.7\]**. ProtectED has also informed SIA strategy, with two of the SIA focus areas aligning with the Code of Practice: **the night time economy** and **safeguarding the vulnerable** **\[5.7\]**. Drawing on SIA industry expertise, the ProtectED Code of Practice further drives **cost efficiencies for institutional members** **\[5.7\]**. 

 ProtectED has additionally helped **commercial security companies better understand** and meet the needs of the HE context **\[5.2, 5.9\]**. **\[Text removed for publication\]**. Similarly, insight gained from the development of ProtectED is also enabling a <ins>security standards compliance consultancy</ins> to help **clients understand and orientate their services to the specific needs of the HE sector**, supporting it in winning business **\[5.2\]**. 

 The impact of ProtectED on commercial companies and HE institutions alike has been to **improve business processes and practices** and improve the **quality of service experienced** by their customers, university students and staff **\[5.3, 5.7, 5.9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 As described by the UN Rapporteur on the Right to Food, good food is a prerequisite for a strong market. When healthy food is not affordable or accessible to consumers, their welfare may be jeopardised, and the likelihood of poverty within society may increase. Food affordability is a key factor determining access to food, dependent not only on food cost but also on the disposable income that can be spent on food. Ulster University Business School’s \(UUBS\) research has been used to inform and support the strategic direction of non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\), public sector bodies and retailers to promote the affordability and accessibility of food to consumers, thereby tackling the wider societal challenges of reducing food insecurity and an obesogenic environment. Our research has: 

 **I1**: Informed the strategic direction of NGOs working on the global challenge of food insecurity. 

 **I2**: Stimulated policy debate on food insecurity and influenced public health messaging as priority areas requiring government action. 

 **I3**: Initiated a collaborative stakeholder approach to inform public debate on the healthiness of food retail promotions. 

 **I4**: Changed retailers’ strategies around the prominence of healthier food products to make the healthier choice the more affordable and accessible choice for consumers.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Food is a basic human right. When this right is breached it can result in food insecurity: a lack of physical and economic access to food. The role of the retailer and policy\-maker as ‘significant gatekeepers’ of our food supply must be considered to achieve a food system that is equitable for all. Maintaining the nutritional quality, value \(e.g., volume\-and price\-based promotions\) and choice \(e.g., shoppers’ decision\-making\) of the foods consumers access, at a price they can afford, is a growing concern within the UK and globally. 

 Furey and Farley **\[R1\]** explored in 2001\-2002 the issue of financial access to food and concluded that across 109 food stores, supermarket multiples were more affordable than small local convenience stores, which were typically 39% more expensive and offered reduced food choice. This study initiated a programme of research exploring inequitable food accessibility and affordability contributing to food insecurity. **R2** \(Furey\) found in 2017 that an emergency food parcel \(consumer cost GBP17.66\) does not contain all the minimum essential food items for a healthy diet, according to MacMahon and Weld \(2016\), which would cost GBP57.05, a threefold price difference.  Results from 2016\-2019 research **\[R3\]** \(Furey and Hollywood\) provided a justification, evidenced by the literature, for recommending the measurement of food insecurity within the UK by adopting the use of the US Household Food Security Severity Module as a suitable metric. 

 In 2015, competitive grant funding obtained from the Food Standards Agency \(FSA\) focused on retailer promotional offers. The results of **R4** \(Hollywood and Furey\) highlighted significant differences in the mean prices for promotional offers \(as opposed to a full basket shop\) across retailers. Using 2016\-17 data convenience store retailers offered lower average promotional prices per item \(£0.54\) and more products classified as healthy \(55.9%\), compared to supermarkets/discounters \(£0.66 and 50.7% respectively\). This study developed a bespoke ‘traffic light’ scoring system based on the FSA Front\-of\-Pack colour\-coded labelling system \(categories: red, amber and green signifying foods of low, medium and high nutritional quality respectively\) for assessing the healthiness of the promotional offers available in\-store. Results identified a similar number of products categorised as ‘red’ \(47.5%\) \(e.g., High Fat, Salt and Sugar, HFSS\) as categorised as ‘amber’ or ‘green’ \(52.5%\) and revealed the need for retailers to consider the prominence of healthy promotions within their store design \[ **R4** Hollywood and Furey\]. 

 The results of **R5** \(Hollywood and Durkin\) highlighted how a deep knowledge of the consumer can assist the food and drink industry in predicting future consumer purchasing behaviour. Subsequently in 2016, a grant was secured from The Food Safety Promotion Board \( **safe**food\) to conduct a comparable study on the consumer component \(e.g., survey and accompanied shops\) to afford better understanding of the drivers impacting on consumer choice. This study not only extended the research into a different jurisdiction, but resulted in new guidance being publicised. For example, the concept of an inverted food promotional pyramid was developed. Contrary to current healthy eating advice, where the bottom of the Food Pyramid represents proportionately more healthy food and the top of the pyramid proportionately less unhealthy food, our results found that 35% of the 69,620 food products audited were categorised at the top \(i.e., unhealthy foods\), increasing to 56% in convenience stores – see Images 1 and 2 \[ **R6**\] Furey and Hollywood\]. Using this model supports retailers and consumers alike to understand the influence of promotional offers on healthy food choices.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Ulster University Business School’s \(UUBS\) research on food policy and consumer choice continues to inform the strategic direction of NGOs, public sector bodies and retailers on the affordability and accessibility of food to the wider public. Our ground\-breaking research is the first of its kind in the UK and has been used as the independent evidence base by these stakeholders, resulting in four key impacts. 

  

 **I1**: *Informed the strategic direction of NGOs working on the global challenge of food insecurity* 

 Our research \[ **R2**\] was used by a coalition of NGOs \(e.g., Independent Food Aid Network \(IFAN\), Children in Northern Ireland \(CinNI\) and Food Foundation\) to continuously improve their collective knowledge surrounding food insecurity. First\-hand knowledge of the scale and nature of food insecurity in NI was deemed critical to policy partners given that there is a lack of UK\-wide data. Our work has particularly impacted on IFAN’s campaign work regarding food insecurity measurement. We compared three existing food insecurity indicators: *EU\-Survey on Income and Living Conditions, Food Insecurity Experience Survey and Household Food Security Scale Module \(HFSSM\)*, and confirmed agreement between the indicators, concluding the HFSSM to be the scale most comprehensible to consumers. IFAN and coalition members referred directly to our research in a key meeting on food insecurity measurement, Better Data on Food Insecurity, held by the UK’s Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) in 2019. As indicated by IFAN’s Coordinator \[ **C1**\], *“As a result of this research, the UK Government introduced a national index of food insecurity requiring its standardised measurement across all four UK nations. For the first time, via the Department for Work and Pensions’ \(DWP\), a UK\-wide annual Family Resources Survey was established that monitors household incomes and living standards. In the absence of the recent and relevant data on household food insecurity... \[Dr Furey’s\] work has provided unique detail on the scale of hunger in the UK and my colleagues and I have been able to use this data to support our call for UK\-wide food insecurity measurement”.* 

  

 Additionally, CinNI adopted our research \( **R2**\) to inform its work as the lead organisation in NI for the Children’s Future Food Inquiry \(CFFI\) which has the support of a cross\-party group of 14 parliamentarians, two all\-party Parliamentary Groups, and the Children’s Commissioners in all four UK nations. Our evidence submission and presentation were used in the development of the final report \[ **C2**\]. According to CinNI’s Policy Officer, *“The result has been continuous improvement in our knowledge surrounding food insecurity \[and\] ensured that academic research is incorporated into policy consultations and calls for policy change … The independence of the research has also been important. The rigour and professionalism has meant people do take heed of the findings and don’t dismiss as they would otherwise have done”* \[ **C2**\]. Our findings proved an *“invaluable contribution” and played “a direct role in shaping the Children’s Future Food Inquiry’s next steps, including the report”* that delivered the project’s final recommendations for tackling the problem \(Communications Manager, Food Foundation\). This culminated in a UK\-wide *Children’s Right 2 Food Charter* which has formed the foundation of ongoing calls to action around the provision of nutritious school meals/direct cash transfers during school holidays \[ **C2**\]. 

  

 **I2**: *Stimulated policy debate on food insecurity and influenced public health messaging as priority areas requiring government action* 

 Our UUBS research \[ **R2 \- R3**\] has ensured that food insecurity has attained policy attention with citations in the House of Lords Select Committee on Food, Poverty, Health and the Environment report \[ **C3**\]. Further confirmation of our thought\-leadership status in this area was an invited contribution to *The Lancet Neurology* \[ **C10**\] which stated that food insecurity is a *“new epidemic and mental health emergency”* and a publication in *The Lancet* \[ **C10**\]. **R2** and **R3** have ensured the inclusion of food access in the cross\-Departmental NI Future Food Policy as a compulsory consideration for any future policymaking in the agri\-food agenda connecting health, education, environment and economic aspects into a longer\-term, collective vision. This benefits Northern Ireland consumers by ensuring that physical and economic access to food are not barriers to healthy food. Our findings in the area of food access and food poverty in Northern Ireland have been adopted by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs \(DAERA\) confirming UUBS as the go\-to researchers in this very important policy area. As indicated by the Director of Future Food Policy, DAERA \[ **C4**\], *“UUBS research in the food poverty and policy arena has helped to inform thinking in this area of the agri\-food agenda and will continue to do so as we move forward in this inter\-departmental policy development process to further strengthen the evidence base where necessary”.* 

  

 Our research \[ **R6**\] has made a substantial contribution influencing a multi\-media national health campaign by **safe**food across the Republic of Ireland. The research was used as *“the evidence base for the ‘Transform your Trolley’ campaign”* \( **safe**food Scientific Officer, **C5**\), to raise public awareness of unhealthy food promotions, as part of a wider public health campaign to educate shoppers on how to achieve a healthy shop. The *‘Transform Your Trolley’* campaign provided shoppers with 12 tips to achieve a healthy shop with Tip \#3 *“Beware of special offers”* stating our findings that *“A third of foods on special offer aren’t that good for you so unless they are on your list, walk by”* \[ **C5**\]. Our data \[ **R6**\] were also used to visually categorise foods on promotion against the government\-endorsed healthy eating guidelines using an infographic \(images 1 and 2 in Section 2\) to teach consumers how much of what they eat overall should come from each area \(e.g., vegetables, salad and fruit\) to achieve a healthy, balanced diet. This infographic, available on the **safe**food website, which gained significant social media attention, is used as a guide for making more informed decisions about the foods they purchase \(for consumers\) and place on promotional offer \(for retailers\) \[ **C5**\]. Finally, our research \[ **R6**\] informed the basis of a **safe**food press release \[ **C5**\] that alerted media and consumers of how out\-of\-sync retailers’ promotional food offers were, when compared to the Food Pyramid. This resulted in our research being promoted across main stream media outlets in the UK and Ireland, featuring in the *Irish Independent, The Irish Times, The Irish Sun, Daily Mirror, Evening Echo, Daily Mail, Journal.ie*, *Evoke.ie* and the *UK Times.* 

  

 **I3**: *Initiated a collaborative stakeholder approach to inform public debate on the healthiness of food retail promotions* 

 Our report \[ **R4**\] highlighted the need for greater engagement between public bodies \(e.g., Food Standards Agency \[FSA\]\) and grocery retailers to tackle wider societal problems such as food affordability in a more collaborative way, leading to the inception of a bi\-annual retailer forum. This consortium, chaired by the FSA, represents UK multiples \(Tesco, Marks and Spencer, Asda\), discounters \(e.g., Lidl\) and distributors to SME retailers \(Henderson’s \[Spar/Eurospar\] and Musgrave \[Centra\]\), highlighting the reach of our research in dealing with the issue of food affordability. Since inception in 2017, the consortium has met five times to examine mutually challenging policy issues impacting on current retail practice \(e.g., possible mandatory legislation on the healthiness of promotional offers\). The Director for Research and Policy at the NI Retail Consortium \(part of the British Retail Consortium, a trade body representing 70% of UK retailers\) affirmed that our work *“led to the inception of the retailer forum with the FSA and the Department of Health which has been incomparably useful in initiating dialogue \[and\] creating better relationships between retailers and government agencies”*. He also highlighted how our research *“made a tangible difference to our thinking and engagement with Northern Ireland … in how any ongoing nutritional surveillance would be actioned, and our desire to continue to be involved in this public health conversation”*, and that it has since *“re\-visited the recommendations in light of this research to consider in our strategies and policies on nutrition, obesity, promotions and engagement with Government agencies”* \[ **C6**\]. 

  

 **I4**: *Changed retailers’ strategies around the prominence of healthier food products to make the healthier choice the more affordable, accessible and available choice for consumers* 

 Several testimonials from retailers \[ **C7 – C9**\] and a trade body representative \[ **C6**\] discussed how our research \[ **R4; R6**\] has changed the strategies used in retail practice in the following ways: 

 \(1\) The prominent placement of healthier items in\-store, for example the Supply Chain Executive from Lidl stated, *“Ulster’s research \[ **R4**\] has complemented our ‘Fresh Approach’ retailing strategy. We have improved access to healthy food by introducing ‘healthy tills’ \(e.g., the replacement of sweets\) and the increased prominence of fresh food on promotion, whereby fruit and vegetables have been relocated to the front of store”* \[ **C7**\]. 

 \(2\)  Increased the quantity and nutritional quality of foods within their offering, for example, Commercial Sales Manager for Henderson Group stated that *“Ulster’s research* \[ **R4**\] *has emphasised to us the value … of ensuring that high value product categories which can offer health benefits to consumers are the easy and affordable choice for consumers at the point of choice … EuroSpar has increased the quantity and nutritional quality of foods they choose to locate in prominent sites across its stores, and notably at store fronts where customer footfall is greatest, with healthy fresh produce and snacks more visibly and conveniently located at the front of stores, in standalone displays, and at checkout points”* \[ **C8**\]. 

 \(3\) Reduced reliance on the use of volume\-based promotions, for example, the NI Retail Consortium stated that on behalf of the industry, *“\(We\) have re\-visited the recommendations \[ **R4**\] in light of this research … \[which\] reinforces our general direction of travel including our shift away from multibuys to straight discounts”* \[ **C6**\]. 

 \(4\) Investment in healthier options through product reformulation, for example the Head of Food Innovation for Marks & Spencer stated that our research \[ **R4**\] *“influences our current thinking on how we approach marketing of HFSS and how we balance every day eating occasions with special occasions and treats. Reformulation is key to this”* \[ **C9**\]. 

  

 In summary, our research has been used by organisations with the authority to make impactful changes which benefit consumers and allow them to access healthy, more affordable food.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 LSE research in favelas has demonstrated the importance of community\-level actors to achieving United Nations \(UN\) Sustainable Development Goal \(SDG\)11 \- to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. It has had impacts at three levels: **International**: the research has changed understanding and influenced the strategic approach taken by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \(UNESCO\) to working with bottom\-up social organisations. **National**: country impacts have been felt primarily in Brazil, where the research has promoted the inclusion of under\-represented groups in policy\-making. **Community**: the research has been used by grassroots organisations to change self\-understanding, self\-esteem, and support bottom\-up social development in some of the world’s most challenging cities. Its participatory, community\-embedded nature has also built participants’ capacity to enhance inclusive urbanisation.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Stigma, violence, and social exclusion present significant barriers to UN SDG11 \- to “make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” by 2030. LSE research led by Professor Sandra Jovchelovitch has investigated institutional, social, and psychological determinants of trajectories of self and community in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro **\[1\]**. The research has shown that: i\) the competencies and skills of people living in poverty should be recognised and leveraged **\[2\]**; and ii\) as creative innovators of bottom\-up social development, local grassroots organisations are central to achieving UN SDG11 **\[3\]**. Bottom\-up social development here refers to actions conceptualised, incepted, developed, and led by members of the local community. The research draws on sociological forms of socio\-cultural psychology to theorise human development. It builds on work by Jovchelovitch on the social psychology of community and the public sphere, social representations and culture, participation, and social change \(e.g. **\[4\]**\). Key contributions are outlined below. 

 **Pioneering a participatory research partnership.** The LSE research team pioneered the first inter\-institutional, international research partnership bringing together universities and UNESCO with the charitable foundations of the Brazilian Itaú Bank and local favela NGOs \(AfroReggae and Central Unica das Favelas \(CUFA\)\). The favela NGOs held a dual role as both partners in the research and research participants. Throughout the project, from the establishment of the partnership to its multi\-method design, to its implementation and dissemination nationally and internationally, the research was co\-produced by all partners, drawing on their different expertise in multiple dialogical iterations **\[2\] \[5\]**. 

 **Improving understanding of human development and social regeneration in favela communities.** The work conceptualised the critical significance and complexity of institutional interactions for human development; it also provided new evidence about the particular institutional frameworks that shape individual and community development in the favelas **\[2\]**. To that end, it elucidated the role of the drug trade as provider, legislator, and organiser of everyday life, offering a parallel system of behavioural codes, as well as a “professional career” for youth. It also showed that favela NGOs act as “parents by proxy”, competing directly with drug gangs to provide role models and opportunities for young people. Strong social cohesion and feelings of belonging and attachment to place make the favelas places of high “sociability” \(as conceptualised by Simmel\) **\[2\]**. This was found to be both a protective factor for individuals and a driver of self and community development **\[3\]**. 

 **Systematising characteristics of** **bottom\-up models of social development used by favela organisations.** The research showed that the unique characteristics of a new type of favela\-born NGO \(of which AfroReggae and CUFA are examples\) are vital to social development, including in terms of making cities resilient and sustainable **\[1\]** **\[2\]** **\[4\]**. These organisations operate at multiple levels and hold multiple identities \- as social movements, entrepreneurs, artists, activists, and social workers. Their members are local people who share other residents’ experience of growing up in a favela community. In contrast to “mainstream” aid programmes, bottom\-up organisations do not come from outside and do not withdraw from intervention sites once their objectives have been fulfilled. They develop in, are led by, and remain in communities **\[1\] \[2\]**. They take a three\-pronged strategy involving: i\) a combined focus on the individual and the community; ii\) use of the arts and imagination to reinvent social representations of themselves, their position in the city, and their future; and iii\) action on internal city borders through everyday dislocations, increased mobility and innovative partnerships with business, government and international organisations **\[1\]**. Favela NGOs were shown to play an important role in creating positive action for change **\[2\]**, acting as a “stand\-in” for myriad institutions including the state and even the private sector, as well as the family. They support the development of skills, organise employment, and promote a new set of positive representations of the favelas, of favela\-dwellers, and of the city as a whole **\[1\] \[3\]**. 

 **Conceptual innovations:** The LSE researchers defined these provisions as “psychosocial scaffoldings” \- actions and structures supporting human development at individual and social levels **\[2\]**. Traditionally and principally associated with the nuclear family, the work showed that psychosocial scaffoldings are also provided by social institutions and NGOs, making them key sources of resilience in contexts of adversity **\[1\] \[3\]**. This has important implications both for the theoretical understanding of the sociological foundations of human development and its psychology, and for the development and implementation of social policy. The research evidence strongly supports the inclusion of bottom\-up local NGOs as partners in designing and implementing public policy supporting more inclusive cities **\[1\] \[5\]**. 

 **A toolkit for change.** Further collaborative research drew on these insights to produce a toolkit of concepts and methods for implementing bottom\-up social development **\[6\]**. Produced by LSE with UNESCO and favela organisations, it has been validated through participatory workshops in the favelas and dialogue meetings with academics, activists, and policy\-makers. It is widely used by UNESCO, governments, and grassroots organisations to build and expand bottom\-up social development in Brazil, Latin America, and beyond.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The novel research partnership described above supported sustained interactions between favela residents, NGO leaders, academic, governmental, and international organisations. Its findings leveraged the contribution of community\-level actors to making cities safe and inclusive in support of SDG11, and provided UNESCO, national governments, and favela actors with new tools to help realise this goal. The concept of psychosocial scaffoldings described in **\[2\]** is now used by both UNESCO and favela organisations to guide their interventions. Use of the toolkit **\[6\]** by UNESCO, national governments, and activists and practitioners has also generated impacts at international, national, and community levels. 

 **International impacts: supporting the development of more inclusive policies for cities**. UNESCO was a key research partner **\[2\] \[5\]**. The research has since had important conceptual impacts on the approach taken by both UNESCO and many of its partners to developing more inclusive policies for cities. The toolkit **\[6\]** has been an important mechanism for this. It has been used by UNESCO to systematically propose and incorporate bottom\-up models of social development and disenfranchised citizens’ knowledge into its own activities, including in interventions with national governments in Latin America and in UN international meetings. It is now also a key resource of UNESCO’s Inclusive Policy Lab, whose tools are used by NGOs and development practitioners around the world, as well as by UNESCO’s own staff. The toolkit is particularly used in Latin America but also, increasingly, the Middle East. Copies were published in Spanish \(500\), Portuguese \(100\), and English \(100\), alongside a  [complementary microsite](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/toolkitsocialdevelopment/view/toolkit) allowing users to access the full content online. The microsite is fully mobile\-responsive, allowing users to easily access materials from any device via the LSE and UNESCO portals. Between 2015 and 2018, it was accessed more than 10,000 times, with 2,200 full downloads from LSE Research Online **\[A\]**. According to the Director of UNESCO’s Brazil office: 

 *“…we distribute* \[the toolkit\] *in all our new partnerships with regional and municipal governments in Brazil…we use \[it\] in our relationship with NGOs, so that they can also learn and benefit from the methodology and various tools that it contains… Finally, we use it in our south\-south cooperation, with Lusophone African countries such as Angola, Mozambique, Guinea\-Bissau and Cape Verde. We translated it to Spanish and English, which allows the toolkit to travel to many other countries we collaborate with.”* **\[B\]** 

 UNESCO has also used the approach developed through the research in its  [Management of Social Transformations](https://en.unesco.org/themes/social-transformations/most) programme, which supports sustainable and effificent policy dialogue among the academic community, policy\-makers and practitioners **\[C\]**. 

 Together, the research, toolkit, and associated events have helped UNESCO establish: “ *a whole new set of international collaborations that can amplify the Brazilian experience and take it to other similar contexts of development…Many colleagues in our HQ in Paris know the work and use it with our member states, which are today 193 countries”* **\[B\]**. 

 **National impacts: more inclusive partnerships with community organisations.** UNESCO has also been proactive in applying research insights in developing partnerships with community organisations in Brazil. The concept of psychosocial scaffoldings has particularly informed changes in their understanding and approach, having: 

 *“…changed how we saw these organisations, the concept was fundamental for us to understand the relevance of the processes it refers to in the favelas and other Brazilian communities we work with…Your research influenced our work strategy with bottom\-up social organisations… \[and\] qualified our work with similar NGOs…\[It\] also influenced our project development processes for new \[private and state sector\] partners.”* **\[B\]** 

 In Brazil, changes informed by this shift in understanding include UNESCO’s use of the partnership model described in **\[2\]** and **\[5\]** to develop more inclusive networks for change: 

 *“The research… led us to take up this model of inter\-institutional partnerships… \[It\] influenced our process of developing projects with new partners in the private sector, such as…with Pretrobras for capacity\-building of NGOs, and also what we are doing now with the federal government and the Ministry for Citizenship.”* **\[B\]** 

 **Promoting the inclusion of marginalised voices in national policy**. The work has also helped to promote a new, shared understanding in Brazil of the value of incorporating citizens’ knowledge in the formulation of national governmental policy. It catalysed the inception and implementation by the Brazilian government of new, joint platforms to better include favela citizens and grassroots organisations in policy formulation and debate. 

 In September 2015, Brazil’s Department for Social Development and Fight Against Hunger \(MDS\) worked with UNESCO and the Brazilian Mission at the UN on a new policy on “Urban Poverty and Development in Brazil: the periphery at the center of the post\-2015 agenda”. This was launched at a seminar in the Economic and Social Council \(ECOSOC\) Chamber of the UN Headquarters in New York. Representatives of CUFA, one of the two favela organisations involved in the research, participated in that event and in the development of the policy, which represented an important plank of Brazil’s \(and UNESCO’s\) work towards SDG11. CUFA’s role was extended to support the inclusion of previously marginalised voices in the development of wider policy programmes. According to the then Secretary of State for Social Development and Fight Against Hunger: 

 *“We had a rich programme of collaboration and exchanges with LSE, which had real consequences for us. It led the Ministry to develop a closer relationship with strategic actors for Brazilian social development, not only at the local but also at the national level. We became active in working with them and making sure that our policies towards the SDGs… focused on the importance of having the representation of favela communities. The expansion of peripheral voices in our structures and policies was strengthened by the research; for example, we incorporated CUFA as active participants in our programme ‘Brazil without Extreme Poverty’, a massive plan of action involving 18 ministries. The research facilitated the inclusion of these peripheral actors from the favelas of our large cities in the programme of actions of the Ministry. Together we moved forward in understanding that voices and everyday life expertise are absolutely needed for inclusive social development.”* **\[D\]** 

 The wider impacts of the research on inclusive development in Brazil are acknowledged in an unsolicited letter from the then Director\-General of UNESCO. Commending the LSE partnership with UNESCO, she particularly recognises the contributions of **\[2\]** and **\[6\]** to helping “ *drive forward the values and objectives we share”* **\[E\]**. 

 **Community impacts: building capacity among community organisations.** The research has supported capacity\-building among community organisations and NGOs in Brazil in several ways, including by helping UNESCO to “ *rethink the importance of developing our policy for capacity\-building in civil society organisations”* **\[B\]**. The toolkit **\[6\]** and a blog,  [Favelas@LSE](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/favelasatlse/), provide useful stand\-alone resources in this context, but the research has also directly enhanced capacity in grassroots NGOs engaged in bottom\-up social development. Their participation provided new opportunities for these often marginalised and under\-represented groups to meet and speak to policy\-makers, urban planners, governments, and other NGOs in the global South \(and, indeed, the global North, with CUFA having subsequently established offices in New York and Madrid\). 

 It provided new forums for communication across these groups and generated a new, shared understanding of the value of incorporating citizens’ knowledge into policy formulation. CUFA’s participation in the launch of the new urban poverty and development policy \(see above\) allowed them to contribute to high\-level policy discussion in exactly the ways recommended in **\[2\]**. Their CEO, Celso Athayde, explains: “ *From the moment we have a partnership of this kind…we are seen in a different way. We start to have more power, more space to speak, and to be heard in a different way”* **\[F\]**. The policy launch event was  [recorded](https://bit.ly/2CTn0M5) and made publicly available, in part to provide a model for other governments and NGOs interested in pursuing closer collaboration. 

 According to Athayde, participation in the research: “ *gives us self\-esteem, and the partnership with these organisations… means that we are building something that is relevant and changes people’s lives”* **\[F\]**. Its provision of a co\-generated, research\-based conceptual vocabulary of their work enhances the credibility and recognition of participating organisations in ways that have supported their development of new partnerships: “ *new partners are prepared to listen to what we are saying because \[it\] has been already said and decoded through your research”* **\[F\]**. 

 The tools, opportunities, and vocabulary provided by the research were used by Athayde to set up a new organisation, Favela Holding: “ *When I started Favela Holding in 2015... I used the same tools for summoning new partners… with Globo Network…with UNESCO, with the Brazilian state at the table”* **\[F\]**. Favela Holding pulled together 25 companies to support the development of favelas and their residents; its operations now employ some 2,000 people, many of them favela\-dwellers. In 2017, Istoé Magazine \(a Brazilian weekly news magazine roughly equivalent to *Time Magazine*\) awarded Mr Athayde its Social Entrepreneur Award for his work on Favela Holdings. 

 **Enhancing awareness, understanding and wellbeing among favela inhabitants.** Favela residents who participated in the research reported significantly improved understanding and a more positive image of themselves and their neighbourhoods. In a devolution workshop with activists and favela\-dwellers, 98% of participants considered that the work had been useful to them; 91% expected to be able to use the knowledge gained from the research; and 91% reported a better understanding of their communities and themselves **\[G\]**. 

 Interviews conducted over the summer of 2019 with some of those who participated in the work suggested that this sense of enhanced understanding and wellbeing had persisted. One favela\-dweller, activist and member of staff at CUFA, reported that the research: “ *has helped us to see ourselves, to know the power we have, the mission we have…\[it\] made us grow, it gave us strength to continue without fear”* **\[H\]**. According to Athayde, this enhanced understanding has helped favela inhabitants demand more from those who should support them *, “so that both business and government understand that they cannot just give us the minimum”* **\[F\]**. A member of the Education Team at AfroReggae agrees: “ *everyone in the favela knows about the book and the toolkit, and they say: ‘this is so cool, now we are in a book\!’ Then people feel empowered, encouraged, stronger”* **\[I\]**. 

 These contributions to increased capacity and enhanced self\-esteem among research participants make an important wider contribution to the inclusivity, resilience, safety, and sustainability of the communities in which they live and work.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Deaths in prison have become a major social and political issue.  Between 2014 and October 2020, there were 598 self\-inflicted deaths and 1986 deaths overall in prisons in England and Wales \(inquest.org.uk\).  Beyond the controversial issues surrounding these deaths, there is the issue of the treatment of the families of the deceased particularly in relation to their lack of access to non\-means tested legal aid. Through his role as a trustee of the highly regarded charity INQUEST, and his own research, Professor Joe Sim has focussed on impacting on this debate through providing evidence to official inquires and Parliamentary Committees; suggesting alternative policies to prevent these deaths; supporting the families of the deceased and establishing mechanisms to hold to account those involved. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Sim’s research has focussed on health care for prisoners, which has provided the overarching framework within which his research on deaths in prison has been conducted. Since 2014, his work has increasingly focussed on the issue of prison safety and the link between the lack of safety inside prisons and self\-harm and prison deaths **\(UR 1\-5\).** This, in turn, has raised further questions about structures of democratic accountability and holding to account those involved in preventable deaths \( **UR4, UR5\)**. The narrative, which has developed in the publications below, is built around addressing these issues and has become part of the conversation with the staff at INQUEST. In other words, it is a dialectical process where ideas are exchanged between INQUEST and Professor Sim in order to develop a set of theoretical arguments, and policy prescriptions, designed to ensure that the preventable deaths that have occurred can be avoided in the future **\(UR 1, UR2, UR4**\). 

 Central to Professor Sim’s research, and the work of INQUEST, has been the demand for social justice in a landscape where social inequality prevails both inside and outside the criminal justice system **\(UR1\-5\)**. This includes the gendered experience of imprisonment **\(UR1\)** and the experiences of BAME groups who disproportionately die in the custody of the state **\(UR2\)**. The impact of Professor Sim’s work around social inequality is outlined by Dr Jamie Bennett, Deputy Director for Security, Order and Terrorism in HM Prisons and Probation Service, who said: 

 “At the heart of Professor Sim’s work is a critique of how prisons function to maintain structures of power and inequality. As well as powerful theoretical dissections, he has also been able to empirically expose this in work such as his chapter in the book Why prison?, which showed that people in prison in Liverpool and the North West came from the most deprived areas. While this is a much broader critique of social structures, Professor Sim has played a role in sensitizing prisons to these issues, which became more responsive, particularly after the landmark Social Exclusion Unit Report published in 2002, which highlighted the impact of poor housing, education and unemployment. Subsequently it has become an integral part of institutional and government policy to seek to ameliorate these impacts.” 

 The issue of social justice is reflected in the radical policy alternatives proposed by INQUEST including applying the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act to prisons and establishing a central oversight mechanism to monitor the implementation of official recommendations **\(UR 1, UR 4\).** As noted below, social justice also extends to ensuring that the subjugated voices of families are heard in the debate about deaths in custody **\(UR 4**\) and that they have equal access to legal aid. This is a central concern of INQUEST which Professor Sim has supported via his involvement in the charity’s evidence to the Ministry of Justice’s call for evidence on legal aid for inquests in 2018. This demand for ‘equality of arms’ includes not only the families of prisoners but also the families of those who died in 2017, at Grenfell. This is discussed further in Section 4 below. And while this is an ongoing issue, the charity has impacted by bringing this neglected issue into the public and political domain as a social justice issue.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As a Trustee of INQUEST since 2008, Professor Sim has used his knowledge and expertise to support with embedding research within the core aims and objectives of the charity. This includes ‘advancing education of the public by, in particular, research into and publication and dissemination of information concerning sudden or unexplained death or deaths which are or may be subject to a corners inquest’ and ‘research informed policy and parliamentary work.’ \( [INQUEST annual report 2018](https://inquest.eu.rit.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=c4adcb7d-bc0a-4666-bbc3-a186a08fbfb2)\).There are four dimensions to his impact. 

1.  **Influencing INQUEST’s Policy Work** 

 As a trustee of INQUEST, Professor Sim was, and is, heavily involved in the charity’s work across a range of areas. The charity’s impact is built around campaigning, parliamentary, policy and media work and is grounded in the day to day experience of working with bereaved people. Employing an integrated model, this brings together casework support, family participation \[and\] identification of thematic trends, statistics and analyses that feeds into the organization’s work on campaigning, information sharing and policy and parliamentary work’ \( **Source 1**\). 

 Professor Sim’s involvement in this integrated model in terms of encouraging positive policy changes is highlighted by Rebecca Roberts, the former Head of Policy at the charity.  As she notes, ‘Professor Sim made a significant contribution to our research and policy work’ and that his contribution included ‘commenting, editing and helping to shape a number of government consultation responses, parliamentary inquiry submissions and research reports’ \( **Source 2**\).  These included: Deaths in Prison: A National Scandal, 2020 \(Report\), Deaths of people following release from prison, 2019 \(Report\), Now or Never: Legal aid for inquests, 2019 \(Briefing\) and, Still Dying on the Inside: Examining deaths in women’s prisons, 2018 \(Report\). 

 He was also involved in submissions to: House of Commons Justice Select Committee inquiry on Prison Governance, 2019, House of Commons Health and Social Care Committee inquiry on Prison Healthcare, 2018, House of Commons Justice Select Committee inquiry on Transforming Rehabilitation, 2018, House of Commons Justice Select Committee inquiry on the Prison Population, 2018, House of Commons Justice Select Committee session on HMP Liverpool, 2018, and, Ministry of Justice call for evidence on legal aid for inquests, 2018. 

 He also supported INQUEST in drawing up its evidence to the Independent Review of Deaths and Serious Incidents in Police Custody chaired by Dame Elish Angiolini which was published in October 2017 and submitted his own evidence co\-authored with Dr David Baker of Coventry University and Professor Steve Tombs of the Open University. The review made a number of positive recommendations which echoed a range of concerns raised by INQUEST and bereaved families. He was also involved in helping to draft INQUEST’s briefing paper on women’s deaths in prison entitled Still Dying on the Inside which was launched on May 2nd 2018 in Parliament at an event chaired by Baroness Helena Kennedy. As noted above, he was involved in helping INQUEST submit evidence to the Health and Social Care Committee inquiry into prison health care \( **Source 3**\).  This evidence is referred to on pps 14 and 29 of the report while on page 31 the Committee noted that: 

 “Analysis by INQUEST of official data from the MoJ showed the increase in deaths post\-release \(274%\) has been far in excess of the increase in caseloads \(62%\). We share INQUEST’s concern that “there seems to be a complete absence of any form of investigation and follow\-up when something happens to somebody on post custody supervision.” 

 The report echoed INQUEST’s concerns about ‘natural’ deaths in prison and argued that ‘so\-called natural cause deaths too often reflect serious lapses in care’. The recommendations from the Committee also reflected INQUEST’s long\-running concerns around prison health care including calling for an independent review regarding the implementation of inspection recommendations, improved health screenings and access to appointments, quicker transfers to mental health settings, and clarity on measures to improve standards of healthcare more generally. This was also the first time a committee had made recommendations to address the alarming number of deaths of people after release from prison, again a major concern of INQUEST. 

1.  **Influencing Official Policy Debates** 

 In July 2015, with Professor Steve Tombs of the Open University, Professor Sim submitted evidence to the independent review conducted by Lord Toby Harris into the self\-inflicted deaths in custody of 18\-24 year olds \(The Harris Review\).  This evidence was cited in Paragraph 3.73, page 71, of the final report which noted that “In their submission to the Review, Professors Joe Sim \(Professor of Criminology, Liverpool John Moores University\) and Professor Steve Tombs \(Professor of Criminology, The Open University\) pointed out the disparity in the length of time officers are trained in England & Wales, as compared to their continental counterparts, quoting from an article published in July 2011 in Inside Times “…training for prison officers in Norway took two years, while in England and Wales it was eight weeks, which was ‘perhaps the shortest of all staff training in Europe....” \( **Source 4**\). 

 Dr Jamie Bennett, Deputy Director for Security, Order and Terrorism in HM Prisons and Probation Service, provided the following perspective, “One of Professor Sim’s most important contributions was in challenging the state of medical services in prisons, particularly in the book Medical Power in Prisons. When he started to write about this in the 1970s and 1980s, a separate Prison Medial Service was in place. By the early 2000s, this was disbanded and responsibility transferred to the National Health Service. The persistent and determined resistance of Professor Sim was an important part of the movement that saw the abolition of the Prison Medical Service. He continues to highlight the high number of people who die in prisons and the inadequacies of mental health support. This work has been part of pressure that has led to more independent scrutiny through the Prison and Probation Ombudsman” \( **Source 5**\). 

 Dr Bennett has also pointed to how Professor Sim directly engaged with practitioners via his engagement with the Prison Service Journal \(PSJ\), which he edits. and the impact on him as a senior prison manager in terms of self\-reflecting on his own everyday practices working in prisons: 

 “The fact that Professor Sim engages with practitioner publications such as PSJ, and is willing to engage in debate with people in prisons shows a personal and intellectual courage. It also shows an activist’s desire to not simply critique from the outside but to directly get into the belly of the beast. I myself can personally attest to how his work has led me to question what I do professionally and has encouraged me to challenge and change my practice”. \( **Source 5**\). 

1.  **Shaping Public Debate** 

 INQUEST casework is substantial. For example, between 1 September and 30 November 2018, the charity had 1051 new and ongoing cases. During that time, the charity sent out 35 press releases. It has always been a central feature of Professor Sim’s work with INQUEST to follow this example and disseminate his work to the widest possible official, activist and popular audiences. To that end, he has published nine single authored and one co\-authored blog since January 2018 \(S\). A central theme in the majority of these blogs is the issue of prison safety, which underpins the question of self\-harm and self\-inflicted deaths in prisons. 

 He was interviewed for the University of Sheffield’s Massive Open On\-Line Course in July 2015 on Prison Abolition \( **Source 6**\). He also took part in a documentary Injustice: A Documentary on Prisons, Crime and Us that was screened in 2017 \( [https://www.injustice\-film.com/](https://www.injustice-film.com/)\). He participated in an on\-line interview, which is part of a series entitled Critical Perspectives. A comment left by Dr David Scott said that ‘this is a brilliant interview with one of the leading critical thinkers on crime and punishment in the last four decades’ \( **Source 7**\). 

 In February 2018, he was consulted by the production company Wall to Wall for a proposed three part series for the BBC entitled History of Crime and for another series by the same production company on the history of the prison system. He was also consulted for a programme on BBC Radio 4’s File on Four, which was broadcast on 13th March 2018 on the subject of Squalid Prisons: Who’s to Blame? He was interviewed on the independent radio station, Bliss, in February 2019, which covered deaths in prison and the prison crisis more generally. In August 2020, he was interviewed by Black Lives Matter Merseyside Alliance \( **Source 7**\). 

 Overall, Professor Sim’s research has been concerned with influencing public attitudes towards, and understanding of, the criminal justice system in general, and prisons. This sentiment was alluded to in the following quote from Dr Jamie Bennett “For almost half a century, Professor Sim has been a credible, persuasive and persistent advocate of prison abolitionism. At times, this must have felt like a lonely and fruitless task. Yet this work has paid dividends. Following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis, part of the subsequent public response included more mainstream openness to radical critique, discussion of police and prison abolitionism and articulation of utopian alternatives. This has only been possible because of the long\-term work of those, such as Professor Sim, who has made a consistent stand and developed a clear intellectual foundation” \( **Source 5**\). 

 Between May 2014 to August 2020, he had 20 letters published in the Guardian, The Observer and The Times, a number of these were jointly authored with Deborah Coles, Dr David Scott and Prof. Steve Tombs. From May 2014 to August 2020, the average circulation per issue ranged between 186,931 to 109,533 for the Guardian, 143,764 to 210,308 for The Observer and 392,743 to 365,880 for The Times. Circulation figures sourced from:  [https://www.abc.org.uk/data/national\-newspapers](https://www.abc.org.uk/data/national-newspapers). 

1.  **Supporting Bereaved Families** 

 A central concern of INQUEST is to put the experiences of bereaved families at the centre of its work. This includes not only the families of prisoners who have died in the custody of the state but also the families of those who died at Hillsborough and at Grenfell.  As a trustee, Professor Sim has been involved in the debates within the charity as to how to support the families of the bereaved in these cases. 

 In terms of Grenfell, INQUEST’s casework team have been working with the bereaved and survivors, providing assistance ‘with navigating the complex issues around the Inquiry’. INQUEST has also been involved in coordinating meetings with the Grenfell INQUEST Lawyers Group who have been representing those bereaved by what happened at Grenfell. \( **Source 8**\). 

 INQUEST’s focus has been to ensure that the voices of the families have been heard. After the first phase of the inquiry, the charity convened a Family Consultation Day for the bereaved. It has also produced an evidence\-based report containing personal testimonies of bereaved families and recommendations to avoid future disasters such as Grenfell \( **Source 9**\). A bereaved family member summed up INQUEST’’s contribution: ""INQUEST is giving people who are challenged, an opportunity to regrow their wings"" \( **Source 10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Armitt, Brewster and Jones on Gothic storytelling and performance has had a significant impact on members of the public and new student audiences, fostering an improved understanding of the role Gothic continues to play in shaping our sense of place, community and the environment, including in the tourism and leisure industries. The research, whose impact has regional and national and generational reach, has increased cultural participation, improved awareness and changed the way in which the general public, older readers \(60\+\), GSCE and A\-Level students understand the resonance and relevance of Gothic in the twenty\-first century. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Armitt, Brewster and Jones’s research demonstrates that society’s ongoing fascination with Gothic narratives and ghost stories in literature, film and theatre, the tourist and leisure industries and in scientific discourse derives from their unique potential to provide narrative shape to otherwise formless but preoccupying fears/anxieties surrounding our shifting relationships to geography, community and belonging. 

 Armitt was the twentieth\-century specialist in a national six\-member team of academic researchers working with the British Library on its major exhibition ‘Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination’ \(October 2014 \- January 2015\). Armitt wrote a 10,000\-word essay, ‘Twentieth\-Century Gothic’, for the accompanying catalogue **\[3.1\]**, in which she explores how, ‘in the active pursuit of what most frightens us, we continually reshape our Gothic monsters to fit society’s changing fears’ \(150\). This work prompted the wider research question of this Case Study: to what extent does the Gothic continue to play a role in the wider management of cultural anxiety and remain *the* literature of terror? 

 Armitt’s recent work on M.R. James’s ghost stories and coastal erosion **\[3.2\]** breaks new critical ground by exploring the preponderance of Gothic metaphors used to ‘manage’ prevailing socio\-cultural anxieties relating to storm surges and climate change. Her research on ghost stories of the North Sea coastline uncovers inter\-disciplinary connections between folklore narratives of uncanny coastal predators, the historic findings of a Royal Commission and research by climate change scientists on storm surges and coastal erosion. She demonstrates that storytelling inhabits a role of equal shaping significance to those scientific narratives which measure, quantify and analyze shifting coastal and tidal patterns in these specified locales. In the process, the regionally\-based ghost story is re\-framed as a foundational discourse working alongside scientific methods, demonstrating how Gothic storytelling provides new ways of understanding the relationship between cultural anxiety and place. 

  

 Brewster’s research presents the Gothic, and the ghost story, as exploiting *and* managing concerns about place and cultural identity. He reveals how these concerns are confronted through the blending of literary and popular narratives about community and locale, as in the work of James Hogg **\[3.3\]**. Brewster has also provided new insights into the cultural importance of the ghost story, and the central role it plays in shaping relationships to place and history within different regional, national and international contexts. His co\-edited essay collection, *The Routledge Handbook to the Ghost Story* \(to which Armitt and Jones also contribute essays\), is the first comprehensive study of the different conceptions of the supernatural tale, and the social and cultural roles played by ghosts, across the world and significantly extends understanding of the ghost story tradition in the British Isles, continental Europe, the Americas, South Africa, India, South\-East Asia and Australasia **\[3.4\]**. Brewster’s individual contribution is a 5,000\-word chapter on ‘Ghost Walks’, which establishes a novel appreciation of the links between literary ghost narratives and contemporary tourism. 

 Jones’s work on contemporary Gothic drama, particularly the co\-edited collection *Contemporary Gothic Drama: Attraction, Consummation and Consumption on the Modern British Stage* **\[3.5\]** and her essay on Frankenstein, adaptation and live theatre **\[3.6\]** has brought new critical attention to the continuing theatrical currency of the Gothic, highlighting the ambivalent appeal of the public performance, and embodiment, of fear among diverse audiences. Jones’s individual contribution to her essay collection, a 9600\-word chapter on Gothic Children and Contemporary Theatrical Performance, identifies new ways of presenting young protagonists in recent stage productions.

###  3. References to the research \(indicative maximum of six references\) 

 All of the research outputs listed here were subject to rigorous peer review by the subject community. Academic reviews have endorsed the rigour, significance and originality of the research. Armitt’s chapter in *Terror and Wonder* was praised by *Romantic Textualities* for doing ‘an admirable job of contextualising and expanding’ upon its stage of the British Library exhibition. Reviewing Brewster’s *Routledge Handbook to the Ghost Story* for the Supernatural Studies Association, Aran Ruth commented that the book was ‘a welcome collection of interpretive and theoretical explorations on the topic’ and an ‘excellent’ introduction to the field. Brewster’s chapter on James Hogg was described by the *Irish Journal of Gothic and Horror Studies* as a ‘vigorous’ case study, while *The Bottle Imp* viewed it as a ‘valuable, and necessary’ contribution to scholarship.  In *Gothic Studies*, Carly Hunter calls Jones’s *Contemporary Gothic Drama* a ‘fascinating collection’, recommending it ‘to anyone seeking to learn about the Gothic's potential on and off stage’.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Armitt, Brewster and Jones’s research has led to wider public understanding of Gothic’s role in charting and navigating contemporary climates of fear. Since January 2014, this research has changed understanding in audiences, including \(a\) schoolchildren and \(b\) older readers and the general public, and brought economic and reputational benefit to organizations and businesses nationally and regionally. 

  

 **Improved understanding and awareness of Gothic for schoolchildren.** 

 **a.** **The researchers designed and delivered events and learning materials for schoolchildren, enriching their understanding of the role and importance of Gothic today.** In April 2019 Armitt was invited to write and record for the platform Massolit six online ‘mini\-lectures’ on Sarah Waters’s *The Little Stranger* for sixth\-form students \( [https://www.massolit.io/subjects/english\-literature/contemporary\-literature](https://www.massolit.io/subjects/english-literature/contemporary-literature)<ins>\)</ins>. Massolit’s founder, Chris Tudor, commented \(June 2020\) that ‘more than 3,000 schools from around the world have used our site on a free trial basis’. He confirmed that Armitt’s course ‘has had 5,667 views since it was added to the site’, and within a month of being uploaded on 10 December 2019, her viewing numbers were ‘in the top 20 per cent of all videos on the site’ **\[5.1\]** 

 Armitt, Brewster and Jones ran several events, with storytelling and the confrontation of fear at their heart, that engaged schoolchildren with Lincoln’s Gothic research. Armitt and Jones \(with PGR student Bryan\) organized a public conference, ‘Frankenstein at 200’, at the Lincoln Drill Hall on 31 October 2018, featuring public\-facing papers, a roundtable discussion with audience participation and a student\-led performance derived from Jones’s research. 50\+ people attended, including a school group from Kesteven and Sleaford High School. Unsolicited comments in The School’s Newsletter reported that the event ‘really enhanced our understanding of some of the themes and characters in Shelley’s text’, ‘was incredibly informative’ and ‘helped us broaden our knowledge contextually’ **\[5.2\]**. 

 Brewster engaged schoolchildren at the Lincoln Book Festival 2017 with a Gothic Fiction masterclass on *Frankenstein* and *Wuthering Heights* for 30 GSCE and A\-Level students and a Gothic\-themed Flash Fiction competition \(organized by Cherrell, PGR\), attracting 300\+ entries, many from primary and secondary schoolchildren. Festival Chair, Phil Hamlyn Williams, commented that the competition achieved ‘the objective of engaging a wider cross section of people in the festival…with excellent entries from Primary School and Secondary School students’ **\[5.3\]**. 

 b. **Engaging new audiences with, and changing understanding of, the Gothic.** 

 In December 2014, Armitt and Brewster gave an invited public lecture on ‘Gothic Travel and Tourism’ as part of a BL Gothic Public Study Day, linked to the ‘Terror and Wonder’ exhibition, attended by 150 people. The ‘Open Graves, Open Minds’ website said of it that ‘\[t\]heir research project on Gothic tourism struck a chord and was very topical’.  The exhibition brought economic benefit to the BL, attracting 64,460 visitors during its four\-month run, which BL noted ‘was considered a success…because we attracted a younger demographic and many first\-time visitors on that occasion’ **\[5.4\]**. The accompanying essay collection containing Armitt’s chapter on twentieth\-century Gothic sold 4,000 copies. Reviewing the collection, **London Visitors**, the official blog for Visiting London Guide.com, commented that Armitt’s chapter ‘ **offers the clearest explanation of \[Gothic’s\] appeal’** \[5.4\].** 

 Complementing the engagement with schoolchildren, Brewster’s research into the ghost story’s enduring, cross\-generational appeal underpinned a session of the Lincoln Older Readers’ Twenty\-First\-Century Literature Book Group \(with PGR student, Bevan, June 2017\) discussing Susan Hill’s *The Travelling Bag.* Participants reflected that **‘** *this was the first collection of ghost stories I have read for many years’* and ‘ *I haven’t read ghost stories since my teens’.* They observed that the session ‘ *opened my eyes to the modern relevance of ghost stories’, ‘made me think about revisiting the genre’* and *‘made me interested in finding out more about contemporary versions of ghost stories’* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Brewster’s invitation to advise on the ‘Go Gothic’ Lincoln Book Festival in September 2017 further developed audiences’ understanding of the contemporary importance of Gothic storytelling. Beforehand, Brewster was interviewed by Siren Radio about Gothic’s popularity and continuing power \(17 August 2017, 70 downloads\). During the Festival, his interview with novelist Diane Setterfield, held at The Collection, attracted 60 people. The Festival Chair acknowledged the importance of Brewster’s research to the success of the event: ‘Diane is an acclaimed Gothic author and it deepened the audience experience to have you interviewing her with the benefit of your research’ **\[5.3\]**. 

 As a result of his research on popular ghost narratives, Brewster hosted ‘A Lincoln Ghost Story’ at the White Hart Hotel on 27 November 2017, broadening appreciation of why ghost stories still matter in the twenty\-first century. The evening included talks by Brewster and the Lincoln Ghost Walk guide, and readings by Jones. It attracted a sell\-out audience of 120, resulted in extra sales of £500 for the venue and brought new customers to the alternative Lincoln Ghost Walk. One audience member observed: ‘It’s certainly made me want to learn more about ghost stories and made me question the moral teachings and reasonings behind them’.  Others acknowledged new understanding of the ghost story’s connection with Christmas \(highlighted in Brewster’s contribution\): ‘I never considered the relation to Christmas to stretch as far back as Shakespeare’ **\[5.6\]** 

 In November 2019, Brewster and Jones hosted two evenings of ‘Haunted’, featuring a talk by Brewster and performances of ghost stories, some directed by Jones, as part of the AHRC/ BA Being Human Festival hub at University of Lincoln. These events, at St Mary’s Guildhall and Lincoln Performing Arts Centre, incorporated audience participation and attracted capacity audiences \(90 in total\). Responses included: ‘It was interesting to think about how the ways in which we tell stories impacts upon our perception of them. I hadn’t thought about that before’. Other respondents learned from ‘seeing research in a theatrical setting’, reported ‘renewed interest in Gothic literature’, expressing a changed understanding and appreciation of Lincolnshire ghost tales, encouraging them to ‘look out for more’. Cate Waby, Manager/ Secretary of St Mary’s Guildhall, observed that the event ‘enabled us to open up the building to the general public and the wider community’ and helped with ‘new bookings and events’ **\[5.7\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 **Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis \(IPA\)** is a qualitative methodology for describing and understanding how individuals make sense of their personal experience that was originated by Jonathan Smith in the 1990s. In his work at Birkbeck since 2000, Smith has developed and applied the IPA methodology, and has established IPA as one of the most popular and influential methods for basic and applied qualitative psychological research. This case study documents the exceptional impact of IPA since 2014. IPA is taught widely across the UK, including in professional training, and is the method of choice for thousands of doctoral theses worldwide. It has affected applied clinical and health\-related research and practice, and has recently become an important tool for commercial consultancy and service development in healthcare and other industries.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Jonathan A. Smith introduced Interpretative \(or Interpretive\) Phenomenological Analysis \(IPA\) in the 1990s as a new methodology for qualitative research and investigation in psychology and related disciplines, and in applied clinical and social contexts \(as reviewed in \[1\]\). Since joining Birkbeck in 1999, he has developed the conceptual and methodological basis of IPA, has applied this method in numerous empirical studies, primarily in health\-related contexts, and has established IPA as one of the most widely used tools for qualitative psychological research world\-wide. He is the lead author on the seminal book on IPA \[2\], published in 2009. This book is the definitive guide to the approach, offering theoretical background, methodological guidance, samples of original research and an account of important issues. In February 2020, the book was ranked 6th in Psychological Research on Amazon, and 9th in Social Science Methodology. Smith’s personal citation record is also exceptionally high \(more than 34,000 Google Scholar citations since 2015\); the vast majority of which are to his work developing and utilising IPA. In July 2020, Smith was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the British Psychological Society in recognition of his pioneering role in establishing and enhancing the place of qualitative research in psychology. 

 IPA explores in detail participants’ personal lived experience and how participants make sense of that personal experience. It is an explicitly interpretative endeavour where the researcher aims to make sense of an individual’s own interpretation of their experiences. IPA offers a systematic and rigorous set of procedures for conducting this research. IPA has an idiographic commitment to the detailed analysis of each case in its own right, before a move to examine convergence and divergence across cases. The combination of this set of distinctive characteristics enables IPA to provide rich, compelling, nuanced and evidenced accounts of individual lived experience. 

 In addition to providing the definitive guide to IPA in 2009 \[2\], Smith has published numerous influential articles refining the theoretical and methodological framework of IPA. His highly cited review of the development of IPA provides a specific focus on its critical features \(e.g. idiographic commitment\), and describes the different levels of analysis offered by this approach \[1\]. In another highly cited article \[3\], he presented explicit criteria for evaluating the quality of IPA publications. He has also published numerous research articles where IPA was applied to understand human experience in various health and social settings, particularly in relation to the experience of pain and suffering. For example, he employed the IPA methodology to identify the complexities of understanding genetic risk in individuals considering taking genetic tests for Huntington’s Disease \[4\], to examine the psychologically debilitating impact of chronic benign back pain \[5\]; or to uncover links between alcohol consumption and concepts of masculinity in young men \[6\]. Smith has also collaborated with many other health psychologists in research projects investigating different aspects of health and disease that were funded by NIHR, the NHS, and the Department of Health, among others \[a\]. 

 During the current assessment period, IPA has grown hugely in popularity, and is now one of the best\-known qualitative approaches in psychology and the social sciences. From 2014 to 2019, Scopus shows 13,174 articles referring to IPA in the title or abstract. It is not only employed widely by academic researchers, but increasingly also in applied clinical and commercial settings. This case study demonstrates the exceptional impact of the IPA methodology during the assessment period, both within and outside academia.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This case study documents the substantial and wide impacts of IPA, as developed by Smith at Birkbeck, during the assessment period. It presents quantitative evidence to show how IPA affected teaching, research, and professional training within academia, and to demonstrate the ever growing influence of IPA in applied contexts, such as its importance for clinical and health\-related practice, and its emerging role within commercial consultancy. 

 **Impact of IPA on Teaching, Doctoral and Professional Training** 

 IPA is taught by many UK higher education institutions offering BPS\-accredited programmes in psychology at undergraduate and/or postgraduate levels, including the delivery of doctorates and accredited postgraduate degrees. IPA is employed in research on best practice in medical training at UCL, one of the UK’s largest medical schools \[Aii\]. IPA has also been widely used in doctoral research both within psychology and in other subject areas such as: management studies, social work, education and gender studies. It was referred to in the title or abstract of 1,389 UK doctoral dissertations between 2014 and 2019 \[Aiii\]. The ProQuest Theses & A.I. Database \(the largest global database of theses\) lists 2,264 doctoral theses submitted worldwide between 2014 and 2019 that refer to IPA in the title or abstract \[Aiii\]. Of these, 1,068 were conducted in the US. For example, there were 230 doctoral theses at Northeastern University and 86 theses at the Wright Institute \(a professional clinical psychology centre in Berkeley\) which explicitly refer to IPA \[Aiii\]. 

 IPA training workshops for PhD students, professional doctoral students, researchers, academics, and clinicians are regularly provided by Smith himself and by experienced IPA teachers and practitioners. They are coordinated across the 60 active national and regional IPA networks, with the central IPA website at Birkbeck as a hub \[Aiv\]. Smith ran 15 invited national and international IPA keynotes and/or workshops between 2014 and 2020 in, for example: Florida, Athens, Stockholm, Poitiers \(total attendance: approximately 1,000\) \[Av\]. Other UK\-based training events since 2014 include five workshops provided by the National Centre for Research Methods, regular IPA workshops run at Glasgow Caledonian University and \(in Ireland\) workshops at Dublin City University. IPA has also been used to develop professional training within the NHS. 

 **Applied Clinical and Health Research** 

 IPA has become an important tool for clinical and health research aimed at understanding patient experience to improve patient\-centred service provision. The guidance on research methodology provided by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust \(a pioneer in mental health services\) includes an entire section on IPA, which refers to Smith’s 2009 book and other publications by him and his group \[Bi\]. The National Institute for Health Research \(the UK’s largest health research funder\) lists 7 projects using IPA \(1 live, 6 completed\) within the assessment period \(total funding: >£6m\) \[Bii\]. The North East London NHS Foundation Trust currently sponsors a large IPA\-based psychotherapy study on the lived experience of anorexia sufferers \[Biii\]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) lists 184 pieces of research and guidance which use or cite IPA in its online evidence database for practitioners, including 23 evidence summaries provided by government and third sector organisations, such as the Institution for Research and Innovation in Social Services, Centre for Policy on Ageing, Race Equality Foundation, and the Office of the Children’s Commissioner \[Biv\]. IPA is recommended as a research method in the current NICE Clinical Guidance on Self Harm \[Bv\]. The NHS Health Research Authority website includes 315 research summaries produced from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2020 that use or cite IPA, covering topics as diverse as mothers’ experiences of breastfeeding in public, head injury, and depression \[Bvi\]. 

 **Consultancy and Commercial Applications of IPA** 

 IPA has recently become an important tool for client\-centred consultancy, where it is used to improve understanding of customer and patient experience, and to inform the development of products and services in healthcare, retail, and in financial and pharmaceutical industries. 

 *FutureCurve* is a business consultancy that uses IPA to identify customer needs for their clients. \[Ci\]. *Customer Faithful* is a research consultancy that uses their IPA\-based Lifelines<sup>TM</sup> approach as their main method for projects with clients including the NHS, Crabtree and Evelyn, Pfizer, Argos, QVC, Ingeus and DLA Piper \[Ciii\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Brighton \(UoB\) research through the Fuse cluster of collaborative research projects, including its innovation ecosystem generator *FuseBox24*, provided evidence that contributed to leveraging public investment of over GBP28,000,000 to support innovation and growth in the Creative, Digital and IT \(CDIT\) sector in the Sussex region. Joint research programmes at UoB with business partner Wired Sussex have supported 150 micro, SME and larger companies to develop and deliver new products, services and experiences, resulting in 43 new business collaborations. Access to the only business\-led 5G testbed and 5G Accelerator programme resulted in first to market advantages for 20 businesses enabling each to develop and showcase new products and services to a proof\-of\-concept phase. This research has become integral to the 5G roll\-out and the UK’s strategic development of the digital and immersive economy. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The *Brighton Fuse* project \(2011 – 2015\), led by Sapsed at the UoB, and funded by the AHRC, provided empirical evidence of arts and humanities as drivers of innovation and economic growth in the Creative, Digital and IT \(CDIT\) sector. In collaboration with Wired Sussex, the University of Sussex, and the National Centre for Universities and Business \(NCUB\), the research mapped Brighton’s cluster of CDIT businesses. The first *Fuse* report, based on a survey of 500 businesses, evidenced that 65% of the Brighton sector was fused or ‘superfused’, in that they combine creative, digital and business skills, overcoming traditional barriers between creative arts and ICT. The project found that one in three business owners who started a creative digital business had a background in the arts and humanities \[reference 3.1\]. This combination of skills evidenced growth figures almost three times as fast as businesses based on specialist skills in only one area, and ten times faster than the British economy overall. The research findings called for recognition of 'fusing' and 'superfusing' of creativity and technology as a new type of competitive ‘edge’ for business linked to innovation in management and production. The research associated this ‘edge’ with frequent and directed networking, a collaborative approach to working, a diffusion of expertise and an emphasis on creativity and innovation in business activities \[3.1\]. 

 The follow\-on *FuseBox24*, led by Professor Gillian Youngs and Wired Sussex \(2014\), was designed as a collaborative action research project supporting innovators and early\-stage start\-ups through a radical experimental 24\-week programme. This was a people\-centred programme based at the FuseBox, an incubator space in Brighton established by Wired Sussex as a result of the *Fuse* research. The research element led by Youngs, built upon and developed the *Fuse* research to explore how businesses with arts, humanities and design skills drive innovation and business creation by deploying collaborative flexible frameworks for innovation. The focus of this exploratory research was the conditions required to accelerate innovation in this sector. The findings showed that i\) CDIT innovators traded in ideas and content based on an ethos of open research and collaborative practices, ii\) as micro businesses or sole traders they needed shared spaces to collaborate, and iii\) they needed support, capability and new tools to maximise innovation. Overall, the findings showed that arts, humanities and design approaches and skills are effective in meeting these needs. *FuseBox24* piloted a research\-innovation model that drew iteratively on participant feedback, and testing a ‘toolbox’ of techniques that combined creative arts, technology and business approaches to innovation in a new fused way \[3.2\]. 

 In 2015 the *Fuse* research and the *FuseBox24* model underpinned the award of one of only three regional Innovate UK funded Catapult centres. Digital Catapult Centre Brighton \(DCCB\), is led by the Coast to Capital Local Economic Partnership \(LEP\) with Professor Karen Cham from the UoB and Wired Sussex as co\-delivery partners. The DCCB was housed at FuseBox and the proposal was underpinned by Youngs’ conceptual framework of an ‘Internet of Place’, a human\-centred perspective on the Internet of Things \[3.3\]. The Internet of Place concept integrates the novel capacities of 5G to accelerate the release of value from real time location\-based data. The focus of the DCCB was to drive local innovation by linking universities and businesses and building pre\-commercial R&D findings into market opportunities. This was in line with, and a driver for, wider policy initiatives relating to the growth of the digital economy. The innovation facilities provided as part of DCCB included high performance data analytics at UoB, with support from a Local Growth Fund, as a ‘satellite DCCB’ incubator, an immersive Lab VR/AR facility and the 5G testbed \(the first in the UK available to SMEs\) at Fusebox. These solutions leverage the capabilities of 5G connectivity, and alongside the Catapult’s 5G Accelerator and UoB’s innovation programmes \[3.10, 3.11\], support small businesses at early and scaleup stages to develop Internet of Place products and services. Thus, research and technology transfer, including creative arts and humanities skills, expanded the capacity of SMEs to innovate and develop as a joint force, and thus drive growth in the CDIT economy. 

 Since 2018 the *Digital Research & Innovation Value Accelerator* \( *DRIVA*\), a European Regional Development Fund project led by Cham, has extended the reach of the Fusebox model through a digital transformation of the innovation ecosystem’s value mechanics \[3.5\]. The DRIVA project applied Cham’s complexity and design practice\-based research to extend the innovation eco\-system and FuseBox collaborative principles into the virtual sphere. This transformed the ‘Internet of Place’ concept into digital reality in the context of the Coast to Capital LEP strategic ‘Gatwick 360’ plan that placed Gatwick Airport at the heart of an innovation eco\-system. Cham led the design and build of a live data feed out of Gatwick Airport alongside an online *DRIVA* platform, which accelerated the knowledge exchange relationships Youngs’ and Sapsed’s research found were needed to drive CDIT innovation. The system also harvested data on the profiles of the participants and their activity to provide greater quantitative insights into the earlier qualitative model \[3.4\]. Designed as a hypernetwork, the *DRIVA* platform harnessed the power of digital connectivity to enable simultaneous stakeholder engagement on individual business, collaborative partnerships and ecosystem levels \[3.5\]. The DRIVA system accelerated and extended the impact and reach of the FuseBox model, including by integrating gamification as a behavioural nudge \[3.6\].

#  4. Details of Impact 

##  4.1 Securing investment for growth and innovation in the regional digital economy 

 The *Fuse* research firmly established the role of creative arts and humanities as well as business as drivers of innovation in the digital economy and evidenced superfused individuals and clusters as crucial to the growth of the UK economy. The follow\-on research in the FuseBox represented ‘a physical manifestation of the Brighton Fuse findings’ and is a new space providing a hub in Brighton for digital innovators. The FuseBox was established by Wired Sussex, business partner in the research, and is designed to enable interactions and to support innovators to utilise knowledge and practices from the arts meshed with new technologies \[Source 5.1\]. The *FuseBox24* residency programme, which provides a platform for creative technologists to develop their innovations is based on the interdisciplinary model developed through the *FuseBox24* research and commercialised by Wired Sussex. Since 2013 the FuseBox has hosted more than thirty resident companies \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

 The *Fuse* research findings provided evidence to support the Greater Brighton City Deal flagship proposal to develop Brighton as a Tech City South \[5.3\]. The City Deal laid out an ambition to unlock more than GBP170,000,000 of investment in Greater Brighton to create 8,500 jobs and grow its technology businesses. To enable this the City Deal highlights the region’s success stories, with the *Brighton Fuse* project findings central to this case. Directly evolving from the ‘new model for superfused business’ the 2014 City Deal created a hub for Brighton’s creative\-tech cluster through a GBP24,530,000 renovation and expansion of New England House, Brighton, providing additional workspace and support for the FuseBox business incubation programme \[5.3\]. In December 2014, the Coast to Capital \(C2C\) LEP drew on data and challenges in the Fuse report to identify the CDIT sector as one of the strongest competitive advantages of the area. Under the strategic priority ‘Growth is Digital’ C2C’s business case details GBP4,350,000 in funding from multiple sources to establish the Digital Catapult Centre Brighton \(DCCB\), underpinned by Youngs’ Internet of Place framework, to invest in 5G research and establish two VR/AR labs at New England House and UoB \[5.3, 5.4\]. 

 From 2015 the DCCB, co\-led by and co\-located at the UoB and Wired Sussex/FuseBox, operated across the C2C region, covering 12 Local Authorities along the Brighton\-Gatwick\-Croydon corridor. DCCB supported innovators to unlock value from proprietary data leading to 33 new business collaborations, 27 new products, and 25 new jobs in its initial three years of operation \[5.4\]. The *Fuse* findings and the activities of the DCCB supported the development of the first and only community based 5G testbed open for commercial use, which was established within the FuseBox in 2017. Since then the 5G accelerator programme has hosted 20 companies providing first to market advantage through supported product development and testing, enabling each of them to develop and showcase new products and services to a proof\-of\-concept phase \[5.2\]. DCCB’s satellite Data Research and Innovation Lab, a high\-performance data analytics suite that enables the fast processing of ‘big data’, opened in 2019. The Lab extends the FuseBox model through a digital first platform which provides virtual access and support for businesses to utilise ‘big data’ for new business growth *.* In addition, research insights and the virtualisation of the FuseBox model via the DRIVA platform extended the reach significantly to over ten times the numbers of the previous research programmes, with 1,448 participants as at 31<sup>st</sup> Dec 2020. Use was also extended to global corporations including Vodafone, IBM, Tesco and Booking.com with international impact across Europe, Asia and the US \[5.5\]. 

##  4.2 Creating jobs, new products and enhanced business strategy in the CDIT sector 

 Data compiled by the University of Sussex on the creative sector in the C2C area show that the region generated an increase in turnover of 33% in the five years up to 2018, with over 14,000 firms in the region and the creative industries generating GBP1,550,000,000 for the local economy \[5.6\]. With an increase of 2,500 CDIT companies and 16% in salaried employees, the creative sector contributes approximately 5.1% of the C2C LEP’s Gross Value Added \- substantially higher than the national average of 3.6% \[5.6\]. These reports situate the Fuse and DCCB CDIT research as ‘ *influential studies*’ which ‘ *fed the national image of Brighton as a major UK cluster*’ \[5.6\]. The National Digital Catapult Engagement and Impact report confirms that the DCCB, working both regionally with local innovators, and as part of the broader national network, is enabling innovators to bring products and services to market, unlocking value from proprietary data to drive innovation \[5.4\]. Cumulative data from the DCCB, FuseBox/Wired Sussex and the *DRIVA* programme has been used by 150 businesses and innovators to develop and deliver new products, services and experiences, as well as in 43 new business collaborations. These include such fast\-growing businesses as MakeAmplifyl, Fracture, Naurt and Mativision \[5.2\]. For the MakerClub FuseBox24: 

 *‘had nothing less than a monumental impact on our business. Upon entering the programme, we were offered business advice and challenged on our business model in a number of ways, and we continue to think in terms of lean canvas and iterative development. One of our core tenets at MakerClub is that electronics and programming should be taught in conjunction with creativity and craft, a belief taken directly from the Fuse ethos. Without help from those directly involved in FuseBox24 as well as the network we have met as a result, I am sure we would not have been successful winning over £100k worth of grants during the last year.'* \[5.7\]. 

 Mativision, a 360\-degree video and immersive content company, engaged in the DCCB programme to increase brand awareness and expand into new sectors. The specialist 5G support provided by DCCB has influenced product design, helped Mativision position its solutions for the future, generated new business leads and built its brand awareness in new and existing markets \[5.8, 5.9\]. Additionally, CDO Partners, were a start up when they began a *FuseBox24* residency at the DCCB, and with support for lean canvas work on their business model they were able to refine and adapt it and to gain referral business of over GBP50,000 in 12 months in an entirely new sector. As a result, they were able to hire additional staff and build their capability to test out their service model, train their team and build a portfolio. By helping with analytics for FuseBox events like Talent 2017, CDO Partners increased awareness of their business through digital marketing fully supported by the Centre. In 2018/19 they had expanded to 7 staff and 400k turnover \[5.10\]. As the Founder and Director of CDO Partners LTD confirmed: ‘ *the Digital Catapult Centre provided us with a huge range of support, services and advice that we could not have found anywhere else and without it we wouldn’t be where we are now*’ \[5.10\]. 

##  4.3 Shaping regional and national strategy for the CDIT sector / digital economy 

 The CDIT sector is recognised in the C2C 2018 \- 2030 Strategic Economic Plan as a *‘world\-renowned creative and digital tech cluster*’ \[5.11\] and in the Economic Strategy for Brighton and Hove 2018 \- 2023 \[5.12\] as a ‘ *rapidly growing sector*’. The DCCB and 5G testbed, that build on UoB research, are described as ‘ *world class assets*’ and a basis from which to build local and regional capacity and strength. C2C’s strategic priority ‘Pioneer Innovation in Core Strengths’ commits to ‘ *Support the growth of immersive technologies and of 5G connectivity through the expansion of the Digital Catapult Centre Brighton’* \[5.11\]. In addition, the Brighton and Hove strategy cites the Catapult and 5G as part of the City’s track record underpinning its new approach of ‘ *embracing innovation and disruption*’ \[5.11\]. In a testimonial the Programme Manager for Strategy and Policy at the C2C has confirmed that ‘ *the University of Brighton’s research has helped to harness and support a complex diverse regional economy within the innovation CDIT ecosystem. This has helped to lay the foundation for ensuring the business sustainability of this key sector for Coast to Capital*’ \[5.11\]. 

 As part of the UK Government’s Digital Strategy, the DCCB has informed the design of the national 5G testbed. The UK Government’s National 5G strategy \(2017\) commits to working with testbeds and trials to develop, test and iterate solutions with industry users \[5.13\]. The Brighton 5G Testbed was highlighted as one of fourteen regional projects that ‘ *are helping to build the case for 5G networks as well as helping to build expertise and commitment to the digital economy amongst local areas and industry*’ \[5.14\]. To support this work, Cham, as a member of the UK5G working group for LEPs and SMEs, has advised other LEPs and informed DCMS policy on the roll\-out and adoption of 5G in the UK through UK5G \[5.13, 5.14\] At the launch of the 5G testbed in Brighton **Dr Jeremy Silver, CEO, Digital Catapult, said: ‘** *This is a major step forward in the wider roll out of this advanced technology, helping take the technology out of university labs and into the market.  5G represents more than just faster internet on the move, it \[…\] offers new companies the opportunity to control their own networks, and enables operators to manage computing at the edge as a new business model for the future*.’ \[5.14\]. Through the DCCB Brighton Dome & Brighton Festival are delivering a programme of work that will integrate 5G technology into the Brighton Dome, a well\-established 1,700\-seater, 30,000 annual visitor concert hall so that it becomes one of the first large\-scale performance, arts and cultural venues in the UK to be equipped with 5G technology \[5.14\].

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Kariya’s sociological research has had an impact in three distinct ways, which have collectively shifted the Japanese discourse surrounding education policy, in particular in terms of how Japan positions itself on the global university stage. These are: 1\) changes to policy and political debate; 2\) shifting the understanding of policies amongst leaders within the higher education sector; 3\) raising awareness of the issues affecting education policy amongst media consumers and improving journalistic reporting on the issues. All of these contributions centre on research that advocates the importance of evidence\-based policy\-making in education. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Kariya’s research provides alternative views on Japanese education policies. As a sociologist of education, he has covered the full breadth of the educational system in Japan. In recent years, his research has focused on how Japanese higher education institutions view internationalization measures differently to other HEIs in the developed world.  More specifically, he has critically assessed efforts by the Japanese government to globalise their educational institutions along Western lines. This analysis asserts that policymakers misunderstand key elements that are necessary to achieve their aims. This body of work uses sociological methods to explore tensions between state and \(broadly defined\) education policy, and emphasises the importance of evidence\-based policy\-making \( **R1**\). 

 Since 2008, Kariya has conducted discourse analysis of policy documents concerning the globalisation of university education in Japan. In particular, he has focused on the Japanese government’s ‘super\-global university’ scheme: a government\-funded initiative designed to raise the ranking positions of Japanese universities in global league tables by improving their ‘international outlook’ scores. In addition to examining policy documents, Kariya has analysed the grant proposal documents of universities that have applied for this super\-global university scheme. Finally, to contextualise why raising the global ranking positions of Japanese universities was so central to the ‘super\-global university’ policy, this research also delved into the history of successful internationalisation of universities in the UK and examined what impact the global league tables of universities created in the UK \(e.g., THE\) have had on Japanese policy makers. **\(R2, R3\)** 

 Kariya argues that analysing policies from an historical and comparative perspective is essential in understanding how to integrate Japanese university education effectively in a global context. Earlier policies had seen Japanese universities rapidly localise western knowledge into vernacular languages, which reduced the need to use English as a medium of instruction. This created a trade\-off between encouraging the use of Japanese language in teaching \(which enables more people to attend universities without strong western language skills\) and reducing strong oral communication skills in western languages. The resultant weakness of English language skills in Japanese universities has had an adverse effect on their ‘international outlook’ ranking criteria. Without this historical understanding, Kariya argues, Japanese universities will fail in setting realistic and feasible goals. \( **R2, R3, R4**\) 

 One example of the difficulties faced by universities is evident in Japanese government policy towards the employment of ‘foreign/foreign\-related faculty staff’. Kariya reveals that an insufficient supply of government funding to Japanese HEIs has made universities disinclined to hire foreign staff on tenure\-track appointments. Kariya finds that this policy has *increased* the proportion of native Japanese faculty members that are appointed: those who stayed abroad from one to three years on sabbatical leave, without obtaining overseas higher degrees, were included in the reporting, making up on average 40% of the ‘foreign/ foreign\-related staff’ across the universities taking part in this ‘super\-global’ scheme. This research demonstrates empirically that as with earlier initiatives, policy\-sceptical universities have found ways to meet the super\-global targets without increasing their financial risk. \( **R2, R5\)** 

 Kariya’s research reveals that Japanese policymakers have insufficient understanding of the reasons for the success of developed countries such as the USA, UK, and other English\-speaking countries in producing a global brand in higher education. **R2** and **R3** demonstrate that government policies have failed to fill the gap between over\-ambitious and idealistic goals and have not provided sufficient resources to meet them. It also uncovers an implicit ideology of economic nationalism behind the policies, which aims to recover the Japanese economy from long\-lasting economic stagnation by reforming university education with Western\-influenced policies that are inappropriate for Japanese conditions. 

 The analysis of Japanese education policy from an evidence\-based perspective was also evident in research published during the Covid pandemic. In 2020, the spread of Covid\-19 in Japan led policymakers to consider delaying the start of the school year from April to September. Policy\-makers argued that this would bring the Japanese school year into line with Western countries. Along with other sociologists in Japan, Kariya objectively measured the possible side effects caused by this policy change. Based on concrete evidence calculated from publicly available statistics in 47 Japanese prefectures, the research \( **R6**\) predicted the possibility of huge shortages of schoolteachers and day care services.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Shaping Japanese higher education policy** 

  

 Kariya’s research featured in discussions that took place on 14 November 2018 in the Central Council of Education of MEXT, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. This Council is the main policy\-making committee for education policy in Japan. Discussing how Japan should create its own model of higher education, one Council member stated that according to Prof. Kariya of Oxford University, the relative strengths of Japanese university education should be more critically pursued rather than just being based on models outside of Japan: 

 ‘Mr. Kariya in Oxford also said… Japan can, in a sense, be a model for most countries outside Europe, and in that sense, the United States and Europe can have a special perspective. …internationalization only at such a level as English publications, impact factor, etc. is not  harmful, but that is not the only problem I thought.’ \( **S1**\) \(translated from Japanese, citing ideas from **R2**\) 

 The citation by name of an academic, especially one based overseas, is highly unusual in Japanese policymaking circles. 

 The impact of Kariya’s research on the thinking of ministers in MEXT is also acknowledged by the former vice minister of MEXT \(Vice\-Minister from 2013\-2015\). He reflected that: 

 ‘\[Kariya’s\] work, supported by robust empirical evidence, had some impact on our policy when the MEXT’s Central Council summarised a policy report titled “Grand Design for Higher Education in 2040” \(2019\) in acknowledging the importance of pursuing our own model rather than by simply adopting western models. Specifically, his empirical research impacted on our discussions about how to reconstruct overall HEIs curricula and reorganise students learning activities’ \( **S2,** translated\). 

 **Shifting understanding in the higher education sector on globalisation issues** 

 Kariya’s research has played a significant role in how leaders in the higher education sector are approaching issues of globalization. On 27 August 2018, he was invited by the President of Tsudajuku University to deliver a keynote speech at a symposium convened by the Association of Private Universities of Japan. This is one of the largest associations of Japanese private universities with 125 members consisting of high\-ranking administrators \(predominantly presidents or vice\-presidents\).  Kariya’s speech focusing on the globalization issues at the heart of his research, enlightened discussions about the possibility of more feasible university reforms. The President of Tsudajuku University stated in the post\-conference publication that Kariya’s research \(in particular **R2**\) had changed thinking within the Association and across the sector, as she confirms in her e\-mail from September 2019: 

 ‘Top executives in private universities referred to his works on globalisation policies to understand the meaning of the \[government’s\] policies. His research, based on cogent evidence in comparisons with UK HEIS, impacted on our report on ‘How private universities can show their presence globally?’ His delivered speech made us realise defects in government higher education policies, which are made with very limited evidence for policy making.’ \( **S3**, translated\) 

 In the same email, she testifies to how the ideas set out in his book, *The warning bells from Oxford* \[ **R2**\], have been disseminated within the community of university leaders: 

 ‘Kariya provided an insightful perspective that relativizes the perception of educational power inherent in the problems of accreditation and internal quality assurance that are being promoted in Japanese universities under the guise of ‘reform’. The conference was attended by members of the above\-mentioned projects, as well as a number of senior university administrators, including presidents and vice\-chancellors, who had read the book \[ **R2**\]. The influence of the book was clearly evident here as well’ \( **S3**, translated\). 

 Universities are now taking steps to put these recommendations into practice. For example, Kariya was invited to give a keynote speech at a symposium convened by the Kyoto University Research Administrations Office, where the \(then\) President of the University attended. The symposium held on 16 March 2018 was entitled the ‘Future of Humanities and Social Sciences: How research assessment schemes can contribute to further development of research’. A total of 141 researchers and staff from inside and outside the university, as well as members of the media participated. Of these attendees, 55 were from beyond Kyoto, including from Hokkaido and Okinawa \( **S4**\) provinces. The keynote speech was based on Kariya’s research \[ **R2, R3**\], and in a discussion session after the presentation, participants, including the President, discussed the points made in the lecture. Testimony provided by the President indicates a number of subsequent reforms in his university that were influenced by Kariya’s work, especially acknowledging the importance of using academic works in Japanese for globalising their teaching: 

 ‘Inspired by Prof Kariya’s work, we designed our plan to establish ‘Kyoto International Undergraduate Program \(Kyoto IUP\)’ where we invite high school students from ASEAN \[Association of Southeast Asian Nations\] countries. In that newly established programme, launched two years ago, according to Prof. Kariya’s suggestion, we teach them Japanese language for the first half year, followed by classes taught in Japanese with Japanese students.  His ideas also inspired us to build research collaborations with Japanese companies to create innovations by taking advantage of as well as making full use of the strengths of our Japanese language and culture’. \( **S5**, translated\) 

 **Changing national reporting of education and globalization issues in the media** 

 The monograph *The warning bells from Oxford* **\[R2\]** has sold c.23,500 copies nationally in Japan, and book reviews have been published not only in academic journals but also in major newspapers and popular magazines with a significant national circulation. These publications include the Asahi Shinbun Newspaper, the second largest newspaper company in Japan with approximately 5,600,000 daily readers. Asahi Shinbun have a monthly review section of the most influential articles and books, and they refer to Kariya’s work on university education reforms on two occasions: once on 31 August 2017 and once on 15 December 2015 \( **S6a** and **S6b\).** In an e\-mail statement, an Asahi editor confirms how Kariya’s research has influenced their content production: ‘Prof Kariya’s work has provided influential views on higher education policies in Japan by relativizing our interpretations of the policies and has clarified the importance of discovering the strengths of Japanese universities in the global context’ \( **S7**, translated\).  Kariya also contributes a regular column for *Tokyo Keizai*, an equivalent of *The* *Economist* in the UK, where he often presents his research concerning issues of Japanese higher education. This popular weekly journal attracts approximately 90,000 subscribers from business, including executives in major Japanese companies. 

 The prominence of Kariya’s research in the media has directly led to changes in how the Japanese government have designed their evidence base in support of education policies. In late April 2020, the Japanese government suddenly proposed to shift the academic year to start in September \(rather than the traditional April start\) in an attempt to mitigate the impact of Covid\-19 on schoolchildren’s learning, due to the nationwide school closures in the spring of 2020. One of the cited advantages of this move was that it would bring Japan into line with Western nations’ schooling timetables. This announcement led to Kariya organising a team to explore the possible consequences of this policy \[ **R6\]**. The government had not publicly outlined any potentially adverse effects of this change, so as a counterpoint, Kariya’s research was widely reported in major national newspapers. One article in Asahi reported on its front page: ‘If Japan shifted to an academic year starting in September next year, it would face a shortage of 28,000 elementary school teachers and cost local governments close to an additional JPY300,000,000,000 \(USD2,800,000,000\) in the first year, according to a study conducted by a group of seven experts led by Takehiko Kariya, professor in the Sociology of Japanese Society at Oxford University’ \( **S8**, translated\). These newspaper articles became a ‘ *game\-changer*’ in the policy debates \(according to an Asahi article from 4 June 2020\) by providing cogent empirical results to predict the side effects that this hasty policy change might cause \( **S9,** translated\). 

 In early June 2020, the government decided to postpone the policy without clarifying when this would be readdressed, suggesting, in the Japanese political context, that they are no longer planning to implement the proposed policy in the near future. Having seen some of his earlier media work in *Tokyo Keizai*, the Japanese Cabinet Office \(and the Minister responsible for the Covid\-19 response\) invited Kariya to present his research. Presenting his analysis of a Cabinet Office survey undertaken in June 2020, Kariya argued that in order to have a full picture of the potential effect of a September start date on schools, different layers of data \(from individual schools and municipality levels\) needed to be collected in order to create a panel data set. In response, the Cabinet Office ordered a second survey, which was conducted and published in December 2020. Kariya’s influence on the government’s decision was confirmed by a Cabinet Office official whilst the survey was being prepared for publication: 

 ‘According to \[Kariya’s\] suggestion, the Cabinet office has recently conducted the second Survey on the same issue in December 2020, in which the second survey data will be connected to the previous one as much as possible to achieve a panel data design’ \( **S10**, translated\). 

 Kariya’s media work has therefore directly led to an improvement in the government’s ability to make future policy decisions based on the strongest possible evidence base.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Globally, support for recovery after stroke is substandard. Insights from our original research on priority areas for improving post\-stroke recovery have been instrumental for the development of novel educational resources on vision rehabilitation and secondary stroke prevention \(including physical activity and sedentary behaviour\) for service users and providers in stroke rehabilitation and recovery support. These new resources, used by over 20,000 service users in 134 countries and completed by over 3,100 service providers within the UK and abroad \(including Ireland, Australia, New Zealand\), have raised educational standards and enabled the development of innovative, evidence\-based stroke rehabilitation and recovery support services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research focuses on evidence gaps, prioritised through the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership on Life after Stroke, led by Pollock and Davis, i.e. vision rehabilitation and secondary stroke prevention. 

 Interventions for visual problems were investigated by Pollock and Hazelton in the first high quality Cochrane systematic review evidence synthesis on the topic \[R1, G1\]. It demonstrated that specific eye movement training was a promising intervention and could improve stroke survivors’ quality of life \- but existing clinical practice did not reflect the available evidence \[R2\]. Pollock, Hazelton and Brady conducted the first nation\-wide survey \(with a response rate of 90%\) of treatments for stroke\-related visual problems in 2011 \[R2\]. They identified important gaps and variations in care across Scottish inpatient clinical settings and key barriers to evidence\-based practice, particularly a lack of training, guidelines and pathways. 

 Secondary prevention lifestyle interventions after stroke were investigated by Lawrence et al. in their 2015 systematic review and meta\-analysis \[R3, G2\]. Using Cochrane methodology, this high quality review highlighted that these interventions improved lifestyle behaviours and physiological outcomes. In particular, behavioural interventions reduced blood pressure, waist circumference and increased compliance with medication \(anti\-thrombotics, statins\), thereby significantly reducing the odds of subsequent cardiac events. An accompanying qualitative review \[R4, G2\] highlighted important benefits of group\-based secondary prevention interventions from the perspectives of stroke survivors and family members: feeling supported by others, acquiring new knowledge, and gaining confidence. This breakthrough in understanding provided new insights into how self\-management of secondary stroke prevention by people affected by stroke could be optimised. 

 Further research on lifestyle interventions focused on physical activity and sedentary behaviour; the systematic review by van Wijck et al. in 2013 \[R5\] on physical activity was the first to comprehensively investigate stroke survivors’ perceptions on psychosocial, physical and environmental barriers and facilitators to physical activity, following robust methodology. Findings highlighted that stroke\-specific concerns \(e.g. fear of subsequent stroke, post\-stroke fatigue, embarrassment in a gym environment\), lack of motivation \(e.g. through depression, anxiety\) and environmental factors were the main barriers, and that social support and the desire to get back to valued activities were the most important facilitators to post\-stroke physical activity. These insights were essential for the development of specialist educational resources to better engage stroke survivors in physical activity. Sedentary behaviour, independently associated with high mortality and morbidity, was investigated by Tieges, van Wijck and Chastin in 2015 \[R6, G3\]. Utilising state\-of\-the\-art objective activity monitoring, it investigated behaviour patterns in the largest cohort and longest follow\-up period \(i.e. one year\) of studies published at the time. A key finding was that sedentary behaviour was independent of stroke survivors’ mobility levels and did not improve spontaneously – even in those able to walk independently. These surprising new findings highlighted the need to develop novel behaviour change interventions specifically to reduce sedentary behaviour after stroke. 

 Taken together, insights from this body of work were instrumental for designing novel, evidence\-based educational resources and services to address important evidence gaps affecting service users and providers.

This review, part of a suite of four Cochrane systematic reviews addressing visual problems in stroke, was the first to systematically identify, appraise and meta\-analyse the data relating to interventions for this population, addressing an important gap in the literature – a gap, known to be a barrier to clinicians’ ability to provide evidence\-based care. Using Cochrane methods, internationally known for their rigour, this review has been used to underpin national stroke guidelines in the UK, USA and Australia. It is very widely read, with an attention score within the top 5% of all research outputs \(Altmetric, 11.12.20\). This review has provided evidence for the most promising treatment approaches to use with stroke survivors with visual field loss – specifically scanning training approaches.

[https://doi.org/10.1310/tsr18s01\-643](https://doi.org/10.1310/tsr18s01-643). This robust survey study, which achieved a 90% response rate through the use of evidence\-based survey design principles, was the first to address service provision for those with visual problems after stroke across Scottish inpatient clinical settings. It provided the first evidence of assessment methods, their frequency of use and the management approaches across the spectrum of different post\-stroke visual impairments. By focussing on Occupational Therapists based in all the acute stroke wards, it provided a ground\-breaking and comprehensive picture of clinical practice. The survey identified important variations and gaps in care provision after stroke \(especially in relation to eye movement disorders\). Importantly, it also enabled us to identify the main barriers to improving care, which included the lack of clinical guidance and poor access to specialist training.

This comprehensive and methodologically robust systematic review made an original contribution to the field of physical activity after stroke, as it was the first to synthesise quantitative and qualitative evidence on psychosocial, physical and environmental barriers and facilitators to post\-stroke physical activity. Its contribution was significant as this area was poorly understood and this evidence gap limited the ability of healthcare and exercise professionals to take into consideration a wide range of factors, including stroke survivors’ perceptions, when designing person\-centred physical activity interventions. Findings from this review made an important contribution to our insight into a wide range of stroke\-specific factors that need to be addressed to better engage stroke survivors in physical activity.

This observational study made an original contribution to our understanding of enduring sedentary behaviour patterns after stroke, as it was the first to follow a cohort of stroke survivors for 12 months– the longest follow\-up period investigated at the time. Utilising state\-of\-the\-art objective activity monitoring devices, this rigorously conducted repeated measures study provided an essential point of reference in the field, by demonstrating not only the amount, fragmentation and diurnal time curve of sedentary behaviour, but also its lack of change over time in the largest cohort of stroke survivors investigated at the time. These findings generated the insight that novel lifestyle interventions after stroke were needed that specifically targeted sedentary behaviour patterns after stroke.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research has been instrumental in the development of novel educational resources for the benefit of healthcare professionals \(including nurses, therapists, psychologists, GPs, paramedics, optometrists\), social care workers and specialist exercise professionals, and people affected by stroke within the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US, India, Brazil, and the Philippines. These resources have raised educational standards and enabled the development of innovative, evidence\-based stroke rehabilitation and recovery support services. The need for high\-quality stroke workforce education is highlighted in the Scottish Government’s Stroke Improvement Plan, the European Stroke Organisation’s Action Plan for Stroke in Europe 2018\-2030 and the World Stroke Organisation, as specialist education is essential for delivering stroke\-specific care to improve outcomes. 

 **Impact 1: Resource and service development for professionals: evidence\-based practice** 

 <ins>Vision rehabilitation</ins> <ins>after stroke</ins> 

 Based on the systematic review by Pollock et al. \(2011\) \[R1\], Hazelton was invited to contribute to the Stroke Training and Awareness Resources ‘Vision’ module, an innovative online professional education resource hosted by Chest Heart Stroke Scotland and commissioned by the Scottish Government as part of their Stroke Education Pathway. Over the impact period, an average of 395 module completion certificates per year were issued to health and social care professionals across the UK, North America, Australia, and the Middle East \[C1\]. 

 Evidence from the Cochrane review \[R1\] and UK\-wide practice survey \[R2\] also inspired a new GCU\-led collaboration between Hazelton, GCU Vision Science faculty \(Seidel\) and low vision service providers \(Visibility UK\), which initiated the UK’s first specialist Optometry Neuro\-Vision Rehabilitation clinic at GCU in 2017. Providing specialist assessment, diagnosis and rehabilitation post\-stroke, it has seen approximately 50 people from across Scotland \[C2\]. Hazelton’s survey \[R2\] was also instrumental in initiating and informing the first Best Practice Statement for stroke\-related visual impairment in Scotland \(2013\) \[C3\]. Alongside evidence\-based recommendations \[R1\], this Statement underpinned a new Stroke and Vision Pathway in NHS Lanarkshire in 2015 \[C3\]. This subsequently led to post\-stroke visual impairment being recognised as a clinical priority in the Scottish Government’s Stroke Improvement Plan \(2019\), which requires specialist services to be available to all people with post\-stroke visual impairment across NHS Scotland and audits their delivery \[C3\]. 

 <ins>Physical activity</ins> <ins>after stroke</ins> 

 Research by Tieges, Chastin, van Wijck on post\-stroke physical activity and sedentary behaviour \[R5\-6\] has been embedded in the Exercise after Stroke Specialist Instructor Course, the first Higher Education Institution\-validated course of its kind in the UK, led by van Wijck and delivered by Later Life Training \(LLT\). LLT provides evidence\-based specialist training for health and exercise professionals. A total of 401 LLT professionals have been qualified since the inclusion of R5 in course updates \(of which 383 since the inclusion of R6\), to deliver novel, evidence\-based exercise after stroke services across UK communities \[C4\]. LLT\-qualified professionals were selected by the Stroke Association to deliver their new Moving Forward after Stroke service in 2017, which was rolled out to 9 sites across the UK, reaching over 800 stroke survivors \[C6\]. This service resulted in perceived benefits in physical recovery, mental health and confidence \[C5\-6\]. Attendees reported engaging in moderate exercise on 5 days on average, compared to 3 days per week before the programme, and many joined a gym following the programme \[C5\-6\]. 

 **Impact 2: Resource development for people affected by stroke: evidence\-based self\-management** 

 <ins>Secondary stroke prevention</ins> 

 Based on her programme of research on family\-centred secondary stroke prevention \[R3\-R4, G2\], Lawrence was invited in 2014 as a topic expert on the Steering group of SelfHelp4Stroke, the first free, online self\-management resource hosted by Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland to support people affected by stroke. This innovative resource, developed in collaboration with the Interactive Content Team at the University of Edinburgh, was highly commended in the British Medical Association Patient Information Awards 2016. Lawrence led the multi\-professional team that developed the content for the stroke secondary prevention module ‘Keeping Well’, and contributed subject expertise to the ‘Getting Started’ module \[C1\]. Based on her research on barriers and motivators to post\-stroke physical activity \[R5\] and sedentary behaviour \[R6\], van Wijck was also invited in 2014 to contribute to SelfHelp4Stroke. This research was instrumental in designing the ‘Being Active’ module, which encouraged stroke survivors to be less sedentary, and to address their barriers to progress to a more active lifestyle \[C1\]. From launch in 2015 to May 2020, more than 21,000 people affected by stroke from 134 countries \(including the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US, India, Brazil, the Philippines\) have used SelfHelp4Stroke to support them in their self\-management \[C1\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 ‘Beyond the Archive’ originated with an AHRC\-funded project to produce the first catalogue of the vast, neglected archive of wood engravings made by the celebrated Victorian ‘woodpecking’ firm Dalziel Brothers, held by the British Museum since 1913. Amongst the many thousands of illustrations they created throughout the 19th century, the Dalziels illustrated Tennyson and engraved all the images for Lewis Carroll’s *Alice* books between 1865 and 1871. Using digitisation and open access, the project opened up this archive and extended the reach of Victorian image culture to impact communities beyond the academy. It has generated new understandings among curators, artists, teachers and students of the dynamic interactions between Victorian literature, art, and technological change. It has realigned creative and critical practices to encourage new forms of pedagogy and prompted artists and curators to enter into an explicit and generative dialogue with the archive in their work.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Field, Smith and Stevens represent a renowned centre of research excellence in Victorian literary and visual culture in English at Sussex, an institution which has long fostered interdisciplinary research on image\-text relationships. In 2008, Smith founded Sussex’s Centre for Visual Fields \(now the Centre for Photography and Visual Culture\) with the aim of facilitating innovative work with external partners on visual technologies. In 2015, Stevens’ expertise in 19th\-century wood engraving and long\-term collaboration with the British Museum \(BM\) generated a project to explore 49 fragile and uncatalogued albums of Dalziel material that had been largely unused since their acquisition in 1913. Between 1839 and 1893, the Dalziels were the preeminent practitioners of the recently invented technique of wood engraving, which enabled the industrial production of extraordinarily detailed illustrations, bringing fine art to the Victorian masses. 

 Stevens’ AHRC\-funded Dalziel Project **\[G1\]**, for which Smith was mentor, involved substantial primary\-source research on the Dalziels’ archive of 54,000 proofs, resulting in the creation of an open access dataset hosted at the BM **\[R1\]**. Innovative catalogue entries that make connections between material and artists across and beyond this complex body of work are accompanied by project photography \(nearly 14,000 photographs\) and summarise the historical and material knowledge discovered in Stevens’ primary research. This involved close attention to wood engraving technique – largely lost when it was rendered obsolete by photomechanical processes – and its distinctive aesthetic. It also foregrounded the company’s radically collaborative methods of commissioning and engraving works of art. Diverse research outputs bring to light many previously unknown illustrations, with often anonymous designers foregrounded and identified for the first time \(including women such as Margaret Dalziel, or Ann and Mary Byfield, working in an industry dominated by men\) **\[R4\]**. Stevens has delineated the tension between individual artistic expression, and mechanical production methods in which all artwork was necessarily signed ‘Dalziel’, developing methods for recovering and re\-contextualising images and artists otherwise lost in the archive. The project has also resulted in creative\-critical work exploring these themes **\[R5\]**, and writing for public audiences. 

 Once catalogued, photographed, and thereby opened up to scholarly and public enquiry for the first time, the project was able to move beyond this archive to fully mobilise its possibilities in the present. Stevens’ expertise on the Dalziel collection and wood engraving was augmented by Smith, whose pioneering and distinguished interdisciplinary research **\[R2\]** has ‘significantly deepened our understanding of Carroll’ \(Richards, 2017\). Field’s appointment in 2015 further extended the project’s scope, bringing outstanding research in the intersections of image and text in Victorian culture **\[R3\]**: her work on 19th\-century illustration and children’s literature, particularly her monograph on novelty picture books for children \(2019\), also connects to Dalziel via Carroll **\[R6\]**. Through shared interdisciplinary archival expertise in interconnected but distinct Victorian print cultural practices – moveable \(three\-dimensional\) books, photography, and wood engraving – Field, Smith and Stevens have been able to use and extend the Dalziel archive to generate new and innovative approaches to Victorian visual culture. 

 This multi\-faceted collaboration has produced new understandings of the reception and continued vitality of the *Alice* books and their illustrations. One example is the creation and curating of a publicly available online exhibition – ‘Alice to Alice: Dalziel 1865–1871’ \( [www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel/exhibition\-map](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel/exhibition-map)\) – which for the first time places Carroll’s work in the context of the huge range of engravings the Dalziels produced during their *Alice* period. This and other activities have engaged new constituencies with the Dalziel materials, contexts, and techniques, including the ‘Woodpeckings’ conference held at the BM in June 2017 \(which developed a dialogue with curators and curatorial practice\) and a series of impactful research\-led creative workshops on the BM’s collections and Victorian visual culture. Field, Smith and Stevens have further exposed the complex interplay of artistry, economics, and technology that determined image\-text relations in this period through their work with 19th\-century archives at the British Library, at the Sussex archival hub The Keep \(where they have digitised illustrations from the university’s ‘Baker Books’ collection\), and the Victoria & Albert Museum \(V&A\), where Field and Stevens were able to undertake research as Exchange Fellows in 2018\-19 and 2019\-21 respectively.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 With Stevens’ original research on the Dalziels and their huge array of wood engravings as its foundation, ‘Beyond the Archive’ has distinctly impacted on the practice of curators and artists, and brought new understandings of the Victorian period and its possibilities to students and their teachers. 

 **Curatorial Impact** 

 In cataloguing the large and complex Dalziel archive, Stevens collaborated with BM curator \[text removed for publication\] to design a new method that could capture a diverse array of material in a single record, describing multi\-media contents, multiple artists, and complex image\-text relations **\[R1, S1c\]**. Once integrated into the BM’s general online catalogue \(free\-to\-access with 1.3 million page views per month\), this became a major asset for the museum, transforming an obscure and uncatalogued archive into an open access resource with global reach. For \[text removed for publication\] at the BM, this is ‘the most enduring legacy’ of the first phase of the ‘Beyond the Archive’ project; the ‘cataloguing and imaging of the huge Dalziel archive of prints which has made this wonderfully rich and engaging body of work accessible to a global audience of millions who use the BM online database’ **\[S1a\]**. The catalogue’s specific innovations – developing ways of enabling users to navigate ‘very large collections’, consisting of work that is ‘difficult to curate and convey to contemporary audiences’ **\[S1b\]**; how to fully ‘reveal the value of such material’ through description and cross\-reference **\[S1c\]** – had further impact amongst the museum’s curators. When curator \[text removed for publication\] took on the task of cataloguing the BM’s Cruikshank collection in 2018, she was directed to the Dalziel archive, ‘as an exemplary project \[for\] cataloguing and communicating 19th\-century art’ **\[S1b\]**. For \[text removed for publication\], Stevens’ work provided ‘a model for cataloguing volumes with multiple illustrations’ **\[S1b\]**. Beyond the BM, \[text removed for publication\], curator at the V&A, has noted how the Dalziel catalogue ‘sets a new gold standard for museums and galleries’ in this field **\[S2a\]**. 

 \[text removed for publication\], curator at the V&A, was an attendee at the ‘Woodpeckings’ conference Field, Smith and Stevens hosted at the British Museum in 2017. The knowledge she gained there brought new materials and approaches to her work on specific V&A displays \(such as *Making an Impression*, shown at the V&A between 2019 and 2020\) and plans for the major exhibition *Alice: Curiouser and Curiouser*, originally scheduled to open in the Sainsbury Gallery at the V&A in June 2020 \(but postponed to March 2021\). For the exhibition, billed as ‘charting the evolution of *Alice in Wonderland* from manuscript to global phenomenon’ \( [www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/alice\-curiouser\-and\-curiouser](http://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/alice-curiouser-and-curiouser)\), \[text removed for publication\] drew on Stevens’ expertise and advice **\[S2b\]** and explains how the Dalziel research and catalogue ‘led directly to us requesting to borrow two \[Dalziel albums\] for the exhibition’; albums that she ‘had never come across’ **\[S2b\]** before. For both the exhibition and the display, she ‘relied’ on the ‘Woodpeckings website as well as the extensive cataloguing and excellent images of the Dalziel images in the British Museum online catalogue’ **\[S2b\]**. 

 The project team’s own *Alice*\-themed exhibition – ‘Alice to Alice’ \(2016\) – is a collaboratively curated virtual exhibition housed on the project website ‘Woodpeckings’ \( [www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/english/dalziel)\), innovatively designed to draw audiences into the multifarious world of Victorian wood engraving and engage them creatively in the research. The success of this led to a second virtual exhibition, ‘Beyond the Archive’ \(2020\), that displays the visual and textual responses of schoolchildren to the Dalziel material. \[text removed for publication\] \(BM\) has celebrated the project’s engagement as ‘brilliant and inventive’, encouraging ‘a very broad audience, from literary scholars, wood engravers to school kids, to make their own explorations of the diverse and sometimes wacky visual universe’ of the Dalziel Archive **\[S1a\]**. The website \(with 11,297 users between 2016 and 2020\) was launched at the Brighton Digital Festival in 2016 and the project was featured in *The Guardian* **\[S3\]**. For \[text removed for publication\], its innovation lies in its seamless linking of ‘theoretical and historical academic interpretation, cataloguing, widening participation and the contemporary creative practice of wood\-engravers all in one project. I’ve never seen anything done as holistically as that before’ **\[S1b\]**. 

 **Impact on Artists** 

 One of the key impacts of ‘Beyond the Archive’ has been its rich connections with contemporary artists and creative writers. Engaging them in the research\-based recovery of historical techniques has produced new work, and profoundly influenced the artistic practice of all those involved, as noted by engraver and author Simon Brett in *Multiples*, the journal of the Society of Wood Engravers **\[S5\]**. Artists were invited to research\-based workshops at the BM in April and July 2017; four – \[text removed for publication\] – went on to collaborate closely with Stevens, and together wrote a feature article in *Printmaking Today* \(March 2018\) detailing the artwork and practice that grew from the collaboration **\[S5\]**. As a result of her encounter with the Victorian archive, \[text removed for publication\] purchased new equipment to engage with Victorian techniques, the project triggering ‘a different phase of work for me’ **\[S4\]**. \[text removed for publication\] produced a new print responding directly to the Dalziels, *What Hope for Holding Back the Sea \(Ballot\)*, which won the Printmaker’s Prize in the New Light Art Prize exhibition, and has been widely exhibited **\[S5\]**. \[text removed for publication\] *Dalziels’ Apprentice* responded by manipulating techniques of 19th\-century wood engraving in work that was exhibited at Bankside \(2018\) and the London Original Print Fair at the Royal Academy \(2018\) **\[S6b\]**. For \[text removed for publication\] the engagement was revelatory: he explains that working ‘on the history of engraving techniques has changed the way I work, in that now I very often do two versions of each composition – a wood engraved version and a larger lino cut version which is a bit like a sculptor making a maquette for a larger work ... So, this work has given me new tools and insight’. Of the art he has produced as a direct result of working with the project, he explains, ‘I am reproducing a Victorian method … because the technique augments my own contemporary practice’ **\[S6a\].** 

 The same approach was adopted by the project team for their workshop with creative writers at the BM in December 2016 **\[S7\]**; this led to an interview with Stevens featuring in *The Library of Ice* \(pp. 117\-123\), a major work of creative non\-fiction by Nancy Campbell \(‘a dreamlike book *’ – The Guardian*; ‘a sparkling and wonderful meditation’ – *The Independent*\). There was strong, extensive feedback from all the practitioners, who said they had learnt ‘masses’ **\[S4, S7\]**. Beyond influencing work by renowned practitioners, the project’s research has raised the profile of Victorian printmakers in the local community: Stevens and Smith assisted in securing a blue plaque for the Dalziel brothers unveiled in Brighton in 2019 **\[S5\]**. The Word & Image Department at the V&A has also recognised the on\-going legacy of the BM events by proposing two similar study days in spring 2020 in order to use the Dalziel archive to creatively bring together UK and US printmakers \(delayed due to Covid\) **\[S2b\]**. 

 **Impact on Teaching and Learning** 

 Field, Smith and Stevens connected their extensive research on the Dalziel archive with their practitioner collaborations to engage with teachers and schoolchildren, organising a series of events between 2017 and 2020. Taking the digital archive and artwork into more than twenty\-five bespoke workshops, the team have enabled over 500 participants to produce research narratives and mixed\-media reinventions of Victorian word\-image texts **\[S8\]**. This work has included students at the National Art and Design Saturday Club; children at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff; and pupils at eight schools across the UK. These workshops subsequently informed teaching practice and improved learning outcomes, as \[text removed for publication\], teacher at \[text removed for publication\], confirmed: ‘The students were really engaged and learnt a lot about Victorian literature. \[The activities\] served as a great way to get them thinking about childhood in the past and how it has changed. The students learnt about print\-making and how images were created historically’. In terms of her own professional development, ‘It has shown me the importance of visual support to engage young students and the story\-telling using images activity would be great to replicate in the classroom’ **\[S9\]**. For \[text removed for publication\], teacher at \[text removed for publication\], ‘a great legacy of this project \[was\] helping the students engage and think about museums and their collections in a different way’ **\[S10\]**. 

 A further innovation was the project’s ‘Beyond the Archive’ virtual exhibition, showcasing creative work and critical engagement produced by the young people **\[S8\]**. Many examples, each testifying to the intensity and spark of the research\-based activities, are published on the Woodpeckings website, and were intended to form the basis of a physical exhibition at Brighton’s Jubilee Library which had to be moved online in 2020. The success of the online version led to the project being celebrated by the National Archives in their annual publication, ‘A Year in Archives 2020’. The virtual exhibition was accompanied by two online events with artists, curators, librarians and archivists from The Keep, The Jubilee Library, the BM, the V&A and The Society of Wood Engravers. For \[text removed for publication\], these events were ‘innately creative … the children gained a huge amount from responding to these pictures and the work that they have made in response to them has really blown us away. This sort of activity is enormously valuable for the children. It is looking at something old and making it new and relevant to them’ **\[S10\]**. Work produced in response to the workshop with the National Art and Design Saturday Club – a charity dedicated to raising attainment, broadening horizons and enhancing life skills among young people – was also exhibited in the National Saturday Club’s three\-day exhibition at Somerset House \(June 2017\) **\[S8, S9\]**. 

 As these examples demonstrate, the dynamic engagement of curators, artists, teachers and schoolchildren with the newly accessible Dalziel archive and the project’s research expertise has generated valuable new understandings of the period and enriched their creative and critical practices.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Barker’s** research into the historical representation of space and place co\-established Pelagios: a transdisciplinary initiative which weaves together stories held by objects and places, whether tangible \(a statue in a museum\) or virtual \(a cloud database\), by drawing digital connections between them. Pelagios’s method sets the baseline for a global community of practice which has revolutionised how professional services, GLAMs \(Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums\), and creative industries publish and conceive of their data. Pelagios’s co\-created tools are used all around the world in GLAMs and Digital Humanities \(DH\) teaching and infrastructure. Pelagios’s community of practice is so influential that it is now established as a registered charity \(the ‘Pelagios Network’\) with 30 partner organisations worldwide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Barker’s** AHRC\-funded **Hestia** project \(2009\-2010 GBP39,475, 2013\-2014 GBP63,896\) developed a pioneering methodology for studying the ways space is conceived and represented in a non\-modern text, using the *Histories* of Herodotus as a case study. This research, culminating in an Oxford University Press book, *New Worlds from Old Texts: Revisiting Ancient Space and Place,* argues for a paradigm shift in understanding how texts organise spatial information differently from maps. One chapter **\[O1\]** sets out a new method for conceiving of textual geography in terms of graphs of topological relations between places and the peoples who represent them. Another **\[O2\]** shows how this series of overlapping and increasingly complex relations challenges the notion of an abstract, mappable topography, leaving readers to grapple with the multidimensions of places and their ethical complexities. A third **\[O3\]** explores using digital tools for studying places in texts, to identify affordances and challenges of using contemporary technologies for representing non\-cartographic spatial thinking. 

 **Hestia** demonstrated the research possibilities of exploring places in a single text. With two digital humanities grants from Google \(2010\-2012 GBP27,150 & GBP38,786\), **Barker’s** **Google Ancient Places** project investigated how this work could be scaled up to enable the study of place information across any number of digital texts. It found that: \(i\) identifying places in large text corpora required disambiguation: for example, ‘Paris’ the place needed to be distinguished from ‘Paris’ the person, Classical ‘Athens’ from ‘Athens’ Georgia, and so on; and \(ii\) disambiguation was best achieved by using Uniform Resource Identifiers \(URIs\)—character strings provided by global authorities \(gazetteers\) that are stable and unique to each place, such as the URI for ‘Athens’,  [https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885), produced by the ancient world gazetteer, Pleiades. \(The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator \(URL\), or web address\). 

 Building on this research, **Barker’s** JISC\-funded **Pelagios** pilot \(2011\-12 GBP44,00, GBP154,000\) worked with internationally renowned curators of ancient world data online \(Pleiades, the German Archaeological Institute, the Perseus Classical Library\) to address problems facing Classical Studies as research pivots online—namely disciplinary division, the fragmentation of sources, and different data standards. With these partners **Pelagios** co\-created a lightweight but universally applicable method of linking online materials of different types \(texts, images, databases\), hosted by different global data providers. This method is based on the gazetteer URI: instead of compelling everyone to remodel their data according to some overarching ontology, the Pelagios method simply states that each provider should annotate the places mentioned in their data with the appropriate gazetteer URI record. By means of the *semantic annotation* of place references, Pelagios enables the resources hosted by different data providers to be interlinked, using the web technology of Linked Open Data \(LOD\) **\[O4\]**. 

 Winning three successive grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation \(from 2014 GBP382,434, GBP597,337 & GBP581,821\), **Pelagios** developed three pathways to impact. First, we worked with researchers from across the world to co\-create a new ‘web annotation’ format of LOD that facilitates the interlinking of historical resources from any discipline. The **Pelagios** format is now the de facto standard for Humanities LOD in disciplines as diverse as Australasian, African, Chinese, European, Latin American, and Middle Eastern studies, from antiquity to the present day. Second, with professional practitioners we co\-created **Recogito**, a free open\-source tool that enables the domain specialist or curator to annotate digital documents without coding expertise **\[O4\]**. Third, as its Community Director \(2016\-19\), **Barker** grew **Pelagios**’s influence across disciplines and beyond academia by giving conference presentations and workshops, providing consultancy, and managing a ‘small grants’ programme, which supported networking and resource development within the **Pelagios** LOD ecosystem. Formalising this community of practice, and after research into similar community\-based initiatives, **Barker** co\-established the **Pelagios Network** as a formal Association according to UK Charity law in July 2019. As its General Secretary, **Barker** oversees the coordination of work, pooling of resources, and development in cooperation with interdependent Partners, each of whom supply a Memorandum of Understanding \(MoU\) that sets out their shared objectives. Success is demonstrated by the fact that the **Pelagios Network** currently has 30 global Partners.

###  3. References to the research 

 Pelagios has developed a method of, built software tools for, and established a formal association around, producing LOD: books, chapters and articles are ill\-suited to publishing research of this nature \(software development\), which explains why there is only the one reference here to Pelagios **\[O4\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impacts on practitioners and delivery of professional services and practice** 

 As Community Director, **Barker** has worked with non\-academic public organisations focused on the ancient world to extend **Pelagios**’s method into the design and delivery of their services. At workshops, on Zoom, and by email he has consulted with over thirty data curators to co\-create best practice solutions that meet the needs of their various publics—specifically the challenge of making their data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The Director of ToposText, a free website and mobile app of geolocated classical texts, explains how engaging with the **Pelagios** community “ *changed \[his\] life*”, empowering him to overcome the challenge posed by an otherwise “ *impenetrable jargon designed by and for a narrow caste of DH \[Digital Humanities\] specialists*” **\[C1.1\]**. Adopting **Pelagios**’s method has helped him to “ *reorganize the ToposText website with stable URLs and more standard metadata*” and thereby incorporate his resource “ *in a complex international ecosystem of shared information*”. The Director of Data Science at the American Numismatics Society in turn describes how collaboration with **Pelagios** has enabled him to achieve his goal of “ *mak\[ing\] the cultural heritage materials of our once\-esoteric discipline more accessible to the public*” **\[C1.2\]**. He concludes: “ *Pelagios has been fundamental in the mainstreaming of our discipline*”. 

 **Impacts on understanding, learning and participation** 

 **Pelagios**’s success in co\-creating the open\-source tool **Recogito** is demonstrated by its subsequent impact on the design and delivery of curricula in Digital Classics, as well as Digital Humanities \(DH\) more broadly, across the world. **Recogito** forms an integral part of the DH syllabus at different UK institutions \(e.g. King’s College London **\[C1.10\]**, Exeter and Lancaster\), universities internationally \(in e.g. the US **\[C1.11\]**, Europe and Australia\), as well as the online Sunoikesis programme **\[C1.12**; for a full listing, see **C2.5\-C6\]**. A lecturer at Boğaziçi University \(Istanbul\) “ *found \[Recogito\] to be an excellent resource for introducing students to digital humanities tools*”, so much so that they “ *translated the Recogito tutorial into Turkish*” in order to “ *\[continue\] to use it \[in\] subsequent research projects*” **\[C1.3\]**. **Recogito** has over 7,000 users \(making collectively almost 5.6 million annotations\), each of whom, by virtue of using the tool, will have changed the way that they learn and engage with digital data **\[C2.3, C6\]**. A further sign of **Recogito**’s impact is the accolade of “ *best tool*” as voted by both the international Digital Humanities and Open Publishing global communities **\[C2.3\]**, whose number exceeds the tens of thousands. 

 As Community Director, **Barker** has extended the reach and significance of **Recogito** and the adoption of **Pelagios**’s method of linking data. As well as offering consultancy \(see above\), **Barker** initiated and managed a small grants programme, which supported the development of **Pelagios**\-based tools and/or the take\-up of **Pelagios** protocols. By funding this work, **Pelagios** has had a direct impact on 25 institutions in 14 countries, including Germany, the US, Israel, Australia, Croatia, and Argentina **\[C3\]**. Europeana, the European Commission’s Digital Service Infrastructure for Europe’s online cultural heritage, has validated the significance, reach and impact of **Pelagios** by dedicating a special issue of its research and development publication to reporting on the work of these small grants **\[C4, C2.4\]**. 

 A researcher at the Institute of Bibliographic Research and Textual Criticism in Argentina was one such holder of a small grant. In this context, where “ *digital infrastructures are sometimes obsolete*”, **Pelagios** has helped her and others like her ultimately overcome “ *barriers*” of “ *language and lack of institutional and financial support*” **\[C1.4\]**. Because of small grants, they “ *could start \[their\] own DH projects with no infrastructure*” and “ *develop projects that were important for \[their\] community in Argentina*”. In turn, **Recogito**, by being not only “ *very intuitive and ready\-to\-use*” but also multilingual, “ *is now a tool very much used in Argentina*”, and has “ *helped \[them\] to build \[their\] own community of Recogito users/users interested to collaborate in \[their\] projects*”. Above all, “ *Pelagios has been a global hub that facilitated projects in an open and collaborative community*”, because of which they “ *could work and interact with many groups from abroad*” with “ *which they had many interests in common but \[…\] had never realised*”. 

 **Impacts on creativity, culture and society** 

 **Barker’s** promotion of **Pelagios**’s tools and method has had significant impact on GLAM institutions, by helping them curate their collections more effectively and improve their reach. Following **Barker’s** keynote at a 2017 library conference in Greece, an audience member, a librarian at the Czech digital library Manuscriptorium, got in contact: they have since adopted **Recogito** as a tool for annotating their corpora, which, along with **Pelagios**’s LOD method more generally, has “ *simplified \[their\] process of creating mark\-up used for georeferencing*” **\[C1.5\]**. As another librarian at the British Library explains, workshops at the library’s 2019 *Season of Place* facilitated the adoption of **Recogito** as a “ *valuable toolkit*” for staff members to address the “ *technical challenge*” of “ *building bridges between text and geography*”. Recogito “ *annotations help the Library to improve the discoverability of \[their\] collections and to foster new research perspectives*” **\[C1.6\]**. This initial interest became formalised within the **Pelagios** small\-grant programme, as the British Library established a working group to scope out designs for “ *visualising data in time and space on web maps*” that would be of considerable benefit to curators and their publics. **Recogito** continues to be used as a “ *powerful yet easy to use*” tool without which “ *it would not have been possible to upskill \[their\] staff*” **\[C.1.6\]**. 

 A similar trajectory is evident in the experience of the Heritage Information Strategy Adviser at Historic England \(HE\). HE first participated in **Barker’s** AHRC\-funded GLAM network workshop in March 2020, which set out to explore how **Pelagios** LOD can help virtually reunite objects exhibited in different collections around the world. As a result of this event, **Barker** was invited to give a keynote presentation at the COST Action Saving European Archaeology from the Digital Dark Age Exploratory Workshop \(120 professional members representing 42 countries\). HE are now planning to use **Recogito** “ *to enhance the re\-usability of The Library of Unpublished Fieldwork Reports*” **\[C1.7\]**, which has over 30,000 monthly users \(researchers, students, cultural heritage curators\), and are becoming a formal partner of the **Pelagios Network** to “ *further solidify and advance the important ongoing work in this area*”. 

 **Impacts on the growth of heritage organisations** 

 In 2019, **Barker** formalised **Pelagios**’s principle of an open, collaborative and decentralised development of methods and tools by co\-founding the **Pelagios Network**. An official association of equal and interdependent partners under UK charity law, this free Network requires only one thing from a potential partner: an agreed workplan or ‘MoU’. By virtue of fulfilling this requirement, however, each and every partner of the **Pelagios Network** has agreed to change their working practice based on the **Pelagios** protocol and commit to at least two one\-hour meetings per month. All the practitioners mentioned in this case study have signed MoUs **\[C5\]**. Currently the **Pelagios Network** has 30 partner organisations worldwide, with on average 3 new partners joining every month. 

 By making access to its wide\-ranging skills\-base free of charge, as well as continuing to develop free opensource user\-friendly software, the **Pelagios Network** is reducing both financial barriers and technical constraints to using LOD. The impact on the cultural economy is particularly significant among smaller organisations, lacking the financial and/or technical support to do the work otherwise. According to HE’s Heritage Information Strategy Adviser, already “ *the Pelagios Network has been a very effective forum for enabling collective discussions about innovative LOD research and for exploring wider uses of open data and open software solutions, along with associated issues of sustainability*”, while **Recogito** is “ *unlocking much of \[the\] potential \[of archived material\], based on years of knowledge and testing*” **\[C1.7\]**. The Associate Producer at Ubisoft Massive, and participant in the Swedish\-based Cultural Heritage Incubator programme, notes that “ *Recogito offers a solid and proven base to build upon, while also keeping in mind the high standards required from academic researchers*” **\[C1.8\]**. “ *Partnering with Pelagios” has given her “an invaluable headstart \[…\], saved valuable months of prototyping time and \[…\] provided a clear visual benchmark for future tools*”. As a partner, “ *gaining access to the collective knowledge in the network gives \[her\] confidence in taking the right decisions and avoid reinventing the wheel for each new feature*”. 

 Lastly, the “ *Pelagios ethos*” of “ *loosely coupled, standards\-coordinated collaborative scholarship*” **\[C1.9\]** is providing the basis for a new kind of DH enterprise. Performant, a not\-for\-profit company, which co\-designs software tools with HEIs to support research and teaching, has “ *begun to craft \[their\] proposals and budgets both to take advantage of the technical leadership and data models which Pelagios has championed, and to provide for participation in the Pelagios Network as those projects mature*” **\[C1.9\]**. For them, Pelagios is much more than a DH initiative: “ *In an environment of limited funding for the digital humanities, and sometimes divergent and/or competitive, rather than cooperative and interoperable digital scholarship, the Pelagios Network has articulated, and is demonstrating, a model for collaborative digital scholarship*”. As such, “ *it’s a strategic advantage for \[them\] to follow Pelagios’ sterling example of collaboration and interoperability, and to participate in the growing and increasingly vibrant ecosystem, that the Pelagios Network is becoming*”.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

  

 Research by Professor Bale has shaped how political party membership in Britain is represented within news media and by parties themselves. The project has enabled a more accurate representation of the views of party members with regards to key social and political issues, and of the record and conduct of their leaderships accordingly. This has directly informed the discourse of the news media and political parties themselves in two key respects: \(a\) understanding of who joins \(and leaves\) political parties and why; and \(b\) considering what members’ views are on crucial political developments, including the Brexit process and its impact on members’ relationship with party leaderships. The project’s data and analyses have also served to shape politicians’ and parties’ own responses to key issues facing their membership subsequently, including reports of anti\-Semitism and Islamophobia, the contribution members make to campaigning, and attitudes on Brexit. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Bale’s ESRC\-funded research – the Party Members Project \(PMP\) \- has coincided with a dramatic period of upheaval in British politics. Jointly developed with Paul Webb \(Sussex\) and Monica Poletti \(Queen Mary\) and preceded by a pilot project with Conservative Party members in 2013, it initially sought to explain why party membership was declining, but the surge of several parties’ memberships presented a new puzzle to solve \[3.1, 3.2\]. The EU referendum outcome provoked new questions about members’ views on Brexit. Growing concern on key issues also led the PMP to explore the extent of Islamophobia and anti\-Semitism among members and to probe members’ preferences in a number of leadership contests that determined the economic, social and diplomatic policy direction of the parties involved \[3.2\]. The PMP initially ran from 2015\-18, before continuing with a second extension of ESRC funding into 2019\-2020 to cover the 2019 general election. 

 Prior to the PMP, no scholars had been able to undertake research on the members of several parties simultaneously. The PMP has therefore undertaken hitherto unparalleled, survey\-based research on the nature, attitudes, and behaviour of the members of six parties: The Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, UKIP \(and later the registered supporters of the Brexit Party\), the Greens, and the SNP \[3.3\]. The PMP is built on pioneering work from the 1990s, but also draws on comparative research insights \(from the *Members and Activists of Political Parties* project based at ULB in Belgium\).  It has pioneered the use of internet panels in order to survey party members simultaneously and – crucially – independently of the parties themselves. In addition, Bale and colleagues also conducted interviews with party managers and politicians in order to look at the demand as well as the supply\-side of membership \[3.3, 3.4\]. Key goals included understanding the characteristics of party members, why people join and leave parties, what members do during election campaigns, and members’ views and expectations of how parties are and should be run, including their views on leadership and candidate selection \[3.4, 3.5\]. The 2015 surveys were supplemented by voter surveys of partisans who were not party members, as well as surveys of members of unions affiliated to the Labour Party. 

 Evidence produced by the PMP has at times lent empirical support to otherwise ‘common sense’ perceptions about party members, but it has also generated findings that have run contrary to the expectations of professional journalists and policymakers. Some key results include: 

-  Members’ demographic characteristics sometimes differed from widely held expectations, with implications for inclusion, diversity and sustainability, as well as leadership contest outcomes. For example, Conservative Party members were found to be overwhelming male \(70/30\), while Labour Party members were much older and middle\-class than discussion of the “Corbyn youthquake” suggested. The surge of new Labour members may in part have been driven by the ‘educated left\-behind,’ but they were accompanied by a lot of re\-joiners who felt they had ‘got their party back’ \[3.2, 3.4, 3.5\]. 

-  Members’ views on Brexit differed sharply from both voters’ views and parties’ policies. Conservative members became increasingly keen on a hard or no\-deal Brexit \(which contributed to Johnson provoking and winning the 2019 leadership contest\), while Labour members were intensely pro\-Remain and Second Referendum \(which had a bearing on Keir Starmer winning the leadership in 2020\) \[3.3\]. 

-  Anti\-Semitism, and the dismissal of such, in the Labour Party was a serious problem, as was Islamophobia in the Conservative Party \[3.3, 3.7\]. 

-  Members’ \(offline\) activism is often related to feeling part of a local party’s social network and/or career ambition, although non\-member supporters do a lot of \(less intensive\) campaigning and could perhaps be persuaded to join if parties cleared up some misperceptions about the commitment involved \[3.7\]. 

-  The primarily ideological, but to some extent social, reasons people join parties nowadays differ little from those first revealed three decades ago \[3.1\]. 

-  Political parties lose as well as gain lots of members. This is mainly attributable to disagreement with the ideological direction their leaders are pursuing, meaning administrative approaches to retention have their limitations \[3.1, 3.3\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

#  Direct influence on journalistic reporting and public understanding of UK party membership 

 Bale’s research has directly affected how British political party membership is reported on, and understood, across national and international news media. This has in turn affected the reception of and engagement with British political party membership in the public sphere at large. PMP has provided an essential empirical basis for evidence\-based journalism in the UK and internationally across a range of issues affecting British political parties \[5.1\]. PMP’s findings have directly influenced how key journalists and commentators – and their readers \- understand the country’s party memberships in reporting on political developments \[5.1.2, 5.1.3\]. Analysis of PMP’s media reach shows that since the project’s inception at least 31 articles referencing PMP findings have been published in *The Guardian/Observer*, 17 in *The Independent*, 3 in the *Financial Times*, 7 in *The Telegraph*, 6 in *The Times* \(including Red Box\), 2 in the *Washington Post*, 4 in the *Daily Mail*, 5 in the *Daily Express*, 4 in the *Daily Mirror* and 6 in *The Sun*. In addition, BBC News and Sky News have posted at least 6 and 3 articles, respectively, using PMP findings. Many articles have also been published in alternative publications such as Huffington Post, *New Statesman*, LSE Blogs and partisan sites such as Labour List and ConservativeHome \[5.3\]. Bale and his colleagues have also been able to trail a significant amount of the project’s findings \[3.1\-3.7\] across a range of media outlets in advance of their \(conventionally slower\) academic publication, doing so 7 times in *The Guardian* \(print readership: 3,600,000; circulation: 111,953\), *The Independent*, *New Statesman* \(circulation: 37,828\), and the *Washington Post*, among others \[5.2\]. 

 PMP’s findings about the demographics \(relatively middle\-aged, well\-heeled, and well\-educated\) and attitudes \(even more socially\-liberal than left\-wing\) of Labour Party members – especially newer members who turned out, for instance, not to be so young – helped to explain and even predict Corbyn’s re\-election as party leader in 2016. As Tom Edgington, Senior Broadcast Journalist for BBC News attests, PMP ‘has proved to be a highly valuable resource for engaging storytelling. It’s offered audiences a unique insight into attitudes toward party membership – something that would have otherwise been very difficult to capture. This has been especially important in providing greater context and understanding to the leadership victor\[y\] of Jeremy Corbyn’ \[5.1.13\]. Similarly, the project’s findings about the demographics \(relatively old and well\-off, not so well educated\) and attitudes \(even more socially conservative than they were economically Thatcherite\) of Conservative Party members helped to explain and even predict Johnson’s election in 2019. As Heather Stewart, Political Editor of *The Guardian* has stated: ‘when the Project's research revealed that Conservative grassroots members rejected Theresa May's ""Chequers"" Brexit deal, preferring to run the gauntlet of no deal. It was that tide of opinion that eventually propelled Boris Johnson to the premiership’ \[5.1.4\]. 

 From the summer of 2017 onwards, the project showed that Labour Party members were overwhelmingly pro\-Remain and pro\-Referendum, and much more so than Labour voters and the Labour leadership, helping to explain and to intensify the latter’s dilemma over Brexit. The empirical basis of this finding had a significant influence on journalists’ reporting, as Anushka Asthana of ITV’s Peston has explained: ‘The stand\-out example of the Project making a difference would be the teams’ findings in the summer of 2017 pointing to just how pro\-EU Labour’s membership really was – something many guessed but until then had no hard data on’ \[5.1.5\]. In addition, the finding released in January 2019, that Conservative supporters had swung dramatically towards not just a hard Brexit but actually favoured a “no deal” was something of a game\-changer, as Sam Coates, Deputy Political Editor of Sky News explains: ‘the Project showing in January 2019 that most of Theresa May’s own rank and file preferred no deal to her deal had a big impact on Tory MPs’ \[5.1.6\]. 

 In January 2020, when many members were still reserving their judgement when asked unprompted, media \(not least SkyNews and *The Guardian*\) reported the projects’ discovery that Keir Starmer was the standout front\-runner in the Labour Party leadership contest. Until that point, much media reporting had assumed that a continuity Corbyn candidate would be performing more strongly. There was also a presumption that different leadership qualities were valued more highly by the supporters of particular candidates and that Momentum members were not as keen on the organisation’s preferred candidate as its executive.  PMP research on the Lib Dems also made it clear that Ed Davey was the clear front runner among members in the contest, which would take place later that year, even to the point of getting very close to the actual result \(see supporting statements from journalists \[5.1.6\-5.1.9\]; see also \[5.4\]\). 

 With respect to anti\-Semitism, the project showed that the problem within the Labour Party – at the grassroots level – was a real one, although one about which a substantial proportion of members were effectively in denial, choosing instead to see the issue as an attack on their leader. The project’s discovery of previous levels of Islamophobic prejudice among a substantial minority of Conservative Party members, at least in terms of their willingness to see more Muslim candidates selected, suggested that concerns voiced by, among others, Sayeeda Warsi, were borne out in reality \[3.1\]. The import of this finding is reflected in the testimony of several leading journalists, including Nick Cohen of *The Observer*, who writes, ‘I have found the Party Members Project to be an incredibly useful reference point.  In writing about racism, it has given me real data rather than anecdotal observations on the extent of Islamophobia on the right and anti\-Semitism on the left. At a time when party members have so much power over MPs and leaders, it provides an anchor in fact for anyone discussing Westminster politics’ \[5.1.11\]. 

 In February 2020, media reported the project’s finding that a very substantial minority of Labour members blamed not only Brexit for the party’s defeat, but a supposedly biased mainstream media. For Sienna Rodgers, the editor of LabourList, PMP has been ‘incredibly useful to us in helping to provide our already well\-informed readers with some research\-backed evidence on what the party at the grassroots is thinking, whether it be about particular issues, like Brexit, or about the leadership’ \[5.1.12\]. 

 Based on the evidence and its reach, the project’s extensive media engagement has thus shaped and advanced public understanding. Key outlets on which the research has been featured heavily reach millions of people, including ITV’s Peston, where Bale and his colleague were the first to be awarded “geek of the week” three times, which has a live\-TV audience of over half a million \[5.1.14\]. Journalists tweeting about PMP’s research have on average 181,000 followers, and social media analysis suggests that the project’s research findings appeared nearly 25 million times on users’ feeds as a result \[5.3\]. The project made two contributions to the BBC’s news website on the Tory members who would be electing the next leader, which received well over 1 million hits. As the senior BBC journalist Tom Edgington attests in respect of the first website contribution, there were ‘total page views: 1,141,413 and total engagement: 1:00.  Engagement is how long someone stays on the page before they click away. Typically, we’d be happy with anything over 30 seconds. So, to get a full 1:00 is incredibly strong and very rare. It shows that most readers were really engaged with your story and many got to the end of the article. In terms of youth reach, 33.2% of readers were between 18\-34 years old. Anything over is 30% good. And to get 33%, especially for a politics story, is excellent’ \[5.1.13\]. 

#  Improving understanding of party membership amongst Politicians, Political Parties and Parliament, and enhancing their engagement with members 

 Bale’s research has transformed how political parties understand the views of their membership, and how they engage with them accordingly. The project team was invited to give direct, face\-to\-face briefings and presentations at the party HQs of four of the six parties surveyed: Labour, the Conservatives, the Lib Dems and the Greens. The briefings/consultancy for political parties also allowed party managers to better understand their own members and improve the way they engaged with them \[see statements from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives \[5.4.1\-5.4.5\]. As Anita Boateng, former Special Advisor to the Chairman of the Conservative Party makes clear, ‘at a time when the party was looking closely at recruitment and retention of members, I was particularly interested in the work of the Party Members Project.  We invited one of the members of the team to come in and present to us in CCHQ on the demographics, attitudes and motivations of Conservative Party members. The presentation proved a really useful additional contribution to our understanding of our members and potential members and helped inform our strategy going forward’ \[5.4.1\]. 

 The PMP’s findings on anti\-Semitism in the Labour Party, initially submitted to \(but not – perhaps significantly – quoted in\) the Chakrabati Inquiry, informed a parliamentary inquiry. The Home Affairs Select Committee \(HASC\) Report on Antisemitism in the UK \(HC136, 16 October 2016\) cited the research, and it clearly informed the serious criticism of the party’s handling of the issue in addition to the recommendation that parties use the suggested reforms in their training and disciplining of activists and members \[5.5\]. The Committee on Standards in Public Life’s Report on Intimidation in Public Life \(Cm9543, December 2017\) also cited PMP’s research on social media use by party members, which informed the Committee’s recommendations that both platforms and parties seek to regulate and discourage such behaviour far more rigorously than they have in the past \[5.6\]. 

 Finally, the research findings also directly shaped the authoritative House of Commons Library Research Briefings on Membership of UK Political Parties \(SN05125\). Each of these periodic reports, which breakdown developments in and the demographics of party membership throughout the country, cited the research over five full pages with graphics \[5.7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Domestic abuse is a serious problem, for which existing legal remedies are often inadequate. Since 2000, Burton has undertaken in research and engagement with policy makers aimed at improving the law’s response to domestic abuse. In the current REF period, her research has directly influenced policy in two ways. Firstly, her research and evidence to a Scottish parliamentary committee in 2017 contributed to the case for introducing emergency protection orders \(EPOs\) in Scotland, and these were included in a Scottish Government Bill in October 2020. Secondly, she was the co\-author of an expert panel report for the Ministry of Justice in June 2020 which recommended fundamental changes to the process for child arrangement cases in England and Wales to reduce the risks of harm in cases where allegations of domestic abuse have been made. The Government accepted the report’s recommendations and gave effect to several key points through amendments to the Domestic Abuse Bill 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A major strand of Burton’s research has concerned emergency protection orders \(EPOs\), which were introduced in England and Wales in 2014. EPOs allow the police to exclude an alleged domestic abuser from a home shared with the victim, and to apply to a court for a civil order of the same effect but longer duration. Many European countries have similar orders and Burton researched the effectiveness of EPOs from a comparative perspective **\[R2\]**. Her research found that the effectiveness of EPOs depended on factors such as the training and resources given to the third\-party applicants \(typically the police\), and additional specialist support available to victims. Burton’s key recommendations on best practice for the implementation of EPOs to maximise the safety and autonomy of victims were that; \(i\) their consent should not always be required, \(ii\) the orders should be backed by criminal sanctions, \(iii\) that orders should be sufficiently long to be effective and \(iv\) to ensure that the third parties can comply with their requirements **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 Burton also has long\-standing research expertise in relation to specialist domestic violence courts \(SDVCs\) and integrated domestic abuse courts \(IDACs\). In the early 2000s, she was part of an interdisciplinary team that empirically evaluated the first SDVCs operating in the criminal justice setting in England and Wales \(Cook, Burton, Robinson, and Vallely, *Evaluation of Specialist* *Domestic Violence Courts/Fast Track Systems*, Crown Prosecution Service/ Department for Constitutional Affairs, 2004\). Separately, she engaged in comparative research concerning IDACs, which combine civil, family and criminal proceedings in domestic abuse cases, and which may adopt a ‘problem solving’ approach involving ongoing judicial monitoring of the perpetrator of abuse **\[R1\]**. This analysis led her to argue that there would be benefits to introducing IDACs in England and Wales, given that ‘silo’ working results in additional risk to victims, for example through conflicting court orders **\[R1\]**. In 2017, she was a key speaker at an international symposium held in London on domestic abuse and child arrangement cases, where she again argued for court specialisation in the family courts. She followed that with a journal article in which she argued for specialist domestic violence courts, to facilitate both independent advocacy support for victims and the greater use of special measures such as screening witnesses, each of which would tend to lead to a safer process and to safer outcomes **\[R4\]**. 

 Building on her research on court specialisation, from June 2019 to June 2020, Burton served as an academic member of an expert panel convened by the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) to examine the issues in child arrangement cases involving allegations of domestic abuse in greater depth. Burton contributed to a review of the law, the design of the call for evidence, the data collection and data analysis. The final report was co\-authored by the three academic members of the panel \[ **R5 –** summary in Section 4 below\]. 

 Among the academic members of the panel, Burton took responsibility for drafting Chapter 5 of the report, entitled ‘Raising and evidencing domestic abuse’. This chapter identified multiple barriers to raising domestic abuse, including limited understanding of coercive control among those involved, stereotypes among professionals concerning ‘real’ victims, mothers’ fears of false counter\-allegations, legal advice not being available, or poor advice being given not to raise domestic abuse. The chapter was the basis for the report’s recommendations for better training for all professionals, for more resources and for a process that is more trauma and safety aware. 

 Burton also took responsibility for drafting Chapter 8 of the report, entitled ‘Safety and experiences at court’. This chapter described how the court process is often re\-traumatising, with special measures \(such as screening, remote video link, separate entrances and waiting areas\) not being used effectively, victims being subjected to abusive cross\-examination with little or no judicial intervention, and the use of repeat applications for child arrangement orders as a means of continuing abuse. For this purpose, Burton took the lead in a review of the case law on section 91\(14\) of the Children Act 1989, which permits judges to prevent the making of repeat applications for child arrangement orders without the leave of a court. The review, published as an Annex to the report, showed that case law, by incorporating an ‘exceptionality’ requirement, has limited the effectiveness of this provision in protecting victims of domestic abuse \[ **R5**, pp. 206\-2111\]. The material in Chapter 8 resulted in recommendations on special measure, cross examination and amendments to section 91\(14\) \(discussed in Section 4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Burton’s research and expertise concerning the law’s response to domestic violence had an impact upon policy outcomes in the current REF period in two distinct ways. Firstly, her research and evidence on EPOs assisted the Scottish Government and Parliament in developing legislation to provide emergency protection orders which may be applied for by third parties, to enable victims to access remedies without personal, financial or other barriers. Secondly, her co\-authorship of a report on the law and process in child arrangement cases in England and Wales led to Government acceptance of the need for major changes in that area. Given the many thousands of child arrangement cases each year, and levels of harm encountered as a result of the process and outcomes where there are allegations of domestic abuse, this will significantly benefit many adult victims of domestic abuse and their children. 

 *Emergency protection orders \(Scotland\)* 

 Because of her expertise on EPOs in domestic abuse cases **\[R2, R3\]**, in October 2017, Burton appeared as an expert witness before the Scottish Parliament’s Justice Committee, as part of its inquiry on the effectiveness of such orders **\[E1\]**. Drawing on her research, Burton gave written and oral evidence on the scope and effectiveness of emergency protection orders in a range of European countries and supported their introduction in Scotland. That led the Scottish Government to a public consultation in December 2018 concerning protective orders to protect those at risk of domestic abuse, as part of which Burton’s evidence was referenced **\[E2\]**. 

 On 2 October 2020 the Scottish Government went on to propose the Domestic Abuse \(Protection\) \(Scotland\) Bill to provide for EPOs in Scottish law.  Burton’s evidence in 2017 was again referenced in the impact assessment relating to the Bill **\[E3\]**. On 22 December 2020, Burton then appeared for a second time as an expert witness before the Scottish Parliament Justice Committee, where she commented on the provisions for emergency protection orders in the Bill **\[E4\]**. This evidence addressed a range of matters, including the duration of the orders, whether the consent of the victim should be required, and their interaction with other orders. 

 *Redesigning child arrangement proceedings \(England and Wales\)* 

 Burton was centrally involved in the research and recommendations of the expert panel convened by the Ministry of Justice in 2019 to assess the risk of harm in child arrangement cases. It is estimated that between 49% and 62% of the 54,920 private law child arrangement cases in 2019 involved allegations of domestic abuse. The law and process on this subject have been a matter of public concern, including in child homicide cases where family courts had ordered contact \(an issue highlighted by the *Nineteen Child Homicides* report published by Women’s Aid England in 2016\). 

 The expert panel report, published on 25 June 2020, recommended major changes to child arrangement proceedings **\[R5\].** It found considerable failings with the existing adversarial system in child arrangement cases and argued that an inquisitorial ‘problem\-solving’ and trauma\-aware approach should be adopted. Its recommendations included more widespread use of special measures and restrictions on direct cross examination. It also recommended revisions to section 91\(14\) Children Act 1989, to reverse the judicially\-developed ‘exceptionality’ requirement concerning orders preventing repeat applications without leave, to increase the safeguards against the use of repeat applications to continue domestic abuse. 

 The authors’ work on the report was warmly welcomed by the policymakers concerned. In the Introduction to the report, the Ministry of Justice’s joint Directors of Family and Criminal Justice Policy thanked the three authors for *“their dedicated and tireless work leading the drafting of the report, ensuring that the voices of all those on the panel and who submitted evidence were heard*” \[ **R5**, p 14\]. The Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland, MP wrote to the panel members thanking them for their important contribution and singled out the authors for their work. In his words: “ *I am grateful to Professors Hunter, Trinder and Burton, for their tireless work in drafting the report. It was a herculean task to get the final report in a place ready to publish ahead of Report stage of the Domestic Abuse Bill, and I know the whole team appreciates how much time and effort they have each put into this*” **\[E5\]**. 

 The June 2020 report received significant attention outside of Government and parliamentary circles. The publication of the report attracted media coverage, with broad consensus about the significance of its findings and recommendations **\[E6, E7\]**. The Government response \(discussed below\) was welcomed by the Victims’ Commissioner \(Dame Vera Baird\) and Domestic Abuse Commissioner \(Nicole Jacobs\), among others **\[E6\]**. 

 More significantly, the report influenced policy developments concerning the legal framework relating to child arrangements cases. The Government published an implementation plan alongside the panel report on 25 June 2020 **\[E8\]**. The report was also the subject of a written House of Commons statement the same day by the Justice Minister, Alex Chalk MP . He described the report as “ *lay\[ing\] bare many hard truths about long\-standing failings in the family justice system” and promised that it would be “the springboard for the actions we will take to better protect and support children and domestic abuse victims*” **\[E9\]**. The statement went on to accept key general recommendations made in the report by promising to include an investigative approach as part of its pilot of an Integrated Domestic Abuse Court \(IDAC\) and to review the contact presumption in the Children Act 1989. 

 The ministerial statement of 25 June 2020 also accepted the Chapter 8 recommendations: \(1\) to extend automatic eligibility for special measures to victims of domestic abuse; \(2\) to ban cross\-examination by perpetrators of domestic abuse; and \(3\) to make it easier for judges to use section 91\(14\) powers to prevent repeat applications by ex\-partners **\[E9\]**. Legislative proposals on the first two points were then made through Government amendments to the Domestic Abuse Bill 2020, proposed in July 2020. On the third point, the Government continues to consider the best approach to revising section 91\(14\). 

 In a related development, in August 2020, Burton and Hunter were invited by the MoJ to be part of the Steering Group designing the new investigative system and piloting an Integrated Domestic Abuse Court \(IDAC\). Subsequently, in November 2020, Burton was assigned to the ‘One Family, One Judge’ working group set up by the MoJ to map the process and shape the design of the pilot IDAC.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The gin industry is booming, with Scotland leading the way in terms of innovative products. In 2019, UK exports of gin accounted for GBP672,000,000 taking total gin sales \(UK and overseas\) to over GBP3,200,000,000. Underpinning over a third of the 90 Scottish gin distilleries, is fundamental research on botanicals and distillation processes carried out at Heriot\-Watt University’s world\-renowned International Centre for Brewing and Distilling \(ICBD\). Identification of commercially available botanicals that provide desired attributes in terms of flavour, mouthfeel and terroir has enabled distillers such as Edinburgh Gin and Highland Boundary to reduce product development time, find new marketing and export avenues and improve processes. This has led to significant reduction in costs in terms of staff time, raw materials sourcing and in process design, all of which has also helped reduce incidence of costly retro\-fitting of equipment, product recall or reduction in sales potential. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

###   

 Fundamental research surrounding botanical behaviour during distillation, sensory impact and impact of scale\-up from lab/bench top to commercial gin production began in earnest in 2010. This foundational research was prompted by a desire to assist and meet an industry need with robust methods to convert small\-scale trials to full\-scale production and to determine optimal production parameters for extraction of volatiles during distillation. 

 Expanding on this base, and an understanding of the impact of botanical choice on the sensory characteristics of gin, a new phase of research into a Scottish Botanical Library began in 2014. This was enabled by the strategic appointment at HWU of Matthew Pauley in 2015 in addition to support by the Scottish Distillers Association with funding obtained via Interface \( [https://interface\-online.org.uk/](https://interface-online.org.uk/)\). This ongoing research involves single botanical distillation of plants to understand their behaviour during distillation, impact of distillation regimes, chemical and sensory footprint, and toxicity. This also includes research surrounding medicinal uses and a focus on plants native to Scotland to highlight the significance of raw materials available locally to Scottish distillers. 

 The funding from Interface facilitated close links with The Three Stills Distillery and enabled the publication of fundamental work on gin scale\-up, the comparison of production processes, and on key gin botanicals \(2017\-2020\). This work identified patterns in botanical extraction during vacuum distillation and in standard methods of vapour and steep infusion. The results have been used to develop a model that may be applied to predict extraction of specific flavour compounds from botanicals during gin production. 

 Further funding from The Gin Guild has also enabled fundamental research into the predominance of juniper in gin. Within current regulations, gin is defined as being “juniper predominant”. Our research in this area covers identification of marker compounds for juniper that may be used to define more specifically products that are perceived organoleptically as juniper predominant. This research will also enable authentication of gin products and has wider application within quality control of other distilled spirits.

###  4. Details of the impact 

<<<<<<< HEAD
 There are over 110 Scottish gins and over 90 distilleries currently producing gin within Scotland. The rise of gin has been rapid, with UK sales in 2010 around half those of Scotch Whisky. By 2018 both were worth about GBP1,200,000,000. In 2019, UK exports of gin accounted for GBP672,000,000 taking total gin sales \(UK and overseas\) to over GBP3,200,000,000. 

 Within Heriot\-Watt’s International Centre for Brewing and Distilling \(ICBD\), distilling research has been ongoing for over 30 years, with gin\-specific projects increasing in number and scale. Since 2010 we have worked with over 20 Scottish distilleries on specific gin/botanical spirit product development. This includes Edinburgh Gin \(formerly Spencerfield Spirits\), The Three Stills Distillery, Isle of Harris Distillery, Lindores Abbey Distillery, Raasay Distillery, Pickering’s Gin and Highland Boundary. Projects have also been completed with distilleries further afield including Durham Gin \(England\), Shortcross Gin \(Northern Ireland\) and Transylvanian Gin \(Romania\). The combined sales of the top seven companies we have worked with was over GBP120,000,000 in 2018\-19. 

 ICBD research led to the creation of the Scottish Botanical Library \(2014\), a library of over 70 botanicals developed with funding through Interface and partner distilleries \[5.1\]. The use of local or novel botanicals has become a popular method to create gins with a unique selling point and several members of the Scottish Distillers Association, \(SDA \- previously called the Scottish Craft Distillers Association\), have worked with the ICBD on new product development, experimenting with botanicals that may be sourced close to their distilling operations. 

 The recipe development process can be very complex, particularly when working with novel or large numbers of botanicals. To simplify the process, it is useful to distil individual botanicals to determine their flavour and aroma attributes to predict their contribution in the final recipe. The Scottish Botanicals Library was created to address this challenge and reduce the time and cost of recipe development and widening the possible options for botanical choice \[5.2\]. The library consists of plants that may be grown in Scotland and can be sourced in dried form in amounts suitable for large\-scale commercial production of either gin or botanical spirits. Each botanical has been distilled individually, providing a collection of distillates for sensory analysis. The library has already been a valuable resource for projects with both new start companies and developing businesses, vastly reducing the time and cost of recipe development and widening the possible options for botanical choice and helping create new products. 

 A collaboration, supported by a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) in 2014, with Edinburgh Gin, initially enabled the company to produce the original premium Edinburgh Gin product in house in an artisanal distillery whilst transferring Heriot\-Watt’s knowledge of gin\-making to the company. In addition, it facilitated the creation of new products and techniques, exploring new botanical ingredients and distillation methods. The KTP led to investment in a third still to meet increasing demand and an increase in annual sales turnover of \[text removed for publication\] \[5.3\], Edinburgh Gin’s Head Distiller, said; 

 *“Seaside Gin was the first of our collaborations in partnership with Heriot\-Watt University’s International Centre for Brewing and Distilling. Such has been the success and popularity of Seaside Gin, we have had to transfer production from the small 150 litre still to our larger 1000 litre still at our second site. We will now be producing 1300 bottles per distillation, with at least 4* *distillations per month. Testament to the success of developing and using a fantastic botanicals library resource for the benefit of the industry in Scotland.”* \[5.4\] 

 ICBD also collaborated with Highland Boundary, a craft distillery who identified a gap in the market for Scandinavian\-inspired spirits with the botanicals sourced from local woodlands. By combining botanicals from the Highlands with grain spirit from the South of Scotland the company crafted a new generation of Scottish spirits firmly rooted in the Scottish Landscape. The Director of Highland Boundary, said: 

 *""By accessing the expertise at Heriot\-Watt University we were able to try out different botanicals to produce new flavours of spirit with distinct Scottish flavours reflecting Perthshire’s ‘big tree country’. Now that we have launched our first product, Birch and Elderflower Wild Scottish Spirit, we want to build the company and create employment in an area where manufacturing jobs are few and far between.""* \[5.5, 5.6\] 

 Following on from the initial development of the Scottish Botanical Library ICBD researchers looked more closely at each botanical, firstly determining whether each is listed within the USA GRAS \(Generally Recognised as Safe\) list and also to identify any potentially toxic compounds that could be extracted by distillation with ethanol. The latter is necessary to ensure consumer safety and the former has been used to advise companies on botanical choice for products intended for export. The collaborative work with the Scottish botanical library led to the award for “Multiparty Collaboration” at the Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards \(SKEA\) 2019 \[5.7\]. Dr Annie Hill was also runner up in the 2018 SKEA for ‘Outstanding Contribution to Knowledge Exchange’ based on gin research. 

 Expertise from ICBD led to Dr Annie Hill co\-founding the Scottish Distillers Association in 2014 in collaboration with industry \(Strathearn Distillery\) and Interface Food & Drink. The association currently has over 30 distillery members and serves to assist in business development and networking. The association has been involved in co\-funding research within Heriot\-Watt for the benefit of its members. Benefits include reduced R&D time through use of the botanicals library and access to expertise within Heriot\-Watt. In addition, Dr Hill is a member of the Scottish Cross\-Party Group on Scotch Whisky which covers all distilling activities within Scotland. Representation on behalf of the gin industry is made within this group and subsequent government publications including the  [Brewing and Distilling Scottish Government Report 2018.](https://digitalpublications.parliament.scot/ResearchBriefings/Report/2018/10/11/Brewing-and-distilling-in-Scotland---economic-facts-and-figures)

 Moving from caramel to instabilities in GF bread 

 
 **Figure 1:** The Genius Food brand and their fresh, sliced, gluten\-free loaf. 

Gluten intolerance is widespread, with coeliac disease affecting 1% of the European population \[ **I1**\]. Historically, gluten\-free \(GF\) bread was hard, dense and dry, and eaten only out of necessity. Lucinda Bruce\-Gardyne, FRSE, founded *Genius* in 2008 after creating the first fresh white and brown GF sliced loaves equalling mainstream wheat bread in quality and cost \(Figure 1\). The company now sells over 25 products worldwide, developed and manufactured mostly in Bathgate, Scotland, with an annual turnover of GBP34,000,000 \[ **I2**\]. 

 *Genius* learned about the above\-mentioned UoE expertise when their Research Manager met UoE’s Dr Keith Bromley at a food\-science conference. Subsequent discussions with the company suggested to both parties that the approach used in \[ **R3**\] to study complex foods could be adapted to solve a long\-standing problem: the instability of GF dough. Excluding gluten from dough dramatically increases its sensitivity to small variations in recipe or processing conditions: a 5g difference to one ingredient in a 2kg GF bread mix makes the difference between a high\-quality loaf and a holey, crumbling one \(Figure 2\). Such sensitivity drives up costs for the company and lowers product consistency for the consumer. 

 The overwhelming majority of the literature on wheat dough emphasizes gluten’s elastic properties, and the GF literature typically discusses how to replace the elasticity lost due to the absence of gluten. Drawing on previous experience with polymer flow instabilities in confined spaces \[ **R1, R2**\], the UoE team rapidly homed in on a different issue. \[text removed for publication\]. 

 Guided by previous experience in developing a model caramel using the ‘subtractive formulation’ approach, the team developed a model GF dough, which allowed them to test rapidly the effect of various ingredients \[text removed for publication\].

 Mentorship for University of Edinburgh entrepreneurs 

 As a result of the UoE\- *Genius* collaboration, a productive working relationship was established between the University and the company’s founder, Lucinda Bruce\-Gardyne. This led to a successful application to the Royal Society to appoint her as the Entrepreneur in Residence within the School of Physics and Astronomy \(2018–20\). Bruce\-Gardyne’s work has created an outward\-facing, entrepreneurial culture amongst the School’s early\-career researchers \(ECRs\), and has expanded their ambition beyond academic work at a crucial stage of their career. Bruce\-Gardyne has organised 32 master classes \[ **I5**\] \(average attendance of 25, mostly ECRs\) in which a diverse range of speakers, many of whom are physicists\-turned\-entrepreneurs, have imparted their experience of moving from research to business. Bruce\-Gardyne has also provided mentoring to ECRs who have successfully started three companies \[ **I6**\]: Dyneval, a company using specialised microscopy to characterise particle dynamics, initially focussing on animal sperm motility for fertility applications \[ **I7**\]; QuestPair, which specialises in matching academic experts with companies \[ **I8**\]; and InVed, a company using patented technology to create environmentally\-friendly personal care products \[ **I9**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 As a global community of NGOs, policymakers, businesses and modern slavery survivors work to achieve the United Nations \(UN\) Sustainable Development Goal \(SDG 8.7\) of ending modern slavery by 2030, Trodd’s research puts modern slavery survivor voices at the heart of antislavery efforts. The result has been improvements in the quality of antislavery policies and practices. For example, Trodd’s research has shaped the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery at the inter\-governmental level; the strategies and programmes of multiple NGOs; and the national policies and frameworks of the UK Home Office and the Care Quality Commission. The three key impacts have been to i\) establish the policy value of survivor narratives with key stakeholders; ii\) influence policymaking and iii\) achieve changes in NGO practice including support for the development of the first survivor\-led NGO that empowers survivors to be antislavery leaders.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 As part of an AHRC\-funded project \( **6**\), Trodd’s research focused on the historical importance of survivor self\-representation and on applying an “antislavery usable past” that recognises the importance of slavery survivor voices to antislavery. Trodd analysed the self\-representation of Frederick Douglass, 19<sup>th</sup>\-century America’s most well\-known survivor of slavery, including Douglass’ extensive use of his life\-story and image to advocate for change \( **1**\). She then researched the legacies of Douglass’ self\-representation \( **2**\) for 20<sup>th</sup>\- and 21<sup>st</sup>\-century social justice movements, and outlined the strategies available for policymakers across Europe as they tackle the problem of modern slavery, including the use of slavery survivors’ testimony to better understand slavery’s root causes \( **3**\). 

 Trodd’s research \( **3**\) included material on the definition of modern slavery, for which she drew on the early stages of her research into contemporary survivor narratives to make the case for a definition based on the core characteristics of enslaved peoples’ experiences. As part of this research, Trodd created *Voices: Narratives by Survivors of Modern Slavery* \( [www.antislavery.ac.uk/narratives](http://www.antislavery.ac.uk/narratives)\), the world's largest archive of modern slavery survivor narratives. Between 2014 \- 2019, she applied the lessons of 19<sup>th</sup>\-century survivors’ self\-representation \( **1**, **2**\) to work with NGO partners and a grant\-funded team \( **6**\) of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to gather over 1000 narratives—over a million words—by survivors of modern slavery for *Voices*. She soft\-launched the database with 50 narratives in 2016, grew it to 1000 narratives over a three\-year period, then launched it publicly in early 2019. It had over 1200 narratives by 2020 and continues to grow. The database provides access to survivors’ ideas and voices, on a large scale, for the first time. Since its launch it has offered policymakers and NGOs the opportunity to systematically design new strategies based on modern slavery survivors’ experiences and ideas. It provides insights from survivors’ own voices into modern slavery hotspots, trafficking routes, and the nature of the challenges that survivors face in liberation. 

 There remains no legal definition of “modern slavery” and so, supported by ESRC funding \( **7**\), Trodd analysed the survivor narratives in order to provide a definition of modern slavery that could be used in practice by policymakers and frontline workers \( **4**\). Her analysis of the narratives revealed survivors’ definitions of modern slavery, and showed what these definitions reveal about the limitations of government and NGO approaches to tackling modern slavery. It examined key debates on the legal definition of modern slavery from the perspective of survivors, and argued that survivor narratives point to five new criteria that help to define modern slavery, all based on elements of human experience lost or denied to those who are enslaved. It showed that what ties these definitional layers together is their shared starting\-point: slavery’s impact on the individual rather than the slaveholder’s intent. Her research concluded that a survivor\-informed definition expands our understanding of slavery’s nature and can shape antislavery policies and practice. 

 Trodd also researched the role of survivors in antislavery movement\-building across two centuries, comparing 19<sup>th</sup>\- and 21<sup>st</sup>\-century survivor organising techniques, and used the modern slavery survivor narratives database to offer recommendations for how to better recognise contemporary survivor voices as part of a long tradition that includes historical survivor\-leaders like Douglass and Harriet Tubman \( **5**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 2016/17 Trodd was instrumental in developing the University of Nottingham’s Rights Lab Beacon of Research Excellence, one of 6 transdisciplinary Beacons each addressing a global challenge, directed at the UN SDGs. Trodd has been the Director of the Rights Lab since its inception and has led the development of the research and impact agenda for the Rights Lab and its research teams \(members of whom are survivors of modern slavery\). The Rights Lab delivers research to help end modern slavery \(SDG 8.7\), which traps an estimated 40,000,000 people globally. It is the world’s largest and leading group of modern slavery researchers. Trodd’s leadership has been instrumental in establishing mechanisms to ensure recognition of the policy value of survivor narratives, shape policymaking and give survivors agency in influencing NGO practice. She used her research into survivor self\-representation to position modern slavery survivors’ voices at the centre of today’s antislavery efforts. 

 **Establishing the Policy Value of Survivor Narratives with Key Stakeholders** 

 Trodd supervised research fellows from the Rights Lab to produce two key policy documents: 

 1\) *Voices: Ideas for Using Survivor Testimony in Antislavery Work* \(2019, Murray *et. al*\), uses Trodd’s research into survivor narratives \( **3**, **4**\) and the *Voices* database \( **4, 6**\) to explain the many potential uses of survivor testimony for policymakers and NGOs, including for understanding patterns of exploitation; recognising drivers for modern slavery across sectors and regions; designing interventions that focus on prevention and survivor\-informed programme evaluations; refocusing aftercare around survivor needs; and understanding the impact of disruptions \(for example, environmental disasters\) on modern slavery risk. The *Voices* report is included in the resource section of the **UK Independent Anti\-Slavery Commissioner \(IASC\)** website. 

 2\) *Survivor Involvement in Anti\-Slavery Policy Making: Guidance for Policy Makers* \(2020, Brotherton *et. al*\) uses the lessons of the narratives database \( **4, 6**\) about the value of survivors’ insights, and Trodd’s research about models of survivor leadership \( **5**\), to provide guidance for policymakers on how best to involve survivors in the work of designing policy and front\-line services. The **Independent Commission for Aid Impact \(ICAI\)** cited a paragraph from the *Survivor Involvement* report in a 2020 evaluation of the UK Government’s response to modern slavery that called for more survivor involvement in antislavery work \[ **E**\], while the **Home Office** called the report “ *really useful*” and said it would “ *take note*” of its guidance “ *going forward*” \[ **C**\]. 

 **Influencing Policymaking** 

 At a national level Trodd responded to a request in 2018 to brief the **Cabinet Office** and the Chairman of the **Joint Intelligence Committee** on her findings about the drivers of modern slavery that emerged from the *Voices* database. The briefing session discussed the narratives, including their value for revealing human trafficking routes \[ **B**\]. As a result of the briefing, the Joint Intelligence Organisation requested information from Trodd on whether the narratives could show “ *the movements of trafficked individuals … how people become enslaved in the first place*” \[ **B**\]. 

 In 2019, Trodd used her research findings to help shape the **Home Office’s** Modern Slavery Act \(MSA\) Section 49 Statutory Guidance on identifying and assisting victims. Working with the Rights Lab Impact and Policy Engagement lead \(Brotherton\), Trodd shared with the Home Office \(and 20 other key policy stakeholders who work on the question of slavery survivor recovery and support\) her article \( **4**\) about survivor definitions of modern slavery, and a two\-page policy briefing on the article’s findings. The policy briefing included four key recommendations for policymakers, including to ensure that survivor voices are central to the development of survivor support services. The Home Office confirmed that it found the research “ *on definitions extremely helpful*” and invited feedback on its draft Statutory Guidance from Trodd and the Rights Lab team \[ **C**\]. Trodd used her research findings \( **4**\) to inform her response, and the Home Office then used this feedback to edit the final Guidance \(published in March 2020\), which explains: “S *urvivors’ voices must always be heard, and their rights respected*” \[ **C**\]. The Home Office called Trodd’s feedback on the Statutory Guidance “ *useful*” and “ *really helpful*,” and confirmed that it tried to “ *reflect*” it in the guidance \[ **C**\]. 

 In 2019, Trodd and Brotherton shared Trodd’s research \( **4**\) and its accompanying two\-page policy briefing with the **Care Quality Commission** **\(CQC\)**, which regulates all health and adult social care in England. The CQC was developing an inspection framework to assess the quality of support services and safehouses for survivors of modern slavery. One of the policy briefing’s recommendations, based on Trodd’s research \( **4**\), was to “ *ensure that inspection frameworks of survivor support services incorporate survivor voices and include an assessment of the extent to which the five elements lost or denied to those in slavery have been restored*” through recovery support. The CQC confirmed that it “ *found the paper very useful and it was included in the guidance pack that has been given to our inspectors*” \[ **D**\], adding that the CQC also looked closely, “ *as part of our inspection process and assessment framework, at how survivors’ views are being sought by providers and how providers are working to understand the psychological impact on survivors of their circumstances*” in order to “ *ensure that the wellbeing of survivors is central to the safehouse provision*” \[ **D**\]. The CQC’s safehouse inspection framework includes recommendations for how inspectors should consult directly with survivors in 16 different parts of the overall guidance \[ **D**\]. The inspection regime went live in October 2020 \[ **D**\] and was incorporated into the Government’s new Modern Slavery Victim Care Contract, worth GBP281,000,000 over five years \(2020\-25\) \[ **D**\]. The Government believes this regime will “ *ensure the consistency and quality of support … and give victims the help and support they need to begin to rebuild their lives*” \[ **D**\]. 

 In 2020, Trodd’s research shaped another set of UK Government strategies. The **Independent Commission for Aid Impact \(ICAI\)** reviewed the UK's approach to tackling modern slavery through the aid programme and explained in a paper that a “ *unique and innovative feature*” of its review was its work to “ *mine a major survivor testimony database for relevant narratives … Voices … the world’s largest database of survivor testimonies*” \[ **E**\]. ICAI used Trodd’s database to “ *gain a broader understanding of the nature of the modern slavery challenges in our case study countries and beyond*” and “ *to provide context on the impact of modern slavery on victims and survivors*” \[ **E**\]. The final ICAI report gave as one of its five recommendations that UK Government departments “ *do more to draw on survivor voices, in ethical ways, with a particular focus on inputs to policy and programme design, and to deepening understanding of lifetime experiences*” \[ **E**\]. In its response to the ICAI report in November 2020, the Government accepted this key recommendation, acknowledged “ *the need to improve the integration of survivor voices into the design, implementation and review of the HMG modern slavery portfolio*” and committed to reviewing “ *lessons from the way in which we engage with survivors*” \[ **E**\]. 

 At the international level, in March 2019 Trodd led a Rights Lab team in the development of a written submission to the **UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery** delivered in September 2019 to the **UN Human Rights Council**. Adapting and citing the findings of Trodd’s research \( **4**, **5**\), the Rights Lab’s submission to the Rapporteur explained the importance of empowering survivors to develop strategic interventions that focus on addressing lived experiences, employing survivors’ ideas in antislavery programme design to achieve a survivor\-informed perspective on sustainable development, and developing survivor\-informed policy at the local, national and international levels. The Rapporteur’s final report used the evidence submission and cited Trodd’s 2018 article \( **4**\) and pointed to a “ *growing recognition that giving victims and survivors agency and voice through their active participation in programme and policy design and delivery strengthens those initiatives*”; argued that “ *survivors are uniquely placed to…identify what might prevent slavery*”. The Rapporteur praised a “ *growing effort…to empower survivors as…leaders of the anti\-slavery movement*” and recommended that future antislavery efforts “ *be more systematically survivor\-informed*” and “ *ensure that the full range of global, regional and national efforts benefit from the insights that survivors can bring to bear on programming and policy design and implementation*”. The Rapporteur quoted the Rights Lab’s evidence submission: “‘ *survivor\-informed policy and survivor\-led initiatives should be the norm and not the exception*’” \[ **A**\]. The Special Rapporteur’s concluding recommendations were that States ensure “ *antislavery efforts are survivor\-informed*,” including “ *policymaking, programme design and programme implementation*”; businesses work “ *closely with survivors…to ensure that future antislavery efforts learn from their experience*”; and international organisations promote “ *active victim/survivor participation in policymaking*” \[ **A**\]. Citing Trodd’s article \( **4**\) and evidence submission as its main sources of evidence for these recommendations \[ **A**\], the report delivered the strongest call to date, by any Special Rapporteur, for survivor\-informed antislavery efforts. 

 **Changing NGO Practice** 

 Working as both an individual scholar and as the director of the Rights Lab, Trodd has also supported a survivor leader, Minh Dang, to establish and grow **Survivor Alliance** \(SA\), the world’s first survivor\-led NGO that empowers survivors to be antislavery leaders. SA launched in April 2018 with Dang as its Executive Director. It was incubated in the Rights Lab for its first year, then by mid\-2019 became an independent not\-for\-profit that works in partnership with the Rights Lab. 

 SA organises and coordinates survivor leadership in the UK and globally \[ **F**\]. It is the first survivor\-led NGO to focus on developing survivors as leaders in the contemporary global antislavery movement, and “ *moves survivors from being occasional spokespeople to strategic thinkers and movement leaders*,” as Trodd explained in a media interview on the day of SA’s launch \[ **F**\]. SA had 130 survivor members globally by the end of its first year, 211 members by the end of its second year, and 290 by December 2020 \[ **F**\]. Its annual reports for 2018 and 2019 show a critical mass of interconnected survivor leaders who have improved access to employment and training in the antislavery field \[ **F**\]. Dang explained SA’s impact thus: “ *We have seen changes to the cultures and practices of the antislavery movement to incorporate survivor expertise through dozens of SA consultations and training sessions, including several on which Zoe and the Rights Lab have partnered to deliver*” \[ **G**\]. By early 2020, SA had already created 90 consulting opportunities for survivors and further enabled survivors by raising over USD9,300 \(to Oct 2020\) in income and scholarships for their use \[ **F**\]. 

 SA members described the impact of SA’s work for them: “ *Survivor Alliance has given survivors in the UK a platform to raise our voice and a space where we can unite and empower ourselves*”; "" *I was never taken seriously until Survivor Alliance stepped in*”; “ *Survivor Alliance…has made me feel like helping other people who are exploited more, it has made me understand other survivors and victims better*”; “ *Survivor Alliance have given me the platform to empower myself, and speak up loud enough for the authorities and media to hear me*”; "" *Survivor Alliance has opened my eyes to see that my life experience is my expertise… created a platform for me to share my expertise... and educated me in the process*""; “ *Survivor Alliance has given me tremendous support to build my confidence and amplify my voice in the field*”; “ *Survivor Alliance allowed me to connect with other survivors, to...give me the necessary support to take action in the anti\-human trafficking movement. It feels like another part of my healing journey*” \[ **F**\]. 

 Dang explained the importance of the collaboration with Trodd and the Rights Lab to SA’s success. The Rights Lab is SA’s “ *key partner*,” has been a “ *fantastic supporter of who we are and what we do*,” and was “ *important to different stages of Survivor Alliance’s launch, growth and development*” \[ **G**\]; while Trodd “ *has been an important partner*” to SA, supported its “ *launch in 2018 and its growth over the next 2.5 years, including by leading on the development of a Survivor\-Ally Manifesto with 14 Principles of Ally Behaviour and nine concrete commitments to action*” \[ **G**\]. Dang noted that this manifesto “ *formed part of a national training for survivor allies \(including from the Home Office and major NGOs\) in October 2019 for the UK's National Anti\-Slavery Day*” \[ **G**\] which generated pledges by 18 of the participating organisations \(including the **West Midlands Anti\-Slavery Network, Sainsbury's, the Home Office, Anti\-Slavery International and Hope for Justice**\). These set out concrete ways they would integrate survivor leadership into their work \[ **H**\]. Dang expanded on Trodd’s role: “ *I have greatly valued her research\-informed co\-development of Ally guidance, policy briefings and training materials, as well as her collaboration to turn her research findings \(about the importance of survivor voice and leadership\) into action in the form of her intellectual partnership and practical support for Survivor Alliance*” \[ **G**\]. Trodd’s work with SA, including on the manifesto \[ **H**\], was informed by her research into survivor leadership \( **5**\), which in turn drew from her analyses of survivor self\-representation \( **1**, **2**\) and narratives \( **3**, **4**\)—and Dang observed that Trodd’s research “ *helped to underpin Survivor Alliance’s mission with evidence*” \[ **G**\]. 

 The onward impact of Trodd’s work with SA extended through SA’s work with multiple leading NGOs. For example, SA changed the work of the leading international human rights NGO **Walk Free** in its high\-profile annual report about all government responses to modern slavery globally. In October 2018, Walk Free asked SA to review its conceptualisation of a strong government response to modern slavery \[ **I**\]. In a workshop setting hosted at the Rights Lab, a group of 10 UK\-based SA members provided detailed insight into Walk Free’s conceptual framework across 104 indicators and developed concrete policy recommendations for improving government response. In April 2019, SA delivered a similar three\-day workshop with Walk Free in India with 15 survivors of modern slavery that built “ *on the model developed in Nottingham*” and was “ *the first time survivors in India had gathered to share lived experiences and perspectives on government progress in responding to slavery*” \[ **I**\]. The workshop in India generated a further six recommendations for the government assessment \[ **I**\]. 

 As Walk Free explained, these two workshops with SA “ *provided us with valuable insight into what was actually important for those who have experienced various forms of slavery*,” and the workshop findings “ *were incorporated into our conceptual framework*,” therefore shaping how Walk Free completed its data\-gathering for the government response assessment \[ **I**\]. Walk Free also said of SA’s impact on its own practise that the SA workshops provided “ *invaluable feedback for … our advocacy work* … \[and\] *helped us to strengthen our understanding of the implications of government policy to combat modern slavery*,”\[ **F**\]. Walk Free also explained that the workshops enabled participating survivors themselves “ *to gather information that they could take back to their communities*” and to “ *use the report to hold their government to account … \[and\] push for legislative change*” \[ **I**\]. Walk Free’s final report was launched at the UN headquarters in July 2019 with an invitation to governments to respond by changing their policies and strategies. The **President of the UN General Assembly** said at its launch that the report showed “ *we need to take dramatic action ... we must have the data and evidence we need to design appropriate responses, and to measure our progress. Which is why this report is so important*” \[ **I**\]. 

 In addition to this impact on Walk Free, SA changed the policies and practices of other major NGOs. In interviews about SA, leading antislavery NGOs explained the benefit of SA’s input to multiple NGO projects and programmes that now were “ *shaped and guided by those with lived experience*” \[ **J**\]. For example, access to survivor expertise via SA shifted NGOs’ work in new directions, helped them identify new areas of focus and stop other programmes, and shaped the design and delivery of multiple major antislavery programmes \[ **J**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Parkes’ and Unterhalter’s programme of research, undertaken at UCL Institute of Education, has helped to create and sustain more gender\-equitable, safe schools, with far\-reaching effects on the safety and well\-being of girls and boys in schools across eight countries in Africa where the research has been focused. The work has influenced global and national agencies, governments and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\), strengthening the ways in which gender equality in education is understood and evaluated, through the generation of robust data, and the use of rigorous research evidence to enhance global, national and local policy and practice. The research has influenced the release of long term funding of GBP800,000,000 for implementation projects. Young people in any more countries in the continent and beyond have benefited as programmes are rolled out through agencies.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research addresses challenges of gender inequalities and violence in education through collaborations with global organisations, governments, NGOs and researchers in Africa. While there has been considerable attention in research and policy to getting girls into school, this focus has neglected the gender relations and intersecting inequalities in school and out of school that differentially affect particular groups of girls’ vulnerability to marginalisation, discrimination and violence. Policies on girls’ education developed at national or international levels have often been transmitted in linear top\-down ways, with little engagement with, or insights into, perspectives and practices in schools and communities. The research has addressed these weaknesses through, firstly, analysing and conceptualising the complexity of gender and other inequalities in education, and secondly, through collaborating extensively with multiple partners to co\-produce evidence to inform policy and practice. The research findings have been shared in over 70 publications since 2005 \(including over 40 journal articles, 20 research reports and 10 books\). The research programme featured three key projects highlighted below. 

 **Accountability for gender equality in education \(AGEE\)** \(GBP442,704\): A 4\-year study \(2018–21\), led by Unterhalter, jointly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) and the UK Department for International Development \(DFID, now Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office \(FCDO\)\) which aimed to develop an indicator framework in education supporting the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\) and government initiatives on gender equality in education **\(R1\)**. Unterhalter and her team developed a gender equality in education monitoring ‘dashboard’ \( **R1**, figure 6\) and convened a community of practice on indicators for gender equality in education, involving the United Nations Girls Education Initiative \(UNGEI\) and UNESCO. The data collection, which included interviews and workshops with National Statistical Offices, governments and women’s rights activists in Malawi and South Africa, examined the effectiveness and feasibility of the dashboard. 

 This research builds on findings from Unterhalter’s ESRC funded study: *Gender, Education and Global Policy Reduction Initiatives* \(2007–11\) and on the DFID funded *Rigorous Review of Evidence on Girls’ Education and Gender Equality* **\(R2\)** which showed a disconnection between the aspirations of global policies and the interpretation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects. Global Policy Reduction Initiatives’ research methods involved case studies in Kenya and South Africa, with interviews, observations, and document analysis in the national Department/Ministry of Education, a provincial department, a school, a local and a global NGO. 

 <ins>Key findings/insights</ins>: Gender inequality outside schools and education systems has consequences for institutional arrangements within education systems **\(R2, R3\)**. There is a need to identify and join up the work of all stakeholders involved and develop monitoring and evaluation to review these relationships **\(R3\)**. 

 **End Gender Violence in Schools** GBP708,960: An action research project in Zambia, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire and Togo between 2014–17, led by Parkes, with UNICEF and funded by the Global Partnership for Education. This research used evidence as set out below to strengthen policy and practice on school\-related gender\-based violence \(SRGBV\). Following a global literature review, scoping data were collected through 20 to 30 in\-depth stakeholder interviews in each country; workshops and analyses of research, policy and programme texts to evaluate prevalence and patterns of SRGBV; analysis of laws, policies and plans, structures and partnerships, responses in and around schools, prevention through teaching and learning, and systems for data collection. Findings from these studies informed the development and implementation of action plans by country teams led by Education Ministries. Research outputs included a rigorous review of global evidence **\(R4\)**; 4 country scoping studies of policy, practice and evidence on SRGBV, cross\-country analysis, and 2 qualitative studies **\(R5\)**. 

 <ins>Key findings/insights:</ins> The research identified how interventions to address SRGBV were often piecemeal, with policy enactment hampered by political, conceptual and resource challenges at all levels of the education sector **\(R4\)**. This was exemplified in the study in Ethiopia, with patchy implementation of policy across the country, and low levels of reporting or follow up in schools **\(R5\)**. Based on the evidence collected, Parkes and her team developed a multi\-dimensional SRGBV framework that addresses the causes and consequences of violence in norms and inequalities, through ‘whole school’ approaches, with participatory engagement of students and staff, and stress on interconnectedness with families, communities, services and local\-mid\-national policy environments \( **R4**, figure 1\). 

 **Good Schools Study** \(2012–2015\) and the **Contexts of Violence in Adolescence Cohort Study \(COVAC\)** \(2018–2022\): Raising Voices, a Ugandan NGO, developed the Good School Toolkit. The objective of the Good Schools Study research was to evaluate whether the Toolkit  reduced physical violence from school staff to students, with methods including a randomised control trial in 42 schools and qualitative interviews and focus groups **\(R6\)**. The COVAC study is a long\-term follow up of participants in the Good Schools Study. It is a mixed methods cohort project, with 3 waves of epidemiological survey data collection, and four waves of qualitative longitudinal data collection, providing detailed insights into how adolescents’ violence\-related experiences, perspectives and practices relate to their social contexts and how these change over time. The research, funded by the Medical Research Council, is a collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Raising Voices, with Parkes leading the qualitative longitudinal study. 

 <ins>Key findings/insights</ins>: The violence prevention intervention \- the Good Schools Toolkit \- reduced violence in schools by 42 per cent over 18 months and improved children’s sense of well\-being and connection to schools. The studies identified characteristics of whole school interventions that can generate more equitable, safe schools, including engaging school staff and students in reflection and action to strengthen alternative non\-violent approaches to discipline. They also addressed questions about sustainability, as young people move to secondary schools or out of schools **\(R6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Parkes and Unterhalter has re\-focused global policy \(FCDO, UNICEF, UNGEI\) to address gender inequality and violence in education. The research has contributed to a\) the ways governments are making and implementing policies in Africa; b\) decisions to greatly increase funding for this work; c\) the development of evidence\-informed programmes, and d\) strengthening approaches to monitoring progress on gender and violence prevention in the education sector. As a consequence, the work has had far\-reaching effects on the safety and well\-being of young people in schools in and beyond Africa, confirmed by two senior officials who worked closely with the team on the development and application of the research findings: 

 ‘*Professor Unterhalter and Parkes engagement has helped put girls’ education at the top of DFID’s agenda and their research has been key to influencing DFID’s policy, spending and programming priorities towards girls’ education. Their work has been central to DFID achieving its objective of getting all children learning*’ \( **S1** Head of Education Research, FCDO \(formerly DfID\). 

 ‘*Regarding measuring gender equality in education, IOE has had a significant impact on the manner in which the global community defines, frames admonitors gender equality in education*’ \( **S2** Head of United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative, UNGEI\). 

 The research has built partnerships with policy makers and practitioners to strengthen the evidence. For example, in the End Gender Violence in Schools project **\(R5\)**, Parkes and her team engaged the Ministry of Education in Ethiopia and UNICEF in the research through workshops to design the study and reflect on the findings. This led to revision of their Code of Conduct to Prevent SRGBV and to developing an action plan to prioritise a series of policy changes to ensure better outcomes, informed by the recommendations **\(S3\)**. It included action to improve coordination between government bodies responsible for education, justice, health and social protection, so that cases are handled with more sensitivity and accountability, and more children are encouraged to report their experiences. It also involved improved training for teachers to help them better understand and address inequitable norms and stigma linked to SRGBV. These improvements are being rolled out across the country, affecting 20,800,000 children in primary and 2,600,000 in secondary school, with intensive work taking place in two states \(Amhara and Addis Ababa\), improving safety and wellbeing for 5,800,000 children \(Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Ministry of Education, 2017\). 

 In Uganda, the collaboration throughout all stages of the COVAC research, including a recent workshop reflecting on emerging findings with stakeholders from government and NGOs, was described by the head of a lead NGO as: ‘ *an example of how researchers can enhance the practical work of NGOs by sharing research skills, real time analysis of data and how it can inform refinement of interventions*’ **\(S4\)**. The Good Schools study findings **\(R6\)** increased understanding of how to work with whole school communities to reduce corporal punishment and enabled the NGO to take a leading role in supporting the scaling up of this school\-based violence prevention intervention, in collaboration with government and civil society organisations. In their testimonial, the NGO confirms that this has led to safer environments in more than 1000 schools, benefitting an estimated 750,000 children in Uganda **\(S4\)**. 

 The research findings have been taken up and shared through a range of tools that are influencing the work of organisations and governments on gender and violence around the world. Guidance stemming from the research on working with school communities to address SRGBV **\(R3\)** features in learning resources targeting policy makers and practitioners globally \- UNGEI’s Thematic Briefs on Ending SRGBV **\(S2, S5\)**, and Apolitical’s Field Guide to Safer Schools **\(S6\)**. The findings have advanced work with UNGEI and UNICEF on minimal standards for and monitoring of a whole school approach to prevent and respond to SRGBV **\(S7** p.6 **\)**. The Minimum Standards guide sets out a global framework to help governments and NGOs across the world ensure and monitor gender equity and safety in schools. 

 The research team worked closely with DFID, supporting the production of their ‘REDNote’, which sets out evidence\-based guidance on how to work on school violence. This engagement ensured that DFID put ‘whole school approaches’ at the centre of their work **\(S1, R4\)**. DFID education advisors in over 17 countries in Africa and Asia have subsequently reviewed policies and programmes and oriented towards using whole school approaches, including creating dialogue with government and NGO partners about how to do this: ‘ *Drawing on work of both Jenny Parkes and Elaine Unterhalter our 2018 Education Policy has committed to strengthening our engagement at every level in the system to ensure gender issues are addressed*’ **\(S1\)**. The research has also influenced decisions to make a very significant funding commitment to this area: ‘ *This includes the development of a new programme providing significant £300m of new funding for policy change and programming in this area*’ **\(S1\)**. 

 The research is helping to improve the ways gender equality and SRGBV are addressed, monitored and evaluated in education. Unterhalter’s scholarship on conceptualising gender equality in education and her focus on marginalisation **\(R2, R3\)** has ‘ *substantially influenced*’ **\(S8\)** DFID’s Girls’ Education Challenge \(GEC\) programmes, such that they are targeted on addressing multiple forms of marginalisation ‘ *We drew on recommendations to ensure analyses of exclusion look at intersecting inequalities associated with contexts, power dynamics and risks of sexual violence*’ **\(S8\)**. This has influenced the delivery of programmes totalling GBP500m **\(S1\)**, with testimonials evidencing how her monitoring framework has been mainstreamed across programmes and is ‘ *estimated to have reached 1,317,695 direct beneficiaries*’ across 41 projects in 17 countries **\(S8\)**. UNESCO’s 2018 Gender Review **\(S9\)** reframed its approach to accountability using Unterhalter’s conceptualisations of gender \(p.37\). Its approach cites her framework to identify the need to incorporate additional dimensions, including scrutiny of power relations and normative aspirations on justice and equality beyond education \(p.10\). 

 The AGEE research has been instrumental in building a community of practice among key organisations engaged with measuring aspects of inequalities and equalities associated with education, including the UN Development Programme \(UNDP\), Oxfam, LSE Equality project and UNESCO, and with government and NGO partners in South Africa and Malawi. The ‘dashboard’ of indicators on gender and education **\(R1\)** was introduced into the G7 endorsed Gender at the Centre Initiative ‘ *to guide the integration of gender into education analysis across the 8 partner countries in Africa*’ **\(S2\)**. The dashboard has been ‘ *fully integrated into the Global Education Monitoring Report Gender Review, which is the global authority on education around the world*’ **\(S2, S9\)**, and is being used by UNESCO to monitor progress towards the education targets in the SDGs; and to shape the global database used in its annual monitoring: ‘ *this innovative approach \[that\] not only helps improve our monitoring of progress towards gender equality in and through education, but also to monitor changes in existing laws and policies*’ **\(S10\)**. The studies on the policies, institutions and politics of gender and education **\(R1, R3, R5\)** have helped to refine UNGEI’s capacity development and advocacy work on Gender Responsive Education Sector Planning, through a series of workshops with key government officials from over 27 countries in Africa and Asia, working to formulate education sector plans that eliminate discrimination **\(S2\)**. 

 In sum, Parkes’ and Unterhalter’s research has contributed to improving gender equality and violence prevention in schools. Their findings have influenced major funding bodies to inject funding of approx. GBP800,000,000 to support innovative research\-informed programmes. Working with well\-established and collaborative partnerships at global, national and local levels, the work has helped to improve policies, practices and research that support school communities and education systems in Africa and beyond, to create safer and more equitable learning environments for young people and their teachers.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Assessing the population’s diet is essential for monitoring public health and evaluating the impact of campaigns, but traditional methods are time\-consuming, impractical and expensive. Newcastle University therefore developed Intake24, an accurate and user\-friendly online food diary. Users input their food intake over the past 24 hours and the system automatically codes their responses, providing substantial time and cost savings. A major innovation, Intake24 was used by Public Health England to assess the Government’s “Sugar Smart” campaign, saving around £250,000. It was recently adopted into the National Diet and Nutrition Survey to assess population dietary intake across the UK, and has been used by Coeliac UK to assess the intakes of 1,000 people following a gluten\-free diet. Intake24 was also used to assess the diets of 16,000 participants in Denmark and Portugal, saving £50,000. A successful pilot of Intake24 in the 2018/19 Scottish Health Survey led Food Standards Scotland to adopt the system for subsequent surveys.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Unmet need</ins> 

 Government agencies such as Public Health England \(PHE\) monitor the population’s dietary intake for risk assessment, appropriate targeting of nutrition\-related policies and to monitor the outcome of campaigns. To calculate the constituent nutrients of a diet, accurate portion size measurement is crucial. Although the most accurate measure is a weighed food diary, their completion requires substantial subject training and motivation. This considerable burden reduces participation and completion rates, resulting in lower quality data. In addition, coding and analysis of the diaries requires considerable time, expertise and cost. Newcastle therefore developed Intake24, an accurate and user\-friendly system where users input the food and drink that they remember eating over the past 24 hours \(a “recall”\), and the system automatically records the nutritional composition and gram weight of each item. 

 <ins>The development of Intake24</ins> 

 The research began by comparing three tools that improve the accuracy of portion size estimation: food photographs, food models and a novel interactive portion size assessment system developed by Newcastle \(R1\). This system allows the user to scroll through photographs of real foods depicting various portion sizes, select the image that most closely represents what they ate and indicate any food left over. Estimates using the system were closer to the actual weight and nutrient content of food eaten than the photographs or models, and showed the least variability. 

 The next study \(R2\) improved the original system and expanded the range of food types to 104 and images to over 1,300, including the top 100 from the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey. The updated system showed good accuracy and fair precision compared to 4\-day weighed intakes. 

 Having established sufficient accuracy, the next step was to develop a computerised system, now known as Intake24. This iteration of the system \(R3\) included adaptations to enable self\-completion, such as a search function and instructions to add meals, snacks and drinks consumed the previous day. 

 Intake24 was further developed with four cycles of iterative feedback from users \(R4 and R5\). The search function was refined to recognise misspelt words, brand names, phonetic spelling and phonemes, and added cues such as requesting further detail when the user provided insufficient information. Since the system was intended to monitor population diet, large\-scale availability was a key feature and it was therefore developed to allow online access. The system was compared to interviewer\-led 24\-hour recalls, considered by many as the gold standard of dietary assessment, and was found to provide estimates of energy intake that were just 1% lower on average than the interviewer\-led recall. In addition, 85% of all foods and drinks recorded were an exact match. Using an industry\-standard System Usability Scale to measure user friendliness, the system was rated as 83/100 where over 80 is considered excellent**Footnote:**

 Bangor et al. 2009 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2835587.2835589 
. The ease of completing Intake24 and minimal training required improves participants’ motivation and therefore completion rates. 

 Finally, the system was field tested with participants aged 11 to 65\+ years who had previously taken part in the Scottish Health Survey \(R6\). Of the 132 participants who completed four or more recalls, over 80% agreed that Intake24 was easy to follow and understand, and completion took an average of 14 minutes. There were only a small number of requests for help, of which the vast majority were resolved in less than 10 minutes. 

 This iterative development with user feedback allowed the development of a powerful, intuitive and accurate system suitable for use in national surveys of population diet. Its adoption into such surveys is described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Advantages of Intake24</ins> 

 The main advantage offered by Intake24 \(available at  [intake24.co.uk](http://intake24.co.uk/)\) is removing the need for a trained nutritionist to visit the participant’s home to conduct an interview, which typically lasts an hour, and then code this information, which can take a further hour. Using this online system also avoids the need for planning the logistics of these visits, therefore offering substantial savings in terms of cost and time. For the participant, Intake24 offers convenience, as the recalls can be completed at a time and place suitable for them, and do not have to be completed in one go. The reduced burden may increase participants’ motivation to complete the recall and also discourage them from changing their dietary intake to facilitate recording. Another related advantage of Intake24 is that it removes social desirability bias, where a participant answers in a manner that would be viewed favourably by others, since there is no interviewer present. The system can also provide immediate dietary feedback to the user, which has been reported to be very useful. Finally, the automatic coding of the data means that accuracy does not vary with the experience and diligence of the researcher. Unlike another UK\-based tool \(myfood24\), Intake24 has adopted all aspects of the US Department of Agriculture’s Automated Multiple Pass Method and is free of charge. 

 <ins>Use of Intake24 to assess UK population dietary intake</ins> 

 To date, Intake24 has been used in four major programmes that assessed the UK population’s diet, providing crucial data to support risk assessment, policy development \(including monitoring and evaluation\) and inform further public health campaigns. 

 The first was the “Sugar Smart” campaign, which ran in early 2016 as part of Change4Life, the Government’s brand to tackle childhood obesity in England. Public Health England \(PHE\) chose Intake24 to assess the campaign as it provided a more rapid and less invasive approach than traditional methods involving face\-to\-face interviews or the collection of blood and urine samples. Intake24 was used to assess around 3,300 diets and allowed PHE to save substantial costs of approximately £250,000 \(EV1\). 

 The second campaign was the National Diet and Nutrition Survey \(NDNS\), a rolling programme established in 2008 to assess UK public diet, nutrient intake and nutritional status. In 2018, NatCen Social Research and the MRC Epidemiology Unit at Cambridge University were awarded the contract to deliver the third wave of the NDNS \(2018–2023\), a pivotal objective of which was to move the survey from a paper food diary to a digital assessment tool. After a detailed review of the methods available, Intake24 stood out as a strong candidate for the NDNS due to published evidence of its usability, validity and performance, its completeness of data collection, ease of use and acceptability to participants, its open\-source nature and the potential for adaptation and customisation \(EV1, EV2\). Further development of Intake24 since 2018 has been undertaken in conjunction with Cambridge University, and in October 2019 it was launched in the NDNS to collect data from 1,200 people over the subsequent year. Fieldwork was suspended in March 2020 with the outbreak of COVID\-19, but early evaluation results were positive \(EV2\). 

 Thirdly, the charity Coeliac UK used Intake24 in the specific Coeliac Diet and Nutrition Survey \(CDNS, EV3\) to assess the diets of people with coeliac disease, following a strictly gluten\-free diet, who were not covered by the NDNS. Using Intake24, a pilot of the CDNS began in 2017 and its success led to full roll\-out in March 2018, with data collection completed in July 2019. During the project, Intake24 was used to collect 1,331 recalls once a day for four days – a total of 5,324 individual recalls. Intake24 allowed Coeliac UK to assess food intake with a larger number of participants more rapidly and at a lower cost than traditional methods. In addition, feedback collected following the most recent phase of the CDNS identified that 88% of respondents found using Intake24 easy or very easy \(EV3\). 

 Finally, Intake24 was piloted by Food Standards Scotland \(FSS\) in 2018/19, assessing a total of 2,112 recalls \(EV4\). Of the 800 respondents that provided feedback in the pilot, 87% felt they were able to complete Intake24 in a reasonable time and 33% said that they would make changes to their diet as a result of completing the recall. The approach taken to integrate Intake24 into the Survey was broadly successful. \(EV5\). The success of this pilot led FSS to take the decision in November 2020 to use Intake24 for the Survey, starting in 2021, with around 2,500 participants per year. 

 <ins>Use in a European study of weight loss maintenance</ins> 

 Intake24 was also used in the NoHow programme to investigate the maintenance of weight loss. NoHow, which ran from March 2017 to October 2019, was an international project involving partners in Denmark, Portugal and the UK. Intake24 was used to assess around 16,000 recalls \(over 5,100 were the English version, over 5,500 the Portuguese version and 5,300 the Danish version\). The system allowed the project to assess food intake more rapidly and less invasively than traditional methods, and offered a cost saving of around £50,000 \(EV6\). Feedback from participants included 60% saying they found it easy to use, and around 38% saying it helped with weight control \(EV7\). 

 <ins>In summary</ins>, Newcastle developed a powerful, accurate and intuitive tool to collect population\-level dietary intake that offers cost savings and reduced respondent burden.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Children in state care are among the most vulnerable in society, nationally and globally. Previous experiences of physical and psychological trauma, loss and separation mean that children require therapeutic care if they are to recover from developmental harm, achieve happy, stable adult lives and fulfil their potential. To guide and support caregivers and professionals in meeting these children’s needs successfully, the free to access Secure Base model of therapeutic caregiving was developed by Professor Schofield and Dr Beek in the School of Social Work at UEA from their highly regarded long\-term fostering research \(published 2000\-12\). The Secure Base model has been widely implemented in child welfare agencies across the UK and internationally, including, since 2014, playing an important role in the development of foster care as an alternative to institutional care in Thailand, China and Ukraine. This research\-based practice model has therefore been instrumental in transforming children’s lives in very diverse cultures and contexts.

 2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research was conducted during a period of serious concerns regarding outcomes for vulnerable children in care in the UK and is still relevant for public policy and social work practice today. The number of children in care has risen 30% from 60,000 in 2006, when the Secure Base model was developed, to 78,000 in 2019. Coming into care can be a positive turning point, but without good quality caregiving children with unresolved trauma and emotional difficulties as a result of previous maltreatment are at risk of placement instability, educational underachievement, poor mental health and youth offending. 

 Four research projects on the care of foster children were led by Professor Gillian Schofield \(PI\), with Dr Mary Beek \(Research fellow\), and funded by the Nuffield Foundation. 

-  *Growing up in foster care*: three linked projects \( **R1**, **R2** and **R3**\) followed a cohort of long\-term foster children and their foster families longitudinally. 

-  *Care planning for long\-term foster care*: the fourth project \( **R4**\), was a cross\-sectional study of a cohort of foster children across six local authorities, their families and support services. 

 These studies have led the field by investigating pathways and outcomes for children with a long\-term foster care plan through to adulthood and combining this with practical applications of attachment theory. The research has been of UK and worldwide significance in offering a positive approach to children growing up in long\-term foster care. 

 UEA research used quantitative and qualitative methods \(developmental measures, analysis of case records, interviews with children, birth parents, foster carers and social workers\) to investigate the quality of relationships in foster placements and the caregiving qualities which enabled children to recover from previous trauma and abuse and fulfil their potential. 

 This research identified five caregiving dimensions which promoted good outcomes in terms of stability, security, identity and emotional well\-being for children from backgrounds of maltreatment and trauma. These dimensions are *availability\-helping the child to trust*, *sensitivity\-helping the child to manage feelings*, *acceptance\-building the child’s self\-esteem*, *co\-operation\-helping the child to feel effective* and *family membership\- helping the child to belong*. The first four dimensions were linked to attachment theory, with UEA research making the important new contribution of both identifying the developmental benefit of each dimension *and* demonstrating how attachment concepts originally relating to infancy in intact families were relevant for older children and adolescents being parented by foster carers. The fifth dimension, family membership, was added, as it is an important psychosocial contribution to a secure base, especially for children in foster care who belong to both foster and birth families. Findings provided valuable additional evidence of how foster family relationships provide a sense of belonging as part of the family, as well as offering the benefits of emotional security. 

 The research identified that the five caregiving dimensions interact; for example, trust is linked to raised self\-esteem, and acceptance is necessary for a child to feel a sense of belonging. Together these dimensions form the Secure Base model, represented in the form of a star, with language that is positive, child focussed and accessible to professionals and carers.

 4. Details of the impact 

 The primary beneficiaries of the UEA Secure Base model have been vulnerable children and adolescents in care in the UK and internationally who need sensitive, therapeutic caregiving to recover from harmful early experiences. The model has enabled foster carers, adopters, residential workers, social workers, teachers and other professionals to identify the needs of vulnerable children more accurately and provide a therapeutic caregiving environment that promotes heathy emotional development, supporting children to fulfil their potential in the family, at school and in pro\-social activities in the community. 

 The Secure Base model was actively taken up in the UK and internationally from 2007, but there was a particular growth in its impact on improving the lives of vulnerable children from 2014–20. This was due to the range of new materials available \(e.g. training programmes\), the diverse practice agencies using the model \(e.g. residential care and schools as well as fostering and adoption\), and new countries embedding the model in practice \(e.g. projects in China, Thailand, Ukraine, in addition to the UK and Europe\). Schofield was awarded an OBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours 2020, with the Department for Education recognising her ‘ *outstanding contribution to children, families and social work, including developing the Secure Base model, a framework for understanding and caring for children who have been affected by abuse.*’ **\(S1\)** 

 **Impact on policy and practice in the UK** 

-  **Developing and improving caregiving training and practice** 

 UEA’s Secure Base model provided an authoritative, research based, practical framework that has enabled social workers, foster carers and adopters to apply complex attachment theory. ‘ *The Secure Base Model has established itself as a key framework and tool for social workers and other professionals…The model has undoubtedly been one of the most influential developments for* \[the\] *child placement sector over the last 6 years...’,* \(CoramBAAF Director of Policy, Research and Development\). **\(S2\)** 

 Following the recommendation of the Secure Base model by the Department for Education and Skills in the White Paper, *Care Matters* \(2007:44\), the Fostering Network \(the national organisation for UK foster carers\) commissioned Schofield and Beek to include the Secure Base model in the revised core training *Skills to Foster* \(2009, 2014\) thus benefitting all new foster carers. **\(S3\)** 

 The UEA *Providing a Secure Base* website made updated practice materials available free of charge in the UK and internationally from 2008. The addition of detailed training programmes to the website \(2015\) enabled agencies to deliver training direct to foster carers, adopters and social workers, increasing the reach. The website has been widely accessed e.g. 85,846 hits in 2017/18 \(Google analytics\). 

 Since 2014, a wider range of fostering, adoption and residential care providers in the statutory and voluntary sector in the UK report have benefitted from the Secure Base model, as below. Schofield and Beek have supported these developments, including holding Annual Secure Base Network meetings in London, with agencies attending from all four UK countries. 

-  **Local authority implementation of the Secure Base to improve outcomes** \(S4\)** 

 Local authorities have implemented the Secure Base model, including at policy level across children’s services e.g. the **London Borough of Southwark** Director of Children’s Services made the model one of their three policy ‘pillars’, with Schofield launching it in 2014 to an audience of 250 professionals and caregivers. In 2017 the Director concluded, ‘ *Secure Base implementation has been observed and based on feedback is having a really positive impact on supporting foster carers and enabling them to provide greater empathy, understanding, sense of belonging, support and stability to the children they look after.’* 

 Local authorities have been creative in implementing the model e.g. **West Sussex** Children’s Services delivered the Secure Base training programme to staff and carers, set up Secure Base workshops and established a Secure Base stories library, some written by children. The practice tools had good feedback. A trainer reported: ‘ *The Secure Base Checklist has been very well received... because carers agree that it very quickly “paints a picture of a child/young person”’.* 

 Local authorities have committed resources to support successful implementation e.g. **Manchester Children’s Services**, Southwark and West Sussex, all created designated staff posts for implementing the Secure Base model. A review of Manchester’s fostering services 2017/18 concluded: ‘ *There is an ongoing focus on rolling out Secure Base training to our foster carer pool over the reporting year... Feedback... from foster carers so far has been very positive about the impact the training has had on their ability to meet children’s complex needs.’* 

-  **Independent agencies using Secure Base to improve fostering and residential care** \(S5\)** 

 Successful embedding of the model to improve caregiving was described by **Acorn Care**, an independent fostering agency. ‘ *At the Acorns we use the Secure Base model to focus on each and every interaction that occurs between our caregivers and children/young people that we work with. The Secure Base model also helps us consider how these relationships can enable the child to develop competence in the outside world of school, peer group and community.’* 

 Schofield has worked since 2016 with clinical psychologists, staff and carers at **Family Care**, a fostering and therapeutic residential care provider. Their website highlights the value of the Secure Base model in providing ‘ *a framework for therapeutic caregiving which builds resilience and helps infants, children and young people move towards greater security’*. 

 Ofsted have recognised the role of the Secure Base model in providing high quality care.  **ABC Fostering**, an independent fostering agency, which consulted with Beek and Schofield on implementation of the Secure Base model, was awarded ‘outstanding’ in 2016 and the Ofsted report concluded: ‘ *Children and young people benefit from foster carers who understand the service’s ‘Secure Base’ model and use it in their everyday parenting’.* An ABC foster carer said of the model: ‘ *I see examples of its success every day’.* 

 From 2014 children’s homes providers also started to use the Secure Base model as a framework for therapeutic caregiving \(e.g. **Ryes College**, **New Reflexions\)** in consultation with Schofield. 

-  **New UEA applications in adoption, schools and support for professional staff** \(S6\)** 

 The Secure Base model has provided the foundation for the child\-centred **UEA Moving to Adoption** practice framework \(Beek, Neil and Schofield, 2018\-20, funded by Sir Halley Stewart Foundation\), now adopted by **Regional Adoption Agencies** in England. A fostering social worker commented on its effectiveness in an evaluation: ‘ *Applying* \[the Secure Base model\] *enabled us to see the foster carers as a secure base \- for both the children and adoptive parents’*. 

 Schofield and Beek were funded by the Alex Timpson Trust \(2018\-20\) to develop **Providing a Secure Base in Schools** training programmes to help school staff to support vulnerable children. The **Norfolk Virtual School Head** commissioned UEA to deliver these training programmes in Norfolk \(2019\-20\). They were well received by teaching staff in their evaluations. *‘The Secure Base model is a good model to reflect upon every day to ensure good practice around attachment.’* ‘ *The explanation of different behaviours that children might show due to lack of a secure base and what we can do to help them manage those feelings and deal with those situations was helpful.’* 

 The **Team as Secure Base** framework was developed by Dr Laura Biggart \(UEA\) \(2015\-17\), in partnership with Beek and Schofield, to promote emotional resilience in staff supporting carers and children. In 2017 it was incorporated in the Operating Framework for **Cafcass \(Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service\)** \(1325 social workers\). The model is also an important part of the new **Practice Supervisor Development Programme** *,* an investment by the Department for Education in training for new social work supervisors \(1000 staff in 2019\-20\). 

 **International implementation and impact of the Secure Base model** 

 Schofield and Beek have provided training and support for implementation of the Secure Base model globally, including **Australia, China, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Thailand**, **Ukraine** and **Vietnam**. The *Attachment Handbook* has been translated into **French** and **Italian**, and is being translated into **Greek**, **Japanese** and **Russian.** Online training resources are widely accessed e.g. by 20 different countries in 2018. 

-  **Promoting high\-quality foster care in Europe** \(S7\)** 

 The Secure Base / ‘Trygg Base’ model has been part of **Norway’s** core training for new foster carers since 2008 and used in supervision of carers and staff. Schofield visited Norway biannually during this successful implementation \(2007\-12\) and in 2014 was invited to hold a day workshop for 300 practitioners and foster carers in Oslo. The practice guide was translated into Norwegian \(2015\) and Secure Base foster carer support groups have continued in Norway to 2020. 

 New agencies in Europe continue to approach UEA e.g. from 2020 **Cornerstones Fostering**, in the Netherlands, are implementing the model throughout their organisation, with consultation from Schofield, and have reported, *‘...experiences with Secure Base Teams are very positive and social workers and care professionals feel connected and empowered in their work*.’ 

-  **Deinstitutionalisation in Asia and Europe through developing foster care** \(S8\)** 

 UNICEF estimated in 2017 that at least 2.7 million children were in institutional care. Since 2013 the Secure Base model has been used to support the international goal of de\-institutionalisation. From 2013\-15, Beek worked in **Thailand**, **China** and **Vietnam** with Care for Children, a UK based charity, to develop training materials used by local staff to recruit, train and support local foster carers to care for children. These training programmes have continued in use to 2020. 

 In **Thailand**, the Secure Base model became part of their core foster care training programme, with 29 \(of a total of 30\) government child welfare homes and 786 staff attending Secure Base workshops, including teachers, nurses, psychologists, social workers and government officials. Trainers used a culturally sensitive representation of the Secure Base model to communicate to Thai foster carers. This training has also benefited children in institutional care as well as children moving to foster care, with a residential staff member commenting: ‘ *I learnt a lot in this workshop and I’m going to change the way I care for the children because of it. I know we will be able to use it with the children in the orphanage and when we are giving advice to foster parents.’* 

 In **China**, the Secure Base model became widely used by Care for Children. In 2016, the year after Beek completed work on training programmes, 30 workshops were delivered by local trainers in cities across China for 1,310 foster carers, residential staff and professionals and is now well established. In 2014, the Secure Base model was extended to **Vietnam** and presented by Beek to 200 participants \(government officials, orphanage directors, child protection managers\) at a Conference in Hanoi organized by the Ministry of Labour, Invalid and Social Affairs, UNICEF and Care for Children, chaired by Prince Michael of Kent. The model has been implemented in training local staff, with child welfare homes pioneering the introduction of foster care in Vietnam. 

 From 2016, after consultation with Beek, the Secure Base model was introduced by **Care in Action**, a German based charity, in **Ukraine**, where foster care is promoted as an alternative to institutional care. Care in Action describe this approach on its website \(2019 *\). ‘We have equipped specialists across Ukraine with the internationally recognised Providing a Secure Base model of care, so they can train and support foster parents. Because when children are well cared for they develop the relationships and abilities that will help them to succeed at life.’* Also on the website is a foster carer’s comment: *“After the training I began to analyse myself, my actions and S’s behaviour, and began to change my attitudes. With understanding and calm we found a solution.”* 

 Beek was consulted by colleagues in **India**, after which the Centre of Excellence in the Alternative Care of Children and the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, recommended the Secure Base model in their first national **User Guide on Foster Care \(2018\). 

-  **The** **Secure Base model applied to schools internationally** \(S9\)** 

 Schofield and Beek provided Secure Base training and development in Melbourne \(2016\-17\), influencing foster care, but also education, as this teacher reported: ‘ *The teaching and support staff here have enthusiastically grasped your model and are excitedly developing pragmatic ways in which to engage with our students and help them to trust and feel safe while they are here… we are already seeing results which are observable in our behaviour and attendance records.’*

 1. Summary of the impact 

 In sub\-Saharan African countries like Uganda, smallholder farmers face frequent, severe droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, intensified in recent years because of climate change. These hazards are compounded by plant pests and poor\-quality seed. UEA research into how Uganda’s smallholder farmers perceive risk led to the development of a new agricultural insurance scheme, a public\-private partnership. The scheme now protects about 200,000 smallholder farmers against the major risks to their livelihoods, with demand rapidly rising. This boosts productivity by providing smallholders with the confidence to invest in their farms. Insured farmers increase investment by 60\-100%, which offers a safe way out of poverty and is an important step towards food security for the country. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Sustainably raising agricultural productivity is essential for food security and poverty reduction, especially in sub\-Saharan Africa. This requires substantial investment among farmers, most of them smallholders. In Uganda 1 in 5 of the population of 45 million live in extreme poverty, with poverty concentrated among the 70 per cent whose livelihoods depend on agriculture. Almost all of Uganda’s farmers farm less than 2.5 hectares of land. Underinvestment in farms means food insecurity and poverty keep their productivity low, and farmers on the edge of survival. They face hazards such as droughts, erratic rainfall due to climate change, locust attacks, and counterfeit or damaged seed which fails to germinate. 

 Since 2004 a team from the University of East Anglia led research in Uganda on how farmers cope with these risk factors. Almost 3,000 farmers have taken part in economic experiments and surveys. Together with in\-depth interviews with local experts on agriculture, this provided new insights about how farmers decide on taking risks and how they share risks. 

  

 The first UEA research insight is that farmers only invest what they can afford to lose \[R1, R2 and R3 in Section 3\]. When considering buying better seed or other inputs, they often limit their investment to the cash they have spare. They avoid taking out loans because drought wipes out their harvests approximately one year in six. This means loans cannot be repaid, the bank appropriates their land, and they lose their main livelihood. For farmers on the edge of survival, investment decisions are a matter of life and death. 

 The second UEA research insight is that farmers typically support each other when one of them has a specific need, such as a failed investment. Paradoxically, this discourages investment, as farmers prefer not to expose their peers to their own risks \[R4\].

 4. Details of the impact 

 Together, the two UEA research insights described in Section 2 suggested a specific role for agricultural insurance. Informal insurance \(mutual support\) discourages investment, which points to a role for formal insurance \[R4\]. Formal agricultural insurance could encourage investment, provided all major risks are included \[R1, R2 and R3\]. Yet crop insurance is usually unfeasible for smallholder farmers due to the high costs of claim verification. Weather index insurance \(whereby compensation is based on a weather index correlated with crop growing conditions\) is more feasible, but still leaves major risks such as pests and counterfeit seed uninsured. UEA research thus pointed to weather insurance combined \(‘bundled’\) with protection against these other risks \[S1 and S2 in Section 5\]. 

 Building on these insights, UEA researchers co\-produced risk management solutions, working with government officials, farmers and insurance companies, in three stages of research dissemination described below. These risk management solutions make use of satellite images to offer farmers insurance against droughts and erratic rainfall. Inspired by the UEA research, weather insurance is now offered together with certified seed and other agricultural inputs, so that the major risk factors are taken care of. This gives farmers confidence to invest and provides them with a safe way out of poverty. 

 **Impact 1: The government of Uganda decides to promote agricultural investment through bundled weather index insurance.** 

 **In the first research dissemination stage, UEA research insights were discussed with farmers, field specialists and representatives of government, NGOs and the private sector: about 50 individual meetings between March 2012 and June 2015 and four workshops attended by c.100 people \[S1\]. The discussions focused on the agricultural inputs that weather insurance should be ‘bundled’ with, so that the major risks to crop growing are protected against, and loans for high\-productivity agriculture can be taken out with confidence \[S1, S2\].** A best\-practice analysis of UEA research in Uganda was commissioned by the DFID\-ESRC Growth Research Programme \(DEGRP\) to help other researchers see how they might enhance the impact of their own work. It found that the collaborative, iterative approach taken by UEA researchers helped *‘boost the standing of smallholder farmers in Ugandan policy discussions’* \[S5, p. 8\] and provided evidence to bolster the mission of the country’s leading agricultural consultancy, AT Uganda who set out to promote agricultural innovation in Uganda \[S5, pp. 10\-11\]. This paved the way for the policy impact that resulted for the period 2015\-2020. 

 **In the second research dissemination stage, UEA researchers worked with the Ugandan policy advocacy network PASIC \(Policy Action for Sustainable Intensification of Cropping Systems\), who have a desk in the Ministry of Agriculture, to identify and approach the relevant government officials for influencing policy. This led to the two main government agricultural policy documents for 2015\-2020, the main one of which is the Agricultural Sector Strategic Plan, to draw on UEA research to advocate ‘bundled’ weather index insurance for promoting agricultural investment. The former Senior Policy Analyst for the Ministry of Agriculture, wrote to Verschoor,** ‘“In the original draft of the Agricultural Sector Strategic Plan 2015/6\-20, promoting weather index insurance had not been mentioned as one of the five core activities that will be implemented within the Uganda Climate Smart Agriculture. As a result of your research recommendations, weather index insurance has been incorporated in the final draft. This would not have been possible if you had not shared with us your research recommendations as this provided the necessary evidence to lobby for these changes. \[T\]he role that weather index insurance can play in facilitating the transition \[…\] to progressive farming strategies is \[…\] appearing on Uganda’s policy frameworks on agriculture for the first time as a result of your research recommendations’ \[S3\]. 

 This policy impact required intensive engagement with farmers, field specialists, government officials, insurance experts and other stakeholders. Experts on evidence\-based policy making have noted that the collaborative nature of this approach facilitated impact. The head of the Research and Policy in Development \(RAPID\) programme at the UK’s Overseas Development Institute, writes in a 2019 blog ‘ *A project on farmers’ attitudes towards risk in Uganda \[…\] developed a highly collaborative, iterative approach to engagement, working with farmers, as well as local and national policy makers to co\-create policy proposals that would work at all levels’* \[S4\]. 

 The agriculture theme lead at the DFID\-ESRC Growth Research Programme \(DEGRP\), comments on the unusual care UEA researchers took to tease out policy relevance of their findings: *‘In this case, however, we have a rarity. The study used experimental economics to elicit farmer perceptions of risks in agricultural investment. The researchers next discussed their findings with farmers and field specialists in the locality where they carried out their studies to identify possible practical implications. Then they took those insights to a national dialogue with government, non\-government, donor, academia and private sector stakeholders to consider what might be feasible and promising nationally. So unusual is this process that we asked the team to document in detail what they did’* \[Foreword to S1, p.3\]. 

 **Impact 2: Ugandan insurance companies provide improved weather insurance, with about 200,000 farmers insured in 2020.** 

 **After including the recommendations suggested by UEA research in its 2015\-20 strategy documents, in 2016 the Ugandan government partnered with the Uganda Insurers Association to launch a new agricultural insurance scheme. Ten insurance companies formed the Agriculture Insurance Consortium \(AIC\) to provide the bundled weather insurance that UEA research recommended. The insurance premium is subsidised by the government: smallholder farmers pay 50% of the commercial rate in most of the country, and 20% in particularly drought\-prone areas. By June 2020, 196,991 policies had been sold \[S6\], which is a remarkably rapid market penetration. AIC estimates demand to be 220,000 by the end of 2020 and predicts demand to rise to over 575,000 insured farmers by 2025 \[S6\].** 

 **A Consortium Officer to the AIC explains in a letter to Verschoor what this means for farmers:** “ *To give you a sense of what that means, a typical smallholder farmer insures a harvest value of 250,000 Uganda shillings. The premium on that is 5.5% for weather index insurance and after the subsidy is 2.75%, which comes to 6,875 Uganda shillings. If the satellite shows that a drought causes complete harvest failure, then the farmer will receive 90% of 250,000 Uganda shillings, which is 225,000 Uganda shillings.*” \[S6\] The premium that the farmer pays for protection against drought and ruinous harvest failure of UGX6,875 is 3% of the insurance pay\-out of UGX225,000 received. That pay\-out restores the farmer’s income from crops to 90% of its normal value of UGX250,000. It follows that farmers considering an agricultural investment no longer need to worry about drought. 

 **Impact 3: Insured farmers increase investment by 60\-100%, a safe way out of poverty.** 

 **In the third stage of research dissemination, UEA researchers advised Ugandan insurance companies on the design of new insurance products, focusing on features that, in accordance with UEA research, will encourage smallholder farmers to invest. Insurance company MUA is one of the biggest providers of the new insurance products in Uganda, having insured more than 60,000 farmers to date \[S7\]. MUA’s Head of Agriculture Insurance has assessed the effects on farmers’ investment of the bundled weather insurance products UEA research recommended. She estimates that insured farmers increase investment by between 60 and 100 percent and links this to UEA research: “ **Your research on agricultural investment helped show which kinds of insurance products would be appealing to farmers**” \[S7\].** 

 **An illustration of this is provided by a farmer in Bunamwamba village in Bwikhonge sub county in the Ugandan Bulambuli district, who purchased the new insurance that UEA research recommended. As he puts it, “ **From my perspective, \[the new\] agriculture insurance is beneficial to us farmers because it enables us to borrow money from financial institutions and invest in farming without worrying. When you borrow money to invest in farming and there is a drought, you lose twice; you lose the crops, and you have to sell one of your assets to pay the money you borrowed. But if you have agriculture insurance, it will pay the money you borrowed.**” \[S8, p.12\]** 

 The future looks bright for the new insurance products that UEA research recommended and helped make possible. m\-Omulimisa, a Ugandan agriculture technology company, has started providing the new insurance products in innovative ways, with equally promising effects on investment. Its Managing Director writes to Verschoor: “ *We have developed an app that makes purchase of index insurance extremely easy. We give farmers the opportunity to buy the insurance together with certified, high\-quality agricultural inputs such as seed and fertilizer, as well as to take out an affordable loan \(1.08% interest per month\) for buying these inputs. To make sure that small\-scale farmers are reached, we use a village\-agent model. The village agents have a smart phone that they use to buy bundled insurance \(insurance plus the other things mentioned\) on behalf of the farmers. The model works well. We estimate that farmers double their investment in agricultural inputs as a result of the insurance, which means that the productivity of their farms increases in a safe and sustainable manner.*” \[S9\] 

 *Recognition of outstanding impact* 

 For the UEA research impacts described in this case study, D’Exelle and Verschoor won the prestigious 2020 ESRC Celebrating Impact Prize for Outstanding Business and Enterprise Impact \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Leicester research led by Dr Robert Dover explores the professionalisation of intelligence communities—specifically in relation to their engagement and use of external expertise. This has influenced national and international intelligence practice. The research has contributed to the creation of officer training in the UK Cabinet Office and National Crime Agency and to training opportunities for government analysts and experts in NATO. Dover’s research has underpinned the formulation internationally of official protocols governing the engagement and management of external subject matter experts, particularly scholars. Moreover, Dover’s research has led to improvements in the use of academic materials in strategic assessments by the UK’s National Crime Agency, the Cabinet Office and NATO, leading to improvements in the identification and mitigation of threat. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Dover, along with his collaborator Michael Goodman \(Kings College, London\), conducted research into the utility of intelligence analysts collaborating with academics and academic materials, to identify where and why this form of collaboration often failed. These issues were highly relevant after the post\-Iraq war Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction. The report concluded that intelligence failures can be mitigated or avoided if a plurality of sources are utilised in producing government intelligence assessments. The 2011 Blackett Review reinforced this position, concluding that the Government was making insufficient use of the intellectual capital of universities and that this, therefore, increased the security risk to the nation.Dover contributed to addressing these issues through research on the professionalisation of intelligence analysis as a government business activity **\[R1, R3\]** by: 

-  encouraging the establishment of a culture that routinely makes use of external expertise and open\-source challenge and puts these on a structured footing; and 

-  developing common training standards and practices across the intelligence community. 

 Dover’s research identified an under\-utilisation of open\-source materials and academic content in intelligence assessments and a corresponding over\-reliance on closed or covertly collected sources. His research analysed the reasons for this under\-utilisation. His conclusions, which have been widely accepted by scholars and practitioners, highlighted fundamental research techniques, resourcing, and a need to change the operating culture. 

 Dover’s research identified analysts’ lack of professional training and understanding as a key barrier to the use of open sources, and his research findings have been used to address these in the form of an intelligence academy **\[R1, R2\]**. Dover’s AHRC\-funded research findings **\[G1\]** explored the incentives and barriers facing intelligence practitioners and academics seeking to work with each other. Dover’s research found an under\-exploitation of positive lessons that could be drawn from intelligence practices, reinforcing the tendency in the sector to focus on operational failure for lessons learned. 

 Dover’s research explored the uptake of knowledge exchange between academics \(and other external experts\) and the intelligence community: in this case, the National Crime Agency, Cabinet Office and NATO. Uniquely, he also researched the protocols governing those exchanges, particularly for the NCA. His research examined the opportunities, as well as the practical and normative barriers to this work. He researched the practical challenges around how to align the expectations of practitioners and scholars, what is reasonable for an academic to produce, and whether the material could be useful in other contexts. The research also addressed the question of whether academic scholarship requires translation for intelligence community audiences **\[R1, R3\]**. 

 Dover’s research critiqued the commonly held notion that intelligence activities and academic activities are necessarily distinct or incompatible **\[R1, R3, R4, R5\]**. Distinctively, he has also critically interrogated the value chain of engagement between academics and practitioners, with considerable access having been granted by two significant intelligence organisations. Dover’s significant contribution has been to identify and explore the areas in which the activities of these two communities are complementary, reinforcing and synergistic and to find ways \(in terms of protocols, appropriate forums and organisational culture\) to bridge this divide. The differences that are to be found tend to be more in the direction of state assets, rather than method, technique or intellectual craft, at the strategic level **\[R1\]**.

 Dover’s major contribution is rooted in: 1\) realising the value that positive lessons from historical cases can bring to current intelligence analysis; and 2\) extending this insight to the positive impacts that can be generated by embedding processes and protocols relating to interchange and exchange between government officials and university scholars, to the benefit of both communities.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Prior to Dover’s work, the intelligence community’s engagement with outside experts occurred in an unstructured and piecemeal fashion, predicated on personal\-professional networks and cold\-call requests by analysts identifying a scholar researching interests related to theirs. This led to misunderstandings and mistakes, as recognised by numerous reviews, as referenced in section 2. Dover’s work addressed these issues through engagement with key stakeholders, particularly the Cabinet Office, National Crime Agency \(NCA\), NATO and Five Eyes Group \(an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK and USA\) and advocated for professionalising the intelligence. 

 In 2016, the NCA invited Dover to write and refine **research\-led internal protocols covering external engagement and the open\-source challenge**. 

 *“In coproducing the NCA Protocols for officers to engage external expertise, Dr Dover helped to change our professional practice . . . aligning our expectations with those of external experts and how we engage them in our work. This new protocol helped my analysts bring in more external expertise to their assessments, which contributed to more effective targeting of our resources.…* *Engagement with Dr Dover’s research enabled me to reach across my international counterparts to make the case for an international analyst’s programme, which led to important discussions and agreements about de\-minimis standards for intelligence analysts, something that had not been agreed previously. The research was important in confirming the benefits of external expert challenge to officers engaged in government analysis, and provided us with the means to extend this practice to generate better results for the Agency.”* Former Head of Capability, NCA **\[E1\].** 

 Additionally, refinements to mechanisms by which NCA analysts are able to engage with outside sources who are not in possession of security clearance have *“contributed to an uptick number of external sources being consulted”.* This has allowed a greater number of academics to engage with NCA that consequently led to “ *the greater understanding of threat”.* Director of Intelligence NCA **\[E4\].** 

 On the basis of **\[R3\]**, NATO appointed Dover as the inaugural Commander’s Academic Advisor in June 2018. This helped to refine NATO’s “ *understanding of the role academics and academic content can play in our intelligence assessments, to refine the ways they engage with outside experts”*. As the result of Dr Dover’s work, NATO has “ *refined the way we select and engage with external academic experts, and consequently we are confident the contextual element of our assessments are stronger”.* NATO Analysis Division Chief **\[E2\].** 

 The UK Cabinet Office cited their adoption of the recommendations made by Dover in their decision to open an intelligence analysts’ academy **\[R1\]**. Dover’s research informed the “ *initiative to create the UK’s first Intelligence Assessment Academy, which opened in October 2019 in London, and which provides the intelligence community with the sort of common, but advanced level education and training that has been a bedrock of Dr Dover’s research recommendations”.* Professional Head of Intelligence Assessment, Cabinet Office **\[E3\]**. 

 This is the first time that analysts have been systematically trained. Not only did Dover’s research underpin the curriculum, he also played a key part in the Cabinet Office’s recruitment process for the leadership of the Intelligence Academy and he is a member of the Intelligence Academy advisory group **\[E3\].** 

 Internationally, in 2017 Dover and Walsh were commissioned by the Five Eyes Group to design and deliver a professional development programme for 51 intelligence officers. The standard for this training was written by Dover et al and was adopted by the Five Eyes Group in 2018. It has been used by eight intelligence agencies as the platform from which to train their analysts **\[E1\].** Their standard has also been adopted by the NCA, where it has informed the transformation of the training of new officers joining the agency **\[E4\].** 

 Without Dover’s work, sections of the analytical community would still be reliant on older, informal forms of practice and engagement, missing out on the opportunities afforded by engagement with a greater number of external experts. Dover has contributed significantly to the professionalisation of practitioners in this field and built their capacity to engage successfully with external expertise. By doing so, he has contributed to greater understanding on the part of public policy officials and thus to improved national security.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Our research has shaped the understanding and implementation of national and international laws and policies protecting asylum\-seeking and trafficked children and adults. It has ensured the development of Guardianship schemes for all trafficked children in England and Wales, and in addition for unaccompanied minors in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It has also helped to reverse government policy, ensuring that unaccompanied asylum seeking\-children would regain access to legal aid. The research has extended public and professional understanding of Modern Slavery and its impact on trafficked people; it has changed narratives about refugees, highlighting their contributions to their new societies across Europe; and has improved practices for those who work with people who are vulnerable through forced migration. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Every year people engage in *forced migration* when they move from their homelands because of war, poverty or natural disaster. While their reasons for moving extend beyond the definitions of the 1951 Refugee Convention and allied protocol, understanding the experiences of those forced to migrate is vital to supporting them in their new countries. In shaping the meanings of support for forced migrants, our empirical enquiries encompass their needs and vulnerabilities as well as their capabilities within countries of sanctuary. In line with this latter focus, our work adds a distinctive new thread to the empirical literature, using arts\-based methodologies. These contributions define and refine the ways refugees are understood as help seekers and as bridge builders within new societies. Together, these engagements exemplify our approach to refugees as talented creators and curators of their lives. 

 Our underpinning research has focussed on unaccompanied asylum\-seeking children. This work laid a foundation for understanding how they sought \(and sometimes found\) safety, belonging and success in new countries. Our work tracked young asylum seekers’ experiences of keeping silence and secrets, and managing time, transitions and waiting, as well as foster care and food pathways. Cody’s work from 2013, as one example, focussed on the meaning of ‘reintegration’ for unaccompanied \(including trafficked\) children \[ **3.1**\].  Since that time our work has broadened to include adults who are trafficked, as well as forced migrants displaced through natural disasters and poverty. On the basis of our range of work, we were commissioned by the Home Office to evaluate the provision of independent Guardianship for unaccompanied minors and other children subject to trafficking in England and Wales. \[ **3.5**\]. 

 Consolidating this focus, our research has examined other issues facing forced migrants. In 2015, Connolly authored the first of two research reports \(an update was published in 2017\) on separated migrant children’s access to legal aid in partnership with the Children’s Society \[ **3.2**\]. Between 2017 and 2019, Hynes led a four country study on human trafficking across Albania, Viet Nam, Nigeria and the UK in partnership with the International Organization for Migration \(IOM\) and funded by the Modern Slavery Innovation Fund \(MSIF\) \[ **3.3**\]. Funded by the British Academy, Hutchinson worked across several research projects in partnership with *Terre des Hommes* \- *Lausanne* \(Tdh\) on child protection in refugee communities \[ **3.4**\]. This work, examining early marriage as a tactic of survival for young women in the context of forced migration, has built a framework within which risk and protective factors can be understood by practitioners and policy makers in nuanced, context specific ways. It demonstrated the efficacy of a tool used to assess hope and resilience \[the Hope tool\] among migrant children, paving the way for better more targeted support. 

 In 2016, Wroe founded the charity ‘ *Social Work without Borders*’. The charity takes a social justice approach to its work. It provides pro\-bono expert social work reports for people enduring asylum and immigration decisions. In 2019 Wroe’s reference book \[ **3.6**\], linked to the charity’s values and commitments, brought together academics, asylum seekers, practitioners and activists to define and promote social justice based approaches to working with refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in the UK and internationally. 

 The ESRC funded ‘separated child migrants' care relationships and caring practices’ project \[2019\-2023\], on which Kohli is Co\-I, has begun to describe how children care for one another in contexts of forced migration.  In 2020 Kohli as PI received funding from NordForsk for a 4 year project on *Relational Wellbeing in the lives of young* \[adult\] *refugees in Finland, Norway and the UK*. It was one of seven projects funded by NordForsk out of 220 applications by international research teams.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Our work has informed legislative design in all UK countries. It has impacted on social policy to generate supportive and sustainable futures for forced migrants. It has improved professional practices across a range of state and non\-state actors internationally, as shown below. 

 **Impact on UK legislation and social policy** 

 Our work has led to independent Guardianship being established for all trafficked children in England and Wales, and for unaccompanied asylum seeking children in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The role of a Guardian is to provide reliable and trusted long term adult support for a child, and to link and bridge between welfare, immigration and criminal justice services to secure the best interests of that child. A Guardian is, to use a term coined by us in 2013, someone who is *by the child’s side, and on their side*, as they navigate these complex systems. In 2010 we evaluated the first such scheme in Scotland. In 2014 we pioneered the plans for a Guardianship service in Northern Ireland. Our 2015 report \[ **3.5**\] took the next steps in defining Guardianship within the terms of s48 of The Modern Slavery Act 2015. It set the foundations for a new independent service in England and Wales. Via ane Independent Expert Advisory Panel on child trafficking, we advise the Home Office on the rollout of Guardianship in England and Wales. 

 Since 2012, Kohli has acted as an advisor to a number of Select Committees in both Houses of Parliament, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Migration, and the Children’s Commissioner for England. Following our work on Guardianship, in 2018 Kohli was invited to advise and assist parliamentarians in reviewing s48 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and its impact on child trafficking \[ **5.2**\]. This resulted directly, *inter alia*, to the Government dispensing with the title of Independent Child Trafficking *Advocate* \(ICTA\) and replacing it with Independent Child Trafficking *Guardian* \(ICTG\) to reflect the role’s scope beyond advocacy, as indicated by our empirical findings. The parliamentarians that formed the review committee \[Baron Field \(then Frank Field MP\), Baroness Elizabeth Butler\-Sloss, Maria Miller, MP\] noted in February 2019 that:  *We were all hugely impressed by the breadth and quality of the evidence you gathered, as well as the level of personal and professional insight you brought to your commentary and recommendations. We have studied your findings and proposals closely to inform our own recommendations to the Home Office, and I am sure you will be able to recognise your influence clearly reflected in our interim report. Your contribution to the Review on this topic has been invaluable to us.* \[ **5.2**\] Kohli’s underpinning empirical work on silence and secrets in the lives of unaccompanied children was chosen in 2020 by the British Journal of Social Work as among 50 outputs that are *crucial in understanding social work in the past and informing research and practice of the future*. 

 Connolly’s 2015 research \(updated by her in 2017\) on the impact of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 \(LASPO\) on separated migrant children was crucial in enabling their access to legal aid. Before 2012, about 2,500 separated migrant children per year had relied on legal aid to resolve their immigration claims. This stopped as LASPO came into force. Connolly’s research was used to successfully bring separated children back into scope of legal aid in October 2019 \- the only group to be brought back into scope. Through this work, scope now includes children’s citizenships claims in legal aid for the first time, as well as legal aid applications for EU nationals. In a testimonial to Connolly’s work the Children’s Society noted in December 2020 that: *Dr Connolly …ensured our work was of the highest standard but also worked in ways that helped us to maximise impact and retain a tight focus on the needs of unaccompanied children and the needs of our judicial review*… *Dr Connolly’s work with us is one of the best examples of academic impact we have come across* \[ **5.1**\] 

 **International impacts** 

 From 2013 Cody’s research has yielded fresh understandings of the differences between ‘reunification’ \(a line of connection back with family\) to ‘reintegration’ \(a circle of wellness within a community\). This holistic approach led to her output \[ **3.1**\] within her broader work of designing a toolkit for monitoring and evaluating reintegration for separated children. It was subsequently disseminated by the RISE Learning Network \(led by the international NGO Family for Every Child\) across 12 ‘learning partners’ in sub\-Saharan Africa, South Central Asia and Latin America \[ **5.1**\]. The findings from this work were cited extensively by the UN Special Rapporteur in 2015 in her report on care, recovery and reintegration programmes for child victims of sale and sexual exploitation \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Through Hutchinson’s pioneering evaluation of the Hope tool, building on \[ **3.3**\], community\-based child protection programmes have been deployed by Terre des hommes \(Tdh\) to build resilience amongst Palestinian refugees. The training and investment in social workers that the programme pioneered has resulted in the growth of workforce development teams in Tdh across the Middle East and North Africa \(MENA\) region. This can be corroborated through testimonies from Tdh country teams in Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. The results of Hutchinson’s work on child marriage among Syrian Refugees in Jordan and Lebanon was published in 2020 \[ **5.4**\]. Tdh is able to confirm via the sources cited under Hutchinson below, that this research has significantly influenced their programme and policy on child marriage, and informed applications to donors for funding. About 70% of their new framework of action on child marriage in the region is based on our research. 

 Working with the French charity *Apprentis D’Auteuil,* Kohli’s research was used to create innovative social work practices across four European States \(France, Italy, Germany and Greece\) \[ **5.3**\]. These are aimed at protecting and enhancing the everyday wellbeing of unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A key output of this project was the production of online training via subscription to a Digital Notebook for those working directly with these children in Germany, Italy, France and Greece. This was launched in Paris in October 2020. The notebook currently has 1000 practitioner subscribers across Europe, with the aim of securing 3000 by the end of 2021, once the German, Italian and Greek versions of the Digital Notebook are launched. In appraising Kohli’s impact on the project, Apprentis D’Auteuil observed in April 2020: *Today, I can say without a doubt that inviting \[Kohli\] to join our project’s team was certainly one of the most crucial decisions we have made for our project’s success. Our fruitful common collaboration will most certainly have a significant impact on the field social work, when it comes to providing better care to unaccompanied minors in our countries in Europe. We are very grateful for the time and passion Professor Kohli brought to our project, and we hope that this only marks the beginning of our collaboration in the years to come...* 

 Opfermann’s and Evans’ research studies in South Africa and Scotland respectively \(submitted as outputs, not listed here\) using theatre and visual arts, precedes Kohli’s work using visual art methodologies in the NordForsk project. Turning the lives of young refugees into theatre based performance art or visual arts exemplifies our approach to refugees as talented curators of their lives. Moving beyond narratives of refugees as needy, these contributions define and refine ways these young people are understood as builders and creators within their new societies. 

  

 Hynes’ study of trafficked people \[ **3.3**\] resulted in expanded and enhanced networking amongst counter\-trafficking professionals across Viet Nam, Albania, Nigeria and the UK \[ **5.5**\]. The research report by Hynes is currently a key reference in the latest Country of Origin reports used by asylum decision makers at the Home Office \[ **5.5** shows the COI for Albania as an example\]. The study directly informed IOM’s approach and practice around social stigma in Indonesia and Ethiopia. IOM have confirmed the impact of this work across Viet Nam, Albania and Nigeria, particularly in relation to understanding prevention, the provision of services for men, boys and atypical ‘victims’ of human trafficking and mental health needs. In a testimony to the University in December 2020, IOM in Viet Nam wrote: *Dr Hynes's knowledge and expertise in the field of migration and human trafficking and lead on the research led to a successful analysis and research report. It helped IOM Viet Nam successfully secured a UK funded trafficking project entitled Tackling Modern Slavery in Viet Nam \(TMSV\). This research resulted in wide recognition of the issue of trafficking and vulnerability of Vietnamese migrants in the UK, and need to improve the evidence\-base, through further research and evidence to support the operational work of IOM and other agency' s work to counter trafficking in Viet Nam.* In October 2020, this study achieved two A\+ grades within the Home Office’s evaluation of the effectiveness of the Modern Slavery Innovation Fund \[ **5.5**\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A problem\-oriented collaboration between Leeds researchers and Asda was used to “nudge” its customers to reduce their food waste and to buy more sustainable products, contributing to efforts to meet Courtauld Commitment targets on UK food waste. This has reduced food waste by 48,276 tonnes and CO<sub>2</sub>e by 183,449 tonnes, whilst at the same time increasing the pre\-tax profit for the retailer by GBP5,000,000. Furthermore, Asda experienced an increase in brand loyalty as a result of the core consumer\-focused sustainability strategy. The methods and tools developed in the project were promoted as best practice through the grocery, retailing and higher education trade associations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The environmental impact of food consumption is a significant global problem: the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation \(FAO\) suggests that one third of food produced for human consumption is wasted. In the UK, this amounts to 20,000,000 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e per year. The UK grocery sector has used the Courtauld Commitment to deliver voluntary food waste reductions. Leeds researchers, led by Professor Young, partnered with Asda \(14% of UK market share in 2020, according to statista.com\) to achieve Courtauld Commitment targets, gaining access to data on 18,000,000 shoppers per week in the UK. The research adapted established social research methods from the laboratory to a real\-world food retailing setting. The research focused on 1\) how to reduce the food waste of customers through more effective \(positive\) communication, and 2\) how to increase sales of products labelled as sustainable by ensuring that the correct message is communicated to the correct groups. 

 Leeds researchers first applied the social\-influence theory to ‘nudge’ people towards wasting less food, which was the first field test of social\-influence theory. The Waste and Resources Action Programme \(WRAP\) has developed industry\-standard messages on food waste. These messages were communicated to Asda customers over two six\-week periods in 2014 and 2015 via three channels: the in\-store magazine, e\-newsletters, and stickers placed on products. Asda’s Facebook page and in\-store demonstrations allowed customers to interact with the ideas in the messaging, giving them an opportunity discuss them, share their own thoughts and witness practical waste\-reduction practices. Over the next 21 months, six follow\-up surveys were conducted with customers to ask them to self\-report how much food they wasted. The surveys involved between 2,789 and 7,900 people. The results indicated that the combined communication channels and repeated messages decreased the food wasted by customers. The research revealed that social media an intervention tool, did not replicate enough of the effect of ‘face\-to\-face’ interaction that does create change but in\-store demonstrations of how to reduce food waste were successful \[1, 2, 3\]. 

 Next the researchers performed data analytics to a combination of national datasets acquired though the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre and open data to gain insight into the characteristics of those purchasing sustainable products. Datasets were sourced from National Statistics, TransUnion UK \(previously Callcredit\) and Asda’s sales data from 18,000,000 customers a week. The research identified clear differences between purchasing behaviours by mainstream and green consumers of sustainably\-labelled products. For example, while a range of sociodemographic factors can predict purchase patterns of organic milk bought by green consumers, this is not the case for free\-range eggs bought by mainstream consumers. The results demonstrated that mainstream consumers do not respond to green consumer marketing methods adopted by retailers, and a change in their marketing strategy was needed for sustainable products to become mainstream \[4\]. 

 The ongoing collaboration with Asda began in 2013. The research was supported by funding from Innovate UK, Asda and ESRC for a 3\-year Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) and the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Asda is one of the largest supermarket chains in the UK. Between 2015 and 2018, it held a 15% market share in the groceries market. More than 18,000,000 people shop in Asda stores weekly and consumer spending at Asda has been estimated at over GBP4,000,000,000 per quarter between 2015 and 2017 \(statista.com\). The Asda Chief Customer Officer said: *“As a major food retailer, we have a responsibility and the ability to bring about large scale change when it comes to tackling food waste. By partnering with the University of Leeds, the team has been able to take our insight and really explore this area, meaning that we now have a greater understanding of customer attitude and behaviour, helping shape the way we communicate with our customers and ultimately the way we do business”* \[A\]. 

 Asda estimated that 2,000,000 customers made changes in their homes as a result of the campaign co\-produced with Leeds researchers, and 81% of them said that they planned to follow the advice in the interventions \[A, B\]. Examples included using shopping lists to shop smarter, planning meals and using up food that would otherwise be thrown away. As a result of the interventions, customers saved on average GBP57 per annum in 2015, rising to GBP81 per annum for those who said they had seen the interventions in both 2014 and 2015, by applying these changes in their home \[2, 3\]. This is estimated to reduce food waste by 48,276 t \(0.7% of UK annual\) and 183,449 t of CO<sub>2</sub>e \(using Waste and Resources Action Programme \(WRAP\) conversions GBP1 = 0.15 kg food waste; 1 t food waste = 3.80 t CO<sub>2</sub>e\). A Senior Director at Asda reported that *“the customer\-reported results showed a positive change in behaviour and true cost savings.”* \[B\]. 

 Secondly, the research was designed to directly inform and improve Asda’s sales strategy and profits. Through the customer food waste campaign, Asda was able to build customer brand loyalty adding GBP5,000,000 to pre\-tax profits \[B\]. The research team modelled Asda’s sales data through the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre, focusing on mainstream and niche green product lines such as eggs, milk, poultry, cleaning products/hygiene and organic vegetables. The analysis identified more sustainable products that could triple sales in particular postcodes by communicating the correct message to the correct groups \[4\]. 

 Thirdly, the sustainability strategy at Asda was directly informed by the research. *“The project influenced the activities of the sustainable business team, the insight team, the community team, the public affairs team and the trading team within Asda...The customer voice has now been embedded into every aspect of the sustainability strategy”* \[B\]. The Leeds researchers conducted quarterly surveys of 20,000 customers on sustainability issues from 2013 to 2016, which was used to feed into policy direction and Asda’s new Sustainability Strategy 2.0. Progress against the new strategy was publicly reported in “The Big Green Journey” report in 2016 \[C\]. The Leeds researchers directly contributed to annual consumer sustainability reports to help Asda adhere to the cross\-food sector targets in the Courtauld Commitment and to report progress to customers \[D\]. 

 Asda shared the outcomes of the project with over 1,000 suppliers through their Sustain and Save exchange forum and invested GBP20,000 in holding a conference to present the learnings of the project with staff and suppliers \[B\]. The work drew the attention of Walmart, Asda’s international parent company, and featured in the 2017 Global Responsibility Report as an example of best practice, which is shared globally across all Walmart companies \[E\]. 

 The research has also had a wider influence on practice and policy in the retailing sector beyond Asda. This research and interventions it informed were focused on customers, which was unique as the other major retailers focused on their supply chains. The work from the partnership led to three sector\-wide accolades: \(1\) a short\-listing in the Institute of Grocery Distribution \(IGD\) Award for Sustainable Futures \[F\]; \(2\) the Environmental Association for Universities and Colleges \(EAUC\) Highly Commended Green Gown Award for Research and Development \[G\]; and \(3\) the KTP Excellence Award, which was awarded the highest grade of ""Outstanding"" \[H\]. 

 The grocery and wider retail sector benefited from the outcomes of the partnership showcased by WRAP in the Courtauld Commitment 3 \[I\] and the British Retail Consortium \[J\]. The impact of the work was also recognised at a Parliamentary Reception by the Director of WRAP, the Chief Customer Officer at Asda, the CEO of Innovate UK, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Rural Affairs and Biosecurity at Defra, and the Member of Parliament for Leeds Central. At the event, the Director of WRAP said **:** *“Food waste is one of the biggest challenges of our time, it’s bad for the environment, economy and to society as a whole. WRAP has a track record of reducing waste and at the heart of this work is collective action, which is pivotal to this success. We therefore welcome Asda’s work with the University of Leeds to help customers waste less and save money, and encourage more of this type of work to ensure food waste reduction continues.”  \[A\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Wilberforce Institute critically investigates the history of transatlantic slavery to inform and to drive responses to modern slavery. In 2015 the Institute was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for its impact on society regarding: i\) the quantification of slavery, and ii\) anti\-slavery opinion\-building. This award acknowledged the prominent role the Institute played in shaping the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The Institute’s contribution to the development of the Global Slavery Index and Multiple Systems Estimation \(MSE\) tool led to a radical reassessment by the UK Government of the number of people enslaved in the UK. The Institute’s interactive anti\-slavery opinion\-building tools have driven modern slavery prevention campaigns in schools across the UK, and in West Africa.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The legacy of William Wilberforce is reflected in the University of Hull’s continued fight against all forms of modern slavery and exploitation. The Hull native William Wilberforce used his position as MP to lead the British campaign to abolish the slave trade. **Following a £3 million strategic investment by the University, The Wilberforce Institute was founded in 2005 and its inaugural patron was Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It is the oldest research institute of its kind in the United Kingdom.** The Institute is one of the leading international research centres in the world working on slavery\-related issues. Its unique blend of historical and contemporary perspectives enables the Institute to add depth and nuance to tackling the challenges of the present, particularly when it comes to the structure and organisation of modern slavery and the formulation of strategies to bring it to an end. **Working with other leading historical and modern slavery research centres across the world, the Institute’s activities are supported by a portfolio of collaborative external research grants worth approximately £15.5 million.** 

 The following key research findings \(KRFs\) underpin the impact: 

1.  **KRF1**: <ins> **The extent of Global Slavery has been significantly underestimated**</ins> 

 **The underpinning research represents historical \(Professor Richardson\) and social science \(Professor Bales\) methodological innovation, which provides new accessible insights into the quantifiable numbers of people forced into slavery both in the past and in the present.** 

 The launch of a multi\-source online database of 35,000 transatlantic slave voyages \( [www.slavevoyages.org](http://www.slavevoyages.org/)\) was the culmination of a collaborative international project. The database became the basis of several publications including an *Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade* \(2010\) **\(3a\)**.  Harvard Professor and Macarthur Fellow, Henry Louis Gates, has described the Atlas as ‘the Rosetta Stone of slave historiography’. In contemporary research, Professor Bales has led governmental and criminal justice understanding and awareness of the extent of modern slavery, creating the impetus for campaigns to prevent exploitation and trafficking **\(3b\)**. His contribution to developing **new methodological tools for measuring the extent of modern slavery across the globe has also been ground\-breaking in uncovering the hidden levels of modern slavery** \( **3c\).** His research was recognised with the $100,000 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Promoting World Order in 2011 and his development of the Global Slavery Index has been publicly acknowledged by Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Julia Gillard. 

 **KRF2**: <ins> **There is an urgent need to historicize the growing body of work on modern slavery**</ins> 

 **This key insight builds on Professor Oldfield’s research on anti\-slavery opinion building during the nineteenth century and its relevance to understanding the dynamics of modern social movements, including the modern anti\-slavery movement**. 

 Professor Oldfield’s research has been instrumental in **developing the concept of an anti\-slavery ‘usable past’** that demonstrates a continuous link between the past and the present, through what can be described as an active ‘protest memory’ **\(3d & 3e\)**. From these ideas, Oldfield developed ‘ *Stolen Lives’* \(AHRC,  [www.stolenlives.co.uk](http://www.stolenlives.co.uk/)\) *and ‘The Antislavery Usable Past’* \(AHRC *\),* working collaboratively with Professor Bales whose research at the Wilberforce Institute played a vital role in raising awareness about modern slavery from schools through to governments and international NGOs **\(3b & 3f**\). Together, the interdisciplinary team developed new methods of presenting and disseminating information by juxtaposing the experiences of enslaved people from the eighteenth to twenty\-first centuries in an easy to access format. 

 The success of these two projects provided the springboard for further collaborative bids that explored the role of slavery and colonialism in contemporary society \(Horizon 2020 European Colonial Heritage\), and in 2019 this combined body of research culminated in the Wilberforce Institute being included in the £10 million Prime Minister’s Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre funded by UKRI/AHRC.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact strategy of the Wilberforce Institute is to raise public awareness of historical and modern slavery to influence **public policy and education**. In achieving this, the Institute has prioritised two distinct areas of activity that flow directly from its key research findings: 

1.  <ins> **The Quantification of Slavery**</ins> **\(KRF1\)** 

 <ins>Pathways to Impact:</ins> **The Institute’s role in developing the metrics for the Global Slavery Index \(GSI\) provided the first comprehensive and accessible measure of the extent of modern slavery in 167 countries around the world.** Aimed at informing practitioners and policymakers, the GSI has been disseminated around the world. The 2014 GSI prompted a response from 38 governments and generated more than 700 news articles and broadcasts in all regions of the globe. 

 <ins>Impact:</ins> As a member of the Walk Free Expert Advisory Group **\(EVID 1\)**, Professor Bales spearheaded the design, development and dissemination of the GSI which provides the key international measure of the extent and response to modern slavery **\(EVID 2\). The GSI is used by governments, researchers, NGOs and charities around the world to support the liberation of slaves and their reintegration into society.** As the lead author of the 2014 GSI, Professor Bales’s research led the Walk Free Foundation to co\-found the London\-based Freedom Fund – a multi\-million\-pound NGO whose sole work is slavery eradication. Professor Bales became a Director of the Freedom Fund which has gone on to impact 765,628 lives and liberate 28,040 people **\(EVID 3\)**. 

 As the driving force behind uncovering the hidden extent of modern slavery, Professor Bales has been at the forefront of the global campaign to raise awareness of the suffering of exploitation of 35.8 million people across the globe \(GSI 2014, **EVID 2**\). **As the world’s only country\-by\-country estimate of people living in slavery, the GSI maps the prevalence, vulnerability and governmental response to global slavery and has raised the visibility of the victims of modern slavery across the globe.** Kevin Hyland, the first UK Independent Modern Slavery Commissioner, confirms the international reach of this research: *“Kevin Bales led development of the Global Slavery Index \(GSI\) in collaboration with UN and Australian actors, providing estimates of rates of slavery in 167 countries across the world which was used to encourage Australia to introduce their own Modern Slavery Act in 2018.”* **\(EVID 4\).** 

 Building on the successful launch of the GSI, Professor Bales developed a new collaboration with the Chief Scientific Officer at the Home Office to co\-produce the methodological innovation called Multiple Systems Estimation \(MSE\) **\(EVID 5\). This resulted in a radical reassessment by the UK Government of the number of people enslaved in Britain, revising the figure upwards to between 10,000 and 13,000 men, women and children: roughly four times the figure produced by the National Crime Agency’s Human Trafficking Centre in 2013.** Taken together, the GSI and MSE changed our understanding of the prevalence of Modern Slavery in the UK and provided the impetus for a new British Government Modern Slavery Strategy and Bill. Launched by the then Home Secretary, Theresa May in 2014, the Modern Slavey Bill had the full, written endorsement of Professors Bales and Silverman **\(EVID 6\) and came into law as the Modern Slavery Act in 2015.**  The Act provides the first comprehensive powers to the Courts specifically designed for combatting modern slavery, and created the position of the UK Independent Anti\-Slavery Commissioner.  According to the 2020 UK Annual Report on Modern Slavery, there have been 1257 convictions since the Act was introduced, delivering justice to many more thousands of victims. 

 Launching the UK Government’s Modern Slavery Strategy \(and Modern Slavery Bill\) in November 2014, Theresa May commented on the revised estimates provided by Bales and Silverman: *“The first step to eradicating the scourge of modern slavery is acknowledging and confronting its existence. The estimated scale of the problem in modern Britain is shocking and these new figures starkly reinforce the case for urgent action.”* **\(EVID 6\)**. The role of Professor Bales’s research in shaping the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act \(2015\) is further reinforced by Kevin Hyland,  who commended the impact of Bales’ work on the quantification of modern slavery: *“\[It\]* *resulted in a dramatic reassessment of the scale of modern slavery in the UK and the figures established via the MSE continue to be widely quoted within official documents relating to modern slavery in the UK – not least in the Government’s Modern Slavery Strategy 2014 which set out its approach to tackling the issue and later paved the way for the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015*.” **\(EVID 4\).** 

 In recognition of his contribution to developing the Multiple Systems Estimation \(MSE\) tool whilst working at the Wilberforce Institute **,** Professor Bales was awarded the 2018 ESRC Prize for Outstanding International Impact for ** **“helping to provide the first reliable estimates of modern slavery. National and global slavery estimates, including Walk Free's Global Slavery Index on which Professor Bales collaborates, are the baseline against which the United Nations can measure progress towards its Sustainable Development Goal of ending slavery by 2030”.** 

 <ins> **Anti\-Slavery Opinion Building</ins> \(KRF2\)** 

 <ins>Pathways to Impact</ins>: The Institute has designed and delivered public campaigns to raise awareness of historical and modern slavery, using music, film, teaching aids, exhibitions and web resources. Between 2015 and 2021 the *Stolen Lives* website had 34,000 pageviews and 8,185 views of the Repairing Broken Lives video resources. Alongside *Stolen Lives* \(2015\), the *Antislavery Usable Past* project \(2019\), the \#HiddenInPlainSight campaign \(launched in November 2016, which placed ‘human packaging’ at high\-footfall locations\), and the \#BreakTheChain campaign \(launched in London in 2018, using a ‘human vending machine’\) all drew attention to the 25 million people trapped in forced labour around the world. 

 <ins>Impact</ins>: **The opinion\-building initiatives developed by the Wilberforce Institute have been adopted by many key stakeholders and have directly informed national public broadcasting campaigns designed to bring modern slavery to the attention of the British people. This included TV adverts, and **The Telegraph** and **Daily Mail** print and digital advertising** **\(EVID 7\).** As Kevin Hyland, the first UK Independent Modern Slavery Commissioner confirms, the strap line of the Hull University campaign ‘hidden in plain sight’ has inspired subsequent anti\-slavery campaigns, helping to highlight the role that the public can play in identifying potential victims of exploitation: *“Following the ‘Hidden in Plain Sight’ campaign, the phrase was then incorporated into a national media campaign on modern slavery and continues to be used in the bulk of public literature. I have personally participated in hundreds of events where the term is used including a BBC Radio Four interview following this campaign by the Wilberforce Institute to discuss some of its findings and the role the public can play in helping to identify potential victims”.* **\(EVID 4\)**. 

 Similarly, **‘Stolen Lives’, led by Professor Oldfield has raised awareness of slavery at over 60 different public events and its educational materials have been used in schools across the UK.** The Acting General Secretary of the NASUWT comments on the tangible benefits the Stolen Lives campaign has had for teachers and students: *“NASUWT commends the work of the Institute on the Stolen Lives project and felt it such an important issue that they provided a stand for Stolen Lives at the NASUWT Annual Conference in 2016, hosted two workshops at the NASUWT Women Teachers’ Consultation Conference and two workshops at their BME Teachers’ Consultation Conference, collectively reaching almost 800 NASUWT members. The NASUWT also committed £6000 to the project, specifically to ensure that the NASUWT website was kept updated with the Stolen Lives work and that all 300,000 of our members had free access to the project’s resources on account of how indispensable they are for teachers working on this difficult, yet immensely important topic.”* \( **EVID 8\).** 

 **Stolen Lives** has also had international impact, most notably in Sierra Leone where it proved the inspiration for an exhibition on modern slavery at the National Museum of Sierra Leone \(2017\),** the first of its kind. Subsequently, the British Council in Sierra Leone, working in collaboration with the Wilberforce Institute, arranged for the translation of songs from *Stolen Lives* into local languages and used them as resources in its *Connecting Classrooms* programme. To date this has reached over 30,000 students and helped to raise awareness of modern slavery in Sierra Leone, West Africa.  As the former Country Director and Project Lead of the British Council in Sierra Leone readily attests: *“The British Council in Sierra Leone used Stolen Lives as part of a school programme designed to initiate discussions about modern slavery through performance, debate, film and the visual arts. This programme, which I project led, called ‘Open Your Eyes” \(referencing one of the specially written songs for Stolen Lives\) directly involved 2000 students from ages 12 to 16 but indirectly reached some 30,000 in the wider school community and far more through media outlets.* *This work was integral in increasing knowledge, awareness and understanding around the topics of modern slavery and human trafficking amongst the students and their teachers and not least the wider school community \(parents, the police, church and mosque leaders\); equally, it was crucial in assisting prevention efforts by arming children with a better education of the risks facing them.”* **\(EVID 9\).** 

 **Finally, and importantly, the work of the Wilberforce Institute is also shared with the local schools and communities in the Humber region.** Performances from *Stolen Lives* have been held locally at Hull's Freedom Festival which attracts audiences of over 130,000. Whilst the Wilberforce Institute has worked closely with the Freedom Festival over many years, the Artistic Director and Joint Chief Executive of Freedom Festival singles out the *Stolen Lives* programme at the 2015 Festival for special mention: *“We were delighted to include Stolen Lives in our 2015 programme. The two live performances, involving three local schools, had a significant impact, not just in terms of underlining and articulating the serious message behind the Freedom Festival, but also in bringing to the public a real insight into the fact that slavery continues to occur today, even in our own communities.”* **\(EVID 10\).** 

 **In 2015 the Wilberforce Institute was awarded the Queens Anniversary Prize** for Further and Higher Education because it had *“won global recognition for its applied research into slavery in all its forms and for bringing the lessons of the past, through its ground\-breaking Global Slavery Index, to the combating of modern slavery”* **\(EVID 11\).**

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **1\) Improvements to design standards against tsunamis** 

  

 Figure 1. Displacement of artificial armour units after 2011 Tsunami 



Coastal defence structures in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tanzania and Japan, designed using the Hudson formula suffered extensive damage by the 2004 Indian Ocean and the 2011 Great East Japan tsunamis. Dr Jayaratne conducted post\-disaster field surveys in partnership with three Japanese universities \(Waseda University, Yokohama National University and the University of Tokyo\) and found that the damaged structures had provided insufficient protection. A modified Hudson breakwater design formula for differed tsunamis was developed \(R1\) and was incorporated into new ASCE/SEI 7 design standards. 

 Concrete coastal defence walls require reinforcement to provide energy absorption against the seismic and impact loads generated by tsunamis, making them difficult to construct. Dr Abbas and the team developed a numerical model to examine the replacement of conventional bars with steel fibres under cyclic/seismic loads **\(R2\)**, improving the design of earthquake and impact\-resistant concrete structures. 

  

 **2\) Coastal erosion** 

  

 In collaboration with the Sri Lankan Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department \(CC&CRMD\) and Japanese and Sri Lankan academics, Dr Jayaratne investigated coastal erosion problems in Marawila, one of the most vulnerable coastlines in Sri Lanka. Four decades of data were analysed; field investigations were undertaken \( **R3**\); numerical modelling of wave propagation was conducted \( **R4**\). They recommended sustainable coastal erosion mitigation measures to CC&CRMD and Lanka Hydraulics Institute \(LHI\). 

  

 **3\) Preparedness of local communities and risk reduction against tsunamis** 

  

 After the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, Dr Jayaratne and colleagues conducted a field survey of structures, coastlines and communities and developed a novel 2D numerical simulation model of tsunami events \( **R5**\). The model identified locations vulnerable to extreme inundation in Legundi island and South Lampung, Indonesia. 

  

 Dr Jayaratne, with colleagues from UCL and Kansai University, researched the differing perceptions between Disaster Risk Reduction \(DRR\) experts and laypersons on natural disasters, and implications of perception gaps for the realisation of ‘community\-based’ and ‘participatory’ DRR. He visited disaster\-prone communities in the UK \(Sturmer, Slapton\) and Japan \(Inami, Hita\), to conduct interviews and inspect field locations. From this investigation, a novel disaster category\-scale was developed. **\(R6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1\) Preparedness of Local Communities and Risk Reduction against Tsunamis** 

  

 In 2018, the collapse of Anak Krakatau island into the sea caused an enormous tsunami to wash over vulnerable coastal areas in Banten, Java and Lampung, Sumatra. The toll of this disaster was 426 people dead; 14,059 people injured; 25 people missing presumed dead; 2,752 houses destroyed and 510 boats damaged beyond repair. 

  

 


 Figure 2 and 3. Devastation after tsunami in Lampung 

Focus group meetings and seminars with stakeholders were conducted in Lampung, Sumatra. Over 1000 online participants were invited. These seminars serve to strengthen community resilience and reduce anxieties pertaining to future mega tsunamis in the area \( **S1**\). 

  

 The provincial council letter of Lampung states: 

  

 *“The education workshop of 50 stakeholders has increased community engagement and contributed to building local capacity to reduce the environmental risk from tsunamis... The research will provide valuable input to the planning of evacuation routes and organisation of mock tsunami drills; these efforts are considered to be vital for the protection of the population of approximately 8,500 people residing in the coastal town of Kalianda”* \( **S2**\). 

  

 Discussions and seminars held with 40 local council DRR teams and community leaders made our research widely accessible to the DRR community in the UK, Japan and beyond. The Inami Town Council testimonial letter states: 

  

 *“We learned new and effective disaster management practices… to reduce the environmental risk from these natural hazards. Furthermore, as a government organisation in Japan and responsible for population of 8,000, we can adopt the methodological approach based on the DRR advice to make strategic decisions and re\-shape policy documents of the council”* \( **S3**\). 

  

 **2\) Progressing tsunami protect design** 

  

 Dr Jayaratne has developed a new version of the universal breakwater design formula for different structure types and tsunami levels. 

  

 The formula was presented to LHI, the Institution of Engineers, CC&CRMD, and the Kanagawa Prefectural Government of Japan providing consultation advice for the development of fishery ports  and coastal protection schemes in Sri Lanka \( **S4**\) and estimating tsunami flood defence levels in Kanagawa. 

  

 This new design method plays a key role in strengthening the long\-term viability of new coastal defence structures and resilience of coastal communities in Sri Lanka, Japan and beyond. 

  

 Dr Abbas developed a novel analytical and experimental research programme to examine modern construction materials, such as steel fibre, reducing the economic and environmental repercussions of structural concrete. The work on steel\-fibre\-reinforced concrete led to design recommendations for structures under cyclic/seismic and impact loading, such as coastal defences subject to tsunami waves. Fibres are added to the concrete mix, thus reducing construction time and cost. This has been successfully applied in housing complexes in Malaysia \( **S5**\). 

  

 **3\) Coastal erosion** 

  

 Coastal erosion is a major problem in Sri Lanka. CC&CRMD’s 2018 Coastal Zone Management Plan found that 40% of Sri Lanka’s GDP comes from the assets and businesses around the 1,700 km of coastline at risk. The project “Marawila beach” has an economic value for the country, contributing to reduced environmental risk and improved quality of life for 220 fishing communities and business confidence for 6 hotels and 5 leisure centres in the area. Analysis of wave and sediment data collected over 39\-years have revealed the current status and mechanisms of coastal erosion in Marawila, while new coastal management interventions and numerical models have led to changes and benefits to CC&CRMD’s national agenda. 

  

 The CC&CRMD testimonial letter states: 

  

 *“We felt that Dr Jayaratne and his team’s project focused on Marawila beach is a valuable piece of study, worth of Rs. 5 million \(Sri Lankan rupees\)”* \( **S6**\). 

  

 Following educational meetings, the awareness, attitudes and understanding of the fishing industry and local residents was surveyed, and their ability to make informed decisions on using sustainable coastal resources has been strengthened \( **S7a, S7b**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 There is a concerning trend of loneliness, isolation and an increased risk of suicide among older gay men and lesbians. Older minority sexual groups have been overlooked within ageing research and are grossly under\-represented in mainstream policy and practice. This is particularly problematic in health and social care provision, which provides essential services as people age. 

 The work of Dr Kip Jones, Professor Lee\-Ann Fenge, Dr Rosie Read and Dr Marilyn Cash 

 sought to transform frontline services for this under\-represented group. Their work has increased awareness and encouraged inclusivity, therefore enabling better equipped service provision for older minority sexual groups. This contributes to an improved overall quality of life for LGBT individuals. The work has made a significant contribution towards an inclusive and prejudice\-free society. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **‘The Gay and Grey’ Project \(2003\-2006\)**, funded by The National Lottery Community Fund \(GBP175,000 in total, GBP17,803 awarded to Bournemouth University \(BU\)\), unveiled common themes of participants experiencing issues with personal identity, isolation and exclusion, and highlighted that accessible public services could help \[R1\]. 

 Two issues were left unresolved: a lack of participation from rural residents and limited biographic understanding of participants’ lives. 

 **‘The Gay and Pleasant Land’ project \(2008\-2012\)** funded by Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) \(GBP1,066,468 in total, GBP40,187 awarded to BU\), aimed to bridge these gaps. It was part of the national ‘New Dynamics of Ageing’ programme, funded by five UK research councils. BU’s Dr Kip Jones led the project, supported by BU’s Professor Fenge, Dr Read and Dr Cash. 

 This team set out to understand how older gay men and lesbians in rural areas interacted with their local communities. They considered socio\-economic and cultural effects and differing attitudes towards sexuality and ageing. 

 An advisory committee of older gay people and service providers informed the research direction and helped identify sample participants. 

 The methodology \[R2\], \[R3\] included participatory research methods: Biographic narrative interpretive method, a visual ethnographic method, and an overarching participatory methodology. 

 The findings showed \[R4\]: 

-  There is a lifelong impact on gay men who grew up whilst homosexuality was illegal \(up to 1967\). 

-  Gay men and lesbians face challenges feeling accepted, due to prejudice prevalent in rural communities. They exercised extreme caution about when they ‘came out’ and to whom, if at all. 

-  Participants reported difficulties negotiating with service providers. 

-  Fear and loneliness punctuate the lives of some older gay citizens. They recounted homophobia and heterosexism, which is prejudice by assumption that heterosexuality is the normal sexual orientation. 

-  The risk of suicide was prevalent among older gay men. 

 These biographic insights formed the basis for characters created by Dr Kip Jones for a professionally made and internationally acclaimed short film called RUFUS STONE \[R5, R6\]. The film, written and executively produced by Dr Jones, was Directed by Josh Appignanesi and produced by Cecilia Frugiuele at Parkville Pictures in London. This innovative arts\-based research project uses film to tell the heart\-wrenching tale of two young boys whose growing feelings for each other spark anger and rejection within their 1950s rural community. In a dual timeline narrative, we see the same boys reunited fifty years later. One character has never revealed his sexuality and tragically commits suicide when he thinks his secret is out. 

 Alongside this, Professor Fenge used participatory methods to work with a group of older LGBT people to produce a ‘Methods to Diversity’ card deck \(funded by Big Lottery GBP7,777\) for care agencies and service providers. The colourful playing cards have exercises and activities which prompt staff towards inclusive practice and to consider the diversity of the ageing population. 

 R7 describes how the film and Method Deck were shared with service providers, enabling opportunities to learn and critically reflect upon an informed practice.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

####  Changing attitudes 

 As screenings of the film took place around the world in community cinemas, universities and festivals, the film’s popularity snowballed. It attracted attention both for its brilliance as a film and the tragic lesson it teaches. It featured in a *New York Times* article from 2011, which continued to drive new audiences to the film throughout the impact period. 

 International accolades include the Youth Jury Award for best LGBT film at Rhode Island International Film Festival 2013 \[E1\] and the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) 2015 Research in Film Anniversary Prize shortlist \[E2\]. 

 RUFUS STONE delivered on its aim of prompting discussion around sexuality and marginalisation, whilst ultimately changing attitudes, as demonstrated by its effects in teaching.  In June 2019 student\-teachers from post\-Soviet Kazakhstan were shocked, then transfixed by the struggles the characters faced. A student at Nazarbayev University said: “I \(will\) show this film in my own class. Youth should understand and realise that some existing values are remnants of the older generation and upholding these values will not bring harmony because the world is changing.” \[E3\]. 

 The film was shared online in 2016 and by December 2020 had been viewed over 17,800 times across 73 countries \[E4\]. 

####  Educating future generations 

 RUFUS STONE is used in teaching at several universities throughout the world. A 2019 screening and question and answer session at the University of Manchester led to its inclusion in an undergraduate sociology module, equipping future generations to tackle this societal concern head on \[E5a\]. A lecturer at Brighton University describes the film as “inspirational and impactful for students” and a “landmark/foundation stone” in the field of arts\-based research. \[E5b\] 

 In 2016 it was added to the syllabus at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Istanbul Yeni Yuzyil University and School of Communication and Media Studies in Lisbon, Portugal, where an Assistant Professor found it an excellent example for inspiring personal creativity \[E6\]. 

####  Transforming frontline care 

 The film undoubtedly changed attitudes across a wide audience. Combined with the Method Deck, the two resources targeted a specific group of users who provide care for older people from minority sexual groups. 

-  **Hampshire County Council** have used the film and Method Deck since 2014 in training sessions with Adult Services staff: Police, fire service, residential care staff, operational managers and more \[E7a\]. The Equality and Inclusion Manager in Adults’ Health and Care at the time says: “The film and method deck are powerful tools which have effected changes in attitudes and awareness amongst council staff”. Some colleagues identified with the film from black and ethnic perspectives, showing its universal message of inclusivity. In 2018 the council conducted a staff inclusion and diversity survey and had over 5,000 employees respond. The results indicated that “the County Council has a supportive and inclusive culture” \[E7b\]. The Equality and Inclusion Manager believes that the training using the film and method deck “paved the way to an improvement in attitudes towards inclusion and diversity more generally amongst council staff.” The Hampshire team also say RUFUS STONE and the Method Deck indirectly inspired the county’s first Gay Pride. 

-  For many years, charity **Help and Care UK** provided ‘wayfinder’ staff for the Partnerships for Older People Programme \(POPP\). Wayfinders signposted older people to information and services. They watched RUFUS STONE in 2014 and it challenged attitudes and perceptions. There were some difficult conversations with members of the POPP board who said they held ‘traditional values’ around homosexuality. The Method Deck was used in individual meetings and a greater awareness was reached \[E8\]. In fact, a 2016 wayfinders briefing document includes ‘freedom from discrimination’ on grounds of sexuality as an area wayfinders support \[E9\]. POPP has since been replaced with an updated programme. 

 **The Alzheimer’s Society** has used the film since August 2013 to improve local and regional teams’ understanding of LGBT issues. This led to a more accessible and empathic service, confirmed by the Organisational Development Manager at the time: “There is no question that RUFUS STONE was a catalyst for change. It was a very different approach to the issues, raw and real so made us think outside the box” \[E10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 With the advent of social media the British Military faced a communication environment that they could not ultimately control, and which presented them with significant risks as well as opportunities. Maltby and her team worked empirically to capture and analyse the broad landscape of social media use in the military. The research successfully bridged the gap between older policy makers \(suspicious of social media\) and personnel for whom social media was an everyday reality. Their findings and recommendations were largely adopted by the British Army in their guidelines for social media use. The research was also used to advise the Joint Insight Forum in relation to recruitment and online behaviour, and has had a wide impact on changing perceptions around social media within the military.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Sarah Maltby is an internationally acknowledged media studies expert working in the field of media management research in relation to military institutions and conflict studies \[R1\]. She has been working empirically and analytically in this area since 2001, focusing on issues of media strategy, risk management, psychological and behavioural concerns \[R2, R3\]. Digital media increasingly offers opportunities for the British Armed Forces in strategic and operational contexts \[R1, R2\], and as a public relations tool. Simultaneously, however, with the growing use of social media among 200,000 armed forces personnel \[R4\] there are clear tensions between their social media use and the centralised requirements for control, security, and robust reputational management. These tensions are compounded by the lack of social media expertise among senior management that has generated risk aversion strategies that prohibit proactive and effective management of digital media \[R3\]. As Clare Parker, former Head of Insight and Evaluation at the Directorate of Defence and Communications in the Ministry of Defence stated, “older people who tend to be in command say \[…\] ‘don’t use social media’” \[S2\]. 

 In 2014 Maltby \(PI\) designed and ran the “D.U.N. Project: Defence, Uncertainty and ‘Now Media’: Mapping Social Media in Strategic Communications” funded by Defence, Science and Technology Labs and the ESRC with Co\-I Helen Thornham \(Leeds\) and Daniel Bennett \(post\-doctoral Research Fellow\). The objective of the D.U.N. Project was to interrogate how social media was perceived, managed and responded to differently at a strategic \(MoD\), Institutional \(Army, Navy, Airforce\) and individual level \(Armed Forces Personnel\) using the combined methods of qualitative interviews, focus groups and textual analysis. The research was extensive and ranged across collecting weekly data from online military forums to intensive discussions with personnel and their partners. All three researchers \(Maltby, Thornham, Bennett\) were involved in all aspects of the research but were directed by Maltby, who took the lead in the analysis of the data, and in presenting the findings to the military. The aim was to identify the conceptualisation and reality of risks and opportunities presented by social media across constituent levels and how this could be better managed. 

 The project findings indicated that: 

-  Understandings of use of social media were relatively narrow in military command, undermining effective management of social media risk and opportunity, particularly with regard to the training of Armed Forces personnel and their families \[R3, R4, R5\]. 

-  Dominant cultures of risk aversion in the Defence community cause personnel to misapprehend the institutional risks of social media despite the centrality of social media to their everyday lives, leading to clandestine behaviours \[R4\]. 

-  Informal, public facing communications within the social media space, particularly pseudonymous spaces, were significantly undermining of the Armed Forces’ reputation particularly with regard to issues of gender equality that feed into issues of recruitment and retention \[R6\]. 

-  The tendency to see social media predominantly in terms of risk significantly undermines opportunities to develop digital knowledge, expertise, and management within the wider Armed Forces community, particularly around issues of training, recruitment and retention \[R3\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Impacting on Social Media Policy** 

 In 2018 the British Army published a new set of guidelines for Army personnel: *\#DigitalArmy: Using Social Media in the British Army* \[S8\]. The guidance adopts the central recommendations of Maltby’s research: to recognise social media as a fact of everyday life and not something that can be prohibited; to recognise the opportunity for social media to offer positive representations of army life; but also to give clear guidance about what constitutes unacceptable behaviour \(from security breaches to inter\-personal bullying and sexual harassment\). *\#DigitalArmy* uses the language of Maltby’s research, introducing ideas of reputational management and risk \(p. 2\) and arguing that there is no absolute anonymity online \(‘pseudonymity’\). Referring to the work of Maltby and her team, the document states: “Research shows that some of our best received communications are created by more junior ranks using digital channels in an authentic manner. The Army is keen to support them” \[S8 p. 2\]. This represents a decisive shift in policy that acknowledges not simply the reality of social media, but that younger recruits might be the ones most able to contribute to the reputational growth of the Army. 

 For an institution that is inevitably hierarchical, the dramatic shift underpinning the new policy was generational: thus Lt. Col. \[text removed for publication\] admits that “the issue we have is we tend to have older people like myself making policy decisions and we need to be able to encompass what young people think in order to make those policies as effective as possible” \[S6\]. It was this younger perspective that informed *\#DigitalArmy* and was a direct consequence of Maltby’s research: “when I was reviewing the Army’s new social media policy \[…\] I did so with Sarah’s work at the forefront of my mind” \[S6\]. 

 Maltby’s work emphasised what is at stake around social media and the military: as Blanca Grey, Directorate of Defence Communications, put it, “Maltby really gave us an initial idea of how people perceive the armed forces as not being very inclusive” \[S7\], and this was predominantly due to online material. The research recommendation to encourage ‘healthy’ social media and to have a policy of responsibility and openness around social media practice “which was taken on board by senior MOD personnel at the time” \[S7\] is fundamentally embedded in the guidelines and was adopted as part of a policy on retention and inclusivity. *\#DigitalArmy* guidelines are distributed to all Army service personnel \(approximately 79,000 regular full\-time personnel and 27,000 reserve part\-time personnel\) and incorporated into annual refresher and pre\-deployment training sessions marking a significant footprint for this research \[S8\]. 

 **Changing Perceptions of Social Media in the Armed Forces** 

 The findings from the research were shared at a series of workshops with the Heads of Digital Communications for each of the military services and senior personnel at the Joint Services Command and Staff College \(JSCSC\). Later Maltby was invited to join the Joint Insight Forum \- a newly formed MOD committee of insight and evaluation representatives working across Defence. Maltby’s research initially challenged, even shocked senior military, but that shock resulted in fundamentally new understandings of the opportunities afforded by social media. For a senior academic at the Defence Studies Department at JSCSC, “\[Maltby’s\] research challenges much of the received wisdom about the MoD's understanding of both the digital environment and how defence practitioners operate within it” \[S3\]. For another figure involved in Royal Air Force communications at the highest level, the recommendation that “we shouldn’t even try to exert control was well made but potentially shocking”; but this shock led to the recognition that “it’s an important element that we need to tease out and agree on” \[S4\]. 

 The new understandings generated by Maltby’s research took military thinking away from focusing solely on risk. Thus Clare Parker, Head of Insight and Evaluation at the MOD, found that the “research gave me a better understanding of how we in the MOD need to manage the culture of risk aversion \[…\] Sarah’s work was brilliant and it distilled a lot of long term ‘niggles’ I had about social media and the way the military treated it. It was really helpful” \[S2\]. The shift away from an obsession with risk allowed the military to think and plan much more generatively around welfare, inclusivity and retention, recognising the crucial role that social media has in maintaining family life. Thus, for a former senior staff member involved in developing the Royal Navy’s Digital Strategy for Defence Communications, research “like Sarah’s is important \- if you get this right, you change lives” \[S1\]. For them, Maltby’s work is continuing to have impact, because it is used to “look at families and the impact on families through social media \[which\] can help to deliver a sort of strategic effect, which is all about retention” \[S1\]. 

 **Impact Legacy** 

 The British Military are necessarily a secretive institution and unwilling to fully acknowledge how they will exploit and deploy research findings. Thus Neil Verrall, Principal Psychologist in the Defence and Security Analysis Division of Defence Science and Technology Laboratory has only hesitantly revealed that further exploitation of Maltby’s findings is underway, “but due to classification of the projects/topics we cannot provide any further info…except to reassure you that your work is being used along with many other projects to articulate and understand specific issues of interest” \[S5\]. He is however emphatic: “please be reassured that your important work has not been forgotten” \[S5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Leith and colleagues have developed an extensive body of research on fiscal policy and its institutions in response to fiscal policy failures. They have used this research to develop principles and practice that have had a threefold impact on the redesign of Scottish arrangements: 

  

1.  The formation and design of the Scottish Fiscal Commission \(SFC\) in June 2014. 

1.  The Scottish Government’s bargaining position over the rules which support Scotland’s newly devolved fiscal powers following the independence referendum of 2014. 

1.  The development \(with Leith and Nolan as Commissioners\) of the SFC’s remit as it became a statutory body in April 2017.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **2.1. Exploring the design and implementation of macroeconomic stabilisation policy** 

 Between 2001 and 2011 Professor Leith was the Principal Investigator \(with co\-investigator Simon Wren\-Lewis of the University of Oxford\) on 3 ESRC\-funded projects exploring the design and implementation of macroeconomic stabilisation policy, especially fiscal policy. The research, particularly papers **\[3.1–3.5\]**, combined an analysis of public finances with Keynesian business cycles to describe how a benevolent policy maker should use fiscal policy over the business cycle. A key insight, in a variety of contexts, is that it is optimal to use government debt as a shock absorber and that following adverse economic events the policy maker needs to trade off the short\-run costs of fiscal austerity against the long\-run benefits of lower debt. One striking result from this analysis is that this balance is very fine—it is optimal to use fiscal policy to stabilise debt following a recession, but returning debt to its pre\-recession level should be undertaken only very slowly. 

 However, this policy recommendation assumes that the policy maker is both benevolent and able to make credible promises about their own future behaviour. In the absence of such an ability to commit, the government may be tempted to use inflation to reduce the real value of that debt. Moreover, in the real world, fiscal policy is typically implemented by governments subject to the constraints of the political process. For numerous reasons this may result in a ‘deficit bias’—a tendency for governments to run sub\-optimally high fiscal deficits—which can account for the rising government debt levels in many advanced economies over recent decades. Recognising the costs of such biases, many politicians have sought to tie their own hands by adopting some form of fiscal rule, which often requires debt and deficits to be stabilised over relatively short time horizons. However, possibly since such rules clearly violate the gradual fiscal adjustment implied by descriptions of optimal policy, they have often been broken at the point where they start to bite. This has happened so often that it is difficult to see such rules now having any credibility. 

 **2.2. Proposing the creation of independent fiscal councils** 

 An early statement of the policy implications of this research is **\[3.1\]**, which built on the work\-in\-progress subsequently published in **\[3.2, 3.3\]**. The research **\[3.1\]** proposed the creation of independent fiscal councils to help bring policy closer to the optimal one of gradual fiscal correction without resorting to excessive inflation or preventing the use of government debt as a shock absorber over the business cycle. The argument is that the adoption of a fiscal rule which is gradual and recognises the need to respond to the business cycle \(unlike the overly aggressive rules often adopted in practice\) may lack credibility, which the monitoring of outcomes relative to the rule by an independent fiscal council can help provide. Subsequent research, for example **\[3.4, 3.5\]**, has confirmed this insight in richer settings.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###   

 **4.1. Pathway to impact** 

 Through a long\-term consistent strategy of engagement with communities of policy making, economic forecasting and institutional design, Professor Leith and colleagues forged three principles from the underpinning research to shape policy and practice. First, the Scottish Fiscal Commission should be fully independent from the Scottish Government. Second, it should support fiscal sustainability. Third, the SFC, and its operating Fiscal Framework, should enable policy makers to respond flexibly to shocks. This third principle is the key insight from the underpinning research: the point of fiscal councils is to ensure unbiased fiscal forecasting and enhanced credibility in support of policies which mimic what we believe to be optimal policy. This is in contrast to the non\-credible fiscal rules which have been adopted and, just as quickly, abandoned in the past. 

 **4.2. The creation and evolution of the Scottish Fiscal Commission** 

 Ahead of the SFC being established, Scottish Government forecasts and their underlying methodologies were not independently scrutinised. Initially, that scrutiny was the central role for the SFC when it was created as a non\-statutory body in June 2014. However, following the independence referendum of the same year, additional borrowing and fiscal powers were granted to Scotland. As a result, the remit of the SFC expanded and its status changed from non\-statutory to statutory body in 2017. This change was acknowledged by the SFC becoming a member of the OECD’s group of recognised Independent Fiscal Institutions \(IFIs\). At this point the SFC assumed the role of official forecaster for Scotland. This marked a step change in Scotland’s economic policymaking. 

 The initial link in the chain of impact was the involvement of Professor Leith in calls for a fiscal council to be created for Scotland. The body of research explicitly underpinned Leith’s written evidence **\[5A\]** to the Finance Committee of the Scottish Parliament, which was relied on in supporting their recommendation that the SFC be created \(confirmed by the official report and transcript of Leith’s oral evidence **\[5B\]**\). For example, the report relies on Leith’s definition of the role of the SFC, ‘The objective of an independent fiscal body is summarised by Professor Campbell Leith as being “…to allow for short\-run flexibility in a way that adherence to fiscal rules may not allow, but to ensure that this does not jeopardise long\-run fiscal solvency.”’ 

 Upon the formation of the SFC, Leith was then invited by the Finance Minister to be one of three founding members \(Commissioners\) of the SFC \(confirmed by the Committee’s assessment of Leith’s nomination **\[5C\]**\). The fact that Leith was appointed as a founding Commissioner provides evidence that his vision for the role of the SFC was accepted by the Scottish Government \(confirmed by final report and transcript of oral evidence **\[5D\]**\). Leith was then joined by UofG colleague, Professor Nolan, who became a Commissioner in 2016, following the resignation of one of the original Commissioners. 

 **4.3. Informing the Scottish Government’s negotiating position** 

 Professor Leith was also involved in providing evidence to the Scottish Parliament on the appropriate form of fiscal rules for Scotland, which informed their negotiating position in agreeing the Fiscal Framework governing the implementation of further fiscal powers following the Scottish independence referendum of 2014. This written evidence again cited and drew on the published research of the UofG researchers named above **\[5E\]**. The final report of the Finance Committee relied heavily on this evidence in formulating its recommendations, which were broadly accepted by the Scottish Government as its bargaining position \(confirmed by official report **\[5F\]**\). 

 For example, the report cites Leith’s view on fiscal rules, “Professor Campbell Leith suggests that ‘fiscal targets should facilitate the use of debt as a shock absorber.’ If the ‘borrowing limit is too low, the effective use of government debt as a shock absorber will be compromised.’ These fiscal targets ‘should apply over a sufficiently long time horizon to allow gradual adjustment to the target and the time horizon should be rolling. The targets should also be set in terms of deficits and not debt’” **\[5E\]**. This was used to justify the Committee’s recommendations, “The Committee’s view is that it is clear that the level of borrowing powers for current spending will need to be significantly increased and should be commensurate with the risks faced by the Scottish Government post–Smith. The Committee notes that the precise types of risk Scotland may be exposed to will be determined by the block grant adjustment method which is intended to insulate Scotland from UK\-wide economic shocks. At the same time there will also be a Scotland\-specific cyclical risk and the Scottish Government will require substantial new borrowing powers to manage this volatility” **\[5F\]**. 

 **4.4. The design and ongoing development of Scotland’s fiscal framework** 

 In light of the further devolution of fiscal powers, the provision of evidence on how the SFC’s remit should evolve was an ongoing aspect of Professor Leith and Nolan’s roles as Commissioners. This was done formally in both closed and open sessions of Committees of the Scottish Parliament, particularly the Finance Committee \(confirmed by official reports **\[5G\]\[5H\]\[5I\]**\). However, Commissioners were also regularly briefed on, and able to influence, the drafting of the legislation which formalised the SFC’s status and remit as a statutory body. Leith and Nolan were also heavily involved in designing the structure of the SFC, as well as its way of operating, as it expanded to a staff of approximately 20 people. Moreover, Professor Nolan represented the SFC on a parliamentary committee, The Budget Progress Review Group, which sought to change the budget process to enhance both the Scottish Parliament and SFC’s scrutiny of the Scottish Budget following the creation of the SFC \(confirmed by official report **\[5J\]**\). 

 The initial evidence Professor Leith gave to the Scottish Parliament made the general case for fiscal councils, but also included specific recommendations for the Scottish context \(confirmed by written evidence **\[5A\]**\). In particular, it stressed the need to ensure cooperation rather than conflict with the UK sister body, the Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\). For example from the Finance Committee’s Report **\[5B\]**, “The matter of the relationship between an independent fiscal body and the OBR was commented on by Professor Leith \[…\] an independent Scottish Fiscal Council could enhance the policy making process by making independent forecasts of variables of sole interest to Scotland. For other items which impact on both Scotland and the rest of the UK, a formal working relationship between the Scottish Fiscal Council and the OBR which aims to produce a single consensus forecast would facilitate the gains from cooperation, without undermining the credibility of either body.” To this end, upon being appointed as a Commissioner, Professor Leith promoted the holding of regular meetings with the OBR to ensure there was a shared reconciliation of their respective forecasts, thereby preventing any differences being exploited politically. Thereafter, Professors Leith and Nolan were in regular contact with the OBR. 

 **4.5. Beneficiaries** 

 The establishment of the SFC has reduced suspicion of politically influenced forecasts, generated trust in its work and enhanced fiscal transparency. An OECD review of the SFC \(2019\) confirms that, “\[it\] has been successful in establishing constructive relationships with key stakeholders and has quickly developed a reputation for delivering independent and credible forecasts. The SFC’s independence is underpinned by strong enabling legislation … The SFC has become a voice of authority, and is credited with enriching the fiscal policy debate in Scotland. It has significant engagement with the Scottish Parliament and receives broad media coverage” **\[5K\]**. Chapter 5 of the OECD review further evidences the positive impact of the SFC. As Scotland’s official forecaster, it has a direct influence on the parameters of the annual budget and informs MSPs \(who between April 2017 and May 2019 made 62 references to the SFC in parliamentary questions\). In addition, the OECD found that through its reports, website, social media, press conferences and regular interactions with journalists, the SFC has established significant media impact **\[5K\]**. Thus, the ultimate beneficiaries of this impact are the people of Scotland and the evolving devolved governance of the country.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by Dr Nik Hammer at the University of Leicester School of Business was the first to show that after years of outsourcing and offshoring, much of the renewed growth in UK apparel manufacturing was based on unauthorised subcontracting and exploitative employment practices, and was linked to the growing supply chains of high\-street brands. Subsequent engagement with industry and policy makers led to improvements in the supply chain practices of UK high street fashion retailers. Hammer’s work generated new awareness amongst both industry and policy stakeholders regarding specific challenges of fast fashion and enabled lead firms to develop a new social auditing methodology. Two parliamentary inquiries \(‘Business and Human Rights’; ‘Sustainability of Fast Fashion’\) utilised the research to inform policy recommendations on supply chain transparency and labour market governance, whilst a new UK\-wide, public\-private industrial governance framework was developed by stakeholders in industry underpinned by Hammer’s research. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 As supermarkets and online retailers developed fast fashion business strategies \(based on quick response manufacturing and lean retailing\) and emerged as competitors for traditional fashion retail, UK fast fashion manufacturing expanded at above average growth rates since 2007, with Leicester and the East Midlands becoming the largest sourcing hub nationally **\[R2\]**. In 2019, it was estimated that in Leicester alone, 10,000 textile workers were producing >1million items of clothing every week \(House of Commons debate ‘ [Fashion Industry’](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-01-31/debates/71C6AC48-9F09-407F-8283-C29A8BB17DCD/FashionIndustry?highlight=%22fast%20fashion%22), January 2019\) **.** Major UK high street retailers and industry stakeholders, however, grew concerned that competitiveness was achieved through violations in work and employment conditions in their supply chains, particularly where contracted suppliers covertly sub\-contracted orders to factories with lower employment standards. Leading retailers commissioned a research report through the Ethical Trading Initiative \(ETI\) to establish an evidence base to enable nationwide change which was published in 2015 **\[R3\]** and received widespread attention in industrial, political and public spheres. Three aspects of the underpinning research are of particular importance: 

1.  Robust evidence on systemic labour exploitation and unauthorised subcontracting in the supply chain 

 Hammer provided the first robust evidence of how the fast fashion value chain increased the asymmetries between lead firms and manufacturers and led to a deterioration in work and employment conditions **\[R3\]**. The ‘going’ wage rate for most garment workers was found to be just £3 per hour, less than half the 2015 National Minimum Wage. Workers had no employment contracts and were subject to intense and arbitrary work practices **\[R1\]**. Unpaid wages resulting from precarious employment relationships and an intense labour process amounted to 20% of the industry’s gross value added. This number strikingly underscores the costs and suffering caused by non\-compliant practices that violate minimum standards for leading firms, manufacturers and workers. Such non\-compliance exposes lead firms and the local economy to considerable reputational risk, disadvantages compliant manufacturers and thoroughly fails to protect workers. 

1.  Governance gaps in brands’ supply chain management as well as in public policy 

 Hammer **\[R3\]** provided a thorough analysis of regulatory challenges in addressing key governance gaps. Fast fashion supply chains have skewed the playing field further to the advantage of leading brands and retailers while emerging, very fragmented industry structures have rendered existing forms of private and public regulation unfit for purpose \(the average size of a garment manufacturer has dropped below 10 employees, at the same time as phoenixing companies have become common\). In practice, supply chain accountability tends to be undermined by the push of large retailers’ sourcing and purchasing practices, the pull of a vulnerable labour supply, as well as weakened labour market regulations and enforcement practices. 

1.  Recommendations that outline the key fault lines for private and public regulation 

 The recommendations by Hammer **\[R3\]** identified crucial areas along the entire supply chain required to develop and implement effective industry\-wide governance structures. These areas include supply chain transparency and accountability, the ringfencing of labour costs when subcontracting, payment of wages into bank accounts rather than cash\-in\-hand, and increased centrality of union and community organisation involvement. Some lead firms and industry stakeholders have actively examined and trialled new forms of governing social compliance in the supply chain. Key experiments and discussions have followed the recommendations of Hammer’s work **\[R3\]** and focus on increasing supply chain transparency, devising novel ways to combine private monitoring with public enforcement, as well as developing capacity and structures between lead firms, manufacturers, workers and government to enable said enforcement. 

  

 The **R3** research consisted of a team within the University of Leicester Centre for Sustainable Work and Employment Futures. The research was led by Dr N Hammer \(Associate Professor\) with Prof P Nolan, Prof I Clark \(left UoL in July 2017\), and Reka Plugor \(Lecturer\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Hammer’s research **\[R1\-R3\]** provided the first robust evidence of widespread unauthorised subcontracting and employment practices in the UK fast fashion industry. The original research **\[R3\]** was funded by the Ethical Trading Initiative \(ETI\) and has significantly impacted members since. The ETI is a leading alliance of companies \(high street and online retailers as well as department stores\), trade unions, and non\-governmental organisations \(such as Homeworkers Worldwide or Traidcraft\) that promotes respect for workers' rights around the globe. The research findings and subsequent engagement with ETI members, industrial stakeholders and policymakers has substantially improved their understanding and awareness of working practices, thereby enabling nationwide changes in policy, procedure and structural changes, whilst simultaneously stimulating changes in the public perception of fast fashion. 

 **Expert Input to Policy Debate and Formulation** 

 Hammer and Nolan’s evidence to policy makers **\[E1, E2a\]** was instrumental in establishing employment standards and supply chain governance in the fashion industry as high\-priority political issues. 

 In March 2017, The Joint Committee on Human Rights \(JCHR\) ‘Business and Human Rights Inquiry’ visited Leicester to investigate the serious labour rights abuses identified by Hammer’s research **\[E1,** p.17 **\]**. The JCHR requested a personal session for Hammer and Nolan to present and discuss their research findings in detail at which the Committee *‘heard compelling evidence’* \(p.18\). The published report of the inquiry utilised Hammer et al.’s research extensively, particularly drawing on their recommendations including those covering transparency in supply chains, extension of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority’s \(GLAA\) remit, local authorities’ closure powers, audits and trade union membership and access to remedies **\[E1\]**. The GLAA is an executive non\-departmental public body, sponsored by the Home Office, to protect vulnerable and exploited workers. 

 The Parliamentary inquiry on the Sustainability of Fast Fashion drew on Hammer **\[R3\]**; evidence submitted by Unite The Union **\[E2a\]** also used Hammer’s research as the basis of their evidence: *“Research conducted by the University of Leicester reveals that around 2,500 workers in Leicester’s garment sector worked in appalling conditions; without worker status and any kind of employment contract, the majority of these workers earn £3 per hour, well below the minimum wage and receive wages cash in hand… The study also revealed inadequate health and safety standards; bullying; coercion; violence; humiliation and health problems often reported by workers in the secto*r.” **\[E2b\]**. 

 Evidence provided by Hammer **\[R3\]** and discussions at ETI’s Leicester Garment Industry Working Group enabled ETI and brands to successfully lobby for the UK garment industry to be defined as a priority sector for the GLAA. This ensured that the GLAA received investigative powers over garment manufacturers and led to the development of the Apparel and General Merchandise Public Private Protocol \(AGM PPP\); the first public\-private initiative in this field *“which committed signatories to work together to raise awareness to prevent worker exploitation, protect vulnerable and exploited workers and disrupt exploitative practices and help bring criminals to justice*”. **\[E3\]**. 

 New media exposés of violations of work and employment practices in 2020, particularly in Boohoo’s supply chain, further intensified the political focus on problems first identified by Hammer et al **\[R3\]** leading to his expert involvement across a variety of policymaking fora throughout 2020. Hammer: 

-  gave evidence to the All Party Parliamentary Committee for Ethics and Sustainability in Fashion **\[E4\]**; 

-  was invited to share 1\-2\-1 expertise by a range of government agencies, such as the Low Pay Commission, the Independent Anti\-Slavery Commissioner, and Leicester City Council; 

-  was asked to provide expertise in workshops on compliance and enforcement by GLAA as well as the Director of Labour Market Enforcement. 

 **Improved tools and practices for compliance in fast fashion supply chains** 

 Following publication of the 2015 report **\[R3\]** Hammer became an advisor to the ETI Leicester Garment Industry Working Group, which devised a host of initiatives subsequently adopted by brands individually or collectively. ETI members include global companies with a combined turnover of GBP166,000,000,000, their company members include supermarkets, fashion retailers and department stores such as NEXT and ASOS. These changes substantially enhanced supply chain standards and practices in each case, and advanced development of private\-public relationships to improve compliance and industry\-wide governance. 

 In an immediate response to the research evidence, ETI member brands strengthened their supply chain monitoring and enforcement practices, and improved supply chain transparency. Key amongst these initiatives was the development of a tailor\-made forensic auditing tool under the Fast Forward programme **\[E5\]**. By enacting Fast Forward auditing processes, brands were able to engage in remediation measures with manufacturers and focus their sourcing on compliant suppliers. Implementing these processes across their UK operations formalised and enacted robust social auditing practices and led to closer, more continuous, business relations between brands and manufacturers, which ETI confirm *“has helped improved work and employment conditions and reduced their reputational risk”* **\[E6\]**. Not only did Hammer’s research prompt the establishment of programmes like Fast Forward, but “ *Importantly, however, Dr Hammer’s recommendations regarding supply chain transparency, accountability, the inclusion of worker and community voice underpin the development of a game\-changing public\-private model of governance for the industry in the Apparel and General Merchandise Public Private Protocol”* **\[E6\]**. Following **\[R3\]**, ETI members, Tesco and Community\-The Union, concluded an agreement to conduct auditing visits jointly **\[E6\]**, which allowed union workplace access. Taking action as ETI members in the wake of **\[R3\]** the CEOs of ASOS and New Look, approached the Mayor of Leicester to initiate ongoing dialogue on support for a sustainable garment industry **\[E5, E7\]**. Underpinning this, and with Hammer providing expert input, the Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership \(LLEP\) established a textiles and fashion hub to support businesses **\[E8\]**. Contract negotiations for this hub started in 2019 and but were delayed. The contract was signed and the hub publicly announced in January 2021. 

  

 **Putting industry governance on a new private\-public footing** 

 Hammer has worked with a wide range of industry stakeholders to advise on their planned initiatives, from Parliamentary Inquiries and consultations on labour market enforcement, to projects by trade unions and community organisations. The events of Spring 2020 \- where manufacturers were found to have increased production for Boohoo during the Covid\-19 pandemic, potentially violating lockdown regulations \- have injected new urgency to stakeholder deliberations on compliance and governance in the garment industry. In autumn 2019, Hammer drew on **\[R3\]** to advise Labour behind the Label \(LBL\) and Homeworkers Worldwide  on their submission to the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy consultation ‘Good work plan: establishing a new single enforcement body for employment rights’, specifically regarding supply chain provisions in the fast fashion industry **\[E9\]**. In 2020, LBL produced a hugely impactful report on the conditions in Leicester for workers supplying the Boohoo group and other UK Brands, using **\[R3\]** throughout. LBL state that **\[R3\]** *“continues to be used by LBL and many others in providing the most reliable and comprehensive set of information and analysis on wages, working conditions and supply chain workers in Leicester and the socio\-economic impact of current practices”* **\[E9\]**. 

 The significant attention afforded to working practices in fashion during the pandemic has led to increased demand for Hammer’s expertise across a range of media and policy fora to inform public debate and policy/practice change. 

-  In September 2020 Hammer authored an opinion piece in The Guardian, arguing for transparency, broad stakeholder inclusion, and accountability as key pillars for a new public\-private governance of the garment industry. **\[E10\]** 

-  In November 2020, Liz Kendall \(MP for Leicester West\) tabled a debate in the House of Commons; ‘Worker Exploitation: Leicester Textile Industry’ bringing the issue into national focus once more. Hammer’s report **\[R3\]** was cited as the first time in which the issue had been highlighted to policymakers **\[E11\]**. 

 Hammer was invited to join a renewed Apparel and General Merchandise Public Private Protocol \(AGM PPP\) which was significantly widened and relaunched following the media exposés on the Boohoo supply chain. This constitutes the first coordinated collaborative initiative to improve working conditions and prevent labour exploitation by including worker and community voices, shared monitoring protocols, transparency, accountability and advocacy **\[E3\].** The comprehensive aim of the AGM PPP, regarding the governance of private monitoring\-public enforcement as well as its comprehensive remit, are game changers in the regulation of the fast fashion value chain.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Church of England is responsible for the welfare of 1.14 million worshippers, with over 20,000 clergy members supporting its 12,400 parishes nationwide. However, over recent decades, congregation sizes and church incomes have shrunk: as a result, fewer clergy members have fewer resources to cover the work. This has led to increased administrative demands on clergy, undermining their wellbeing and effectiveness. To address this problem, in 2011, the Church of England commissioned Dr Clinton at King’s Business School to analyse clergy calling, wellbeing and effectiveness. The research evidenced ways in which clergy can be more effective in their roles and, through a seven\-year programme of extensive research and engagement, devised a new approach to enhancing clergy wellbeing – a topic that has long been a challenge for the Church of England. In contributing to a shift to more evidence\-based policymaking, the findings influenced key Church of England decisions around how to support clergy wellbeing and effectiveness, including the recruitment of nine clergy support roles in the Diocese of Sheffield, benefitting the local community of parishioners in some of the most deprived neighbourhoods of Sheffield.

 Although religion has been the focal point of many UK local communities for centuries, congregation sizes and church incomes have reduced in recent years. As a result, the remaining clergy often have to work across several sites with reduced help from volunteers. At the General Synod \(the national assembly of the Church of England\), Archbishop Rowan Williams noted that clergy effectiveness and worshipper numbers were intrinsically linked, stating that “effective ministerial presence is essential if people are to be in touch with the faithfulness of God through the Church”. 

#  A seven\-year longitudinal survey to study clergy effectiveness 

 In 2011, the Church of England approached Dr Michael Clinton of King’s Business School with concerns that clergy calling and wellbeing were being undermined by the pressure caused by shrinking congregations and increasing administrative demands. The research challenge dovetailed with King’s expertise in organisational psychology, specifically in thinking about how different types of motivation might shape the relationship between a person’s calling for a job or vocation and their wellbeing. The research commenced in 2011 with the lead project, Experience of Ministry Survey \(EMS\), which was complemented by a series of linked projects that ran simultaneously. EMS collected data on a nationally representative sample of clergy at four time\-points \(2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017\). Over 6,000 clergy members responded to questions about tasks and activities they were regularly engaged in, how they approached their role and the positive and negative aspects of their experiences as priests. Innovative measures of role effectiveness included assessment of positive clergy wellbeing \(feelings of engagement and avoidance of burnout\), discernment of vocation \(a fulfilled sense of purpose or mission\) and congregational growth \(in terms of both perceived spiritual wellbeing amongst those served and numerical growth in worshipping community\). 

 The projects linked with EMS commenced in 2013 and 2015, and were respectively entitled the Patterns of Priestly Practice \(3P\) and the Calling Far and Wide project. Both projects complemented the EMS data by providing a forensic understanding of what clergy do on a day\-to\-day basis and the influence of their daily tasks on their effectiveness. Over 300 priests and chaplains completed additional daily diaries for the two projects. By the end of the EMS survey in 2017, the research findings concluded that a ‘Big 4’ set of predictors of clergy effectiveness were supported by the cross\-sectional and longitudinal analyses of each; these were as follows: \(i\) experiencing a strong and consistent calling; \(ii\) receiving useful feedback; \(iii\) having colleague support; and \(iv\) engaging in proactive role crafting. 

#  Research contribution: revealing the effects of clergy calling on clergy wellbeing, vigour and effectiveness 

 The data collected through survey and diary data allowed Clinton and Sturges \(together with other colleagues at King’s College London and at Royal Holloway, University of London\) to study the development process of clergy calling though a sensemaking lens. Sensemaking is a dynamic process of developing subjective meaning that involves individuals striving to understand and make sense of events. The research explored retrospective accounts of clergy members’ sensemaking regarding their vocational calling. It examined how individuals narrated the emergence of their calling, how they interpreted and acted upon cues and prompts that directed them towards it and how the socio\-material context of the calling domain influenced the unfolding of their calling. The analysis indicated that the emergence of a calling was not a discrete event but an ongoing process of sensemaking. It was characterized by interplay between extracted cues, sensemaking through action and interpretation, the church context in which the participants' calling occurred and developed, and individuals' evolving identity \[1\]. 

 While the project contributed to a broader understanding of the development of calling, it also highlighted the possible downsides of work that is strongly motived by a vocation. Although the intensity of a calling has a positive direct effect on work\-related vigour, it can also motivate people to work longer hours by limiting their psychological detachment from work in the evenings, for example. In turn, this affects sleep quality and morning vigour, leading to decreased effectiveness at work. Overall, the study showed how the benefits of intense calling could sometimes be nullified by the costs \[2\]. 

 These findings shed light on the specific causes of clergy burnout. The data collected through 3P and the 2011 and 2013 bi\-annual EMS surveys revealed that the role of members of the clergy involved administrative duties that were hugely time\-consuming and found to be antithetical to most clergy’s sense of calling \[2\]. A major finding of the 3P research was that on a daily basis, clergy spent more time on administrative tasks than on practising core aspects of their calling and that this had major implications for their wellbeing and motivation \[2,3\]. The findings showed that clergy ranked administration first out of the 14 tasks they were surveyed on, averaging three hours per day. In contrast, they ranked it 12th in terms of relevance to their calling and 11th in terms of tasks they felt competent doing. Further analysis of the data revealed that clergy members expended much of their resources on self\-control on days that required extensive administrative duties, causing conflict between their working and non\-working hours in the day: over time, this pattern of working is likely to lead to clergy burnout \[4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The implications of innovative research at King’s Business School gained widespread attention within the Church of England. The findings contributed to a significant organisational shift towards evidence\-based policymaking within the Church, improving clergy effectiveness and the wellbeing of their communities. 

#  Encouraging a shift to evidence\-based policymaking in the Church of England 

 The project produced over 20 internal reports for the Church of England, tackling issues related to clergy wellbeing and effectiveness across the country \[A\]. The reports were viewed by a range of national policy bodies, including the House of Bishops and Ministry Council, and discussed annually at the National Continuing Ministerial Development Panel. As noted by Dr Tim Ling, former Head of Ministry Development in the Church of England, “The results \[referring to A, \(i\)\] were circulated to all diocesan Bishops in the Church of England and to their lead offices. This resulted in active debates about the nature of good practice, resource allocation and policy development” \[B\]. The research was drawn upon within key debates regarding clergy wellbeing at national and local levels \[C\]. For example, in June 2017, the General Synod dedicated a large proportion of their meeting to discussing clergy wellbeing, keeping the findings from this research at the heart of discussion on the need to better understand wellbeing issues for change to occur \[C, \(i\)\]. The research contributed to conversations about clergy work more widely, with the Church Times publishing three articles about the findings \[D\]. The articles highlighted the need for greater support for clergy under pressure, explicitly stating that “the study will inform ongoing work in the House of Clergy on well\-being” \[D, \(ii\)\]. 

 These sustained conversations led to a shift in thinking within the Church of England. A major legacy of the project is its role as a catalyst for a change in the organisational mindset relating to evidence\-based policy development within the organisation. As noted by Dr Ling “… the decision\-making culture within the National Church of England in this area has fundamentally changed in terms of the extent to which it draws on evidence and has resulted in increased investment in new research to support future policy decision, including the appointment of a full\-time researcher in its Ministry Division nationally to lead on the Living Ministry Project” \[B\]. 

#  Enhancing clergy wellbeing and effectiveness 

 The shift to evidence\-based policy\-making across the Church of England has had a concrete, positive impact on the working lives of clergy. The evidence provided by King’s research led to higher investment in clergy wellbeing and professional development. One of the most significant and high\-level impacts was on the future of nationwide theological education. The research provided evidence to support a major review by the Archbishops’ Council, seeking to understand the impact of investment on theological education nationally \(GBP12,000,000 per annum\). “The findings influenced how individual dioceses invested in continuing professional education shifting their practice and investment to areas of work identified by the research as being effective. The work also informed the formation of a new national Nurture Course \(Pilgrim\) for new Christians” \[B\]. 

 A second notable investment, again in direct response to the research findings, is the Mission Partnership Development Worker \(MPDW\) project launched by the Diocese of Sheffield. The Church of England granted the Diocese GBP1,000,000 to run the MPDW project from 2015 to 2021 \[E\]. The project provides administrative support to clusters of 33 neighbouring parishes in the most deprived areas of Sheffield to allow clergy to devote more time to their calling and connecting with parishioners. A video prepared by the research team to promote the scheme to prospective clergy members of the Diocese of Sheffield features clergy who found the new scheme helpful. Rev Philip Ireson explains that he has noticed a difference in his workload since the beginning of the scheme: “I can now be thinking of developing youth work, for instance, which I couldn't have done” \[F\]. 

 Thirty clergy members gave further description of the impact that the project had had on their lives, demonstrating a reduction in their administrative workload, freeing time for other activities. For example, two years into the MPDW project, compared with those from a control group \(n=18\), clergy with a support worker \(n=13\) reported spending more time on mission\-related activities and performing activities that they feel competent at \[A, \(iii\)\]. Other reported advantages of reduced administrative workload included feelings of connectedness, closer working relationships with clergy in other parishes and more opportunities to share resources and ideas. The Project Manager to the Diocese of Sheffield, Graham Millar, noted the value of the scheme beyond clergy wellbeing: “ *the Mission Partnership Development Workers have benefitted clergy in receipt of such workers, parishioner attendance and the financial position of their churches*” \[E\]. 

#  Improving community life in the Dioceses of Sheffield 

 The MPDW project created jobs for nine support workers and potentially benefitted the 3,000 parishioners within the parishes that received additional support. For example, findings in internal reports produced for the Church of England \[A\] demonstrated that clergy with support were able to spend more time working with children and young people within their parish. A year later, the support workers remained in their roles and virtually all clergy involved in the project cited community events and new parishioner\-led activities that were made possible by the project. One priest with a support worker reported that “having an MPDW lift the burden of admin has enabled me to spend more time with people, in particular running groups and courses in evangelism and discipleship. These groups and courses have been hugely beneficial in the spiritual health of our church family”. \[A, \(iv\), p2\] Another clergy member stated that “Within six months \[of getting a support worker\] we have got a messy church off the ground, new Sunday morning activities, more school engagement” \[A, \(iii\), p6\]. 

 Two prominent parishioners in the diocese noted the impact of the scheme on the activities and initiatives that were run in their parishes: 

 “*The parish nursing programme would not have happened without our Development Worker and it has greatly impacted the community by encouraging healthy children and families in one of the ten most deprived parishes in the country. The nursing scheme reaches out to people who are on the fringes of society who otherwise could not or would not contact GP services, because they may not have the means or confidence*” \[G\]. 

 “*Having a Development Worker means we are more capable running larger events that extend much further into the community… activities included soft archery and Dr Bike and the event was attended by the police, fire, and ambulance services \(who brought their vehicles\). The children saw the emergency services in a different light which is hoped will build trust between children and these groups. Building such trust is crucial, especially with the police*” \[H\]. 

 Overall, the seven\-year King’s research programme has significantly influenced decision\-making within the Church of England, leading to enhanced clergy wellbeing and effectiveness, and improved activities and services for the parishioners of the Diocese of Sheffield.

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research has shown that regular consumption of sugar\-sweetened drinks leads to obesity and overweight in both children and adults, as well as increasing tooth decay. Obesity reduces life expectancy and increases the chance of serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and has also been linked to worse outcomes from COVID\-19. University of Oxford research contributed directly to the introduction of sugary drinks taxes in the UK, Ireland and Mexico and indirectly to the introduction of similar taxes around the world. The UK and Mexico taxes have already led to demonstrated reductions in the sale of sugary drinks and levels of sugar consumption from these products. Modelling studies based on these results indicate that the resulting health benefits are significant, including reduced incidence of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Overweight and obesity are estimated to account for about 4,000,000 deaths annually worldwide. Obesity is a major cause of diabetes, which is currently estimated to affect 450,000,000 people worldwide \(1 in 11 adults\) but this is expected to rise to more than 700,000,000 by 2045 as obesity rates continue to increase. Consequently, there is an urgent need for comprehensive national policies aimed at restricting the major environmental determinants of obesity. 

 Research led by Professor Jonathan Emberson generated clear evidence of the increasing burden of obesity and of type 2 diabetes in Mexico. The Mexico City Prospective Study \(MCPS\) was initiated in 1994 by Oxford researchers Professor Sir Richard Peto and Professor Sir Rory Collins in collaboration with epidemiologists in Mexico \(Professor Roberto Tapia\-Conyer, Professor Pablo Kuri\-Morales and Doctor Jesus Alegre\-Diaz\). Professor Emberson joined the team in 2004 and has been the UK Principal Investigator of the study since 2013.The MCPS represents a long\-standing collaboration between researchers at the University of Oxford and researchers at the Mexican Ministry of Health and the National Autonomous University of Mexico \(Mexico City\). Between 1998 and 2004, 150,000 people aged 35 years or older from Mexico City were recruited, interviewed, had measurements and a blood sample taken, and then followed for cause\-specific mortality. The University of Oxford researchers designed the questionnaire used in the baseline assessment, assessed the blood samples collected and analysed the data. By the early 2010s, the study was starting to generate reliable evidence regarding the major causes of premature death in Mexico. In 2016, the study showed that diabetes was responsible for twice as many Mexican deaths as had previously been thought based on studies undertaken in higher income countries \[1\]. By 60 to 74 years of age, approximately one quarter of the participants in the cohort had a medical diagnosis of diabetes \(compared with approximately 7% in an equivalent population in the UK\) and diabetes accounted for over a third \(35%\) of all deaths between 35 and 74 years of age. 

 In parallel, University of Oxford researchers developed population simulation models to predict the impact of health\-related food taxation policies and possible industry responses in various countries including the UK \[2, 3, 4, 5\], Ireland \[6\], New Zealand and Denmark. These models incorporated data on sales and consumption of unhealthy foods \(high in sugar, salt or saturated fat\), price elasticity estimates, and estimates of the association between unhealthy foods and disease outcomes. Collectively, these studies indicated that taxing unhealthy food products could be an effective method to reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity\-related disease outcomes, including type 2 diabetes. In response to a lack of UK data on the possible consequences of a sugary drinks tax, University of Oxford researchers led a study in collaboration with Reading University to develop a model to estimate the effects of a 20% sugary drinks tax on UK purchasing habits, obesity, and expenditure by income \[4\]. The Oxford researchers designed the study, planned the analyses, built the comparative risk assessment model and published the results. Reading University researchers conducted the econometric work necessary to produce a bespoke price elasticity matrix. The model predicted that once the full effect of the tax was borne out, the prevalence of obesity in adults in the UK would decrease by 1.3% \(180,000 people\), compared with the situation if the tax had not been introduced. The Oxford researchers then collaborated with the University of Dublin to conduct a similar study for the Irish Government, with comparable results for Ireland \[6\]. 

 Between 2013 and the announcement, by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, of a Soft Drinks Industry Levy for the UK in 2016, University of Oxford researchers  developed further evidence to evaluate the effects of health\-related food taxes,  for example by addressing concerns raised by the Institute of Fiscal Studies’ about the efficacy of a sugary drinks tax. In response to the announcement of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, the researchers developed a bespoke model to understand the impact of different industry responses \(e.g. reformulation vs price changes\) on obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay \[5\]. This model indicated that the most effective industry response would be widespread reformulation of sugary drinks, which would significantly decrease the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as reducing the number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth annually.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The University of Oxford’s research into health\-related food and drink taxes has had significant international impact, contributing directly to the introduction of sugary drinks taxes in Mexico \(2014\), the UK \(2018\) and Ireland \(2018\) and influencing the introduction of similar taxes around the world. By December 2020, according to the World Cancer Research Fund, there were sugary drinks taxes in 38 countries \[A\]. 

####  A. Creating a favourable policy environment for new sugary drinks taxes 

 **Mexico:** For over 20 years the University of Oxford has worked closely with researchers in Mexico including \(during the period 2011 \- 2018\) the Undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion of the Mexican Ministry of Health. As testified by the Undersecretary, this close collaboration and discussion of the research evidence meant that ‘ *even before results were published, the findings from the Mexico City Prospective Study influenced health policy decision making in matters related to non\-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. In particular, the study influenced both the decision in 2014 to introduce taxes on sugary drinks and the declaration in 2016 of diabetes and obesity as epidemiologic emergencies \(the first time this had been done for non\-communicable diseases\)’* \[B\]. The 2016 declaration led to the introduction of a wide range of health policies aimed at tackling and treating obesity and diabetes, including healthy eating, on\-pack labelling, medical check\-ups and physical activity. The introduction of the sugary drinks tax in Mexico was the catalyst for similar adoptions by other countries, as acknowledged by international agencies: *‘The passage, implementation and subsequent evaluation of Mexico’s SSB \(Sugar sweetened beverage\) tax \(implemented 1 January 2014\) acted as a tipping point for global action’,* World Cancer Research Fund International \[C\]. 

 **UK:** The introduction of a sugary drinks tax in Mexico led to the proposal among UK policy makers for a similar tax for Britain. One of the UK modelling studies conducted by Oxford University \[4\] was cited in Public Health England \(PHE\)’s policy document **‘** *Sugar reduction, Responding to the challenge’* \[D\] \(June 2014\) In their subsequent report ‘ *Sugar Reduction, The evidence for action*’ \[D\] \(October 2015\) PHE specifically recommended the introduction of ‘ *a price increase of a minimum of 10\-20% on high sugar products through the use of a tax or levy such as on full sugar soft drinks, based on the emerging evidence of the impact of such measures in other countries*.’ 

 The recommendation from PHE was discussed during the UK Parliamentary Health Select Committee’s inquiry into childhood obesity in October 2015. Professors Susan Jebb and Peter Scarborough presented oral evidence to the committee, which included discussing the evidence from Mexico which indicated that such a tax would be effective in the UK. The resulting report ‘ *Childhood obesity – brave and bold action’* \(November 2015\) \[E\] recommended a sugary drinks tax in the UK and stated that ‘ *The evidence suggests that increasing the price of high sugar products by 10–20% or more through the use of a tax or levy would be likely to have an effect on purchasing behaviour and therefore sugar consumption at least in the short term’*. During a debate in Parliament on this recommendation \(November 2015\), the Chair of the Select Committee \(Sarah Wollaston MP\), said, ‘ *We know from the experience in Mexico that a 10% levy on sugary drinks has led to a 6% reduction in consumption’* \[F\]. 

 This report had a direct impact on the opinions of MPs, who then spoke in support of the tax in Parliament in November 2015 \[F\]: 

-  *‘During the Select Committee’s inquiry, we heard some compelling evidence calling for brave and bold action on obesity…A few months ago I was against a sugary drinks tax, because I am against extra taxation, but the compelling evidence that we heard changed my mind.’* 

 MP for Erewash, Maggie Throup 

-  *‘Following the introduction of the tax on sugar\-sweetened drinks \(in Mexico\), purchases were reduced by 6% in 2014. We need to be aware of the evidence showing that a tax will actually reduce the purchases of sugary drinks’,* MP for Heywood and Middleton, Liz McInnes 

-  *‘As I have looked into the issue more and more, I have reached the position where I find the evidence compelling: something needs to be done.’*  MP for St Austell and Newquay, Steve Double. 

 This increased political support, coupled with greater public acceptance \(described below\), led to the announcement of the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy \(SDIL\) in March 2016. 

 **Ireland:** The publication of the modelling studies \[2\] and \[3\] led to the researchers being commissioned by the Irish Government’s Department of Health in 2011 to carry out a modelling study of a 10% tax. This was incorporated within a health impact assessment \(HIA\) published by the Irish Institute of Public Health in 2012 and then subsequently in BMC Public Health \[6\]. This led to a recommendation by the Department of Health for the introduction of ‘ *a graded tax on pre\-packaged \[sugar\-sweetened soft drinks\] on sale in Ireland’* in 2016 \[G\]. As supporting evidence, the Department of Health referenced the HIA: *‘\[the HIA\] found evidence that ‘taxation could work to reduce overweight and obesity’ depending on the level of tax imposed…\[and\] concluded that a 10% tax on the price of SSDs \[sugary drinks\] would reduce obesity by 1.25% among adults in Ireland’* \[G\]. The recommendation for a tax was acted upon by the Irish Government, which introduced a tax in April 2018. 

 **International:** The success of the tax on sugary drinks in Mexico influenced WHO’s stance on using fiscal measures to reduce sugar consumption \[H\]. In their influential report ‘ *Tackling NCDs \(Noncommunicable Diseases\): Best Buys’* \[H\], WHO includes as a ‘best buy’ policy recommendation: ‘ *Reduce sugar consumption through effective taxation on sugar\-sweetened beverages.’* This report has contributed to the roll out of sugary drinks taxation policies worldwide. The World Cancer Research Fund tracks international food policies and currently notes sugary drinks taxes 39 countries including 10 in Europe \[A\]. Of these, 37 have been implemented since the introduction of the tax in Mexico in 2014, with many countries citing evidence of the link between sugar consumption, weight gain, overweight and obesity as a driving factor. 

####  B. Changing public attitudes towards sugary drinks taxes 

 The work of the researchers resulted in extensive media attention and public discussion of the issue. For example, Professor Mike Rayner appeared in BBC2’s Trust Me I’m a Doctor \(2014\) in a feature exploring the health impacts of excess sugar. Professor Rayner was also interviewed in Jamie Oliver’s Sugar Rush Documentary \(2015\) which was viewed by over 1.2M people in the UK. The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver subsequently went on to be a key advocate for a sugary drinks tax in the UK, contributing to the adoption of the tax by the UK Government and public acceptance. Increased general awareness of the health impacts of sugar led to greater public acceptance of a tax on sugary drinks. In 2013 only about 36% of people in the UK supported the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks. By 2015 this had risen to around 58%, but by March 2016, just after the sugary drinks tax had been announced, 69% supported the introduction \[I\]. 

####  C.  Industry responses and product reformulation 

 The SDIL succeeded in prompting widespread product reformulation. All major brands of soft drinks \(including supermarket brands\) launched new sugar\-free versions. This increased access to low\-sugar drinks and allowed consumers to reduce their sugar consumption without compromising their preferences or brand loyalties. In an evaluation of the UK SDIL, the Oxford University researchers demonstrated that the proportion of soft drinks containing >5g/100ml of sugar available on the UK market fell from 49% in 2015 to 15% in 2019 \[J\]. In addition, the majority of new products had a sugar level between 4.5 and 5.0 g per 100 mL, suggesting they the 5.0g threshold of the levy had guided the reformulation. In contrast, drinks exempt from the SDIL \(such as 100% fruit juice and milk\-based drinks\), saw no reduction in average sugar content, reinforcing that the levy was the motivating factor for change \[J\]. 

####  D. Impacts on sugar consumption and health 

 A review by Public Health England \(PHE\) in October 2020 concluded that between 2015 and 2019 in England, there was a 43.7% reduction in the total sugar content per 100ml for retailer and manufacturer branded drinks subject to the SDIL \[K\]. This meant that although sales in all soft drinks increased by 14.9% during this time, the total sugar purchased per household from drinks subject to the SDIL decreased across all socio\-economic groups \(between 38.5% \- 35.1%\). Reduced purchasing of sugar ultimately led to reduced sugar consumption. An analysis conducted by the University of Oxford researchers found that between 2015 and 2018, total sugar consumption from soft drinks declined by 29% despite soft drink consumption rising during this period. Further preliminary results of the evaluation of the levy indicate that compared to the pre\-announcement, the amount of sugar purchased in drinks by a household each week reduced by 29.5g \(9.8%\) one year after the introduction of the levy. The 2017 modelling study \[5\] suggested that the observed reformulation and reduced sugar consumption due to the levy will ultimately result in 140,000 fewer people with obesity and 19,000 fewer incident cases of type 2 diabetes per year in the UK, as well as nearly 270,000 fewer decayed, missing, or filled teeth annually. According to PHE data, the number of 0\-5 year olds being admitted to hospital in England for tooth extractions fell by 20.9% between 2014/15 \(16,591\) and 2018/19 \(13,120\). Between April\-October 2018, the levy raised almost GBP154,000,000 for programmes to support pupil health and well\-being, including primary physical education and the Healthy Pupils Capital Fund. 

 An evaluation of the tax in Mexico \(introduced in 2014\) shows that purchases of taxed beverages fell by 7.6%, between 2014 and 2016 \[L\]. In a modelling study, the Oxford University researchers estimated that this would lead to a projected reduction in new cases of diabetes by 189,300 for the time period 2013 to 2022, amounting to total savings between USD769million to USD1.2billion in direct healthcare costs.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Southampton *Astronomy with US* programme has engaged schools and communities in 117 countries with our research. Through 1,295 innovative activities, we have sparked a fascination in our research in space environment physics and time\-domain astronomy, boosting scientific knowledge and skills in participants from a wide range of ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. Our overarching goal was to *reach communities who have been traditionally less likely to engage with science.  We successfully made astronomy accessible to the visually impaired, to women and girls, at new venues, at designated widening\-participation schools, to home\-educated children, and to communities in Latin America with a low science capital. We have interacted with over 49,000 people face\-to\-face through hands\-on activities and more than 75,000 people online through interactive web activities and podcast downloads. 

 A flagship activity that has flourished through the Covid\-19 pandemic is Aurora Zoo, an online Citizen Science project that has enabled more than 6,118 budding astronomers to analyse thousands of hours of aurora footage from the Arctic, leading to 205,930 classifications of 22,443 aurora images. This led to a research paper which included 5 members of the public as co\-authors. 

 Overall, we have created a more scientifically aware cohort, whose opinions on scientists and appreciation of the importance of research has improved by 55\-75%, while their knowledge of our research topics has increased by 80%. Perhaps most importantly for *us,* more than 80% were inspired to learn more about astronomy with proven enjoyment \(4.25/5\) of our activities.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our academic staff are leading researchers in different areas of time\-domain astrophysics \(Sullivan, Gandhi, Altamirano and Childress\) and space environment physics \(Fear, Whiter and formerly Lanchester\). Our strengths lie in the study of magnetic fields in the solar system, the birth and evolution of the most extreme objects in the universe \(black holes and neutron stars\), and how their progenitors \(supernovae\) can be used to understand the evolution of our Universe. 

 **Public engagement activities related to Space Environment Physics** were inspired by our research on Earth and interplanetary magnetic fields. Paper \[ **3.1**\] explores the relationship between “transpolar arcs”, which are bizarre auroral features known since the early days of Antarctic exploration, and the “cusp spot”, which is aurora formed by direct interaction between the solar wind and magnetosphere. The interaction between the two auroral forms indicates a fundamentally new mode of interaction between the solar wind and magnetosphere. \[ **3.2**\] is the first paper that describes the ASK instrument \(Auroral Structure and Kinetics\) and the science that is possible with it. The ASK instrument is a narrow field auroral imager which observes structure within both auroral forms of the type discussed in \[ **3.1**\]. ASK provides simultaneous images of aurora in 3 different spectral bands at sub\-second resolution. These images provide the data for our Citizen Science project: Aurora Zoo \[ **G3**\]. 

 **Public engagement activities related to Extreme Universe and Dark Energy** were inspired by our research in “time\-domain astronomy”. Paper \[ **3.3**\] shows that rapid optical flux variations from an accreting Galactic black\-hole binary are delayed with respect to X\-rays by about 0.1 seconds \[ **G1**\]. This delayed signal is related to relativistic jet ejections, probing for the first time the “base of the jet”, and suggesting that the jet structure and launching physics could potentially be unified under mass\-invariant models. \[ **3.4**\] answers a lingering question about the evolution of the accretion disk structure around black holes. \[ **3.5**\] reports on the coherent timing analysis of the 182 Hz accreting millisecond X\-ray pulsar, the most accurate natural clocks in the Universe *.* \[ **3.6**\] and \[ **3.7**\] report on detailed studies of supernovae \(SNe Ia\), and how they were used to constrain the origin and evolution of the Universe, and the nature of dark energy \[ **G1**, **G2**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The goal of the *Astronomy with US* \(University of Southampton\) programme is to engage a wide audience with our research, with a particular emphasis on audiences not reached via traditional activities. This required developing new strategies and methods. All our activities are monitored for their effectiveness, reach, and significance via evaluation sheets and analysing feedback and the level of engagement. Coordination of the programme is led by astronomy public engagement leader Dr Sadie Jones and public outreach and engagement leader Dr Pearl John who are both employed by the School of Physics & Astronomy. 

 **4.1 Space Environment Physics Programme** 

 **4.1.1 **Aurora Zoo** \(2019 – present\):  Aurora Zoo is an online Citizen Science project conceived by Lanchester and developed and tested by Whiter. It invites participants to classify data gathered from the Auroral Structure and Kinetics \(ASK\) camera in Svalbard, Norway \[ **3.2**\]. ASK has been operational since 2007 and automatically captures data whenever it is dark; by 2019 it had accumulated thousands of hours of video footage of the aurora, most of which had never been looked at. While “event studies” into specific auroral events had been investigated in detail by the researchers, higher\-level statistical studies on the ASK data were best sourced from *the crowd*. 

 Throughout 2019 and up until Covid\-19 struck, Whiter’s team used a beta version of Aurora Zoo as a face\-to\-face public engagement tool including at the Science Museum’s ‘ *Summer of Space’*, *Glastonbury Festival* and *Light Up Poole\! Digital Arts Festival*. 7,319 aurorae were classified across these events, with the team finding that people of all ages could produce valid and useful data while learning about aurora and enjoying themselves \[ **5.1**\]. Initial results were presented in August 2019 to the research community at a leading astronomy conference in Finland \[ **5.2**\]. 

 In early 2020 a further set of computer\-based \(later virtual\) workshops were run by Jones to introduce pupils up to key stage 5 to Aurora Zoo and demonstrate fieldwork from a January 2020 expedition to Svalbard \[ **5.3**\]. 978 pupils across 9 events were engaged, leading to 6,545 classifications \[ **5.1**\]. 

 The full version of Aurora Zoo was launched online in April 2020 on the popular *Zooniverse* citizen science platform \[ **5.4**\]. One of the key initial findings was the identification of rare *Fragmented Aurora\-like Emission* from footage dating back to 22 December 2014. This led to our first collaborative paper with the 5 citizen scientists involved in the identification \(3 women\). The paper was submitted to ANGEO and published pre\-review in December 2020 \[ **5.5**\]. 

 By 31 December 2020, 6,118 citizen scientists had made 205,930 classifications of 22,443 different aurora images, writing over 1,700 comments in Aurora Zoo public forums. These demonstrated an increased knowledge of aurorae and research skills such as: data interpretation; the importance of knowing the limitations of the instruments; identification of instrumental effects that could lead to misinterpretation of the data, and critical analysis of images. The 5 citizen scientist co\-authors of the paper additionally gained valuable experience of the scientific publishing process. Aurora Zoo also inspired science fiction writer Rosie Oliver to include aurorae in her up\-coming book. \[ **5.1**\] 

 **4.1.2 **Planeterrella** demonstrations \(2017\-2019\):** The Planeterrella is an interactive simulation using plasma and magnetic fields to mimic the interaction between the solar wind and magnetosphere in the formation of aurorae described by Fear \[ **3.1**\]. A team of 8 researchers toured the Planeterrella to 54 local schools, several science and arts festivals \(e.g. *Stargazing Live 2017* and *2018*, *World Science Week 2017* at Winchester Science Centre\) and alternative venues. 

 Over 2017\-2019 the team engaged 4,074 people face\-to\-face: 1,837 pupils and 60 teachers at 54 schools, and 2,177 members of the public at 23 events. Gender balance was a key aim of the programme, with 50% of students and 52% of the public being women or girls. 86% increase in knowledge of aurorae \(compared to 77% for schools\) with 69% showing an increase in their positive opinions about science and science careers \(45% for schools\). 78% of the public had an improved opinion of scientists \(50% for schools\) and 85% had a more positive opinion of the importance of auroral research \(62% for schools\) \[ **5.6**\]. 

 **4.2 Engagement with the Extreme Universe and the Dark Energy Survey \(DES\)** 

 **4.2.1 The **Soton Astrodome** Mobile Planetarium \(2014\-2020\):** The Soton Astrodome is an advanced inflatable planetarium that allows up to 35 people to gain a fully immersive digital experience at any venue with 7x7m of floor space and 3.3m of height. Each 45 minute show includes an introduction by academics to themselves and their research, followed by animated content tailored to the audience. A Q&A session with the researchers concludes the show. 

 From January 2014 to March 2020, 28,571 people were engaged during 1,125 planetarium shows covering black holes \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\], dark energy \[ **3.6**\] and supernovae research \[ **3.7**\]. Of that number, 8,128 were at public venues not usually used for science communication, including *Peppa Pig World* in the New Forest, and *City Art Gallery* and *Sea City Museum* in Southampton. 19,909 pupils and 534 teachers were engaged during 168 school visits to 87 schools. 30% of the schools were designated widening participation \(WP\), defined as those registering at least 17% of pupils entitled to free school meals. \[ **5.7**\] 

 To gauge the significance of the shows for the pupils, 68 year\-5 students from a local primary school fed back what they learned in a planetarium show in July 2019. Overall, 50% of students stated they had learned about aurora; stars and their life cycle; black holes; and/or galaxies **.** 14 Discovery level CREST Awards were earned by local home\-educated students \(aged 4\-13 years\). CREST is a British Science Association scheme to inspire young people and let them think and behave like scientists, with the awards being aligned to the national curriculum and providing a reward system for the students. Our CREST Awards went to those who took part in DES workshops, in total leading the pupils to make 5 films for the planetarium and 11 dark energy “research posters” based on our research \[ **3.6**, **3.7**\] \[ **5.7**\]. 

 The shows also had an impact on teachers. Of 17 primary/secondary school teachers surveyed: 

-  100% rated the shows 10/10 for enjoyment; 

-  77% found the activities to be highly relevant to the school curriculum; 

-  71% said that their astronomy knowledge had increased ‘significantly’. 

 In response to the open\-ended question ‘ *what did you think of the show?*’ teachers responded that we gave them enjoyable, inspiring experiences they would otherwise not have access to, as well as knowledge that they had passed on to their students. \[ **5.7**\] 

 **4.2.2 **Astro\-sonification** for audiences with vision impairments \(2019\):** In collaboration with visually impaired astronomer Dr Wanda Diaz\-Merced \(South Africa\) and Dr Johanna Casado \(Argentina\), Gandhi developed sonification software that enables telescope data streams used in our black hole research \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\] to be turned into sound using a variety of tones, instruments, tempos and notes. In 2019, Gandhi and Casado led a focus group with 4 members of a local visually impaired community organisation, *Southampton Sight*, to improve the software. The group reported an enjoyable experience \(9/10\) which raised their confidence and provided them new research skills \(9/10\): *“Taking part in this activity has really raised my self\-confidence”; “I’ve encouraged other friends who are vision impaired to take part”; “I have learned a lot of new skills.”* All were willing to engage with further projects with Southampton \[ **5.8**\]. One of the participants wrote a *Southampton Sight* guest blog post, concluding that “ *astronomy isn’t the only science with complex data, so I think \[Casado\] may be opening up \[a\] whole new world for us. I hope \[it\] was as useful for her as it was fun for me*. \[ **5.9**\] 

 **4.2.3 **Spanish Speakers’ engagement programme** \(2018\-2020\):** A goal of our programme was to engage with global communities with a lower science capital, for example no regional top\-100 physics departments, where high\-profile astronomy research may not be represented in local outreach activities. Altamirano engaged an international Spanish\-speaking audience, recruited via a social media campaign, with black hole and neutron star research \[ **3.3**\- **3.5**\] in online engagements including remote talks for 345 pupils \(57% girls\) in 5 schools in Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador and Peru, and through podcasts \(57,466 unique downloads from 105 countries, including broadcasts on local radio in Latin\-America\) of research lectures in Spanish \[ **5.10**\]. In response to an online survey of 157 podcast listeners of the neutron star podcast, 99% of those who responded said they had learned something new and 95% indicated that they wanted to learn more by requesting an additional talk on black holes. Translated comments include “ *I realised, within my human brain limitations, of the scales and magnitudes of a neutron star*”; “ *Everything was very interesting, I love to understand what is happening out there. But the most impressive, which seems science fiction to me, is the scientific method*”. Altamirano served as an astronomer role model for Latin American audiences, raising aspirations and confidence in those from marginalised groups: “ *I never thought Latin Americans could become world\-leading scientists.”* \(16\-year\-old pupil from a Peruvian secondary school after the Q&A session\) \[ **5.10**\]. The success of the first podcast was followed by a second together with an online sci\-art competition based on our black hole research. We received 270 artwork entries from 165 amateur artists from 13 different countries. A selection of the artwork was used for a promotional campaign on Facebook that, together with direct interaction, attracted 808,000 unique users to the page, of which around 20,000 actively engaged with the posts \(commenting/sharing with friends or groups\). \[ **5.10**\] 

 **4.2.4** **AstroAirport** \(2016\):** Funded by a STFC PE small award, in February half\-term 2016, a team of four researchers staffed a stand in the departure lounge at Southampton Airport. The stand included demonstrations \(e.g. Hoberman Spheres\) to engage departure lounge passengers with the concept of exploding and collapsing stars \[ **3.5∫**. 1,457 passengers engaged with our research. Of 59 survey respondents: 

-  29% said *“this was the first science event they had ever attended”*; 

-  92% of respondents learned something about our research; 

-  100% could correctly say what a supernova was; 

-  68% rated the engagement as ‘extremely enjoyable’. 

 In a follow\-up form one month later, 78% could recall what they had learned about our research and 89% said they had a more positive opinion of scientists as a result of the interaction \[ **5.11**\]. 

 **4.2.5 **\#SotonAstroArt** \(2017\-2020\):** Our award\-winning Sci\-Art project consists of activities connecting art and science and engaged 15,270 people with our DES/SN research \[ **3.6**\]. Audiences included: 

-  97 emerging artists, invited through social media and artist networks, and their audiences at 14 exhibitions \(>300 people\); 

-  3,708 children and parents at arts workshops in festivals and community spaces \( *Human Worlds Festival* 2017\-2020, *The Photon Shop* 2019\-2020, *Southampton Libraries* 2019\), and 250 who received art activity packs during lockdown \(2020\); 

-  on\-line audiences totalling 11,492 people \(from 47 countries\), including media and social media users, those who downloaded web\-based resources, viewed videos, visited our websites and took part in our art competition; 

-  446 professional astronomy/physics communicators from two conferences \(2018\) \[ **5.12**\]. 

 The impact of the project included an 11% change in perception of artists’ understanding of their position in the Universe with 9% inspired to create new works and an 8% increased understanding of astrophysics concepts \[see testimonials analysed in **5.12**\]. Around 990 artworks were made at 13 family workshops leading to a 25% knowledge increase about supernova among participants. A highlight of the festival engagement was *The Photon Shop* at *Light Up Poole\! Digital Arts Festival*, with an underserved community in a zone of socioeconomic deprivation. From \~2,000 visitors, we obtained feedback from 22 family groups: 75% agreed \(45%\), or strongly agreed \(30%\) that: “ *I am more likely to study Physics or recommend studying Physics to a friend/family member*” as a result of visiting *The Photon Shop*. 95% stated a positive attitude change – they agreed \(43%\), or strongly agreed \(52%\) that *“It inspired me to find out more about Physics”* \[ **5.12**\]. 

 **4.2.6 **Black Hole Talks** for schools and the public \(2014\-2020\):** Over 2014\-2020, Altamirano and Jones, together with other astronomy staff members, delivered talks to 4,117 people \(schools and the public\) on compact objects and black holes, including research methods used in **3.3**, **3.4** and **3.5**. Curriculum\-specific content included multiwavelength astronomy, radio interferometry and the importance of resolution. 

 534 evaluations were collected from 57 of the events at schools. Students reported a mean enjoyment of 4.1/5 and a 17% increase in their interest in black hole research. In addition, when asked to rate the amount that they had learned during the talk, 71% of GCSE students and 91% of A\-level students surveyed increased their knowledge, and 77% of A\-level students stated they were likely to do further reading on Black Hole research following the talk. Analysis of 730 evaluations from 16 public events led to similar results, with a mean enjoyment of 4.7/5, 31% increase of interest, and self\-evaluation of learning of 4.1/5. 

 Overall, 59% of A\-level students and 40% of the public displayed an advanced understanding of black hole concepts, such as the existence of astrophysical jets, and research\-specific topics including how astrophysical jets are studied. \[ **5.13**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Climate change is a complex issue for society to understand and, as a consequence, to respond to. If society is to avoid breaching the internationally agreed limits to climate change, more informed debate is required about the timing and scale of transformative changes required to policy and lifestyles. Engagement and dialogue are key to triggering the widespread everyday conversations that are needed to lead to this more informed debate.  At the heart of this problem has been the lack of a simple means of emphatically conveying that significant and recent climate change is underway and will affect individuals, and particularly to do so in a way that does not need arguments or information that require scientific literacy. This case study describes the use of research that has inspired and achieved mass public communication and engagement using specifically designed simple visualisations about how the climate has changed. More specifically, research at Reading has examined the importance of how changes in global temperature are estimated and defined, and how those changes are experienced at the local level. This has improved understanding and communication of historical temperature changes and resulted in the development of the Climate Spiral and the Warming Stripes. These two visualisations have reached millions, becoming iconic representations of concern for climate change and now widely recognised around the world. Underpinned by the best available quantitative climate observations and research, they have been effective in raising awareness at scale, starting conversations that may lead to solutions.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2006, Hawkins has published a wide body of highly\-cited research dealing with climate change detection and quantification. This has been complemented by very active and enthusiastic communication and engagement campaigns in which Hawkins has looked for new ways of explaining the extent of recent climate change to wider audiences. This engagement has been through presentations, social media platforms, for example Twitter, his  [*Climate Lab Book*](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/) blog and other online publications such as  [*The Conversation*](https://theconversation.com/profiles/ed-hawkins-104793). Learning from these experiences has led Hawkins to increasingly focus on developing climate change visualisations as a means of effective engagement at scale. This visualisation work requires the statistical robustness of temperature records, baselines, signal detection, and attribution, which has been a focus of Hawkins’ fundamental research. 

 On the statistical robustness of the global temperature record, in \[R1\] Hawkins analysed the warming ‘hiatus’ \(which had been widely discussed and debated between 2000 and 2010\), in terms of how inter\-annual and decadal variations in climate can temporarily mask or enhance the changes caused by humans, and how the observations were consistent with model simulations for the same period when the variations were accounted for. In \[R2\], Hawkins showed that observational warming records and climate model simulations could be even more closely reconciled by accounting for the geographic bias in observational records to places where the warming is naturally slower. 

 When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\) 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit global temperature rise to “well below 2°C above pre\-industrial levels”, Hawkins noted that it did not specifically define the meaning of ‘pre\-industrial’ or discuss the sensitivities to the choice of a pre\-industrial baseline which leads to ambiguity in the meaning of the temperature limits. Around this time Hawkins started experimenting with visualisations of climate change, leading to the development of the Climate Spiral, a dynamic animated graphic which grows from the 1850 to 1900 average towards the present day, matching the *Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) 2013 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report* \(AR5\), which used 1850 to 1900 from which to measure changes in temperature. A commentary of how the Climate Spiral was developed and used  was  [published](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0228.1), building on Hawkins’ research into how global temperatures have changed over time. The culmination of the research into defining the meaning of ‘pre\-industrial’ separately from a ‘temperature change baseline’, appeared in \[R3\], a paper led by Hawkins with an international group of co\-authors. This provided a detailed examination of possible definitions of ‘pre\-industrial periods’, recommending 1720 to 1800 as a more justifiable choice; it also recommended that temperature targets, such as those specified in Paris, be defined around more recent, better observed, ‘temperature baseline’ time periods. 

 
In May 2018, Hawkins was invited to speak to a broad audience about climate change at the Hay\-on\-Wye Literary Festival. Hawkins wanted to create a simpler visualisation focused on regional climate change and developed the ‘Warming Stripes’ for the town of Hay, showing how temperatures had changed there in the previous 100 years \(Figure 2\). The Warming Stripes are a series of vertical stripes, one for each year, coloured by the average temperature in that year \(blue = colder, red = hotter\). Figure 3 depicts the annual changes in global temperature from 1850 to 2019, with change from mainly blue \(colder\) to mainly red \(warmer\) through time, with much less interannual variability than the local Hay stripes, showing a compelling and simple story about recent warming temperatures. 

 **Figure 1**: Spiral shows the average global temperature for each month, from 1850 to 2020, relative to the 1850 to 1900 baseline period, shown as a white inner circle. As the viewer moves outwards from the baseline circle \(0°C\), the temperature increases. See:*  [*http://www.climate\-lab\-book.ac.uk/spirals/*](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/spirals/) 

 
**Figure 2:** Warming stripes for the town of Hay from 1884 to 2017, as shown at the Festival 2018.* 



 **Figure 3**: Global annual temperature warming stripes from 1850 to 2019.* 

 Hawkins quickly realised that to make this image more useful and comparable for different regions, a signal\-to\-noise scaling was needed \(dividing the temperature anomaly in each year by the amplitude of the natural variability in the region\). This allows the very different temperature variations found in different regions to be displayed with the same colour scale. These scaling  ideas were first developed in \[R4\] for determining the robustness of climate change signals in different model simulations, and were subsequently used in  [IPCC AR5 Chapter 11](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter11_FINAL.pdf) “ *Near\-term Climate Change: Projections and Predictability*. *”* In \[R5\], these scaling ideas were extended to determine the relationships between global and regional temperature change signals. 

 These insights were key to enabling the creation of a worldwide array of regional Warming Stripes using a consistent algorithm, allowing their launch on the *\#ShowYourStripes* website \( [www.showyourstripes.info](http://www.showyourstripes.info/)\). This allows anyone from around the world to find and freely download their country’s Warming Stripes to see how their temperatures have changed. Users can also download the global changes, or changes in other regions, inviting greater appreciation of how change is occurring. The regional climate stripes visual comparisons also stimulated Hawkins’ further research, leading to \[R6\], that highlights in which regions, and for which climate indicators, the effects of climate change can already be confidently claimed. 

 This visualisation work has therefore drawn on, and sometimes stimulated, Hawkins fundamental research related to statistical robustness of temperature records, baselines, signal detection, and change attribution through modelling.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Climate Spiral and the Warming Stripes have become iconic representations of concern for climate change, widely recognised around the world. Underpinned by science, and freely available to download, they have been effective in raising awareness at scale and inspiring creative proliferation in surprising ways. They remind people, including policymakers, of the recent abrupt warming, while also containing scientific content and being adaptable to highlight specific regional concerns. 

 **The Climate Spiral:** In May 2016, Hawkins posted the Climate Spiral \(see Figure 1\) on his Twitter account \(@ed\_hawkins\) and it ‘went viral’ – reaching more than 4 million people and stimulating dialogue about the effects of climate change \[S1\(i\)\]. On 6 August 2016, the opening ceremony of the Rio Olympics was watched by over 1bn people. The ceremony included a segment on climate change \[S1\(ii\)\] and featured an animated spiral graphic representation of rising global temperatures. Paulo Artaxo, the science advisor to the Rio ceremony, confirmed that the animation used in the ceremony was a redrawn version of Reading’s original design \[S1\(iii\)\]. In addition to the Olympics, policymakers in the UK and overseas have also engaged with the Climate Spiral. For example, the graphic description was presented in Spanish \[S2\], and other languages, by ShareAmerica, the U.S. Department of State’s platform for communicating American foreign policy worldwide. 

 **The Warming Stripes**: Following the success of the animated spiral, Hawkins designed the Warming Stripes to be as simple as possible, to start conversations about our warming world and the risks of climate change with the widest audience, on social media and beyond, without the pre\-requisite of scientific knowledge. Engagement with the Warming Stripes began at the Hay Festival but swiftly moved into social media, television and print media, physical objects, and politics. 

 In May 2018, after Hay, Hawkins launched the Warming Stripes on social media and their publicity began to spread through mainstream media. The results were extensive and creative. The Warming Stripes were picked up by the BBC and used on programmes such as *Weather World* and *Click*, and by ITV on the *Evening News* \[S3\] as an illustration of climate change. Television weather forecasters around the world launched their own campaign based on the Warming Stripes, entitled *\#MetsUnite* \(started by meteorologist Jeff Berardelli in Florida, USA who was inspired by the compelling data visualisation\). On 21 June \(the summer solstice\) in 2018 and 2019, and 18 June 2020, the now annual \# *MetsUnite* campaign has resulted in live broadcast coverage of the Warming Stripes by up to 120 TV weather forecasters in 30 countries, with ensuing discussions about climate change on air. Many forecasters wore Warming\-Stripe\-patterned clothing such as ties, scarves or earrings. Posts from the 2018 event can be found on the AGU blog and in ecointerviews.com \[S4\]. 

  

 In Spring 2019, the international movement *School Strikes for Climate* started to proliferate globally, and Hawkins decided to support it by making the Warming Stripes widely available at a regional level. Thus, in May 2019, the University of Reading Department of Meteorology collaborated with the Institute of Environmental Analytics \(also based at the University of Reading\) and launched the \# *ShowYourStripes* campaign. The Warming Stripes became  [public and freely available](http://www.showyourstripes.info/), with at least one set of Stripes created for every country around the world; this allowed anyone to see and further communicate how climate is warming in their region. In the first week of the \# *ShowYourStripes* initiative, there were 1 million downloads from 180,000 unique visitors in over 150 different countries. The campaign asked people to adopt the Warming Stripes for their social media profiles and share the graphics for their own country, enabling anyone to join the conversation. The \#ShowYourStripes website was still receiving approximately 20,000 unique visitors and downloads per month in December 2020. 

  

 In Summer 2019, rock band *Enter Shikari* used the Warming Stripes as a backdrop during their music tour gigs, including at Reading and Leeds Festivals, prominently displaying the graphic to tens of thousands of music fans \[S5\]. The lead singer discussed the meaning of the Warming Stripes on stage during each performance, providing a new and non\-traditional forum for engagement about the realities of climate change. As a result, a full A4 print of the Warming Stripes was included in *Kerrang*, a leading UK rock music magazine with international distribution. More magazine and newspaper articles followed \[S6\]. 

 In September 2019 *The Economist* magazine used the Warming Stripes as the front cover of their ‘Climate Issue’ which reached 1.5 million readers. Several national newspapers subsequently used the Warming Stripes on their front pages, extending its reach to millions more, including: *The Guardian* \(UK\) \(readership: 35.6 million per month\), *FAZ* \(Germany; 830,000 readers per issue in 2019\), *Wiener Zeitung* \(Austria; readership 61,000 per week in 2020\), *Internazionale* \(Italy\), *Publico* \(Portugal; 7,592,279 unique online visitors each month\), *Folha* \(Brazil; monthly readership: 328,438\) and *Helsingin Sanomat* \(Finland; 2019 readership 339,437\). Other online articles discussing the graphics have since appeared in *Design Week* \(readership: 11,000 per week\), *Washington Post*, *Vox*, *Fast Company* \(circulation: 757,858, June 2012\) and *Forbes* \(readership: 140 million per month\). A montage of most of the print media front pages can be seen in the Climate Stripes Scrapbook \[S6\]. 

 Hawkins’ warming visualisations have also been widely adopted in government and by politicians. The Met Office now use both the Spiral and Stripes graphics in their *What is Climate Change?* webpage \[S7\]. The Warming Stripes were used as a prominent backdrop, as well as appearing in individual exhibits, at the 25<sup>th</sup> UNFCCC Conference of the Parties \(COP25\) event in Madrid in December 2019. During the February 2020 US State of the Union address, several Senators and Representatives wore badges with the Warming Stripes to show their support for more action on climate change \[S8\]. The US House Committee on the Climate Crisis also adopted the Warming Stripes as part of their logo for the 2020 session of Congress, crediting the University of Reading \[S9\]. All of the aforementioned images/logos can be found in the Climate Stripes Scrapbook \[S6\]. 

 Many different creative and innovate uses for the Warming Stripes continue to appear, keeping climate change in the public eye. For example, the graphics have been painted on a tram in Freiburg \(Germany\) and on a Tesla car \(Minnesota, USA\), recreated out of stained glass, painted on walls in Spain, New York and Jersey, and used during light shows in Denmark and Berlin. Various groups of knitters, including the Women’s Institute have also recreated them, and many commercially available products such as dresses, t\-shirts, neck buffs and face masks incorporate the graphics. Protest groups at the recent global climate strikes in multiple locations from Oxford to The Hague, and from Nigeria to Kuala Lumpur have used them, and museums have adopted the graphics to educate the public. Many of these uses are also captured in the Climate Stripes Scrapbook \[S6\]. 

 The Climate Spiral was shortlisted for data insight and consulting company Kantar’s *Information is Beautiful* award in 2016. The Climate Stripes won the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam’s *Vis for Future* award in 2019, as reported by ITV, and was runner up in *The* *Guardian’*s Marketing and Communications Campaign Awards 2020. In January 2020, Hawkins was awarded an MBE for services to climate science and science communication in the New Year’s honours list \[S10\]. 

 **Summary:** Engagement and dialogue are key to initiating the everyday conversations about climate change which lead on to demand for more informed debate and action. Hawkins’ graphics have been tremendously successful in promoting these conversations and debates on a worldwide scale. By intentionally making the graphics free and easy to download, use, adapt and personalise, Hawkins has removed barriers to their adoption by the public. Consequently, they have been used by a diverse public audience across the globe– from those who are not used to seeing scientific graphics, to non\-governmental organisations, and from TV weather presenters to artists. The simplicity of the graphics has enabled their use in many different ways, starting conversations amongst groups who may not normally talk about climate change. The Climate Spiral and Warming Stripes have now found a place in the global public imagination and in doing so have become important symbols to engage the wider population in discussions about climate change and society’s response to it.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Allan Owens’ work focuses on the use of Pretext Drama in formal and non\-formal educational settings. His work has informed curriculum content, teaching delivery and educational practices in Catalonia, Finland, Palestine, and Japan. Some have been in extremely challenging contexts, such as with returning evacuated Fukushima Daichi nuclear disaster Tsunami survivors in Japan; and in Palestine with educators from the University of Bethlehem and Alrowwad Cultural and Arts Society, Aida Refugee Camp, on the concept of non\-violent resistance to the ongoing military occupation. 

 Through Pretext Drama, Owens has equipped educators, artists, and students with drama\-enriched skills to create ‘third spaces’ for understanding that has led to new democratic and culturally\-shared perspectives on homeland, inclusion, sustainable development, urban environments, business practices, and in the case of Palestine, practices of non\-violent, beautiful resistance.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research is the key publication of a co\-authored research monograph, *Creativity and Democracy in Education: practices and politics of learning through the arts*, 2015 \[3:1\]. The book conceptualised the term ‘critical creativity’. Following on from this publication, several practice\-led research projects were instigated in four principal countries in the period 2014\-2020. This was a continuation of an impact case study examining process drama in the professions \(Owens, REF2014\). The research was led by Owens in collaboration with scholars and practitioners from around the world. The research was supported with grants from the British Academy, the British Council and Erasmus \+ Key Action 2 \(among others\). 

 **2.1 Research Findings.** Pretext Drama is a deceptively simple dramaturgical structure that provides the opportunity for participants to reflect critically and collectively in the midst of creative action, on the assumptions and connection they make to a given subject or phenomenon. Following on from Boal’s articulation of the Oneiric Dimension, Owens’ research has shown that through the ‘drama’, an imagined world is created by its participants enabling discussion as it evolves. The aesthetic distance generated through the movement between the reality of the drama and the reality of daily life creates a ‘third space’ of learning possibilities as understanding shifts. The third space created through Pretext Drama is safe, but dissensual; there is no attempt to reach consensus, but rather to allow diverse voices to compete and, in doing so, to allow opportunities for democratic and culturally\-shared perspectives to emerge. 

 **2.2 Research Process.** This impact case study resulted in, and built from, several publications, which have been informed through research\-led drama practice. The key underpinning publication \[3.1\] conceptualised the term ‘critical creativity’. The term privileges polyphony and dissensus in dialogue; participation and engagement is key: resolution is not the aim. The case is made that critical creativity is a necessary part of any process or organisation that values critical understanding and learning if it is to form part of a functioning democracy \[3:1\]. 

 Through practice\-led research \(with colleagues in Finland and the UK\), Owens set about theorising this further. He secured Erasmus\+ Key Action 2 funding for a research project that brought collaborators together for a project called *Beyond Text*, anarts\-based approach to research assessment and evaluation, designed to articulate alternatives to instrumental approaches to knowledge. 

 Owens’ work on the *Beyond Text* project led to an invitation from the Business School, University of Jyväskylä, Finland, to reconfigure the ‘Introduction to Leadership’ International Annual Summer School course \(2017\-2018\). The implications of embedding Pretext Drama within an introductory course to leadership \[3:2\]. 

 The question then arose as to why arts\-based research as pretexts for innovation in organisations are not more widely used. This led to a further publication, which highlighted the reasoning behind the use of arts\-based methods to foster criticality and to question assumptions informing daily, localised management and organisational practices \[3:3\]. 

 Owens also initiated an international research project with teacher educators in Finland and five other partner universities in Austria, Estonia, Germany, Spain, and Sweden \(2014\-2017\). The research project was called *Inside out / Outside in \- Building bridges in teacher education through encounters with diversity*, and explored the use of critical creativity in pretext form in pre\- and in\-service teacher education. This led to two peer\-reviewed research outputs \[3:4\]; \[3:5\]. 

 Research undertaken with educators and collaborators in Catalonia, Finland, Estonia, and Palestine led to a E\-Publication of the *Beyond Text* project \(2020\), in open access and translated into 5 languages: Arabic, Catalan, Estonian, Finnish and Spanish. \[3.6\]

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impacts of Owens’ research are detailed by country, and evidenced in three interrelated ways. Firstly, this section will show the impact of Pretext Drama on curriculum content and teaching delivery, and the corollary benefits for organisations, students, teachers, and drama practitioners. Secondly, Owens’ development of third spaces to promote democratic and culturally\-shared understanding has a significance beyond academia and particularly in challenging contexts, such as those experienced by tsunami nuclear disaster survivors, and those living in occupied territories. Thirdly, this case study has enabled Owens to build on collaborative research established in the previous REF cycle in new and dynamic ways. 

 **Japan.** Between 2016\-18, Pretexts were created for the Minamisoma Tsunami Disaster Committee \(Fukushima Prefecture, Japan\), in collaboration with Taichi\-Kikaku Theatre, Tokyo. These were: \(1\) *Izanami and Izanagi*, 2016; \(2\) *Three Turtles*, 2017; and \(3\) *Kabutomushi*, 2018. Through Drama Pretext, third spaces were created in Odaka City – an area compulsorily evacuated after the tsunami nuclear disaster and slowly being repopulated. 109 local residents \(a group of which had established a disaster committee\) were equipped with pretext drama skills, which benefited the disaster committee members by giving them an alternative way of engaging with the community in a safe third space about their daily lives: “ *\[Owens\] supported reconstruction of our community. The Pretexts Izanami and Izanagi, Three Turtles, Kabutomushi, brought us together. We gathered before and after them, could talk and think together, we could dream together. It was a new way we could learn to be together in a special way in the ketsu \(Evacuee Camp\), in the town hall, people could hear our stories through other stories. This is a long process, and the pretexts are part of that. Memories that help carry us forward.*” \(Mikako Takahashi\). \[5:1\] 

 Pretext drama was embedded in the introductory week for all first\- and second\-year students of the Voice Actor Program, Tokyo University of Technology, Kogakuin, Tokyo \(2016\-19\). 12 staff have learned the skills to use pretexts to create third spaces. This has directly benefited 810 students by enabling them to interact with each other in third spaces in ways not possible in their traditional Japanese voice\-actor training program. This facilitated a cultural shift from the traditional master/mentor conservatoire model and led to a greater sense of inclusion and belonging from the very beginning of their course. Tomoko Yoshimura refers to the impact on students:“ *The first week for the voice actor students \(250 plus each year cohort\) had pretext drama as the starting point for students to gain confidence by interacting with each other in a very different way than in their regular classes. There was a big move from sensi teaching to make sure everyone was included so they could create with their fellow students but within the structure of the pretext, providing safety.*” \(Tomoko Yoshimura\). \[5:2\] 

 The Japan Association of Theatre for Children and Young People \(2015\-19\) has established pretext drama as an annual input in their program, benefiting 83 practitioners from across Japan by equipping them with skills to create their own third spaces for understanding through pretext. “ *Owens’…pretext based applied drama method and his practice has opened new possibility of Japanese drama education.*” \(Katsunari Morito\). \[5:3\] 

 **Finland.** Owens’ research in Pretext Drama has significantly impacted on the theory and practice of Finnish drama education during this and the previous REF cycle. Owens’ work in Finland has enabled fellow practitioners, municipal organisations, and students and academics in a range of disciplines to engage with each other and the public in creating spaces of understanding for explorations of sustainability, biodiversity, and indigenous cultures. In a 2018 interview, Petäjäjärvi stated that Owens “ *represent\[s\] a guru in taking \[pretext drama methods\] into different groups, societies, different spaces outside the theatre.”* \[5:4\] 

 *The Inner Elf: Living Tale of Lapland Pretext* \(2015\) was created for the Laplandic Spiritual Adventure Park Company Hullu Poro Oy, Levi, and has been embedded in park locations and characters. Pretext equipped company managers and workers to make explicit their implicit local knowledge of Sami culture for the visitor experience. 2,000 visitors from across Europe and Asia \(2015\-2019\) have benefited by being introduced to the spiritual values of the Sami culture through the spaces created. \[5.5\] 

 *The Three Professors Pretext* \(2018\) was created for Lahti City Municipal Authority. QR coded ‘StoryPark’ plates were installed in Lanu Park, Lahti, for public use. 230 members of the public, the majority being children and young people have scanned the codes on their phones to take part in the pretext. Through the story, presented in a series of audio files, they meet three professors from outer space who lead them to places in the park and invite them in to exercises which make them curious and increase their understanding of the biodiversity of the park. This resulted in a greater appreciation of the park, thus enhancing civic engagement at a local level:“ *Owens’ pretext work has been central to the social innovative core of projects such as The Three Professors… between LUT University and Lahti City Municipal Authority. ‘StoryPark’ plates are in situ and now lead park users to sites increasing their knowledge of and interest in the biodiversity of Lanu Park.*” \(Anne Pässilä\). \[5.6\] 

 Public Open Space Landscape Design \(2020\) is a pretext based final year module created for the Landscape Design and Construction Degree Program with the Bachelor of Natural Resources Degree at Häme University of Applied Sciences. 47 third year students benefited through learning new arts\-based planning and design skills for sustainable development in future urban environments:“ *In Autumn 2020 a Public Open Space Design module in the Landscape Design and Construction Degree Program were implemented on the base of Beyond Text. This implementation supported transformative learning and growth of professional skills and produced 40 x 7ECTS= 280 ECTS.*” \(Sari Suomalainen\). \[5.7\] 

 The *Swim Eye* \(2016\) Pretext and concept of critical were embedded in the ‘Outside\-In \-Inside Out; Encounters with Cultural Diversity three\-year project run at the University of Jyväskylä. 96 students and 18 academic staff benefited by learning the skills needed to create third spaces for intercultural dialogue through pretext. 

 The Kaleidoscopic Pedagogy Pretext approach was embedded in the University of Jyväskylä’s Business Faculty to reconfigure the ‘Introduction to Leadership’ International Annual Summer School course \(2017 & 2018\) by leading through pretext and creative pedagogical practices. 46 students from 12 countries benefited by broadening their understandings of leadership and management to reconfigure the relationship between the intuitive and rational. This was part of a cultural challenge to traditional business school training. 

 Again, Owens’ impact benefits participants directly and, in their capacity as educators or practitioners in various fields, equips them for wide\-reaching, significant, and sustainable impacts beyond the period covered in this case study. 

 **Catalonia, Spain.** *La Nave Va Theatre Company* have embedded Owens’ theory and practice in their work since 2015 to the benefit of children and teachers in 240 primary schools in Catalonia. Their pretext project, *Three Friends*/ *Los\-Tres\-Amigios* \(2015\), has benefited 650 children aged 9\-11 by allowing them to engage with issues of difference in a safe third space. As a result, *La Nave Va* now equip other artists in Catalonia to create spaces for understanding. For example, The *Beyond Text Multiplier Day Event* \(led by Owens\), at Fabra i Coats Arts Factory \(February 2018\), enabled 72 experienced educators and artists from across Catalonia to expand their understanding of Pretext Drama and to re\-frame critical creativity for use in their own practice:“ *We now use pretext drama in many projects to raise consciousness of issues that are difficult to address directly... this has involved us training other members of the company on the skills needed. Beyond Text project allowed us to develop our arts\-based research strand of pretext and other work alongside the other forms we use.*” \(David Martinez\). \[5:8\] 

 Similarly, the Universitat de Vic \(Universitat Central de Catalunya\) now has a regional reputation in pretext arts\-based research, evaluation, and practice; for example, they have been commissioned to evaluate the Catalonia Community Arts Festival \(Spring 2021\). 68 youth\-work students at Vic now use the *Beyond Text* ebook \(Catalan Translation\), which has benefited them in broadening their repertoire of skills for youth engagement. In the North of Catalonia, 230 second\-year students on the University of Girona Primary Teachers Programme have also benefited through gaining skills and theoretical understanding of critical and democratic creativity in pretext form to enrich their work with young people aged 7\-12. 

 **Palestine.** Building upon Owens’ collaborations in the previous REF cycle, the MA Creative Pedagogies and Community Practices at the University of Bethlehem \(Palestinian Ministry of Education approval 2021\) is the first MA in the West Bank in which Palestinian educators, artists, and community workers study through radical pedagogical approaches such as pretext drama. Dean of Education Al Yamani based this programme on research\-led practice with Owens from the period 2014\-2020, which has benefited 185 teacher education students, and serving teachers who can now use arts\-based practices:“ *This experience has enabled us to work at the University of Bethlehem with students and teachers in participative engaging ways that challenge the traditional teaching and learning approach. This new approach is at the heart of the MA in Creative Pedagogies and Community Practices that we have submitted to the Ministry of Higher Education.*” \(Hala Rashed Al\-Yamani\). \[5:9\] 

 The Centre for Excellence in Learning and Teaching \(CETL\) at Bethlehem University runs courses for academics in creative critical pedagogy. These have benefited 41 staff across the faculties by equipping then with the ability to use Pretexts as a form of Arts\-Based Research, and to employ new methods of data collection and dissemination. This influence on teachers’ critical research practice amplifies the reach and sustainability of Owens’ impact: “ *During my tenure at CETL, I have held workshops relating to Beyond Text, where staff started exploring ideas, methods to incorporate in their courses.*” \(Hala Nassar\). \[5:10\] 

 Two Palestinian academics from West Bank \(Alsawayfa\) and Gaza \(El Waheidi\) obtained their doctorates \(2015\-2019\) with Owens as Supervisor, and have broadened the range of research methodologies and methods available to students. As a direct result of this, in 2019\-2020, 120 Palestinian early years’ teachers have used methods for the benefit of their pupils in state schools using the Beyond Text E\-Book Arabic translation:“ *Since returning to Palestine I have been using drama education in my practice with teacher education students in the university and out in school classrooms as an active form of learning, as a radical alternative to teaching that encourages passivity and reproduction of existing knowledge*” \(Fadel Jobran Alsawayfa\). \[5:11\] 

 Since Owens’ impact in the previous REF cycle, Alrowwad Theatre and Culture Centre, Aida Refugee Camp, is now using Pretext Drama and other arts\-based research methods to represent key strands of their work. The first of these was the framing ‘Life in the Camp’ theatre production as ethnographic performance \(2018\) – a form of non\-violent, beautiful resistance to military occupation of the West Bank.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Import tariffs in Argentina are amongst the highest in the world. Barely changed since 1995, they have prevented the country benefitting from globalisation. Building on insights and methods from his research, Dr Juan Carluccio developed a proposal for import\-tariff reform that impacted policy\-making in Argentina through three channels: 1\) negotiations to revise the Common External Tariff \(CET\) of MERCOSUR, a trading bloc composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, resulting in savings of £100m per year for firms, 2\) unilateral tariff reductions producing savings of over £50m per year, and 3\) negotiations of trade agreements between the EU and MERCOSUR leading to one of the world’s biggest free trade areas. These key components of the country’s “intelligent integration” strategy impacted all firms, consumers and workers in Argentina and MERCOSUR. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2013, Carluccio’s research at the University of Surrey has focused on understanding how imports affect firms, workers and consumers. His research offers new theoretical insights and novel empirical measures utilising large datasets of imports, exports, firm production and wages. 

 Throughout the rest of the narrative, the terms “inputs” and “intermediate goods” will be used interchangeably to denote goods used in the production process of other goods, as opposed to final consumption. As an example, steel and iron are intermediate goods for the production of cars, with cars being final consumption products. 

 Reducing trade barriers makes imported goods cheaper, benefitting both firms and consumers. 

###  Intermediate goods imports increase firm productivity, wages, and demand for skilled workers 

 Carluccio analysed firms’ decisions to import intermediate goods and their impacts on productivity and employment. Firms react to reductions in trade barriers by moving the most unskilled intensive parts of the production process \(e.g., assembly lines\) to low\-wage countries, and concentrate their activities on tasks undertaken by skilled workers, such as marketing and product design. Consequently, productivity of importing firms increases, and their employment becomes more biased towards skilled workers. A key insight of the research is that the impact of tariff reductions is felt primarily by the largest firms because only larger firms can afford offshoring costs, such as searching for suppliers in foreign countries **\[3.1\]**. Carluccio’s work includes original empirical measures of the importance of unskilled labour in the production of imported products \(“labour\-intensity”\). 

 Offshoring affects wages. Carluccio’s work showed that increases in firms’ imports of intermediate goods are associated with higher average wages, consistent with the theoretical idea that offshoring raises firm productivity. However, productivity and wage gains accrue solely to skilled workers, such as technicians and executives, and have nil effects on blue\-collar workers who are more easily substituted for foreign labour **\[3.2\]**. 

 Carluccio studied the wage consequences of the integration of emerging economies \(such as China\) into global value chains, which manifest themselves as imports of intermediate goods into high\- and middle\-income economies. The research showed that such integration increases wages of emerging\-economy workers while generating wage inequalities in importing developed economies, raising skilled workers’ wages, but decreasing those of unskilled workers, in line with evidence discussed above **\[3.2 and 3.3\]**. 

 Furthermore, institutions in a host country affect offshoring strategies. Carluccio shows, both theoretically and empirically, that when firms import from countries where worker bargaining power is strong, they prefer to subcontract to independent suppliers \(“outsourcing”\) instead of building their own factories, with consequences for wages and productivity **\[3.4\]**. 

###  Imports of consumer goods reduces the cost of living for local consumers 

 Reduction in consumer prices are the other side of the globalisation ‘coin’. Carluccio provided one of the first quantifications of the impact of imports on consumer prices, developing an original methodology and applying it to detailed data on imports by product and country of origin **\[3.5\]**. 

###  Research on economic policy\-making in Argentina 

 As well as analysing the European experience, Carluccio studied trade policies in Argentina and discussed the effect of the strongly protectionist measures undertaken during 2011\-2015 on the performance of the economy **\[3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Achieving “intelligent insertion into the world” was a key objective of Argentina’s government during Mauricio Macri’s Presidency \(December 2015 – December 2019\) **\[5.1a\]**, which took office after over a decade of economic isolation **\[3.6\]**. At the heart of this objective was import\-tariff reform to allow local firms’ participation in global value chains and to reap the opportunities provided by globaliszed production **\[5.1b\]**. 

 Carluccio worked in Argentina from April 2018 to April 2019 as Director of Research with the National Foreign Trade Commission \- *Comision Nacional de Comercio Exterior*, \(CNCE\), alongside local economists, transferring knowledge and capabilities gathered during his extensive experience as an academic. His research conducted at the University of Surrey was decisive in the decision by the Ministry of Production and Labour of Argentina to appoint him **\[5.2a\]** and charge him with developing a proposal for a thorough reform of import tariffs. The President of the CNCE stated “ *I proposed the authorities that Juan Carluccio join our research unit under the belief that the state\-of\-the art ideas developed in his academic works would materialize in sound applied research with strong impact in the decision\-making process”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 Argentina is part of MERCOSUR, a trading bloc where Common External Tariffs \(CET\) apply to goods imported from third countries. MERCOSUR tariffs had remained unchanged since 1995 and were amongst the world’s highest **\[5.4\]**. Reforming the CET required consensus by all members. Individual countries are allowed to unilaterally change tariffs of a limited set of products \(100 in the case of Argentina\) via the ‘Lists of Exceptions to the CET’. 

 The decision process for tariff changes in the Ministry for Production and Labour of Argentina is composed of three steps. In a first step, technical teams within the International Trade Secretariat provide recommendations based on economic and data analysis. These proposals are then presented to high\-rank officials, and eventually to the Secretary and Minister who make the final decisions **\[5.3\]**. In the case of unilateral decisions, the process requires a Decree implementing the changes. In the case of MERCOSUR’s common tariffs, Argentine representatives propose changes to the bloc’s members and, if consensus is reached, changes are made effective through MERCOSUR Resolutions. 

###  Establishing the foundations for tariff reforms 

 Carluccio first developed a study of the tariff structure of Argentina and MERCOSUR, drawing on his research **\[3.1\-3.6\]**. The study, consolidated in an official government White Paper **\[5.4\]**, contains a general diagnosis and priorities to guide reform. Products were grouped according to their position in the value chain, following concepts and data\-analysis methods developed by Carluccio **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.5\]**. Tariffs were compared to international standards, and the implications of the tariffs for productivity and competitiveness were explained. High tariffs for intermediate goods are highlighted as particularly harmful because these goods represent a large share of production costs **\[3.1\]**. 

 The diagnosis highlighted the abnormally high levels of tariffs in Argentina \(four times higher than international averages\), and identified high tariffs applied to intermediate goods as the key deficiency of the tariff structure. Importantly, the White Paper **\[5.4\]**, stresses that high input tariffs hinder the expected beneficial effects of free\-trade agreements, thus emphasising the need for a coherent approach to trade openness **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.5\]**. 

 The diagnosis and policy recommendations from Carluccio’s White Paper garnered consensus amongst senior officers following presentations to the Minister of Production and Labour and various State Secretaries, Under\-secretaries and mid\-rank officials with policy\-making influence. The Trade Under\-secretary stated: “ *The messages of this research gathered consensus among senior policy\-makers and were influential in highlighting the need to modernise the structure of tariff protection in MERCOSUR, as well as the priorities that should guide the reforms*” **\[5.5\]**. The Economic Policy Secretary stated in March 2019 that Carluccio’s work “ *is currently gaining consensus within our administration, evidenced by the fact that he presented his recommendations to me on behalf of the Secretary of International Trade in my capacity of Secretary of Economic Policy*” **\[5.6\]**. 

###  Impact on tariff change decisions by Argentina’s and MERCOSUR’s authorities 

 Impacting policy\-making in Argentina through three channels: 

### 1.  Revision of MERCOSUR’s Common External Tariff \(CET\). 

 Senior officers’ consensus around the diagnoses and recommendations resulted in Carluccio being tasked with elaborating a detailed tariff\-reform proposal for around 10,000 products in the MERCOSUR product classification \(NCM\), by directing a team of specialists in different sectors of the economy. This work impacted the decision\-making process in two instances. In late 2018, it led to the decision by MERCOSUR to reduce tariffs for 49 inputs used in the chemicals sector **\[5.1d, 5.8b\]**. The average tariff for these goods was reduced from 10% to 2%, implying estimated yearly savings of over £100m in tariff costs for firms in the industry **\[5.11a\]**. In early 2019 a cross\-country expert group with Member States representatives was instructed to study and revise the CET under the conviction that it is “ *fundamental for the consolidation of the Customs Union*” and that the tariff structure has to “ *promote competitiveness and productivity in the region*” **\[5.1c\]**, **\[5.7a**, **5.7b**, **5.7c**, **5.7d**, **5.8a\]**. The proposals from Carluccio and his team represented the position of Argentina in the negotiations. The International Trade Secretary stated it “ *serves as the basis of our country´s position in talks with MERCOSUR partners, guides senior officials in the process of negotiating in our country´s best interest, and provides a lens for the study of our partners´ positions in the talks*” **\[5.9\]**. 

### 1.  Unilateral tariff reductions 

 The research influenced the programme of unilateral tariff reductions. The officer in charge, Under\-secretary for Trade Facilitation, stated: “ *I have devoted strong efforts to the optimization of the exception lists. This work requires to be grounded in a general strategy to ensure that the decisions maximize the potential impact of tariffs on the economy*” and that Carluccio’s work was “ *very valuable, as it has helped organizing priorities, optimizing our strategy and communicating the decisions convincingly to both the authorities in the Ministry and representatives of the private sector”* **\[5.10\]**. The implementation of the strategy resulted in concrete measures, notably the reduction of tariffs for 10 key intermediate goods widely used in the textile, apparel, steel, paintings and bicycle sectors **\[5.1e\]**, **\[5.7e\]**. Tariffs were reduced from an average of 19% to an average of 5%, generating estimated yearly savings of over £53m for firms in highly employment\-intensive sectors **\[5.11b\]**. This was achieved with no damage to local workers because goods were selected for having nil or little local production, as research had shown that trade liberalisation can hurt employment and wages of the less\-skilled **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. 

### 1.  Negotiations of trade agreements with external countries and trading blocs 

 Carluccio’s work influenced Argentina's position in negotiations between MERCOSUR and other trading blocs, notably the EU\-MERCOSUR free\-trade deal, for which an agreement in principle was signed in June 2019 after 20 years of negotiations, paving the way for the creation of the world’s biggest free trade area **\[5.1f\]** \(an agreement ‘in substance’ with the European Free Trade Area \(EFTA\) was reached in August 2019 and negotiations with Canada are underway\). The Economic Policy Secretary \(and former Secretary of Commerce\) affirmed that Carluccio’s research provided theoretical and empirical evidence that guided the negotiations: “ *The research highlighted that a reform of the tariff structure was essential to succeed in our main objective of achieving the “intelligent” integration of the Argentine economy into the world, a pillar of which is the signing of free trade agreements”* **\[5.6\]**, and the International Trade Undersecretary noted that “ *the research informed the process of trade agreement negotiations, on the one hand, by highlighting the kind of tariffs reforms necessary to achieve successful integration via free trade agreements and, on the other, by providing guidelines for the determination of our country´s offers in the negotiations.”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 The overall nature of the impact is summarised by the Economic Policy Secretary, who stated that Carluccio’s work in Argentina allowed him to “ *bridge between the theoretical ideas, concepts and empirical methods developed in his academic research and the particular cases of our country and MERCOSUR, enhancing our policy\-making <…> and shaping the direction of fundamental reforms”* **\[5.6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Anziska’s research into the history of Palestinian statelessness has reached diverse public audiences across the Middle East, US and Europe, and his findings have reshaped contemporary policy discussions about the political horizons of the Israeli\-Palestinian conflict with policymakers, diplomats in the US and Europe, and leading Israeli and Palestinian officials. Anziska’s uncovering of vital new sources about the 1982 Lebanon War has led to the publication of primary archival material in an open source format in Arabic, Hebrew, and English in *The New York Review of Books, the Journal of Palestine Studies, Al\-Akhbar,* and *Jadaliyya.* These documents have fostered public debate over the legacy of US, Israeli, and Lebanese involvement in the Sabra and Shatila massacre across political divides in the Middle East. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In *Preventing Palestine: A Political History from Camp David to Oslo* \( **R1**\), Dr. Seth Anziska \(UCL’s Mohamed S. Farsi\-Polonsky Associate Professor of Jewish\-Muslim Relations since September 2015\) set out to answer how and why Palestinian statelessness persists despite longstanding efforts to address their quest for self\-determination. The project tackled a central conundrum in the field of 20th\-century international and global history, and brought local and regional narratives into conversation with one another. His research draws on Arabic, Hebrew, and English sources and explores diverse themes that include diaspora Jewish culture, inter\-Arab politics, domestic developments and the global Cold War, offering an award\-winning scholarly study that accounts for complex historical agency and traverses national divides \( **R1**\). 

 Anziska’s study revealed that, in the aftermath of decolonisation, during an era of mounting global attention to human rights, Palestinian claims for self\-determination began to receive a sympathetic hearing in the United States and Europe. Yet the negotiations over their political fate during the 1978 Camp David Accords served to undermine the prospect of sovereignty. Combining the political and conceptual history of Israel’s endorsement of limited autonomy, along with the physical expansion of the settlement project in the occupied territories and the military developments in Lebanon, the book \( **R1**\) and associated 2017 articles \( **R2**\) and \( **R3**\) reframe the early history of the peace process. *Preventing Palestine* re\-evaluates the Camp David summit and traces its impact on the limited political horizons for Palestinian sovereignty. The summit brought Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Egyptian President Anwar al\-Sadat, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter together for 13 intensive days of negotiations, and the result has often been depicted as Carter’s greatest diplomatic success. But the new sources uncovered by Anziska reveal a more troubling story about Palestinian political disenfranchisement that went hand in hand with the crafting of a bilateral peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. The rights of non\-Jewish residents in the occupied territories were relegated to separate discussions over autonomy between Egypt, Israel, and the United States \( **R3**\). The outcome of these talks stripped Palestinians of national or collective political sovereignty in favour of limited self\-rule, separating individuals from territory alongside the physical expansion of Israeli settlements. This legacy has real world consequences for the conflict today, as discussed in Anziska’s article on the Palestinian question in the era of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu \( **R2**\). 

 As the first scholar to utilise much of the most recently declassified sensitive historical material on the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1982 Lebanon War, Anziska made these primary sources available as an online archival resource. *Sabra and Shatila: New Revelations* \( **R4**\), published in *The New York Review of Books* in 2018, contextualised and made accessible 400\+ pages of primary source material for those who cannot access archives directly, often for political reasons of limited access to Israel for Arab and Palestinian researchers. Anziska’s research \( **R1**\- **R4**\) combined diverse archival sources and literature, which are often siloed into disparate historical accounts. Drawing on newly declassified records obtained during extensive fieldwork, Anziska brought together sources from the Middle East, US, and UK. This methodological approach was anchored in qualitative archival research positioned across geographic divisions, disparate historiographies, and scattered repositories in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, giving voice to a cross\-section of local agents, ideologies and external powers.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Shaping and informing debate and discussion among policy experts** 

 Anziska’s research \( **R1**\) changed how the Palestinian question is considered by international policymakers, especially the concept of “autonomy,” undermining the perceptions of political stalemate with new historical insights and forcing a change in conversation and political debate over possible diplomatic outcomes that limit Palestinian self\-determination. In breaking with conventional interpretations of the Israeli\-Palestinian peace process, Anziska’s research garnered close critical engagement from across the political spectrum, forcing responses from leading Israeli and American diplomats as well as generating sustained public debate in the Arab world. Key stakeholders on the Israeli\-Palestinian conflict in the US, UK, and Middle East have organised discussions around this research \(particularly **R1** and **R4**\) and invited Anziska to consult on policy implications, shaping debate and discussion amongst policy experts on Palestinian statelessness. This policy impact has been especially notable for its global reach. 

 Between August 2018 and December 2019, Anziska spoke or gave briefings at ten policy events in five different countries to a total audience of approximately 800 people. These presentations helped shape the debate about the ways in which Palestine statelessness has been perpetuated and how it might be addressed. Anziska has presented his findings \( **R1**\) to government officials and policy experts from Palestine, Jordan, the USA, the UK, Norway, and Sweden, including in 2019, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, House of Lords, and in 2018, foreign policy advisors to US Senator Bernie Sanders. He spoke to audiences of 200\+ people alongside leading figures including former Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shlomo Ben Ami, Palestinian scholar Areej Sabbagh\-Khoury, and Sari Nusseibeh, a leading Palestinian political figure. In Washington, D.C., Anziska presented his findings to the Foundation for Middle East Peace \(FMEP\) and Middle East Institute \(21 September 2018\) to >150 attendees \(plus 796 views on YouTube 04/08/20 and 1075 listens on Soundcloud 12/08/20\) \( **A**\). FMEP’s goal was “to expose an audience of subject\-matter experts, diplomats, think tank analysts, and activists to Anziska’s research, in order to challenge them to think beyond the existing and past peace paradigms, and to energize and empower them to imagine what a serious, viable way forward will entail”. The President of the FMEP, confirms that it was “a tremendous success in achieving that goal” \( **B**\). They describe how “by shining a spotlight on root causes of the failure of peace efforts, \[Anziska\] has already contributed to the ongoing shift in the public discourse around Israel\-Palestine, including the push for a U.S. policy that demands greater accountability from Israel, including by putting conditions on U.S. foreign assistance” and asserts that “should there one day again be a U.S. administration that attempts to promote Israeli\-Palestinian peace, Anziska’s book will be an invaluable resource and tool for those pushing for a U.S. policy that is not a return to the failed approaches of the past, but one that is instead grounded in the lessons of history, including those \[of \( **R1**\)\]” \( **B**\). In London, Anziska presented on \( **R1**\) to a closed group of 25 guests at the European Council on Foreign Relations \(11 October 2018\), which included experts at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. His role in informing and shaping policy debate is indicated by a Policy Fellow at the Council: “Anziska’s book has been an indispensable resource which has shaped my own thinking and policy recommendations to European governments, particularly in relation to President Donald Trump’s ‘Deal of the Century’. I have also referenced his work in my own analysis of the US plan and frequently recommended ‘ *Preventing Palestine*’ to European diplomats” \( **C**\). Anziska worked with the U.S./Middle East Project \(USMEP\), a New York\- and London\-based independent policy institute to support their provision of non\-partisan analysis of the Middle East peace process and policy options to prevent conflict throughout the region. As a visiting fellow, Anziska briefed government officials, NGOs, and regional experts on his research findings bi\-annually since 2015 \(Israel Policy Forum, September 2018; Bruno Kreisky Forum, May 2019; Open Society Foundation, June 2017\). At the 2019 USMEP board meeting, he presented his findings \( **R1**\) as part of a closed door panel with the Palestinian Ambassador to the UK, a former US Ambassador to Egypt and Israel, and several other officials \(including a former Israeli Foreign Minister and a former head of the Mossad\). 

 The implications of Anziska’s research challenged received wisdom about the failure to take Palestinian political claims seriously, particularly among a new generation of Israeli policymakers. Both Israeli and Palestinian officials have engaged closely with \( **R1**\) and endorsed it publically. Former Israeli Ambassador to the US Itamar Rabinovich wrote in 2018 that “ *Preventing Palestine* is mandatory reading for understanding the complexities and ironies of the Israeli\-Palestinian conflict.” Palestine Liberation Organization \(PLO\) Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi has recommended Anziska’s work in high\-level meetings to senior donors of the Palestinian Authority and wrote that \( **R1**\) is ""an essential account of a reality obscured by hostile political agendas and unabashed bias. \[…\] \[A\] historical revelation of enormous magnitude.” Anziska has debated the implications of his findings with over a dozen mid\-career Israeli officials at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, MA \(September 2019\). The Senior Programme Manager who invited Anziska designs seminars to “strengthen leadership skills, cohort build and explore the American Jewish Community.” They describe Anziska’s research as an “essential perspective for \[the fellows\] to hear”, and explain how the session provided “a framework” to “be a bit more open to each other’s perspectives, and to step out of their own comfort zones”, enabling the fellows to reflect on their positions on the conflict by engaging in debate with Anziska and one another \( **D**\). Former US President Jimmy Carter reviewed a pre\-publication copy of Anziska’s manuscript, and his lead Israel/Palestine advisor at the Carter Center has relied on \( **R1**\) “to set the historical narrative straight for our own efforts to find a just solution to the conflict” when crafting policy reports and writing on the Center’s work in the region. The advisor states, “\[Anziska’s\] ideas have impacted our understanding of the very broad and structural principles undergirding current Palestinian statelessness”, which has led to “a more careful and nuanced use of such concepts as self\-rule, autonomy and sovereignty” in the Center’s internal and external communications \( **E**\). In commenting on the presentation of these findings at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute in 2019, the advisor added, “Anziska must be credited for engaging with members of the public who were not always sympathetic to his conclusions and were even hostile, challenging his research” \( **E**\). 

 **Creating open\-access archives for Arabic\-, English\- and Hebrew\-reading audiences** 

 Anziska’s activities have shaped public awareness over the fate of Palestinian self\-determination by making archival material available for the first time to an audience of the Arabic\-, English\- and Hebrew\-reading public. The material Anziska discovered is now widely available online in an open access format \( **R4**\) hosted by *The New York Review of Books* \(>100,000 readers\), which provides an opportunity for the wider public to inspect sensitive archival material. This is particularly significant because for political reasons the majority of Arab and Palestinian populations have limited access to Israel and its archives. It was also published in the *Journal of Palestine Studies* and the leading Middle East\-focused online platform *Jadaliyya*, with scholarly essays introducing the primary material in both cases. These publications deepened public understanding by providing an online repository for the broader, Arabic\-, English\- and Hebrew\-reading public to examine the roots of political violence in the 1982 War, the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians by Christian Phalange militiamen under Israeli control, and the consequences of this violence. Lebanon’s leading *Al\-Akhbar* newspaper \(circulation 90,000\) featured Arabic translations of Anziska’s findings on the front page \(29 September 2018\) and an interview with Anziska which generated public discussion of the findings, reflected in reviews of \( **R1**\) \( **F**\) and wider Arabic media coverage such as in *An\-Nahar* newspaper \(2 October 2018\) \( **G**\). In the context of Lebanese politics this attention and dissemination is especially notable, given the political importance of the warlords who carried out the violence in 1982 and are now in power. Positive reviews of \( **R4**\) in Hebrew journals and newspapers, as well as continued availability of the material online, signals that this research is shaping memorialization practices in Israel, where much of this topic remains highly charged and under\-addressed by scholars. In *The Regional Thinking Forum*, one reviewer discussed the way \( **R1**\) is reshaping how Israel understands its past and engagement with the peace process: “From the historical perspective it offers, one can better see the profound change that has taken place in the Israeli public in the last two decades” \( **F**\). The provenance of the documents Anziska unearthed were discussed in the leading Israeli newspaper *Yedioth Ahoronoth* in February 2020 \( **F**\), while reviewers in *Haaretz* called the work “meticulously researched” in a featured 2019 essay looking at the way this history has shaped the discourse around Palestinian statehood today \( **F**\). 

 **Shaping public awareness of Palestinian statelessness** 

 Anziska’s activities have shaped public awareness over the fate of Palestinian self\-determination and have reached a large international audience. Between \( **R1**\)’s release in 2018 and the end of the impact period, Anziska sold over 2000 hardback \(a paperback version was published in March 2020\). As an indication of the regional and global reach of the research, the Institute for Palestine Studies in Beirut are producing an Arabic trade press translation of *Preventing Palestine*, intended for a general readership. The book has been the subject of leading current and religious affairs podcasts, including the *Tel Aviv Review* \(26 November 2018\) and *The Sacred* \(14 November 2018, 1851 listens on Soundcloud alone\). There have also been over fifty published reviews and discussions of \( **R1**\), in more than five languages \(including French, Spanish, German, Norwegian and Dutch\). This includes leading print and online outlets such as *The Guardian, The Financial Times, Haaretz, The Jordan Times, Orient XXI, The New Rambler Review, the Los Angeles Review of Books, the Cairo Review of Books, Al\-Akhbar, and Yediot Aharonth* \( **F**\). The book generated responses ranging from a featured review by US diplomat Dennis Ross in *Foreign Policy* to critical reviews in the Arabic press. This engagement with Anziska’s research in the international press has forced a reconsideration of received wisdom about Palestinian statelessness and the future of the conflict across the political spectrum. The conversation it has engendered is indicated by \( **R1**\)’s treatment by *Fathom* \(‘For a deeper understanding of Israel and the region’\). In February 2019, *Fathom* published a critical review of \( **R1**\) as part of an exchange format whereby part 1 constituted the review and part 2, Anziska’s response to it. In using this conversation\-based format, *Fathom* acknowledged \( **R1**\)’s role in shaping public debate about Palestinian statelessness. Even those who disagreed with the findings, such as the author of part 1, recognized the contribution of the work. ""The book must receive the credit it deserves,” wrote the author, a former Israeli legal advisor at Camp David. “Anziska did a very good research job and has collected and pieced together an enormous amount of information, including information derived from newly\-declassified American and Israeli records, some of which even an avid consumer of books related to the Middle East peace process like me has not previously seen"" \( **F,** p.25\). *Fathom* published a further piece on \( **R1**\) in June 2019, demonstrating its continued relevance to their audience. Anziska’s research also featured in a documentary made for France TV/3 Via Stella: *Camp David: La Prix de la Paix* \( **H**\), which aired in 2019. The director wrote, “ *Preventing Palestine: A Political History from Camp David to Oslo* has been one of my main sources for the writing of the screenplay of this film and the dialogue we had with Dr. Anziska before the shooting of interview was crucial \[…\] everything you can hope for as a documentary director: a great insight on the subject expressed in a clear, straightforward and concise way.” \( **I**\). In recognition of its importance, *Preventing Palestine* has been awarded the British Association of Jewish Studies Best Book of 2019, named one of the “best human rights books of 2018” by the Hong Kong Free Press, and included by the Forward in a list of books that US officials “should have read” before unveiling their troubling diplomatic initiative in January 2020 \( **F**\).

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of York research achieved positive impact on health policy, service quality and delivery benefitting patient health as part of cardiac rehabilitation \(CR\): 

1.  Developed key performance indicators and a new analytic approach leading to a National Certification Programme for CR demonstrating a 30% improvement in service quality; 

1.  Played a key role in reducing national CR wait times by more than 50% with an associated \(economically\-modelled\) increase in uptake of 15% and improved long\-term patient health evidenced by a favourable cost per quality\-adjusted life\-year of GBP3,286; 

1.  Improved CR provision for patients with heart failure through an award winning self\-management intervention, incorporating our chair based exercise programme, leading to implementation and roll\-out within the National Health Service \(NHS\); 

1.  Strategy, policy and clinical guidance: Influenced British Heart Foundation Strategy, The NHS Long\-term Plan and international clinical guidance.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

-  University of York \(UoY\) research by **Doherty, Harrison**, **Bojke and Hinde**: 

 Through a series of robust observational studies utilising national registry data Doherty and colleagues evaluated cardiac rehabilitation \(CR\) service quality and also determined the extent to which waiting times influenced patient outcomes. Statistical analyses accounted for confounders and used transparent reporting methods: 

 <ins>Study one</ins> applied a new analytical approach utilising national registry data from routine clinical practice to evaluate the extent to which CR programmes met minimum standards and key performance indicators of service quality. This research concluded that in the period 2013 to 2014 only 27 CR programmes \(12%\) met all CR quality criteria and that 5% of programmes failed to meet any of the quality criteria **\(3.1\)**. This approach helped establish the first UK CR service performance categories and directly informed the creation of the National Certification Programme in 2016. 

 <ins>Study two</ins> used logistic and multinomial regression to investigate the influence of CR timing on psychological outcomes in 39,588 post heart attack patients. This was the first study to conclude that longer wait times were associated with less than optimal mental health outcomes **\(3.2\)**. This complemented a previous study published in 2016 \(by Doherty\) confirming the benefits of timely CR on physical fitness and physical activity status. 

-  Doherty was co\-investigator on a National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) programme grant ‘Rehabilitation Enablement in Chronic Heart Failure \(REACH\-HF\)’ that developed and evaluated, through a clinical trial, a new self\-managed home\-based intervention for patients with heart failure. The intervention was developed with patient and carer involvement and was proven to be safe, clinically effective and cost effective. Doherty developed the chair\-based exercise intervention incorporating seven exercise intensity levels quantifying the metabolic costs for each of the exercise levels. He also led the exercise prescription component of REACH\-HF which created a new tailored exercise approach for patients with heart failure. Doherty was principal investigator for the York NHS Hospital trial, one of four sites across the UK that delivered REACH\-HF **\(3.3\)**. 

-  Doherty was one of three co\-leads on a European\-wide project \(Cardiac Rehabilitation Outcome Study\-CROS\) with the Cochrane Group, Heidelberg University. This was the first study to exclude pre\-1995 CR studies as part of their systematic review and meta\-analysis investigating the prognostic effects of CR in the modern era of cardiology. This research, based on a sample size of 232,295 patients, established CR effectiveness but raised serious concerns about the quality of CR interventions included in clinical trials. Through its analysis of registry \(clinically based\) studies, it also highlighted poor quality in CR services as part of routine clinical practice across Europe **\(3.4\)**. 

-  Doherty was co\-investigator on an NIHR programme grant evaluating the effectiveness of psychological interventions through a rigorous clinical trial in patients with depression and anxiety which are conditions known to act as barriers to CR uptake. Doherty was involved in the design, implementation, analysis and dissemination of this research, which proved that CR plus behaviour activation therapy was clinically effective. The group also carried out a novel cost effectiveness systematic review of CR in the modern era of cardiology \(influenced by Doherty’s CROS research\) which informed the first value for money case for CR **\(3.5\)**. 

-  Bojke, Hinde, Doherty and Harrison, supported by NIHR and British Heart Foundation \(BHF\) carried out a de novo approach to health economic modelling using and adapting systematic review evidence combined with National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation \(NACR\) data resulting in the development of a tailored health economic model evaluating increased uptake and health gains by socioeconomic status in cardiac patients attending CR. This research has directly informed the NHS England Long\-term Plan targets and BHF Strategy **\(3.6\)**.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

##  \[Impact I\] Developed clinical standards and National Certification Programme 

1.  Research by Doherty developed key performance indicators and an analytic approach leading to the foundation of a National Certification Programme for CR \(NCP\_CR\). This is run jointly by the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation \(BACPR\) and national audit team **\(3.1 & 3.2\)**. The National Certification Programme monitors and reports on the quality of CR delivery against published clinical minimum standards. Longitudinal national audit data shows that CR quality has improved significantly from only 27 programmes \(12%\) in 2014 to 93 programmes \(42%\) achieving full certification status in 2020 representing a 30% improvement. British Journal of Cardiology \(2016\) **\(5.1a\)**. 

1.  The same research informed clinical standards and core components used by over 230 clinical programmes across the UK. \( **3.1** is reference 81 in the quotation below\): 

 *“The ultimate goal is for all CR programmes to deliver services in line with the Standards and Core Components in this document, however at present most programmes are working towards the minimum standards as outlined in the NCP\_CR.<sup> **81**</sup>” Page 19 BACPR Standards and Core Components \(2017\)* **\(5.1b\)**. 

1.  National reporting of key performance indicators as part of the NCP\_CR showing that the quality of CR has increased since this research was conducted. BHF Quality and Outcomes Report 2020 page 23 \(5.1c\). 

1.  UoY research on the development and success of a national certification programme and minimum standards was viewed, by the European Association for Preventive Cardiology, as the first to implement and evaluate minimum standards which were then used to inform the development and implementation of European standardization and quality improvement of secondary prevention:                                                                                                         *“The use of minimum standards for the evaluation of the quality of CR has been tested elsewhere <sup>21</sup>” Page 2* Standardization and quality improvement of secondary prevention through cardiovascular rehabilitation programmes in Europe: Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2020. Reference 21 in the quote is **3.1, \(5.1d\)**. 

##  \[Impact II\]  Improving national CR wait times and patient outcomes 

1.  Research presented at national and international conferences in 2015 and 2016 showed that timely CR led to improved mental health and physical health outcomes **\(3.2\)**. The BACPR standards writing group reviewed Doherty’s research on waiting times and CR delay and used it to support timely CR as part of their standards. Using published data collected as part of NHS Digital audits the quotation below highlights more than a 50% reduction in waiting times driven by UoY research: 

 *“In 2020, UK median CR wait times have reduced to 33 and 21 days for surgical and non\-surgical patients, respectively. This represents a reduction in waiting time of 21 days for surgical patients and of 19 days for non\-surgical patients compared with 2014 surpassing national targets and yielding significant improvements in service delivery and patient benefit by avoiding delay \(Hinde et al 2020\). This change in clinical practice owes much to sustained BHF\-funded studies at the University of York on wait times. Before these studies, average wait times had only decreased by 2.5 days between 2011 and 2014.”* Page 20 BHF Quality and Outcomes Report 2020 **\(5.2a\)**. 

1.  UoY research on waiting times has continued to inform new versions of clinical standards evidenced by the following quotation where reference 28 in the quotation is our research on the benefits of early CR: “There is continued emphasis on the importance of early CR which is both safe and feasible, and improves patient uptake and adherence.21–28” Page 511 BACPR, Standards and Core Components. Heart 2019;105:510\-515 \( **5.2b\)**. 

1.  The quotation below cites two UoY studies, on the impact of early rehabilitation on psychological outcomes and physical outcomes, as the only references used to inform the decision to include early CR as a minimum standard for CR services across Europe: *“The timing of CR has a significant impact on fitness<sup>53</sup> and psychological outcomes <sup>54</sup>” page 3 of*   Standardization and quality improvement of secondary prevention through cardiovascular rehabilitation programmes in Europe: Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2020 **\(5.2c\)**. 

1.  Beyond the recognised improvement in physical and mental health outcomes for patients, evidenced through UoY research on timely CR, there is also a service level benefit achieved through enhanced uptake. Timely CR increases the likelihood of patients starting whereas delayed CR decreases the likelihood. Health economic modelling of timely CR has quantified a 15.3% benefit in CR uptake \(i.e. \~ 20,786 more patients based on 2019 national audit data\) and improved long\-term health with a cost per quality\-adjusted life\-year of GBP3,286 **\(5.2d\)**. 

##  \[Impact III\] Development and implementation of a new self\-management intervention to address a known gap in CR delivery for patients with heart failure \(HF\). 

1.  The REACH\-HF programme of research including Doherty’s chair based exercise intervention was developed with extensive patient and carer involvement. Clinical and cost effectiveness was established **\(3.3\)** after which REACH\-HF was rolled out through four NHS Beacon sites and four Scottish Health Boards. Roll\-out was supported by NIHR, NHS England/Scotland. NHS Digital also introduced REACH\-HF as a new mode of delivery option in Jan 2019 allowing clinicians to routinely record this intervention as part of an NHS provision. The REACH\-HF service implementation approach, outlined above, won the BMJ Services Award for Stroke and Cardiovascular Services in 2020 **.** The BMJ award recognised REACH\-HF for its excellence in healthcare provision and for successfully implementing leading research into NHS clinical practice **\(5.3a\)**. 

1.  REACH\-HF was adopted by the South West Academic Health Sciences Network **\(5.3b\)**. 

1.  The REACH\-HF intervention was adopted nationally by the BHF and BACPR as part of the Covid\-19 initiative to enable older patients with heart failure to exercise safely at home. In response to Covid\-19 NHS service changes and an urgent need for online training of NHS staff, Doherty and REACH\-HF colleagues changed their face\-to\-face facilitator course to online training. In doing so they successfully delivered training to 100 staff leading to an increase in home\-based CR services in the UK. Doherty also adapted his chair based exercise programme making it freely available to NHS staff and patients online. National audit data pre\-Covid \(2019\) vs Covid era \(2020\) confirms that the proportion of patients with heart failure taking up hospital\-based CR dropped by 47% whereas home\-based CR increased by 52%. Based on the success of our Covid\-19 response along with development and implementation of online training for NHS staff, NICE endorsed REACH\-HF as a quality assured shared learning example under the theme of Covid\-19\-ready\-rehabilitation\-for\-heart\-failure **\(5.3c\)**. 

##  \[Impact IV\] Policy and practice: NHS Long\-term Plan; British Heart Foundation Strategy and international clinical guidance. 

1.  In 2019 UoY researchers \(Doherty, Harrison, Hinde, Bojke\) were asked by NHS England and BHF executives to investigate, as part of NHS Long\-term Plan preparations, the cost benefit of increasing CR uptake. Our findings and calculations \( **3.6** also incorporating **3.5** in the cost analysis\), were used to aid decision making and set targets as part of the NHS Long\-term Plan and BHF Strategy: 

 *“Scaling up and improving marketing of cardiac rehabilitation to be amongst the best in Europe will prevent up to 23,000 premature deaths and 50,000 acute admissions over 10 years”  \(Page 63 section 3.72 of the Long Term Plan\)* **\(5.4a\)**. 

 BHF strategy document \(The Big Picture 2018\) used our research findings and UoY based National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation data to set its 65% and 85% targets: *“Achieving an uptake rate of 65% would result in 8,500 fewer deaths and 21,000 fewer hospital readmissions over 10 years. And reaching 85% uptake could save a remarkable 20,000 lives and avoid nearly 50,000 admissions over the next decade, as well as saving the NHS tens of millions of pounds. Source: Hinde S, Bojke L, Harrison A, Doherty P. \(2018\) Modelling of potential CR uptake scenarios for the BHF vs 2015/16 NACR data”* Page 3 **\(5.4a\)**. 

1.  Our joint European collaborative research project entitled Cardiac Rehabilitation Outcome Study \(CROS\) was used to inform Scottish National Clinical Guidance SIGN 150: 

 *“While CR meets the definition of a complex intervention, with studies including some or all of the elements described in the BACPR pathway, systematic reviews have concluded that the reduction in cardiovascular mortality associated with attending CR can be attributed to the exercise component.<sup>5,6</sup>”* Page 1, Reference 6 is **3.4**, **\(5.4b\)**. 

 The CROS project systematic review and meta\-analysis also informed European standards on the ability of CR to benefit patients by reducing premature death: 

 *“Previous data, including recent meta\-analysis have shown the efficacy of CR <sup>3</sup><sup>,5</sup><sup>–7</sup> to reduce mortality”* Page 2, reference 5 is **3.4**, **\(5.4b\)**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers in the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute \(HCRI\) carried out a series of projects about emergency medical responses to sudden onset disasters, with a focus on the collection, preservation and ownership of medical data. The team’s findings informed *World Health Organization* \(WHO\) guidelines for Emergency Medical Teams \(EMTs\), first published in 2013, which set the standards now used to validate EMTs globally. Drawing on the research, HCRI staff established \(2016\) and trained the UK EMT through UK\-Med, a closely associated Non\-Governmental Organisation \(NGO\). HCRI led programmes of work to support EMTs in several countries to reach the standards required for WHO validation. The research led to HCRI’s designation in 2016 as a collaborating centre of the WHO, through which it carries out activities in support of WHO programmes. In 2020 this designation was extended to 2022. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The impact is underpinned by a sequence of interrelated research projects on medical data and EMTs carried out by HCRI researchers since 2010. 

##  Medical Responses to Sudden Onset Disasters 

 In 2010, HCRI collaborated with the NGO Handicap International to examine anonymised medical records relating to amputation rates in the context of the January 2010 Haiti earthquake. The chaos that followed the major earthquake in Port\-au\-Prince resulted in a multidisciplinary investigation bringing together medical staff from HCRI \(Redmond\), NGO staff \(Calvot, Duttine\) and humanities researchers \(Taithe\). The team addressed the effectiveness of over 300 emergency humanitarian medical responses \(now referred to as Emergency Medical Teams, or EMTs\) to sudden onset disasters. 

 The research \[1\] illuminated significant factors undermining an effective treatment of the traumatic injuries Haitians suffered during the earthquake. These factors included: the unreliability of medical data; that patients had limited ownership of their own medical records; and that field report statistics were inflated and unreliable because of both their ignorance of, and incapacity to accommodate, the agency of patients. Most foreign medical teams \(with the exception of a handful of NGOs such as Médecins Sans Frontières \(MSF\) or the Cuban medical teams\) produced inadequate and unreliable data. Cross\-examining statistical evidence with a qualitative survey of 87 patients, the research demonstrated that patient understandings of care differed significantly from the reports given by medical teams. Through qualitative work with amputees, the research demonstrated that many had managed their own treatment and self\-referred. It also established: i\) the need to develop a validated international control on emergency medical teams, a call for which was published in *The Lancet* \[2\]; and ii\) the need to reassess the manner in which medical data was collected, preserved and owned in sudden onset disaster settings \[1\]. 

 The WHO did not have established minimum standards for health service provision, for the collection of medical data, or reporting systems for medical responses to sudden onset disasters at that time. The policy\-focused research \[1, 2\] led the WHO to establish a Foreign Medical Team \(FMT\) Working Group in 2011 \( [https://www.who.int/hac/global\_health\_cluster/fmt/en/](https://www.who.int/hac/global_health_cluster/fmt/en/)\) that recognised the problems epitomised in the Haiti response and responded to the call in *The Lancet* \[2\]. Hughes and Redmond were invited to participate in the international working group, resulting in recommendations supported by HCRI research, including an initial classification system for FMTs \(later renamed EMTs\) that establishes minimum professional standards \[see also section 4\]. 

##  Improving Medical Record Data 

 Further research \[3\] exposed the need to reassess the manner in which medical data was collected, preserved and owned in sudden onset disaster settings. It argued for the standardisation of the content of medical records kept by FMTs in sudden onset disasters to ensure that robust follow\-up arrangements are documented and meet the minimum standards for FMT practice. In the years that followed, HCRI staff conducted research into improving medical record data. This research: 

-  Developed and tested a minimum summary sheet for sudden onset disasters \[4\]; 

-  Proposed a three\-step operational learning framework that could be used for EMTs globally. The proposed framework includes the following steps: 1\) ensure professional competence and license to practice; 2\) support adaptation of technical and non\-technical professional capacities into the low\-resource and emergency context; and 3\) prepare for an effective team performance in the field \[5\]. 

-  Concluded that the principles of the NHS emergency care data set apply in a disaster response and should be used in EMT electronic patient record structures \[6\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 HCRI research findings have made a substantial contribution to the establishment of new norms and standards for the validation and training of EMTs authorised internationally to deploy and register in another country to deliver post\-disaster healthcare. Prior to 2013, foreign improvised response teams often arrived suddenly in countries where a disaster had occurred \(e.g. the Haiti earthquake and Pakistan floods in 2010\). These medical teams were unverified as to their equipment, training or skills. They could add to the confusion and stress of difficult times and left poor evidence of their interventions on patients. The paucity of data and inadequate medical records had lifelong consequences for the victims of disasters \[1, 2\], such as inadequate rehabilitation or loss of legal redress for malpractice. 

 The impact of the research is demonstrated in three areas: \(1\) Informing WHO policymaking on EMTs; \(2\) Creating and training the UK EMT; and \(3\) International training and validation of EMTs. 

##  1. Informing WHO policymaking on EMTs 

 In response to the research in Haiti \[1, 2\], the WHO invited Hughes and Redmond to contribute their research to an initiative to develop a classification system and set minimum standards for EMTs. This initiative produced benchmarks for international teams, published in 2013 and revised since as the ‘Classification and Minimum Standards for Foreign Medical Teams in Sudden Onset Disaster’ \(the ‘Blue Book’\) \[A\], citing \[1\]. HCRI research shaped the content of this field\-guide document, which has been applied and used globally throughout the assessment period. The contribution of HCRI research is recognised in the acknowledgements of the Blue Book \[A, p. 7\], and in the fact that the Book responded to all the demands of the 2011 call published in *The Lancet* \[2\]. 

 Following this normative phase in 2013, HCRI research subsequently shaped the WHO Working Groups for EMT Training and contributed to the process of developing a template for a minimum data set and uniform reporting system in disaster zones. This work continues to inform ongoing revisions of the EMT guidelines today \[e.g. activity reported in B\]. 

 In recognition of this work, HCRI was granted the status of a WHO Collaborating Centre for the Humanitarian Policy and Guidance unit in the Emergency Operations Department at WHO for a period of 4 years from 2016 \[C.i\]. The status recognises the significance of the research \[including 3, 4, 5 and 6\] and the role of HCRI in supporting WHO programmes. HCRI is the only existing collaborating centre of the 57 UK centres to be based in a faculty of humanities. The 2016 terms of reference for this partnership \[C.i\] specifically outlined areas for HCRI to conduct research and support the WHO in key areas of interest to its operational work\-plan, including EMT data, training, capacity building, research into the effectiveness of EMTs, and the quality of and accountability for the medical data EMTs generate \[5, 6\]. In January 2020, this status was renewed until 2022 \[C.ii\], even though at this time the WHO reduced the number of collaborating centres worldwide to 800 \[C.iii\]. 

##  2. Creating and training the UK EMT 

 The research informed the creation of the UK EMT, founded in 2016 as a partnership between the former UK Department for International Development \(DFID\), the NHS, Public Health England, Handicap International, the UK Fire and Rescue Service and UK\-Med. HCRI’s research continues to underpin the UK EMT’s work. UK\-Med \( [https://www.uk\-med.org/](https://www.uk-med.org/)\) is a medical NGO, formerly directed by Redmond and hosted in HCRI since 2013, which prepares medical teams to respond to sudden onset disasters and provides training for healthcare workers in countries at high risk of disease outbreaks, conflict or natural disasters. UK\-Med and HCRI have a formal agreement to collaborate on research and training \[D.i\]. Through the UK\-Med/HCRI partnership, research on EMTs carried out by HCRI staff continuously informs UK\-Med training and operations \(approximately 1,100 UK clinicians trained \[D.ii\]\). In 2016, UK\-Med was awarded a large DFID five\-year contract of approximately GBP8,000,000 to train and recruit staff for the national UK EMT in collaboration with HCRI \[D.iii\]. Each year UK\-Med rotates six teams of 60 clinicians who are on\-call for a period of two months \[D.iv\]. The teams have been deployed to disaster and disease outbreak responses, including the response to the Cyclone in Mozambique in 2019 and the COVID\-19 response in 2020 \[D.v\]. 

 The work since 2016 built on UK\-Med’s central contribution to the UK Ebola Response in Sierra Leone Programme in 2014. In 2016, Hughes was awarded an MBE in recognition for her work in leading UK\-Med trained NHS volunteers in Ebola response in West Africa and was named a ‘Point of Light’ by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015 \[D.vi\]. 

 In 2016, the WHO launched its global classification process and Global EMT list. Managed by the WHO EMT Secretariat, the process allows EMTs to register for mentoring and eventually to be classified as internationally deployable. In the same year, the UK EMT was one of the first teams to be verified by the WHO \[E\], having met the standards required to deploy a full field hospital \(type\-2\) to a sudden onset disaster using the framework developed as a result of the research \[5\]. In all recent deployments, HCRI’s research \[particularly 4 and 6\] has informed the practices and recording processes of the UK EMT. 

##  3. International training and validation of EMTs 

 Following the pioneering validation of the UK EMT, in 2016 HCRI established a collaboration with the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine \(HKAM\) to develop a research agenda on EMTs and a training programme to support Chinese EMTs to meet the WHO standards \[F.i\]. Through the dual focus of this partnership, HCRI’s earlier EMTs research \[1, 2, 3\] shaped training and the development of standards, which, in turn, led to the further development and application of research on EMTs through wider collaboration. The project with HKAM both contributed to the research for outputs \[4\], \[5\] and \[6\] and had a significant impact on training. Using HCRI processes and research\-based guidelines, between 2016 and 2018 HCRI and UK\-Med trained 431 medical staff in mainland China and 118 in Hong Kong \[F.ii\]. This programme included an EMT training event in Dali, China, in September 2017, which involved team leaders from the 37 Chinese national EMTs \(91 participants\) \[F.ii\]. Training events for West China Hospital took place in February and April 2018 \(total participants 219\) \[F.ii\], providing technical support and full field hospital simulation pre\-deployment training \[F.iii\] in preparation for verification by WHO. The West China Hospital EMT was verified by WHO later in 2018 \[F.iv\]. 

 The partnership also established a significant role for the HKAM\-HCRI team in the WHO EMT network at Secretariat level, through taking up a Working Member role in the WHO EMT Training Working Group \[F.ii\]. This Group aimed to develop a set of standardised guidelines for developing the training plan of EMTs. Redmond participated in Working Group meetings in April and September 2017 \[F.ii\], which generated a standardised list of training topics and subtopics for EMTs globally for the 26 EMTs classified and 70 EMTs working towards classification. 

 Between 2017 and 2019, HCRI took up a leading role in the Training for Emergency Medical Teams and European Medical Corps \(TEAMS\) project \[G.i\]. TEAMS was an EC\-funded consortium which researched, developed, piloted and assessed a standardised, cost\-effective and sustainable operational training package for different types of EMTs within low\-income countries. The resulting TEAMS Training Package, which is underpinned by the findings in \[5\], was endorsed by the WHO EMT Secretariat in 2019 \[G.ii\]; WHO is preparing to roll out the training package from 2021. 

 In January 2020, WHO directors for the AFRO region of the UN organisation invited HCRI and UK\-Med to contribute to the development of African EMTs, with a focus on outbreaks. The renewal of HCRI’s status as a Collaborating Centre of the WHO in January 2020 \[C.ii\] ensures the continuation of research impact that corresponds closely to field\-based realities as well as WHO regional priorities. HCRI work has thus had impact at an international level through WHO, nationally in the UK, internationally in China and Hong Kong and Africa since Ebola.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Despite an aging population, both in the UK and globally, the built environments older people live in are often unfriendly, unfamiliar and inaccessible. *Older People’s Use of Unfamiliar Space \(OPUS\)* has had a significant impact on the way people look at the built environment. Both nationally and internationally, this change in understanding has resulted in concrete measures to improve accessibility for older people. Councils, national governments and international organisations, i.e. the European Commission and the WHO in Europe, have all included OPUS as the basis or evidence for policy regarding age\-friendly built environments. In addition, OPUS has underpinned Public Health England efforts to encourage physical activity in older people. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since the release of the Active Ageing Framework in 2002 by the World Health Organization \(WHO\), increasing attention has been paid to the specific needs of older persons. 

 Previous research has shown that growing older in familiar places, otherwise known as ‘ageing in place’, can mitigate deterioration in cognitive and physical ability. Much of this research has focused on the environments of and around older people’s residential accommodation. Less attention has been given to their experience of communal outdoor spaces, such as town centres, even as older people increasingly have the means and health to travel to new, unfamiliar environments. 

 Research by Walford and colleagues at Kingston University sought to understand how older people respond to unfamiliar environments by identifying triggers influencing their experience. The research project, entitled *Older People’s Use of Unfamiliar Space \(OPUS\)*, was funded through and  [published](http://www.newdynamics.group.shef.ac.uk/assets/files/NDA%20Findings_4.pdf) by the UK Research Councils’ *New Dynamics of Ageing* \(NDA\) *Programme* **\[R1\]**, in collaboration with Swansea University, and resulted in research outputs. 

 Uniting the different backgrounds of the researchers, which ranged from Walford’s focus on spatial data, to Samarasundera’s geographical focus, to Pratt’s work with film, OPUS built on conceptual aspects of environmental gerontology **\[R2\]** to adopt a mixed methods approach to investigate older people’s experiences of unfamiliar spaces. The researchers focused on understanding older people’s responses to these spaces in terms of accessibility, design quality, and walkability \(ease of navigation and wayfinding\). The OPUS project involved over 40 older participants, and their response to an unfamiliar environment – Colchester **.** In preparation, the Kingston team undertook urban design and walkability audits in situ. 

 All participants individually viewed a 31\-minute, filmed walking route round Colchester town centre in a 3D ‘virtual reality cave’. Questionnaires were used to assess cognitive variability. Participants watched the 31 minute filmed walking route around Colchester town centre, narrating their response which was captured on a digital recorder, while their physical responses were also monitored. The quality of the built environment was measured using these narratives and recorded physical responses. 12 participants visited Colchester and its town centre, where they explored the environment independently, and met with local older residents and town planners. These participants worked with members of the Kingston team to validate the urban design quality and walkability assessment audits. **\[R3, R4\]** 

 Analysis of these interrelated and integrated datasets \- the oral narratives; physiological measurements; street walkability and urban design audits; and the participant survey \- in combination and separately \- has been published in several research outputs. 

 The research determined that age\-friendly urban design features: 

-  Sightlines to buildings and other landmarks, especially those of historical significance. These are important navigational aids which assist wayfinding and with developing a rudimentary mental image of unfamiliar town centres **\[R2, R4\]** 

-  Signage in town centres and at key transport hubs. These should be positioned appropriately for older people and importantly indicate both distance and typical walking time to the destination **\[R4, R5\]**. 

 The research determined that more walkable built environments would feature: 

-  Easily navigable urban outdoor spaces. These are less stressful and more accessible from both emotional and physiological perspectives **\[R3, R5\]**. 

-  Familiar town centre brands \(e.g. national retailers\). These help to make unfamiliar environments less stressful as they can provide a psychological connection with familiar urban spaces **\[R4, R5\]**. 

 Interaction between older visitors to the town and similarly aged locals. This can help to clarify uncertainties over accepted norms in the navigation of such environments **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The OPUS project has had a significant impact on urban design policy at local, national and international levels: beginning with the local council in Colchester, where the research took place, its findings have been taken up by a range of bodies in the UK and across Europe. This has benefitted more and more older people, as planning and design policy has taken their experiences into account.<ins> **Councils’ Local Planning**</ins>OPUS’ findings first impacted spatial planning and design at the council level, raising awareness of the accessibility needs of older people as they navigate town centres, particularly in ageing societies. Local authorities have increasingly acknowledged that good urban design standards consider not only physical accessibility of buildings and other infrastructure, but also take account of mobility and navigation for all through public spaces. In their Better Town Centre plan, Colchester Borough Council used the OPUS project as a core evidence base to guide for planning policy for the town centre. They stated ‘ *New wayfinding measures will be informed by the findings of research involving older people’s use of Colchester’*; their policy documents link to and name the OPUS project. The plan also incorporated OPUS’ findings on the need to highlight landmarks and for the correct positioning of signage **\[S1\]**. First adopted as planning guidance in 2012, this document continues to provide ‘ *guidance on the Council’s planning policies and process’*, in determining planning applications **\[S1\]**. The OPUS study also features as part of the evidence base informing the Environment aspect of the council’s Emerging Local Plan 2017 – 2033 **\[S1\]**. 

 In October 2013, North Somerset Council Access Officer Anthony Rylands uploaded NDA4\-OPUS to the Design Standards \(Environment\) space, ranking it as ‘useful’ **\[S2\]**. In 2014 the North Somerset Council produced ‘People with Dementia and the Physical Environment’ to highlight issues that urban designers needed to consider **\[S2\]**. In this document, the Equality and Diversity team cited and applied the OPUS findings, stating that ‘ *landmarks are important navigational aids’* and requiring townscape designers to consider people’s mental maps and reactions to unfamiliar cues. <ins> **Activity for Age\-Friendly Nations**</ins> 

 In 2015, Age Cymru, a national charity working to improve the lives of all older people in Wales, explicitly drew attention to the work of the OPUS project. A citation was included in their response to the Welsh Government’s consultation document ‘Design in the Planning Process’, thus using the OPUS project to inform the policy debate **\[S3\]**. Informed by this consultation, the Welsh government decided to keep mandatory Design and Access statements for urban areas, with guidance that makes note of wayfinding systems and emphasises inclusive design principles. Shining a light on the built environment in Welsh communities in 2016, further evidence was drawn by Age Cymru from OPUS to promote accessible and inclusive age\-friendly environments **\[S4\]**. 

 The results of the OPUS study have been used a number of times by the U.K. Government: 

-  In September 2014, Public Health England \(PHE\) drew from OPUS in their Everybody Active, Every Day \- an implementation and evidence guide to address the nation’s inactivity epidemic. It used OPUS findings to support its claims that local government had the responsibility to regulate, lead on and design age\-friendly, healthy environments which promote a feeling of safety and security **\[S5\].** 

-  In March 2015, the Government Office for Science \(GO\-Science\) commissioned a Foresight evidence review about mobility and ageing **\[S6\]**. Citing OPUS **\[R2\]**, they stressed the importance of ‘ *the meanings and values attached to places and the perceptions of an environment that can give people confidence in a place*’. GO\-Science recommended that ‘ *mobility policies should be sensitive to’ the diversity of different age groups*’ and that the ‘ *design of the built environment can enable older people to access their neighbourhood*’. In 2016, The ‘Future of an Ageing Population’ final report, for which the evidence was purposed, listed as a key finding that ‘ *A well\-designed built environment can maximise the physical mobility of older people*’ **\[S7\]**. 

-  In July 2016, Nazhut Ali, PHE Lead, Older Adults, Health and Well Being, drew the link between access and activity in her presentation ‘Older People and Physical Activity Outdoors’ at a seminar day for academic, government and third sector organisations **\[S8\]**. Noting how regular physical activity can reduce many physical and mental diseases, medical visits, and social isolation, Ali critiqued the barriers preventing older people from accessing the outdoors, citing OPUS **\[R4\]**. This demonstrates how PHE’s strategy for activity is underpinned by OPUS’ findings about quality of access. 

-  In June 2017, GO\-Science furthered this access agenda by releasing workshop materials to support policymakers, such as the Scottish government’s Strategy Unit, to produce new policy recommendations. These materials cite the original evidence review **\[S6\]**, emphasising that ‘ *access is a key component*’ of neighbourhoods’ maximising their contribution to older people’s wellbeing. 

 Policy makers in the UK have, from the findings of OPUS, learnt about and promoted age\-inclusive design for a demographically ageing country. Through this strategic direction, OPUS has supported the well\-being and independence for older people throughout the country. 

 <ins> **International Policy for Ageing Populations**</ins> 

 A 2017 joint project between the European Commission’s Directorate\-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and the WHO Regional Office for Europe published, in 2018, the policy action handbook ‘Age\-friendly environments in Europe’ **\[S9\]**. Written primarily for local politicians, regional authorities, planners, and representatives of older people, this handbook cites OPUS frequently in the section ‘Urban environments that support belonging, continuity and sense of self’ and the subsection describing the important impact of feelings upon the use of place. Recommendations from this section to EU member states include five policy interventions and initiatives for local action plans. These work towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 – making cities safe and accessible for the elderly. 

 The project also stimulated public debate over various assumptions about elderly people. Guardian columnist Michele Hanson opened up a public dialogue about the NDA findings, including the OPUS results that urban space can be a ‘worrisome environment, and doesn’t always do your cardiac function much good’ **\[S10\],** resulting in a widely commented discussion. OPUS has provided an evidence base and a framework for policy makers to transform this ‘worrisome environment’.
