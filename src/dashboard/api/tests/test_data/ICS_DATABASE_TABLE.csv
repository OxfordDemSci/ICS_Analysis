###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The 2014 Department for Education curriculum reforms of English Literature precipitated declining student enrolments and sector confidence, and generated teachers’ need for new subject knowledge. Research at Royal Holloway has re\-invigorated the disciplinary value of English literature; strengthened the professional practices of two Examination Boards, and English teachers, thereby benefitting students. Researchers at Royal Holloway have provided Continued Professional Development and resources for teachers, consulted on syllabus reform for the Awarding Bodies OCR and Edexcel, and collaborated with Subject Associations, educational publishers, the English and Media Centre, British Library and Prince’s Teaching Institute. Royal Holloway’s research has shaped educational experience for A Level teachers and their students across the UK and internationally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The reformed English syllabi, including GCSE English, are heavily invested in heritage texts and operate within an educational economy that prioritises STEM subjects. The value of English Literature has consequently been downgraded, leading to a precipitous 25% decline in enrolments in English Literature A Level since 2016. Research undertaken at Royal Holloway has demonstrated the educational benefits of English Literature by redefining its cultural, historical and social value. 

 Robert Eaglestone’s book, *Literature. Why it matters* \(R1\), demonstrates how literary structures are found across the widest range of cultural expression, from poetry to news and computer games. This research demonstrates the importance of literature in our current era, both in forming cultural value and in intellectual development. Here, and in his book, *Doing English: A Guide for Literature Students* \(R2\), Eaglestone presents English Literature as a conversation rooted in community, as inculcating ‘ways of thinking’ rather than an assembly of ‘facts’. He demonstrates the relevance of English Literature to a changing economy, enabling the discipline to compete flexibly in a shifting educational environment. 

 Varty examines poetry in the context of the politics of its production and reception: the suffrage campaign and 1970s feminism are brought to bear on women’s poetry of WW1 in ‘Women’s Poetry in First World War Anthologies’ \(R3\), and the backdrop of Brexit illuminates poetry and performances by the female national poets of the UK in ‘National Poets on Tour’ \(R4\). By demonstrating the political context in which poetry is written and read, Varty’s research amplifies the disciplinary value of English Literature. 

 Research by Ryan and McGettigan applies historical context to literary study. Ryan’s book, *Shakespeare’s Universality* \(R5\), brings Shakespeare’s work powerfully into the present, championing techniques of close reading to free it from politically conservative interpretations enshrined in traditional scholarship. Ryan further revitalises Shakespeare for 21st century readers by drawing out the plays’ politics of social inclusion and progress.  McGettigan’s book, *Herman Melville* \(R6\), examines transatlantic relations between American authors and their British publishers in the nineteenth century to show how material print culture enhances the authority of the text within a divided American polis. 

 Together, these studies analyse the contexts in which texts are produced, and demonstrate how texts are illuminated by historically and philosophically enriched understanding. In light of Eaglestone’s research, they also advance understanding of the discipline of English Literature at large.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 \[text removed for publication\]. \[text removed for publication\], *Teaching English* \(October 2019\). \( **E3**\) 

 Professor Eaglestone is a major voice in defending and inspiring the teaching of English in schools. Leading educationalist Gary Snapper commented that his research led to ‘a resurgence of discussion about the transition between A Level and HE English’, and his work has been widely disseminated, including through the HEA’s Innovative Pedagogies series in 2015 \(reaching collectively over 38,000 readers \(E3\)\). *Literature: Why It Matters* \(R1\) has **shaped new ways of thinking about English as a discipline that have inspired teachers** and informed a growing movement of reconceptualising English Literature. Snapper reports: 

 \[text removed for publication\]. \(E3, E4\) 

 Eaglestone mobilised response to the threatened future of English by instigating and co\-chairing the national conference ‘English: Shared Futures’ \(E:SF\) in 2017. Described as \[text removed for publication\], this facilitated **a national revitalisation of English** by the major Subject Associations: the English Association, University English, the National Association of Writers in Education, the Institute of English Studies, the Higher Education Academy, joined by The National Association of Teachers of English \[NATE\] in 2019 for the second E:SF conference in 2020. As a result of Eagelstone’s research leadership, E:SF generated \[text removed for publication\] events since 2017, attended by over \[text removed for publication\] delegates. E:SF has become a festival of English, with its own website \(\[text removed for publication\] unique visits since 2017\), app, twitter, virtual publication, fringe, satellite and linked events. E:SF promotes disciplinary resilience by assuring thriving debate to enable professionals and organisations across the sector to adapt to changing educational circumstances, needs and values. Snapper commented that ‘For NATE, \[Eaglestone\] is a crucial link between the worlds of school and university English’, a claim borne out by delegate feedback from E:SF ONLINE 2020: ‘I consider the bigger picture more and have already incorporated some of the ideas and resources into my online teaching to KS3,4 and KS5’. Barbara Bleiman, Education Consultant, English and Media Centre, testifies to the value of Eaglestone’s vision: ‘I can think of no\-one else in university English who has been so influential in raising ideas, generating new initiatives and creating a unified sense of what the subject as a whole could and should be’. \(E4, E5\) 

 <ins> **Influencing the design and delivery of curriculum and syllabi**</ins> 

 Eaglestone’s contribution to shaping the rationale for English literature in schools is supported by more practical approaches. Eaglestone and Varty have influenced the A Level English Literature syllabus by serving as Advisory Board Members for the OCR and Edexcel Awarding Bodies when they **reformed specifications for A/AS Level English Literature and A Level English Literature and Language** to comply with the 2014 DfE Statutory Guidance, *English programmes of study: key stage 4*, and *GCE AS and A level subject content for English literature*. They helped these Awarding Bodies to develop their strategic approach to the discipline, select prescribed texts, and frame the Assessment Objectives. The revised syllabi were first taught in 2015. Together, Eaglestone and Varty have helped to shape the educational experience of more than 20% of English Literature A level students nationwide. \(E6\) 

 Eaglestone has **enhanced teachers’ understanding of syllabus change** by addressing events organised by Subject Associations, and at CPD programmes for the OCR. He has enlivened teachers’ ability to teach the requirement that students, ‘explore literary texts informed by different interpretations’ by, for example, workshop delivery at OCR A Level conferences \(collective reach of CPD: \[text removed for publication\] teachers E4, E6\). He also intervened directly in student learning, for example as author of the chapter 'What is English Literature?’ in the English and Media Centre publication *The Literature Reader* \(June 2019\). Education historian, Simon Gibbons, summarises: ‘Eaglestone consistently demonstrated his commitment to effective English teaching in secondary schools’ \( *English and its Teachers*, 2017\).\(E3\) 

 <ins> **Influencing delivery of syllabi in schools by developing subject knowledge**</ins> 

 Through sustained engagement with the pedagogic priorities of GCSE and A level teachers of English Literature, we have ensured that our research is made available and accessible to teachers via the department’s TeacherHub>English. This resource was founded by Eaglestone and colleagues in 2016 and addresses needs generated by the reformed national curriculum, outlined in the 2014 DfE Statutory Guidance. TeacherHub therefore provides: 1\) new understanding of the discipline and 2\) new subject knowledge. It reaches 127 subscribing schools and 176 named teacher participants. Freely available online, 48 videos and podcasts address 36 A level texts and topics \(including eight for Shakespeare\), have in excess of 79,000 unique views, international reach \(Brazil, India, United Arab Emirates\), and 1,140 YouTube subscribers. Annual CPD events have been led by McGettigan, Ryan and Varty \(collective attendance 71 teachers\), at which 98% of delegates reported that they would use the resources provided in the classroom, and 85% were more likely to teach the texts discussed as a result of attending \(E1\). Delegates since 2016, surveyed in May 2020, attest to long term benefit: ‘lots of these ideas have now become embedded in my own delivery and…have added a richness which has benefitted my A level students.’ \(E1\) 

 Bespoke visits for A level students to attend Shakespeare classes, and an emergency online Lockdown collaboration with London’s Harris Federation \(30 Academies across London\) in June 2020, have engaged over 100 teacher delegates, and over 500 A Level student visitors, with the outcomes of this research. Dr Rachel Roberts at the Institute of Education, University of Reading, reports, ‘I have used the resources myself in my teaching of PGCE students’, demonstrating that a generation of trainee teachers are teaching from this research. The reach of TeacherHub is further demonstrated by the fact that it is the top listed ‘University Website’ on the English and Media Centre ‘Digital Resources’ page: ‘For students considering…A Level English…the videos provide a taste of what it’s like to hear lectures from experts in their field’. Resources are also promoted to teachers by the Prince’s Teaching Institute, diversifying their reach and endorsing their significance. \(E1, E2\) 

 Teachers of A Level English have benefitted from Varty’s research on World War 1 Poetry by women. The anthology *Scars Upon My Heart* was set as a new core text for the reformed AQA A Level which required students to understand the poetry’s historical context. Varty’s research **enhances teachers’ knowledge** of how the poetry reflected the suffrage campaign, and their teaching is informed by a range of resources, articles and performances she produced. Her articles on this material, published in the English and Media Centre’s *Emagazine*, and Hodder’s *English Review* together reached c. \[text removed for publication\] schools nationwide and over \[text removed for publication\] print subscribers. English teacher Susan Ferguson at the Piggott School, Wargrave, reports that these have extended her subject knowledge, and boosted the aspirations of her students: ‘the article about Jessie Pope and the *Scars* work has been instrumental in making our teaching more interrogative. It helps our subject knowledge IMMENSELY’. \(E2, E3\) 

 To enhance students’ learning and participation, Varty developed an original playscript, ‘Emily’s Dream’ that demonstrated the confluence of suffrage campaigns and women’s war poetry. This resource for teaching *Scars Upon My Heart*, workshopped in December 2018 by 20 Year 8 students at The Cheney School, Oxford, \(performed to audience of c 300 students in the playground\), was published as a resource for teachers in *Teaching English* \(October 2019\) as an example of ‘creative reading’, reaching over \[text removed for publication\] NATE members \(print and online access\) comprising teachers, Education Departments, and PGCE students. Access to creative pedagogy was further widened by her invitation from the co\-curricular organisation Poetry by Heart \(PBH\) to write their 2019 Armistice Day blogpost about how ‘Emily’s Dream’ brings *Scars* to life \(reached 64,000 unique users, 4,651 teachers worldwide via PBH social media\). Of this, the \[text removed for publication\] PBH stated, \[text removed for publication\] \(E3, E9\) 

 Her research has also enhanced subject knowledge via the Prince’s Teaching Institute at an online CPD course Varty taught on ‘Suffrage Literature’ to \[text removed for publication\] teachers on 1 July 2020, reaching an estimated \[text removed for publication\] stating that ‘the course will have an impact on my pupils’ and 69% reporting an **increase in teaching confidence**. Qualitative responses include: ‘this was invaluable to me as a teacher for GCSE and A Level’; ‘This was a brilliant session, and has given me loads of ideas as we are currently re\-writing our curriculum’ \(E10\). Her TeacherHub>English CPD and videos on *Scars*, viewed 883 times between July 2018 and October 2020, generated such feedback as:  ‘I will teach context differently \(more holistic\)’ \(E1\). By making *Scars* more accessible, as well as by her pedagogic publications on Carol Ann Duffy based on \[text removed for publication\] \(E9\), Varty’s resources have increased availability of women poets within the syllabus. Varty’s research has led to **greater equality of gender representation** for a syllabus dominated by male authors and protagonists. 

 Ryan’s *Shakespeare’s Universality* has revitalised teaching of Shakespeare in GSCE English by re\-interpreting canonical texts fit for 21<sup>st</sup>\-century students. He was commissioned to write five articles on Shakespearian Tragedy for the British Library’s Discovering Literature series. They are endorsed by AQA on their webpage ‘Teaching Resources’ for GCSE English Literature, and  Andrea Varney at the British Library reports that Ryan’s articles are ‘amongst the most popular articles on our site’ \(E7\).  Between April 2018 and May 2020, they were viewed by 224,282 unique users. Ryan’s TeacherHub>English CPD on Shakespeare’s tragedies was described by teachers as ‘incredibly motivating’ and **‘inspiring and thought provoking’**. His TeacherHub>English videos on Shakespeare have been viewed over 1,862 times between April 2019 and October 2020. \(E1\). 

 Declining knowledge of American literature in schools arising from 2014 DfE policy to remove American Literature from the GCSE curriculum yet to retain it at A Level, has been addressed by McGettigan. A measure of stakeholders’ affirmation of the need for this can be seen in her 2017 award of GBP1600 from the US Embassy to lead CPD for teachers via TeacherHub>English. \(E8\) This redressed teachers’ lack of contextual knowledge about set texts for AQA and OCR A Level syllabi. It led to a collaboration with the Prince’s Teaching Institute, where McGettigan ran online CPD on ‘Arthur Miller and American Outsiders’ in November 2019, and to her online A level independent reading course on *Moby Dick*, for resource provider Massolit, viewed \[text removed for publication\] times between October 2017 and April 2020 \(available to \[text removed for publication\] subscribing institutions worldwide\) \(E8\). Her TeacherHub>English resources on American set texts have been collectively viewed over 4,787 times. Delegates at McGettigan’s CPD courses, which together reached 45 teachers, reported **a high increase in confidence** and stated that they would use their new knowledge in the classroom, eg.‘boosted my enthusiasm for next year’s teaching so many ideas and excellent resources’. \(E1\) Her article for students on ‘ *The Great Gatsby* and the American Dream’ enriched students’ subject knowledge, published by Hodder’s *English Review* in September 2020, circulated to \[text removed for publication\] schools nationwide \(E9\). 

 Barbara Bleiman, Poetry by Heart, and Garry Snapper all attest that Royal Holloway English researchers **demonstrate what the English Literature curriculum ‘could and should be’** \(E4, E9\). They have also given teachers necessary resources to produce new content for their GCSE and A\-level students.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research influenced the project management \(PM\) of clinical trials. The global pharmaceutical R&D spend is $125\-$160 billion annually and of that at least $20 billion is wasted annually due to management failures associated with clinical trials.  The research has devised new PM approaches, enhancing PM knowledge and capability, contributing to cultural change, by changing attitudes towards the efficacy of PM in clinical trials. It has led to cost and time efficiencies in the PM of specific clinical trials. For example, on one project detailed in the case study a cost saving of 80,000 GBP was reported during the clinical trial phase, with a time saving of 10 days, which by conservative estimates equates to a saving of at least 6m GBP on the overall cost of the drug development process. The efficiencies, which are in the form of reduced delays against schedule and elimination of wasteful activities, have a direct beneficial impact on patients through faster time to market of drugs, which can then also be more competitively priced if the associated development costs are reduced. 

  
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 To improve the management of clinical trial projects, Prof Bryde carried out research, with both academic and external academic and industrial partners, on addressing management challenges arising from the dominant business model in the pharmaceutical industry. In this model pharmaceutical \(pharma\) companies, who act as the client, outsource the project management of clinical trials to Clinical Research Organisations \(CROs\), who act as the supplier. 

 In\-depth interviews with PM practitioners, coupled with observations, expert opinion and literature review, identified the limitations of current clinical trial PM and resulted in the formulation of a new approach. This approach provided a model whereby outputs from a project were more closely aligned to the needs of the pharma client and the CRO supplier through deliverable\-based planning.  It also provided a new method to monitor progress, based on outputs rather than activities and milestones, and a novel treatment of costing the PM function based on meeting deliverables rather than PM being conceived as being a time\-based activity, as was traditionally the case \(Output 1\).  Interest in the research led to the Institute of Clinical Research \(ICR\) commissioning a book to disseminate the work to the practitioner community \(Output 2\). This research happened in 2005\-2007. This first phase of research provided the scaffold for the next phase, described in the next section. 

 A second phase to the research related to developing Earned Value Analysis \(EVA\)\-based methods which, when combined with the novel deliverable\-based planning methods that had previously been developed by Prof Bryde, further improved clinical trials PM. This improvement was achieved by using EVA\-based methods to help reconcile opposing perspectives and address agency\-related issues between pharma and CRO, in terms of achieving mutually beneficial outcomes from a clinical trial i.e. the pharma seeking a drug safely tested in a timely and cost effective manner and the CRO seeking to make an acceptable profit margin from the contract. This strand of research occurred between 2008 and 2014. Conditions for success of EVA in clinical trials were identified, derived from an analysis of the performance of two cases; one of which utilized EVA effectively and one that did not.  A framework of EVA conditions of success established a number of design\-related and operation\-related conditions that lead to beneficial outcomes for both pharma and CRO, by addressing adverse agency\-related characteristics in the project environment \(Output 3\). 

 Finally, building on the outputs of the research in the previous two phases, research undertaken in 2013\-2018 involved a multiple case study design.  Four project cases were analysed in detail: two from the construction industry and two involving clinical trials.  The focus of the analysis was on the management of the relationship between client and supplier.  By looking at one project that succeeded from each industry sector, and one project that failed, the research produced a new and innovative framework, which enables pharma and CRO to work together to mitigate for relational project risk and hence deliver successful outcomes. The CURED framework – which is an acronym for the CURED capability nodes of Contract, Understanding, Resources, Education and Delegation – provides a route map for collaborative working on clinical trials \(Output 4\).  This research was part\-funded by a grant from the Association of Project Management \(APM\) from their 2016/17 Research Fund, which is a competitive call for proposals and in 2018 the APM published online via their members website a white paper of the research findings \(Output 5\). The CURED Framework was foundational to a case study written by Dr Christine Unterhitzenberger, a co\-author of output 4 and 5, which won the Decision Sciences Institute/Project Management Institute Best Instructional Case Writing Competition 2019.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Efficiencies in the management of clinical trials have a massive impact on the overall success of the drug development cycle.  Faster time to market of drugs means earlier administration of effective new treatments for diseases. It also means that pharma have more time to sell a drug under patent and hence they can be more competitive in their pricing \(Association of British Pharma Industry\).  Data shows that 70% of clinical trials are more than one month behind schedule, with such delays costing pharma between 600,000 GBP and 7m GBP for each day that a clinical trial delays a drug’s development or launch \(Journal of Clinical Research Best Practice\).  Hence, the contribution of the underpinning research to improved PM practices and PM policy in undertaking clinical trials, documented below, has significant societal and economic impact. 

 **THE PM PRACTICES OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS** 

 <ins>H. LUNDBECK A/S</ins> 

 In 2019 staff at H. Lundbeck A/S \(HLU\), an international pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark, used the research findings from Outputs 4 and 5 as the driver to “re\-evaluate our entire governance Metrices and KPIs.  I have used your CURED framework…”  \(Kristine Dalsgaard Cohen\) \[Source 1\] The research enabled them to assess their preferred providers/strategic partnerships and internally benchmark the performance of different CROs.  “We have an internal workstream on the Metrics/KPI launched in Q3. As the Metrics/KPIs not only should allow us to measure the collaboration between HLU/CROs, but also give us a chance to compare internally between the various CRO collaborations.... Some kind of 3 dimensional approach” \[Source 1\]. 

 <ins>LEO PHARMA A/S</ins> 

 LEO Pharma A/S, a multinational Danish pharmaceutical company, utilised the research from Outputs 1 and 3 on a phase III clinical trial that started in 2014 to gain cost and time efficiencies.  The project had a contract value of 16,000,000 GBP over 3 years.  The client was in Denmark and the Clinical Research Organisation \[CRO\] project managing the clinical trial was in the UK.  In the first year of the project, the client identified a saving of 80,000 GBP through the elimination of change orders.  Comparable projects generated 3\-4 change orders per annum and dealing with these orders cost the client 40,000 GBP, based on 10 days of PM time costed at 1,000 GBP per day and the same amount for the Clinical Research Organisation \[CRO\].  The trial saved a further 10 days on the schedule in year 1 through improved PM \[Source 1\]. 

 <ins>BLAU FARMACEUTICA</ins> 

 The research \[Outputs 1 and 2\] has led to the development of a new procedure used in Blau Farmaceutica, a pharmaceutical company in Brazil since 2018. The company has incorporated the novel PM method developed from the research i.e. client/CRO aligned deliverable\-based planning and Earned Value Analysis approach for monitoring and control \- into their Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\) in respect of CRO and other Clinical Research Vendor selection. 

 “Outsourcing Clinical Research projects” \[Output 2\] really helped me to understand the overall outsourcing process. I cannot express how much I appreciate it\!  The indicators and examples given are really well defined, which helps the selection process become less subjective, more technical and focused on what really matters. With the addendum to ICH's E6 guideline, the pharmaceutical industry needs to establish increasingly robust processes for the CROs selection and oversight as well as other clinical research vendors and your book definitely helped me in the attempt to translate this into a clear and concise procedure \[Output 1\], according to my local reality” \[Source 2\]. 

 <ins>GSK VACCINES</ins> 

 In November 2019 the Strategic Partnership Management Group, Vaccine Division of GSK, headquarters in Brussels, Belgium and offices in Italy and the US invited Prof Bryde to disseminate the CURED framework \[Output 4 and 5\] to over 70 staff worldwide from the HQ and regional offices, some who attended physically and others by WebEx, as part of an awareness raising initiative relating to the need to manage relational risk when outsourcing work. 

 Laura Lulli, Strategic Partnership Manager, GSK, Italy \[Source 3\], collated feedback from the presentation, which included the following: 

 “The analysis of causes of success and failures for the presented cases \[Output 4 and 5\] was particularly relevant to the audience and eye\-opening at the same time: the presentation triggered a lot of questions and reflections among the attendees”. 

 After the dissemination, Shirley Pullan, Strategic Partners & Resourcing Strategy Manager, GSK Belgium stated: “I believe it really cemented for our internal customers, the importance of relationship building. A message that we state repeatedly but often is not heard” \[Source 4\] *.*

 Th3rdcurve are a consultancy to the project controls and PM professions, advising the leading programmes organisations and governments on their PM approaches.  The th3rdcurve have used the CURED framework and its underpinning research as the basis for developing a consultancy offering targeted at the clinical trial sector.  They have invested significant resources into developing a five stage process involving 1\) health\-check 2\) diagnosis 3\) treatment 4\) care and 5\) immunity that operationalises the CURED capability nodes \(Outputs 4 and 5\) to provide insight into PM performance, benchmarking data similar projects and evidence of growth in PM maturity. 

 “The CURED research represents a step change in the way th3rdcurve will realise true business capability for our clients. Working in partnership with LJMU has allowed us to codify impact into our future and we will continue to work closely with David \[Prof Bryde\] and the team in 2020” *.* Simon Taylor, Founder and COO, th3rdcurve.co.uk \[Source 5\].

 Between 1<sup>st</sup> September 2013 and 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020, R&R Consulting used Outputs 1 – 5 to design and deliver unique and differentiated research\-informed PM training offerings that proposed new and innovative approaches to the management of clinical trials. 

 As testified by R. Joby, Senior Consultant at R&R: 

 “An important part of the business conducted by R. & N.R. Consulting Ltd. is project management training. There are two courses where the research conducted by Liverpool JM University \(LJMU\) has had a major input into the content and the approach. The three\-day Project management course sponsored by the Institute of Clinical Research \(ICR\) and the two\-day courses on the successful management of CRO budgets. Both courses are run on a regular basis dictated by demand. The research on relational risk, dealing with the problems associated with principal agent theory and the development of the CURED Framework have fundamentally changed the emphasis of these courses. Whereas once these courses had their foundations in the Association for Project Management Body of Knowledge it is now firmly in the CURED framework” \[Source 6\]. 

 This focus enabled R & N. R. to secure 52 contracts, with a total contract value of 90,706 GBP with clients in France, UK, Germany, Switzerland, Russia and the US.  They delivered training to 415 delegates and the value of the training to the clients was 295,251 GBP based on daily rates per delegate charged. 

 Course feedback testifies to the significant change in knowledge, capability and behaviours i.e. the knowledge enabled the: “… improving of activities v deliverables on budgets” \[Output 1\] and “introducing new ways of tracking budgets/improve communications” \[Output 3\] \[Source 7\]. 

 **CLINICAL TRIAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT POLICY AND PRACTICE**

 In August 2019, Prof Bryde had an initial conversation with Alison Messom, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the ICR and some of the ICR staff about next steps in relation to disseminating the research. The suggestion was made in the meeting to write a Code of Practice \(CoP\) that the ICR would endorse through use of their logo and inclusion on their website.  Prof Bryde was then invited to present this proposal to members of the ICR Board in February 2020, at which point approval was given.  The CoP was developed by Prof Bryde, in collaboration with two industry practitioners: R. Joby and S. Taylor.  Titled “A code of practice to aid successful delivery of clinical research projects”, it is structured around the CURED Framework \[Outputs 4 and 5\]. The CoP was formally launched via an ICR online webinar on 8<sup>th</sup> December 2020. The ICR has over 1,000 members, all of whom are involved in the management of clinical trials, from across the globe, including UK, Europe, US and Africa. Alison Messom stated that the proposed model in the CoP provides a platform for further research which is “key to improve and benefit the successful conduct and completion of clinical trials” \[Source 8\]. 

 <ins>THE PHARMACEUTICAL CONTRACT MANAGEMENT GROUP</ins> 

 The Pharmaceutical Contract Management Group \(PCMG\) – an association with 130 named members across the spectrum of companies in Europe involved in the outsourcing management of clinical trials, testify to the impact in terms of providing practitioners with evidence to do things differently.  In the words of the Chair of the Project Management Special Interest Group of the PCMG “the work that you have been doing has encouraged smarter outsourcing but with a results\-based focus, and if outsourcing is to be credible it has to be able to deliver results.  And what you’ve provided is, it’s more than a framework, it has provided people with something to go into their management and say, look, there’s a better way of doing this” \[Source 9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The development of sporting talent is central to elite sport, and is an aim of Sport England, the Lords Olympic and Paralympic Legacy Committee, and the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Sport, but there has been a relatively impoverished understanding of what underpins the development of the world’s best sporting talent. Rees has led a number of research projects, co\-created with sporting organisations in the UK across multiple sports, which have highlighted that the key factors involved in producing elite athletes include early developmental experiences, individualised coaching, and social group membership. These insights have changed the working practices of thousands of coaches and athletes across more than 20 sports, including Olympic sports to cricket and rugby. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Tim Rees’ research centres on the development of talent in elite sport. Previously funded by UK Sport \(“The Great British Medallists Project”\) and the England and Wales Cricket Board \(The ECB: “The development and validation of a psychological profiling system for elite cricket players”\), since his arrival at BU in September 2015, he has continued to publish his research in a number of high\-impact journals. 

 The initial driver for the research was UK Sport’s desire to generate a better understanding of what underpins the development of world class sporting talent \(i.e. Gold Medal winners\). Research by Rees and research collaborators at Bangor University; the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany; the University of Queensland, Australia; Queen’s University, Canada and University College London, published in 2016 in *Sports Medicine*, found that “the task for researchers, practitioners and policy makers of generating a clear understanding of what is known and what is thought to be true regarding the development of sporting talent is particularly challenging” \[R1\]. 

 For the first time, Rees et al. provided an authoritative, balanced, comprehensive, fully referenced and critical review of the literature, which now serves as a key point of reference: \(a\) for researchers in talent identification and development in sport, as well as a guide to future research; and \(b\) for practitioners and policy makers in sport seeking an overarching, evidence\-based understanding of the current state of knowledge in the area, as well as a guide for translating that knowledge into action. This output has become the gold standard review and has, to date, been downloaded over 46,000 times \(see  [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279\-016\-0476\-2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-016-0476-2)\). 

 Subsequent research by Rees has examined distinctions between serial medalling, super\-elite athletes who have won multiple gold medals at Olympic Games or World Championships and those of matched, funded, elite athletes, who had not medalled at either a World Championship or an Olympic Games \[R2\] \[R3\]. His initial paper, \[R2\], used qualitative methods to highlight eight key aspects of the athletes’ psychosocial biographies which differentiated the two groups of athletes. His subsequent paper, \[R3\], used novel methods from bioinformatics \(pattern recognition analysis\) to indicate that a combination of psychosocial attributes, the total volume of practice plus play and physical activity discriminated between the super\-elite athletes and elite athletes with an accuracy of 97%. Overall, the results showed the importance of early developmental experiences in the production of super\-elite athletes, demonstrating the necessity of psychological screening. 

 For a sport such as cricket, there has been a lack of understanding as to how talented players can successfully transition from the county academies to the ECB’s England Development Pathway \(EDP\) and on through the U17s, U19s and into the Test side. Rees’ research has helped develop this understanding. He has highlighted the importance of group memberships and social identity for coping with transitions \[R4\], as well as demonstrating that social group memberships also enhance resilience in the face of negative performance feedback \[R5\]. Overall, the findings suggest the importance of assessing players’ group memberships and monitoring ‘at\-risk’ players who report belonging to relatively few pre\-transition groups. The work also highlights that groups are not just a context but also a critical psychological resource for athletes.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Rees’ close working relationship with UK Sport, the ECB, and England Rugby has allowed him to share his research at the very highest level of a number of sports, via Senior Management Groups, Performance Directors, and practitioners \(coaches, psychologists, physiologists, performance analysts\). Publication of the research in open access format \[e.g., R1 and R3\] has allowed the research a wide reach across physicians, sports medicine specialists, physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, team doctors and trainers alike, helping to bridge the gap between science and practice. R1 has been tweeted about by over 300 people, including Olympians, the IOC and leading sports coaches. A piece written by Rees, based on the 2016 article, has been read over 130,000 times \[E1\]. R1 has formed the backdrop for numerous other online media including the BBC and CBC \[E2\]. Further, the then Chair of the Office for Students and former Chief Adviser on Delivery to Prime Minister Tony Blair, delivered a keynote at the Sport Performance Summit in London in 2016 \[E4b\], referencing Rees’ research \[R1\], and subsequently stating that he was “struck by the similarities that I saw between these characteristics and those I had seen in top performers in government” \[E3\]. 

 The former Head of England Development Programme at England and Wales Cricket Board and subsequent Performance Director at the Lawn Tennis Association and Manchester City AFC, states that the Great British Medallists Study \[R1\-3\] is “the primary piece of empirical research that underpins talent identification, selection, confirmation, and development practice across Olympic, Paralympic and professional sport domains in the UK…Performance Directors, National Coaches and sports scientists working for more than 40 National Governing Bodies of Sport and the four home country institutes of sport have consistently used the results and conclusions from this research to inform the design and continuous improvement of the ways in which talent is defined, profiled, evaluated and understood” \[E5\]. He further notes that as a result of Rees’ research, “leaders and coaches are better equipped to understand the non\-linear nature of talent development, the management of difficult or maverick behaviour and how to maximise the likelihood of more people turning their raw potential into elite performance” \[E5\]. 

####  UK Sport 

 The research \(pre\-print versions of both R1 and R2\) was presented at UK Sport’s annual “World Class Performance Conference”, held in London in November 2015 and attended by hundreds of performance directors, managers, coaches, sports scientists, and medicine personnel.  Pre\-print iterations of R1 and R2 were used \(and continue to be used\) in strategic planning by UK Sport for the Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 Games \[E5, E6\]. Rees’ findings \[from R1 – R3\] have also been used to reshape UK Sport’s talent development pathway \[E6\]: 

-  Psychological profiling of athletes is now relatively routine. 

-  Coaches are helped to develop constructive ways to work with extreme perspective personalities. 

-  The talent data capture processes of governing bodies of sport are being upgraded to ensure that the athletes most likely to form the “super\-elite” are identified earlier. 

####  England & Wales Cricket Board and Lawn Tennis Association 

 The findings of Rees’ research into the importance of group memberships and social identity \[R4, R5\] has significantly influenced national junior player development programmes in both cricket and tennis. The former Head of the England Development Programme, England and Wales Cricket Board states that, within cricket, “Greater emphasis has been placed upon the development of training environments that provide higher levels of peer and social support whilst also enabling individuals to remain connected to wider social groups at home” \[E5\]. 

 Building on this, the Lawn Tennis Association’s \(LTA\) own player development strategy has been informed by the same research. The former Performance Director at the LTA states that: “the two new National Academies opened in September 2019 are hosted by leading schools that provide access to a wider social setting and peer group. Equal emphasis is placed on personal, social and academic development as tennis skills and game style. The National Academies invest significant time and effort to integrate players into the wider school and local community whilst also maintaining contact with family and friends at home” \[E5\]. Overall, the research has impacted on the journeys into and through talent development programmes of more than 2,000 high potential young athletes \[E5\]. 

####  England Rugby 

 The former Lead for Psychology: International Performance Department at England Rugby states that “Professor Tim Rees’s research has changed the way we think about the development of elite sporting talent” \[E7\]. As a result of Rees’ emphasis on the importance of developmental experiences and psychological screening of young athletes \[R2, R3\], England Rugby now routinely engages in psychological profiling and monitors player dropout and de\-selection for possible re\-entry of players into England Rugby’s talent system \[E6\]. The continued influence of this work led to the formation of a Board to oversee further development of the ideas. The former UK Sport Head of Research and Innovation, and subsequent England Rugby Athletic Performance Manager, Head of Performance at Team Sky and now Director of Sport at Millfield School stated: “The knowledge gained from exposure to Rees’ research remains part of my day\-to\-day thinking and influences my practice in the way we support and develop young talent” \[E6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Around 5 million complaints are made about UK public services annually. Gill’s research has identified harms, such as reduced performance and wellbeing, caused to public sector employees through certain complaint processes, and recommended improved procedures. In collaboration with practitioners, Gill’s research has informed ombudsman policy and complaint handling practice in Scotland, at UK\-level, and internationally \(e.g. through the introduction of new model complaints processes\). Research\-based guidance has been implemented by organisations that deal with complaints \(e.g. Castle Rock Edinvar Housing Association\) and underpinned practice change. The research has informed the practice of ombudsman organisations internationally \(e.g. in Ireland, Canada and Australia\) and been actively promoted by the International Ombudsman Institute. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Government policy throughout the UK has encouraged the development of complaint systems to create more customer\-focused public services. This has led to the growth of a “redress industry”, costing around GBP1.5 billion a year and employing approximately 9,390 staff in UK central government alone. However, there is widespread evidence that complaint systems are neither meeting citizens’ expectations nor being used to improve public services. Evidence from healthcare also indicates that complaints can result in harmful effects on the health, wellbeing, and performance of staff. 

  

 Gill led a project \(in collaboration with colleagues from Queen Margaret University, the University of the West of Scotland and the Office of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman\) that addressed these issues by examining the effects of complaint systems on public sector employees. The research involved an online survey with 132 participants and 16 follow\-up interviews with employees working in Scottish housing associations and local authority planning departments who had been subject to a complaint **\[O1\]\[O2\]**. Gill’s unique contribution to this work included the research design, the supervision of data collection and qualitative data analysis. He was also lead author of the resultant outputs. 

  

 The research found that complaints have a significant effect on employees’ wellbeing and work practice. 14.5% of respondents reported being affected “a great deal” by a complaint, while 56.5% reported being “somewhat” affected. Most respondents \(75.2%\) reported at least some negative effects on work practice, such as wariness in dealing with service users \(66.1%\) and frequently double\-checking work \(31.5%\). 84.4% of respondents reported their health and wellbeing being affected, including feeling stressed, anxious, unwell, and undermined. 

  

 The research revealed that the operation of complaint processes was important in terms of ensuring that positive effects of being subject to a complaint were maximised. It found that negative effects could be minimised by providing opportunities for employees’ views to be heard, being kept informed of progress, being involved in the investigation, and being given clear and timely information about outcomes. Following this research, Gill and Hirst \(an independent researcher who was engaged by the Unit of Assessment as a consultant\) developed guidelines to disseminate the findings to organisations dealing with complaints **\[O3\]**. The guidelines set out research\-based principles regarding how staff subject to a complaint should be dealt with by their employer organisation, including fairness, transparency, confidentiality, and efficiency. The guidelines explain how organisations can amend their complaint procedures to make sure employees are given an opportunity to be heard, are informed of outcomes, and are provided with timely information.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1. Shaping ombudsman policy in the UK and internationally** 

 Gill’s research has informed the policy development of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman \(SPSO\), the body that provides final determinations of complaints about devolved public services \(e.g. healthcare, housing, and education\). The research was designed in consultation with the SPSO and one of its key objectives was to provide evidence to allow them to revise guidance for Scottish public service providers. In 2017, the SPSO published a thematic report **\[E1\]**, designed to draw attention to the fact that complaints systems had to work “for everyone”, including those complained about, a perspective which was often overlooked by governments pursuing a customer\-focused approach to public services. The report drew directly on the interim findings of the project **\[O1\]**. A key message was that organisations need to actively support their staff through complaints processes and engage staff in positive and purposeful activities to manage and learn from complaints. The thematic report and the report of interim research findings were jointly launched at a conference co\-organised by Gill and the SPSO in December 2017, attended by 91 public sector practitioners. The research was further disseminated through a series of posts on the UK Administrative Justice blog and   the Ombudsman Association blog \(sent to over 100 complaint handling organisations\) **\[E2\]**. 

  

 The research has also had a significant impact on the processes, training, policy development, awareness raising, and strategy of the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission \(SLCC\). The SLCC is the ombudsman for complaints about legal services providers in Scotland and oversees approximately 11,000 Scottish solicitors. It has used the research as part of its work raising awareness of complaints, referring to the research in its newsletter and in a *Scotsman* article **\[E3a\]\[E4\]**. The research has also been used to amend the SLCC’s processes, taking more immediate triage decisions on some cases to reduce the burden on lawyers and attempting earlier telephone contact with lawyers to offer a more empathetic approach. The SLCC used the research to amend its staff training, with updated training on the referral service available to lawyers facing stress due to a complaint, and amended its ‘reasonable adjustment’ training to ensure it reflected adjustments for lawyers, as well as the complainer. Finally, the research has influenced the SLCC’s strategy and its attempts to influence the Scottish Government’s legislative reform, by emphasising that the complaints system had to work for practitioners as well as consumers, with the SLCC’s CEO commenting that Gill’s research “has fed into most of our major work streams, and has influenced both policy and practice” **\[E3b\]**. 

  

 In addition to shaping ombudsman policy in Scotland, the research has shaped debate and policy in the UK and international ombudsman community. Gill has actively collaborated with practitioners to implement the research findings. For example, 13 UK ombudsman offices took part in a consultation on the research\-based guidance **\[O3\]**. Consultation responses revealed consensus among respondents about the importance of the research and the value of supporting those complained about. The research has informed an increased emphasis in the ombudsman community on the emotional and wellbeing costs of complaint systems: the CEO of the Ombudsman Association noted that members have “been actively involved in the process of developing guidance for practitioners based on \[Gill’s\] research” **\[E5\]**. More widely, the International Ombudsman Institute \(IOI\) has promoted the research to its 198 members, with the IOI’s President describing Gill’s research as “fill\[ing\] an important gap in relation to current complaint handling practice” **\[E6\]**. The research has helped shape policy debates within the IOI, as well as being used directly to inform guidance provided by ombudsman offices in Ireland, Australia, and Canada \(as outlined in section **4.2** below\). 

  

 **4.2. Shaping ombudsman and complaint handling practice** 

 Gill’s research is being used by ombudsman organisations in the UK and internationally to provide guidance to public service providers in relation to complaint handling. 

  

 The SPSO issues mandatory guidance—model complaint handling procedures \(CHPs\)—to all Scottish public service providers. These are issued to over 976 organisations—such as local authorities, housing associations, universities, colleges, and the NHS—employing approximately 500,400 staff. Revised model CHPs **\[E7a\]** were published in January 2020 and were shaped by Gill’s research \(confirmed in a letter from the SPSO’s Head of Improvement, Standards and Engagement **\[E7b\]**\). They draw on the research **\[O1\]\[O2\]** as evidence of the need for public service providers to do more to minimise the negative effects of complaints on employees and draw on the guidelines produced by Gill and Hirst **\[O3\]** \(e.g. new requirements on public service providers in relation to supporting staff through the complaint process \(at paras 48−49 of **\[E7a\]**\)\). 

 Gill’s research has also been used by the UK’s public services ombudsman, the Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman \(PHSO\), which oversees the English NHS in its work developing the Complaints Standards Framework \(a set of standards for complaint handling in the NHS in England\). The NHS in England employs around 1.5 million people and is one of the world’s largest single employers. Gill met with staff leading the Framework’s development on 10 July 2019 and presented the research to the Framework’s working group on 16 January 2020. The Framework has been published in draft for consultation **\[E8a\]** and when published in early 2021 will be used as a standard by auditors/regulators and as authoritative guidance for the English NHS. The direct relevance of Gill’s work to the Ombudsman’s work on improving complaints handling is confirmed in a letter **\[E8b\]**. The Framework draws upon Gill’s research by explicitly referring to the need to provide support for staff who have been complained about, for example, through being signposted to sources of advice \(p.9\), making sure staff are given equal opportunities to contribute and information about processes and timescales \(p.10\), and supporting staff to learn when mistakes have been made \(p.11\) **\[E8c\]**. The Ombudsman’s report explaining the need for the Framework **\[E8d\]** directly cites Gill’s research \(e.g. paragraphs 1.42, 1.45, and 1.46\). 

  

 The research is being used in a similar way by international ombudsman offices. The Ombudsman for Ireland is using the research to provide advice to public service providers \(confirmed in a letter from the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner for Ireland **\[E6\]**\). In Canada, the British Columbian ombudsperson is using the guidance in its training workshops for public service staff and in webinars for public service complaint handlers \(confirmed by the Office of the Ombudsperson’s webinar **\[E9a\]**\) and has also made reference to the research in its complaint guide for public service providers \(confirmed in a letter from the Office **\[E9b\]**\). In Australia, the New South Wales Ombudsman has used the research to inform its approach to investigations, which were seen as not providing enough support for witnesses and those subject to investigation \(confirmed in a letter from the Ombudsman’s Manager  Investigations **\[E10\]**\). 

  

 **4.3. Implementation case study and training for organisations that deal with complaints** 

 From 2018 onwards, Castle Rock Edinvar Housing Association \(one of the UK’s largest housing groups\) agreed to act as a case study for implementing the research findings and research\-based guidance. This has been incorporated through revised policies and training workshops delivered to staff. Follow\-up individual and group discussions with staff found that the introduction of the research\-based guidance resulted in staff having more say in how a complaint about them was dealt with and managers feeling more confident in what to do and say. Other significant changes include reference to handling complaints being included in all job descriptions and the research\-based guidance being referenced during induction training for all new staff \(confirmed by Edinvar case study **\[E11a\]** and the letter from Edinvar **\[E11b\]**\). The findings of this implementation case study were shared by  [Gill](https://www.spso.org.uk/sites/spso/files/Training2018/SupportingStaff.pdf) and  [Castlerock Edinvar](https://www.spso.org.uk/sites/spso/files/Training2018/SupportingStaff.pdf) at the SPSO’s Complaint Improvement Conference in Edinburgh on 25 February 2020, attended by over 220 public service employees. 

  

 Gill and Hirst have delivered an extensive series of training workshops to a wide variety of organisations during the REF period, for example, to: 40 Canadian public servants \(September 2018\); 20 education staff members, Colleges Development Network \(October 2018\); 30 public sector employees, Holyrood Complaints Handling Conference \(February 2019\); 80 public service complaint managers, Cross\-Government Complaints Forum \(March 2019\); 15 senior managers, NHS Lothian Clinical Directors’ Day \(March 2019\); 21 members of the Professional Association Research Network \(April 2019\); 100 healthcare staff at NHS Warwickshire and Coventry Trust \(May 2019\); 18 delegates, NHS Complaints Managers Conference \(May 2019\); 60 delegates, the College of Mediators Conference \(June 2019\); 13 members of the Local Authority National Complaint Managers Group \(June 2019\); 45 delegates, Scottish Federation of Housing Associations Housing Management Conference \(September 2019\); 16 delegates, Royal College of General Practitioners Wellbeing Conference \(September 2019\); 220 public service staff, SPSO Complaint Improvement Conference \(February 2020\). 

  

 Where practicable \(in five workshops\), feedback was collected from attendees **\[E12\]**, which confirmed that the research would influence practice. For example, following workshops delivered to the Cross\-Government Complaints Forum in March 2019, participants fed back that the research and guidance had been influential, as confirmed in a statement from the Forum’s Chair **\[E13\]**. Examples of feedback from participants included: “Highlighted an area we need to do more about… already instigated a review of our guidance”; “I will propose that it \[the research\-based guidance\] is adopted as policy”. In addition, a follow\-up email was sent to participants between 3 to 12 months after the training asking whether the research had changed their practice. Organisations who responded \(including the Department for Work and Pensions, the Environment Agency, NHS Lanarkshire, and NHS Lothian\) reported significant changes resulting from the research. These included: personal complaint practice changed, with increased sensitivity to the wellbeing of staff; complaint process reviewed and amended, and, research and guidance shared with complaint handling practitioners to raise awareness  \(confirmed in collated emails from workshop participants **\[E14\]**\). The National Complaint Managers’ Group provided further evidence of changed practice, confirming that, “Social care complaint managers now have a greater awareness of the needs of those who have been complained about ... Dr Gill’s research has provided an important evidence base for changes to practice” **\[E15\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Dr Shaowei He’s** research on the rise of Chinese businesses and their relationship with overseas partners has shaped the engagement practices and policies of United Kingdom \(UK\) local authorities and businesses. It has enabled them to navigate the complex cross\-border partnership working process, which has resulted in stronger collaborations with their Chinese partners. In particular, his research has prompted reflections and changes among China engagement practitioners on how to forge long\-term successful relationships with China. This has involved working with UK members of parliament, local authorities and businesses and resulted in stronger business collaboration between the UK and Chinese regions. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The China and Emerging Economics Centre \(CEEC\) at the University of Northampton is an interdisciplinary research group that focusses on the global impact of emerging economics and their relationship to the UK. **He’s** research is central to this focussing on the rise of Chinese firms and their impact on global business in the UK, as well as the underlying political, institutional and social factors that govern their relationships with international partners. 

 In an interdisciplinary study supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, **He** and colleagues examined the speed and scale of the rise of innovative Chinese firms and resultant impact on global value chains and global economic organisation **\[3.1\]**. This study shed light on the importance of Chinese companies’ leadership in global business, the nature of governance in Chinese businesses led global value chains and opportunities associated with their overseas investment. **He** and co\-authors have challenged the misconceptions that Chinese firms do not innovate and that their competitive advantages are mainly explained by cheap labour and a favourable monopoly position in their home market **\[3.2\]**. This study argued for the importance of recognising innovative capabilities in explaining the rapid rise and internationalisation of Chinese businesses. The research indicates that the UK government businesses who receive investment from China, need to look beyond immediate financial investment gains and focus on mutual benefits in innovation. 

 **He**’s Leverhulme/British Academy funded project, *Emerging economy multinational enterprises’ acquisitions in developed countries and capability upgrading in their acquired firms: a multiple case study in the UK*, explored mutual learning and power relationships between Chinese parent firms and their acquired British subsidiaries **\[3.3\]**. The research found that Chinese investing firms could offer new knowledge and learning opportunities leading to further innovation in the British subsidiaries that they had invested in. The research also highlighted that, in order to maximise transnational knowledge exchange, it is important to take account of the speciﬁcity of power relationships and characteristics alongside the power sources of partners. The research concluded that UK governments and businesses need to better understand power relationships between partners in order to maximise the benefits of transnational exchanges with China. 

 **He**’s research indicates that to effectively do business and engage with China, it is important to carefully consider: 

1.  the changing Chinese business landscape and its global impact as well as the underlying political and economic driving forces in order to achieve a better understanding of the context of engaging with China **\[3.1 and 3.2\]**; 

1.  Chinese firms’ innovative capabilities in order to achieve a better understanding of opportunities and benefits of engaging with China **\[3.2 and 3.3\]**; 

1.  power relationships in cross\-border partnerships in order to maximise the benefits of engaging with China **\[3.3 and 3.4\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 There has been growing interests among UK local authorities and their local communities to increase business and engage with China post\-Brexit. **He**’s research findings on the scale, nature and impact of the rise of innovative Chinese enterprises and their complex power relationships in cross\-border partnership working has helped UK local authorities and businesses in their overall engagement with Chinese Businesses. This has enabled key stakeholders to better understand the context and practice of working effectively with Chinese businesses and has resulted in stronger collaboration between the UK and Chinese regions. 

 **Reflections and changes amongst China engagement practitioners:** 

 **He**’s research on the opportunities and complexity of China engagement was presented to the general public via publication in media and professional magazines and to a range of local community and businesses leaders in the UK, including council leaders, senior managers of universities, CEOs of advanced manufacturing firms and trade associations, via a series of workshops and webinars. For example, **He** and the CEEC organised the 1st and 2nd Northampton – China Forum in 2016 and 2020 respectively.  The Deputy Leader of Northamptonshire County Council \(NCC\) stated that the events offered an ‘opportunity to discuss in a commercial perspective, Chinese relations’; the ‘genuinely interesting’ event enriched participant’s understanding of ‘the relationship structures respected by the Chinese’, which enabled a ‘greater focus on successful long\-term partnerships’ **\[5.1\]**. The Director of the Arc Universities Group \(AUG\) noted that **He**’s ‘strong, methodical stance and . . .  cultural sensitivity to both sides’ had ‘incredible power’ in facilitating a stronger UK\-China relationship **\[5.2\]**.  This was corroborated by the leader of the Northampton Borough Council \(NBC\) who stated that **He**’s work has resulted in an increase in understanding of ‘how the good foundation of building any sort of partnership is to establish some sort of local government relationship first’ **\[5.3\]**. In November 2020, based on **He**’s research and extensive knowledge of Chinese firms and his in\-depth case study of Chinese acquisitions in the UK, the House of Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee invited him to provide evidence to the Parliament inquiry into foreign investment into UK companies, contributing to the debate on scrutiny of foreign investment and Britain’s relationship with China **\[5.4\]**. 

 **He’s** research has significantly improved UK practitioners’ understanding of the complexity of engagement and their capacity to navigate through cross\-border partnership working.  This has prompted a number of actions.  For example, two local authorities have developed links with specific regions of China where they have common business interests.   After attending the 1st Northampton – China Forum, the CEO of South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership \(SEMLEP\), acknowledged **He**’s 'instrumental' role as 'unofficial ambassador' to the Hunan Province of China. **He** facilitated bringing a delegation from the region to meet with members of SEMLEP who subsequently developed and proposed a China strategy to the board **\[5.5\]**. Additionally, as a result of **He**’s work, both Lincolnshire County Council \(LCC\) and NBC have signed agreements with their Chinese partner regions, paving the way for closer regional collaboration as detailed below **\[5.3; 5.6\].** 

 **Enhanced business collaboration between UK and Chinese regions** 

 **He**’s research on China’s business landscape and Chinese firm’s innovation capabilities has informed a regional and sectoral focused approach in UK local authorities’ collaboration with Chinese partners. With his knowledge of the political, cultural and power factors in cross\-border partnership working, **He** has further guided relationship building between UK local authorities and their Chinese partners, which has led to stronger cross\-border business collaboration. 

 **Establishing new Relationships between Lincolnshire and Hunan** 

 Working with Lincolnshire County Council \(LCC\), **He** identified Hunan Province of China \(with nearly 70,000,000 population\) as an area of strategic focus. In 2015, he brought a senior Hunan government delegation to visit Lincolnshire. This resulted in a Memorandum of Understanding between the two regions to facilitate cross\-border civic, cultural, business and educational exchanges. This subsequently led to the signing of a formal Sister Region Agreement in 2018 **\[5.7\]**. Given the decisive role of the state in China’s economic and social development, this formal agreement presents one of the most significant steps in regional collaboration between Lincolnshire and Hunan. According to the leader of LCC, this formal relationship with Hunan “gives Lincolnshire much greater access to one of the largest and most important export markets in the world with huge potential for economic growth” **\[5.6\]**. 

 LCC recognised the importance of **He**’s research\-based advice and his essential role in ‘forging an economic sister relationship with Hunan province’ **\[5.6\]**. **He** was critical in initiating and strengthening the Hunan\-Lincolnshire relationship, which, according to LCC’s Assistant Director for Growth, has ‘helped to drive forward’: 

-  business to business contact between the two regions, including several new contracts being signed by businesses from both sides 

-  development of academic linkages, including student and lecturer exchanges between universities in both areas 

-  and attraction of government funding to explore food technology relationships, in terms of joint research and business relocation **\[5.6\]**. 

 The Deputy Director General of the Foreign Affairs Office of Hunan Province stated that insights from **He**’s research led to the ‘quick identification of strategic focus on three sectors where the two regions have world class characteristics: Agri\-tech, Advanced Manufacturing and Education’ **\[5.7\]**. This has increased the number of business, civic and cultural exchanges between Lincolnshire and Hunan, contributing to, for example: 

-  a 112% increase in Hunan’s trade with the UK in 2019, amounting to USD1,400,000,000 **\[5.7\]**; and 

-  the opening of direct flights between Changsha \(capital of Hunan\) and London in 2018, which witnessed passenger number exceeding 43,000 in 2019 **\[5.7\]**. 

 Building on this momentum, the Midlands Engine, which covers a population of 11,500,000 and 10 Local Enterprise Partnerships including Greater Lincolnshire, signed a strategic partnership agreement with Hunan in 2019. This effectively enabled the Midlands Engine region to access one of the fastest growing regions of China. According to the Deputy Director General of the Foreign Affairs Office of Hunan Province, this has also created a ‘springboard for \[Hunan’s\] wider collaboration with the UK’ **\[5.7\]**; the Chairman of Midlands Engine has concurred, stating that, the agreement with Hunan has established a strong foundation to “bring about further similar successes across the entire Midlands region” **\[5.8\]**. 

 **Creating the foundation for relationships between China and Northampton** 

 Given the sheer scale and complexity of the Chinese business landscape, both Northamptonshire County Council \(NCC\) and Northampton Borough Council \(NBC\) have adopted **He**’s recommendation to target Chinese selected cities and regions that have complementary capabilities in developing common strategic industries and innovation collaboration **\[5.3\]**. This led both NCC and NBC to focus on Hunan, Hubei \(nearly 60,000,000 population\) and Liaoning \(45,000,000 population\). 

 As part of the region’s wider China engagement, in 2018 CEEC signed an MOU with Silverstone Circuits Ltd. to develop further partnerships. The then Head of Partnership of the company commented that the ‘university has helped not only Silverstone Circuit but also the wider Northants community to both identify opportunities and ensure that ongoing dialogue is conducted effectively and in a culturally respectable manner” between local businesses and their Chinese counterparts. **\[5.9\]**. 

 In October 2018, the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, invited **He** to organise and lead a delegation of leaders from Northamptonshire’s civic, university and business communities to the 4<sup>th</sup> UK\-China Regional Leader’s Summit in China. This enabled Northamptonshire community leaders to closely engage with their counterparts in Dalian and Liaoning, the host city and province of the Summit. Indeed, with **He**’s facilitation, NBC and Dalian Municipal Government signed an MOU at the Summit to develop a formal sister\-city relationship **\[5.9\]**. The leader of NBC noted that **He**’s work has led to ‘a form of partnership with a couple of different places and some further opportunities to explore’ **\[5.3\]**. This was supported by the ‘level of knowledge, the understanding of who to be talking to and then making all of that happen, which has been delivered by \[ **He**\] through CEEC’, which led, ‘without a doubt’, to the council’s subsequent work with China. This has established ‘a very solid foundation’ for the council to further develop these relationships **\[5.3\]**. Indeed, with **He’s** direct facilitation and advice, in the last few years Northamptonshire hosted business tours for the former and current Minister Counsellors of the Chinese Embassy and delegations from Hunan, Liaoning, Dalian and Nanjing, laying good foundations for further collaboration with China. These visits were particularly essential in helping businesses in the local community to understand the Chinese business landscape, opportunities for working with China and the relational aspects in cross\-border partnership working. The CEO of Silverstone Technology Cluster \(STC\) confirmed that **He**’s ‘tireless efforts to create or participate with various China\-focused events have had a really positive impact’, generating direct engagement opportunities with Chinese business delegations and bringing to the fore a lot of ‘knowledge of the marketplace and the potential opportunities that exist’ **\[5.10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 A series of **engagement and co\-production activities** raised awareness of the work of William Blake \(1757\-1827\), and **enhanced the appreciation of his relevance and importance** today. Impact was achieved locally, nationally and internationally, through events in Lincoln, London and Germany. Modes of impact incorporated **collaboration with arts and heritage sector** **professionals**, promotion of new forms of artistic expression, support of a learning society, celebration of a major literary anniversary \( *Frankenstein*\), and enhancing understanding of the cultural theme of monsters and of the contemporary issue of death. Beneficiaries comprised a number of public, professional, and third\-sector partners, and public event participants. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** – References in section 3 are indicated by number \(e.g., **R1**\) 

 New research on William Blake’s art since 2014 has focused on four perspectives: his early years, reception in Europe, influence on the artist Ludwig Meidner, and the concepts of monsters and death. Interdisciplinary explorations across these dimensions have invigorated national and international debates. 

 **Early Years** 

 The rediscovery in 2012 of Blake’s *Illustrations of the Book of Job* \(1828\) in the library of Alfred, Lord Tennyson at the Lincolnshire Archives developed into a project on Blake’s early reception. This was reflected in a number of publications and events \( **R1, R3, R6**\) and in particular, the edited collection that won the Allan Lloyd Smith Prize for Gothic Criticism \( **R5**\), as well as others \(e.g., ‘William Blake in context’ \(for the ‘Literature in context’ series, Haggarty 2019, Cambridge University Press\) and a conference paper \(Oxford\). 

 **Blake and Europe** 

 While much work has been done on Blake’s British reception, scholarly work on his European reception are only just emerging. *The Reception of William Blake in Europe* \( **R1**\) presents a comprehensive picture of the reception of Blake’s works in more than 23 European countries \(19<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> centuries\). The co\-edited two\-volume collection charting histories of discovery and identifying routes of influence is a landmark work of reference. Reviews have noted that that it: 

-  ‘gives the history and contexts of Blake’s arrival in country after country … is extraordinarily thorough in its reach … The seeds of many dissertations lie in these volumes’ \( [*Eighteenth\-Century Studies*](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/747245), 2020\); 

-  ‘performs an important task in expanding Blake’s afterlife to better encompass its true reach and complexity, and in doing so, opens up foundations for new research that will surely be built upon in many years to come’ \( *Romantik*, 2019\); 

-  ‘stands as an impressive and original contribution to Blake scholarship and will surely inspire future reception scholarship’ \( [*European Romantic Review*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10509585.2020.1775970), 2020\). 

 **Blake and Meidner** 

 In researching the reception of Blake’s art in Germany, deep affinities were discovered between Blake and Ludwig Meidner \(1884\-1966\), the German\-Jewish expressionist painter \( **R1, R2**\). This is reflected in objects, letters and diaries in archives in the UK and Germany. Meidner was aware of Blake when in Germany, but only connected with Blake’s work during his exile in London \(1939\-1953\). This relationship can also be understood in the context of a Blake revival in 1940s Britain. 

 **Monsters and Death** 

 Research investigating Blake, text\-image relationships, his reception, and connections with attitudes towards death have been reflected in **R3** and **R5**. In addition, this perspective also led to a related exploration of the concept of monsters which originated in collective work within the interdisciplinary ‘Literature and Literacies’ Research and Knowledge Exchange Unit at BGU, involving English and Education researchers in particular. Activities also extended to further collaboration with the BGU Chaplaincy, as well as the co\-produced, open\-access journal edition on the theme of ‘ [Monsters: interdisciplinary explorations in monstrosity](https://www.nature.com/collections/ffgefcehaf)’, *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* \(Springer, 2019\-2020\).

 **4. Details of the impact** – Sources in section 5 are indicated by number \(e.g., **S1**\) 

 The central theme of the impact was exploration of the diverse responses to Blake and his influence on different cultures – through literature, translation, art, exhibitions and music. This was channelled through public\-engagement events, collaborations and projects in Lincoln, elsewhere in the UK, and Germany. 

 Impact types were diverse: 

-  Collaboration with heritage/arts sectors; 

-  Inspiring/supporting new forms of artistic expression; 

-  Enhancing understanding of contemporary issues; 

-  Stimulating public interest/engagement in research; 

-  Contributing to commemoration. 

 Principal beneficiaries were: 

-  Public, professional, and third\-sector partners; 

-  Public event participants. 

 **Partnership and co\-production** 

 In 2018, there was a collaborative project with artist, Bridget Smith, for the Lincoln\-city\-wide Arts Council Funded ‘Mansions of the Future’ project. The poster on Tennyson, designed by Smith, included William Allingham’s annotation and credited both Allingham and Tennyson \( **S4**\). 

 Also in 2018, as part of the bi\-centenary of the publication of *Frankenstein*, there were the  following public engagement events: 

-  BBC Radio Lincolnshire interview; 

-  Public reading of *Frankenstein* as part of *Frankenreads* with BGU Chaplaincy; 

-  Two film screenings \(BGU Venue\), with panel discussion \(for adults, target audience\) and artistic workshop \(for children, target audience\) \( **S10**\). 

 Throughout 2019\-20, partnership with and support of The Blake Society expanded, as reflected in the organisation of: 

-  Four Society events relating to the production of *The Reception of William Blake in Europe*, attracting audiences from Brazil, Canada, USA, as well as the United Kingdom and Europe \( **S5**\); 

-  The Society’s first ZOOM event \(2020\); a creative response to contributions to *The Gothic and Death* and *Beastly Blake,* in collaboration with artist, Marina White Raven. This resulted in *The Sick Rose: Encountering William Blake,* a live performance for lockdown one:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q\_MKE4nIZew&t=38s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_MKE4nIZew&t=38s) \( **S8**\); 

-  Production of the Society’s new online magazine,  [*VALA*](https://www.blakesociety.org/vala), from 28 November 2020 \( **S5**\). 

 Throughout 2017\-20, collaboration and co\-production has been central to the BGU\-based annual public ‘Death Conferences’. The 2020 event, which included further involvement of Maria White Raven, attracted the following comment from a professional practitioner: the “skilful organisation and caring facilitation opened up space to network and creatively explore that which is often taboo.  As someone from a health background I learned that death and dying crosses disciplines and professions.  There are many, unique perspectives to learn from and huge potential to grow and work together” \( **S9**\). 

 The Death Conferences, 2017\-20, together with exploration of the theme of monsters, has extended to further engagement with Lincoln Cathedral, as reflected in various contributions \( **S7, S10**\): 

-  Displays on death and monsters, the Wren Library: ‘A wonderful exhibition of these terrible monsters’ \(Visitor Book comment\); 

-  Dragon Trail; 

-  Monster Wow Day; 

-  Monster Story\-telling events.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UK policymakers, practitioners and campaigners pursuing better outcomes for disadvantaged households have lacked evidence\-based criteria for addressing low income. Loughborough University’s Centre for Research in Social Policy has developed an internationally innovative method for compiling minimum household budgets based on public attitudes to necessities. The resulting ‘Minimum Income Standard’ and has guided various aspects of policy and practice in the UK, leading to the following impacts: 

 1\) **increasing pay** for 200,000 workers of 6,000 Living Wage employers throughout the UK; 

  

 2\) **targeting assistance** by guiding prioritisation of \(a\) over £20 million annually in *grants by UK charities* and \(b\) £10\-12 billion that the Scottish Government is spending improving *home energy efficiency;* and 

 3\) **improving access to justice**, by supporting a Supreme Court ruling outlawing employment tribunal fees in the UK, after which 64% more workers accessed tribunals. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Continuous research from 2006 to 2020, directed by Donald Hirsch and led by Abigail Davis and Matt Padley at CRSP, has calculated and updated the level of a Minimum Income Standard \(MIS\) **\[R1\].** The research was designed to operationalise the concept of a ‘participatory social minimum’, first articulated in the 1970s by the sociologist Peter Townsend, by producing a usable set of benchmarks based on Townsend’s principles. From the original study onwards **\[R2\]**, MIS applied a rigorous and pathbreaking ‘consensual budget standards’ method, consulting groups of members of the public about what items are needed, not just for survival but in order to participate in society. Groups draw up budget lists, costed by researchers to produce regular weekly budgets required by different household types. This allows calculation of income requirements for any household type, making it a highly practical tool in UK policy and practice. 

 After the method was established in 2008, its funder, Joseph Rowntree Foundation \(JRF\) supported ongoing research at CRSP to establish a standard that could continuously influence policy and practice. Since 2009, MIS has been updated annually, using inflation data and biannual consultations with members of the public to identify changes in household requirements as society evolves **\[R1, R3\]**. JRF also funds CRSP to support knowledge exchange partnerships helping users to benefit from MIS research. For example, CRSP has worked in partnership with bodies such as Child Poverty Action Group, Gingerbread, the Association of Charitable Organisations and the Living Wage Foundation. 

 The research has advanced academic knowledge about how the public thinks about minimum acceptable living standards **\[R3\]**, while at a practical level providing  a unique metric to apply to a range of policy\-relevant issues including the level of a living wage **\[R4\]** and additional living costs in remote areas **\[R5\]**. 

 Key findings from MIS inform efforts to tackle low income in the UK, with the following  findings particularly pertinent to the impacts identified in this Case Study: 

 Finding 1: The National Minimum Wage \(NMW\) is too low to allow most working households to reach a minimum acceptable standard of living **\[R1,R2**\]. 

 Finding 2: More than two in five children, but fewer than one in five pensioners, live in households with incomes too low to reach a minimum acceptable living standard **\[R6\]**. 

 Finding 3: In some parts of the UK, much higher costs increase the risk of having insufficient income. In remote rural Scotland, for example, costs can be 10%\-40% higher **\[R5\]**.

","
1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 MIS has become the recognised benchmark across the four nations of the UK of how much people need for an acceptable living standard. Its authority derives both from the quality of the research and from the ubiquity of its uses, with each new application strengthening its status as a recognised standard. The MIS team have worked with a range of charitable and public bodies \(referred to below\), to show how MIS can be applied, helping them to build practical tools to pursue better outcomes for low income households. The following are key impacts it has had on pay, on financial and other assistance for low income households, and on access to justice. 

 **Impact 1: Influencing pay: adoption of the Voluntary Living Wage** 

 MIS research has provided the main component in calculating the level of the Voluntary Living Wage \(VLW\), now paid by nearly 7,000 UK employers accredited by the Living Wage Foundation, who estimate that this directly affects 250,000 workers’ pay. Throughout the 2010s, the campaign for a Living Wage has grown steadily: the campaign responded to the failure of the compulsory National Minimum Wage to provide adequate income \[R1, R2\]**, by persuading a growing number of employers to pay the higher VLW. The campaign’s leader, Matthew Bolton, stated that MIS 

 “*provided the initial rationale to go national with a campaign previously limited to London, and has been critical in making the case to employers for pay that reflects living costs*” **\[S1\]**. 

 In 2016, the independent Living Wage Commission established by Living Wage Foundation confirmed MIS as the basis for calculating a VLW that would “ *accurately reflect the views and experiences of ordinary people…about what is required to fully participate in society*” **\[S1\]**. 

 Matthew Bolton attested that since the UK Government’s compulsory ‘National Living Wage’ \(NLW\) was launched at a level below the VLW in 2016 “ *the evidence provided by MIS has been crucial in persuading employers to pay the real living wage* \[i.e. the VLW\], *by showing that the NLW is still too low to live on*.”  **\[S1\]**. 

 The VLW has benefited both employers and employees. In 2016, Cardiff Business School surveyed over 840 living wage employers, representing the full range of those accredited. High proportions of respondents reported reputational gains \(78%\), improved recruitment and retention \(over half\) and better\-quality job applicants \(45%\) as a consequence of implementing the VLW **\[S2\]**. An in\-depth, peer\-reviewed study of the impact on employees, carried out by the University of York, found that the VLW helped its recipients afford essentials. One participant stated: *“\[I\] can meet bills better . . . \[the\] extra income helps us not to worry*”. Others said it helped children participate in society, by funding after school activities **\[S3\]**. 

 **Impact 2: Targeting assistance for low income households** 

 The MIS evidence allows public and charitable bodies to ensure that both monetary and non\-monetary assistance are well\-targeted at those whose incomes fall below what they need. Two examples are charitable financial aid and help to households in improving home energy efficiency. 

  

 **\(a\) Prioritising charitable assistance based on evidence\-based income criteria** 

 The Minimum Income Standard is widely used as a criterion by charities helping households in financial need \(benevolent organisations\). A 2017 survey **\[S4\]** identified 22 charities, distributing £21 million a year to needy households. The charitable officers interviewed for the survey welcomed the evidence MIS provides that allows financial need across different types of household to be compared using a common metric. As a result, they had used it to replace previous criteria for awarding grants that had often appeared arbitrary.  For example, reflecting the research’s identification of large income shortfalls for families relative to pensioners **\[R6\]**, the ICE Benevolent Fund found that they had not adequately recognised the costs faced by young families. A caseworker from the charity states that this evidence has “… *led to the awarding of larger grants, enabling families to be able to continue with activities, particularly for their children \(e.g., after school activities\) that they might otherwise have had to stop*.” **\[S5\]**. 

 **\(b\) Reducing fuel poverty in Scotland** 

 In legislating to tackle fuel poverty, the Scottish Government \(SG\) sought an empirically grounded measure of how much money households need after paying fuel bills. Its expert panel found that MIS is the best available predictor of harm associated with low disposable income **\[S6\].** As a result, Scotland’s Fuel Poverty \(Targets, Definitions and Strategy\) Act, 2019, defines fuel poverty as having to spend at least 10% of income on home energy, and having disposable income at least 10% below MIS. The SG is committed to using this metric to ensure that the £10\-12 billion it plans to spend improving home energy efficiency from 2020 to 2040 prioritises low income households **\[S7\]**. Furthermore, as a direct result of CRSP’s evidence to the Scottish Parliament, the SG amended the legislation to set a higher income threshold in remote areas, recognising additional costs in such areas **\[R5\]** *,* and has commissioned CRSP to continue researching those costs **\[S7\].** 

 **Impact 3: Improving access to justice: Ensuring affordability of legal services for low income households** 

 The MIS research helps support the public objective of ensuring that people are not denied justice because they cannot afford legal expenses: it identifies the substantial proportion of households lacking adequate income to live on **\[R6\]**, who could not be expected to cover legal charges *.* In a landmark 2017 case, the Supreme Court accepted the argument of the trade union UNISON, based on MIS evidence, that the introduction of fees for employment tribunals was forcing low income workers to choose between accessing justice and maintaining an acceptable living standard. The Court agreed that workers were having to sacrifice ‘ordinary and reasonable expenditure’ as specified in MIS to pay fees **\[S8\]** and ordered their abolition. In the year following the judgement, 64% \(55,000\) more workers were able to take employers to tribunals **\[S9\]**. This change reversed a situation whereby low\-paid workers had been unable to get a fair hearing when in dispute with their employers: 85% of 719 employment lawyers responding to a 2015 survey said that fees had been detrimental to access to justice. One respondent elaborated: 

 “*Tribunal fees have had a devastating effect on access to justice. This is particularly so in maternity / pregnancy cases where the claimant has run out of money at the point of issuing proceedings because maternity pay has been exhausted or is on SMP. Many of the new family friendly rights will be unenforceable in practice for this reason*.” **\[S9\]** 

 Demonstrating scope for extending the reach of MIS in the legal system, the Law Society commissioned CRSP to use MIS to assess the consequences of the legal aid means test, presenting this analysis in its published submission to the Ministry of Justice’s 2018 legal aid review **\[S10\]**. The government followed this up by reviewing the level of the means test, drawing on MIS as a benchmark.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Ford at the University of Bristol has had two major impacts on protecting UK employment rights. 

 \(1\) He produced a key Report in 2016 for the TUC setting out the threat to workers’ rights from Brexit. This strongly influenced the stance of the TUC, major trade unions and the Labour Party in the Brexit referendum and demonstrably affected political debate in the media and Parliament. The Report continues to underpin the position of the TUC, Labour and major unions on Brexit and workers’ rights. 

 \(2\) Ford’s research underpinned key lines of argument advanced before the Supreme Court in the successful *UNISON* challenge to the introduction of hefty claimant fees to access employment tribunals. The Court decision has required reimbursement of up to GBP30 million in past fees and meant around 20,000 additional workers are able to bring claims each year. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Ford’s research at the University of Bristol has addressed both substantive and procedural deregulation of employment rights. His work on Brexit and labour rights was one of the most significant scholarly interventions on this issue during the Brexit debate, identifying the precise risks posed to substantive domestic labour protections by a 'hard' Brexit. It took the form of a written Advice for the Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) \[3.1\], produced between January and March 2016, drawing on many years of research in the area. It demonstrated the crucial importance of the complex array of EU laws protecting key employment rights, contrasting them with the weaker and more fragile protections in domestic law. Through an analysis of recent government policy papers and consultations, it was able to provide evidence\-based predictions of the EU law\-based rights that would be most vulnerable to being watered down in the event of Brexit, including holiday entitlements, worker health and safety and protections from some forms of discrimination. That research underpinned two further articles which analysed the issues in more detail \[3.2, 3.3\]. 

 In 2013, UNISON, the UK’s largest trade union, launched a challenge against the introduction of large fees for workers accessing employment tribunals, a form of procedural deregulation. Between February 2016 and February 2017, Ford researched and drafted the Written Case produced for the Intervenor in the Supreme Court, the Equality and Human Rights Commission \(EHRC\). \[3.4\]. There were two key elements to the research. First it analysed the correct legal test for when an interference with access to the courts would be unlawful as a matter of domestic law, EU law and under the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\); this involved extensive research into every decision of the European Court of Human Rights and European Court of Justice on court fees. The Written Case argued that, under the ECHR and EU law, an individual’s ability to pay was a relevant but not a determinative factor. Second, it analysed empirical evidence to demonstrate that tribunal fees breached the standard required by the ECHR and EU law. Ford analysed sources, such as the official tribunal statistics, large\-scale surveys of Employment Tribunal applications and empirical work on tribunal conciliation. He was assisted with the statistical analysis by Stuifzand, also of the University of Bristol. This analysis led to the striking finding that, even on the Government’s own assumptions, around <ins>18,000</ins> individuals did not bring claims each year owing to fees. 

 The UNISON challenge was successful: in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the fees were unlawful and unconstitutional. Following this judgment, Ford wrote up the research that underpinned the written Case, in an article which also considered the broader implications of the *UNISON* judgment, for a leading peer\-reviewed journal \[3.5\]. The article exposes the vulnerability of the theoretical assumptions used by the UK Government to justify fees and distils the legal principles under domestic and international law relevant to assessing whether a fees scheme is unlawful, exploring the distinction between systemic delivery of rights and individual access to the court under EU law and Article 6 ECHR. It was described by the President of the Employment Tribunals, 2014\-2020, as “ *required reading for any politician, minister, policy\-maker, civil servant and legislative draftsman concerned with protecting \(or, conversely, restricting\) access to justice in courts and tribunals*” \[5.7\]. The article explains the legal threshold any future fees scheme in employment tribunals would need to cross and how the position differs pre\- and post\-Brexit. It is therefore likely to be highly relevant to any future fees scheme. It also provides some indication of the huge importance of the *UNISON* judgment for access to justice in general.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Over the last forty years, the UK has witnessed an erosion of labour rights through national policies of substantive and procedural labour market deregulation. A key brake on that process of deregulation has been the guarantee of fundamental rights through the Council of Europe and the EU. Ford's work has been pivotal in supporting the continued role of this European 'floor of rights' in resisting substantive and procedural deregulation. First, Ford’s work had a substantial impact on the stance of the TUC \(representing 48 UK trade unions\), major trade unions and the Labour Party on the substantive deregulation of workers’ rights threatened by Brexit. Second, Ford’s research underpinned key arguments made before the Supreme Court, which successfully challenged procedural deregulation in the form of draconian Employment Tribunal fees. 

1.  **Informing political debate around Brexit and workers’ rights.** Ford’s Advice for the TUC on the substantive threat to workers’ rights from Brexit \[3.1\] directly influenced the TUC’s stance of supporting ‘Remain’ in the referendum, as reflected in the General Council Report for 2016 \[5.3\] and a letter to the Financial Times from TUC General Secretary, Frances O’Grady, the latter stating: “ *Last week the TUC published an independent legal opinion on Brexit and workers' rights ... Michael Ford QC's opinion makes it abundantly clear that no EU\-derived workplace right would be completely safe post\-Brexit*.” \[5.4\]. As O’Grady later commented: “ *The quality of the analysis contained in the opinion, combined with Professor Ford’s standing in the legal profession, ensured that the opinion carried significant weight with both journalists and policymakers*” \[5.1\]. The TUC disseminated Ford’s Advice to its member unions and referred to it in press releases, Twitter, and a video on YouTube, resulting in wide coverage in the press, including in the *Independent*, *Financial Times,* and *New Statesman* \[5.4\]. A House of Commons Library briefing paper for MPs referred to it as “ *the best discussion of the potential employment law consequences of Brexit*” and it was cited in parliamentary debates \[5.5\]. As well as the TUC and its members, it influenced the approach of the Labour Party in the referendum. As Sir Keir Starmer, now Labour Leader, then Shadow Brexit Secretary, comments: 

 “*The Advice…had a significant impact on Labour Party policy running up to the Referendum, and the warnings we issued of a potential “bonfire” of workers’ rights in the event of a leave vote. It provided the background material to substantiate that claim, and I referred to it in speeches I gave prior to the Referendum. The warnings in the Advice also prompted a Private Members’ Bill, promoted by the Labour MP Melanie Onn and supported by me, which attempted to give a measure legal protection to EU\-derived rights after Brexit, but which was predictably talked out by Conservative MPs*” \[5.2\]. 

 The Onn Bill, however, helped keep pressure on the Government on the issue and provisions protecting workers’ rights post\-Brexit were included in the Government’s original EU \(Withdrawal Agreement\) Bill in October 2019. Moreover, as promised in the revised Political Declaration between the UK and EU, the Trade Agreement between the EU and the UK reached in December 2020 \[5.6\] contains pledges ‘to strive to increase’ protection for labour rights and not to ‘weaken or reduce’ current levels of protection for labour and social rights in a manner affecting trade’ \(Article 6.2\). Subsequently, the British Government stated that it had no plans to dilute workers’ rights, post\-Brexit \[5.6\]. 

 Ford’s work continues to be seen as the key reference point for trade unions and the Labour Party on these issues. As O’Grady puts it: “ *The quality and importance of Professor Ford’s work*” means his research “ *continues to form the bedrock for TUC analysis of workplace rights in the context of the UK’s exit from the European Union*… *it is ‘regarded as the “go\-to” document for staff at all levels of the TUC, and in the wider trade union movement and beyond, when working on issues relating to Brexit and workers’ rights*” \[5.1\]. Starmer confirms that “ *Michael’s Advice remains highly relevant whenever there are policy discussions and political debates about workers’ rights after Brexit. Its high quality of analysis means it remains the key text to refer to in this area*” \[5.2\]. 

 **\(2\) Resisting procedural deregulation: protecting access to justice in the UNISON case** UNISON relied solely on EU law in the initial stage of its judicial review challenging fees of up to GBP1,200 for workers wishing to take their employers to court. However, a senior EHRC lawyer confirms that it was Ford’s submissions for the EHRC which originally argued that fees could also interfere with the right of access to a court enshrined in Article 6 of the ECHR and the analogue but undeveloped common law right \[5.7\]. These arguments in the event proved decisive before the Supreme Court \(SC\), which, in 2017, overturned three courts below, upheld the arguments and declared that employment tribunal fees were unlawful. 

 Ford’s Case for the EHRC \[3.4\] was described by a QC involved in the case as “ *of the highest quality and well\-researched, meaning that* \[its arguments\] *were particularly convincing. This proved to be especially helpful to the Claimant, UNISON, in what was a difficult case, but one of great constitutional importance*” \[5.7\]. Ford’s Case had three impacts on the way the case was reasoned and argued. First, it was a significant reason why the arguments based on the common law and Article 6 ECHR could be raised before the SC in the first place, as confirmed by lawyers for EHRC and UNISON \[5.7\]. Second, as the solicitor for UNISON explains, Ford’s arguments in the Case “ *were picked up and developed by Dinah Rose QC*”, the lawyer acting for UNISON, in her submissions to the SC \[5.7\]. 

 Third, the judgment of the SC adopted or drew on Ford’s EHRC Case in several places. For example, Lord Reed in his leading judgment drew on material in the Case at paras 42\-44 to explain the low level of awards made by Tribunals and the claims before a Tribunal that often result in nil or very low damages \(judgment, paras 31\-34\) \[5.7\]. In other places, Lord Reed’s judgment lifted material directly from the EHRC Case as follows: para. 33 of the judgment echoed para. 45 of the Case; paras 35\-37 of the judgment \(discussing the low level of tribunal awards\) is drawn from paras 47\-48 of the Case; para. 40 of the judgment, on the drop in claims of small value, largely echoes para. 44 of the Case; paras 43\-44 of the judgment, setting out how few claimants obtained remission from the fees, draws on paras 35\-36 of the Case. Moreover, in the words of the solicitor for UNISON, paras 47\-48 of the judgment, giving Lord Reed’s assessment of the ACAS valuation survey evidence on the effect of fees, “ *drew heavily”* on Ford’s Case \(paras 23\-26\) and *“formed the basis of* \[Lord Reed’s\] *second reason for holding that fees were an unlawful interference with access to justice \(judgment para. 93\)*” \[5.7\]. 

 Finally, an important section of the judgment found that the fees were in breach of Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is closely modelled on Article 6 ECHR \(paras 105\-117\). In making this finding, Lord Reed accepted the argument made in the Case at paras 8\-9 and 30\-38, also advanced by UNISON, that ability to pay was not the sole relevant factor. In particular, Lord Reed relied at para. 115 on the decision in Kniat v Poland  as demonstrating this point, which is the very case cited and explained in Ford’s Case for the EHRC at paras 9 and 30. As a senior solicitor for EHRC summarises: “ *in several respects Lord Reed in his judgment drew directly”* on arguments in the Written Case *“on the low levels of awards in the tribunal, the poor record on enforcement, the limited effect of exceptional remission and how ability to pay is not the sole relevant legal factor*” \[5.7\]. 

 The impacts of *UNISON* itself were momentous: it is generally agreed to be the most important employment law decision of the past 50 years, since it directed affected the ability to seek effective redress for almost every statutory employment right in the UK. First, all Tribunal and Appeal Tribunal fees paid from when fees were introduced on 29 July 2013 until the date of the judgment had to be repaid. These amounted to 74,000 fees repaid, at an estimated cost of GBP33 million \[5.10\]. Second, a very significant number of employment tribunal cases that had been dismissed because of non\-payment of fees were reinstated \[5.10\]. 

 Third, and most significant of all, fees ceased to be payable from the day of the SC judgment. This led directly to a dramatic increase in claims. According to the official statistics, in the three years from 2014/15 to 2016/17, when fees were payable, the mean number of single claims per year was 16,787 \(an average of 1,398 per month\). After the judgment, from August 2017 to June 2020, the average was 3,067 single claims per month – more than double \[5.8\]. Therefore, more than 20,000 workers a year now bring tribunal claims which, but for the SC judgment, would never have been brought. Fourth, the effects of the decision extend beyond employment: it is being relied on in other cases concerned with access to courts or tribunals, such as *R \(Law Society\) v Lord Chancellor* \[2018\] EWHC \(Admin\) 294 \(a challenge to restrictions on criminal legal aid\). It will constrain and guide future government policy in relation to fees and other impediments to tribunals or courts in all jurisdictions, as the former Lord Chancellor Dominic Raab explained to the Justice Committee of the House of Commons on 19 December 2017 \[5.9\]. 

 The research underpinning Ford’s Case, as summarised in output \[3.5\], was referred to by Shantha David, the solicitor for UNISON, when she gave her evidence to the House of Commons Justice Committee. Pointing out how Ford’s arguments directly resonated with Lord Reed in the Supreme Court, she said: “ *I recommend* \[his\] *article… in the Industrial Law Journal … He points to the fact that employment tribunal claims promote labour standards. In the rush to reduce costs, the Government lost sight of the benefits of individual* \[employment tribunal\] *claims as a means of promoting labour standards. Lord Reed, as you will recall, identified that as important and said that individual tribunal claims had public benefits, not just for those individuals but for society as a whole*.” \[5.9\]. David concludes that the *UNISON* decisions “ *had enormous implications for the thousands of claimants denied access to the employment tribunal because of fees, for the upholding of labour standards in all workplaces, and for impediments to access to the courts in all spheres*.” \[5.7\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The ‘Heat and the City’ project examined governance of heat decarbonisation and energy efficiency in buildings in the UK and internationally, leading to the following impact: 

1.  informing new **Scottish and UK Government heat and energy efficiency policies,** including creation of UK Government Heat Networks Delivery Unit and £320M Investment Programme; 

1.  establishing a revised statutory definition of fuel poverty in Scotland, and influencing **heat regulation** and energy planning through Scottish Government heat network legislation and proposals for new local authority statutory powers; 

1.  guiding **investment** in integrated smart local energy systems, and low carbon infrastructure, including development of UK Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund bid *Prospering from the Energy Revolution* resulting in Treasury investment of £102.5M in demonstrators. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Janette Webb and the ‘Heat and the City’ team research the governance of heat decarbonisation and energy efficiency in buildings, and development of local clean energy systems. Research encompasses five externally\-funded projects \(2010\-2020\): *Heat and the City* \(RCUK Energy Programme & Scottish Government\); *Reframing Energy Demand: Innovation for Sustainable Heat* \(EPSRC grant & ESRC Impact Acceleration Account \); *Local Engagement in UK Energy Systems* \(RCUK Energy Programme, Energy Technologies Institute & ESRC Impact Acceleration Account\); *Stratego Enhanced Heating and Cooling Plans* \(Intelligent Energy Europe & Scottish Government\) *; Evaluating Energy Efficient Scotland Pilots* \(Scottish Government ClimateXChange\) and Local and Regional Energy Systems \(UKRI/Theme 2 UK Energy Research Centre Phase 4\) *.* 

 Heat and the City gathered comparative data from UK and European financial institutions, public sector bodies, trade organisations and the third sector to inform UK\- and Scotland\-specific energy governance. From international organisations through to Glasgow households, the scale varied between projects, utilising methods combining ethnography of policy processes and business development, expert interviews, social surveys, documentary analysis and secondary analysis of public datasets. The research identified the following problems and solutions around three key areas of decarbonising heat and reducing energy demand in buildings: 

1.  The UK centralised energy system is geared towards large supply\-side businesses, marginalising local clean heat business development and limiting incentives for energy saving in buildings. The solution is to *integrate local energy* e.g. through establishment of Heat Networks Delivery Unit \(HNDU\) \(3.1, 3.2\), and develop investment models that *future\-proof* infrastructures \(3.3\). 

1.  Absence of heat network regulation in the UK leads first to uneven customer protection and pricing, further restricting sources of *affordable heating* for vulnerable consumers \(3.1, 3.4\); and second to investment risks which limit low cost capital for infrastructure. The result is ‘island’ heat network systems focused on short term financial payback, with limited carbon saving \(3.1\) In contrast, the research into regulation in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands \(3.1, 3.5\) identified: requirements on building owners to connect; consumer protection; and technical standards. The solution is *new heat network regulations* to de\-risk investment, improve technical standards, and ensure fair prices and services. The lack of investment in skills and capacities for project planning and development further constrains UK progress on heat and energy efficiency \(3.1, 3.2\). 

1.  UK local authorities and partners lack *capacities* for cross\-sector energy planning for cost and carbon efficient local integration of heat, power, transport and storage systems. The solutions are: investment in specialist expertise; and capacity building and locality scale demonstrators to increase knowledge about local energy system options, including access to data and support for business and supply chain innovation \(3.6\).

 4. Details of the impact 

 Heat and the City research has transformed UK and Scottish energy governance, across three main areas: 

-  UK and Scottish Government **policies** for energy governance, integrating local energy planning alongside the largest public investment in UK heat networks and contributing to UK Treasury guidance. 

-  Scottish Government **regulation**, by contributing first to a revised statutory definition of fuel poverty, and second to heat network regulation to de\-risk investment, increase standards and ensure fair prices. 

-  UK and Scottish Government **investment** in integrated local energy systems, particularly through capacity building, demonstrator projects and real\-time evaluation research. 

 UK Policy – Heat Policy, and Future\-Proofing infrastructure investment 

 The UK Government Department for Energy and Climate Change \(now Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\)\), after a successful bid led by BRE with the Heat and the City team as the academic partner, funded research on barriers to development of district heating networks; the report \(5.1\) integrated early findings \(3.3, 3.5\). This report’s recommendations were partially published in the UK Government Heat Strategy 2013 \(5.1\) and directly led to the decision to establish a new policy unit within UK Government in 2014. It is noted on the UK Government website that “ *Since its inception, HNDU has run 9 funding rounds – awarding £23 million in total – and is currently running Round 10. Over 250 unique projects have so far been supported across 150 local authorities""* \(5.1\). The UK Treasury used research findings \(3.3\) on future proofing infrastructure, specifically the concept of ‘passive provision’, leading to UK Treasury Supplementary Green Book guidance \(5.2\) for assessing investment in heat networks. A research case study of heat network investment \(3.3\) was included in UK Treasury Green Book supplementary advice as an exemplar for public bodies to apply \(5.2\). 

 Scottish Policy and Regulation – Fuel Poverty, Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategies and District Heating Regulation 

 The social survey research \(3.1, 3.4\) on householders in Wyndford, Glasgow, as well as comparative studies of heat as a service \(3.5\) contributed to a new definition of fuel poverty under the Fuel Poverty \(Targets, Definition and Strategy\) \(Scotland\) Act 2019. Wyndford householders lived through a major housing estate renovation and retrofit of energy efficiency and district heating. Findings formed the basis for Webb’s appointment to the Scottish Government Academic Review Panel; the Panel proposed a new definition of Fuel Poverty which Scottish Government formally accepted, and included in legislation \(5.3\). Examining dimensions of fuel poverty, findings \(3.1, 3.4\) contributed to the inclusion of principles for affordable warmth and minimum income in the new policy definition. In her letter to Professor Webb, the Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, Angela Constance, states *“Your vast experience in comparative European policy and practice for sustainable heat and energy efficiency has provided valuable input into the definition review”* \(5.4\). 

 In Scotland, proposed heat network regulation has been shaped by comparative analyses of European regulations \(3.1, 3.5\) which were part of the evidence base in Scottish Government proposals for new *Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategies \(LHEES\) and District Heating Regulations* \(5.5\). Webb and the Heat and the City team have been closely involved in policy development \(2011\-ongoing\), including through expert and technical advisory roles to Scottish Government cross\-sector Working Groups. In his letter to the 2016 Special Working Group on Regulation the Scottish Minister, Paul Wheelhouse, stated that its expertise contributed to “ *a comprehensive and insightful consultation document, which will be invaluable in informing and progressing potential legislation in this complex area”* \(5.6\). 

 The *Heat Networks \(Scotland\) Bill \(SP Bill 64\)* was introduced to Parliament on 2 March 2020. \(5.7\). The accompanying Policy Memorandum accepted the expert advice on the need for a heat supply license, and for regulation covering pricing, service and technical standards \(5.8\). Webb’s evidence relating to poor data quality on the energy performance of non\-domestic buildings was cited in the Policy Memo which refers to these “ *risks resulting in Heat Network Zones being less robust than they otherwise might be. This may increase the risk that their designation is challenged.\[…\] the Bill  will place a duty, initially, on public sector building owners to undertake an assessment of the viability of their buildings to connect to a heat network”* \(5.8 pp.11\-12\). 

 UK and Scottish Government Investment in low carbon strategies and research 

 Webb and her team’s research was a component of a body of evidence that contributed to the inclusion of low carbon principles in the decision to establish an Infrastructure Commission for Scotland. Webb was appointed to the Commission as a low carbon expert, and the new commission’s remit included low carbon investment principles for a 30\-year strategy, directly influenced by Heat and the City research \(3.1, 3.3, 3.5\): *“The Commission will provide independent, informed advice on the vision, ambition and priorities for a long\-term, 30\-year strategy for infrastructure in Scotland to meet our future economic growth and societal needs”* \(5.9\). 

 Webb was appointed Expert Adviser to UK Research and Innovation \(UKRI\) to help develop a business case to BEIS and Her Majesty’s Treasury \(HMT\) for investment in integrated local energy system demonstrators and designs, capacity building and research under the Industrial Strategy Challenge Investment fund \(ISCF\).  Webb et al’s research findings \(3.1, 3.2, 3.6\) fed into the successful bid which secured GBP102,500,000 investment from HMT into the *Prospering from the Energy Revolution* \(PFER\) challenge. Webb’s contribution was in particular on the involvement of Local Authorities as key stakeholders, and she was subsequently appointed on the Challenge Advisory Board. The Deputy Challenge Director, UKRI, said *“The most important and timely work that helped secure confidence in LA’s appetite for developing activities in local energy was research developed by ETI/UKERC \(Local Authority Engagement in UK Energy Systems; Webb, Tingey and Hawkey, 2017 \[3.2\]\) which set out which areas were engaged in the agenda to what degree, and enabled the case to be made that there were a significant number of authorities ‘running hard’ to develop local energy projects.* \(5.10\). 

 Webb has been awarded an MBE for her services to energy transition in the UK in the Queen’s Honours List \(2020\) \(5.11\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The UK’s grasslands of high nature value, including upland calcareous grassland and hay meadows, have been in serious decline for the past 60 years. Research into the impacts of management of these two grassland types at Edge Hill University has led to upland calcareous habitats being managed for invertebrate conservation for the first time. It has resulted in the extensive hay meadow restoration in North West England to incorporate landscape scale connectivity. Finally, it has contributed towards changing priorities when identifying outcomes for agri\-environment funding. The research data also provides a benchmark and target for future conservation action. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Grasslands of high nature value, including upland calcareous grassland and hay meadows, are amongst the most biodiverse habitats in Europe. The UK has a significant proportion of Europe’s upland calcareous grassland and UK hay meadows are unique in their plant composition. Post\-war agricultural intensification has resulted in the reduction and fragmentation of such grasslands. This has had various negative effects on biodiversity: i.e., in community composition, species number, genetic diversity and connectivity. These issues inspired a body of research at EHU, utilising both upland calcareous grassland and hay meadows, into the impact of current management methods, the extent of long\-term change at local and landscape scale and effective methods to restore such grasslands. The work has been led by **Prof.** **Ashton** with significant support throughout from **Dr.** **Oxbrough** and **Dr** **Powell**. The aim was to enable scientifically informed conservation of these habitats to be undertaken. 

 Natural England \(NE, the statutory conservation body\) wanted to know whether managing grassland for plant diversity has a positive effect on the biodiversity of other taxa, as is commonly assumed. This request for information formed the basis of the Upland Calcareous Grassland Project. The uniqueness of the project derived from its focus upon invertebrates. These are typically ignored in studies of conservation management impact. Using surveys of both vegetation and invertebrates, in areas of contrasting habitat and management, the project found that: low intensity sheep grazing, cattle grazing and the absence of grazing all benefit conservation, though the beneficiaries vary \(R1\); plant species composition is not a suitable proxy for carabid beetle assemblage \(R1\); non\-target habitats such as heathland and acid grasslands in the upland matrix house distinct spider assemblages each with different rare species \(R2\), while targeted habitats had distinct spider assemblages in each grazing regime \(R3\). As a whole, the research indicates that low intensity conservation grazing, in addition to no grazing, should be promoted across upland calcareous grassland landscapes to maintain habitat heterogeneity and hence biodiversity. 

 Understanding the extent of the change in hay meadows through the quarter century duration of Agri\-Environment schemes \(AES\) and assessing the effectiveness of restoration approaches, required botanical surveying and comparison with historical data \(R4\) or donor meadow data \(R6\). The study of long\-term impact of AES had been neglected, this study being timely due to likely change of AES funding.  This restoration study \(R6\) considered the rare upland meadows, most previous studies focussed upon lowlands. Distinctively, it incorporated a spatial context, assessing whether proximity to potential donor sites was a contributory factor to success. 

 The landscape connectivity work was undertaken using genetic markers on a key meadow species, *Rhinanthus minor* \(Yellow rattle; R5\) sampled from the landscape matrix in representative areas of both the uplands and lowlands. This is an insect pollinated, annual plant; characteristics that make it highly sensitive to landscape fragmentation. This addressed the gap in the understanding of how fragmentation of the UK’s grassland landscape had impacted upon meadow plant connectivity. There is no comparable study, despite such knowledge being central to implementing the shift from site specific to landscape scale conservation advocated by The Lawton Report \(2010\). 

 These studies showed that AES schemes have been largely effective in maintaining diverse plant communities over their 25\-year lifetimes, but meadow homogeneity had increased, with some loss of rare species \(R4\).  Green hay transfer is an important step in upland hay meadow restoration \(R6\) but does not yield a full complement of meadow species, with additional measures required if restored communities are to more closely resemble the reference donor sites. Proximity to other high nature value grasslands had no impact upon post restoration community composition. 

 Genetic diversity in upland and lowland regions has largely been maintained \(R5\). However, population differentiation was higher in the lowland region, implying reduced connectivity. Conservation strategies aimed at retaining connectivity should maintain large populations and also focus upon existing and additional species\-rich grassland fragments, particularly in areas of intensive land\-use.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  The conservation of Europe’s high nature value grasslands is a significant component in the maintenance and restoration of native biodiversity and landscape protection. The Edge Hill grassland research has influenced such work through dissemination, liaison and partnership between researchers, their work, and conservation practitioners, through collaboration with the relevant government body \(Natural England\), statutory and locally designated land \(National Parks, AONBs and SSSIs plus LNRs\) and NGO stakeholders \(e.g., Lancashire Wildlife Trust and the National Trust\). 

###  Alongside the peer reviewed academic output \(R1\-R6\), wider dissemination of the work amongst stakeholders and interested parties was undertaken in various ways. Edge Hill facilitated conferences and workshops \(see E1 and E2 below\). This included the Edge Hill Grassland Conservation Conference \(E1\) in 2017 which was attended by conservation practitioners from Natural England, the National Trust and the Wildlife Trust amongst other agencies; and the Bowland Meadows day in 2018 attended by landowners, land managers and conservation practitioners. Both events included lectures and field visits. A technical report emerged from the Upland Calcareous Grassland Project \(E3\) and also an article in British Wildlife magazine \(E4\). Most recently \(Nov 2020\) Natural England have agreed to publish a hay meadow conservation report based upon the Edge Hill meadows work \(E5\), though final output has been delayed by NE. Throughout the duration of the grassland work informal contact was maintained with relevant stakeholders. Cumulatively the academic output plus formal and informal dissemination improved conservation of two significant grassland types and the wider landscape in which they are found. This had impact in three areas: \(i\) changed management practices in upland calcareous grassland to ensure invertebrate species conservation; \(ii\) informed hay meadow conservation and promoted connectivity and \(iii\) farm policy change. 

### 1.  Changing management practices in upland calcareous grassland to ensure invertebrate species conservation. 

###  The UK has a significant responsibility to conserve this habitat having 22000\-25000ha of the 600 000ha in Europe. Within England this habitat is primarily in the Yorkshire Dales and east Cumbria. Significant land managers in these areas are Natural England and the National Trust. The Edge Hill upland calcareous grassland research \(R1\-R3\) led directly to changes in management practice in both of these organisations. As the site manager of the 1014ha Ingleborough NNR noted ‘Edge Hill’s research …. has enabled us to understand much better the impact of cattle/sheep grazing regimes on the vegetation and invertebrate communities. Specifically, the Edge Hill study looked at beetle and spider communities that hadn't been assessed before, which was useful because it provided benchmark data against which any management changes can be assessed.’ ‘The study is …. having an impact on the management of the reserve now and in the future’ \(E6\). 

###  With no previous work on invertebrate community composition, the project provided baseline data to serve as a reference on invertebrate species prior to management actions by Natural England managers at Ingleborough NNR \(E6\). Prior to this study, conservation management focussed entirely upon botanical diversity, the accepted view being that improving botanical diversity would enhance all other biodiversity. The discovery that this relationship is not true \(R1\) meant that invertebrate groups had to be considered separately to plants. The conservation grazier responsible for the area noted the change in focus “…your findings repeatedly crop up in the discussions that regularly take place between ourselves and the reserve staff in deciding the most appropriate grazing regime…these discussions now take more account than previously of the habitat needs of invertebrates generally….’’  At a practical level this has seen a mix of heavy, light and zero grazing to enable a more varied vegetation structure which in turn supports a wider range of invertebrates to flourish \(E7\), as was recommend by the research and wider dissemination \(E3\). Additional action has also been taken in suitable areas to plant trees to encourage permanent scrub \(E6\) which was also identified as supporting distinct spider communities and species \(R2\). These are non\-target habitats being managed for their invertebrate biodiversity for the first time. The area under this management consideration incorporates Ingleborough SSSI \(5773ha\) and Malham\-Arncliffe SSSI \(4994ha\), almost 11000ha. 

###  Following Brexit, the basis of AES is being altered. This is enshrined in the recent Agriculture Act \(2020\). AES payments, which underpin much of the grazing within the upland calcareous grassland habitat will be based upon the new Environmental Land Management \(ELM\) Scheme. This will be rolled out by DEFRA in 2024, with the government currently running tests and trials. As part of the development of the ELM scheme \(2017\-2022\) the National Trust commissioned the Yorkshire Dales Park Authority to analyse condition assessment data on priority habitats over the past decade. In an August 2020 meeting to discuss using this habitat condition research to inform the ELM scheme, the Upland Calcareous Grassland project is referenced as evidence showing that structural diversity, sampling and monitoring is key in developing conservation management strategies \(E8\). 

1.  **Hay meadow conservation and connectivity** 

###  Direct outcomes of the hay meadow research in the Bowland AONB included the 2016 restoration of upland hay meadows; New Ing Meadow SSSI \(2.04ha\) and Tarnbrook Meadow SSSI \(10.8ha\). The sites are two of the few remaining herb rich hay meadows in Lancashire. The survey data gathered to produce R4 was used as the target community \(E10\) and the restoration was undertaken by Bowland Hay Time project in collaboration with NE, using the approach analysed in R6. Subsequent assessment of the two sites, at Tarnbrook in 2018 and New Ing in 2020, outlined on the NE website \(E9\) shows that this restoration was successful, both sites now being described as ‘unfavourable\-recovering’. This is the technical term for a positive management intervention to a previously declining site. Following the species identified as absent from green hay meadow restoration activity \(R6\), plug planting was incorporated into two other meadow restoration programmes in Bowland AONB by Bowland Hay Time project \(E11\). 

###  Hay meadow restoration \(R6\) and an intention to increase meadow connectivity \(R5\) directly informed the on\-going restoration and creation of 42.6ha of species\-rich grasslands by Lancashire Wildlife Trust \(E12\) within the Wigan Greenheart landscape. This is a network of various greenspaces, canals and woodlands, many established on derelict ex\-industrial land within Wigan MBC. This area falls within the Great Manchester Wetlands locally determined Nature Improvement Area \(NIA\), these NIAs being established as a result of the Lawton report \(2010\), which advocated a move to landscape\-based conservation. Subsequent extension of the number of meadows across several sites in the Wigan Greenheart area increased the total to 70ha \(E13\). Whist a marked local increase in the habitat, it is also significant nationally, increasing the national cover of hay meadows by nearly 1%. It also contributes to local landscape grassland connectivity for plants and other taxa, in keeping with the recommendations of the Lawton report. The site manager reports \(E11\), ‘the benefits to a range of wildlife has become clear ….. increasing the abundance of hay meadows and the connectivity between them in the North West’. 

1.  **Farm policy change** 

###  Defra is considering various approaches to funding as it develops the new ELM scheme \(highlighted above\). The NT in the Yorkshire Dales is part of a Defra\-funded ELM Test Project, on the feasibility of a whole farm results\-based approaches to AES payments. Part one of the test examined upland habitats, including calcareous grassland, part two focused on pollinator habitats on enclosed upland farmland, which include hay meadows. One element of the test was to investigate whether change achieved through conservation\-focused management of habitats could be achieved within the timescales of AE management agreement periods. Based upon research expertise, notably that in R6, Ashton was commissioned as a co\-author of a literature review which assessed the timescales of habitat\-related outcomes which may be the objectives of ELM scheme funding. This review cites R1, R2, R6 and E3. The literature review was a component of the final report on the trial, submitted by the National Trust to Defra in November 2020 \(E14\). 

###  The aim of Edge Hill’s grassland research was to enable scientifically informed conservation of these habitats to be undertaken. This has been achieved though dissemination of new knowledge and resultant altered management. Additional impact is yet to come from the Nov 2020 NE publication, based entirely upon EHU meadows work, on long term change and genetic connectivity \(E5\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Over the past 20 years we have conducted research and practice development that has focused on developing theoretical frameworks, translation and implementation methods as well as tools and processes for evaluating the effectiveness of efforts to implement person\-centredness in nursing and healthcare.  The implementation of the Person\-centred Practice Framework \(PCPF\) developed because of our research has shaped nursing and healthcare developments in 22 countries.  The systematic and sustained implementation of a theory of person\-centredness in practice continues to result in significant differences in overall quality of patient experience, staff satisfaction and well\-being, as well as better workplace cultures. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The PCPF, a mid\-range theory was developed from empirical research published between 2000–2010.  This body of peer\-reviewed research and the detail of the PCPF as a theory can be found in McCormack and McCance \(2010\).  It is this body of research upon which this case study is built. Despite revisions over time, the fundamental building blocks of the framework \(the domains\), and the key elements \(the constructs\), have remained stable over time. Refinements have reflected increased engagement with person\-centred theory, its implementation in a variety of contexts and contribution of this theory to a broad agenda of person\-centred policy, education, practice and research. The PCPF is the most adopted framework for informing the development of person\-centred practices and systems among multidisciplinary and interprofessional teams internationally and has been translated into 10 languages \(c.f. Bing\-Jonsson et al 2018\) \(Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Mandarin, Slovenian, Swedish and French\) and tested in multiple healthcare contexts in 22 countries \(c.f. Gruden et al 2020\). The framework and associated tools appeal to a wide range of stakeholders.  Influential participatory research and development undertaken with international partners in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Finland, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, The Republic of Ireland, Australia, South Africa, USA and Canada has resulted in the development of six evaluation instruments *\(The Person\-centred Nursing Index; The Context Assessment Index; the Person\-centred Practice Inventory \(PCPI\) \[with versions for staff, service users and healthcare students\]\)* and one observation tool *\(The Workplace Culture Critical Analysis Tool\).* Through various implementation studies that combine the use of the PCPF with these measurement tools, we have identified key outcomes from the implementation of person\-centred practice. 

 Our collaborative research and development projects in nursing home settings have resulted in improvements to the care environment, greater resident satisfaction, improved staff well\-being, reduction in falls and reduced use of psychotropic medications \(McCormack et al 2010, Buckley et al 2014, Mekki et al 2017; Mayer et al 2020\). In acute care settings, we have produced peer\-reviewed evidence of better engagement between staff and patients as well as improved retention of staff, greater job satisfaction and staff wellbeing \(McCance et al 2008, Parlour et al 2014, Hahtela et al 2015, Laird et al 2015\). In palliative care, our systematic evaluations of practice development programmes have shown improvements in regulator quality indicators, as well as improvements to the quality of the care environment, better and more effective staff communication, increased staff development, and better retention of staff \(Yalden et al 2013, McCormack et al 2018, Haraldsdottir et al 2020\).  An international programme of work leading to the development and testing of eight person\-centred nursing key performance indicators \(KPIs\) and associated measurement tools have been tested through a series of international implementation studies in a range of clinical settings \(McCance and Wilson 2015, McCance et al 2020\). Findings from these studies confirm that using the eight KPIs generates evidence of patient experience that facilitates engagement of nurses to develop person\-centred practice, contributing to an enhanced care experience.  Our ongoing research has led to the development of the first ever Indicators for Person\-centred Healthcare Curricula \(McCormack & Dewing 2019\) that are being tested in an Erasmus\+ pan\-European curriculum development project \(Dickson et al 2020\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research highlights the importance of developing person\-centred cultures in healthcare settings for staff to ‘be the best that they can be’ so that service users can experience person\-centred care.  The PCPF is designed to articulate the relationship between care cultures and care practices to inform targeted developments in care settings that have resulted in four kinds of impact: 

1.  Enhanced Practice Experience for Service\-users and Staff 

1.  Workplace Culture Change 

1.  Quality Improvements 

1.  Transformative Learning and Development 

 **Enhanced Practice Experience for Service Users and Staff**: In the Republic of Ireland, a national programme of development was commissioned by the Health Service Executive \(HSE\) across the Irish health system \(2017\-2020\) focusing on the creation of person\-centred cultures. Two\-hundred facilitators are embedded in the health system facilitating practice change.  Impacts include changes in behaviours among participants towards more person\-centred practices \(e.g. changes to language used in practice, better staff relationships\); more effective communication in and between teams; innovations in practice such as new services and improved quality assessments from regulation authorities \( *Evidence source 1\).*  As a result of this work a ‘practical’ set of Person\-centred Principles were developed and these, along with the PCPF have been integrated into the Health Service Executive’s ‘Health Services Change Guide’\( *Evidence source 2, pages 194\-197\).* 

 **Workplace Culture Change:** Further impact from our research can be demonstrated through the international adoption of the PCPF to facilitate culture change in healthcare settings. In NSW Australia the State Health Department’s ‘Essentials of Care’ Programme uses the Framework to develop person\-centred cultures and systematically change practices, policies and systems *.* Outcomes include improved patient outcomes, increased person\-centred care, more effective partnerships with service users, increased resource efficiency, improved professionalism among nurses as evidenced through the systematic evaluation of the work in one tertiary healthcare setting \( *Evidence Source 3\)*. 

 A programme of research and development focusing on the implementation of a set of 8 person\-centred Nursing Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) by nursing teams has been implemented in the UK, Denmark, Australia and Canada.  The person\-centred KPIs are derived from the PCPF and it is the combination of the KPIs as a mechanism for evaluating person\-centred care and the use of the theory of person\-centredness to drive forward improvements in practice that maximises impact. \( *Evidence* *Source 4 **\).**  Outcomes from this work include increased staff engagement in person\-centred care, a greater focus on improving practice, and increased ability of nurses and midwives to articulate and demonstrate the positive contribution of nursing and midwifery in different settings *\(Evidence Sources 5 and 6\).* 

 **Quality Improvements:** In Austria, the framework has been used to design a model of nursing home accreditation – the first of its kind in Austria.  The accreditation model incorporates the PCPF and the implementation of the model is evaluated using the associated instruments and tools. The framework provides a basis for all care and support processes as well as for organizational, strategic and structural measures at the state level. It also provides the theoretical framework for evaluation. \( *Evidence Source 7\).* 

 As a result of our ongoing research, Health Improvement Scotland \(HIS\), in its national ‘Specialist Dementia Unit’ improvement programme has adopted the *Workplace Culture Critical Analysis Tool \(WCCAT\)* to guide observations of practice and a participatory approach to the making of quality improvements.  One such example is that of Balmore Ward, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’ *\(Evidence source 8a\)*. The work, guided by our person\-centred research has resulted in outcomes including, changes in day\-to\-day practices and relationships with residents, better engagement with carers and implementation of meaningful activities for residents \( *Evidence Source 8b\).* The WCCAT is now integrated into the Scotland\-wide ‘Specialist Dementia Unit Improvement Programme *\(Evidence source 8c\).* 

 **Transformative Learning and Development:** The PCPF forms the core theoretical basis of ‘the Leadership Development Programme in Nursing Development Units \(NDUs\)’ in Germany. One of the outcomes from implementing the Framework has been the development of a new nursing organisational system to support and help embed person\-centredness in the units. The Framework has been translated into German and a guidance book has been developed for use across the health system in the Deggendorf region of Germany.  Nurses use this guidance book to reflect on their everyday practice *\(Evidence Source 9\)*, mapping situations to the framework and keeping notes: this forms the basis of reflection rounds with the team *.* Changes to practice include better ‘knowing’ of the patient and their family, more effective patient handover reports, implementation of a new nursing organisation system and a focus on continuous quality improvement *\(Evidence Source 10\).* The processes and outcomes from this work have been integrated into bachelor of nursing education programmes in Deggendorf Institute of Technology \(academic partner for the programme\) and collaboration extended to Switzerland and Austria. 

 Overall, the reach and significance of the impact, evidenced through these impact themes, demonstrates person\-centred outcomes for service\-users, healthcare staff and health systems.

###  5. Sources to corroborate the impact 

 **Evidence 1** **The National Person\-centred Cultures Programme** brings together a collection of narratives written by participants of the national programme six\-months after they completed the 12\-month facilitator development programme.  The narratives present details of changes to structures, processes and resulting outcomes in a variety of care settings across the Irish health system. 

 **Evidence 2** is a copy of the **Irish Health Service Executive’s ‘Health Services Change Guide’**. This guide was produced by the National Quality Improvement \(QI\) Leadership Team who are responsible for the upscaling of QI activities across the health system.  The team worked with members of the national programme \(evidence 1\) to generate a set of person\-centred principles to be integrated into QI programmes.  This is evidenced in pages 194\-197 of the guide. 

 **Evidence 3 Improving patient and staff outcomes using practice development**  is a peer\-reviewed international publication by Hennessey, C.E. and Fry, M. \(2016\)  [https://doi.org/10.1108/IJHCQA\-02\-2016\-0020](https://doi.org/10.1108/IJHCQA-02-2016-0020) In this paper, the authors provide an overview of the New South Wales State ‘Essentials of Care’ programme which is modelled on the PCPF and associated measurement tools, as well as the outcomes arising from its implementation and evaluation in one of Sydney’s major tertiary healthcare facilities \(The Prince of Wales Hospital/health system\). 

 **Evidence 4 Identifying key performance indicators for nursing and midwifery care using a consensus approach** is a peer\-reviewed international publication by McCance et al \(2012\)  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365\-2702.2011.03820.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2011.03820.x) 

 The paper provides an overview of the development of the KPI as a systematic and national project. 

 **Evidence 5 and 6** **Evaluating the use of key performance indicators to evidence the patient experience and Implementing person\-centred key performance indicators to strengthen leadership in community nursing: A feasibility study** are peer\-reviewed international publications by McCance et al \(2015\)  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.12899](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.12899) and McCance et al \(2020\)  [https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13107](https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13107) These papers provide evidence of impact of the implementation of the KPIs in different care settings.  Thus importantly identifying the transferability of this body of evidence and the implementation and evaluation methodologies. 

 **Evidence 7** **Knowing the person of the resident – a theoretical framework for Person\-centred Practice in Long\-term Care \(PeoPLe**\) provides an overview of the significant work that has taken place in the region of Lower Austria to design a person\-centred approach to assuring and accrediting care home quality in that region.  Austria doesn’t have a national quality assurance and accreditation system for care homes and so this work is forming the basis for ongoing national developments. 

 **Evidence 8a, 8b, 8c** **NHS and Health Improvement Scotland policy/guidance documents** provide significant evidence of the impact of quality improvement work in specialist dementia units as part of a National Programme by Health Improvement Scotland, ‘Focus on Dementia’.  It demonstrates the processes used including the use of the observation tool, the WCCAT and together these evidence sources demonstrate outcomes for persons living with dementia, teams and cultures at local and national levels.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The University of Liverpool VISION research unit \(led by Prof Rowe\) is unique in focussing on research for post\-stroke visual impairment \(PSVI\). PSVI effects 60% of stroke survivors but has historically been under\-recognised, with poor detection and referral to eye care services, leading to restricted quality of life. UoL’s work has established incidence/prevalence rates of PSVI, essential components for vision screening, requirements for eye service provision, user\-defined impact of visual impairment, and consensus on management strategies. This has provided the underpinning evidence for present day PSVI policies, guidelines and clinical practice in the UK and internationally. This work has led to a significant change in clinical and societal recognition of PVSI, screening and services in the UK and internationally, and a doubling in stroke units including vision stroke services. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Visual impairment after stroke \(PSVI\) is common, debilitating and costly. Most stroke survivors with visual impairment report a reduction in quality of life. This is particularly true if the visual impairment is unidentified and therefore not recognised by the multi\-disciplinary team. For many stroke survivors, visual impairment results in inability or altered ability to undertake many aspects of daily activities with impact on return to work, participation in hobbies and family life, and can lead to social isolation, altered mood and depression. Wide\-ranging benefits to patients, their carers and the NHS can be achieved through early and accurate identification of PSVI and integrated screening and care services. 

 In order to improve outcomes for people with PSVI, the University of Liverpool VISION unit led by Professor Rowe, has carried out a programme of research with clinicians, stroke survivors and charities over the last decade. We have demonstrated the significant impact of visual impairment to stroke survivors and explored difficulties related to care provision through a range of studies including: systematic reviews, studies on screening, assessment, course and management of PSVI, and qualitative work exploring the impact of PSVI and unmet needs of stroke survivors. We have developed interventions and led evaluations \(10 randomised control trials/cohort studies\) addressing patient care pre and post discharge. UoL’s work has led to over 50 active NHS/academic collaborations in the delivery of multi\-site studies and the largest UK database for PSVI. 

##  Evidence synthesis: 

 UoL’s systematic reviews \(Cochrane Library/independent narrative reviews\) have examined the efficacy of screening methods \[3.1\] and effectiveness of interventions for PSVI \[3.2,  [www.cochranelibrary.com](http://www.cochranelibrary.com/)\]. All reviews found insufficient evidence for screening methods and interventions, leading to epidemiology, screening and rehabilitation research in PSVI to address these unmet needs. 

##  Epidemiology studies: 

 We recruited 915 \(VIS study\) and 1500 \(IVIS study\) patients for the world’s largest completed observation studies on PSVI \(Rowe as CI;  [https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population\-health\-sciences/staff/fiona\-rowe/](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/staff/fiona-rowe/)\). Findings consistently show lack of standardisation across services, poor detection of PSVI, poor referral and inconsistent management. 

##  Screening for PSVI: 

 Rowe designed and validated a screening form for use by the generic stroke team, which reported a 92% positive predictive value \[3.1\]. UoL’s screening form was adopted by the British and Irish Orthoptic Society \(BIOS:  [www.orthoptics.org.uk](http://www.orthoptics.org.uk/)\) and remains the national approved stroke vision screening form. We subsequently developed a visual impairment screening assessment \( *VISA*\) tool. Validation studies \[3.3\] showed VISA to be a reliable and sensitive means of screening for visual impairment in acute stroke survivors. A spin\-off screening assessment for paramedic 999 stroke call\-outs and Stroke Association 6\-month reviews evolved from VISA. We led a national team to create a stroke\-vision care pathway to pull all screening, assessment and referral aspects of care together \[3.4\]. 

##  Specialist assessment for PSVI: 

 Rowe’s clinical practice scoping surveys \[3.5\] identified a lack of standardised specialist visual assessment leading to the development of a professional body \(BIOS\) consensus statement \(led by Rowe\). We defined essential and desirable recommendations for service provision. We surveyed 548 clinical professionals \(UK\-based/international\), patients and carers to identify core outcome measures for PSVI assessment \[3.5\]. These results underpinned the professional development of care pathways in relation to screening, specialist assessment and driving \[3.4\]. 

##  Visual rehabilitation for PSVI: 

 UoL’s reviews identified considerable variability in management options. An important part of this research has been to source the best evidence\-based treatments for visual impairment. The VISION group specifically identified homonymous hemianopia \(type of visual field loss\) as a visual condition causing considerable impact to patient lives. Following a clinical trial of two interventions versus standard care \(no treatment\) a significant improvement to vision\-related quality of life for visual scanning training was reported \[3.6\]. These results have informed the development of a larger definitive trial commencing 2020, funded by Fight for Sight and the Stroke Association.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Stroke is the leading cause of disability affecting 15,000,000 globally \(World Health Organisation\). There are in excess of 100,000 new strokes per annum in the UK and 1,200,000 stroke survivors \(the Stroke Association Statistics\). Despite new onset visual impairment in 60% of cases, services and care for stroke survivors with visual impairment are limited. UoL’s research includes pioneering studies providing evidence to underpin clinical practice and the development of research studies and national guidelines \(e.g. Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party, British and Irish Orthoptic Society \(BIOS\), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network\). A key impact of the University of Liverpool VISION unit’s research has been change to clinical practice guidelines, services and education, benefitting stroke survivors and their families, orthoptists, ophthalmologists, stroke physicians, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. 

##  National and international guidelines: 

 Rowe leads the vision group for the national Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party and her research on prevalence/incidence of PSVI, assessment and management led to a fully revised, evidence\-based vision section in the 2016 National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke \[5.1\]. 

 *“Because of the case she \[Prof Rowe\] made for the first time in 2016 we included a separate section on vision in stroke.”* \(National Clinical Director for Stroke, NHS England, 2019\) \[5.2.1\]. 

 Rowe was the vision advisor on the 2013 guideline panel for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) stroke rehabilitation in adults \[5.3\], which focused on producing evidence\-based clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of NHS patient care. As a result of her involvement, NICE guidelines changed to include new recommendations on referral and management of stroke\-related vision problems. 

 Rowe’s research informed a professional body consensus statement by BIOS outlining the orthoptic staffing requirements for acute stroke units and recommendations for vision assessment and management \[5.4\]. Rowe co\-wrote the BIOS professional practice guidelines for extended clinical practice in stroke \[5.5\] documenting the essential and desirable requirements for stroke care provided by orthoptists. These documents have been used by NHS Trusts \[5.2\] to support the development of new vision stroke services and maintenance of existing services. A survey published by Rowe in 2010 found integrated stroke\-vision services had increased from 45% of units to above 80% in the prior 10 years\). 

 “*We utilised many of the studies and reviews that Prof Rowe has published in order to evidence the need for orthoptic input into the Stroke service, as part of our successful business case.”* \(Lead Stroke Orthoptist, St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust\) \[5.2.2\]. 

 We have provided the evidence underpinning incidence and prevalence figures for PSVI and the types of visual conditions that occur. UoL’s findings are cited worldwide \[5.2.10\]. 

##  Service provision and international reach: 

 The VISION unit’s research highlights the need for better identification, specialist assessment and management of PSVI. Identification of gaps in evidence led to the development of the Rowe \(VIS\) screening form, which is now routinely used by BIOS and orthoptists across the UK in their stroke services which has improved the detection of PSVI \[5.2, 5.6\]. 

 Rowe contributed to writing the BIOS stroke care pathway \[5.7\] which was changed to reflect the evidence provided by Rowe’s research and provide improved signposting for patient care. In recognition of the limited scope of the BIOS pathway to acute care, Rowe led a national team to develop a wide\-reaching process pathway to capture stroke\-vision problems at all stages from pre\-hospital care to post\-stroke community care \[5.8\]. 

 Gaps in evidence also informed the development of research commissioned by the Stroke Association, which comprehensively outlined key needs of stroke survivors with visual impairment. In this report \[5.9\] and related publications, Rowe outlined the key features of an exemplar stroke vision service, UK\-wide professional clinician responses on assessment methods, management options and information resources. In recognition of outstanding contributions to stroke and vision services, BIOS awarded Rowe a national service recognition award in 2015. 

 Assessment at 6 months post stroke is a component of the National Stroke Strategy, and visual problems now form one facet that is encompassed in such checks; for example, inclusion in the Greater Manchester Stroke Assessment Tool \(GMSAT\). This research has reach beyond the UK. For example, groups in Australia, USA, India, Norway and the Netherlands have sought to improve their screening for PSVI and are have adopted UoL’s VISA screening with language translation where needed. 

 *“I then applied for funding for a national network on vision and stroke \[now agreed NOK5,000,000, \~GBP5,000,000\]. Fiona is on the steering committee and part of some of the working groups. We are using her research to build our cases and compare findings to see if we can structure things similarly”*. \(Associate Professor, NorVIS study\) \[5.2.3\]. 

##  Resources and education: 

 Rowe is an international expert advisor for PSVI, advising BIOS, Department of Health, UK Stroke Association, and Royal National Institute for the Blind \(RNIB\). UoL’s research has been widely disseminated at RNIB and Stroke Association national education events and conferences with impact at individual practitioner level. For example, feedback from a clinician at the Northern Ireland Multi Agency Stroke Team conference in 2016: 

 “*This has changed my practice for the future by making me more aware….I was surprised to hear what a large percentage of stroke patients do have visual problems post stroke*.” \[5.2.11\] 

 Rowe has overseen the writing of Stroke Association and RNIB stroke/vision information factsheets \[5.10\] which remain key download documents from their websites. Rowe has developed a range of resources for clinical practice and for patients which are used widely \(247 department downloads; 23/06/2020\) in the NHS \( [www.vision\-research.co.uk](http://www.vision-research.co.uk/)\). 

 *“If we didn’t have access to any of Fiona’s resources, it’s quite possible that ECLO’s would not see so many patients that had had strokes, stroke survivors wouldn’t have resources specific to them, and possibly wouldn’t know that they were even there, people would slip through the net”*. \(Clinical Lead for the Eye Clinic Support Team, RNIB\) \[5.2.4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Bioenergy has significant global potential for reducing carbon emissions – but remains controversial. While 40%  of the Climate Assembly UK “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that bioenergy should contribute to how the UK reaches net zero, 36% were unsure; thinking only certain types of bioenergy should be used, coupled with robust frameworks to ensure real carbon reductions. To apply bioenergy effectively, policymakers need access to robust and relevant evidence. Aston research enables this by providing data on the efficiency, costs and carbon reduction potential of bioenergy technologies. This is synthesised and delivered to policymakers via the Aston\-led Supergen Bioenergy Hub \(SGBH\) contributing to a sustainable low\-carbon energy future. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The climate emergency requires an urgent, evidence\-based response. In 2019, the UK committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 – and bioenergy can play a key role in achieving this ambitious goal. Bioenergy provided 31% of total UK renewable electricity in 2019 \(up 6.8% on the previous year\) and sustainable bioenergy could contribute 45% of the UK’s primary energy demand without imports. 

 Aston University’s Energy and Bioproducts Research Institute \(EBRI\) plays a key role in enabling this greener energy future. EBRI is an internationally\-renowned centre of excellence for converting biomass into sustainable energy and products, using thermochemical, biological and catalytic processes. Its research is bolstered by specialist insights provided by partners and collaborators in the Aston\-based Supergen Bioenergy Hub, which is directed by Thornley and works with academia, industry, government and societal stakeholders to develop sustainable bioenergy systems that support the UK’s transition to an affordable, resilient, low\-carbon energy future. **\(Grant 1\)** 

 EBRI generates significant fundamental data through its lab\-based activities. Critically, it then converts this into performance data that represents the entire bioenergy system via its integrative expertise in process modelling, techno\-economic analysis, and life\-cycle, environmental, economic and social sustainability assessment. EBRI’s engagement and experience with industry allows it to adapt theoretical model projections and predict the performance of energy systems deployed in the real world. Crucially, through the Supergen Bioenergy Hub – and via engagement with colleagues and partners on supply chains, business models, policy, regulation and system performance – EBRI ensures that its research is relevant to and informs the policymaking community, benefitting communities globally. 

 Specifically, the Aston research which underpins the claimed impacts focuses on the following key areas: 

-  **Gasification:** Work on the conversion of biomass into a usable gas allows EBRI to assess the potential for biomass to deliver carbon reductions via the production of heat, power, fuels and energy\-intensive chemicals such as ammonia. **\(R1,R2\)** 

-  **Pyrolysis:** Work on the conversion of biomass into liquids enables the assessment of biomass liquids as a substitute for domestic and industrial heating oil. **\(R1,R2\)** 

-  **Catalysis:** Work on catalytic upgrading allows Aston to develop sustainable aviation fuels from biomass **\(R1,R2\)** 

-  **Techno\-economics:** Work on techno\-economics allows us to compare different biorefinery configurations, evaluating which designs result in economically viable business models as processes scale up in the real world **\(R3,R4, R2\)** 

-  **Life\-cycle assessment:** EBRI’s detailed study of the dynamic partition and evolution of carbon pools during biomass growth, processing, conversion and use allows us to evaluate which land\-uses, management regimes, conversion technologies and end\-uses deliver the most significant carbon savings and how those trade\-off against other sustainability impacts. **\(R5\)** 

 EBRI brings these research streams – along with those of its Supergen partners –together for policymakers in a scalable, practical and sustainable way **\(R4,R5,R6\)**.  Insights from our research outputs are synthesised into dedicated reports for, and/or commissioned by, policy makers **\(R3, R6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Aston\-led SGBH – is a partnership between universities \(e.g. Imperial College London, University of Manchester\), industry \(e.g. Drax Power, Kew Technologies\), and policy stakeholders \(Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), Department for Transport \(DfT\)\). It is the national flagship programme for UK bioenergy research. 

 Aston leads on public engagement and consequently **Thornley** addressed Climate Assembly UK on bioenergy’s role in the UK 2050 climate targets in 2020.  [Thornley](https://theconversation.com/what-is-needed-to-tackle-the-climate-emergency-and-who-is-responsible-127642) and  [Röder](https://theconversation.com/rice-growing-produces-tonnes-of-excess-straw-can-we-turn-it-into-bioenergy-121304) wrote widely\-read articles for The Conversation on bioenergy **\[S1\]** and **Thornley** has discussed the issue on BBC World Business Report \( [http://bbc.in/2UphSbu](http://bbc.in/2UphSbu); starts at 00:30\) and BBC Farming Today \(clip link  [here](https://aston.box.com/s/syu9ozz2ehbyxuvdz1w8pxi4d2b5sr4q)\) **\[S2\]**. Aston staff constituted four of the eleven contributors to the  [Supergen bioenergy comic](https://supergen-bioenergy.net/comicpdf/Bioenergy_Graphic_Novel.pdf): \(3,000 copies distributed globally at the request of research and education agencies worldwide\) a successful engagement and research dissemination tool for younger audiences **\[S3\]**. 

 However, Aston research impact goes beyond public understanding. Researchers maintain regular contact with UK government to understand their policy needs and provide scientific information so that policies are based on the latest evidence. Research is developed by Aston and SGBH partners, but Aston collates, synthesizes and communicates the outputs, transforming them into “policy\-maker friendly” material addressing UK government’s key bioenergy questions. The figure below demonstrates typically four interactions with seven relevant government departments every month in 2020. 



 The direct beneficiaries of the research are the UK government departments charged with transforming climate and renewable energy targets into workable policies. 

 Aston has carried out extensive work on process modelling, life\-cycle assessment and techno\-economic assessment of bioenergy systems, providing a wealth of published data on typical performance, environmental and economic impacts, and costs. 

 BEIS Head of Bioenergy and Land\-Use Science notes Thornley has: 

 “provided … evidence that has enabled BEIS analysts to model pathways for future bioenergy technologies such as gasification, which has enabled HMG to commit to net zero by identifying technologies that deliver negative emissions” “improving confidence that delivering net zero is technically feasible if not straightforward.” **\[S4\]** 

 The \[text removed for publication\] notes that Aston has: 

 “provided academic research evidence \(via several meetings, seminars and exchanges of documents\) to evidence and substantiate identified areas where there was potential for enhanced carbon savings “ and  “enabled the department to, identify and fill gaps in our knowledge and establish the basis for policy development and deployment that will contribute to achieving ‘Net Zero’ by 2050 *.*” **\[S5\]** 

 Aston has helped inform government\-commissioned research and studies by working with government departments to synthesise existing knowledge and identify future prospects and gaps/innovation needs that are impeding progress. It is a collaborative process whereby these beneficiaries help to drive the research agenda. Our research provides policymakers with initial performance data sets. 

 A 2019 SGBH policy briefing on UK biomass resource and potential initiated by Aston led to an invitation to present our research to a Cross\-Government Working Group on Bioenergy. After subsequent collaborative discussions, government departments identified to us several areas of information deficit, including the total availability of biomass resource and the ability to adequately forecast it. To address this, policymakers commissioned Supergen to produce a report **\[S7\],** co\-authored by Aston staff. The report was presented to and discussed with the commissioning departments and provided them with evidence of bioenergy’s potential and the associated knowledge gaps. \[Text removed for publication\] confirm this: 

 “provided vital corroboration of the knowledge gap pertaining at that point in time, which helped staff to develop the scope of a new piece of work now being pursued by government as part of the Biomass Strategy announced in the 2020 Energy White Paper.” **\[S5\]** 

 and BEIS note our work: 

 “enabled them to progress with internal cases for a fully\-resourced review of the existing Bioenergy Strategy – and this major policy initiative will now be carried out by a team in BEIS. Aston is liaising with the policy leads to provide input data, steering guidance and specialist advice.”  **\[S4\]** 

 Our completed assessments of cost, deployment and carbon reduction potential enable government officials to appropriately scope the scale of government targets, establish the relevant mechanisms and calculation methodologies.  Through this evidence\-based approach, the public also benefit from improved global climate protection and carbon reduction. 

 In 2019, Thornley also chaired the advisory board for the Committee on Climate Change’s Biomass Report \(see above\) that’s recommendations on global bioeconomy strategy, land\-use strategy, aviation and bioproducts are now being picked up in the forthcoming Biomass Strategy. **\[S6\]** 

 Bioenergy is an SME dominated landscape and trade associations are vital to mobilize commercial interests in the sector. Aston staff \( **Thornley, Röder, Chong**\) contributed to the Renewable Energy Association’s biomass strategy steering group helping to set the direction and aims of the report **\[S8\].** The REA chief executive notes: 

 “Supergen’s involvement proved invaluable during the development of the REA’s Bioenergy Strategy, strengthening the credibility and influence of the report” and that “In November 2020, in part due to the REA's Bioenergy Strategy, Government committed to producing a new Biomass Strategy for the UK.” **\[S9\]** 

 Our research impacts extend overseas through the funding and development of technologies that help deliver sustainable development goals in low\- and middle\-income countries, including the Philippines **\[S10\]** and South Africa with Aston is leading the research component of the current DfID project on bioenergy in Sub\-Saharan Africa and high\-level international engagement with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in key countries. \[Text removed for publication\] notes they have used: 

 “UK bioenergy research \(from Thornley, Röder, Chong etc.\) to connect with the wider international research landscape” and as a “basis to develop international collaborations and understanding in this area” noting  a “workshop \(chaired by Thornley\)” in Washington D.C. in 2019 “ supported discussion and alignment of emerging policy frameworks to support low carbon aviation fuels.” Overall the *\[text removed for publication\]* notes our work has “enhanced the Departmental evidence base around state of the art technologies and challenges, supporting us in clearly defining and pursuing work programmes that have accelerated our progress towards deployment of sustainable biofuels in the UK.” **\[S5\]**

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Insect pollinators, especially bees, benefit food security and biodiversity worldwide, with an annual economic value measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet many bee species, including 9% of Europe's bees, are threatened or declining. UEA research has led to impact to prevent or reverse such declines through two approaches. **Bourke**'s research provided a key part of the evidence base for the UK Government's Countryside Stewardship agri\-environment scheme for pollinators in England. **Dicks**'s research contributed to a set of global policy recommendations on pollinators for governments, which were then incorporated into a formal decision of the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity, in turn stimulating the European Union's Pollinators Initiative and national pollinator strategies in up to 30 countries across the world. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 
Animal pollination, to which bees are major contributors, is worth USD235\-577,000,000,000 \(12\-2016\) to annual global crop production and its loss would reduce production by 5\-8%. Pollinating bees comprise wild bees and managed populations of honeybees. Both contribute essential natural pollination services, and both are experiencing declines from a broad set of causes. These declines are most severe in wild bees, with 9% of European species assessed as Threatened. Hence research on how best to prevent or reverse wild bee declines is widely recognised as urgently needed. **Bourke** and **Dicks** have conducted empirical, field\-based studies and large\-scale data syntheses that have provided the evidence for government interventions and stimulated global policy development to aid wild bees and other pollinators. 

 <ins> *Providing evidence for</ins> <ins>UK</ins> <ins>G</ins><ins>overnment</ins> <ins></ins><ins>interventions</ins> <ins></ins><ins>to aid</ins> <ins>pollinators*</ins>: A frequently\-used government intervention to aid pollinators within agricultural landscapes is to pay land managers to plant strips of flowers along arable field margins to provide floral resources for pollinators. However, little evidence existed to demonstrate the effectiveness of such agri\-environment schemes or to guide the scale over which they should be implemented. **Bourke** was Joint PI on a major collaborative project under the UK's Insect Pollinators Initiative \[Grant A\] designed to address these questions. This large\-scale project investigated the spatial ecology of bumblebees \( *Bombus* species; see image\), which form the main group of wild bee pollinators in temperate countries. The team used a novel combination of field ecology, remote sensing, DNA analysis and landscape modelling to determine the relationship between bees' use of space and the siting of floral resources in five representative bumblebee species \[R1\-R3\]. The study area was in arable farmland experimentally planted with floral margins for pollinators based on the UK Government's existing agri\-environment scheme for England \[R1\]. 

 By measuring workers' colony\-specific foraging distances \(average distance flown by workers from a given nest to flower patches\), the research showed that workers forage more closely to their nests in areas with greater coverage of semi\-natural vegetation, including planted floral margins \[R2, R3\]. This suggested that planting these margins helps bee populations by reducing the energy workers spend on foraging longer distances \[R2\]. In the first analysis of its kind, the research also showed that bumblebee nests within 250\-1,000m of high\-quality floral resources are significantly more likely to have daughter queens surviving to the following spring \[R3\]. Overall, the findings both confirmed the value of agri\-environment schemes for pollinators and indicated the spatial and temporal scale of the floral resources required for such interventions to be effective \[R1\-R3\]. In particular, the team's research allowed it to estimate the proportion of agricultural landscape \(1\-3%\) that would need to contain flower\-rich habitat for the foraging distances of bumblebee workers to be maintained at or below their species averages \[R2\]. 

 <ins> *Stimulating</ins> <ins>g</ins><ins>lobal p</ins><ins>olicy</ins> <ins>development</ins> <ins>to aid</ins> <ins>pollinators*</ins>: **Dicks** was a Co\-ordinating Lead Author of the UN's Inter\-governmental Science\-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services \(IPBES\) thematic assessment on pollinators, pollination and food production \[S4\]. By synthesising results and data from hundreds of scientific studies, this international collaboration produced the largest ever global assessment of pollinators. **Dicks** led the team producing the chapter on policy responses \[S4\], key findings of which were published in \[R4\]. Based on the information thereby acquired on the benefits provided by pollinators, the scale of their global declines and the threats they face, **Dicks** then led the development of 10 specific global policy recommendations for pollinators. These were developed through consultation with the scientific advice body \(Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice, SBSTTA\) to the Convention on Biological Diversity, which is the UN's international treaty on biodiversity arising from the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. The 10 policy recommendations were published by **Dicks** and co\-authors in \[R5\] and were to: *""1. Raise pesticide regulatory standards. 2. Promote integrated pest management \(IPM\). 3. Include indirect and sublethal effects in GM crop risk assessments. 4. Regulate movement of managed pollinators. 5. Develop incentives, such as insurance schemes, to help farmers benefit from ecosystem services instead of agrochemicals. 6. Recognize pollination as an agricultural input in extension services. 7. Support diversified farming systems. 8. Conserve and restore 'green infrastructure' \(a network of habitats that pollinators can move between\) in agricultural and urban landscapes. 9. Develop long\-term monitoring of pollinators and pollination. 10. Fund participatory research on improving yields in organic, diversified, and ecologically intensified farming""* \[R5\]. 

 **Dicks** and collaborators also published a research report for the Convention on Biological Diversity that synthesised evidence for the value of pollinators beyond their agricultural value \(e.g. ecological, cultural, financial, health, human and social value\) \[R6\]. **Dicks** contributed an entire section \(Section 5.4, amounting to c. 10%\) of this extensive report. **Dicks** conducted her work on global policy development for pollinators both before and after joining UEA in 2016 \[Grant B\], having previously been at the University of Cambridge from 2008, with the underpinning outputs \[R4\-R6\] having been published when at UEA.

 4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> *Providing evidence for</ins> <ins>UK</ins> <ins>G</ins><ins>overnment interventions</ins> <ins>to aid</ins> <ins>pollinators*</ins>: **Bourke**'s research has had impact through informing public policy with research evidence. This had led to changes in government regulations to enhance pollination services and biodiversity, so aiding pollinators and thereby benefiting agricultural practitioners and the environment. 

 In 2015 the UK Government launched a new version of Countryside Stewardship, its agri\-environment scheme for England, to run to 2020 \[S1\]. Countryside Stewardship provides financial incentives to farmers, foresters and land managers to care for and improve the environment, including wildlife habitats. Via regular dialogue between the team and contacts in Natural England/Defra, the research of **Bourke** and collaborators \[R1\-R3\] provided a key component of the evidence base for Countryside Stewardship's pollinator\-focused actions. In particular, the team's finding \[R2\] that a coverage of 1\-3% of agricultural landscape by flower\-rich habitat would allow bumblebee workers to forage at or below their species\-average foraging distance directly informed the Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package within Countryside Stewardship. This Package is the set of farmland management options, including the planting of floral margins alongside arable fields, designed to benefit wild pollinators and other farm wildlife. Specifically, the finding defined the minimum area threshold for option coverage within the Package, i.e., at least 3% total area to be planted with floral margins, this threshold being mandatory for the scheme's Mid\-Tier version or higher \[S1\]. It also informed the package's advice to select a combination of options and to distribute them spatially within farms \[S1\]. Evidencing this, the Countryside Stewardship Manual stated, *""Recent evidence suggests that applying the right combination of options over 3 to 5% of the arable, temporary grass or permanent grass included in an application will deliver meaningful benefits to farm wildlife""* \[S1\]. In addition, as Natural England's Nature Recovery Team stated, *""The research findings of the IPI bumble bee project team helped to set the 3% minimum threshold for option coverage in the CS Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package""* \[S2\]. Moreover, the package has *""helped in an overall increase in the delivery of land management options such as flower\-rich grass margins and pollen and nectar mixes, which are crucially important in helping to provide the year\-round life cycle needs of pollinating insects""* \[S2\]. Although it is too early to determine if any interventions since 2015 have increased UK bee numbers, a 2019 study concluded that, against general trends for pollinators, crop\-pollinating bees increased by 12% in Britain between 1980 and 2013 and that this could be due to previous agri\-environment schemes, which were similar in kind if not in scale to those implemented by Countryside Stewardship \[S3\]. 

 <ins> *Stimulating</ins> <ins>global policy development</ins> <ins>to aid</ins> <ins>pollinators*</ins>: **Dicks**'s research has had a suite of primary and downstream impacts stimulating and influencing the policy and practice of governments and international agencies as regards safeguarding pollinators and pollination services, so benefiting agricultural practitioners and the environment on a global scale. 

 The primary impact has been that the UN's multilateral treaty body for biodiversity, the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed two formal decisions that draw heavily on the work of the global IPBES pollinator assessment \[S4\] and outputs \[R4\-R6\] co\-authored by **Dicks** \[S5\]. This followed an approach to **Dicks** and co\-authors by the secretariat of the Convention \[S5\]. As a UN treaty, this Convention has 196 party countries and 168 signatories. Its Decision XIII/15 \[S6\], taken at the Convention conference in Mexico in late 2016 \(COP13\), formally endorsed the key messages of the assessment \[S4\] that were included and further developed in \[R4\] and \[R5\]. It also listed specific actions for Governments to follow, and these included all 10 policy recommendations in \[R5\]. In short, each policy recommendation in \[R5\] by **Dicks** and collaborators has been incorporated into a formal decision of a UN treaty body \[S6\]. As the Deputy Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity stated, *""… I approached a number of the authors* \[of the IPBES assessment\] *, including Dr. Dicks, for scientific inputs in drafting policy recommendations for Governments with a view to including these in a draft SBSTTA* \[Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice to the Convention\] *recommendation. … At the same time, Dr. Dicks led the development of a scientific paper published as* \[Dicks et al. 2016 *Science*, R5\] *. The thinking behind the paper informed the development of the SBSTTA policy recommendations, and indeed, the policy recommendations in the* Science *paper and the SBSTTA recommendations are very closely aligned. The paper* \[R5\] *also helped … give added scientific weight to the Convention's draft recommendations, helping their formal adoption by Governments at the thirteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties* \[COP13\] *. With only minor changes, the policy recommendations were subsequently adopted by the COP as decision XIII/15 in December 2016""* \[S5\]. 

 Following up, in a further decision on pollinators, Decision 14/6 \[S7\] taken at the Convention on Biological Diversity's conference in Egypt in 2018 \(COP14\), the Convention mandated the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation to implement a joint Plan of Action for the conservation and sustainable use of pollinators. This plan \[S7\] again included the actions recommended by \[R5\], and cited \[R6\] as major support, i.e. **Dicks**'s collaborative research synthesising the contributions of pollinators beyond their agricultural value such as value for society and quality of life. 

 Prompted by the Convention on Biological Diversity's formal Decision XIII/15, two major, global\-scale downstream impacts have also occurred. One is that a collaboration of Governments across the world created ""Promote Pollinators, a Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators"". With a founding membership \(including the UK\) of 14 countries in 2016, by 2020 this coalition included 30 countries, each committed to developing its own national pollinator strategy \[S8\]. Evidencing this, its website states: *""Promote Pollinators was established in December 2016 as the result of deliberations during* \[COP13, = Decision XIII/15 conference\] *. During this conference, …, fourteen countries decided to unite and collaborate in an international coalition, in order to bring about progress in the protection of pollinating species and their habitats""* \[S8\]. The other downstream impact is that, in 2018, citing Decision XIII/15, the European Commission launched its own European Union Pollinators Initiative \[S9\]. This is an EU\-wide strategy to address pollinator declines across Europe, which from January 2019 has been implemented in collaboration with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the Institute for European Environmental Policy \[S10\]. 

 Overall, both the primary and downstream impacts of the work of **Dicks** and collaborators have had a positive and ongoing effect on UN and Government actions for pollinators. As the Deputy Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity has stated, Decision XIII/15, \[S4\] and \[R5\] *""have fostered increased efforts by Governments and stakeholders on this crucial issue for biodiversity, and the issue of pollinators and pollination is likely to feature explicitly in the post\-2020 global biodiversity framework currently in development under the Convention""* \[S5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Spencer led to the creation of an influential new holistic model of migrant integration which provides a framework to support policy making and practice. The Global Exchange on Migration and Diversity \(GEM\) built this model into two programmes of sustained knowledge exchange which have engaged senior officers and politicians in 28 UK and European cities. Research by Broadhead explores and shapes, in an iterative way, the understanding and design of migrant inclusion and integration policy initiatives developed by local governments. As a result, a wide range of concrete initiatives to improve integration at the local level have been developed, including: improvement of provisions for homeless migrants, new initiatives to support language provision, the provision of immigration advice, and programmes to support employment for refugees and asylum seekers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Spencer’s research \(jointly developed with sociologist Prof. Katharine Charsley, University of Bristol\) led to an influential model of migrant integration processes \( **R1**\), using the first sustained empirical evidence on the relationships between marriage migration and processes of integration \(the Marriage Migration and Integration study, **R2**\). The distinctively holistic model examines processes of integration across multiple interacting domains, including employment, education, social networks, extended family living, gender relations and belonging. This model sets out that integration processes: 

1.  Are concerned with both newcomers and receiving communities, in mutual, two\-way processes with a third, transnational dimension; 

1.  Take place across society \(not only through public policy interventions\) and require a range of actors to be involved and to take shared responsibility to ensure successful outcomes; 

1.  Can go forwards or backwards over time and in which an experience in one domain may impact on the experiences in another; 

1.  Can be impacted positively or negatively by a wide range of factors including policy interventions, employment and welfare restrictions attached to immigration status, human capital, family and social networks and opportunity structures 

1.  Takes place, mostly, at the local level. 

 The ESRC\-funded Marriage Migration and Integration study that further informed this model \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\) employed a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate integration processes across the different domains of integration. Data supplied by the Office for National Statistics’ Labour Force Survey \(2004\-2014\) was a key source in the structural domain \(employment, education\) and on household composition. 78 semi\-structured interviews with sibling pairs of British Pakistani Muslims and Indian Sikhs, in which one of the siblings married transnationally, and 5 focus groups with 25 participants, provided data on the social, cultural, civic and identity domains. Interviews were conducted in both the North \(Bradford, Leeds\) and South \(Birmingham, Bristol, London\) of England. The conceptual development of the model took forward a definition and analysis of integration Spencer had previously developed independently in research on the pressures and constraints around migration as a rapidly shifting policy area\( **R7**\). 

 The work of the Global Exchange of Migration \(GEM, led by Broadhead since 2019\), has ensured that the benefits of this model reaches policymakers, whilst also iteratively strengthening this model with new research. GEM developed an innovative ‘city working group model’ which engages local government over the long term – both as a method of achieving research impact, but also in informing and co\-designing research outputs and lines of enquiry. A key example of this is exploring the range ways in which Spencer and Charsley’s integration model \( **R1**\) has been adapted by local authorities. Research findings about adoption of the integration model have fed into iterations of work carried out by the GEM team with the city working groups \( **R4**, **R5**, **R6**\). 

 In this later research \( **R4**, **R5**, **R6**\), Broadhead outlines the role of knowledge exchange as a research methodology, and the emerging leadership role played by UK cities on integration. **R4** found an emerging leadership role for UK city local government on integration, notwithstanding its low salience as a policy issue. Local government is developing new tools as part of a wider place shaping role – including exploring how strategic communications can shape city wide narratives of inclusion and its role as a convenor and ‘place shaper.’ The research explored the framing of integration as a policy issue at the local level, including the potential for a ‘newcomer’ frame to illuminate new ways of understanding the issue and develop policy responses. **R5** examines the extent to which the narrative framing of integration policy impacts on service delivery, including through a detailed examination of policy making practice in London. **R6** 

 investigates how local government conceptualises and operationalises its role in integration policy and processes including in the reception of asylum seekers and refugees.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Global Exchange on Migration and Diversity \(GEM\) takes a 360\-degree approach to knowledge exchange which sees GEM research feed into an iterative process of working with city\-level policymakers, and reciprocal feedback into research. This approach has been applied in 28 cities, and as a consequence has led to **improvements in the understanding of migrant integration as a policy area**, which in turn, has resulted in **benefits for policymakers** and **vulnerable migrant groups**, both **in the UK and other parts of Europe**. 

 The research feeds into this knowledge exchange process in three key ways. The first is that the design of the ‘city working group’ model is a practice\-based application of the core elements of the holistic migrant integration model developed by Spencer and Charsley \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\). The second is that the GEM team \(including Spencer and Broadhead\) facilitated the organisation of city working groups and contribute to them directly: they brought together the local authorities, and worked closely with them over a sustained period on developing policy and practice on a range of issues that affect the integration of migrants. In bringing these policymakers together, the city representatives could pool their individual experiences \(sharing best practice internationally\), and the groups provide a mechanism for research \( **R4**\- **R6**\) to reach these policymakers more deeply, to develop their understanding around particular challenges and solutions, and to support the salience of integration as a policy issue at the local level. As well as improving conceptual understanding, by extension, the process also supports the development of new policy and tangible changes at the local level. Third, the adoption of the model \( **R1**\) is the subject of research \(for example on the leadership role of local government in migrant inclusion, **R4**, **R5**, **R6**\) which then feeds back into the city working group, ensuring that city policymakers benefit from an evaluative element that can provide the basis for future discussion and action. Key changes in local policy approaches and practice are most apparent as a result of two GEM\-led programmes that used the city working group model: Action Towards Inclusion \(2014\-2016\) and Inclusive Cities \(2017\-present\). 

 <ins> **Improving migrant inclusion policy and practice in European cities**</ins> 

 The Action Towards Inclusion programme \(2014\-2016\) worked intensively with **16 European cities** \(in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Malta, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK\) to secure reforms in city practices across Europe that address the exclusion of marginal communities from services and civic life. Informed by earlier research by Spencer \(i.e. **R7**\), it took place at the same time Spencer and Charsley’s ESRC project \(2013\-15\), and was informed by an early version of the model later published as **R1**. The city working group model in this case comprised of one representative from each city with responsibility for a key area of policy or practice. The cities were then convened in three thematic working groups: Cohesion and Belonging; Parental Engagement in Schools; and Homelessness and Destitution Amongst Excluded Migrants. The model helped these city representatives facilitate a mutually positive sense of local belonging, via action\-oriented learning exchange within their groups. Each of the cities participating in these working groups produced individual City Action Plans on the relevant theme, authored by local policymakers and published by GEM as the secretariat \(e.g. **E1**, **E2**, **E3**\). 

-  As members of the Cohesion and Belonging group, Brighton and Hove drew on an early iteration of Spencer’s model \( **R1**\) to undertake a Needs Assessment of the city’s migrants, **the first consultation exercise of its kind with this community in Brighton**, gathering both statistical data and feedback from the city’s migrant community. Brighton has over 280,000 residents, and around 18% of city residents \(50,000 people\) were born outside the UK \(ONS 2016\). 22 community researchers were recruited to gather information on communities, with whom the local authority had previously had little contact, for example Chinese and Albanian communities. This methodology has been used as an example of best practice by Public Health England \( **E1**\). Reflecting upon the Needs Assessment process, Brighton and Hove’s representative stated that, *‘*\[Action Towards Inclusion\] *gave me a wider perspective on the integration process and the ability to site my work in a more theoretical framework including comparisons with other cities – which I have been able to incorporate in my communications, reports and recommendations to colleagues.’* \( **E1**\) Community Safety Manager – Refugees and Migrants, Brighton and Hove City Council. 

-  The Parental Engagement in Schools group brought together GEM researchers with senior officials in six different European cities to consider their responses around migrant parent engagement in schools, particularly for groups at risk of exclusion. The project shared research evidence on the topic and asked officials to share their own experiences of planning reforms in their cities. As detailed in their City Action Plan \( **E2**, authored by the representative from the Agency for School Counselling, Landesinstitut Hamburg\), **Hamburg developed a training and mentoring programme** designed to **boost the involvement of migrant parents in their children’s schooling**, including training programmes for teachers and parents to improve intercultural awareness between these groups in response to the increase in refugees resident in the city \( **E2**\). 90% of teachers who took part in the scheme reported feeling better qualified in communicating with parents from migrant backgrounds, and 92% of parents who participated reported feeling move involved and better able to help their children participate in school \( **E2**\). 

-  The Homeless and Destitution group had 5 cities, including Vienna. By directly applying the early model of integration \( **R1**\), as well as synthesized academic literature on migrant destitution and exclusion they were able to design and implement new strategies that improved their assistance to migrants unable to access mainstream housing, for example using video translation software. Vienna produced an Action Plan \( **E3**\) authored by the Head of the Homelessness Assistance Unit from the Vienna Social Fund \(representing the City of Vienna\). The 2017 update to this report showed that the city had begun replacing night shelters with a new model of accommodation known as ‘Chancenhäuser’; **allowing homeless people unconditional access, immediate advice and support**, including special counselling offered to those without access to standard state housing support. \( **E3**\) 

 <ins> **Developing city\-wide approaches to migrant inclusion in the UK**</ins> 

 **Inclusive Cities** \(2017\-present\) works with 12 UK cities to develop a step change in their approach to the inclusion of newcomers at the local level. This knowledge exchange programme supports local authority leaders and their partners to develop \(with support from researchers\) their policy and practice around integration– an area of policy which often has low salience and where resources and capacity are severely restricted \( **R4**\). The primary focus is in **influencing the understanding of and planning concerning integration** **as a policy area** – drawing in insights from Spencer and Broadhead’s research \( **R1**\- **R6**\) and building on these with the input from policy makers and elected officials to create long term and sustained change. 

 The 12 participant cities are Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Liverpool, Peterborough, London \(the original six founder cities\) as well as Belfast, Birmingham, Brighton, Newport, Sheffield, and Newry, Mourne and Down \(as a region\) who joined in the second cohort. Each city committed to developing a city\-wide action plan, fundamentally shaped by the underpinning research \( **R1**\) and detailing their work on inclusion \(formal commitment by the cities can be seen in signed agreement letters, **E4**\). The researchers used findings and feedback from the process of working with these cities to develop the Inclusive Cities Framework \( **E5**\) designed by Broadhead which is now being formally used by all 12 cities to inform and shape their city wide approach to migrant inclusion. 

 Participants of Inclusive Cities completed an anonymous survey in Jan 2019 \( **E6**\). It highlighted the ways in which the programme had enabled them to **improve their understanding** to create change locally. One city participant stated: *‘the methodology and process of IC has been very useful....  \[our city\] has lots of experience in delivering cross\-sectoral action plans, however this has had a significant impact very quickly as it has been incorporated into a City wide strategy with strong political leadership in less than 2 years of it being established’* \( **E6**\). Another city reported ‘ *the background papers have been excellent, I often use them as quick\-reference guides when drafting documents or preparing for local meetings*’ \( **E6**\). A third city reports the programme has **improved the efficacy** of conversations in local government and led to **provisions for vulnerable migrants** that they directly accredit to participation in the programme: ‘ *Conversations are much more joined up on a number of migration\-issues thanks to Inclusive Cities. In terms of outcomes, we now have a support group for foster carers of UASCs* \[unaccompanied asylum\-seeking children\] *, a pathways model for ESOL* \[English to Speakers of Other Languages\] *and employment, and we are piloting a project to offer wraparound support for refugees to engage with Council\-run Job Fairs’* \( **E6**\). A fourth city, describing similarly developed ESOL and employment provision, said that the programme helped them to secure funds: ‘ *We have attracted £160K* \[GBP160,000\] *towards new programmes…and a review of mental health support for refugees*’ \( **E6**\). To date, 6 of these action plans have been signed off by the local authorities and published. A selection of tangible changes in city practice and policy following participation in Inclusive Cities include: 

-  Liverpool’s participation in Inclusive Cities has helped them to create their **first strategic plan for integration in the city**: the ‘Our Liverpool’ Refugee, People Seeking Asylum and Vulnerable Migrant Strategy. The Strategy sets out the vision of Liverpool as ‘ *a welcoming city where refugees, people seeking asylum and vulnerable migrants are able to rebuild their lives from the day they arrive*’ \( **E7**\). Liverpool has a population of almost 500,000 inhabitants. As a port city, it has a long history of both inward and outward migration – as of 2018, 11.5% of the population in Liverpool is foreign born and the city is home to over 1,500 asylum seekers, one of the highest relative levels in the UK. The strategy sets out targeted objectives in a wide range of migration inclusion policy areas as identified in Spencer and Broadhead’s research. The actions identified in the strategy are credited to participation in the Programme:  ‘ *Liverpool then went on to participate in the Inclusive Cities project, a UK wide learning exchange programme facilitated by Oxford University. The action plans from this, with its focus on English language learning and communicating an inclusive narrative, dovetail with the actions plans for this Strategy’ \(* **E7** *\)*. The work on the city’s messaging had already begun, with the strategy also crediting the overarching ‘Our Liverpool’ welcome message for the city, as being ‘ *developed through the Inclusive Programme*’ \( **E7, E8**\). 

-  Bristol’s Inclusive Cities Action Plan reflects benefits to how the thinking on inclusion and integration undertaken in the course of producing the Plan was already leading to change in the city. By 2019, Bristol Council had **established a new legal advice project** targeted at enabling young people in care with uncertain immigration status and subject to immigration control to access support by establishing ‘ *a process to identify undocumented young people and ensure they access appropriate legal advice*’\( **E9**\). The Action Plan notes that the project has **secured funding** from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation through a partnership with Bristol Refugee Rights. Launched later in 2019, the project supported 44 young people in its first year \(‘Young People’s Immigration Project’, **E10a**\). Following the publication of the Action Plan, the role of Inclusive Cities was fixed in Bristol’s Refugee and Asylum Seeker Strategy \( **E10b**\), in the ‘Influencing the System’ strand: ‘ *Lead the Inclusive Cities project in Bristol, convening key stakeholders in the city to make progress on the inclusion of newcomers*’ \( **E10**\). The implementation of the Inclusive Cities Action Plan for Bristol is now a **formalised measure of success** for the council. 

-  Cardiff has used the Inclusive Cities process, via an Action Plan, to begin to implement its ambition to become a multilingual smart city in which migrants are equipped with the language skills necessary to thrive in their day\-to\-day lives. It has **secured funding** from Welsh Government to establish REACH – a co\-ordinated gateway for the provision of English for Speakers of Other Languages that ensures an effective assessment of need, and allocation of appropriate and timely provision of services run by Cardiff and Vale College \(documented in Action Plan, **E11** and as a case study in the Inclusive Cities Framework **E5**\)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers in C\-DaRE have worked with IT developers, custodians of cultural content, dance artists, and marginalised dance communities to create digital applications for dance practices as aspects of intangible cultural heritage \(ICH\). The research, driven by enabling impact, has been into datafication and transmission of ICH, and the relationship between dance content and machine learning. The research has led to three areas of impact: \(1\) changes in methods used by IT developers working with dance content; \(2\) new approaches to curation of dance content and safeguarding practices that feed into wider sector practices; \(3\) increased visibility for marginalised dance communities.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research of Professor Sarah Whatley, Dr Rosamaria Cisneros and Dr Karen Wood at Coventry University focuses upon how dance, as an embodied practice, calls on new methods for digital tool development in order to archive, annotate, share, reuse and safeguard dance content online. 

 Through Europeana Space, an EU funded project \(2014\-2017, G1;  [https://www.europeana\-space.eu/](https://www.europeana-space.eu/)\), Whatley and Cisneros investigated ways in which ICH might generate commercial revenue. As part of the project, Whatley and Cisneros worked with IT experts and entrepreneurs to develop the apps, Dancespaces and Dancepro. Dancespaces targeted the needs of dance enthusiasts and pre\-dance professionals who want to share and explore content about a particular aspect of dance. **DancePro** provided a tool for researchers and dance experts \(e.g. dance artists, choreographers\) to access dance content and create metadata \(R2, R4\). 

 Through an EU funded project, WhoLoDancE \(2015\-2018, G2,  [http://www.wholodance.eu/](http://www.wholodance.eu/)\) Whatley, Wood and Cisneros worked closely with technologists to develop apps that capture dance as ICH \(in particular, Flamenco and Greek folk dance\) and influence ways in which dance is taught, learnt and made. Changes in consumption and use became apparent in audiences and educators through an extended evaluation process, involving 200\+ respondents across the dance sector, Europe\-wide. Tool development \(including for annotation, similarity search, blending engine, hololens experience\) revealed how the plasticity of dance needs to be built into software practices \(R3, R4\). 

 The role of Flamenco as a vehicle for intercultural communication was the focus of the work by Cisneros in her contribution to the EU\-funded RICHES project:  [https://www.riches\-project.eu/index.html](https://www.riches-project.eu/index.html) \(R1\). Cisneros organised the Coventry FlamenKo Festival \(3\-7 November 2014, G4,  [https://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/the\-roma\-in\-coventry\-digital\-practices\-and\-identity\-expression/](https://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/the-roma-in-coventry-digital-practices-and-identity-expression/)\), designed to educate the public about Flamenco, and to showcase Gypsy/Roma cultural art forms. The Festival offered insights into how engagement with Romani cultural heritage can be sustained; how digital technologies can be used effectively to document and promote these initiatives for larger audiences; and how art can be used as an entry point and vehicle for intercultural communication. 515 people attended the festival including students, academics, artists, citizens and politicians \(R5\). The research demonstrated that the festival changed audience perceptions of marginalised and minority communities, increased visibility of this community’s dance practices, and provided venues with new ways to access history \(R5\). 

 The EU funded project CultureMoves led by Cisneros and Whatley \(2018\-2020, G3\) explored the impact that dance and dance content accessible through Europeana, and available via digital technologies, could have on tourism and touristic experiences. They hosted a series of 12 lab\-days over 18 months involving 275 stakeholders including dancers, choreographers, artists, academics, CH institutions and architecture MA students from countries including UK, Italy and Portugal. Research showed that dance provides access to ‘hidden’ aspects of a site, monument, or landscape, and that digital tools can stimulate new stories for making the bridge between dance and tourism \(R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2014, researchers in C\-DaRE have worked with IT developers, custodians of cultural content, dance artists, and marginalised and minority dance communities on research projects driven by enabling impact. They have created a range of digital applications for dance practices as aspects of ICH **\(S7\).** 

 **1.    IT developers have changed ways of developing tools and interfaces and methods for exploiting and consuming digital dance content while recognising dancers’ different practices, needs and expectations.** The Innovation Manager of IN2 **\(S1\)** on the ESpace and CultureMoves projects **\(R6, G1, G3\)**, said that his company now “ *better understand\(s\) the unique qualities of dance as an artistic medium, and of the specialist needs of the dance community who would be the eventual end users of the ICT system.”* Collaboration enabled *“a truly user\-driven development process, a key aspect for delivering user\-friendly software tools”.* In interface development, the technologies have *“transferred to the commercial products that we bring to the market. Our commercial solutions, like the MyMeedia platform for \(...\) multimedia content, are a direct result of the learning and development that occurred in the creation of the applications for these projects in terms of technology innovation and gained know\-how in how to design better systems...”* The Founder and CEO of PeachNote **\(S5\)** on WhoLoDance **\(R3, R4, G2\)**, describes how the collaboration with the C\-DaRE team influenced their product development, changing methods for how they *“measure and analyse human motion and expression”.* 

 **2.Custodians of cultural content have changed safeguarding and curatorial practices, with impact on the dance sector **.** An ICT expert and cultural heritage SME owner **\(S2\),** a collaborator on RICHES and ESpace **\(R1, R2\),** states that C\-DaRE’s work has led to rethinking the involvement of ‘community’ and ‘user’ in developing digital technologies within cultural heritage organisations, with wider application for other cultural practices and how learning can *“transform the whole sector”*. The ICT expert noted: *“the unique accommodations that dance requires in terms of digitisation is imposing a change on how we consider best practices within the ICH sector. It has made obvious how deficient some of the technologies we rely on are and impos\(ed\) innovation in how we conduct our work.”* 

 Changed practices have helped creative influencers to shape sector trends. The co\-founder of the REMIX Summits **\(S3\)** collaborated on the ESpace project **\(R2\)**. He said that “ *Working with dance experts from the C\-DaRE team has made me consider more deeply the body in space, the organisation of the body and the specific concerns of integrating technology with dance and the moving body in other projects.”*  This collaboration also had an impact on ACMI X with the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, StartSpace with the State Library of Victoria and Foundry 658, and has *“fed into the programming of the REMIX Summits.”* Whatley and Cisneros’s research enabled the entrepreneur to expand his own work into dance which included a collaboration with Studio Wayne McGregor on QuestLab. This allowed the entrepreneur to *“apply to the creation of ideas about dance and technology, the incubation of these ideas through research and development phases, and business modelling process”.* 

 **3. Awareness has been heightened that combining technologies and dance can raise the visibility of marginalised and minority dance communities.** Cisneros’s staging of the FlamenKo Festival **\(R5\)** in RICHES **\(G4\)** and development of the RomArchive emerged from the confluence of research in dance and technology. The RomArchive has won several awards, the most prestigious being the European Heritage Awards Grand Prix organised by the European Commission and Europa Nostra **\(S6\).** The participatory project directly involved the Roma community and has had impact on Roma, Gypsy and Traveller groups by illuminating their own history.The ED of Romani Cultural & Arts Company \(RCAC\)\) **\(S4\)** said the *“research and resultant festival made clear how the arts, culture and technology can promote the contributions of marginalised groups, be used to disrupt commonly held stereotypes of the Roma people and can aid intercultural communication”*: the research *“would position and represent the Roma people”*. The project also changed perceptions of other communities by making *“clear the diversity in these communities and challeng\(ing\) stereotypes”.* The RCAC can now evidence the *“capabilities and status of the organisation when applying for future funding programmes, or in advocating for the Roma, Gypsy and Traveller communities to local and national governments”.* The work has expanded, gaining funding from the German Cultural Foundation and receiving attention from the Minister of State for Europe, Michael Roth, at the event ‘Reinventing Roma Inclusion’ at the opening of ERIAC 2019 **\(S6\).**

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 The international Square Kilometre Array \(SKA\) radio telescope, due for construction this decade, will be the world’s largest scientific facility, built at a cost of \~EUR2,000,000,000 by a consortium of 15 member countries. The larger part of the instrument will be sited in Africa \(nine partner countries\) with a complementary part in Australia. The University of Manchester’s \(UoM\) Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics \(JBCA\) has been central to the establishment of this multinational radio astronomy infrastructure. The impact in the 2013\-2020 period is on: i\) international science policy and priorities, with the establishment of the SKA Organisation \(SKAO\) as an Inter\-Governmental Organisation \(IGO\) at Jodrell Bank Observatory \(GBP16,500,000\); ii\) UK business return \(EUR121,900,000\); and iii\) the local North\-West economy \(\~GBP6,200,000\).

##  2. Underpinning research 

 The next transformational step in radio astronomy, which will shape its future for many decades, is the Square Kilometre Array \(SKA\), an international project to develop the world’s largest radio telescope combining hundreds of dishes and millions of low frequency antennae in South Africa and Australia. When synchronised to within a picosecond, this array will have a collecting area in excess of one square kilometre, with the promise of dramatic advances in multiple fields and the opportunity to address fundamental challenges in physics. Researchers from UoM have made critical contributions to the SKA programme since its inception, including the scientific justification for construction, technical design elements, and supporting technologies that enable the SKA to function. 

 **Defining the scientific requirements for the SKA:** The originating idea for the SKA arose in Manchester in 1991. In 2004, the international astronomy community came together to describe the SKA’s scientific potential and to establish the generic characteristics of a telescope with the required transformational capabilities. In 2005, this science case catalysed EC and pan\-European national funding for a coordinated EUR32,000,000 programme of technological research, which gave initial substance to the ambitions. This research in turn formed a major component of the international preliminary design specification in 2011. In 2014, the science case for the SKA was revisited and a full science case was published. From the 2014 science case the SKA Organisation identified 13 “key science priorities” that should drive the design of the telescope. These formed the key reference for the SKA Level 0 Science Requirements, which in turn inform the Level 1 Technical Requirements for the instruments. 

 UoM researchers have made major contributions towards the scientific justifications for building the SKA, both through advancing the field of radio astronomy and determining how hypotheses could be tested by observing astrophysical phenomena. In particular, UoM researchers outlined the scientific justification for using the SKA to conduct a pan\-galactic survey of pulsars, which will allow several physics hypotheses to be tested **\[1\]** including the possible detection of extremely low\-frequency gravitational waves, the “No Hair” theorem for black holes, and the nuclear composition of neutron stars. They showed that tests of General Relativity, which can only be tested in extremely high\-gravity environments such as pulsars orbiting black holes, could also be conducted with a sufficiently powerful telescope such as the SKA **\[1\]**. Pulsar searching and high\-precision timing form two of the 13 key science priorities for the SKA. 

 **Detailing the technical requirements of the SKA:** In 2010, the Square Kilometre Array Design Study \(SKADS\) working group, which was chaired by and included several UoM researchers, produced a technical report that detailed the pathway by which a fully functional SKA could be built **\[2\]**, based partly on the ambition laid out in UoM’s early proposals. The SKADS group found that an SKA design that provided the desired level of capability could be built with a budget of EUR1,500,000,000 **\[2\]**. It laid out a dynamic timetable for construction and identified the improvements in processing and communications technology that would be needed to meet the construction timeline. Specific designs for the telescope component of the SKA were developed in the PrepSKA Work Package 2, a working group led by UoM’s Richard Schilizzi **\[3\]**. This work was the basis for the initial project specification, agreed upon in 2011, and produced the conceptual designs for all major telescope sub\-systems of the SKA. 

 **Advancing technology to enable the SKA’s successful operation:** UoM researchers have also conducted key research into new technologies that will enable the SKA to function. For example, data received by each of the thousands of detectors must be synchronised to within 1 picosecond for the SKA to operate successfully. Paper **\[4\]**, through crucial experiments conducted at UoM’s Jodrell Bank, found that a fibre\-based layer\-by\-layer system could achieve the necessary frequency transfer stabilities of 1 picosecond in 1 second. Stabilities of this level are sufficient to provide the temporal coherence required between the SKA’s antennas. This novel technology development, coupled with the expertise in high\-volume astronomical data transport built through the UoM\-led e\-MERLIN project, resulted in UoM being chosen to lead the international SKA Signal and Data Transport \(SaDT\) Consortium in 2013, with UoM researchers constituting 14 of the 45 members of the working group, including the Chair, at peak project time. The consortium developed detailed designs of the data transport and timing networks for the SKA. This design work was very complex due to the networks’ integration into every element of the telescope, reflected by the fact that the final design was captured in 279 separate documents, summarised by UoM researchers in 2018 **\[5\]**. These designs have since passed Critical Design Review \(CDR\) by a panel of 32 independent experts, and has been incorporated into the SKA’s baseline design. 

 UoM researchers have also demonstrated that the low frequency technology used for SKA can be calibrated by establishing the flux scale for low\-frequency radio astronomy, which resulted in the award of the 2019 Jackson\-Gwilt medal of the Royal Astronomical Society to Scaife, with the citation: “ *establishes a new flux scale optimised for facilities such as LOFAR* \[Low Frequency Array\] *and SKA. This work has become the gold standard for flux calibration and now underpins all low\-frequency radio observing*”. They have also advanced the big data technologies that are required for the SKA to function. In a 2019 paper, UoM researchers defined a processing pipeline capable of handling the huge volumes of data that will be generated by the SKA **\[6\]**.

 The body of underpinning research, which was conducted by UoM over many years, was funded by several grants totalling approximately GBP27,200,000. Much of this funding includes SKA design, development and technology funding, including the funds that helped produce the SKADS **\[2\]** and PrepSKA **\[3\]** documents.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 UoM has been at the centre stage of the scientific and the technical development work that has established the SKA viability, beginning with its inception. Over the past decade, the technical feasibility of the project, including timeframe and cost, has been defined in detail through a formal system engineering process, construction funding has been secured, and the coordinating organisation over\-seeing the project has been transformed by international treaty into an inter\-governmental organisation \(the SKAO\) headquartered in the UK and hosted by UoM. Impact from the scientific and technical research programmes is in three areas: international science policy and priorities; economic return to the UK from the SKA project; and local economic impact from the establishment of the first IGO in the North West of England. This impact has been enabled by field\-leading fundamental research from UoM, technical designs produced and led by UoM researchers, and technology development specifically targeted at enabling the SKA’s systems. 

 **4.1 Science policy and priorities \[A, B, C\]:** The initial co\-ordinating body for the SKA, the “SKA Organisation” \(SKAO\), was formed in 2011 and the site decision for the instruments in South Africa and Australia was taken in 2013, making the SKA\-MID telescope the first fully international science infrastructure to be sited in Africa. In 2015, the site decision for the global headquarters of the project was made through a competitive bidding exercise. The bids were assessed on 11 formal criteria, including local research environment. The UK was successful in its bid for the SKA headquarters to be sited at Jodrell Bank Observatory, with the UK case building heavily on UoM’s historic and continued contributions to SKA research, as well as their “ *long and significant history of world\-leading research in radio astronomy*” **\[C\]**. Letters of support from 19 UK companies, government ministers and local MPs further reinforced the case **\[C\]**. The GBP16,500,000 construction budget for the headquarters was supported by BEIS \(GBP9,800,000\), UoM \(GBP5,200,000\) and Cheshire East Council \(GBP1,500,000\). 

 In March 2019, an international treaty was signed by the member countries establishing the SKAO as an inter\-governmental organisation **\[C\]**. IGO status for the SKAO, as proposed in the UoM\-led PrepSKA document **\[3\]**, grants diplomatic immunities and privileges to the SKAO, and reduces project costs by granting exemption from Value Added Tax \(VAT\) and duties on associated spending **\[A\]**.  Additionally, the SKA’s Deputy Director\-General highlights that the treaty\-based nature of IGO status “ *increases the security of project funding, ensures the inviolability of documents and data and ensures SKAO staff may be recruited largely independent of standard immigration processes.*” **\[A\]**. The SKA treaty was ratified by the UK in December 2020 and the IGO entered into force in February 2021 **\[A\]**. 

 **4.2 UK business return from the SKA \[A, D\]:** The baseline design for the technical specifications of the SKA instruments and infrastructure commenced in 2013 and was undertaken by nine international consortia. Two of these consortia were led from the UK: Signal and Data Transport \(SaDT; University of Manchester\) and Science Data Processor \(SDP; University of Cambridge\). The total earned value of these consortia to the project was EUR38,000,000 **\[A\]**. 

 Technical design work was evaluated by a formal system engineering process overseen centrally by the SKAO, culminating in consortium\-level Critical Design Reviews \(CDRs\) which were passed in 2018 \(SaDT\) and 2019 \(SDP\). An overall SKA System CDR then began in December 2019, concluding in March 2020 **\[A\]**. Successful conclusion of the CDR process demonstrated to member states that the project proposal was both feasible and achievable within an acceptable timeframe and cost and the SKAO is currently seeking confirmed financial contributions totalling EUR1,986,000,000 over the period 2021\-2030. A “ *significant fraction*” of these funds has been secured, and work is continuing to secure the remainder **\[A\]**. The UK government’s Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) has confirmed GBP190,000,000 to support the project: this includes GBP100,000,000 in capital expenditure towards construction, and a further GBP90,000,000 towards operations and support for the HQ between 2021 and 2030. 

 To date, a total of EUR121,900,000 in construction contracts for the SKA has been awarded to UK organisations, significantly in excess of the UK’s capital contribution to the project and many as a direct result of UoM’s contribution to the SKA design **\[A\]**. These contracts include the non\-imaging processing component of the SKA Data Processing Tier 1 \(primary\) contract awarded in 2019 **\[A\]**. This component has a value of EUR15,000,000, of the total EUR63,400,000 of the Data Processing Tier 1 contract **\[A\]**, and was awarded based on the expertise in pulsar science at UoM **\[1\]**. In their 2017 Impact Report, STFC states that some 55 UK companies had already been awarded contracts connected to SKA work for a combined GBP5,900,000 **\[D\]**. In 2020, as a result of the design work conducted by the UoM SaDT team **\[4, 5\]** and their track record in this area, the UK was also selected as the Tier 1 lead for the SKA Synchronisation, Timing and Clocks construction contracts, valued at EUR9,900,000 **\[A\]**. 

 **4.3 Local economic impact from the establishment of the SKAO at Jodrell Bank \[A, D, E\]:** Between August 2013 and July 2020 the SKAO has received in excess of EUR80,000,000 in operational funding from the member states, including BEIS, as well as various EU funding streams **\[A\]**. This funding includes support for UK\-based SKAO staff who oversaw the development of the SKA baseline design and production of prototype components, as well as the outsourcing of technology development. 

 The SKAO workforce in August 2013 was 26 full\-time staff **\[A\]**. By July 2020 this number had increased to 105 full\-time staff, including employees from 20 countries, and recruitment is still ongoing **\[A\]**. These staff are “ *a mixture of scientists, system engineers, domain specialists, software engineers and project managers, supported by business\-enabling staff*” **\[A\]**. The SKAO has also benefited directly from UoM’s strong research environment by employing or seconding seven staff directly from the University. The SKA’s Project Director emphasises the benefit of recruiting UoM\-trained experts, saying, “ *Such people are already very familiar with the SKA, having contributed to the design development, and bring technical and other skills that can be immediately deployed to help drive the SKA programme*” **\[A\]**. 

 Since the HQ building became operational in November 2018, its staff have been estimated to contribute around GBP6,200,000 annually to the local economy in Cheshire East and the surrounding area, and are estimated to have invested GBP6,000,000 in the local property market **\[A, D, E\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case\-study is about the decolonisation of historical knowledge in the age of Black Lives Matter. Specifically, it is about how research by Evans on the suppressed history of Wales and Atlantic slavery has been used to extend public understanding and affect the ways in which public bodies handle a difficult, contested past. The impact takes three principal forms: 

1.  supporting change in curatorial practice at the  [National Museum of Wales](https://museum.wales/), a family of seven museums dedicated to different aspects of the Welsh past and culture 

1.  improving the range and quality of information available to communities affected by the legacy of Atlantic slavery 

1.  informing the Welsh Government’s policy on the memorialisation of Atlantic slavery and British imperialism 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The case study draws upon pioneering research by Evans on the relationship between Atlantic slavery and industrial development in Europe, with a particular focus on Welsh industry, first reported upon in 2010 in *Slave Wales: The Welsh and Atlantic Slavery, 1660\-1850* \( **R1**\). This book revealed for the first time the significance of Welsh woollens in the slave Atlantic between the 1680s and the 1840s. These fabrics, known as 'Welsh Plains’, were used in the procurement and maintenance of enslaved workers. Using material in British and US archives, Evans was able to demonstrate how Welsh Plains were \(i\) traded for captives on the Guinea coast, and \(ii\), more importantly, sold in large volumes to planters in the Caribbean and North America. Here, marketed as “Negro Cloth”, Welsh Plains were used to clothe enslaved workers. This was reported in **R1** and **R3**. 

 This was a previously unsuspected finding, but it is of a piece with much recent research on the material functioning of the Atlantic slave complex. It dovetails with other scholarship that points to the profound effects that the provisioning needs of the plantation world \(its demand for food, fuel, packaging, processing equipment, etc.\) had on parts of the world that were, on a superficial view, detached from Atlantic slavery. Evans’ research therefore reinforces the claim that mass enslavement in the New World was in no way aberrant in an age of gathering modernity \(conventionally characterized as a contractual, free\-labour phenomenon\). On the contrary, enslavement *was an expression of emergent modernity*. 

 This is also research that intersects with a generation’s worth of scholarship that sees the manufacturing and trading of textiles as powering global integration in the early modern era. Evans’ work offers a way of linking the history of Welsh rural industry, a story traditionally told in the most insular of ways, into an expansive global narrative. It runs in parallel with the work Evans has conducted on the Welsh copper industry of the eighteenth century, which, by supplying sugar processing and distilling equipment, also had vital links to the plantation world. 

 Evans continues to contribute to this field of scholarship, both through publication \(see **R2**, **R4**, and **R5**\) and through the organisation of conferences, notably *Clothing the Enslaved in the Eighteenth\-Century Atlantic World*, hosted by the National Museum of Wales in 2019 with support from the Pasold Research Fund.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **USW research has supported change in curatorial practice at the National Museum of Wales.** In 2017, in an act of ‘decolonisation’, the National Museum launched a review of its social history collections. To quote the Principal Curator, Contemporary & Community History, ‘we began to critically address the absence of slavery in the interpretation at some of our industrial museum sites. To undertake this review, we were hugely reliant on Professor Evans’s published works and his on\-going research into Welsh plains’ \( **S1**\). 

 The use of Evans’ research was one aspect of an increasingly close relationship between the University of South Wales and the National Museum of Wales. The two signed a memorandum of understanding in 2018, responding to the  [Well\-being of Future Generations Act Wales](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2015/2/introduction/enacted) \(2015\), which requires public bodies in Wales to consciously counteract persistent inequities in wealth, health, and access to cultural resources. 

 Evans’ work on Wales and Atlantic slavery responds to that agenda by **improving** **the range and quality of information available to communities affected by the legacy of Atlantic slavery.** It serves as a bridge between community activism and the articulation of new narratives of the Welsh past within the National Museum of Wales and other cultural institutions. Most notably, Evans’ book *Slave Wales* was the inspiration for a community research project,  [*From Sheep to Sugar: Welsh Wool and Slavery*](http://www.welshplains.cymru/), supported by the National Heritage Lottery Fund in 2019\-2020. The project was based in North and Mid\-Wales, the heartland of Negro Cloth production, and directed by Learning Links International, a social enterprise specialising in educational initiatives linking Wales to the Caribbean and Africa. One of the directors of Learning Links International offers this testimony \( **S2**\): 

 “This idea was based by the challenge made by Professor Chris Evans in his book *Slave Wales*… that ‘The mostly mute landscape must be made to speak’… The Learning Links International team approached Prof. Evans to ask for his support as we took up the challenge and prepared an application for funding… The support of Prof. Chris Evans was therefore fundamentally important as we embarked on explaining this history in context.” 

 Evans introduced the project at a launch event in Shrewsbury in May 2019, the historic conduit between rural weavers in mid\-Wales and international markets. Community research groups were subsequently established in Bangor, Machynlleth, Dolgellau, Glyn Ceiriog, and Shrewsbury. Fifty\-seven volunteers were recruited to conduct research on Negro Cloth and to disseminate knowledge of this overlooked Welsh product. The project’s volunteers were all trained using Evans’ *Slave Wales* as a set text. Evans also undertook two tours in Mid\- and North Wales in summer 2019 on behalf of Learning Links International, meeting volunteer researchers, and liaising with the institutional stakeholders, such as the Jamaica Wales Alliance, Race Council Cymru, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, and Shropshire Archives, which have supported the volunteers in their work. Evans’ role in *From Sheep to Sugar* was highlighted in the project’s final report to the National Heritage Lottery Fund \(ref. OH\-18\-03009\), and the project has been recognised as an exemplary response to the Well\-Being of Future Generations Act by the Learned Society of Wales, the national academy for arts and sciences, in its 2020 report  [*Wales Studies: Research about Wales, for Wales and the World*](https://www.learnedsociety.wales/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wales-Studies-ENG-FINAL-low-res.pdf), p. 13\) \( **S3**\). 

 There have been direct cultural outcomes. The award\-winning Welsh\-language writer  [Angharad Tomos](https://www.ylolfa.com/authors/48/angharad-tomos), who attended one of the *From Sheep to Sugar* public events, was inspired to write a Young Adult novel, *Y Castell Siwgr* \[The Sugar Castle\] \(2020\), which explores the links between Wales and Jamaica through its two teenage protagonists, one free and one enslaved \( **S4**\). 

 “I was going to write a novel about \[Jamaican plantation owner\] Lord Penrhyn. Then I heard your talk in Llanberis Slate Museum about the Negro Cloth/ Welsh flannel \- which was new to me \- so I decided to write about two young girls \- 15 year olds, \- Dorcas is from a weaving family in Dolgellau \- who goes to work as a maid in Penrhyn Castle and the other one is Ebony, an enslaved girl in Jamaica… thanks for the inspiration… it was very important for me to know that. Instead of blaming 'the other' for slavery…it made me realise how intricate the pattern is” 

 Tomos also acknowledge the importance of Evans’ work in  [promotional material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egfxVJjh5v8&t=21s) for *Y Castell Siwgr* \(in Welsh\). 

 Evans has also been able to engage with contemporary craft practitioners who have participated in the *From Sheep to Sugar* project. *From Sheep to Sugar* inspired several contemporary practitioners, recruited via weavers’, spinners’, and dyers’ guilds in Wales and the West of England, to imaginatively recreate Negro Cloth. One textile artist, Jennifer Hodgeman, having read Evans’ *Slave Wales*, designed a textile installation, “Sugar\(sic\)k”, which was exhibited at The Weir Garden, a National Trust property in Herefordshire that attracts 35,000 visitors annually, in 2019 \( **S5**\). 

 Further artistic collaborations, scheduled for 2020, are now in abeyance because of Covid\-19. 

-  Text by Evans was to have been incorporated into an installation by  [Barbara Prezeau Stephenson](https://prezeau-stephenson.com/), the internationally acclaimed Haitian visual artist and cultural activist, at the BayArt Gallery, Cardiff \( **S6**\). 

-  The history of Negro Cloth was also to have featured in the exhibition *Brethyn \(Cloth\)* at The Turner Art Gallery \(a wing of the National Museum of Wales\), Penarth \( **S7**\). 

-  Emily Laurens, co\-director of Feral Theatre, is using the  [Egin Residency](https://www.nationaltheatrewales.org/people/emily-laurens/) awarded her by National Theatre Wales to develop a theatre piece that explores the links between Welsh textiles, the use of coerced labour in the modern fashion industry, and ecological crisis \( **S8**\). 

 Cumulatively, this activity has allowed Evans to establish collaborative ties with key curatorial staff at the National Museum. During the winter of 2019\-2020 a research assistant working under Evans’ direction conducted a search of the National Museum’s collections database and archives catalogue for materials that bear upon the repressed history of Wales and Atlantic slavery. Her report was to have informed digital / pop\-up exhibitions that would, had Covid\-19 not intervened, have been made available to the National Museum site at St Fagans, which attracts an annual  [683,000](https://museum.wales/visitor-figures/cumulative-2019-20/) visitors, other outlets in Wales \(such as the Newtown Textile Museum\), and venues beyond Wales, such as the International Slavery Museum, Liverpool. 

 **The Welsh Government has recognised Evans’ expertise and appointed him to public roles as a result.** Evans is now acknowledged as a public authority on slavery, industry and landscape in Wales and more widely. This was signalled when, in the wake of Colston Must Fall in Bristol, the First Minister of Wales appointed him to an  [investigative commission](https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020-11/the-slave-trade-and-the-british-empire-an-audit-of-commemoration-in-wales.pdf) tasked with auditing public monuments, street and building names in Wales associated with Atlantic slavery. The audit was published in November 2020. It was welcomed by the First Minister with these words: 

 “Under the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, we have a duty to work towards a Wales which is more equal. To help us do this, we need a clear\-eyed understanding of the legacies of the slave trade and the British Empire. This audit provides an important evidence base, which will help us to establish an honest and more informed relationship with our history.” \( **S9**\)

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 University of Bristol research identified the value of urban habitats for pollinators and provided data for evidence\-based conservation management strategies. These were put into practice in the Greater Bristol Pollinator Strategy which has become an exemplar for developing local strategies for UK cities and informed the approach taken by the city of Stockholm. The research has informed implementation and updates to the National Pollinator Strategy for England as well as EU, Commonwealth and international conservation policy. Engagement with national policy makers and the public has raised awareness of the importance of pollinators and the role of urban habitats for conservation in the UK.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Insect pollinators provide a crucial ecosystem service but are under threat both nationally and globally with a suite of factors causing population declines. The UK Insect Pollinators Initiative, established in 2009, and funded by Defra, BBSRC, NERC, the Scottish Government, and the Wellcome Trust, aimed to provide an evidence base to inform pollinator conservation management and reduce species declines. An initial review undertaken by collaborators from across the Insect Pollinators Initiative, identified urbanisation as a key driver of pollinator decline \[2\]. Urban Pollinators: their ecology and conservation \[i\] was one of nine projects funded as part of this initiative. Under the overall lead of Prof Memmott at the University of Bristol \(UoB\), the project took place in collaboration with the Universities of Edinburgh, Leeds and Reading, across twelve UK towns and cities. 

 Using methods developed by Prof Memmott for sampling whole communities of plants and pollinators \(1999\), the project first considered the value of urban habitats for pollinators relative to farmland and nature reserves. The data revealed that urban areas can be surprisingly good for pollinators and, in particular, that bee species richness was higher in urban areas compared to nearby farmland \[3\]. A further multi\-city assessment of all major urban land uses showed residential gardens and allotments \(community gardens\) to be ‘hotspots’ for plants and pollinators, with a small increase in their area predicted to provide a large benefit for urban pollinator communities compared with other urban land uses \[5\]. 

 To assess the potential benefits of adapting urban greenspace management strategies for pollinators, the project also expanded a modelling approach developed at UoB which predicts how whole communities respond to species loss \[1\]. This was the first time that “robustness” to species loss had been used as a response variable when considering the effect of conservation management strategies. Simulating the effects of increasing abundance of three common amenity grassland plant species \(common daisy, dandelion and white clover\) demonstrated an associated increase in plant\-pollinator community robustness \[5\]. This would be straightforward to implement by simply mowing the grass less frequently, also saving public money. 

 Flower plantings \(‘urban meadows’\) have been increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. However, the floral resources these provide to flower\-visiting insects, and how these change through time, were largely unknown. UoB\-led research designed a multi\-city experiment planting 60 large urban meadows using two commercial flower\-rich seed mixes. Nectar and pollen rewards provided per plant species varied among the 65 species surveyed, with perennial seed mixes and native British weed species providing large quantities of these floral resources \[4\]. 

 The Urban Pollinators Project demonstrated significant opportunities for pollinator conservation in urban areas. Urban areas are growing worldwide and improving their value for pollinators should be part of national and international strategies to conserve and restore pollinators at a landscape level.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Pollinators are essential for 75% crop species worldwide and 35% of global food supplies. Pollinator conservation is a high\-profile global issue with national strategy documents being published for multiple countries and regions. The Urban Pollinators Project provided data \[3\-5\] for evidence\-based conservation management of pollinators in urban habitats. 

#  Shaping conservation policy and practice in the West of England 

 Practitioner partners, representing Local Authorities and local Wildlife Trusts, were involved at each of the four city hubs of the Urban Pollinators Project. In Bristol, Memmott and Baldock \(funded through a NERC KE Fellowship \[ii\]\), led a collaboration of local stakeholders; Bristol City Council, South Gloucestershire Council, University of the West of England, Avon Wildlife Trust, Buglife and Bristol Friends of the Earth, in the ‘Get Bristol Buzzing’ project to develop the Greater Bristol Pollinator Strategy \(2015\-2020\) \[Ai\]. The strategy informed greenspace management strategies in Bristol and surrounding urban areas, including changing mowing regimes to increase flower abundance and planting pollinator friendly flowers. The strategy was replicated in the city of Bath and scaled up as the West of England Pollinator Strategy incorporating Bristol City, South Gloucestershire, Bath & North East Somerset and North Somerset councils \[Aii\]. A Parks Co\-ordinator at Bristol City Council noted that her team no longer follow the traditional horticultural ‘gold standard’ of increasing use of bedding plants to improve parks, as a result of UoB research which ‘ *confirmed this annual planting was not only resource heavy but has limited benefits for urban pollinators and has since informed changes in the way my team and I manage Bristol’s urban areas for insect pollinators’* \[Bi\]. The Get Bristol Buzzing initiative established a ‘Pollinator Forum’ as well as organising a one\-day ‘Urban Pollinator Summit’ attended by 100 city council ecologists, planners, parks and greenspaces managers and Wildlife Trust conservationists for sharing knowledge and best practice. The Biodiversity Officer for South Gloucestershire stated the importance of UoB research in *‘providing a framework of understanding and the tools to change behaviours which have been and continue to be important for pollinator conservation in South Gloucestershire’* \[C\]. 

 Partner organisation Buglife explained that not only had the Urban Pollinators Project *‘laid the foundations for urban green space regeneration’* in Bristol, but that the impact *‘goes beyond Bristol however, providing the tools and knowledge to help create more valuable and connected urban landscapes for biodiversity across the UK’* \[Di\]. The Greater Bristol Pollinator Strategy \[A\] is cited in UK national advice to local authorities co\-created by Buglife and Friends of the Earth \[Dii\]. The research evidence \[3\-5\], *‘provided a portfolio of best practice examples on how to create flower\-rich green spaces, which Buglife’s Urban Buzz project continued to build on’* as well as supporting Buglife to gain *‘successful bids for additional grant funding’* for their own ‘Urban Buzz’ project \[Di\]. 

 The Urban Pollinators Project \[3\-5\] continues to influence local authority policy. The Biodiversity Officer for South Gloucestershire explained that *‘Adopting the Greater Bristol Pollinator Strategy has enabled other policies such as the biodiversity supplementary planning document and the emerging Green Space Strategy, all with the effect of allowing better management of urban areas for insect pollinators’* \[Ci\]. Most recently \(September 2020\) Bristol City Council launched the ‘One City Ecological Emergency Strategy’ which referred to data gathered during the Urban Pollinator Project \[5\]; *‘evidence shows that allotments and small holdings are some of the most biodiverse habitats in cities’*, to encourage regenerative approaches to food growing to restore habitats across the city \[Bii\]. 

#  Informing national policy 

 The evidence review carried out by the Insect Pollinators Initiative \[2\] underpinned Defra’s 2014 National Pollinator Strategy \[Fi\]. The strategy delivers across five key areas including ‘2. Supporting pollinators in towns, cities and the countryside’. Policy actions listed within this key area included the publication of a Policy and Practice Note on urban pollinators, as well as workshops on managing urban pollinators for landowners and managers \(p.17.\) \[Fi\]. Baldock led the development of this Policy and Practice Note \(2015\) outlining management strategies to benefit insect pollinators in urban areas, as part of the Living With Environmental Change Partnership, bringing together 22 public sector organisations including government departments, devolved administrations and government agencies \[E\]. In addition, Baldock led a knowledge exchange event attended by 50 representatives from Defra, local government, NGOs, industry and highways sectors \[Fii\]. Both activities were recognised in the 2016 National Pollinator Strategy progress report \[Fii\]. A 2019 evidence review \[Fiii\], co\-authored by Baldock, will underpin the ongoing update to the National Pollinator Strategy \(planned for 2020 but delayed by the COVID\-19 pandemic\). The updated strategy will follow the original five key themes, with updates to ‘Supporting pollinators across towns, cities and the countryside’ underpinned by UoB research \[1, 3\]. 

 Memmott presented findings from the Urban Pollinators Project at the Houses of Parliament and UoB research \[2\-5\] is cited in two UK parliamentary briefing notes \(September 2013, 2020\) discussing specific threats to insect populations declines \[G\]. These briefings are used by parliamentarians to advance knowledge of key issues rising on the political agenda. UoB research \[3\] is also cited in the Pollinator Strategy for Scotland 2017\-2027 Technical Annex with the Urban Pollinators Project noted as a ‘ *source of much information*’. 

#  Informing international policy and practice 

 Building on the success of the Greater Bristol Pollinator Strategy \[A\], Baldock advised the city of Stockholm, Sweden, on pollinator\-friendly management practices, doing this via a link to the British Embassy who described the document as *‘proving a very useful tool with which to galvanise various bodies into action\!’* \[H\]. The city is now officially *“changing its public flower planting regime and how it spends its budget to make sure it actively includes pollinator\-friendly plants and will integrate a pollinator\-perspective into its new Biodiversity policy”* \[H\]. Stockholm Loves Pollinators \(SLP\) has been granted funding to co\-develop various ‘demonstration sites’ in the national park to showcase good pollinator practice to the public and to work with local residents to raise awareness about supporting pollinators. Grassroots work has encouraged local residents and embassies in the city to make their properties more pollinator\-friendly and a wildflower meadow was planted by the diplomatic community on UN Biological Biodiversity Day \[H\]. 

 The importance of urban areas as habitat, particularly in intensively managed landscapes as outlined by UoB research \[3\], has been recognised in international conservation management policy documents. In 2016, Memmott and Baldock were contributing authors for, as well as cited \[3\] in, ‘The assessment report on Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production’ produced by IPBES \(Intergovernmental Science\-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\) \[J\]. This report is the blueprint for several national pollinator strategies and also the EU and FAO global initiatives. Baldock also co\-authored a report for the Commonwealth Human Ecology Council \[I\] which looks to find solutions for the declines of pollinators, and the impact on food security, across the Commonwealth. The report was launched at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta \(2015\), attended by over 100 participants including international delegates representing governments of the Commonwealth nations \[I\]. Most recently, European Commission guidance for ‘pollinator\-friendly cities’ \(2020\) \[Iii\] cited evidence from the Urban Pollinators Project \[3, 5\]. 

#  Increased public awareness 

 Memmott and Baldock have raised public awareness of the importance of urban habitats for pollinators through local, national and international engagement activities including: talks for garden and wildlife groups; pollination festivals \(seven\) each attended by more than 1,000 members of the public; freely available podcasts and videos for The Wellcome Trust, Royal Entomological Society, British Ecological Society and the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution \(‘ [How to help pollinators in cities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsypVU8VkS4)’ \(10,567 views 01/10/20\)\); as well as interviews for BBC Radio 4’s PM Programme, Farming Today, Shared Planet and Natural Histories. The Urban Pollinators Project featured in an article by Baldock for The Conversation \(2019\), and national newspapers such as The Guardian, The Daily Mail, and The Telegraph, which named it one of ten ground\-breaking research projects in the UK \(2015\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The history of Belfast is often seen, over\-simplistically, as one of sectarian conflict and deep division. Olwen Purdue’s work has challenged this perception and changed the way people think about Belfast and its past, engaging local and international audiences in an alternative, more nuanced, social history of a remarkable city at the height of its industrial might, and of the shared experience of those who lived and worked in it.  Her work has informed the interpretation of Belfast’s history by major cultural and heritage institutions. It has also reached millions of people in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and globally through television, museum exhibitions, internationally\-acclaimed visitor experiences and a community engagement project. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In a body of work spanning thirteen years, Olwen Purdue has shed an important new light on the social history of nineteenth and early twentieth\-century Belfast and its rural hinterland, providing the first detailed examination of issues such as poverty, welfare, power and agency generally overlooked in historical accounts of the region. 

 From 2007, Purdue was employed on the ESRC\-funded project, ‘Welfare Regimes under the Irish Poor Law 1850\-1921’ in which she developed new research into poverty and welfare in the north of Ireland. Her work provided the first scholarly exploration of the ways in which the poor and working classes of nineteenth\-century Ulster experienced and engaged with welfare provision in the form of the workhouse. **\(1\)** 

 Her growing body of work and expertise in the social history of Belfast and its hinterland led to a research commission from two companies \(CHL Consulting and Event Communications\) which were contracted by Titanic Foundation and Belfast City Council to develop the content of the highly\-acclaimed visitor experience, ‘Titanic Belfast’, which opened in 2012. Purdue was commissioned as academic adviser for this venture, her research and expertise shaping the content of the attraction’s opening gallery which highlights working conditions in Edwardian Belfast and outlines the social and economic context within which the *Titanic* was built.  While working on this commission, Purdue drew on themes she was identifying to edit a collection of essays on the social history of the industrial city, *Belfast: the emerging city 1850\-1914.* **\(2\)** 

 This work also led to a major AHRC\-funded project \(with Prof. Peter Gray\), ‘Welfare and Public Health in Belfast and its Hinterland 1800\-1972’. Purdue’s work focused on the period 1850\-1939 and provided the first in\-depth exploration of the challenges of poverty and engagement with welfare systems experienced by many of Belfast’s labouring classes, particularly women and children. Sole\-authored outputs from this project included an article in *Urban History* and an invited chapter in a volume on welfare regimes in Europe **\(3 & 4\).** Her work on this led to a further commission in 2013 to provide expert historical research and advice for the Ulster Museum, part of National Museums NI. Purdue advised on the content of a new permanent gallery on the history of nineteenth\-century Belfast, ‘An industrial giant and the shadow of poverty’, and wrote and presented a talking\-head audio\-visual installation which explained this aspect of Belfast’s history. In 2017, she also produced an online documentary on poverty and welfare in the city from both historic and contemporary perspectives – ‘Belfast, a tale of two cities’. **\(5\)** 

 These themes were further developed and explored within a wider geographical context and theoretical framework in Purdue’s 2018 edited collection, *Urban spaces in nineteenth\-century Ireland,* in which her own chapter investigated the ways in which Belfast’s poor navigated and challenged the constraints of welfare provision in their use of the city’s workhouse. **\(6\)** 

 Purdue’s work has shed new light on how the poor of nineteenth and twentieth century Belfast, particularly women and their families, experienced working life in the city and faced the challenges of poverty and ill\-health, how they engaged with and experienced welfare provision, and how they exercised agency in using the limited welfare options open to them. Thus it offers alternative \- and shared \- historical narratives to the more familiar ones of sectarian division and difference, and has foregrounded for the first time the histories of groups too often overlooked in the overwhelmingly masculine historical narratives of this divided city.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Purdue has worked with a range of partners to develop new, high\-impact ways of disseminating her research on the social history of industrial Belfast, challenging the predominant narratives of sectarian conflict and encouraging a deeper understanding of Belfast’s rich, and shared, social history. The main impact of her work is outlined below. 

 **1.  Impact on public awareness and understanding** 

 Through her work with Titanic Belfast, the Ulster Museum, and television, Purdue’s research has reached millions of people locally and globally. 

 As the leading expert on the social history of nineteenth and twentieth century Belfast, Purdue was commissioned in 2011 as historical advisor for **Titanic Belfast** on the recommendation of Belfast City Council. She worked with the designers on all aspects of the attraction and was responsible for developing and signing off on all historical content. However, her distinct knowledge and expertise were particularly employed in shaping the content of Gallery One \- Boomtown Belfast \- which introduces the visitor to life in Edwardian Belfast, and outlines the social and economic context in which *RMS Titanic* was built \(A\). 

 The visitor attraction opened in March 2012, and has had a significant impact since then.  By August 2019 more than **5.7 million** people had visited Titanic Belfast **\(4.9 million in the period 2013\-2020\)**; the majority \(80%\) from overseas \(B\). As each visitor follows a pre\-set route, commencing with Purdue’s ‘Boomtown Belfast’ gallery, every visitor experiences this gallery. 

 Survey evidence indicates that visitors learn a great deal from the content of Boomtown Belfast. A visitor survey carried out by Queen’s University researchers in 2019 \( *n*=419\), found that nearly all \(99%\) respondents reported having gained new knowledge from Boomtown Belfast. Two\-thirds \(66%\) said they had discovered more about the linen industry in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, while 62% said they had learned more about the ship\-building industry. Most respondents \(95%\) were tourists; among their comments were the following: “Very informative. \[I\] learned a lot about Belfast. I never would have guessed Belfast had this industry.” and “It made me aware of the rich history of Belfast and the importance of the shipping industry.” \(C\). 

 Purdue’s expertise in Belfast’s social history led to her being invited in October 2013 to become an academic advisor to the **Ulster Museum**, working with the museum in the development of an entirely new permanent gallery on the social and economic history of Belfast – ‘Industrial Giant and the Shadow of Poverty’. This used the museum’s collections to explain the industrial growth of Belfast and to engage audiences in exploring the social conditions of the time. 

 The Ulster Museum has attracted **hundreds of thousands of visitors annually** \(623,272 in 2018\-19\) with 30% of visitors coming from outside Northern Ireland, of which half have been from overseas.\(D\)  A 2015 review article concludes that the new galleries, of which Purdue’s was one, provided ‘a more nuanced approach to the interpretation of history – one forged from an interest in bringing new layers of understanding. This encourages us to think about the lives of children, women and disabled people, and creates a link between the stories of Northern Ireland and the international experience’. \(E\) 

 A visitor survey carried out by Queen’s University researchers in 2019 \( *n =115\)* focused on responses to the ‘Industrial Giant and Shadow of Poverty’ gallery. 83% of respondents said the gallery ‘improved my knowledge and understanding of nineteenth\-century Belfast’, while 52% said they now understood more about poverty in Belfast. Comments included: “The depth of information provided allowed me to make connections through history I otherwise would not have known.” \(tourist\). “I didn’t know of the strong presence of the linen industry in Belfast” \(tourist\) \(C\) 

 It is, however, through the expert advice based on her original research that Purdue has provided for **TV documentaries** that her work has reached its widest audiences. As a result of her expertise Purdue was commissioned as historical advisor and expert interviewee for a number of different programmes with a combined audience of several million.  These included: *Britain’s Hidden Heritage* \(BBC1, 2015\) \(approx. 4.25 million viewers\); *Britain’s Most Historic Towns \(Channel 4, 2018\)* and BBC NI’s 3\-part series *Family Footsteps* \(2018\). \(F\). 

 In 2018, Purdue’s work reached millions of viewers through her commission as credited historic expert and interviewee for the Channel 4 documentary, *Belfast, Britain’s most Victorian City* \(2018\).\(G\) Each episode reached an average of **1.5 million** viewers on its first airing, placing the series at Channel 4’s third highest\-viewed in that prime\-time slot over the past three years. The series has since been repeated in the UK and distributed worldwide. \(H\) 

 The beneficial learning impact of Purdue’s TV work is illustrated by the result of an online viewer survey conducted by Queen’s University researchers shortly after the two relevant episodes of *Family Footsteps* aired \( *n*=65\). More than half \(55%\) of respondents said they had gained a greater insight into life in nineteenth\-century Ulster as a result of the programme. Nearly half \(49%\) said they had a better understanding of the region’s social history, while 42% said they would like to find out more about that social history.\(C\) 

 **2. Making a major contribution to Belfast’s visitor offering and the work of cultural institutions** 

 Purdue’s research has made a vital contribution to the work of major cultural institutions and visitor experiences, enhancing their content and shaping how they engage public audiences. This has enriched the experience of those who visit them and has helped to enhance Belfast’s reputation as a tourist destination. 

 Titanic Belfast was declared the World’s Leading Visitor Attraction in the 2016 World Travel Awards, organised by the World Travel and Tourism Council \(I\). Purdue’s work has been considered pivotal to that success. Belfast City Council’s Heritage Officer stated that Purdue made ‘a particularly valuable contribution’ to the work of Titanic Belfast ‘both in terms of process and by bringing high level, specific knowledge of the social context of the period in question’. ‘A large part of the reason why the project exceeded expectations so comprehensively’, he added, ‘is the quality and authenticity of the content, firmly based on a foundation of research, to which Dr Purdue was a key and vital contributor \(I\) 

 Her research has also enhanced the Ulster Museum’s offering by contributing new social and economic historical content which provides a more nuanced, complex and diverse narrative of Ireland’s past than was previously available and has helped contextualise subsequent galleries dealing with the recent conflict in Northern Ireland. NMNI’s Head of Collections has observed that its collaboration with Dr Purdue was ‘highly productive and impactful’ and ‘enabled us to locate contested history within a broad social, human centred context’.\(J\) 

 Finally, her work as historical adviser for the Channel 4 series *Britain’s Most Historic Towns* was described by the series’ production company, IWC Media, as ‘crucial … highlight\[ing\] the most relevant areas of Victorian influence over the city, whilst ensuring that the script for the episode is historically and factually accurate’.\(K\) 

 **3. Engaging hard\-to\-reach local audiences in exploring a shared history** 

 Purdue also sought to engage local hard\-to\-reach audiences, mainly young people, in the history of their city through the project **‘Our Stories, 1932’**.  Purdue drew on her research into the city’s social history to work with Greenshoot Productions in developing a series of research workshops and activities for young people from north and east Belfast in which they researched work, life and poverty in their area during the 1930s. These groups presented their findings to an audience which included two playwrights – Martin Lynch and Gary Mitchell \- who incorporated this material into a stage play, *1932: The People of Gallagher Street.* The play ran in The MAC Theatre, to full audiences \(2\-13 November 2017, total audience: **2,253**\), helping to raise public awareness of social conditions in Belfast 

 A follow\-up audience survey, carried out by Greenshoot Productions, \( *n*=111\) found that almost all respondents \(96%\) left the play wanting to know more about this period in Belfast’s history. 77% of respondents learned something as a result of watching the play, and just under two\-thirds \(58%\) stated that the play changed the way they thought about social conditions or community relations in the 1930s. \(L\)

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Collaborative research between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce into gas turbine aerodynamics between 2005 and 2014 has led to a new compressor blade design that is now standard in all modern Rolls\-Royce civil aero engines. The developed elliptical leading edge blade technology has been used in almost 2500 new aero engines delivered since 2014, with a further almost 2,000 engines on order as of December 2019. As well as being part of new engine designs, four older generations of engines have been revised and retrofitted with the technology. For two engines alone, 45 airlines are operating aircraft equipped with this technology. The technology delivers fuel savings of 0.5% to 0.7%, which can be estimated to be delivering savings of USD219,000,000 per year for airlines.

### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There is a long\-standing collaborative research relationship between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce on fundamental research in turbomachinery. The research described below formed part of the University Gas Turbine Partnership with Rolls\-Royce, which was inaugurated in 2001 and incorporates formal processes for technology and people transfer. 

 The compressor of a gas turbine is made up of many blades \(around 4,000 in large civil engines\). The air flow over each blade is highly sensitive to the geometry of the leading edge of the blade, and changes to the geometry of the leading\-edge, and can cause the flow to separate. This separation causes the flow close to the surface to transition from laminar to turbulent and results in a significant detrimental impact on engine efficiency. Small changes in the design geometry, shape perturbations due to manufacturing variability, and in\-service shape changes due to erosion can affect whether or not flow separation occurs, and consequently impact engine efficiency. 

 Computational investigations by Professor Miller in 2004 indicated that an elliptically shaped leading edge on a modern compressor blade could stop the separation that occurred with a standard circular leading edge. This allowed the flow close to the surface to remain laminar, reducing losses and therefore improving engine efficiency. Experimental investigations of the new leading edge profiles confirmed the performance benefits suggested by the simulations. 

 The findings of the experimental investigation, supported by further numerical simulations, were published in \[R1\], showing that by switching from the standard circular leading edge to an elliptical leading edge the flow remained attached, allowing the flow close to the surface to remain laminar.  The mechanisms behind the flow features observed in \[R1\] ere investigated in \[R2\], both experimentally and computationally. It was shown in \[R2\] that the pressure close to the leading edge can exhibit a ‘spike’, and if the spike remains below a critical threshold then the separation does not occur and the engine efficiency will be unchanged. However, if the pressure spike exceeds a critical threshold, flow separation occurs, and the engine efficiency is negatively impacted. Building on the new understanding of the physical mechanisms, \[R2\] also provided design criteria for the shape of the leading edge, allowing designers to determine whether the flow over a given leading edge design would separate or not. Research in \[R3\] extended the understanding to the three\-dimensional case, and investigated the sensitivity to small geometry variations, including surface roughness, at the leading edge. The shape of the leading edge evolves over the lifetime of a blade, and \[R4\] investigated how its design shape can be made insensitive to these changes. Research in \[R3\], through considering the three\-dimensional case, showed that geometric details of the blade design, usually overlooked in the early design phases, are critical factors for overall performance and do need to be considered early in the design process.

### 1.  Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The collaborative research between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce described in section 2 has increased engine efficiency, leading to fuel savings for the airline industry. It has also provided Rolls\-Royce with commercial benefit in a market where engine efficiency is a key differentiator. 

 <ins> **Fuel savings**</ins> 

 The global airline industry fuel bill has been estimated at USD188,000,000,000 in 2019, with fuel costs accounting for 23.7% of airline operating costs \[E1\]. Therefore, small fuel efficiency gains lead to enormous cost savings for aircraft operators and major competitive benefits to engine suppliers. The elliptical leading edge technology developed provides fuel savings of between 0.5% to 0.7% \[E2, E3\]. Based on the industry’s average 12.3 daily hours of utilisation for wide\-body aircrafts and an average fuel cost of USD5000 per hour, a 0.7% fuel use reduction equates to a cost saving of USD157,000 per aircraft per year \[E4, E5\]. For the nearly 1,400 aircraft in service with elliptical leading edge turbine blades, this equates to estimated fuel savings of USD219,000,000 per year that can be attributed to the developed technology. 

 <ins> **Engine designs and deliveries**</ins> 

 The elliptical leading\-edge technology, published in \[R1, R2\], was introduced first in the Trent 1000 engine \(first delivered in 2011\) after being presented to the Trent 1000 design team by Professor Miller in 2004 \[E6\]. All later generation Rolls Royce engines for wide\-body aircraft \(Trent XWB, first delivered 2014; Trent 7000, first delivered 2018\) and the latest generation of engines for business jets \(Pearl 15, first delivered 2018; Pearl 700, first delivered 2019\) were designed with the elliptical leading edge blades \[E6, E7\]. In the period since 2014, Enhanced Performance packs for the earlier generation Trent 500, 700, 800 and 900 engines have been available \[E3\] and include the elliptical leading edge blades \[E6\]. 

 The Trent engines power some of the world’s best\-known aeroplanes, including the Boeing 777 and 787, and the Airbus A330, A330neo, A340 and A380. Over the period 2014\-2020 Rolls Royce delivered nearly 2,500 engines with the elliptical leading edge \(including new designs and updates of earlier models\) \[E7, p.15\], with a further almost 2,000 engines on order as of December 2019 \[E7, p.14\]. Deliveries in the period 2014\-2019, orders at December 2019 and engines in service at December 2019 for wide\-body engines that were designed with the elliptical leading edge blades are summarised in Table 1. Of the 510 wide\-body aircraft engines delivered by Rolls\-Royce in 2019, over 90% \(466\) were designed from the outset with the elliptical leading edge blades \[E7, p.15\]. 

| **Engine** | **Aircraft** | **Year of first delivery** | **Engine deliveries 2014\-2019** | **Engines on order \(Dec 2019\)** | **Engines in\-service \(Dec 2019\)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Trent 1000** | Boeing 787 | 2011 | 667 | 246 | 658 |
| **Trent XWB 84/97** | Airbus A350 | 2014/2017 | 846 | 1,133 | 660 |
| **Trent 7000** | Airbus A330\-800/900 \(neo\) | 2018 | 114 | 576 | 80 |
| **TOTAL** ||| 1627 | 1955 | 1398 |

 Table 1: Deliveries, orders and number in service for the Rolls Royce wide\-body Trent 1000, XWB and 7000 engines equipped with the elliptical leading edge \[E7, p.14, p.15\]. 

 The elliptical leading\-edge technology has been added to Enhanced Performance pack \(EP\) revisions of the earlier generation Trent 500 \(powers the Airbus A340\), Trent 700 \(powers the Airbus A330\), Trent 800 \(powers the Boeing 777\) and Trent 900 \(powers the Airbus A380\) engines \[E6\]. EP packs are retrofitted to existing engines and included with new deliveries of older generation designs. All 216 Trent 900 engines delivered since 2014 \[E6\] have been fitted with the elliptical leading edge \[E2\]. The EP for the Trent 700 has been available since 2009, and over the period 2014\-2019 Rolls Royce delivered 595 Trent 700 engines \[E7, p.15\]. As of December 2019, there are 1,606 Trent 700 engines in operation \[E7, p.14\] and the majority are fitted with the elliptical leading edge. The fuel savings of between 0.5% and 0.7% provided by the elliptical leading edge can be quantified by measuring the efficiency of the Trent 700 and 900 engines without \(original design\) and with the elliptical leading edge blade EP packs \[E2, E3\]. 

 <ins> **Airline operators**</ins> 

 Airlines around the world operate aircraft with engines fitted with the elliptical leading edge. The Trent XWB \(exclusive power unit for the A350\) and Trent 7000 \(exclusive power unit for the A330\-800/900 \(neo\)\) engines alone are operated by 45 carriers as of June 2020 \[E8\]. The Trent XWB powered Airbus A350 was rated in 2017 as the most fuel\-efficient aircraft used on transatlantic routes \[E9, p.9\]. 

 Efficiency is a key differentiator in the aircraft engine industry, and the elliptical leading\-edge technology has helped Rolls\-Royce gain commercial benefit in this market. 

 *“In 2004 Rob Miller spent his summer in Rolls\-Royce investigating the impact of leading\-edge shape on compressor performance. This computational work showed that leading\-edge shape could cause a 20%\-30% change in the profile loss of a blade row. This led to the Trent 1000 project funding testing in the Whittle Lab that showed that leading\-edge shape could change profile loss of a blade row by 24%, and helped to support the Trent 1000 team's confidence that Elliptical Leading Edges should be implemented on the Trent 1000. This is a great example of how the long relationship between Rolls\-Royce and the Whittle Laboratory helps to ensure that technology is successfully transferred into product.”*

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2016, researchers at Queen Mary discovered an “exoplanet” \(Proxima b\) orbiting our nearest star. This is the nearest such planet ever to be discovered. It is in the habitable zone where liquid water can exist, making it possible that the planet could harbour life. The discovery informed international science policy, causing the European Southern Observatory to reassess its approaches to allocating telescope time and distributing news to the public. It also directly inspired and defined the course of private space exploration, resulting in the launch of an observational programme and spacecraft\-based initiative focused on the Proxima Centauri system. Proxima b inspired the creation of numerous valuable cultural artefacts, including documentary films, literature, music and video games. It strongly engaged large, diverse audiences with astronomy, as evidenced by activity on news media websites, social media, and online learning resources.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 “Are we alone in the Universe?” This question has fascinated researchers for thousands of years, and continues to do so as scientists scour the cosmos for planets around other stars \(‘exoplanets’\) that may be able to sustain life. Each star has its own ‘habitable zone’, a band of space in which an orbiting body can sustain liquid water, widely thought to be a necessary condition for life. Hunting for planets that orbit within this zone around other stars is, therefore, a crucial step in our search for life in the Universe. 

 Dr. Anglada\-Escudé has long\-standing expertise in exoplanet hunting. One of the methods typically used to detect exoplanets is the radial velocity *,* or Doppler method, by which the presence of a planet can be detected by hunting for shifts in the light of the host star. This method is more difficult than alternatives, but can be applied to many more stars, making it hugely promising. Prior to joining Queen Mary, Anglada\-Escudé worked to increase the precision of this technique by developing new algorithms, thus creating a new method, named Template\-Enhanced Radial velocity Re\-analysis Application \(TERRA\). This method has been used to analyse data from the world’s most precise radial velocity instrument, the European Southern Observatory’s High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher, or HARPS, via the ‘HARPS\-TERRA’ software tool. Anglada\-Escudé’s research at Queen Mary focused on combining archival data with new observations made using his TERRA technique, and resulted in discoveries such as that of two small planets around an M\-dwarf star \(with one in the habitable zone\) \[3.1\]. 

 The success of the HARPS\-TERRA framework led Anglada\-Escudé to search for exoplanets around the nearest star to our own: Proxima Centauri. Anglada\-Escudé used several smaller telescopes around the globe in conjunction with HARPS to monitor the star system continuously for two months, logging results at the same time each evening, which is typically not possible given the way in which telescope time is usually allocated. Anglada\-Escudé named the project ‘Pale Red Dot’ and maintained a popular science blog describing the search methods and results as they happened. The project culminated in August 2016 with the discovery of a planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri \[3.2\-3.3\], Proxima b, the closest exoplanet ever discovered \(Figure 1\).

 Queen Mary’s Dr.Anglada\-Escudé used his previously developed framework, HARPS\-TERRA, to discover Proxima b, an exoplanet within the habitable zone of the nearest star to our own Sun, Proxima Centauri. This has driven numerous wide\-ranging impacts: it has informed international policy on telescope time allocation and public engagement; inspired and shaped the course of private space exploration; created valuable cultural artefacts; and led to increased levels of public engagement and awareness of astronomy. 

#  Informing international policy at ESO 

 Anglada\-Escudé’s discovery of Proxima b caused the European Southern Observatory \(ESO\), a 16\-nation intergovernmental research organisation for ground\-based astronomy, to adjust its policies for a\) allocation of telescope time and b\) public engagement. 

 *Allocation of telescope time*: ESO now allows researchers to obtain short time slots at similar times each night, a crucial factor in the discovery of Proxima b. This strategy, under which observation runs typically last for at least three nights, “really deviated from the norm”, according to Ferdinando Patat, Head of Observing Programmes Office at ESO, and was first approved on the 3.6m HARPS telescope at Anglada\-Escudé’s request. As a result of the high\-profile success of this approach, ESO now offers it in their updated ‘call for proposals’ documentation and has implemented the technique regularly since 2016 \[5.2\]. 

 *Public engagement:* As a result of the success of the Proxima b campaign, the ESO now also does Reddit ‘ask me anything’ \(AMA\) sessions for new campaigns, in addition to their press conferences. This is because they found the sessions “an excellent opportunity to have a more in\-depth science conversation with members of the public,” according to Anna\-Lynn Wegener. Head of Communication Department at ESO. “The scientists also enjoy the opportunity to explain their results and engage directly with the public.” Wegener’s team has given more attention to training their press conference speakers. The training now includes a simulated Q&A session to help speakers to deliver “clearer, more coordinated and easier to understand \[messages\]” \[5.3\]. 

#  Inspiring and changing the course of private space exploration: Targeting Proxima b 

 The ‘Breakthrough Starshot’ programme \(part of Breakthrough Initiatives\) was founded by Yuri Milner, Mark Zuckerberg and Stephen Hawking in 2016. Breakthrough Starshot aims to develop a proof\-of\-concept fleet of tiny nanocraft \(‘StarChips’\) capable of travelling to the Alpha Centauri system to seek evidence of life. The programme’s CEO attended the Proxima b press conference and described the discovery as “truly inspirational”, explaining that they “hope to build a privately\-funded prototype system costing between USD500,000,000 and USD1,000,000,000. We are really excited and, to use the US term, ‘pumped’, about this discovery. We are on our way\!” \[5.4\]. Breakthrough Starshot co\-founder Stephen Hawking later confirmed that the StarChips should take 20 years to reach Proxima b \(at 20% of the speed of light\) and said that “Once there, the nanocraft could image any planets discovered in the system, test for magnetic fields and organic molecules, and send the data back to Earth in another laser beam” \[5.5\]. Milner further estimated the total future cost of the Breakthrough Starshot programme at USD5\-10,000,000,000, with first probes sent in 2036 \[5.6\]. 

 In January 2017, Breakthrough Initiatives signed an agreement with ESO to collaborate on a multi\-million\-dollar astronomical programme \(‘Breakthrough Watch’\) to hunt for other planets that may be present in the Alpha Centauri system. Informed and guided by the discovery of Proxima b, observations began in May 2019, with press releases emphasising the motivation provided by Proxima b as “an Earth\-like planet in our own cosmic back yard” \[5.7\]. Breakthrough Watch will enhance the design of space\-based and extra\-large ground\-based telescopes to optimise planet detection – aims that would lead to huge advances in astronomical discovery, and have been strongly influenced by Anglada\-Escudé’s work \[5.7\]. 

#  Creation of new cultural artefacts: Influential and wide\-ranging output 

 In 2017, Anglada\-Escudé was listed as one of Time magazine’s \(print readership: 26,000,000; circulation: 2,300,000; monthly browsers: 27,100,000\) ‘100 most influential people of the year’, and received both The Guardian’s Higher Education award for Research Impact and The Times’ Higher Education award for ‘Research Project of the Year’. The discovery was front page news around the world. It was included as one of the *BBC’s* \(monthly browsers: 38,600,000\) top six ‘Amazing Science Stories’ of 2016, chosen as one of *The Guardian’s* \(print readership: 3,600,000; circulation: 111,953; monthly browsers: 25,100,000\) ‘12 Key Science Moments of 2016’ and was  [mentioned in over 4,200 news articles](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/mar/30/research-impact-category-award-winner-and-runners-up) in the week following the paper’s publication in *Nature*. The intense media interest focused on \(i\) Proxima b being the closest exoplanet to Earth ever discovered and \(ii\) the planet’s location in the habitable zone around Proxima Centauri, making it a promising candidate for extra\-terrestrial life. 

 The discovery inspired the widespread creation of new cultural artefacts, including: 

-  *Documentary films:* the BBC’s ‘The Search for a New Earth’, Amazon Prime’s ‘Journey to the Pale Red Dot’; 

-  *Music:* the music streaming service ‘Spotify’ currently lists over 100 distinct tracks named after Proxima b; 

-  *Science fiction literature:* the ‘Proxima Rising’ trilogy by Brandon Q. Morris, which discusses how aliens on the planet cope with solar flares from the Sun, a key current research topic concerning the potential habitability of the planet. The first book in the series has sold 81,000 copies in German and English in at least 8 countries; 

-  *Science non\-fiction literature:* the Lonely Planet travel guide to ‘The Universe’ features a significant discussion of Proxima b and its potential for habitability; 

-  *Video games:* ‘Proxima Royale’, a competitive science fiction multiplayer shooter set on Proxima b; the educational game ‘Space Odyssey’ which allows players to “embark on exploration missions … starting ... with the exoplanet named Proxima B”, crowd\-funded by Neil De Grasse Tyson \( [7207 backers pledged a total of $357,866](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2000580152/neil-degrasse-tyson-presents-space-odyssey-the-vid)\); and a Proxima b update for the popular ‘Universe Sandbox’; 

-  *Popular comedy:* the satirical website *The Daily Mash* carried the article ‘Closest Earth\-like planet best hope of getting on property ladder’, whose related Facebook post was shared over 2,500 times and gained over 375 comments and over 10,000 ‘likes’\). 

#  Increased public awareness of and engagement with astronomy 

 
By engaging a large, diverse audience with astronomy, Anglada\-Escudé's discovery has advanced public debate about extra\-terrestrial life. Since the finding, topics related to astronomy, exoplanets, and Proxima Centauri have seen a marked increase in engagement. On Twitter, the number of global retweets per year containing the keywords “Proxima Centauri” was over 23 times higher during the discovery year, indicating active engagement, with a sustained increase \(nearly 8 times higher on average\) post\-discovery compared to pre\-discovery \(Figure 2\) \[5.1\]. Tweets containing “Proxima Centauri” received three times more retweets if they also contained the word “habitable” and, in the same dataset, tweets containing “habitable”, “water”, “alien”, or “life” dramatically increased after the 2016 discovery, an increase that has continued through to early 2020. 

 Roughly 30% more people read about Proxima Centauri per month on Wikipedia post\-discovery than pre\-discovery, amounting to 20,000 extra views per month. The Pale Red Dot project website also saw a significant increase in unique visitors per month, rising from 1,200 in the month pre\-discovery to 15,200 in the discovery month. 

 An analysis of nearly 5000 comments from BBC, *Daily Mail* \(print readership: 2,200,000; circulation: 990,106; monthly browsers: 37,100,000\) and *The Guardian* news articles \(2016\-2020\) showed that “likes” \(or similar reactions\) are associated with the terms “habitable”, “alien”, “religion” and “travel”. Comments on online news reports show that audiences are developing new knowledge as a result of engagement. Specific comments include *“*It's great that we are getting better at detecting exoplanets” \(BBC\) and “This is stunning news. A habitable world around the closest star to us” \( *Daily Mail*\). Posts related to Proxima b on Reddit, a community discussion site with 330,000,000 users, peaked along with the discovery in 2016. Following this peak, activity continued at a sustained level of approximately 4.7 posts per week in 2017–19. The Reddit communities with the highest proportion of Proxima b posts include one focused on creative writing and another dedicated to “exhibiting the awesome potential of humanity”, indicating that Proxima b has uniquely captured public imagination beyond typical astronomy\-interested audiences.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This research project and associated public engagement has championed the artistic and cultural significance of the Lancastrian/Mexican surrealist, Leonora Carrington, through publicising her work regionally, nationally and internationally via curatorial initiatives, screenings, public events, and close participation in the development and production of two recent feature length films about the artist. The research has uncovered \(1\) the under\-recognized links between Carrington’s creative practice and the medium of film; and \(2\) a collection of the artist’s juvenile paintings that had not previously been the subject of scholarly study. The related collaborative activities with key organisations, such as Tate Liverpool, Arts Council England and Fundación Leonora Carrington \(Mexico\) have played a vital role in bringing under\-represented and previously unexhibited work of the artist to wider public attention. 

 The research has: 

-  Stimulated the development of a new and vibrant cultural partnership between Edge Hill University and Tate Liverpool widening the cultural offerings in the region. 

-  Increased local cultural awareness and knowledge of work and life of Leonora Carrington whilst adding to the cultural heritage of North West England. 

-  Contributed to the development and production of two significant documentary films about Leonora Carrington further widening cultural awareness of the artist. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Leonora Carrington, who died in 2011 in Mexico City as a renowned Mexican artist, was celebrated as the last living surrealist. Although born in 1917 in Clayton Le Woods, Lancashire, her work has been virtually unrecognized by the general public in her native Britain. Initially associated with Max Ernst and André Breton’s surrealist circle in Paris, Carrington reached artistic independence by developing her creative practice across a range of artistic disciplines, including painting, sculpture, tapestry, creative writing, theatrical experiments and cinematic involvements on and off screen. The scholarship on Carrington’s *oeuvre* has favoured the paintings from her Mexican period \(1942 – 2011\), while the interrelation between her work and the medium of film, and the artist’s early formation have gained limited academic attention. 

 The research activities on the project started in 2014 when Shannon proposed to Tate Liverpool to organize a Leonora Carrington retrospective that would raise public awareness of the artist’s cultural and artistic significance within regional and national context. The research for the exhibition involved interviews with members of Carrington’s extended family who provided a selection of Leonora Carrington’s juvenile paintings from the mid\-1930s, previously unexhibited to wider audiences. Initiated by Shannon, the cinematic element in the retrospective – screenings of the Mexican film *The Mansion of Madness* \(Juan López Moctezuma, 1973\), art directed by Leonora Carrington – triggered further in\-depth research into the links between the artist’s interdisciplinary creativity and the medium of film. As argued in the 2019 publication \[1\], because Carrington’s creative practice does not directly include filmmaking, the artist’s collaborations on and off screen have been relatively ignored, yet Carrington’s cinematic mediations reveal important aspects of her artistic identity. The research focused on Carrington’s cameo appearances in two 1960s Mexican productions — *There Are No Thieves in This Village* \(Alberto Isaac, 1964\) and *A Pure Soul* \(Juan Ibáñez, 1965\) – that mark the artist’s creative collaborations with Surrealist film director Luis Buñuel and magic realist novelists Gabriel García Márquez and Carlos Fuentes. Analyses of Carrington’s visual and literary works has revealed a series of recurring Surrealist tropes, autobiographical elements and motifs that, Shannon and Markova argue, are also evident in her cinematic work. The published work explores how Carrington’s references to anti\-Catholic and anti\-bourgeois satire and her feminist position – which can be traced to the artist’s early life and experiences in Lancashire \- are realised in the artist’s on\-screen cameos. The research has analysed the intertextual translations between Carrington’s paintings and her cinematic set design and revealed Carrington’s creative approach towards art directing and costume design, manifested in Moctezuma’s surrealist film, *The Mansion of Madness*, and contextualized within her earlier experiments with theatrical scenography. 

 A publication initially submitted in 2019 and resubmitted to another journal in 2020 \[2\] explores Carrington’s artistic and cultural identity arguing that early experiences of home at Crookhey Hall in Lancashire, her later self\-imposed exile and revolt against patriarchy were central to the formation of a cross\-cultural imaginary realised in the artist’s mature visual and literary works. The article offers a detailed examination of the rhetorical and aesthetic strategies used across a series of five documentary films about Carrington. The films analysed in the article were produced in Mexico, UK, USA and Spain and include *Leonora Carrington: The Lost Surrealist* \(2017\), one of two documentaries that credit Shannon as an advisor. The article argues that the documentaries succeed in rendering Carrington’s artistic identity as a hybrid entity and utilise domestic spaces to evoke a sense of displacement.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Shannon’s research on Carrington’s early life, screen\-based collaborations and artistic and cultural identity have led to partnerships, advisory roles, and public engagement activities. Research on the artist’s formative years in Lancaster and her later cinematic work prompted a major exhibition at Tate Liverpool which increased the knowledge and appreciation of Carrington’s life and legacy. The innovative exhibition and partnership with Tate Liverpool stimulated interest from filmmakers who benefitted from Shannon’s research and advice on the development of Carrington’s artistic identity and her previously underexamined cinematic collaborations. These activities have grown the reach of Carrington’s work whilst also widening the public consciousness of a previously under\-represented artist. 

###  Development of a new cultural partnership between Edge Hill University and Tate Liverpool 

 In 2014 Shannon pitched a proposal to the Tate Liverpool’s Executive Artistic Directors to host a Leonora Carrington exhibition that would uncover unrecognized aspects of the artist’s creative practice, acknowledge her Lancastrian heritage and \(re\)discover the artist’s cultural significance in Britain, and specifically in north west England. This proposal came to fruition in March 2015 with Shannon being appointed as a Special Projects Advisor consulting, firstly, on Carrington’s involvements in cinema and, secondly on the place and heritage of Lancashire in her work. To realise the retrospective, Shannon collaborated with Tate Liverpool’s curator, Tate Liverpool’s Artistic Director, and the Mexican novelist, Chloe Aridjis, was invited to co\-curate the exhibition. The exhibition was the stimulus for the development of a formal cultural partnership between Edge Hill University and Tate Liverpool as confirmed in the Tate’s annual report from 2015 \[A\]: 

 “The development of the Leonora Carrington exhibition as part of Tate Liverpool’s Surreal Landscapes spring 2015 programme has offered the ideal opportunity to explore the shared values between the two institutions and to formalise a larger partnership spanning across the university \[…\] Working together on the exhibition has built a positive relationship and has brought value to both the exhibition at Tate Liverpool and to teaching, learning and research activities within Edge Hill University”. 

 For example, the partnership yielded further collaborations that include knowledge exchange events through the Tate Exchange programme and public talks linked to Tate exhibitions hosted by the University, widening the cultural offerings in the region. The Leonora Carrington exhibition was directly informed and stimulated by Shannon’s research as confirmed by Head of Learning at Tate Liverpool \[B\]: “Professor Shannon’s research into the relationship between Carrington’s work and film and her cultural and artistic identity was the prompt and stimulus behind the exhibition \[…\] Professor Shannon collaborated with Tate Liverpool’s Artistic Director, Francesco Manacorda, and the exhibition’s co\-curator, Lauren Barnes, taking on a role as Special Projects advisor regarding both the film element and the Lancastrian connections”. 

###  Increasing local cultural awareness and knowledge of work and life of Leonora Carrington and adding to the cultural heritage of North West England 

 The exhibition was displayed at Tate Liverpool for 3 months, March – May 2015 and explored Carrington’s diverse creative practice, and displayed key paintings from throughout her career, including ‘El Mundo Mágico de los Mayas’, which travelled out of Mexico for the first time. The exhibition also drew on Shannon’s research on Carrington’s involvement in film leading to the inclusion in the exhibition of a screening of *The Mansion of Madness* \(dir. Juan López Moctezuma, Mexico, 1973\), for which Leonora Carrington was Art Supervisor. “This attention to Carrington and film represented the first time that this aspect of her wide creative practice had been incorporated in such an exhibition and it has since influenced the curatorship of subsequent Carrington exhibitions.” \[B\] 

 The exhibition its promotion and marketing and associated learning programme had a wide reach including \[A\]: 

-  Marketing and promotions materials generated by Tate Liverpool had a reach of over 1,000,000 people. 

-  Over 15,000 people attended the exhibition. 

-  553 people attended events programmed in collaboration with Edge Hill University. 

-  128 people attended Tate Liverpool public events. 

-  340 school students visited the exhibition and 26 schools received tours, with resources available for schools and teachers for self\-directed learning. 

-  32 people attended two distance learning talks about the Leonora Carrington exhibition, delivered through the Tate website. 

-  827 children and their families attended drop in Surrealist Family Adventure family 

 activity sessions. 

-  10,759 parents and children accessed the Family Room in the Clore Learning Centre to visit Pompompom, a family activity installation inspired by the Surrealist Landscapes season. 

 The Head of Learning at Tate Liverpool confirms that the legacy of the exhibition has been “an increased awareness and understanding of the artistic work and creative diversity of Leonora Carrington. It also significantly added to the interpretation of the cultural heritage of the north west by highlighting the under acknowledged Lancastrian origins of the artist” \[B\] 

 In addition to the Tate exhibition, in 2016 Shannon was invited to organize a public discussion on the connection between Carrington’s work and film, followed by a screening of *The Mansion of Madness* for the Viva\! Spanish & Latin American Festival at HOME, Manchester \[F\]. In 2018 Shannon’s research on Leonora Carrington’s on\-screen collaborations and cameo performances in two Mexican avant\-garde films from the 1960s has been reflected in a screening programme within the “Leonora Carrington: Magical Tales” exhibition organized by Mexico City’s Museum of Modern Art \(MAM\) and Monterrey’s Museum of Contemporary Art \(MARCO\) in Mexico \[E\]. In 2015 the Institute for Creative Enterprise at Edge Hill University ran an evening ‘In conversation with Leonora Carrington’ to a live audience, the subsequent YouTube video has received over 1600 views. 

###  Contribution to the development and production of two significant documentary films about Leonora Carrington leading to wider awareness across the UK 

 Shannon’s research has made a significant contribution to the development and production of two documentary films that chronicled the life and work of Leonora Carrington. Shannon was approached by the producers of the BBC commissioned film *Leonora Carrington: The Lost Surrealist* \[C i\]. Shannon was formally thanked in the credits of the film. His advice stemming from the research informed the producers of the artist’s associations with film and filmmakers alongside the artist’s Lancastrian heritage, connection and influence. The producer of the documentary confirms that they “…had a number of conversations with Roger Shannon touching on the research he had embarked upon at the University regarding Leonora Carrington. His advice and the discussions we had were helpful. We were able to thank him in the film’s credits, something the BBC doesn’t do lightly” \[C ii\]. The film went on two win two awards – the 2018 Royal Television Society Northern Ireland Award for ‘Best Specialist Factual’: and the prestigious 2018 Grierson Trust British Documentary Award for Best Arts or Music Documentary \[C iii\]. The Grierson jury noted in their comments that the film had been particularly successful in ‘connecting the subject's biography and inner life to the subject’s art in a surefooted way’, a notable feature of Shannon’s research. 

 More fundamentally as confirmed by the production company the film and the associated publicity were able to reach a large audience across two screenings on BBC 4 \(November 2017 and December 2018\) alongside screenings at documentary film festivals and by European broadcasters. As the producer confirms “the film, alongside Professor’s Shannon’s research, was able to make more people aware of the life and work of a wonderful artist who had been ‘lost’ to a great many in the UK and wider world. I recognise that Professor Roger Shannon’s research interests at Edge Hill University also achieve this goal, and as such we were grateful to share in that endeavour” \[C ii\]. 

 Shannon’s research at Edge Hill University also made a significant and wide\-reaching contribution to the development, writing, financing, and production of a second film *Female Human Animal*. The director of this film confirms, *“*The work undertaken at Edge Hill University about this artist helped me directly not only in research but in contributing to developing, writing, financing and producing the film. At a crucial point in the post production of the film, we were able to draw on Professor Shannon's research in very practical ways. On numerous occasions I discussed the film’s approach with Professor Shannon, responding with amendments to the script… approach of the film with regard to Carrington’s work, life, history, and related concerns of surrealism, feminism and gender relations that inform the film’s thematics, which greatly improved the impact of the film.” \[D i\]. 

 The film was shown initially at Sheffield Documentary Festival followed by over 20 theatrical screenings across the UK and a number of international film festivals \[D ii\].  The film was also distributed by the online distributor MUBI to over 150 territories including the UK and the USA, as well as being available on the BFI player, further widening the chance for raising public awareness of the artist.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 We all sit too much. Spending long periods of time sitting increases rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, mental health issues and all\-cause mortality. Researchers at the University of Leicester tackled this growing health problem through the creation and implementation of the freely available Stand More AT Work \(SMART Work\) programme, enabling organisations and individuals worldwide to reduce sitting and move more at work. This programme and unique underpinning research have changed clinical guidelines, informed national initiatives and facilitated the development of self\-monitoring tools such as the Fitbit movement reminder and sit\-stand desks for IKEA. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Leicester sedentary behaviour researchers \(LSBRs\), led by Edwardson and Yates, began with three main aims: 

 i. Understand the role of sedentary behaviour on morbidity and mortality. 

 ii. Examine the health effects of reducing and breaking sitting time with light physical activity. 

 iii. Develop and test the effectiveness and cost\-effectiveness of free\-living sitting reduction interventions on behaviour, health and work outcomes 

 The need for this research was clear and supported by GBP7,000,000 in funding from the NIHR, Department of Health and MRC **\[G1–G3\]**.Ground\-breaking systematic reviews and meta\-analyses published by LSBRs in 2012 \(\~2000 citations\) demonstrated that people with high levels of sedentary behaviour had an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all\-cause mortality **\[R1, R2\].** From this point, LSBRs have remained at the forefront internationally in furthering understanding of the relationship between sedentary behaviour, particularly when measured by wearable devices \(i.e., accelerometers\), and cardiometabolic health. 

 Epidemiological evidence published by LSBRs, showed that device\-assessed sedentary time was positively associated with two\-hour glucose, triglycerides, adiposity, MRI\-assessed heart, liver and visceral fat, inflammation, all\-cause mortality and negatively with HDL cholesterol **\[R3, R4, R5, G2, G3\]**. Importantly, their research showed a substantially higher risk of death with ≥9.5 hours/day of device\-assessed sedentary time; >60,000 downloads; Altmetric score 2586 \(top 5% and listed in the 2019 Altmetric Top 100 list\) **\[R5\]**. These outputs comprise part of the suite of epidemiological research conducted by LSBRs which has generated new hypotheses for experimental and intervention research globally.LSBRs validated their epidemiological observations via a series of acute experimental studies. These confirmed that reducing sitting time across the day through short, frequent bouts of light activity \(standing, walking and arm ergometry for five minutes every half hour\) considerably improved markers of diabetes and identified key groups that would benefit more from such an intervention; females, South Asians, those with lower fitness levels or higher BMI **\[R6, G2,G3\]**. 

 Building on this evidence, LSBRs collaborated with researchers at Loughborough University to develop a sitting reduction intervention: SMART Work \(Stand More AT Work\). The programme aimed to reduce sitting time by 60 minutes per day and targeted one of the most sedentary populations: office workers. The randomised controlled trial was funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme **\[G1\]** and remains one of the largest of its kind internationally **\[R7\].** Results demonstrated that provision of education, height\-adjustable workstations and additional behaviour change strategies led to large reductions \(83 min/day\) in sitting time after 12 months. These positive changes also gave demonstrable quality of life improvements, reductions in musculoskeletal issues and improvements in self\-reported job performance, work engagement, occupational recovery and sickness presenteeism; >50,000 downloads; Altmetric score 589 \(top 5%\); news outlets 43 **\[R7\]**. The cost\-benefit analysis showed a potential return on investment of GBP3 on every GBP1 spent as a result of increased productivity of 1.75 hours per week—a net saving of GBP1,770.32 per employee **\[R8\].** Due to the success of the intervention, it was scaled up for rollout nationally and internationally.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 LSBR's research has affected global change across a wide range of areas. Their work has defined guidelines, changed working practices, improved occupational health, and enabled individuals to make effective behaviour change. 

 **Changing Guidelines** 

 As a result of their established expertise and demonstrable success, LSBRs were invited to provide expert contributions to the first ever expert statement on sedentary behaviour levels in the workplace ‘The Sedentary Office’. This statement \(>130,000 downloads; Altmetric score 1201 \(top 5%\); news outlets 97\), recommended that workers should aim to spend 50% of their working day upright and was aimed primarily at employers and staff working in office environments but has also been utilised by ergonomists, office furniture and equipment suppliers and occupational health promoters **\[E1\]**. 

 The expert statement provided impetus for widespread changes to clinical practice and working guidelines for which LSBR provided pivotal guidance and evidence. In 2019, the UK Chief Medical Officer published new ‘UK Physical Activity Guidelines’ for which Yates provided expertise as a member of the sedentary behaviour expert working group. LSBR research provides much of the evidence for the guidance and specifically underpins the recommendation to interrupt prolonged periods of sitting with light physical activity **\[E2\]**. Furthermore, Dempsey is a member of the guideline development group that updated the World Health Organisation’s physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines for 2020 **\[E3\]**. 

 LSBR research has also gone on to underpin international guidelines and position statements covering sedentary behaviour. This includes: the Dutch Physical Activity Guidelines 2017; Physical Activity/Exercise and Diabetes Position Statement of the American Diabetes Association 2016; the 2018 USA Physical Activity Guidelines; the Canadian 24\-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults; the World Health Organisation’s guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour 2020; recommended interventions for increased physical activity among office workers by the Swedish Department for Public Health 2019; the National Heart Foundation of Australia’s ‘Blueprint for Active Australia’ 2019 **;** the American Cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention; the European Association of Preventive Cardiology position statement on exercise training for patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease; the joint statement of the British and Canadian Associations of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation; the International Council for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation; and the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences on 'Acute glycaemic management before, during and after exercise for cardiac rehabilitation participants with diabetes mellitus' **\[E4\]**. 

 **Improving Occupational Health** 

 In 2019, the SMART Work programme was launched online \(rebranded SMART Work and Life in late 2020\). Building on the successful SMArT Work intervention **\[R7, R8\]** the programme is freely available for use by organisations, workplace champions or individual employees **\[E5\]**. It consists of online education, motivational posters, sitting less challenges, suggestions for environmental changes, free self\-monitoring tools, action plans, case studies, top tips and a step\-by\-step guide for effective implementation. To date, employees from >225 national and international \(Australia, New Zealand, USA, Canada, Europe\) organisations have signed up. These organisations include: Caterpillar UK Ltd., 30 councils across England, NHS Trusts, Pharmaceutical companies \(e.g., Sanofi\), Universities, and Government agencies \(e.g., HMRC\). Furthermore, this programme has been endorsed by three height\-adjustable desk provider companies, including Posturite, Sit\-stand.com \(through ActiveWorking.com\), and COI Total Interiors and is being promoted on their websites, through their newsletters, blogs and webinars. The programme has also featured on the Affinity Health at Work’s website and social media, WorkSpace Design and Build through an invited blog, in the Institution of Occupational Health and Safety \(IOSH; a global organisation for health and safety individuals\) news stories and a featured blog, and on BBC Radio Leicester. Edwardson was also an invited speaker at the Health and Safety Executive \(one of the UK government agencies responsible for workplace health\) **\[E6\]**. 

 **Enabling Individuals to Make Effective Change** 

 Fitbit is the world leader in wearable physical activity trackers with over 29,570,000 active users worldwide. A core function common across the entire Fitbit product portfolio is step counting and in 2016 they introduced a vibration reminder to the user should they be sedentary for too long to achieve at least 250 steps per hour. Fitbit introduced this feature as a direct result of LSBR research linking sedentary time to increased risk of chronic disease and reduced cardiometabolic health **\[E7\]**. 

 In 2016, LSBR research also enabled and underpinned the development and release of the Outstanding google chrome extension. Outstanding analyses computer input to determine levels of sitting and provide break reminders and cites LSBR research as both its inspiration and the evidence base **\[E8\].** This has had \~500 downloads. 

 As a result of the meta\-analyses published in 2012 **\[R1, R2\]**, LSBR were invited, in 2013, by the Global Business Leader of the Workspace Range of IKEA, Sweden, to attend and present at a workshop on the impact of sitting on health and to explore with them ways to reduce sitting with workspace furnishings and ways of working. This workshop included LSBR, a potential furnishing supplier and IKEA leaders. The main output of the workshop was ideas for a range development and a case for manufacturing workspace furnishings to reduce sitting at scale **\[E9\]**. Subsequently, in late 2014, IKEA released its first range of motorised sit\-stand desks \(BEKANT range\). These desks are proving popular with 21 desks now in the BEKANT range and eight in the IDASEN range, with sales of these desks increasing by 15% during 2019 **\[E9\]**. 

 ‘The Sedentary Office’ fed into the development of a Desk Control App by LINAK \(>50,000 downloads on the Google Play store\), which pairs with electric sit\-stand desks and provides reminders to change posture from sit to stand and vice versa and provides feedback on standing time **\[E10\]**. 

 LSBR research has also inspired the design of a chair launched by Movably in 2020 \(with LSBR meta\-analysis results highlighted on their homepage\), which enables the user to switch between a seated and standing position and when standing, stand more comfortably. The associated app provides feedback on time spent sitting and standing and number of posture changes **\[E11\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Ferry’s research into public sector audit and accountability has significantly changed United Kingdom \(UK\) government thinking and policy making, which has in turn enhanced public accountability of local government spending. Ferry’s work with the House of Commons \(HoC\) Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee \(HCLG\) was followed by the government of the UK ordering a major review of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014. The review by Sir Tony Redmond, the only high\-level review in recent years focussed on public sector audit and financial reporting, engaged Ferry as a central part of the Steering Panel and made many recommendations based on Ferry’s findings. The Redmond Review’s report, published in September 2020, calls for a comprehensive overhaul of the current regulatory arrangements including primary legislation to establish a “new regulatory body responsible for procurement, contract management, regulation, and oversight of local audit”. The UK Government responded to this review in December 2020, and is already in agreement with 60% of the recommendations; most of the remaining recommendations are being further considered by the Government before they make a further response. Ferry’s research and engagement with the public audit community has also translated into changes to the National Audit Office \(NAO\) Code of Audit Practice \(published April 2020\). The effect of the changes in government thinking, the Redmond review and NAO Audit Code will radically improve financial resilience of Local Authority spending and its efficacy for local populations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 \(LAA Act 2014\) was the most significant regulatory change in over three decades to public audit, bringing in ‘new’ audit and inspection arrangements, for English local government and other local public bodies. It finalised the closure of the Audit Commission originally announced in 2010, thereby fundamentally changing the English local government regulatory system \(R4\). The changes from the LAA Act 2014 are critical for public service delivery, as England’s 365 local authorities are the main conduit for public expenditure in England, with a net revenue budget of over GBP95billion for 2018/19, over 20% of total UK public sector expenditure. The impact of local government is also highly significant to other public services \(such as Education, NHS, Police, Fire Services\) due to joint work; and to the private sector, due to the effect on local communities and the extent of public service delivery and commissioning involving private sector partners. Therefore, the accountability of local authority finances is of high significance to social value in terms of the social, economic and environmental wellbeing of citizens across England \(R3\). 

 Against the backdrop of the 2014 Act, Ferry has undertaken detailed qualitative and quantitative research into financial resilience, value for money and fairness in English local government, during a period when the central government operated a policy of ‘austerity\-localism’, \(significant cuts to local government budgets whilst at the same time affording local authorities substantially more power to make decisions locally\) which radically changed accountability regimes for public services \(R2\-R6\). 

 An overarching motivation for Ferry’s body of work is that public audit’s purpose is to create accountability for the state and democracy \(R3, R4\). The post\-Audit Commission public audit regime includes financial audit, giving an opinion on financial accounts, and whether Value for Money \(VfM\) arrangements are in place, but the inspection elements of audit, which determine whether VfM and fairness has been achieved, have been removed \(R3\). A key finding from Ferry’s research is that the current focus on financial stewardship can be to the detriment of VfM \(R3, R4, R6\) and fairness \(R3, R4\). He highlighted challenges for the new accountability regime that included the fact that transparency may not adequately replace accountability, due to the loss of formal information. This is because the audit requirements for local government were significantly reduced, shrinking both the audit cost but also the level of scrutiny \(more detailed audit costs more\), and hence the information available to the taxpayer \(and others\) since 2010 on where money is being spent has also been significantly reduced \(R3, R4\). Ferry also identified that the reduction in performance information is constraining public reporting, scrutiny and public assurance \(R2, R3, R4, R6\), and the changing mix of accountability and transparency may involve VfM risks \(R3, R4\). Ultimately, he highlighted the dangers this has for actual and perceived fairness in society \(R2, R5\). Ferry therefore proposed a broader approach for public audit that covered financial stewardship, VfM and fairness to uphold accountability for the state and democracy \(R3, R4\). 

 Ferry’s successful fellowship application enabled his unique access to Parliamentary archives, as a Parliamentary Academic Fellow and then Adviser. He developed and presented a scoping report for the HoC HCLG on accountability in local government. The HoC HCLG then supported Ferry to produce his published Parliament Report \(R1\), combining findings from his previous research with an extensive documentation review of practitioner and academic literature and new work through Parliamentary enabled/supported access to ‘elite’ stakeholders during this period. Ferry conducted over 50 interviews of key players in the local government audit sphere; politicians, government and Parliamentary officials, the NAO, think tanks, accountancy firms and consultants. The published report covers savings from regulatory changes, fragmentation of bodies involved, auditor independence, audit scope, audit competition and sustainability of the market, inspection and intervention arrangements, and implications for accountability and democracy. The full report was published by the House of Commons Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee in July 2019.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Professor Ferry has undertaken a range of activities in recent years to ensure that his research findings reach policymakers, including extensive work with government and accounting / accountability organisations, informing policy debates around resilience, VfM and fairness in communities, regions and society. His appointment as a Parliamentary Academic Fellow, working with the House of Commons Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee from March 2018, was the culmination of his earlier activities, which include giving extensive written and oral evidence to the UK Parliament, and working closely with organisations such as the NAO, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\), the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy \(CIPFA\) and the Centre for Public Scrutiny \(CfPS\), where he disseminates, discusses, and advises on his research \(including R1\-R6\), feeding into their activities and practices \[E1, E4, E5, E9, E10\]. 

 Ferry’s written submissions to HoC HCLG enquiries have included those to: 1\) The “Brexit and Local Government” enquiry, which led to his giving oral evidence to the committee \[E9\] in December 2017, focussing on what this may mean for the role of local government and place\-based accountability especially given the increased commercialisation of local public services; and 2\) the “Government interventions: the use of Commissioners in Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets” enquiry. The latter’s report quotes Ferry’s submission, in which he refers to his research findings, that austerity\-localism causes problems in ensuring that local authorities provide value for money: “The framework is geared to prevent financial failure, which means financial pressure will more likely lead to service rather than financial impacts” \[E10\]. The HoC Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee's 2017 report on ""Accounting for democracy: making sure Parliament, the people and ministers know how and why public money is spent"" cites a written submission by Ferry and Dr Chow \(a former Durham colleague\), that “under accrual accounting the revenue and expenditure statement will include items previously hidden from view”. This feeds into one of the report's recommendations, that ""Accruals accounting has allowed Parliament and the public to gain a better understanding of how the Government uses its resources and manages its assets and liabilities. Accruals accounting is therefore a good basis for the further work"" \[E10\]. 

 The greatest impacts on policy of Ferry’s research, however, arise from his work as a Parliamentary Academic Fellow with the HoC HCLG from March 2018 to December 2019 \(the appointment was extended beyond the usual 12 months\) \[E7\], and his subsequent appointment in 2020 as an Adviser to the Committee. In both roles, Ferry worked with Select Committee MPs and officers in a research/advisory capacity concerning accountability and procedure arrangements. Ferry’s work with the Committee coincided with the need for scrutiny of the LAA Act 2014. As the HoC HCLG committee clerk \(until July 2019\) Ed Beale states: *“Laurence’s original work proposals \(sic\) was to conduct research on local government accountability, particularly in a post\-Brexit landscape. This was particularly attractive to the Committee… due to the fact the Committee was conducting an inquiry on the impact of Brexit on Local Government, and secondly because I knew the Committee would be required to conduct post\-legislative scrutiny of the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 at some point in 2020.”* Ferry’s scoping report led to the Committee, chaired by Clive Betts MP, requesting a full Parliamentary report \(R1\). As Ed Beale attests *: “Clive agreed with the proposal and approach and felt it would be a valuable contribution to inform the Committee’s future work”* \[E7\]. 

 Ferry produced a full report for Parliament \(R1\), “Audit and Inspection of Local Authorities in England: Five years after the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014”, underpinned by his research \(R2 – R6\), and extended via new research benefiting from his fellowship that supported HoC access to documents, and interviews with key stakeholders. The report’s executive summary was presented to, and approved by, the Chair and Clerk of the Select Committee. The full report was presented to the full HoC HCLG committee in July 2019 \[E7\] and formally published by the Committee, with the endorsement of the Committee Clerk that it was *“considered … outstanding and high quality”* \[E7\]. It is now available on the UK Parliament website. 

 The Select Committee chair, Clive Betts MP, formally sent Ferry’s published report to the Secretary of State *“to help inform the post\-legislative scrutiny evaluation of the Act”* \[E6\]. *“It is extremely unusual for the Committee to share with the Ministry any publication except its own reports”*, attests Betts, who also stated that once the Government published their evaluation of the Act, Ferry’s report would be *“the basis of the Committee’s consideration”* \(of the evaluation findings\) \[E8\]. 

 As a result of the work of Ferry and the select committee, drawing attention to the fact that a higher level of scrutiny of the LAA Act 2014 than legally required was necessary, the Secretary of State announced in July 2019 \[E3, E6\] that Sir Tony Redmond would carry out an independent review of the local authority audit framework and of the transparency of local authority financial reporting in England. Upon receiving Ferry’s report from the Committee, the Secretary of State commented that he was “ *confident it will help to inform Sir Tony’s findings”* and that he expected *“Sir Tony will want to meet separately with … Professor Ferry”* \[E6\]. This review is the first to be fully focused in recent years on public sector audit, after four recent reports focussing on issues in the private sector \(Brydon, Competition and Markets Authority, Kingman and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee\). Ferry was subsequently invited by Redmond to sit on the Review’s seven\-member Advisory Panel as the only academic expert, alongside high\-ranking members of Government departments and auditing organisations \[E1, E3\]. The Panel endorsed using the HCLG Select Committee \(Ferry’s\) report \[R1\] as *“it contains useful evidence which could be utilised by the Review”* \[E3\] and Ferry was also interviewed as part of the review. Redmond attested that Ferry’s *“knowledge and expertise have been invaluable”* and that his *“report \- Audit and Inspection of Local Authorities in England: Five years after the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014, will play a part in informing the final Report and recommendations”* \[E3\]. 

 Alongside the Redmond Review, 2020 saw the publication of the NAO’s latest Audit Code of Practice, for auditors of local authorities, health bodies, police and fire. Ferry’s findings led to changes to the Code, which now enables local auditors to feed information to the NAO, and around consideration of financial resilience and VfM matters; the NAO’s Director Aileen Murphie attested \(prior to the Code’s publication\) that *“a loss of available information for the public on value for money locally is well proven by your \[Ferry’s\] work and has been picked up by the NAO as an issue in the renewal of Code of Audit Practice”*, and that Ferry’s recent work led to *“much discussion and helped to move the revised Code towards a proposed narrative value for money conclusion … The new conclusion should be much more tailored to the issues of individual places, their financial resilience and be a great deal more informative.”* The Audit Guidance Notes, used by auditors to interpret the Code, have also been informed by Ferry’s work \[E4\]. 

 The Redmond Review report was published in September 2020, recommending significant changes to public audit \[E1\], including tackling many issues highlighted by Ferry in his Parliamentary report \[R1\]; *“I have been guided by the need to see more accountability and transparency in the local audit system and my proposed recommendations reflect these principles”* said Redmond \[E1\]. These include the recommendation that an Office of Local Audit Regulation is created to oversee, procure, manage and regulate the external audits of local authorities in England. The creation of such a body requires primary legislation, and such discussions of a law change will bring this issue into the wider Parliamentary consciousness. This new body would overcome the serious concerns highlighted by Ferry around fragmentation of the current bodies involved in the audit process, and auditor independence and sustainability of the market, around audit competition. The implications around audit scope concerning VfM arising in particular from Ferry’s report were also considered by Redmond; Redmond endorsed the changes to the latest NAO Audit Code of Practice from earlier in 2020 that Ferry’s research had also informed. In addition, inspection concerns relating to service and financial viability are recommended by Redmond to be shared between local auditors and inspectorates, further reflecting points highlighted by Ferry. Finally, a simplified statement of service information and costs is also recommended to be prepared by each local authority to assist comparison with what was promised and to enable a judgment on performance, addressing some of Ferry’s concerns around performance information. Overall, these recommendations to the government by Redmond strengthen public accountability for democracy in line with Ferry’s research. 

 Upon the publication of the Redmond report, the Secretary of State for Local Government, the Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP, stated that *he “will consider the findings and recommendations carefully”*; the press release also confirmed that the MHCLG would *“carefully consider the recommendations proposed, which will play an important strategic role in strengthening the overall framework for local accountability”* \[E1\]. On 17 December 2020, the UK Government’s MHCLG published their response to the Redmond Review. Of the 23 recommendations made by the review, the Ministry agreed to 14 of the recommendations, partly agreed to a further 2, and are considering the other 7 recommendations further, offering a full response to these in Spring 2021 \[E2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research on the usage of drones for detection of animal and habitat monitoring has led to successful collaborations with Governments \(e.g. Madagascar\) and Non\-Governmental organizations \(e.g. Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Orangutan Information Centre, WWF, Endangered Wildlife Trust, Borneo Nature Foundation\). These organizations have indicated that drones and the analytical methods we have developed are facilitating their conservation efforts through more cost\-effective animal surveys, being able to obtain higher\-resolution data of land\-cover that allows for classification of vegetation types and changes over time, and being more efficient in detecting and extinguishing peat fires. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Ecosystem services \(carbon sequestration, pollination, flood buffering, and so forth\) are estimated to have a value of 125 trillion USD per year. This value is being eroded at a rate of 4\-5 trillion USD per year through the negative impact of human activities on these ecosystem services. An important component aspect of ecosystem services is biodiversity. Conservation efforts are attempting to counter biodiversity loss rely on accurate data on animal abundance, data on land cover and change therein, methods to reduce poaching, and methods to reduce other threats such as fires. 

 Since 2011 I have been using drones as a data collection platform to replace or complement existing methodologies as these can be inefficient in terms of time, too costly, or do not provide the data that are needed to support conservation efforts. The drone research described here \(UR 1\-6\) has been conducted since 2014 and was funded with a total of £1.42M from various funding bodies. The focus of the research was to assess the usefulness of drones to obtain data on animal distribution and density, land\-cover, and threats \(poaching and fires\). 

 UR 1 showed that drones equipped with standard visual spectrum cameras can be used to detect and count orangutan nests. These data can then subsequently be used to determine orangutan distribution and relative abundance. The aerial drone counts correlated with orangutan nest counts conducted with standard line transects on the ground indicating that counting orangutan nests with drones can be an alternative for ground counts. Because visual spectrum sensors do not allow for detecting animals at night and because they only allow for a small part of the spectrum to be sampled which hampers animal detection of animals that do not stand out from the background in the visual spectrum Prof. Longmore \(an astrophysicist\) and I started a collaboration to explore the potential of using thermal sensors to detect animals and automate this process \(UR2\). This seed funding led to two STFC and one EPSRC grants to explore this further. One of the studies conducted was on spider monkeys in Mexico in which we successfully showed that counting spider monkeys with thermal sensors is possible and is comparable and overall more accurate than humans counting the spider monkeys from the ground \(UR3\). We used similar methods to conduct a study in Tanzania during which we flew a drone equipped with a thermal and visual spectrum camera over people and showed that poachers could be detected with a higher probability on images obtained with the thermal sensor than those obtained with a standard visual spectrum camera \(UR4\). Another major threat to biodiversity is fires. In Indonesia these occur regularly at a large scale. We conducted an experimental study to determine whether drones with visual spectrum and thermal cameras could be used to detect above and below ground peat fires \(UR5\). In that study we showed the feasibility of such detection which led to another STFC grant. The combination of both STFC grants led to an EPSRC grant in which we combine research on animals, poachers, and fires, as well as land cover mapping \(UR6\). Because land cover change has a large influence on biodiversity and satellite images have limited resolution we also studies whether we can improve upon the classification of land cover types by satellites using drones and whether the images from drones can be classified into land cover types relevant for orangutans \(e.g. UR6\). In UR 6 we show that using images acquired by a drone equipped with a visual spectrum camera can be used as training data for algorithms that used satellite images for land\-cover classification and increase the accuracy of these land\-cover classifications as well as the number of land\-cover classes. In addition, we have been using drones with visual spectrum cameras as a mapping tool with the data being processed into land cover types using several machine learning algorithms.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In UR 1 we showed that drones can be used to count orangutan nests and determine orangutan distribution and relative density using standard visual spectrum cameras. The aerial counts can therefore be an alternative to ground counts of orangutan nests and reduce the time to collect data by at least a factor two. 

 This led a number of Non\-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\) in Indonesia \(from 2016 onwards\) to count orangutan nests for surveys on orangutan distribution and density in the areas that they work \(Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Program \[S1\], Orangutan Information Centre \[S2\]\) and an NGO in Tanzania \(Greater Malale Ecosystem Research and Conservation\) to use drones to count chimpanzee nests \[S3\]. 

 <ins>Mr.</ins> <ins>Hadisiswoyo</ins>, Founder of the Orangutan Information Centre: “In terms of orangutan survey work I estimate that the drone usage has cut the time needed for surveys and analyses in half which is a huge time and cost saving.” \[S2\]. 

 This research has also influenced research centres and NGOs \(such as WWF\) to start using drones for monitoring of animal species. 

 <ins>Dr.</ins> <ins>Goossens</ins>, Danau Girang Field Centre lead researcher: “Drones are a key emerging technology that we are keeping a keen eye on and the research by Prof. Serge Wich has influenced our thinking about usage of drones for our conservation efforts. Serge has visited our site several years ago to demonstrate the usage of drones and provide advice on their usage for conservation projects.” \[S4\]. 

 <ins>Dr.</ins> <ins>van der</ins> <ins>Hoeven</ins>, WWF Netherlands: “The conservation research using drones that has been conducted by Prof. Serge Wich has been very influential on getting us started with drones for various of our projects. As a result of his papers and further discussions with him we are ow using drones in several of our conservation projects and are planning to extend this. Drones have in several cases facilitated our conservation efforts….” \[S5\]. 

 The studies that used drones equipped with a thermal infrared sensor to detect and classify animals and poachers through manual and automated methods \(funded by STFC for £411,988\) with a thermal sensor \(UR 2 and 4\) led to a number of collaborations with conservation NGOs \(GMERC, WWF UK/Sabah, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Endangered Wildlife Trust, ConMonoMaya\), universities \(e.g. University of Vera Cruz\),\). During those collaborations drones with thermal cameras were used to successfully detect species such as orangutans, spider monkeys, poachers and riverine rabbits. 

 Our collaboration with GMERC in Tanzania has shown that through using drones with a thermal camera and machine learning we can detect poachers 17x faster in images than through a manual method. 

 <ins>Dr</ins> <ins>Piel</ins>, Lead researcher of the Greater Mahale Ecosystem Research and Conservation Project: “… drones coupled with machine learning can detect poachers 17x faster than when images are examined manually.” \[S3\]. 

 One of these collaborations led to a paper itself \(UR 3\) that indicated that drone surveys result in better counts of large spider monkey sub\-groups and faster surveys \(S5\). As a result drones are now being used to count spider monkeys in Mexico. 

 <ins>Dr</ins> <ins>Spaan</ins>, Population Monitoring Coordinator of the Mexican Conservation NGO ‘ConMonoMaya’: “…  the drone allows for much faster coverage of an area than the \[traditional\] ground method does.” \[S6\] 

 The work drones and machine learning with EWT in South Africa has led to 10\-15x faster sorting of images than through manual methods which saves time and money. 

 <ins>Dr Theron</ins>, Head of Drylands Conservation Program at the Endangered Wildlife Trust: “The research with drones and camera traps coupled with machine learning has shown that we can now detect Riverine Rabbits much faster in images than through our default method which would require human analysts going through tens of thousands of images. We have seen by way of example that manually sorting images will take 10 to 15 times the amount of time required to simply upload the images to the machine learning pipeline. This represents a significant amount of skilled resources that can be redirected to more productive conservation activities. The direct cost saving amounts to approximately £ 1500 per large camera trap survey \(80 or more cameras\) or more than 20 working days in one team members time.” \[S7\]. 

 This drone work has also led WWF to implement drones in various of their conservation programs in Malaysia, Nepal, and Brazil \[S5 & S8\]. 

 The fire detection study that was funded by GCRF and led to UR5 indicated that peat fires above and below ground could be detected with thermal sensors. On the basis of this started a collaboration with the Borneo Nature Foundation and the University of Palangkaraya to use drones for fire detection and monitoring and directly have impact. In 2019 the LJMU team went to Borneo to test the drone equipment during the 2019 fire season and train the local counterparts on the usage of the equipment. This has led to drones with thermal and visual spectrum sensors being used by the Borneo Nature Foundation to increase the efficiency of the fire fighting teams during the fires of 2019 \[S9\]. 

 In his letter, <ins>Bernat</ins> <ins>Capilla</ins>, Director of Programs at BNF, states, “… the overwhelmingly positive feedback from fire\-fighting teams and their desire for thermal drones to attend all possible fire events, attests to this positive impact. This derives from an increased ability and speed of  detecting fires \(compared to checking on foot, which is dangerous and may take many hours for a large fire, we estimate that use of a thermal drone allows fire hotspot location mapping to be completed around at least 10x quicker and with almost no safety risk\), which in turn improves the ability of teams to monitor the current fire situation and deploy team members as necessary to prevent fire spread and extinguish hotspots. … The technology is also particularly useful in surveying fire sites post\-initial fire\-fighting, to confirm that all hotspots are extinguished and it is safe to leave the site, again increasing the speed of this by at least 10x. This is vitally important, as peat fires can smoulder beneath the surface, where they are difficult to detect without the aid of thermal imaging technology, and then re\-emerge after fire\-fighters have gone home, causing more damage.” This can be further summarized in two impacts. 1\) Increased efficiency in finding/extinguishing fires: The fire\-fighters estimate that compared to traditional methods, our drone system accurately identifies the location of the fires over 10x quicker, helps extinguish them 50% quicker and makes it over 10x quicker to confirm fires are extinguished. 2\) Improved health of firefighters and surrounding population: the increased efficiency in finding/extinguishing the fires led to \(i\) virtually zero exposure to the previous safety risks finding fires; \(ii\) 200 days less smoke inhalation for the fire fighters, the effects of which are known to be extremely harmful; \(iii\) a corresponding drop in the concentration of toxic haze which had to be endured by the \~15 million Kalimantan province residents. In 2020 we intended to bring additional drone systems with new automated fire\-detection capability to additional fire teams in Indonesia. We believe this would have significantly increased the above impacts. However, COVID\-19 travel restrictions meant it was not possible to deliver the systems. 

 The research conducted in UR2\-5 led to a grant from UKRI to directly impact conservation and economic growth in Madagascar in which LJMU, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, and Government of Madagascar are collaborating to use drones to protect biodiversity but also to stimulate economic growth through drone technology in other sectors of the economy in Madagascar. An initial survey in Madagascar has indicated that Bandro lemurs can be detected 100x faster with drones equipped with a thermal imaging camera compared to the traditional surveys by canoe and saves in operating costs \[S10\]. <ins>Dr Hudson</ins>, Head of Research, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust: “… the team then flew the system over key areas of marsh that have been inaccessible to previous surveys. In 3 x 20\-minute flights, the drone system reproduced lemur densities estimated from previous surveys requiring 24 person\-weeks of effort. Scaling\-up this programme to cover the entire lake represents an approximately 100 times increase in survey efficiency. … The adoption of this research technology will revolutionise the scale and frequency with which DWCT and our partners in Madagascar, including the Madagascar National Parks Service, can conduct surveys.” 

 <ins>Dr Hudson</ins>: our drone system represents “…a saving of £8,000, annually. In the field of conservation where funding for ‘routine’ actions such as monitoring is hard won, this saving is a fantastic achievement and will help to guarantee the sustainability of our field programmes, long\-term.” \[CS3\] 

 The research on habitat mapping in UR 6 has also allowed for much faster mapping of orangutan habitat. 

 <ins>Mr.</ins> <ins>Hadisiswoyo</ins>, Founder of the Orangutan Information Centre: “The drones have also allowed us to do habitat mapping much faster than if we were to do this on foot. I estimate that data collection is approximately 9 times faster and yields data that we would not be able to collect from the ground.” \[S2\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Invasive pneumococcal diseases, including meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia, are a major cause of death in young children in resource poor countries, and cause serious illness in developed countries. In 2015, invasive pneumococcus disease was responsible for nearly 300,000 paediatric deaths globally, but pneumococcal vaccine programmes have improved health outcomes for children worldwide. Research on pneumococcal vaccination by University of Oxford, Oxford Vaccine Group \(OVG\) shaped the World Health Organisation’s recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination schedules for infants and was adopted by several low and middle income countries, and directly changed national immunisation policies in the UK and Nepal. The improved UK pneumococcal immunisation strategy has both reduced the number of injections given to infants and provided estimated savings to the NHS of GBP27,500,000 annually. The immunisation strategy in Nepal has led to a 34% reduction in bacterial pneumonia in infants, and averted catastrophic expenditures for thousands of the poorest families. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Pneumococcal infections, caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* bacteria, can cause serious invasive diseases including meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines \(PCVs\) reduce pneumococcal disease burden by direct protection and by reducing nasopharyngeal carriage, thereby preventing transmission and inducing herd protection. There are many pneumococcal serotypes and vaccines have been developed against the serotypes most likely to cause serious disease.  In 2010, the original pneumococcal glycoconjugate vaccine, PCV7 \(7\-valent, Pfizer\), was replaced by PCV13 \(13\-valent, Pfizer\) and PCV10 \(10\-valent, GSK\) to provide protection against additional pneumococcal serotypes not covered by PCV7. 

 The greatest proportion of pneumococcal disease occurs in late infancy and in toddlers. Therefore, an ideal vaccine programme would protect children from disease throughout early childhood. Over the last two decades, the Oxford Vaccine Group \(OVG\) at the University of Oxford has led over 20 clinical research studies addressing the prevention of pneumococcal disease through vaccination. 

####  Disease surveillance and clinical trials in low and middle income countries 

 Since 2005, the OVG has led a pneumococcal disease surveillance project at Patan Hospital, Nepal. In 2010, the team demonstrated that pneumococcus was the most common cause of meningitis, pneumonia and infant septicaemia at this hospital \[1\], suggesting that vaccination against pneumococcus could significantly improve the health of children in Nepal. The OVG designed and implemented a phase 4 clinical trial of the PCV10 vaccine in infants in Nepal, starting in 2010 \[2\]. They compared two immunisation schedules: 2 priming doses \(at 6 weeks and 14 weeks old\) plus 1 booster dose \(at 9 months old\), known as a 2\+1 schedule; and a 3\+0 schedule, comprising three priming doses at 6, 10 and 14 weeks old. At that time, the 3\+0 schedule was included in the WHO Expanded Programme of Immunisation schedule and used in most low and middle income countries \(LMICs\). OVG found that the 2\+1 schedule resulted in improved antibody persistence through early childhood compared with the 3\+0 schedule \[2\], providing protection to children throughout the peak risk period of disease transmission. Administering a booster dose at 9 months also provides the opportunity for this to be given the same time as measles immunisation, which may provide logistical and economic advantages in certain settings. 

 Subsequently, starting in 2015, the OVG implemented a further phase 4 clinical trial of PCV10 in Nepal to compare the 2\+1 schedule with immunisations at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and 9 months with an ‘accelerated’ 2\+1 schedule with immunisations at 6 weeks, 10 weeks and 9 months \[3\]. The rationale for this trial was that 2 other immunisations are recommended at 14 weeks of age for infants in Nepal \(pentavalent vaccine and inactivated poliomyelitis virus vaccine\), and there were concerns about public acceptance of 3 immunisations being administered at 14 weeks. The trial showed comparable immune responses for both 2\+1 schedules, validating use of an accelerated prime\-boost schedule where logistically necessary \[3\]. 

 The OVG team also initiated pharyngeal swabbing studies in Nepal. Firstly, in 2012 they enrolled 600 children to determine the local prevalence of circulating pneumococcal serotypes prior to introduction of PCV10 into the national immunisation schedule \[4\]. Their ongoing studies have enrolled nearly 4000 children, enabling continued surveillance of circulating pneumococcal serotypes since the introduction of PCV10. 

####  Pneumococcal vaccine design and UK clinical trials 

 Starting in 2006, the OVG led a phase 4 randomised clinical trial in the UK of the novel PCV13 pneumococcal vaccine to assess immunogenicity and tolerability in a 2\+1 schedule, given at 2, 4 and 12 months of age \[5\]. Their results, published in 2010, demonstrated near\-universal immune response to all serotypes in PCV13, without impacting on concomitantly administered vaccines \[5\], providing support to the UK Department of Health and Social Care decision in 2010 to replace PCV7 with PCV13 in the national immunisation schedule. 

 With the introduction of meningococcal B vaccine into the UK infant immunisation schedule in 2015, there was a need to reduce the number of vaccine doses delivered without compromising disease control. In 2016, the OVG collaborated with University College London and Public Health England to lead a phase 4 randomised clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a reduced dosing strategy for PCV13: a 1\+1 schedule, with immunisations at 3 and 12 months of age \[6\]. Their study demonstrated an at least equivalent immune response for 9 out of 13 serotypes for this 1\+1 schedule compared with the 2\+1 \(2, 4 and 12 month\) schedule \[6\]. This study was the first in the world to assess a 1\+1 schedule for pneumococcal vaccines.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As the major cause of bacterial meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia, *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is responsible for approximately 3,700,000 cases of severe disease and 500,000 deaths globally each year in young children. The schedule of immunisations is essential for effective and sustainable vaccination programmes, as the exact number and timing of doses influences efficacy, public acceptance, costs, and long\-term sustainability. 

####  Changing global and UK healthcare policy 

 **World Health Organisation, and low and middle income countries:** In Nepal, in Nov 2013 the National Committee on Immunisation Practices \(NCIP\) recommended the introduction of the PCV10 pneumococcal vaccine into the national immunisation schedule for infants \[A\], based on the OVG’s research \[1, 2, 4\]. Specifically, a 2\+1 dosing schedule was chosen instead of 3\+0, based on the OVG trial data \[2\]. Based on the NCIP recommendation, from 2015, PCV10 was implemented in the Nepalese infant immunisation schedule, available to more than 500,000 infants per year. Further, the OVG’s research \[3\] validated the choice in Nepal to use an ‘accelerated’ 2\+1 dosing schedule, which was more acceptable to the public and the research showed was as effective as the standard 2\+1 schedule. 

 The OVG research demonstrating benefits of using a 2\+1 versus a 3\+0 dosing schedule in Nepal \[2\] was extensively referenced in a 2017 systematic review of the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which was prepared for the WHO Special Advisory Group of Experts \(SAGE\) for immunisation \[B\]. In Feb 2019, the WHO recommended a 2\+1 schedule for infant immunisation against pneumococcal disease \[C\], informed by this systematic review and the OVG research \[2, 3\] \[D\]. Based on these WHO recommendations, as of Nov 2020, 2\+1 schedules for PCVs had been adopted for routine infant immunisations by 7 LMICs receiving support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations \(GAVI\), in addition to Nepal: India, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and the Republic of Moldova \[E\]. This implementation of the 2\+1 immunisation schedule applies to approximately 30,700,000 infants each year across these 8 countries. Notably, India had the world’s highest number of pneumococcal deaths in 2015 and introduced routine immunisation following the 2\+1 schedule in 2017 \[E\], prioritising states with the highest pneumonia burden. 

 **UK vaccination schedules:** In October 2017, the UK Joint Committee for Vaccines and Immunisation \(JCVI\) reviewed data from the OVG\-led trial comparing a 2\+1 to a 1\+1 schedule for PCV13 \[6\] and, based on this research, made a recommendation to the UK Department of Health and Social Care that the UK infant immunisation schedule should be changed from the 2\+1 schedule \(immunisations at 2, 4 and 12 months\) to a 1\+1 schedule \(immunisations at 3 and 12 months\) \[Fi\]. Public Health England announced in April 2019 that the new 1\+1 schedule should be offered to all infants born on or after 1 Jan 2020 \[Fii\]. This was the first implementation of a 1\+1 PCV13 schedule in the world.  This trial and change in the UK policy is a landmark that provided credibility and reassurance to other countries that reduced dosing is safe and has cost benefits, instigating further studies in India, Vietnam, South Africa and the Gambia, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to see if this reduced dose schedule is similarly immunogenic in LMICs \[Gi\]. Indeed, results from the study in South Africa \(referencing \[6\]\), confirmed that the 1\+1 schedule was not inferior to 2\+1 in a LMIC with an established PCV immunisation programme, providing the opportunity to reduce the cost of PCV procurement \[Gii\]. 

####  Improving health outcomes for children 

 **Decreased invasive pneumococcal disease and fewer injections for infants in the UK:** The switch from PCV7 to PCV13 in the UK vaccination schedule in 2010, which was influenced by OVG research \[5\] showing that PCV13 was highly immunogenic and well tolerated in the UK schedule \[H\], resulting in large decreases in cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, including since August 2013. Specifically, a PHE study showed that in 2013/14 the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales had decreased by 32% compared to the level before the introduction of PCV13 immunisations; this resulted in at least 1,800 fewer cases of these serious, life\-threatening infections in 2013/14 \[Ii\]. A further PHE study showed that, in 2016/17, invasive pneumococcal disease cases resulting from PV13\-type serotypes had decreased by 64% since the introduction of PCV13 \[Iii\]. Overall, PHE data from England and Wales, shows that pneumococcal vaccination has prevented an estimated 9,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under 5 between 2013\-2017 \[Iii,iii\]. 

 Implementation of the 1\+1 immunisation schedule in the UK resulted in approximately 750,000 fewer doses of pneumococcal vaccine being administered annually. Fewer injections means less distress and discomfort for infants and their parents. Mathematical modelling by PHE, based on the immunogenicity data from the trial led by the OVG \[6\], indicated that this reduction in discomfort through reducing the number of injections will not cause any significant loss of control of pneumococcal disease, with an estimate of only 2 additional cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under 2 years, over 5 a year period \[J\]. 

 **Global decreases in pneumococcal deaths, severe disease and economic impacts:** The global mortality rate for pneumococcus in 2015 was estimated to be 45 deaths \(uncertainty range 29–56\) per 100,000 children under the age of 5, with uncertainty in part due to the pathogen not being identified in many cases of pneumonia \[K\]. Overall, pneumococcal vaccine programs, including those based on OVG research, have resulted in a mean annual reduction of global paediatric deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease of 47,400 between 2010 and 2015, and an estimation that this reduction will have been at least equalled for every year since 2013 \[K\]. As of November 2020, 138 countries, including 58 LMICs, had introduced a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into their national immunisation schedule \[E\], and a minimal estimate is that 22,800,000 children across the world have been immunised against pneumococcal infections \[E\]. Nepal is an illustrative example of the impact, where the vaccine programme was heavily influenced by the OVG research: in 2018 there was a 34% reduction in cases \(at least 15,500 fewer cases per year\) of bacterial pneumonia in children compared to the pre\-vaccination period \(2014\-2015\)\[Li\]; and by 2019, carriage of vaccine\-serotype pneumococcus had decreased by 74% among healthy infants \[Li\]. Pneumococcal disease has a major economic impact on poor families, through costs of healthcare and loss of earnings; for example, in Nepal, out\-of\-pocket payments for pneumonia hospitalizations exceeded 40% of the monthly household spending for more than 70% of households in the three poorest quintiles \[Lii\]. Analysis of the impact of introduction of the PCV10 vaccination in Nepal estimated that vaccination averted 85% of catastrophic health expenditures among the poorest quintiles of the population \[Liii\]. 

####  Financial benefits to the NHS 

 The reduction in doses of PCV13 administered in the UK, through introduction of the 1\+1 schedule from 1 Jan – 31 Dec 2020, has resulted savings to the NHS of GBP7,500,000 in vaccine administration costs alone, with additional savings through reduced vaccine purchasing costs. The ‘shelf price’ of this vaccine is GBP49 per dose and, although NHS purchase price is not publicly available, the total annual savings to the NHS for 2020 are estimated as at least GBP20,000,000.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Non\-transparent public finances threaten the sustainability of public services. Heald’s research and engagement have influenced parliamentary debate and effected changes to policy and practice in the Scottish and Welsh Governments and Parliaments, the UK Parliament and Treasury, and internationally through the IMF and the OECD. His contributions have improved fiscal transparency through reforms to public sector accounting and international harmonisation and have provided evidence for policy actors seeking to reduce potential harm by contesting techniques that hide government obligations and damage public trust. His research has also formed the basis for impact on contemporary issues such as fiscal devolution, Brexit and the fiscal response to COVID. As a result of his work, Parliaments, citizens and civic society have access to improved financial information on the performance of the fiscal state. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

###   

 Public sector accounting has acquired enhanced macroeconomic significance since the global financial crisis of the late 2000s. Following successful implementation of accruals accounting \(and sometimes budgeting\) in vanguard countries such as the UK, attention has shifted to securing improved financial management of the public domain and to addressing weaknesses in public accountability through enhancement of fiscal transparency. Heald identified gaps in the evidence base as the foundation for a programme of research which was designed to ensure that the extensive reforms to government accounting in the 1990s and early 2000s would bring enhanced fiscal transparency and more accountable and trustworthy government in the UK and elsewhere. 

 <ins>Heald conceptualised fiscal transparency and assessed practice by UK and overseas governments by identifying and analysing four modes of government accounting \(financial reporting, statistical accounting, budgeting and fiscal sustainability projections\) within the Miller\-Power economisation framework \(territorialising, mediating, adjudicating and subjectivising\). The analysis included the enhancement of fiscal transparency and therefore the legitimacy of public finances by emphasising:</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>i</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>assets and liabilities as well as revenue and expenditure;</ins> <ins>\(ii\)</ins> <ins>the realisation of the benefits of technical accounting change</ins> <ins>for</ins> <ins>the policy\-making</ins> <ins>and scrutiny functions of national and devolved parliaments;</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>\(iii\)</ins> <ins>the clarification of realistic goals for public audit institutions</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>which allow them to realise the benefits of insider access yet maintain their operational autonomy from both the Executive and Legislature.</ins> 

 **The principal findings and insights from this research**:

###  4. Details of the impact 

###   

 Lack of transparency erodes legitimacy, encourages waste and corruption, and threatens the services available to citizens. Heald’s research on transparency has been, *“important in raising the profile of fiscal transparency and improved public sector financial reporting among policy\-makers, practitioners and civil society groups… \[and contributed\] to managing risks to fiscal sustainability and public services, and… to the development and dissemination of good practice.”* \(statement from the Auditor General for Scotland, 2012\-20 **\[5A\]**\). 

 From 2015\-20, Heald has continued his career\-long strategy of contributing to the international and domestic public financial management community, providing not only relevant research but also findings translated into formats that meet the needs of international organisations, national and devolved governments, UK and devolved parliaments, and public audit institutions. The Auditor General for Scotland wrote, *“I have seen the impact of his \[Heald’s\] work internationally through organisations such as the IMF and the OECD, and directly in Scotland as the Scottish Parliament has taken on major new fiscal powers over the last five years.”* **\[5A\]**. 

 **4.1. At international level** 

 Heald’s research **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]** has underpinned briefings on fiscal transparency to international policy actors including the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department, the OECD, the South Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the World Bank Governance Division \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5B\]**\). 

 In response to a request from the then UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, an IMF technical assistance mission carried out a Fiscal Transparency Evaluation of the UK in 2016. The team was familiar with Heald’s research and met him as part of their fieldwork \(confirmed by statement from the former head of the IMF Public Financial Management Division **\[5C\]**\). The resultant IMF report, *“concurred with Heald’s commendation of the technical achievements of the UK Treasury”*, but also \(a\) *“his identification of the severe fiscal risks from PPPs \[Public\-Private Partnerships\] and other off\-balance sheet techniques such as government guarantees”* and \(b\) *“his criticisms of the lack of timeliness of Estimates”*. As a result of the report, better documentation is now provided on fiscal risk, but progress on timeliness is less likely because the UK Government asserted its prerogatives over Parliament during the conflict over Brexit \(confirmed by official reports **\[5D\]**\). 

 While proponents argue that PPPs offer a more efficient use of public funds and more streamlined processes than publicly funded vehicles, current public sector accounting rules and public finance statistics allow PPPs to be used to hide public debt and often suffer from a lack of transparency and limited public scrutiny. Heald’s research has been reported in the *Economist*, and by the BBC **\[5L\]**. His contributions to the OECD’s Senior Budget Officials Network \(2016\-2020\) in *“the areas of PPPs and government guarantees, particularly in relation to neutrality in project appraisal and financial reporting…have strongly influenced International Transport Forum/OECD positions”* \(statement from the ITF/OECD Procurement and Private Investment in Infrastructure Lead **\[5E\]**\). 

 Heald’s transparency research has also impacted on the development of harmonised public sector accounting and greater alignment between government financial reporting and statistical accounting \(i.e. national accounts\). He contributed to the Eurostat project to develop European Public Sector Accounting Standards \(EPSAS\), and presented his research findings at the European Court of Auditors **\[5F\]**. The EPSAS Project Lead confirmed, *“\[Heald\] reminded us through his research that improving fiscal transparency is a continuous process that must be nurtured and protected \[and\] made an important contribution to the work of statisticians, through the clear linkage in his work between statistical accounting and public financial management.”* \(statement from the Head of the EPSAS Project **,** Eurostat **\[5F\]**\). 

 **4.2. At UK level** 

 Heald also translated his transparency research into a wide range of briefings for UK policy actors on fiscal transparency, including Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, National Infrastructure Commission and the Study of Parliament Group \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5B\]**\). 

 Heald demonstrated to the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee of the House of Commons that the UK’s impressive accounting reforms, regarded as among the most sophisticated in the world, have not been matched by transparency advances in accessibility and use. He was extensively cited in the Committee’s report on *Accounting for democracy: making sure Parliament, the people and ministers know how and why public money is spent* \(April 2017\) \(confirmed by official report **\[5A\]**\). Following a Treasury review of enhancements to the clarity and usefulness of financial reporting, Heald was appointed by the Treasury to its newly\-established User Preparer Advisory Group **\[5D\]**, where at the first meeting on 23 January 2020 he secured agreement that associated documents and minutes would become publicly available after the subsequent meeting, thus enhancing transparency. 

 To improve quality and scrutiny in the UK, Heald argued for a Spending and Tax Committee that would look explicitly and continuously at the relationship between expenditure and revenue. He highlighted problems with the current *ex ante* system, which is Executive\-dominated and legislated four months into the financial year. Heald’s research\-based proposals **\[3.1\]** were extensively cited in the Procedure Committee’s 2017 report on Supply and taken forward in the 2017\-19 Parliament through its Budget Committee inquiry, to which Heald provided further written and oral evidence cited in the basis for conclusions. They *“clearly helped to shape the Procedure Committee’s subsequent proposals for a Budget Committee and the Committee’s understanding of the need for separation between the functions of the new Committee and the audit\-related roles of the National Audit Office and Committee of Public Accounts… Professor Heald’s involvement and advice has helped the Committee to frame recommendations which reflect an understanding of the concerns and priorities of the Treasury and the National Audit Office and which are thus likely to have an enduring impact on how Parliament undertakes its financial scrutiny role in the future.”* \(statement from the Managing Director, Select Committees Team, House of Commons **\[5D\]**\). 

 Using his research **\[3.6\]**, Heald contributed to the parliamentary analysis of the UK fiscal response to the COVID\-19 pandemic, submitting written evidence \(August 2020\) to the Treasury Committee’s Inquiry into Taxation after Coronavirus **\[5D\]**. 

 **4.3. At the level of devolved government within the UK** 

 Heald’s impact has been to increase the transparency and accountability of Scottish public finances, including support for government statisticians’ improvements in data quality \(confirmed by statement **\[5G\]** from the Regulatory Services Office for Statistics Regulation, UK Statistics Authority\). Heald gave research\-based oral evidence in sessions with Scottish Parliament Committees and in a private meeting with the Budget Process Review Group, commissioned by the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government to review the budgetary process and reinforce the principles of transparency and accountability \(confirmed by official reports **\[5H\]**\). *“His work on the theorisation of public audit has helped Audit Scotland and other public audit agencies to clarify their purpose, recognising public trust as an important side effect of effective public audit, achieved through increasing fiscal transparency rather than as an end in itself.”* \(statement from the Auditor General for Scotland, 2012\-20 **\[5A\]**\). 

  

 The Fiscal Framework agreement between the Scottish and UK Governments determines how Scotland is funded and underpins the powers set out in the *Scotland Act 2016*. Heald advised on the choice of the block grant adjustment mechanism within the 2016 Scottish Fiscal Framework after tax devolution was extended **,** and is now contributing to Scottish preparations for the 2021 renegotiation with the aim of enhancing the accountability of Scotland’s public finances \(confirmed in a statement from the Chief Economic Adviser to the Scottish Government **\[5I\]**\). 

 The impact of his research on the 10\-year journey to Welsh fiscal devolution has been acknowledged by Mark Drakeford AM, then Cabinet Secretary for Finance, and Simon Thomas AM, then Chair of the National Assembly for Wales Finance Committee, who described Heald as, *“one of the people who played a part in helping successive Welsh Governments and National Assemblies on this fiscal devolution journey.”* **\[5J\]**. 

  

 Heald’s research **\[3.5\]** was extensively cited by the UK Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee in its 2019 report **\[5J\]** criticising the operation of the funding arrangements for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, continuing the pressure for greater transparency to which the Treasury has slowly responded. 

  

 Heald’s research **\[3.4\]** has also impacted on the policy analysis of how Brexit will affect Scottish public finances and public services. His ESRC\-funded series of seminars was attended by government officials, business leaders and EU diplomats as well as academics **\[5K\]**. He submitted evidence to the Scottish Parliament’s Finance and Constitution Committee on 27 September 2017 regarding the impact of Brexit on the Scottish budget, and was involved in the planning by Audit Scotland on the direct implications of Brexit for Scottish public finances and public services \(2018\) \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5K\]**\). 

 Recently Heald chaired a committee of the Royal Society of Edinburgh \(RSE\) which in October 2020 submitted an Advice Paper **\[5J\]** to the Scottish Government consultation on the COVID\-affected Scottish Budget 2021\-22, then represented the RSE in the stakeholder consultation on 5 November 2020 chaired by Kate Forbes MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Finance **\[5J\]**. 

 Thus, through a deliberate cyclical engagement strategy of research stimulated by <ins>policy and practice,</ins> Heald’s work has impacted on the protection and promotion of fiscal transparency in the Scottish Government and Parliament, the UK Parliament and Treasury, and internationally through the OECD and IMF.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Wright’s practice\-based research applies club culture technology to improvised music, the contemporary concert hall, and multimedia theatre, connecting composition, performance and studio recording. *This allows new ways of performing and composing which have resulted in the co\-creation of new music and sound design, influenced creative practice and contributed to cultural programming and the creative economy **. His work impacts on the cultural sector to the benefit of audiences for new music, jazz, and improvisation, the theatre going public, creative organisations and professional musicians. Impact has been realised through work with leading saxophonist Evan Parker, Dutch contemporary music group Ensemble Klang, and Belgian ensembles B’rock and Bl\!ndman Hybrid \(including Grammy\-nominated soprano Claron McFadden\). In 2017/18, Wright was Musical Director, and contributed to the sound design, for the National Theatre’s \(NT\) production of *Network*, for which composer Eric Sleichim received an Olivier Award nomination. The UK run of 75 shows were sold out, with an estimated audience of 67,000, contributing to the highest annual box office ever achieved for NT productions at the Southbank. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Wright works internationally as a composer, improviser and sound designer with his research applying technologies and performance practices usually associated with DJ/club culture to reinvent a range of interdisciplinary practices, located within three distinct areas: Improvised music, contemporary concert music, and multimedia theatre. 

 **Improvised Music.** Wright’s collaboration with saxophonist Evan Parker for *Trance Map* **\[3.1\]** demonstrates that with new digital tools, archival recordings can themselves become materials for the live performance and \(post\) production of free improvisation. Ableton live software, originally developed for use in a club setting by DJs, is utilised by Wright to record, transform and playback music, creating 'navigable archives' of sounds which can be accessed, remixed and used to create new compositions in real time, blending the live and the recorded. Since 2014, this research has been developed via *Trance Map \+* **\[3.2\]** with international collaborators such as Peter Evans, Mark Nauseef, and Ned Rothenberg, encapsulated in the quintet recording *Crepuscule in Nickelsdorf* \(2019\). This mixing of ‘live’ and ‘recorded’ musicians *reassesses the role that digital technology can play in improvised music, addressing questions of agency and authorship in live performance.* The sampling and live remixing developed within the *Trance Map\+* became a key component in two of Parker’s ElectroAcoustic Ensemble commissions for Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, *Twelve for Twelve Musicians* \(2014\) and *Improvisation* \(2019\). 

 **Contemporary concert music.** For *Totem for Den Haag* \(returned REF 2014\) **\[3.3\],** Wright worked with Ensemble Klang using a video of turntable rotation as a guide for polyrhythmic performance, enabling the ensemble to efficiently learn, through simple notation, complex rhythmic information which is then reworked for each performance by Wright’s live remixing techniques. In 2015, this piece was expanded into a new version for leading Mexican ensemble CEPROMusic, to be performed in Mexico City \(as part of UKMX\). These techniques were further explored in *Fast Gold Butterflies* **\[3.4\],** a composition where Wright asked Ensemble Klang \(a group usually performing with saxophones, guitars, keyboards and percussion\) to replace their traditional instruments with keyboards controlling Ableton Live software, *therefore changing the role of the performer allowing the ensemble to remix their performance live onstage and project this in surround sound around the audience, bringing a new, previously unexplored soundworld to the group*. Wright composed the piece, designed the Ableton Live patch and mixed the sound live during a performance at Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival in 2018. *Corelli\_HACK* **\[3.5\]**, commissioned by the TRANSIT festival and composed by Wright for the combination of the B’Rock early music ensemble and electronics, investigates the radical fragmentation and re\-assemblage of Corelli’s Concerto Grosso Opus 6, No. 4. It saw B’rock work with surround sound electronics for the first time, which *expanded the spatial reach and ensemble balance* of the traditional baroque ensemble. Wright's work *re\-imagined the notion of tremolo*, a technique often associated with classical string performance, but here re\-imagined for the turntable, thus *making connections between hitherto disparate baroque and hip\-hop performance practices.* 

 **Multimedia Theatre.** Wright has been developing the concept of performer\-controlled sound design with the Brussels\-based Bl\!ndman ensemble \(a leading European ensembles specialising in music/sound for contemporary theatre\) since 2008. Artistic Director of Bl\!ndman, Eric Sleichim, invited Wright to join Bl\!ndman Hybrid \(a quartet formed specifically to work on music/theatre projects\) for *Beyond / Behind* \(2016\) for Kaaitheatre, Brussels **\[3.6a\]**, and *Network* at the National Theatre \(2017\), **\[3.6b\]** with leading director Ivo van Hove and starring Hollywood actor Bryan Cranston. For *Beyond / Behind* Wright was an onstage member of Bl\!ndman Hybrid and controlled the real time sampling and spatialisation of leading classical soprano Claron McFadden, allowing the audience to hear her improvisations move dynamically through the theatrical sound system as he responded in real time, *using spatialisation as an integral part of musical improvisation*. For *Network*, Wright arranged the music for live playback and created Ableton Live patches that routed Sleichim’s score directly from the performers’ laptops via the mixing desk to the 10\-channel speaker system in the National Theatre’s Lyttelton Theatre. In theatrical sound design, the placement of the sound around the audience \(spatialisation\) is usually constructed on a series of fixed cues and controlled by a sound designer at a mixing desk seated within or at the rear of the audience. In *Network*, Wright created the patches so that the Bl\!indman Hybrid musicians could contribute to the spatialisation directly from the stage. This speeded up the sound design process and added to the sense of immersion credited in reviews of the performance, with the *spatialisation of the sound around the audience having a direct, embodied connection to the on\-stage action.*

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Wright’s research offers performers and composers ways of applying DJ/club culture technology to contemporary music and sound design, across improvised music, the contemporary concert hall, and multimedia theatre. Through collaboration this has influenced creative practice, resulting in the co\-creation of new music and sound design, contributing to the creative economy and cultural programming. Beneficiaries include audiences for new music, jazz, improvisation and the theatre\-going public, creative organisations, and professional musicians. This is evidenced through supporting statements from his collaborators, recordings, airplay and live performances \(Over 200 during the assessment period\), critical reception, and audience and revenue figures. 

 **Developing new forms of improvised music.** Wright’s collaboration with saxophonist Evan Parker has significance for music audiences, record labels and festival programmers as it brings together audiences for jazz, improvised, and computer music. Wright captures and composes with sound in real time on stage, utilising technology not as a recording device, but as an instrument with which to improvise. The live performance is captured and combined with post\-production techniques to make a new recording, which mixes live performance and samples. In 2019 the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival’s \(hcmf//\) brochure detailed Wright’s contribution to Parker’s music, highlighting how prior to their collaboration Parker’s work with electronic musicians had been ‘largely responsive’, and notes how this ‘embracing new types of music’ had resulted in Parker developing a ‘rich new series of works’ that sound ‘unlike anything else in his career.’ **\[5.1\]** 

 Parker writes in support of the impact Wright has had on his creative practice and on improvised music more generally, with Wright’s insights creating new ways of using and thinking about technology, bringing new musical outcomes. Parker details that computers had until recently been ‘viewed with suspicion by the improvising community’ and highlights Wright’s role in bringing about a change in attitude **\[5.2\]**. He continues, ‘\[t\]hat I have chosen to make Matt such a key associate \[…\] is the most reliable testimony to my view of his significance as a performer. With his use of the turntable in combination with Ableton and surround sound spatialisation he has virtually created a new improvising instrument and a new conception of how recordings can be integrated into real time performance.’ In relation to a performance of *Trance Map \+* in February 2020, Parker writes how the group were left ‘feeling elated at the rewards to be had when risk taking has such a “new musical” outcome. “New music” is still possible\!’ **\[5.2\]** The approach and understandings developed in *Trance Map \+* have been utilised for spin off projects by Parker; the *Fifth Man Project*, a five\-piece group \(of which Wright was a member\) performing at Tampere Jazz Happening in Finland \(2017\); and Wright working with Parker’s Electroacoustic Ensemble for two works for hcmf// \( *Twelve for Twelve Musicians* in 2014 and *Improvisation* a 90 minute 11\-piece work which closed the festival in 2019\) **\[5.2\].** An additional piece, *Locked Hybrids* \(2020\), saw Wright working alone, using Parker’s improvised material recorded throughout their collaboration **\[5.3\].** 

 Since 2014 there have been 38 performances of *Trance Map* and *Trance Map\+* in the UK, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Finland, France, Holland, Poland and the USA **\[5.4\]**, playing to an estimated audience of over 4,100, with tickets sales estimated in the region of GBP64,000 **.** It gained thirty\-three 4/5 star newspaper reviews in English, Flemish, French, Polish, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese and Norwegian **\[5.5\].** Live performances at prestigious events and venues corroborate the significance of the work for audiences and programmers, and include Hull City of Culture \(2017\); the Cheltenham Jazz Festival \(2018\); IMPOTECH Athens \(organised by IRCAM, 2019\); and the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, USA \(2019\). The performance from Cheltenham was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 **\[5.6\]** \(BBC Radio 3 weekly audience approximately 1,900,000\). *Trance Map\+* recording *Crepuscule in Nickelsdorf* \(2019\) was released by Intakt Records \(New York City Jazz Record’s Label of the Year 2015, 2017, 2018\), with an indicator of its reception being given by a 4.5 star review in All About Jazz, which reflected Wright’s blending of the ‘real’ and ‘synthetic’; ‘\[t\]he sounds bloom and the artificial feels real and the real becomes ersatz.’ **\[5.5\]** *Locked Hybrids* was released on New York's Relative Pitch Label on 20 Nov 2020, and a new version of the work was commissioned for the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival \(performed 21 Nov 2020\) **\[5.3\].** As detailed on the hcmf// website, *Locked Hybrids* saw Wright organising Parker’s improvised material ‘into new shapes’ and allowing the listener to ‘experience an entire new side’ of the saxophonist. A feature on Wright by hcmf// highlights how Wright’s production reveals ‘the joy of listening to listening.’ **\[5.3\].** Both *Twelve for Twelve Musicians* and *Locked Hybrids* were broadcast on BBC Radio 3 **\[5.6\].** 

 **Influencing the composition and performance of contemporary concert music.** Wright’s work has been a catalyst for new ways of composing and performing developed with two leading international ensembles, Ensemble Klang and B’Rock. Writing in March 2020, Pete Harden \(Artistic Director, Ensemble Klang\) credits Wright’s influence as ‘having a profound effect on the whole ensemble’s aesthetic and working practice’ and details how his ‘philosophy of musical notation, rehearsal room technique and on\-the\-spot working practice, his knowledge of studio techniques and their implementation not just in live performance but within composition itself, and his consistent creativity’ has not only influenced collaborative projects but shapes ‘the way the ensemble now approaches a whole range of its activities.’ **\[5.7a\]** Wright’s two albums with Ensemble Klang have been streamed over 4000 times to March 2020 via Ensemble Klang's Bandcamp. *Fast Gold Butterflies* was performed by Ensemble Klang at the Dag in De Branding Festival \(2016\); Sound Festival, Aberdeen \(2018\) and premiered in an evening\-long performance named *Fast Gold Butterflies* at the hcmf// in 2018. In 2015, *Totem for Den Haag* \(2010\) was selected as one of three pieces representing UK new music \(alongside James Dillon and Rebecca Saunders\) for the UK/Mexico Dual Year \(UKMX\) organised by the British Embassy, UKTI and the British Council **\[5.7b\] \[5.7c\]**. The work was performed by CEPROMusic at the Palacio de Bellas Artes **\[5.7a\] \[5.7b\]**, one of Mexico’s most prestigious performing venues **.** 

 Wright’s composition *Corelli\_Hack* \(2016\) was commissioned by the TRANSIT Festival, Leuven for the Belgium baroque orchestra B’rock **\[5.8a\]**. After the premiere and subsequent broadcast on Klara FM \(7 Nov 2016\) **\[5.6\]** in which Wright was soloist, *Corelli\_Hack* became the title piece of a concert programme by B’rock featuring virtuoso recorder player Lucie Horsch **\[5.8b\].** Wright also performed the work as soloist with the group at Amsterdam’s Muziekcentrum, programmed alongside Steve Reich and Gyorgy Ligeti. From *Corelli\_Hack*, Wright developed *Corelli\_Thread* \(2017\), performed by Wright with saxophonist Robert Stillman and broadcast for BBC Radio 3’s Exposure **\[5.6\].** Insights developed here relating to changing orchestral string timbres via live sampling and spatialisation, are to be developed by Wright with the strings of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra as part of the UK premiere performance and BBC radio broadcast of Ingrid Laubrock’s *Drilling* for the Tectonics festival **\[5.8c\]**. Originally programmed for May 2020, this was postponed due to COVID\-19. 

 **Impact on sound design in multimedia theatre.** For *Beyond / Behind* \(2016\), Wright was recruited by composer Eric Sleichim to join music/theatre quartet Bl\!ndman Hybrid **\[5.9\]**. He was responsible for live remixing and spatialisation, particularly of Grammy\-award winning soprano Claron McFadden. In December 2020, this collaboration continued in a co\-commission for Wright with McFadden for Ensemble Klang’s ‘Musical Utopias \#3’ festival, which brought international artists together during the COVID\-19 lockdown \(performed Feb 2021\). Following *Beyond / Behind*, Sleichim chose Wright as the Musical Director for the National Theatre’s *Network* \(2017\). Wright's creation of Ableton Live patches \- assisting in routing Sleichim's electronic score from the performers onstage to the 10\-channel surround system via a Dante network \- was a component in Sleichim's sound design, which was nominated for an Olivier Award. As well as this technical contribution, Wright was responsible for rehearsing and coordinating the musicians within the immersive multimedia narrative of *Network*, as well as performing, for the entire run of 75 shows. Sleichim writes ‘I thought of Matt Wright for leading the quartet and dealing with the electronics \[…\] As I worked several times with Matt on different occasions \- him being a composer and electronic musician having played in a lot of musical situations \- I knew I could be confident. \[…\] it was of a great importance having the musical gestures of the quartet giving \[the sound design\] a human shape.’ **\[5.10a\]** *Network* was favourably reviewed in the media, including The Guardian, Time Out, The Daily Mail, Daily Express, and The Daily Telegraph, with reviewers highlighting a sense of audio/visual immersion **\[5.10b\]**. Michael Billington, in his 5\-star review in The Guardian writes: ‘\[T\]he success of the show, \[…\] lies in its capacity to use every facet of live theatre’. Quentin Lett writes in The Daily Mail, ‘for theatrical spectacle you are unlikely to find a show to match’. In The Stage, Sam Marlowe highlights its ‘pulsing soundtrack of bombastic theme tunes and Kraftwerk electronica’; and Andrzej Lukowski in Time Out writes; ‘spectacularly staged – a garish, overwhelming storm of light and sound and video’ **\[5.10b\].** *Network* was one of the NT’s ‘landmark’ productions of 2017/8 **\[5.10c\]**. Its 75 performances in London were sold out with an estimated audience of 67,000, contributing to the highest annual box office ever achieved for NT productions at the Southbank **\[5.10c\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Centenary of WW1 2014\-19 represented an opportunity for researchers to change and broaden public perceptions of the conflict’s history. Sharp used her research into women’s anti\-war activism in Germany and Britain to counterbalance the battle\-centric and thus male\-centred approach that characterised the planned commemorations. The only researcher working on German resistance to WW1 during the period, she co\-founded a national Peace History Working Group to amplify and internationalise peace narratives and bring marginalised stories to the public’s attention. 

 Her work has: 

-  raised the public profile of the anti\-war narrative during the centenary; 

-  centred women’s anti\-war activism, raising public awareness of the range of positions taken by women; 

-  inspired local history and community groups to explore anti\-war activism; 

-  changed public understanding of and attitudes to German resistance to war; 

-  changed the practice of external partners from the peace activist and engaged arts communities.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Sharp’s research locates and amplifies marginalized and hidden voices, especially those of political women and anti\-war activists. Much of her work on WW1 and its aftermath focuses on rebalancing scholarly narratives to take account of the experience of defeated nations and to make the resistance within these nations visible. She argues that including these voices does not simply add to our historical understanding, it fundamentally changes it. 

 Based on archival research conducted between 2004 and 2019, Sharp is sole or co\-author of a substantial body of academic publications on women’s organised response to WW1 and its aftermath within and beyond Germany. Since 2005, Sharp has attracted RCUK funding to consolidate links between and coordinate the activities of an international network of feminist WW1 scholars, and this is reflected in her co\-edited and co\-authored publications **\[1**\- **4\]**. 

 Her 2007 co\-edited volume **\[1\]** was the first in a series of distinctive comparative works that make Central and Eastern European scholarship accessible to Anglophone readerships through collaboration and co\-authorship. It examines women’s war activism from 1914 to 1919, with the tight time\-frame allowing international commonalities and differences to emerge. A second volume in 2011 **\[2\]** extended the sphere of investigation to women’s hitherto under\-researched transnational activism and organisation in the immediate aftermath of WW1, while a third in 2017 **\[3\]** explored women’s war activism thematically in chapters co\-authored by international teams. 

 Sharp also co\-authored three Special Issues in 2007, 2016 and 2018, of which **\[4\]** reflects on the centenary from an international gender history perspective, finding a common pattern of neglect of women’s wartime experiences in most European nations, countered by members of Sharp’s feminist scholar network intervening in public narratives **\[1\-4\]**. 

 Based on ongoing archival research into the German revolution of 1918, **\[5\]** is one of the first scholarly articles to make women visible as revolutionary political agents and place them at the centre of the narrative. This moves us beyond the stalemate of historical interpretations based on a very narrow view of the revolution in terms of time, space and sphere of action. It places the events of October \- November 1918 within a broader revolutionary cultural context, arguing that without the participation of women in widespread industrial unrest and anti\-war protest from early 1915, the revolution could not have spread. 

 Comparing feminist anti\-war activism during WW1 with the principles and implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 \(2000\), **\[6\]** examines the legacy of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, founded during WW1 and still active as an NGO today. Together with a cultural history of peace \(1815\-1920\) published in March 2020, this work challenges the periodisation that uses war and conflict as the dominant framework for interpreting the past. Focussing instead on developments conducive to fostering sustainable peace such as campaigns for social and gender justice, food security, public health and democracy allows the underlying continuities in these areas to emerge and radically changes our perspective. Sharp’s push to include dissenting and diverse voices in the historical narratives around WW1 is essential to counter persistent claims of national enthusiasm for war in either Britain or Germany. 

 Sharp’s research into marginal voices and scholarship is ongoing, with three further publications forthcoming and a book contract on international revolutionary women with Bloomsbury for submission in 2021.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Sharp noted that dissenting voices and German perspectives, particularly women’s anti\-war activism, were being overlooked in the UK’s WW1 centenary commemorations, and sought to embed them into the public narrative. The main beneficiaries were Sharp’s external partners from the peace history and activist community, the creative and heritage industries as well as theatre, conference and exhibition audiences and MOOC learners. 

 **\(i\) Peace History and Activism:** **amplifying and internationalising anti\-war voices.** 

 Sharp worked closely with leading activists within the peace community, sharing her knowledge of German anti\-war resistance and women’s role within it and inspiring others to make their own contributions to peace history awareness. This work was informed by her study of the historical roots of contemporary peace organisations and the many continuities that help us understand and measure the effectiveness of anti\-war campaigns over time. 

 The reach and resonance of Sharp’s research is reflected in the unusually high number of national and international invitations to contribute to commemorative events beyond the academy, including some high profile international events such as the German Foreign Office \(December 2014\), the Kiel Maritime Museum \(March 2016\), the Kansas National WW1 Museum, America’s official WW1 museum and memorial \(October 2017\), the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom centenary conference in Zurich \(May 2019\), and the Tshisimani Centre for Activist Education, South Africa **\[I\]**. 

 Between 2014 and 2019, Sharp’s public\-facing activities included 53 related talks, interviews, podcasts and lectures locally, nationally and internationally as well as published articles for a wider readership **\[I\]**. The scale and scope of the interventions show that Sharp’s ongoing and sustained efforts to link her historical research to present\-day anti\-war and gender activism resonated strongly with the public. In 2016, she organised two public\-facing international peace history conferences in Leeds in 2016 \(300 delegates from activist and academic communities\), that took a comparative approach across several countries to questions of gender and peace history. 

 In 2014, Sharp co\-founded the national Peace History working group, which brought activists and academics together to coordinate and amplify peace history efforts during the centenary. She worked in particular with the Convenor of the Peace History working group and Peace History Conferences at the Imperial War Museum, who is also a member of the First World War Peace Forum, and a Vice\-President of the international peace society Pax Christi. For this person Sharp’s work ‘brought an otherwise missing dimension’ to their events, and made it ‘impossible to consider planning a WW1 “peace history” event that did not examine the German experience’ **\[A\]**. She felt that Sharp’s inclusive approach ‘made a real difference, helping to bridge the gap between academics and campaigners’ and thus challenging entrenched hierarchies of knowledge. In particular, it stimulated local groups ‘to research the history of opposition to the war in their area, to create exhibitions and local events of their own to mark the centenary – and to make sure the experience of women was included’ **\[A\]**. 

 **\(ii\) **Women of Aktion:** play and exhibition** 

 **Changed Practice** 

 Sharp worked collaboratively over 18 months with partners Bent Architect Theatre Company \(BA\), on the *Women of Aktion* theatre project, focused on the Kiel Uprising **\[E\]**. BA is a socially engaged theatre company with a commitment to bringing lesser known historical stories to the contemporary stage which brings cultural value to Bradford, a culturally diverse city with a high proportion of economically deprived citizens. Sharp’s research and translations of primary sources in German allowed BA to create a historically accurate and ethically justifiable portrayal of the protagonists, which spoke powerfully to the audience’s emotions and sense of justice. BA attest that their experience of working with Sharp caused a shift from highly localised, site\-specific projects to a more ambitious national and international approach. ‘It is the first time we have toured abroad’ and ‘we reached new and wider audiences with untold history’ **\[D\]**. Sharp’s input enabled a more nuanced, layered historical understanding and gave BA access to German\-language materials. ‘It’s really brought us on professionally, I think it’s really changed the way that we will work from now on’ **\[C\]** ‘and opened up a whole new working methodology for us’ **\[D\]**. 

 **Changed Understanding** 

 The play has won critical accolades as a piece of theatre \( **\[H/i\]** ‘What’s on Stage Top Pick’ 30.10.2019\) that was ‘powerful, funny and taught me loads\!’ **\[H/iii\]** and successfully ‘sneaks research into an engaging and entertaining show.’ **\[H/iii\]** It toured in theatres in the UK and Germany, with 17 performances reaching a total audience of 1,000. Audience responses recorded on film **\[C\]** and social media show empathy with the characters’ suffering, admiration for the women and surprise, even anger, that these powerful stories had been suppressed **\[H/iii\]**. This was especially important in the German city of Kiel, where the city’s role in the revolution has historically been forgotten or considered shameful **\[F\]** and the commemoration privileged male accounts while erasing women’s history. One viewer commented: ‘The actors play their roles with such appealing energy that you can’t help sharing their outrage at being left out of the history of the revolution.’ **\[H/iii\]** 

 Sharp also worked with the Chair of the Bradford Peace Museum to produce an exhibition entitled *Women of Aktion* informed by her research insights into women’s contribution to the Kiel Uprising of November 1918. The exhibition has so far been displayed at the Bradford Peace Museum, a pop\-up shop in Bradford city centre, MShed Bristol, Manchester Central Library, Manchester Working Class Library, Leeds City Museum, Glasgow Women’s Library and Richmond Barracks, Dublin, mostly accompanied by public talks. Commenting on the Bradford iteration, the Museum Chair noted that ‘For a largely British audience, used to a male, military, patriotic and establishment analysis of that time, it was revelatory to engage with narrative and critique that were female, civilian, German and revolutionary’ and that Sharp’s input had ‘changed the historical understanding and perception of all who engaged with it’ **\[B\]**. Responses elsewhere have included emotional engagement and identification with the revolutionary women: ‘\[t\]he rallying call of revolutionary German foremothers echoes down the century’ **\[H/iv\]** \(Tweet 30/08/2019\). 

 Further plans to exhibit as part of the Newington Green Revolutionary Ideas since 1708 festival  in April\-May 2020 were interrupted by COVID\-19. The project has an accessible database **\[G\]** that offers a template for academics wanting to work effectively with creative partners, reflections on the project and teaching materials including mini\-lectures, worksheets and summaries for schools and colleges wishing to follow up on topics raised by the project. 

 **\(iii\) MOOC: **Changing Faces of Heroism 

 Sharp led the Leeds bid to work in partnership with the BBC, culminating in the BBC/Futurelearn MOOC ‘Changing Faces of Heroism’/’Heroism through Art and Culture’. This reached a global audience \(39,172 participants from all inhabited continents registered from October 2014 to December 2018\) and attracted highly positive evaluations and 22,550 unique participant comments, 2,344 specifically on Germany **\[J\]**. Sharp’s transnational anti\-war activism research was prominent in the course, challenging dominant attitudes to heroism coded as masculine and nationalist. 

 Participants’ comments and engagement reveal that they thought more comparatively and critically about a wider range of heroic figures, including women, war resisters and German nationals as the course progressed. E.g. ‘Where have I been all this time\! I have been giving the women who took part in the war very little consideration and got swept along with the attention given to the men’ **\[J\]** \(comment ID 2555400\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers at Imperial College demonstrated that existing ultrasound criteria used to diagnose miscarriage were unsafe, incorrectly diagnosed miscarriage in up to 8% of cases and resulted in healthy pregnancies being terminated. 

 The subsequent formulation, validation and adoption of new diagnostic criteria has prevented termination of >1,200 healthy wanted pregnancies each year in the UK and resulted in a rapid revision of miscarriage guidelines across the world. 

 Furthermore, parallel studies demonstrated that early pregnancy loss frequently resulted in post\-traumatic stress leading directly to its inclusion in the National Bereavement Care Pathway and intense media interest highlighting the psychological consequences of miscarriage internationally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Accurate diagnosis of miscarriage in early pregnancy \(i.e. up to 12 weeks’ gestation\) is of critical importance as an incorrect diagnosis may result in termination of a healthy pregnancy. Diagnosis is made difficult by the limitations of ultrasonography to visualise embryonic structures as well as uncertainties over the gestational age in many cases. 

 At Imperial College between 2011 and 2015, Professor Tom Bourne conducted a prospective multi\-centre observational study investigating the limitations of the existing definitions of miscarriage \(1, 2\). A total of 3,192 women were recruited from early pregnancy assessment units in seven hospitals: four university hospitals in London \(St George’s, Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea, St Thomas’, and St Mary’s\), one university hospital outside London \(Princess Anne, Southampton\), and two London general hospitals with university affiliations \(Chelsea and Westminster, and Northwick Park\). This collaborative network was made possible by Imperial’s strong national networks links as well as its clinical reputation. 

 Data were collected in two phases. First, in an initial development study, 1,600 women were recruited consecutively between September 2010 and March 2011 at the four London university hospitals \(1\). Standardised ultrasound data relating to gestation sac and embryo size, as well as fetal growth, were collected at the initial scans and at follow up examinations. The results demonstrated that the cut\-off values used to define miscarriage were unsafe. 

 This development study prompted a consensus meeting attended by Professor Bourne and subsequent publication of a review paper in the *New England Journal of Medicine*, which adopted the revised guidelines to diagnose miscarriage proposed by the Imperial group \(2\). 

 A follow\-on study aimed to validate both the development study findings and the subsequent guideline changes by establishing the performance of the new miscarriage diagnostic criteria with high levels of certainty \(3\). Secondary aims were \(a\) to examine the influence of gestational age on interpretation of key measurements and \(b\) to determine the optimal intervals between scans and identify findings on repeat scans that definitively diagnose pregnancy failure. 

 The study validated the initial finding that the measurements of mean gestation sac diameter and embryo size used in earlier guidance were likely to lead to miscarriage being diagnosed in a significant number of healthy pregnancies \(as many as 1 in 12 false positives\) \(3\). 

 During these Imperial\-led studies, the researchers became acutely aware of the frequent and severe psychological consequences of miscarriage. To address this, a pilot study, in which women were given validated questionnaires for depression, anxiety and post\-traumatic stress disorder one and three months after an early pregnancy loss was undertaken. This demonstrated that as many as 38% of women suffered moderate to severe post\-traumatic stress three months after an early pregnancy loss \(4\). 

 A subsequent study of 737 women given validated questionnaires three, six and nine months after an early pregnancy loss showed that at least 20% of women still had moderate to severe post\-traumatic stress symptoms nine months after miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy \(5\). In October 2020 the group published complementary findings in 386 partners of women experiencing early pregnancy loss demonstrating that although less frequent 7% of partners had post‐traumatic stress at one month, 8% at three months and 4% at nine months \(6\).

 By demonstrating that the criteria used to diagnose miscarriage were unsafe, the initial development study conducted by Prof Bourne and colleagues in 2010/2011 prompted a consensus meeting attended by Prof Bourne in the United States. This meeting led directly to the publication of a review paper in the *New England Journal of Medicine* that used the Imperial data to propose new safe diagnostic criteria \(research reference 1 above\). The Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology \(RCOG\) in the UK published an addendum to its guidance within a week of the initial development study being published following an urgent meeting of its ultrasound committee \[ **A**\]. 

 Data reported in the validation study published in the *BMJ* in 2015 enabled recommendations to be made on the follow up of women deemed at risk of a miscarriage, providing information on how long to wait before repeating ultrasound examinations and what to expect to see on those examinations. 

 Following the publication of the validation study in the *BMJ*, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published a practice bulletin in 2016 citing the Imperial\-led research as the driver behind changing the diagnostic guidelines for miscarriage in the United States \[ **B**\]. In 2018, the Australasian Society for Ultrasound in Medicine also published new guidelines for miscarriage diagnosis using the Imperial criteria \[ **C**\]. In the same year, the American College of Radiology updated their guideline by adopting the updated criteria \[ **D**\]. Now countries throughout the world, including France and Italy, have changed to the new criteria for miscarriage diagnosis based on the data generated by the Imperial College team \[ **E, F**\]. These changes in guidance were prompted by Imperial data showing existing diagnostic criteria were unsafe and have resulted in the implementation of safer criteria based on the Imperial study. 

 Prior to these guideline changes, it is possible that thousands of wanted pregnancies throughout the world may have had surgical or medical treatment for a miscarriage based on a misdiagnosis. The data generated from the research at Imperial College has shown that, using the existing guidelines, the risk of a misdiagnosis using embryo size measurements and an apparent lack of a visible heartbeat on ultrasonography was at least 8% \(just over 1 in 12\), leading in many cases to unnecessary termination of a wanted pregnancy. 

 An American study suggested that for women presenting with a possible miscarriage, about 12% may have been given an incorrect diagnosis of miscarriage using the guidance that existed in the United States prior to the Imperial study \[ **G**\]. Applying such calculations to the UK, as many as 1,200 healthy wanted pregnancies could have been terminated each year owing to an incorrect diagnosis of miscarriage. 

 Furthermore, the novel findings from the Imperial study investigating post\-traumatic stress in women following early pregnancy loss attracted intense media interest and were presented at the “All Parliamentary Group on Baby Loss” in the House of Commons \[ **H**\]. This work directly resulted in the inclusion of early pregnancy loss in the National Bereavement Care Pathway \[ **I**\], an initiative that is dedicated to ensuring that bereaved parents are offered equal, high quality, individualised, safe and sensitive care in all hospitals in the UK. 

 The publication of the full paper in 2020 describing the psychological impact of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy received one the biggest media coverage of any story from Imperial College and trended on social media in the UK. It was covered throughout the world, increasing awareness of the important long\-term psychological consequences of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage and enabling women to tell their stories. This was exemplified by two leading articles in the Guardian in which readers described their experiences of the pain of miscarriage \(>120,000 print subscribers > **350,000 digital subscribers**\) \[ **J**\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Smith’s research demonstrated that replacing sedentary behaviour with physical activity benefits health. The findings of his research led to the development and implementation of a workplace wellbeing initiative, which subsequently improved health, e.g. body composition and workplace stress, of 8,600 employees. In addition, Mitie Corporation which commissioned the initiative generated income from its sale. 

 Dr Smith’s research also led to the development and implementation of a school wellbeing initiative called Active Movements, which, working across London and the Home Counties, has supported 25,000 pupils with beneficial health parameters, such as physical functioning and body composition. 

 Between both initiatives, three jobs have been created. 

 Impact is also demonstrated through initiatives in the College of West Anglia and a primary school based in Murcia, Spain, with observed health benefits as above. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning body of research for this ICS predominantly utilised epidemiological, as well as meta\-research techniques, and demonstrates that replacing sedentary behaviour with physical activity is associated with positive mental and physical health across all ages. 

 Smith utilised an isotemporal substitution model to identify that the substitution of 30 minutes of sedentary behaviour with 30 minutes of physical activity was associated with improved anxiety symptoms in adults \(Reference 1\). His other epidemiological analyses have demonstrated that each weekly hour of physical activity reduced sickness absence by 1.20 days per year \(Reference 2\). His work has identified several factors that play a role in workplace physical activity levels and sedentary time, such as: habits for movement, distance from each workstation to all other office destinations, nearest office destinations to workstation, visibility of workstations when standing, and perceived management discouragement of unscheduled breaks \(References 3 and 4\). 

 Smith has also published research about the implementation of sedentary reduction and improvement of physical activity interventions in educational environments \(References 5 and 6\). For example, key findings from the Camden Active Spaces Project, a large trial investigating the impact of school and playground layout on movement, observed a reduction in sedentary time in young children from before to after active playgrounds were implemented \(Reference 5\). Dr Smith’s other epidemiological work identified that, as children age, their physical activity levels decrease, and their sedentary time increases \(Reference 6\). 

 Taken together, this work demonstrates that replacing sedentary behaviour with physical activity may improve mental and physical health. Moreover, this work identifies appropriate correlates and strategies that may be employed to achieve the displacement of sedentary time with time spent in physical activity. The initiatives that Dr Smith designed to displace sedentary time spent with physical activity drew solely on this underpinning research.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *Smith’s research and subsequent well\-being initiatives have impacted the improvement of physical and mental health for approximately 8,600 employees and over 25,000 pupils. As a direct result, this work has created 3 jobs across all projects and generated income for both Mitie corporation and Active Movements \(neither will disclose the total sum made as commercially sensitive\).* 

###  Impact for improvement of physical activity in the workplace: 

 After reading his research, Mitie, one of the UK’s leading facilities management and professional services companies, approached Smith. This led to a £30,000 commission to Anglia Ruskin University for Smith to develop a workplace well\-being initiative designed to reduce sedentarism and increase physical activity. Mitie now sells and implements the initiative as a service package to various clients. 

 The initiative has generated income for Mitie. The cost to clients of the package ranges between £1,500 and £10,000 \(Mitie will not disclose the exact sum they have made from the initiative nor details of organisations to whom they have sold the package\). Mitie has employed one full\-time member of staff to deliver the service \(Source 1\). 

 Mitie rolled out the service at Essex County Council in January 2019, to all its 8,600 employees. Data on the behaviour of council employees was collected to determine the effectiveness of the initiative. The evaluation shows positive behavioural outcomes among those who experienced the initiative: self\-reported increased desire and motivations to be physically active and less sedentary, and self\-reported reductions of at least 8% on workplace stress and general anxiety scales \(Source 2\). 

###  Impact for improved physical activity and wellbeing in Further Education: 

 The College of West Anglia \(CWA\) approached Smith to advise on the implementation of standing desks. Awareness of such equipment and its potential health and cognitive impact came about after Dr Smith presented to college staff regarding his research \(Sources 3 and 4\). 

 Approximately 200 students were initially exposed to the standing desks from March 2019, and their performance was evaluated. Smith helped collect detailed data on the impact of the standing desks on the students’ activity levels, health, and attention in class \(Sources 3 and 4\). As a result, college lecturers, using an effort and attention scale, reported that students were able to engage at a higher level when they used the standing desks than when they used usual seated desks \(Source 3 and 4\). It is expected that this will subsequently lead to better course performance. 

 The evaluation report from CWA shows that standing desks increased students’ standing time, reduced students’ sitting time, decreased waist circumference, increased grip strength, and increased attention in class over a 6\-month period \(Sources 3 and 4\). 

 Due to the success of standing desks on students’ health, CWA has started to introduce standing desks across all three of its campuses \(King’s Lynn, Wisbech, and Milton\), serving a total of 10,000 students. 

###  Impact for active movement in schools in UK and Spain: 

 Active Movements is a large initiative set up by Dr Mike Loosemore MBE \(Chief Medical Officer for two GB Olympics sports teams\) that seeks to integrate low\-level activity into daily routine for health and well\-being. Active Movements has been developed and continuously updated based on Smith’s research, and further consultation with Smith \(Sources 5 and 6\). Active Movements became aware of Smith’s research after reading a number of his peer\-reviewed manuscripts on physical activity promotion and sedentary behaviour reduction in young people. 

 Active Movements’ flagship programme for children is a year\-long intervention designed to displace sitting with movement in primary and secondary schools. Since 2016, the programme has been implemented across Berkshire, Greater London, Sussex, Essex, and Buckinghamshire. Approximately 70 schools and 25,000 children have been exposed to the initiative to date \(Sources 5 and 6\). 

 Delivering the initiative has resulted in the creation of one full\-time position within the Active Movement company \(Sources 5 and 6\). 

 Active Movements is having profound impact on school children’s activity levels and health, evidenced through the evaluation report \(Source 6\). Compared to a matched comparison school, children in an Active Movements intervention school exhibited a better physical activity and sedentary behaviour profile, a reduction in waist circumference from an average baseline of 65.24 cm to 63.41 cm at follow\-up \(whereas waist circumference in the intervention school increased over the same period\) and, an improvement in handgrip strength of over 3kg compared to 2kg in the intervention school \(the latter being the natural increase expected over time as children develop\). 

 Smith is also an Honorary Professor at the University of Murcia, Spain. In this position he was contacted by the representatives of CEIP Andrés Baquero, a primary school based in Murcia, to adapt the Active Movement programme specifically for their school. The amended version of Active Movements programme has been rolled out, and 200 students have been exposed to the intervention, with similar impacts observed to those listed above \(Sources 7 and 8\).

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers in Politics and International Relations at the University of Edinburgh played a key role in framing the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and informing vote choice. They helped voters and civil society organisations identify and understand the central issues at stake, and informed key position papers developed by officials in the UK and Scottish governments. Their empirical research underpinned claims made by both political campaigns. It also shaped journalists’ understanding and assisted broadcasters in producing TV and radio documentaries. The team informed the international community – journalists, ambassadorial and consular staff – by contextualising the campaign and guiding them in preparing for the outcome. Their analyses also framed the way the result was disseminated by major UK and international broadcasters. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The GBP5 million ESRC Future of the UK and Scotland programme \(FUS\) had its hub at the University of Edinburgh, affirming its status as a centre of excellence for the study of devolution and territorial politics. Jeffery played a crucial role as Research Coordinator, building a hub for the 20 researchers funded under the programme and bringing in many others. Within this programme, two members of the UoA \(McEwen and Mitchell\) were appointed ESRC Senior Scotland Fellows, in recognition of their research expertise and ability to inform non\-academic audiences before and after the referendum vote. McEwen and Henderson were also Co\-Is in the programme’s large grant investment that led to the creation of the Centre on Constitutional Change \(CCC\). 

 Mitchell’s decades’ long body of work on Scottish nationalism, territorial politics and devolution culminated in his monograph, *The Scottish Question* \(3.1\), completed while holding the ESRC Senior Scotland Fellowship. It set debates on Scotland's constitutional status in historical and policy contexts, noting the evolutionary rather than revolutionary nature of the independence referendum. It was recommended as one of the ‘books of year’ by the Independent’s Political editor in 2014. McEwen’s body of work on nationalism and territorial politics helped contextualise the politics of independence and union. Her work on welfare state nationalism \(3.2\) helped to explain the social democratic claims and counter claims of both the Yes Scotland and Better Together campaigns. Her research undertaken as ESRC Senior Scotland Fellow identified the necessity, challenges and opportunities of maintaining Scottish\-UK inter\-institutional relations in the event of independence, with comparative analysis of cross\-border relations in Denmark and Ireland \(3.3\). Henderson’s research on political behaviour demonstrated the civic nature of Scottish national identity, conditions under which it is mobilised by political actors, and the primacy of Scottish as opposed to British identity among voters. She and Jeffery led an international study of public attitudes that identified that citizens in ‘stateless’ nations like Scotland who shared a strong sub\-state territorial identity also had stronger social and economic solidarity with the sub\-state nation rather than the nation\-state \(3.4\). Henderson also used the opportunities of the referendum to disseminate findings from survey research as it was analysed \(prior to academic publication\). This research, under the *Scottish Referendum Study* \(with Mitchell as Co\-I\), the *Attitudes to Risk and Constitutional Change in Scotland*, and *the Future of England* survey \(all part of the FUS programme\), enabled her to chart and explain in real time how attitudes to risk were shaping choices in the referendum \(later set out in 3.5\). 

 In addition to the core territorial politics team, the programme drew upon the expertise of the UoA’s IR scholars, who adapted their knowledge of sovereignty and security challenges faced by small nation states in the international community. Neal’s expertise on critical security studies was adapted to identify the security challenges that would confront an independent Scotland. Kaarbo’s extensive research on role theory and foreign policy has highlighted the domestic and international constraints on the foreign policy choices of nation\-states, including small European states. Together, they led an ESRC Seminar Series for IR and security scholars and policy makers to examine the foreign policy and security implications of independence. The research insights this series generated were disseminated in real time, later appearing in academic publication \(3.6\). The team also drew in early career scholars and post\-doctoral fellows to offer their research insights in the referendum campaign.

 4. Details of the impact 

 The team had extensive reach with key audiences throughout the referendum campaign. They informed and evaluated campaign claims, influenced understanding of the referendum amongst the international community and the media, and helped citizens to understand and engage with referendum debates, thus supporting their participation and vote choice. 

 Informing Voters Face\-to\-Face 

 The team organised public events involving over 2,500 participants in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee and Stirlingshire. These included interactive conferences, independence negotiation simulations, events at the Edinburgh International festivals, women\-focused events, and high school debates for first\-time voters. Asked whether our events helped them ‘understand the issues at stake in the independence referendum’, 60% of participants indicated that the event ‘ *helped a lot*’, and 40% said it ‘ *helped a little*’; 97% of attendees said they had their questions answered \(5.1\). To help access ‘hard to reach’ groups, some events were developed with key partners, including Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Workers Educational Association \(WEA\), the Carnegie Trust, Engender, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, ACOSVO, and the Scottish Youth Parliament. The impact of these was highlighted by the Director of the WEA Scotland, when she reported: “ *We could not have had a better partner in framing and informing this critical debate… Speakers brought a balance of authority and clarity to their task and both proved instrumental in helping audience members reach a decision on how to vote”* \(5.2\). 

 Impartial Guidance through Digital Outreach 

 In the year leading to the referendum, our online dissemination included 394 blogs; 88 briefing papers; 63 media releases; 5 infographics; and 14 videos on a dedicated FUS YouTube channel. These had extensive reach and influence \(5.1\): 

-  The FUS website attracted 135,942 unique visitors who made a total of 203,069 visits to perform 440,756 page views, the majority from Scotland. 

-  During August/September 2014, the FUS Twitter feed generated 2,400 impressions per day, 1,100 retweets and 2,700 link clicks. 

-  An independence referendum MOOC \(Massive Open Online Course\) delivered in the final weeks of the campaign had 9,000 participants, including journalists, diplomats and officials, as well as members of the public seeking clarity on the referendum issues. 

-  An e\-book, *Scotland’s Decision*, secured over 100,000 downloads, including 56,425 from our website, 26,000\+ from the Hunter Foundation and tens of thousands via the Sunday Times and Amazon. 

 Qualitative user feedback demonstrated that this material influenced understanding and decision\-making. One reader commented that *Scotland Decides* was “ *informative and very helpful in determining which way I voted*” \(5.3\). Participants in the MOOC also found this material indispensable in deciding how to vote. One user stated that *“this course… really helped me to make a decision which I felt was well informed and the correct decision for me”*. Another noted that *“it's excellent that this course has decreased the number of people unsure of their decision whether Scotland should be independent or not. The course has also made me see both the Yes and No arguments more clearly”* \(5.4\). 

 Shaping Parliamentary Deliberation, Government Positions and Campaigns 

 The team nurtured relationships with key actors on both sides of the referendum debate, earning cross\-party respect as an authoritative, impartial source. The Scottish Government’s Director General of Strategy and External Affairs testified that he *“particularly appreciated the on\-going engagement the academics involved in the Programme had with both governments*”, expressing hope that “ *this sets a new standard in how Government and the Academy engage in the future”* \(5.5\). 

 Prior to the referendum, each member of the core team was invited to give expert oral evidence to four Scottish parliamentary committees exploring the potential impact of independence, as well as the House of Commons Public Affairs Select Committee and the National Assembly for Wales \(5.6\). Mitchell and McEwen were cited on the websites and blogs of both the *Yes Scotland* and *Better Together* campaigns \(5.3\). The team also set up an academic\-government welfare group, to explore with officials servicing the *Scottish Government’s Expert Group on Welfare* the challenges and opportunities that independence would present to the social security system. They met with the Cabinet Office, Department of Work and Pensions \(DWP\), HM Treasury and Department for Energy and Climate Change to inform the UK Government’s *Scotland Analysis* policy papers, published ahead of the referendum. McEwen’s research on welfare was subsequently cited in a lengthy quotation in the DWP’s *Scotland Analysis* paper \(5.7, p.79\-80\). 

 The team helped contextualise the referendum and its potential outcomes for government and parliamentary representatives from across the globe. Jeffery and McEwen informed EU parliamentarians and officials through stakeholder workshops and a partnership with the Brussels\-based European Policy Centre, and McEwen addressed the Canadian federal government on referendum campaign dynamics and potential outcomes. The team briefed visiting ambassadors and consular staff and engaged extensively with the local consular community. The then Irish Consul General to Scotland noted that: 

 *“… I have no doubt that the quality of my contribution to the important internal policy processes within the Irish system would not have been anywhere near as substantial or effective had it not been informed by the excellent work and outputs of the Centre for Constitutional Change team”* \(5.8\). 

 Informing the Informers and Framing the Result 

 The team worked closely with journalists, providing 63 media releases and at least 219 interviews to the domestic and international media, reaching 38 countries \(5.1\). Highlights included \(5.9\): the BBC’s *Our Friends in the North* documentary, featuring Mitchell and broadcast ahead of the launch of the Independence White Paper; helping to design and deliver the BBC’s *Scotland’s Top Ten Battlegrounds*, in which McEwen and Jeffery featured prominently; Scottish Television’s \(STV\) schools’ debate *Referendum – The Next Generation,* for which Mitchell acted as key adviser and chaired the judges’ panel; a co\-designed feature on BBC1’s *The One Show* \(audience c.5 million\) featuring McEwen; interviews on all main UK network news channels in the UK, and major international networks including CNN and Xinhua. International journalists noted the value of this input in helping to enhance understanding of the debate on Scottish independence. For example, the news agency Asahi Shimbun, whose London correspondents are run out of Tokyo, noted: 

 “… *the challenge for a foreign media organisation is to convey to its readers all the pertinent information both historic and current as concisely and clearly while doing so to a tight deadline.  Our correspondents simply could not have done this without the help on many levels – interviews, briefings, releases etc. – which the team provided.""* 

 Assistant London Correspondent, Asahi Shimbun \(5.1\) 

 The team also played a leading role in framing coverage of the Referendum count on BBC1, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5 Live, ITV, Al Jazeera, CNN and BBC World. Jeffery, McEwen, Mitchell and Henderson served as presenters’ friends throughout the night on BBC1, Radio 4/5 Live, BBC World Service, ITV and Scottish Television \(5.9\). Our team of early career researchers also featured prominently in the real\-time media coverage and early interpretation of the results. The team was the first to identify the fact that, although the SNP was on the losing side in the referendum, the party and the independence movement had been strengthened by the campaign, and that the result had triggered a constitutional chain reaction, destabilising constitutional settlements in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. On the 17 and 18 September, the CCC team averaged an interview request every 15 seconds \(5.1\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Classics in UK state schools was in decline. Dr Liveley’s research into the ancient science of storytelling and into ancient science\-themed myths produced new activities, materials, resources, and approaches to teacher\-training that resulted in the ongoing and sustained uptake of Classical subjects since 2017 at both primary and secondary level for over 10,000 state pupils: 75\+ schools in the South West and Wales introducing Classics into the timetabled school curriculum; 20\+ schools locally and nationally \(from Aberdeen to Penzance\) introducing curricular or extra\-curricular Classics\-themed storytelling activities; 3 universities incorporating Classics into PGCE teacher training; 2 museums using Classics to train facilitators and to enhance visitor experience; and a national charity changing practice to champion Classics through storytelling. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the impact of this project was undertaken by Dr Genevieve Liveley \(Lecturer/Senior Lecturer/Reader in Classics at the University of Bristol 2005\-present\) and has two complementary strands. 

#  The science of stories: New investigations into the history of narratology 

 Liveley’s research in this area demonstrated that this field of study has – from its earliest origins in the writings of Plato and Aristotle through to the latest twenty\-first century cyber\-narratologies – represented itself as a scientific enterprise. Narratology is concerned with the technology of storytelling and the ways in which stories *programme* human audiences in similar ways to the AI programming through which machines develop artificial intelligence. In light of this research, we can now better understand the ways in which narrative shapes our knowledge and understanding of our past, present, and future worlds **\[3.1\-3.3\]**. 

#  New investigations into the roles of artificial intelligence \(AI\), robots and cyborgs in myth 

 AI, robots, and cyborgs unexpectedly play a role in classical myths and narratives that are almost 3,000 years old. Ancient storytellers such as Homer, Hesiod, and Ovid describe cyborg slave girls made of gold, and female living statues \(anticipating modern mythmaking around sex and companion robots\); a humanoid bronze giant Talos \(a precursor to the 20<sup>th</sup> century Terminator character\); and ships that ‘navigate by thought’ \(anticipating the driverless cars of the 21<sup>st</sup> century\). Dr Liveley’s research into these ancient myths and their reception by subsequent generations of storytellers – particularly the Roman poet Ovid – showed that public attitudes to the future of AI, robots, and cyborgs in society were being shaped \(effectively ‘programmed’\) by their experience of AI, robots, and cyborgs in fiction. This research discovered that 21<sup>st</sup> century stories about this supposedly new science were repeating very ancient patterns. **\[3.1, 3.3\-3.6\].** 

 The underpinning research for this project has been developed and showcased in a range of published outputs and an open\-access\-article on ‘Why Sex Robots are Ancient History’ \( [<ins>http://theconversation.com/why\-sex\-robots\-are\-ancient\-history\-58112</ins>](http://theconversation.com/why-sex-robots-are-ancient-history-58112): 32,081 readers; 10\+ republications worldwide\). Further research insights were developed and shared through wider public engagement and knowledge exchange at high\-profile public lectures, science conferences, and public events. For example, an invited lecture on Ovid’s artificial creatures at a New York public think tank event celebrating the legacy of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* in April 2016, and a keynote lecture on Ovid’s Pygmalion at the Second International Conference on Love and Sex with Robots \(December 2016\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Dr Liveley’s innovative research has underpinned and informed her engagement with schools, teacher training bodies, and charities across the UK, leading to the following impacts during this REF period: reversing the decline of Classics studies through improved resources and interventions; enhanced resources developed for and adopted by teacher training programmes in Wales and the South West; new award schemes developed through national campaigns with charities; enhanced science communication and visitor experience at two major museums in Bristol and Bath. 

#  Chapter 1: Reversing the decline of Classics studies across the UK through improved resources and interventions 

 Since the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1988, the teaching of Classics \(comprising four related subjects: Latin, Ancient Greek, Classical Civilisation, and Ancient History\) has seen a steep decline – especially in state schools. Across all schools, the number of students taking Latin at GCSE dropped from 16,023 in 1988 to 10,908 in 1998. Following major curriculum reforms in 2015, national exam boards withdrew 10 awards in Classical subjects, and the subject saw a further decline – with the biggest fall in the state sector. In 2016, the total number of students taking any classical subject at GCSE was 15,152 and only 6,581 took a Classical subject at A level; GCSE numbers dipped to a historic low of 14,480 in 2017, and A Level numbers continue to decline – decreasing by 27.4% in the period 2016\-2020 \(source: FFT Education Data Lab Analysis\). This decline represents a significant threat to the skills pipeline for the discipline and its future research base. Dr Liveley’s goal was, therefore, to use the two related strands of her research into storytelling **\[3.1\-3.3\]** and into ancient myths about AI, robots, and cyborgs **\[3.1, 3.3\-3.6\]** to drive forward the sustainable uptake of Classical subjects at primary and secondary levels, with particular focus on the state sector. 

 As a result of Dr Liveley’s research\-informed engagement with schools over 2016 to 2020, as detailed below, entries in Classical subjects at GCSE have increased across the UK since 2017, with a \+6.6% increase from 2016\-2020 \(over the same period, the 16\-year\-old population has changed by \+0.8%\). 

 From March 2016, Dr Liveley began giving a series of popular public lectures on her research into ancient stories about AI, robots, and cyborgs **\[3.1, 3.3\-3.6\]** to teachers and students across the South West region. As a result, in the summer of 2016, she received a project grant from national charity Classics for All \( [<ins>https://classicsforall.org.uk/</ins>](https://classicsforall.org.uk/)\) to set up a regional Hub to work towards widening access to Classics:  [<ins>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/</ins>](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/). Between September 2016 and April 2020, the Hub worked with 105 state schools across the South West and Wales \(24 primaries and 81 secondaries\), delivering workshops, conferences, and competitions; training and mentoring non\-specialist teachers; both designing and providing physical and digital teaching resources; and facilitating access to national grant schemes **\[5.1\]**. Indeed, between September 2016 and April 2020, the Hub helped a total of 67 schools \(24 primaries and 43 secondaries\) from its wider schools network to secure funding from Classics for All grant schemes **\[5.2, 5.7\]**. This enabled over 800 state school pupils in the South West to regularly study some kind of Classics throughout the 2016/17 school year; a further 1,700 state school pupils to study Classics on the curriculum on a regular basis \(mainly through English lessons\) in 2017/18; another 2,300 to study Classics regularly in 2018/19; and over 5,700 state pupils across the region to study classical subjects in the 2019/20 academic year – resulting in more than 10,500 students overall being involved in regular Classics for All funded classroom activities in the South West and Wales between 2016 and 2020 **\[5.2, 5.7\]**. 

 Drawing together both strands of her research **\[3.1\-3.6\]** and aiming to translate this into a school\-friendly format, in December 2017, Dr Liveley engaged 6 schools as her community partners in the co\-creation of a new set of classroom resources on the ‘Science of Stories’: \( [<ins>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/resources/</ins>](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/resources/)\) – hereafter, SoS. She worked closely with the schools to translate her underpinning research into an interactive flipbook \( *The Science of Stories* – available in digital and physical format\) plus supplementary materials \(including videos, experiments, lesson plans, and quizzes\) for use in school science lessons, cross\-curricular lunchtime and breakfast clubs, gifted and talented groups, debate groups, storytelling societies, and extra\-curricular Classics clubs. From the autumn of 2018, multiple copies were distributed to over 600 schools nationwide **\[5.9\]**. The impact has been deep and wide\-ranging. One teacher reports that the ‘cross\-curricular thinking’ that SoS inspires has ‘changed teaching practice’; another that the school has ‘used the science of stories resources as a way to enrich the teaching practice of the science department, using it as a form of extension and differentiation’; and another that ‘Science of Stories \[is\] used by teachers in running a classics\-themed transition day for incoming Year 7 pupils’ **\[5.1\]**. Schools nationwide – from Aberdeen to Penzance – report using these resources for extra\-curricular or curriculum\-extension activities, including to promote Classics to their feeder primary schools, and to complete the Olympus Challenge Award **\[5.1, 5.6\]**. 

 The impact for the beneficiaries of the Hub’s combined interventions has been transformative. Each year, 4,000\+ pupils across 75 state schools \(59 secondaries and 16 primaries\) in the South West and Wales who previously were not offered any Classics now experience some form of Classics on the curriculum; another 9 schools now offer extra\-curricular Classics – and 15 schools have introduced a new Classics subject at GCSE or AS Level, including GCSE Greek **\[5.1\]**. The Programme Director for Classics for All states ‘the geographical coverage of the Bristol Classics Hub \(including many hard\-to\-reach rural school districts\) is such that we have recently taken steps to establish two additional Hubs to pick up its work in the coastal South West and in Wales’ **\[5.2\]**. One teacher reports that the impact ‘has led to the school actually offering Latin/Classics as a subject, where previously it wasn’t’; another that ‘simply put, Classics wouldn't be where it is now in our school without \[your\] support, and hundreds of children would never have encountered the ancient world in a classroom setting’ **\[5.1\]**. 

#  Chapter 2: Improving Classics resources for teacher training programmes across the South West and Wales 

 Through the Hub, Dr Liveley facilitated training for 300\+teachers in the South West and Wales between 2016 and 2020 **\[5.1, 5.2\].** In July 2017, she was invited by PGCE Directors at two South West universities to draw on her research \(and, later, her SoS resources\) to help provide training and resources for local state schools to introduce myths from the Roman poet Ovid into a new storytelling initiative in English teaching \( [<ins>https://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/for\-schools/ovidcompetition/</ins>](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/classics/hub/for-schools/ovidcompetition/)\). At the same time, she became Chair of the local branch of the Bristol Classical Association and relaunched a regional Latin drama festival to support English teachers in secondary and primary schools in encouraging students to perform Latin stories \( [<ins>https://www.bristol.ac.uk/arts/events/2019/june/festival\-of\-latin\-drama.html</ins>](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/arts/events/2019/june/festival-of-latin-drama.html)\). Both events are now embedded annual programmes and have seen the introduction of Classics\-based storytelling into English classrooms and curricula in 17 state secondary schools \(involving 200\+ Year 7 & 8 pupils each year\) and 2 state primaries **\[5.1, 5.3\]**. Dr Liveley further developed and delivered cross\-curricular training and resources for English, Science, and Foreign Language teachers and PGCE trainees in the South West. Between 2016 and 2020, she directly trained 100\+ teachers and 180\+ trainees from 49 state secondary schools, using the SoS resources to help non\-specialist teachers and trainees introduce Classics into their teaching – and to qualify for the ‘Classics in the Classroom’ certificate awarded by national charity Classics for All **\[5.1\-5.3, 5.6, 5.8\]**. One science teacher and year 12 tutor reports using these resources to ‘spark interest’ in etymology and mythology with his students **\[5.1\]**; and in March 2020 \(at the start of Covid\-19 school closures\), the PGCE Director of English at UWE contacted all PGCE English Partnership Schools recommending the ‘excellent resources from University of Bristol’ among a pack of online resources for the community to use during the crisis **\[5.8\]**; a Liverpool schools direct \(SCITT\) trainer working with Primary Education lecturers at Liverpool College and Liverpool Hope University is also using the SoS resources to help train new teachers \(‘2 last year, 1 this year, 4 next year’\) **\[5.1\]**. 

#  Chapter 3: New national award schemes recognising Classics engagement by pupils and PGCE students 

 The substance and reach of the impact achieved in schools both regionally and nationally was greatly facilitated by new partnerships with national charity Classics for All \( [<ins>https://classicsforall.org.uk/</ins>](https://classicsforall.org.uk/)\) \(from July 2016\); and national advocacy campaign *Advocating Classics Education* \(ACE\) \( [<ins>http://aceclassics.org.uk/</ins>](http://aceclassics.org.uk/)\) \(from May 2017\). Both helped to promote and distribute SoS resources nationwide and describe a mutually beneficial relationship which has transformed the way they work to support Classics in state schools across the UK, commending the ‘scale of the Classics outreach that has been achieved’ **\[5.2\]** and ‘the greater number of schools that are now teaching Classics in the Southwest ... as a result of Dr Liveley’s leadership’ **\[5.10\]**. In March 2019, in collaboration with Dr Liveley, Classics for All developed a new award scheme \(endorsed by a number of universities and further education partners\) to recognise the work of students who are studying Classics on an extra\-curricular basis or as a non\-examined curriculum subject \( [<ins>https://classicsforall.org.uk/get\-involved/schools/grants\-and\-support\-for\-schools/events\-news/</ins>](https://classicsforall.org.uk/get-involved/schools/grants-and-support-for-schools/events-news/)\). An independent learning version of the ‘Olympus Challenge’ for children studying at home during the Covid\-19 crisis, and a ‘Classics in the Classroom’ award for PGCE students in the South West and Wales were launched in April 2020. For the independent study award, Dr Liveley’s SoS resources are referenced as key materials for the ‘Story Explorer’ and ‘Artist in Residence’ badges. And for the ‘Classics in the Classroom’ award, the SoS resources are suggested as key materials for the ‘Cross\-curricular’ module, and the ‘Ovid in the Westcountry Competition’ suggested as an activity to fulfil the conditions of the ‘Myth’ module **\[5.6\]**. One teacher from Wales, who piloted the ‘Olympus Challenge’ through the Hub reports that: ‘In a year where regular examination has been disrupted, the Olympus Challenge stands out as the single great, tangible achievement since the summer’ and downloads of SoS resources show a pandemic\-related home\-schooling peak in April 2020 **\[5.1, 5.2, 5.6, 5.9\]**. 

#  Chapter 4: Enhancing curatorial practice and visitor experience at two major regional museums 

 Dr Liveley also formed partnerships with two local museums to help her translate her research into a more accessible and attractive format for schools and children – and to promote regional interest in Classics outside of the classroom. She worked closely with the science centre We the Curious from 2016 to co\-create new story\-focused activities for the museum’s events programme. The impact of Dr Liveley’s collaboration with We the Curious involved new ways to enhance visitor experience and a step\-change involving a new narrative approach to science communication. The education team report that this ongoing partnership has not only ‘enhanced their understanding of the scientific concepts that can be explored through classical myths’ but ‘has allowed the museum to see how the arts and sciences can be bridged through narratology’ and to use this new knowledge to position itself as a hub for the exchange of cultural \(rather than purely scientific\) knowledge, bringing them a ‘new type of engagement with the public’, enhancing their public appeal and future sustainability **\[5.4\]**. Dr Liveley has worked with them to: co\-create new story\-focused activities for their live\-science team; enhance staff training; co\-curate a public event \(‘Telling Stories About Robots’\) in July 2018; develop the museum’s ‘Curiosity Club’ \(a disability peer support group with charity WECIL  [<ins>http://www.wecil.co.uk/</ins>](http://www.wecil.co.uk/), discussing science\-linked topics inspired by disabled visitors – e.g., ‘Could a robot socialise with me at quiz night?’\) ; and the prototyping and piloting phase of the museum’s public programmes in their ‘Theatre of Curiosity’ \(ongoing\). The impacts of this partnership for the beneficiaries have been both educational \(using the underpinning research to enhance understanding of fictional stories shaping the realities of robot science\); and transformative \(changing the ways in which science educators and the public think and talk about robot\-themed material, and inspiring new programmes, training, and ways of working\) **\[5.4\]**. 

 In 2018 Dr Liveley also advised the Roman Baths Museum on their ‘Minerva’s Owls’ project, helping them to secure external seed\-funding and rewrite their family trails with a new focus on science and story:  [<ins>https://minervasowls.org/schools\-and\-minervas\-owls/</ins>](https://minervasowls.org/schools-and-minervas-owls/) <ins>.</ins>Their description of the impact of her input and research as ‘provid\[ing\] bidirectional inspiration – inspiring and being inspired’ **\[5.5\]** summarises perfectly the collaborative nature of *The Science of Stories* case study *.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into the application of Computer Vision and Machine Learning to Structural Condition Monitoring has provided impact through a change in methods utilised in inspection of structures such as railway tunnels, negating lengthy human exposure to potentially hazardous environments, minimising time and manpower requirements onsite and allowing for the time\-consuming elements of the inspection to be completed remotely. This new approach allows skilled examiners to inspect more structures than they would be able to traditionally, ultimately leading to an increase in the safety of the general public who benefit from safer infrastructure as a result of this technology. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Morison et al. have been working in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Structural Condition Monitoring for over 5 years and have made significant progress in the field. This work began in 2015 with a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Geckotech Solutions Ltd, a Specialised Access Solutions company, who in 2015 focused on the development of a data acquisition system and software package to assist examiners with the visual inspection and condition monitoring of railway tunnels. 

 This project focused primarily on effective data collection of the internal structure of railway tunnels and also included preliminary image processing\-based analysis tools \[R1, R2\]. This involved the collection of visible and thermal spectrum data which was processed off\-site using bespoke software packages developed during the KTP. This software consisted of several elements \(including image processing and computer vision algorithms for automatic change detection, structure from motion and 3D modelling \[R2, R3\]\) designed to present data to inspection engineers and clients or asset owners. This technology allows for the assessment of the structure to be completed remotely, with only the data collection requiring site access \(utilising less manpower and on\-site time which are both costly with site access alone costing several thousand pounds per shift\) with the aim of increased efficiency and a higher quality of service for customers, as well as improved health and safety for the engineers in the field. 

 This led to continued research at both the industrial partner and the university. A second KTP, an Industrial Doctorate project funded by The Data Lab and a GCU PhD studentship \(as well as numerous undergraduate and postgraduate projects\) totalled £531k of funding. At this point, the focus of the research shifted significantly from data collection and traditional image processing analysis to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning techniques to automate the assessment of surface conditions in structures \[R4, R5\]. 

 To maximise the benefit of the analytics provided, focus was also given to visualisation of the output of these algorithms in a manner which is understandable and, most importantly, of benefit to the expert examiners and our customers who must be able to make maintenance decisions based on the information presented. This work in the 3D visualisation and Virtual Reality space focuses on extracting the information generated from our Deep Learning algorithms and projecting it onto detailed 3D models of the structures. This allows both examiners and customers to view the structures in 3D on their computers or using Virtual Reality hardware. 

 GCU have continued to work in the Structural Condition Monitoring space and new partnerships for further improving health and safety in the field are being formed. Two PhD projects running in the field \(one in Artificial Intelligence and the other in Data Visualisation\) continue to produce quality outputs with the most recent publication in the Digital Signal Processing journal \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 These projects were instrumental in positioning Geckotech Solutions Ltd as the only structural monitoring company in Scotland who are utilising Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Virtual Reality to improve their services. The introduction, and continual development, of technology\-based solutions to challenges faced by the company have resulted in a number of tangible and intangible benefits. Their partnership with GCU allowed the Company ‘to offer services in a faster, safer, more accurate manner than was previously possible and the continued development of these enhanced services will be of great importance to the structural monitoring industry’. \[C1\] 

 The success of this project prompted Geckotech to launch their own R&D Department which, in collaboration with GCU, supported the second KTP, an Industrial Doctorate project funded by The Data Lab Innovation Centre and a GCU PhD studentship \(as well as numerous undergraduate and postgraduate projects\) totalling £531k of funding. 

 Financially, these projects resulted in significant growth for the company. Over the course of the projects the company saw an increase in sales turnover from £1.7 million to £3.6 million, an increase of over 100%. More impressively, the company increased their profit more than tenfold, from £18k to £200k while also increasing the number of full\-time employees from 40 to 60, a 50% increase. At the end of the KTP project, the company predicted that they would increase their sales turnover by a further £2.2 million over the three years following the project. This increase was in fact achieved over the first year. 

 One project in particular was rated as ‘Outstanding’ by Innovate UK, shortlisted for the Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards 2019 Powerful Partnership Award, the Engineering Excellence Award, and Best KTP Award at the Innovate UK KTP Best of the Best Awards 2019, where the project won the Best KTP Award. \[C2, C3\] 

 The intangible benefits of the project have been just as important as the financial success. Geckotech Solutions Ltd operate almost exclusively in dangerous and difficult to access environments. Before the KTP, Geckotech prepared for every job by preparing a risk assessment wherein the first question, ‘is it necessary to send a human into this environment?’, was always answered with ‘Yes’. The technology introduced during and after the KTP has, for the first time in 10 years of business, allowed Geckotech an alternative to this in certain situations. This is a significant advance in the level of health and safety that Structural Monitoring companies are able to provide for their employees. 

 As well as increased health and safety for employees, it is expected that we will also see an increase in public safety through increased inspection frequency and optimisation of maintenance plans. The owners and managers of assets such as railway tunnels are always looking to minimise inspection frequency due to the excessive financial cost of closing such a structure in order to conduct an inspection. The use of new technology is allowing for faster inspection and therefore shorter closures and ultimately a lower cost to clients. By decreasing the overall cost of inspection and therefore increasing the frequency, Geckotech put customers in a much stronger position to optimise maintenance schedules which will not only minimise cost to the customer but also improve the overall safety of the structure. 

 Currently, GCU are in collaboration with new companies who would be interested in taking this work forward and allowing for the continual development of the impressive work already achieved in this space. A bid for funding through Network Rail and Innovate UK was submitted in collaboration with Inspire Structures Ltd who are one of the most prominent railway tunnel inspection companies in the UK. This funding is specifically targeted at railway tunnel inspection in which Inspire have a wealth of inspection experience and GCU have a very strong prototype system developed over previous projects. 

 We have also been contacted by CENSIS who connected us with Thales who are interested in the work which GCU have been conducting in the structural monitoring space. This is another very strong industrial connection who have the potential to allow for further collaboration in the field of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence to Structural Condition Monitoring. Finally, we have been approached by Historic Environment Scotland who have an interest in our work from a preservation and restoration of Scotland’s historic monuments and structures. This would be an exceptional opportunity for GCU to refocus the work being conducted in the Structural Monitoring space to an exciting new field.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 King’s research has made a direct contribution to the preservation of global cultural heritage assets and has facilitated massive increases in free public access to digital collections of artworks and artefacts in galleries, libraries, archives and museums around the world. King’s Digital Humanities research has underpinned and enabled vital digital capacity\-building work in different African contexts, facilitating the local construction of digital collections for endangered material. King’s Digital Lab has developed exemplary digital and human infrastructures for sustainably delivering digital collections for public engagement and scholarly use. King’s research has also produced a model of impact assessment enabling cultural heritage practitioners worldwide to measure and evidence the benefits of their digital collections for their communities. The COVID\-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of King’s contribution to enabling public, open digital access to collections whose doors have \(physically\) closed. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Collaborative and practice\-based research in King’s Department of Digital Humanities \(DDH\) and King’s Digital Lab \(KDL\) has produced models of best practice for sustainable digital asset management, research software engineering and impact assessment in cultural heritage sectors. There are four interlocking and mutually reinforcing research agendas that underpin King’s impacts on cultural heritage institutions: \(i\) research on how digital collections of artworks and artefacts in galleries, libraries, archives and museums can be sustainably opened up for free public access and use \(OpenGLAM\) **; \(ii\) research on** how digital collections for endangered cultural heritage assets can be locally constructed in diverse global settings through knowledge transfer and collaboration; \(iii\) **research on** how sustainable digital and human infrastructures can deliver digital collections and facilitate scholarly engagement with them **; and \(iv\) research on** impact assessment that enables cultural heritage practitioners worldwide to measure and evidence the benefits and value to their communities of their digital collections. 

 **King’s OpenGLAM research has demonstrated that the cost of maintaining payment structures in cultural heritage collections almost always outweighs actual revenue** 

 **This research \[1\] underpinned the REF2014 Impact Case Study \(‘**Changing economic thinking **’, https://impact.ref.ac.uk/casestudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=41317\)** and has continued to be cited as the catalyst for a change in policy towards open access collections. Based upon the original research, further collaborative investigations have occurred in the current REF cycle to research and develop evidence\-based strategies for the opening of the digital collections of the US National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian \[2,7\]. 

#  **King’s research on digital archiving and the preservation of endangered collections has investigated and developed models of best practice that are transferable to diverse and operationally challenging global settings** 

 King’s has established and influenced international standards of best practice and sustainability in the digital archiving of cultural heritage through research on transferable infrastructure models that allow archivists to transform their ‘raw materials’ into usable and shareable digital collections \[3\]. King’s research has shown what can be done with digital sources after they have been captured in a high\-quality form using robust standards and methods and also what can be done to sustain and make available these materials for long term use \[4\]. Beyond technical considerations of digitisation, this research demonstrates the importance of holistic consideration of the many complex economic, legal and political factors that underpin the sustainability of archiving projects in diverse global settings. 

#  **Deep collaborations with cross\-sector practitioners have been developed through the application of research on sustainable technical and human infrastructures for digital collections** 

 King’s research has shed light on the cyber\-infrastructures that inform research, the software\-intensive methods that are producing new knowledge and the ethical issues implicit in the production of digital humanities tools and methods \[5\]. This has subsequently led to the articulation of KDL’s world\-leading Research Software Engineering model \[6\]. KDL was established as an independent outgrowth from DDH in 2015 and its creation was informed by this research on technical developments that unite practical and critical activity. 

 **King’s research has investigated mechanisms of effective impact assessment for cultural institutions’ digital collections and has produced the highly influential and widely used Balanced Value Impact Model \(BVIM\)** 

 This research constructed a synthesis of social impact and economic methodologies and techniques and resolved these through a unique set of value lenses as modes of digital cultural value \[7\]. Collaborative research with highly influential international cultural institutions has led to the development of BVIM version 2.0. This provides a compelling mechanism for the measurement of the impact of digital resources in cultural heritage contexts, allowing practitioners to gather evidence on how communities benefit.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **The four areas of King’s research described above are interlinked in their theory\-meets\-practice facilitation of massive and sustainable global openings of cultural heritage material to new audiences in diverse global settings. King’s research has changed practices of building sustainable and accessible digital collections worldwide, benefiting heritage practitioners and the many different publics they serve. It has done so through developing lasting collaborations with museum professionals and policy makers in Europe, North America and sub\-Saharan Africa. These impacts on digital collection practice have ensured the future of priceless \(and, in some cases, endangered\) collections and have radically expanded the range of people who can enjoy and make unrestricted use of them. King’s research has also strengthened practitioners’ abilities to systematically and comprehensively measure the benefits of accessible digital collections to their communities. This, in turn, further advances the case for continuing the wider OpenGLAM agenda, which King’s research has long pioneered.** 

#  **King’s research has directly contributed to massive growth in openly accessible and re\-usable collections of digitised arts and cultural heritage material in the galleries, libraries, archives and museums \(GLAM\) sector** 

 Tanner’s research on the costs of managing digital assets has influenced a shift in the sector towards open access of collections of artworks and artefacts. For example, in 2017, New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art made all images of public domain works in its collection openly available under a Creative Commons Zero \(CC0\) licence. This allows anyone to freely build upon, enhance and reuse these digital assets for any purpose without restriction under copyright or database law. The Project Lead of the initiative confirms King’s direct impact on the “transformative effort” of opening up 400,000 images: “\[Tanner\] generously contributed to change the course of art history and made possible an even more accessible panhuman experience of art across culture, space and time as embodied in The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s collection” \[A\]. Further, the research and continuing collaboration was instrumental in facilitating the National Archives and National Library of Sweden’s move to provide open access to their newspaper collection with over 1,200 titles \(some 3 million pages\) made freely accessible since 2019 \[A\]. 

 In February 2020, the Smithsonian released 3 million 2D and 3D images and directly attributed the influence of King’s research on their decision to do so and the process of achieving this. Noting challenges relating to the size of their institution, the Director of the Smithsonian’s Digitization Office states that “the move toward open access collections was a monumental undertaking that involved working through bureaucratic, cultural, and infrastructure barriers. Our ability to do so can be credited, in no small measure, to the work that Professor Tanner has done in this field for well over a decade” \[A\]. The research evidence that informed and spurred the Smithsonian’s open access initiative relates to revenue generation from in\-house rights and the intangible value of open access collections, namely increased goodwill and trust from the public \[A\]. 

 This research also led to further collaborations with the US National Gallery of Art \(NGA\), the development of their digital strategy, the instigation of an Innovation Lab and moves to full CC0 licences for their collections \[B\]. Digital assets that are made available on CC0 licences by museums and galleries spread even further into the public domain by virtue of their new accessibility to other online platforms that have greater reach than the original institutions’ collections. Events of 2020 have highlighted the importance of the public digital accessibility of cultural material. Between March and November 2020 \(through the height of the global COVID\-19 pandemic\), the 50 most viewed NGA images received a total of 39,967 views on the institution’s website. However, the same images – which the NGA could now donate to Wikimedia – received over 39 million views on those platforms \[B\]. Were it not for the impact of King’s research on the NGA’s decision to move to CC0 licences, this massive and unrestricted public access to cultural heritage material would not have been possible. 

#  **King’s research on techniques and best practices of digital archiving has been applied globally by the researchers to preserve internationally\-important and endangered cultural heritage and historical collections** 

 The reputation of King’s research on globally transferable models of digital archiving infrastructure prompted Sudanese stakeholders to reach out to King’s to provide support to their National Cultural Heritage Digitization Team. Prompted by the 2013 destruction of libraries and manuscripts in Mali by Jihadist militants, the Sudanese Ministry of Information, the Sudanese Association for the Archiving of Knowledge, along with museums, libraries and archives throughout the country, recognised the urgent need to preserve endangered cultural material. King’s Sudan Memory project \(led by Deegan\) played a central role in this endeavour, creating a collaborative infrastructure to integrate resources and facilitate use. King’s research on the economic, legal and political factors that influence the sustainability of digital archiving projects has enabled this work to continue through the difficult conditions of the revolution and accompanying instability in 2019. 

 King’s Sudan Memory project has resulted in the digitisation of 100,000 endangered cultural artefacts from 10 institutions \[C\] and has fulfilled Sudanese stakeholders’ explicit objectives to safeguard the full wealth of Sudan’s cultural heritage for both local and global audiences. The Country Director of the British Council in Sudan states that “the main impact has been the realisation in Sudan ministries, press and academic circles that the Sudanese cultural material can, and is being, captured and preserved for future generations. Without \[Sudan Memory\], many priceless Sudanese cultural records and artefacts would be forever lost to the ravages of the desert storms, or to the fading memories of those who had no investment or professional expertise to capture and preserve them” \[C\]. The work has imparted new skills and technical capacity to Sudanese partner institutions to sustain the preservation agenda. 148 Sudanese colleagues were trained in digital skills to preserve and document cultural heritage. The Sudanese Association for Archiving Knowledge \[C\] stated that “one of the key successes of the project was building consensus and a national community; and that training young people and having them work with older people who have cultural knowledge has empowered them both”. 

 Elsewhere in Africa, King’s researchers \(Hedges\) have applied their work on transferable knowledge architectures and infrastructure to undertake projects to digitally archive collections of great contemporary and historical importance, for instance archives relating to Rwanda’s post\-genocide Gacaca Courts. The Executive Director of Aegis Trust \(with which King’s collaborated\) states that “the application of King’s research in this context has facilitated the creation of \[an archive which\] digitally safeguards approximately 48 million records/digital assets relating to the Gacaca Courts. The records are a primary and reliable source of information about the Genocide, which was otherwise at severe risk of being lost, and is key for the fight against Genocide denial and revisionism, and for reconciliation among the people of Rwanda” \[C\]. 

#  **King’s research underpins the work of King’s Digital Lab: an exemplary hub for research software engineering that has directly informed the design of next\-generation infrastructure for humanities labs and arts and cultural heritage sectors around the world** 

 133 websites hosted by KDL gained a total of almost 243 million hits between August 2013 and September 2020. Of those sites, 14 together contain 1,485,229 digital assets \[D\]. The ability to build and manage sustainable infrastructure for digital collections on this huge scale has made King’s an international point of reference. The Director of The Sussex Humanities Lab notes that KDL has “created an exemplar of best practice, for how we collectively support inherited web resources” \[D\]. 

 Ensuring that national memory institutions can undertake their traditional functions in a new digital environment is a challenge that KDL’s development of a Research Software Engineering \(RSE\) model has successfully responded to. Developed through King’s research, this is a holistic model that has enabled university\-based RSE teams to deliver public impact and provides a level of operational maturity that makes collaboration with community organisations and commercial technology partners more effective. Navigating relationships and knowledge transfer between the private sector, the public sector and HE, “KDL has brought all these stakeholders onto the same page, in a way that no other centre has been able to do” \[D\]. The RSE model has influenced university and cultural heritage teams globally, informing the design of next\-generation infrastructure for the Sussex Humanities Lab, the Centre for Digital History Aarhus, Rice University, Jordan’s cultural heritage sector and Australia’s arts and humanities sector \[D\]. Aspects of the RSE model have also influenced the Royal Archives and the Bodleian Library \[D\]. 

#  **King’s research has enabled cultural heritage practitioners to measure the social, cultural and economic benefits of the resources they make available to their communities** 

 The Balanced Value Impact Model \(BVIM\) has been applied by cultural heritage practitioners all over the world as a mechanism to demonstrate to decision\-makers the value of their digital resources and collections. This has led to better management of content, more closely aligned to the needs of communities served. The impact of the BVIM on international ‘impact practice’ is evidenced through its extensive and wide\-ranging use across the cultural heritage sector. Implementations or adaptations of the BVIM include: The Wellcome Library digitisation programme; The People’s Collection Wales with the National Museum Wales; Nectar Virtual Laboratories; and Jisc’s training and guidance on ‘making digital collections easier to discover’ \[E\]. 

 A significant application of King’s BVIM is in the work of Europeana, the foundation tasked by the European Commission to develop a digital cultural heritage platform. Europeana provides access to over 58 million digital objects from more than 3,500 institutions. Its Senior Policy Advisor states that “our approach to collecting and analysing the \[impact\-related\] data rested heavily on using five of the BVI Model’s value drivers” \[F\]. The Europeana Impact Playbook \(2017\) is the culmination of this strategy and the Senior Policy Advisor notes that the BVIM “lies at the heart of the Playbook and has helped us frame and debate each step we have taken” \[F\]. The Impact Playbook has been downloaded over 2,900 times by cultural heritage professionals \[F\] and is now used across Europe in institutions such as the Rijksmuseum and Denmark’s State Museum for Art \(SMK\). A Curator and Senior Advisor at SMK states that Tanner’s research “has been instrumental in introducing a strategic awareness of the importance of impact assessment in all aspects of the organisation” \[F\]. 

 SMK has tested the Impact Playbook in its assessment of the benefits of activities it runs with open access cultural materials. For example, a 2018 ‘Taboo’ workshop allowed young people to create visual expressions of emotions related to mental/physical disorders through discussing, clipping and remixing artworks from the Museum’s collection. The Impact Playbook assessment allowed the Museum to increase their “understanding of how playful participation and engaging creative practices can help bring art and museums at eye level with young people, making them feel empowered to explore and learn about different cultures and ways of life.” \[F\] This demonstrates how King’s research has enabled institutions to evidence the benefits of opening public access to digital collections. 

 **    Overall,** King’s strengthening of practitioners’ capacity to evidence the value of digital collections for their communities allows them to further advance the case for making even more cultural heritage material freely available digitally under CC0 licences. This feeds back into the original research agenda of OpenGLAM promotion of massive and sustainable digital openings and the global preservation of invaluable cultural heritage and historical assets.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research and expert advice by Thanassoulis and Giraleas on productivity change was used to determine revenue caps for some 400 German and Dutch energy transmission and distribution companies over regulatory cycles spanning 2017\-2023. Thanassoulis provided further scientific advice in two regional court submissions \(2017, 2019\), which challenged the German regulator’s methods for computing efficiency and productivity gains for 2014\-2023. The underlying research and advice impacted the regulated energy companies – with a combined regulated turnover of over Euros 18.5 billion per annum – consultancy companies and the regulators in Germany and the Netherlands, affecting a population of over 100 million people. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research into efficiency and productivity change by Thanassoulis \(undertaken 2000\-2019\) and Giraleas \(undertaken 2012\-2017\) has extended and enhanced Data Envelopment Analysis \(DEA\), and the application of econometric analysis and index number theory.  Thanassoulis has over 70 refereed academic publications in this area, with more than 11,000 citations.These approaches are used in Europe by regulators to assess the scope for efficiency and productivity savings. Economic regulation of monopoly utilities ensures that consumers pay a fair price for services. This objective is addressed – utilising these approaches – through periodic reviews during which regulators set price or revenue caps for utilities. The *Malmquist Index* traditionally has been used as a way to measure productivity change over time. In 2004, Maniadakis and Thanassoulis \( **R1**\) enhanced and expanded the scope of the Malmquist Index, developing the *Cost Malmquist Index* which was ultimately used by the German regulator. Unlike the *Malmquist Index*, the *Cost Malmquist Index* also captures the effect of price changes on productivity. This means that productivity change calculations can now show separately the effect of changes in the quantity of inputs and outputs – as well as the effect of price changes of those inputs over time. This provides a clearer picture of the root sources of cost productivity change and is especially relevant in economic regulation where costs are the object of the regulation.In 2006, Portela and Thanassoulis \( **R2**\) refined the *Malmquist Index*. This research improved the original *Malmquist index*, which calculated productivity change with reference to an estimated benchmark, which under some circumstances can lead to biased results. Thanassoulis’ research did away with the need for a benchmark, calculating instead productivity change by using only observed levels of inputs and outputs.In 2012, Giraleas, Thanassoulis and Emrouznejad, in \( **R3**\) reviewed, compared and assessed the various methods for computing productivity change in multi\-input, multi\-output contexts, including econometric methods, Data Envelopment Analysis \(DEA\) and index numbers. The research has a special focus on *Törnqvist productivity indices* – a type of index number, used frequently, including in Germany and The Netherlands, to determine regulated utility companies’ revenue cap. The research allows for better\-informed models to calculate industry\-specific, long\-run productivity growth estimates.In other key work \( **R4**\) into Data Envelopment Analysis \(DEA\), the broad central method used by regulators, Thanassoulis has defined the ""unit of assessment” and the process for setting up a DEA model in terms of the inputs and corresponding outputs of those units. These concepts – as well as the role of outliers – were expanded on by Thanassoulis, Portela and Despić \( **R5**\). The identification of suitable inputs and outputs, and the treatment of outliers, play a vital role in economic regulation. This is because the companies whose efficiencies and productivity change over time are to be assessed are large, with complex and interwoven activities which must all be suitably captured in the modelling process.Overall, the research of Thanassoulis and Giraleas has expanded, enhanced and improved the modelling processes used in economic regulation.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Aston research has had a material impact on the policy, practice and process of estimating efficiency and productivity changes at firm and sector level for regulatory purposes in Germany and the Netherlands. These two countries have a combined population of over 100 million and regulated expenditure of more than €18.5 billion per annum. 

 The research has changed the policy and practice of the economic regulation of electricity and gas transmission and distribution service operators \(TSOs and DSOs\) in Germany and the Netherlands, covering regulatory cycles between 2017 and 2023. The impacts were channeled via consultants to the regulators. The beneficiaries are consultancy companies Oxera and Polynomics and the regulators and regulated energy companies operating in Germany and The Netherlands, collectively influencing the energy prices for over 100m people. 

 We claim three main areas of impact: 

 **1. Computing revenue caps for regulated TSOs and DSOs in Germany** This impact relates to the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Cost Malmquist and Tornquist methods \(R1, R3 respectively\) used by the German energy regulator BNetzA in 2017 to compute the “Xgen” \( **S1**\). The Xgen is the industry\-specific annual productivity change benchmark figure and is critical component in determining revenue caps for 401 gas and electricity DSOs and TSOs serving a combined population of 80 million. 

 In preparation for the gas and electricity regulatory cycles covering 2017\-2023, BNetzA requested energy companies to submit their responses to its proposed methodology for calculating the Xgen. One of these energy companies, the TSO Netze BW, commissioned a consultancy firm \(Polynomics\) to advise it on its response. Polynomics recommended \( **S3**\) to Netze BW the use of the Cost Malmquist, drawing extensively from research in \( **R1**\), and Tornqvist productivity indices \( **R3\)**. This advice was then included in Netze BW’s submission to BNetzA. BNetzA subsequently commissioned its own consultant \(WIK\) to review the energy companies’ submissions. WIK \( **S2**\), quoting Polynomics, found both the Cost Malmquist and the Tornqvist indices appropriate  methodologies for calculating the Xgen. BNetzA then officially adopted them \( **S1**\) and opened the process to final consultation.Bundesverband der Energie und Wasserwirtschaft \(BDEW\), an industry association which represents over 1,800 German energy and water companies, responded by commissioning a consultancy company \(Oxera\) to review BNetzA’s final methodology. Oxera commissioned Thanassoulis and Giraleas as “renowned” \(an official term in German law\) academic experts, to advise BDEW on its response \( **S4**\) and they did so by drawing on their underpinning research \( **R1, R3**\). The impact is the adoption and subsequent implementation of the Cost Malmquist \(pioneered in **R1**\) and Törnqvist productivity \( **R3**\) indices by BNetzA \( **S1**\) for calculating Xgen for the regulatory cycles spanning 2017\-2023. **2. Computing revenue caps for regulated TSOs in the Netherlands**This impact relates to development of the methodology \( **R3**\) used to calculate productivity change estimates and its subsequent implementation by Dutch TSOs to determine their revenue caps. In 2015, the Dutch energy regulator, the Authority for Consumers and Markets of the Netherlands \(ACM\), commissioned the consultancy Oxera to update the methodology used to calculate industry\-specific productivity change, and produce estimates for the 2017\-2021 regulatory period. Giraleas, as the academic lead of the project \( **S7**\), drew on regulatory precedent and the underpinning research \( **R3**\) to together with the Oxera team update and substantially change the methodology used to generate the required estimates of productivity change \( **S5**\).ACM then invited TSOs to comment. Giraleas and the Oxera team analysed the TSOs’ responses, and stood by their original findings \( **S6**\). The impact is the development of the methodology and the production of the estimates, which ultimately were adopted by the regulator. This impacted the regulation of energy prices paid by 17M people over 5 years. **3. Impact on the revenue cap for German TSO Netze BW** The beneficiary of this impact – which draws on research by Thanassoulis \( **R1,** **R2**, **R4** ch 3\-5\) and \( **R5**, sections R6, R8\) – is Netze BW, the largest TSO in the German state of Baden\-Württemberg. It serves 2.32 million electricity and 147,000 gas customers. Thanassoulis, as academic expert, authored with a team from the consultancy Oxera two court submissions by Netze BW. These submissions appealed respectively the regulator BNetzA’s determinations of the Xind \(firm specific efficiency target\) and Xgen \(industry productivity target\) factors relating to the 2014\-2018 \(Xind\) and 2018\-2022 \(Xgen\) regulatory cycles \( **S7**\). It was argued that the methods used by the regulator for computing Xind and Xgen above was not in line with scientific best practice to the detriment of Netze BW. 

 The Xind case was submitted to Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf \(Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf\) and settled out of court in 2017, resulting in a substantial financial benefit for Netze BW in terms of the revenue it would be permitted to raise within the regulatory framework. The Xgen appeal has been submitted for hearing. At the time of writing an outcome is still awaited. The combined financial impact for Netze BW of the two cases relates to in\-scope expenditure of over €600 million across the five\-year regulatory cycle. 

 The impact on the methodology and its implementation for computing the scope of productivity and efficiency gains in Germany and The Netherlands is set to have an enduring effect on regulatory policy and practice beyond Germany and the Netherlands. A 2018 study commissioned by the Council of European Energy Regulators to develop a methodology for cross\-European performance assessment of TSOs is based upon the methodology adopted by the German regulator \( **S8**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 **Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis \(IPA\)** is a qualitative methodology for describing and understanding how individuals make sense of their personal experience that was originated by Jonathan Smith in the 1990s. In his work at Birkbeck since 2000, Smith has developed and applied the IPA methodology, and has established IPA as one of the most popular and influential methods for basic and applied qualitative psychological research. This case study documents the exceptional impact of IPA since 2014. IPA is taught widely across the UK, including in professional training, and is the method of choice for thousands of doctoral theses worldwide. It has affected applied clinical and health\-related research and practice, and has recently become an important tool for commercial consultancy and service development in healthcare and other industries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Jonathan A. Smith introduced Interpretative \(or Interpretive\) Phenomenological Analysis \(IPA\) in the 1990s as a new methodology for qualitative research and investigation in psychology and related disciplines, and in applied clinical and social contexts \(as reviewed in \[1\]\). Since joining Birkbeck in 1999, he has developed the conceptual and methodological basis of IPA, has applied this method in numerous empirical studies, primarily in health\-related contexts, and has established IPA as one of the most widely used tools for qualitative psychological research world\-wide. He is the lead author on the seminal book on IPA \[2\], published in 2009. This book is the definitive guide to the approach, offering theoretical background, methodological guidance, samples of original research and an account of important issues. In February 2020, the book was ranked 6th in Psychological Research on Amazon, and 9th in Social Science Methodology. Smith’s personal citation record is also exceptionally high \(more than 34,000 Google Scholar citations since 2015\); the vast majority of which are to his work developing and utilising IPA. In July 2020, Smith was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the British Psychological Society in recognition of his pioneering role in establishing and enhancing the place of qualitative research in psychology. 

 IPA explores in detail participants’ personal lived experience and how participants make sense of that personal experience. It is an explicitly interpretative endeavour where the researcher aims to make sense of an individual’s own interpretation of their experiences. IPA offers a systematic and rigorous set of procedures for conducting this research. IPA has an idiographic commitment to the detailed analysis of each case in its own right, before a move to examine convergence and divergence across cases. The combination of this set of distinctive characteristics enables IPA to provide rich, compelling, nuanced and evidenced accounts of individual lived experience. 

 In addition to providing the definitive guide to IPA in 2009 \[2\], Smith has published numerous influential articles refining the theoretical and methodological framework of IPA. His highly cited review of the development of IPA provides a specific focus on its critical features \(e.g. idiographic commitment\), and describes the different levels of analysis offered by this approach \[1\]. In another highly cited article \[3\], he presented explicit criteria for evaluating the quality of IPA publications. He has also published numerous research articles where IPA was applied to understand human experience in various health and social settings, particularly in relation to the experience of pain and suffering. For example, he employed the IPA methodology to identify the complexities of understanding genetic risk in individuals considering taking genetic tests for Huntington’s Disease \[4\], to examine the psychologically debilitating impact of chronic benign back pain \[5\]; or to uncover links between alcohol consumption and concepts of masculinity in young men \[6\]. Smith has also collaborated with many other health psychologists in research projects investigating different aspects of health and disease that were funded by NIHR, the NHS, and the Department of Health, among others \[a\]. 

 During the current assessment period, IPA has grown hugely in popularity, and is now one of the best\-known qualitative approaches in psychology and the social sciences. From 2014 to 2019, Scopus shows 13,174 articles referring to IPA in the title or abstract. It is not only employed widely by academic researchers, but increasingly also in applied clinical and commercial settings. This case study demonstrates the exceptional impact of the IPA methodology during the assessment period, both within and outside academia.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This case study documents the substantial and wide impacts of IPA, as developed by Smith at Birkbeck, during the assessment period. It presents quantitative evidence to show how IPA affected teaching, research, and professional training within academia, and to demonstrate the ever growing influence of IPA in applied contexts, such as its importance for clinical and health\-related practice, and its emerging role within commercial consultancy. 

 **Impact of IPA on Teaching, Doctoral and Professional Training** 

 IPA is taught by many UK higher education institutions offering BPS\-accredited programmes in psychology at undergraduate and/or postgraduate levels, including the delivery of doctorates and accredited postgraduate degrees. IPA is employed in research on best practice in medical training at UCL, one of the UK’s largest medical schools \[Aii\]. IPA has also been widely used in doctoral research both within psychology and in other subject areas such as: management studies, social work, education and gender studies. It was referred to in the title or abstract of 1,389 UK doctoral dissertations between 2014 and 2019 \[Aiii\]. The ProQuest Theses & A.I. Database \(the largest global database of theses\) lists 2,264 doctoral theses submitted worldwide between 2014 and 2019 that refer to IPA in the title or abstract \[Aiii\]. Of these, 1,068 were conducted in the US. For example, there were 230 doctoral theses at Northeastern University and 86 theses at the Wright Institute \(a professional clinical psychology centre in Berkeley\) which explicitly refer to IPA \[Aiii\]. 

 IPA training workshops for PhD students, professional doctoral students, researchers, academics, and clinicians are regularly provided by Smith himself and by experienced IPA teachers and practitioners. They are coordinated across the 60 active national and regional IPA networks, with the central IPA website at Birkbeck as a hub \[Aiv\]. Smith ran 15 invited national and international IPA keynotes and/or workshops between 2014 and 2020 in, for example: Florida, Athens, Stockholm, Poitiers \(total attendance: approximately 1,000\) \[Av\]. Other UK\-based training events since 2014 include five workshops provided by the National Centre for Research Methods, regular IPA workshops run at Glasgow Caledonian University and \(in Ireland\) workshops at Dublin City University. IPA has also been used to develop professional training within the NHS. 

 **Applied Clinical and Health Research** 

 IPA has become an important tool for clinical and health research aimed at understanding patient experience to improve patient\-centred service provision. The guidance on research methodology provided by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust \(a pioneer in mental health services\) includes an entire section on IPA, which refers to Smith’s 2009 book and other publications by him and his group \[Bi\]. The National Institute for Health Research \(the UK’s largest health research funder\) lists 7 projects using IPA \(1 live, 6 completed\) within the assessment period \(total funding: >£6m\) \[Bii\]. The North East London NHS Foundation Trust currently sponsors a large IPA\-based psychotherapy study on the lived experience of anorexia sufferers \[Biii\]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) lists 184 pieces of research and guidance which use or cite IPA in its online evidence database for practitioners, including 23 evidence summaries provided by government and third sector organisations, such as the Institution for Research and Innovation in Social Services, Centre for Policy on Ageing, Race Equality Foundation, and the Office of the Children’s Commissioner \[Biv\]. IPA is recommended as a research method in the current NICE Clinical Guidance on Self Harm \[Bv\]. The NHS Health Research Authority website includes 315 research summaries produced from 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2020 that use or cite IPA, covering topics as diverse as mothers’ experiences of breastfeeding in public, head injury, and depression \[Bvi\]. 

 **Consultancy and Commercial Applications of IPA** 

 IPA has recently become an important tool for client\-centred consultancy, where it is used to improve understanding of customer and patient experience, and to inform the development of products and services in healthcare, retail, and in financial and pharmaceutical industries. 

 *FutureCurve* is a business consultancy that uses IPA to identify customer needs for their clients. \[Ci\]. *Customer Faithful* is a research consultancy that uses their IPA\-based Lifelines<sup>TM</sup> approach as their main method for projects with clients including the NHS, Crabtree and Evelyn, Pfizer, Argos, QVC, Ingeus and DLA Piper \[Ciii\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 A collaborative research project led by West investigating the structural and cultural factors that threaten the safety and quality of care throughout the NHS has underpinned systemic impact within the healthcare systems throughout the UK. The research has been a catalyst for the transformation of leadership and cultures across the sector, becoming central to policy embedded in national strategies such as: ‘Developing People, Improving Care’ \(2016\) and ‘We Are the NHS: The People Plan for 2020/2021’. The partnership between West and NHS England and NHS Improvement has supported NHS Trusts in England through a programme to develop leadership and cultures that deliver high\-quality, compassionate patient care, reaching half a million clinical and managerial staff. Similar approaches have been developed in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. West was appointed a CBE in the Queen’s 2020 Birthday Honours List for services to compassion and innovation in the NHS.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Following allegations of serious care failures and avoidable patient deaths in Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, the Francis Inquiry revealed that between January 2005 and March 2009, up to 1,200 patients died as a result of poor care at Stafford Hospital, a district general hospital in Staffordshire, England. As a result of this inquiry, the Department of Health commissioned research to determine the extent to which cultures of high\-quality care existed across the NHS. 

 This research was led by West of Lancaster University Management School \(LUMS\) and involved a team of 30 interdisciplinary researchers in psychology, anthropology, policy studies and statistics. The other key members of the team and their universities were Dawson \(Sheffield\), Baker, Dixon\-Woods, Martin \(Leicester\), McKee \(Aberdeen\), Lilford \(Birmingham\), and Wilkie \(National Association for Patient Participation\). The large, mixed\-method research programme was carried out between 2010 and 2013, with the bulk of the research activity taking place after West joined LUMS in April 2011 from Aston University. The programme incorporated 300 interviews with senior level executives, managers, and frontline staff; numerous patient, carer and team surveys; hundreds of sets of board minutes and published datasets on performance across all NHS trust types \(hospital, mental health, and ambulance\); and cultural \(ethnographic\) case studies \(of hospital wards, primary care practices, and emergency care departments\), totalling 650 hours of observation. In addition, 10 years’ data from the NHS National Staff Survey from >250,000 respondents annually were analysed. The underpinning research revealed many ‘bright spots’ of excellent care, practice, and innovation across the NHS in England \[R1, R2\]. However, it also indicated ‘dark spots’ of poor care, including harried, distracted staff and evidence of deficient leadership, which constituted structural and cultural factors that threatened the quality and safety of care. Among the ‘dark spots’ were cultures and leadership that were characterised by one or more of the following: 

1.  unclear/disjointed goals in NHS organisations, leading to ‘priority thickets’ that consumed resources yet provided little coherent strategy; 

1.  excessive box\-ticking to comply with external requirements; 

1.  multiple regulatory bodies and external agencies serving different but overlapping functions, leading to ambiguity, fragmentation, and competing pressures; 

1.  poor intelligence on which to base decisions and improvements; 

1.  highly variable staff support and a lack of respect and appreciation; 

1.  ‘comfort\-seeking’ behaviours that focused on making a good external impression and positioned staff who raised concerns as trouble\-makers; 

1.  a lack of integration of work processes, leading to time\-wasting, frustrating barriers, and gaps in care; and 

1.  indiscriminate use of quality improvement management techniques and ‘magical thinking’ that isolated initiatives would solve many problems quickly and easily \[R1, R2\]. 

 The recommendations for developing cultures of high\-quality care and patient safety based on the research included the following: 

1.  clear national and local\-level leadership providing direction focused on quality and safety \[R1, R2\]; 

1.  compassionate and collective leadership at all levels \[R3, R4, R5\]; 

1.  leadership that promotes staff wellbeing and engagement \(the key factor in organisations with high\-quality care, good financial performance and high patient satisfaction \[R3, R4, R5, R6\]; 

1.  an emphasis on the patient perspective \[R1\]; 

1.  senior staff nurturing cultures that ensure that front\-line innovation can flourish an 

 that work pressures do not crowd out space for quality improvement \[R1, R3, R4, R5\]; 

1.  NHS staff working in supportive, well\-structured teams \[R1, R4\]; 

1.  better communication within and between teams and encouragement of teams to regularly take time out to review their performance \[R1, R4\]; and avoidance of burdensome systems for data collection as well as a culture of using data simply for ‘comfort\-seeking’ \[R1, R2\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 West has persistently led efforts to ensure the dissemination of the findings and implementation of the recommendations of the research programme, giving >300 presentations to national NHS bodies and to practitioners \(including doctors, nurses, allied health professionals\) in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and individual NHS organisations throughout the UK between 2014 and 2020 \[S1, S10\(b\)\]. This engaged approach has produced a wide variety of impacts within a range of healthcare beneficiaries; from government and NHS policy makers, practitioner and service impacts, through to patient experience. These NHS bodies and practitioners are the primary beneficiaries of the research, and the key areas of impact are described in this section. 

##  1 Shaping a national strategy for cultures of high\-quality care and compassionate leadership in England 

 The research led by West \[R1, R2, R3, R5\] shaped the first NHS national improvement and leadership development strategy:  [Developing People, Improving Care, 2016](https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/developing-people-improving-care/). This strategy is being implemented across the NHS in England, is sponsored by all the national bodies overseeing the NHS, and constitutes a national framework to ‘guide action on improvement skill building, leadership development, and talent management’ across all NHS organisations and roles. West’s research outputs \(including R1, R3, R4\) were cited 10 times in the Culture and Team\-working section of the strategy, representing more than a third of the total citations used in this section \[S2\(a\)\]. West’s research \[R1 – R4\] has been used to inform assessments of NHS organisations in 2019 and 2020 in relation to the key elements of the *Developing People, Improving Care, 2016* strategy as part of the  [NHS England/Improvement Performance Oversight Framework](https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/nhs-oversight-framework-201920/). This framework is used to monitor the performance of all NHS provider organisations and to tailor support to their needs. The research was also used to inform the We are the NHS: People Plan for 2020/2021 \[S2\(b\)\], published in August 2020, which focuses on developing leadership, cultures and conditions to ensure that staff are being supported and retained and that the NHS is a ‘Best Place to Work’. In 2020, West was commissioned by NHSE Improvement to design the measures that will be used to evaluate the implementation of the plan. 

 As a testament to the impact of the research, the previous NHS Workforce Director General and Director of the NHS Leadership Academy and the lead of the *We are the NHS: People Plan for 2020/2021* commented, *“As an NHS Chief Executive, I have tried to put into practice the processes, interventions and culture that his \[West’s\] work espouses. This has resulted in significant and award\-winning success in quality improvement, organisational performance and staff and patient satisfaction. \(…\) No individual has had a higher impact in this field than Professor West and where his work is turned into practice, it has huge impact on tens of thousands of NHS Staff and on millions of patients”* \[S2\(c\)\]. 

 West’s research \[R6\] has also been used to develop the NHS ‘ [Compassionate leadership in crisis](https://people.nhs.uk/guides/compassionate-leadership-in-crisis/)’ online guide designed for use during the Covid19 Crisis. In 2020, West was appointed a CBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List for services to compassion and innovation in the NHS. 

##  2 Informing national strategies on cultures of high\-quality care and compassionate leadership in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales 

 A comparable approach to shaping national strategy to that in England has been developed in Northern Ireland and has been informed by West’s research \[R1, R2, R3, R6\], culminating in the 2017 launch of the Health and Social Care \(HSC\) Collective Leadership Strategy:  [Health and Wellbeing 2026: Delivering Together](https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/hsc-collective-leadership-strategy). The Director of HR & Corporate Affairs, South Eastern HSC, noted, “ *Professor Michael West’s research and papers into collective leadership & culture were used as the cornerstone to the development of the Collective Leadership strategy for health and social care in Northern Ireland”* \[S3\]. 

 West’s work \[R1, R2, R6\] was a key influence in the development of  [Project Lift,](https://projectlift.scot/about/) a whole\-system approach to enhancing leadership capability and capacity in health and care in Scotland \[S4\(a,b\)\]. The Head of Leadership and Talent Management of the Scottish Government Health Workforce said that West’s work *“has been instrumental and a founding piece of evidence for our new approach to Leadership and Talent Management across Health and Care in Scotland”. \(…\) As such, ’kindness and compassion’ are one of our fundamental descriptors, that run through our approach to Values Based Recruitment, Talent Management, Leadership Development, and Performance Appraisal”* \[S4\(b\)\]. 

 In addition, West is working with Health Education and Improvement Wales to apply the research findings which has led to the implementation of a 10\-year culture and  [compassionate leadership](https://nhswalesleadershipportal.heiw.wales/compassionate-leadership) strategy across the country. The Director of Workforce and OD, Deputy CEO, Health Education and Improvement Wales, said, *“Professor West is playing a pivotal role in influencing the development of the health and social care leadership strategy, which is aimed at driving a consistent approach to compassionate leadership”* \[S5\]. 

##  3 Implementing a culture and leadership programme for the NHS across the UK and healthcare systems internationally 

 Drawing directly on West’s research \[R1, R5\] \[S6\(a\)\] and working in close collaboration with West and The King’s Fund, NHS Improvement \(the NHS regulatory body for England\), committed in 2015 to building an  [open\-source support programme](https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/culture-leadership/) for healthcare organisations. NHS Improvement has invested approximately GBP1 million to develop the tools which enable organisations to assess their existing cultures and leadership and design and implement strategies to ensure cultures of high\-quality care \[S6\(b\)\]. Based entirely on the key elements for compassionate cultures and leadership identified by the research \[R1\-R6\], between 2015 and 2020, the programme has been implemented by >80 NHS trusts in England as well as NHS organisations in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland \[S6\(c\)\]. An evaluation by independent researchers led by a Professor of Health Management at the University of Manchester described the programme as “ *positive, constructive and purposeful in supporting NHS trusts to develop a compassionate and inclusive culture*.” \[S6\(d\)\]. The former Executive Director of Improvement at NHS Improvement also commented that as a result of West’s research and presentations to NHS national bodies and individual trusts, *“all leadership teams are being asked to review their people development strategies and revise priorities and budgets to target building these capabilities for their organisations in the areas identified by the framework… Professor West’s work has been central to providing the evidence base and approaches \(tools\) to support the changes required for provider organisations across the NHS to develop cultures of high quality, compassionate and continually improving care”* \[S6\(b\)\]. 

 The culture programme was a guiding framework used in service transformation following a merger in 2019 which created Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. The Group Director of Organisation Design and Development at the trust confirmed that measurable benefits have been achieved such as: reduced variation in lithotripsy service; quicker access to urgent gynaecological surgery and increasing access to rehabilitation services for fractured neck and femur; reduced reliance on agency and locum staff; and improved health and wellbeing of staff. In relation to the culture programme, she said that it: “ *provided a robust framework for understanding, describing and strengthening the leadership and culture of our new organisation.*” \[S7\(a\)\]. West’s research has also provided the basis for leadership programmes developed at the recently merged Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Based on a competency framework that applies to all staff, between 2019 and 2020 these programmes have been delivered to approximately 240 senior and operational managers, with highly positive evaluation of impacts at individual, team and organisational levels. Participant feedback indicated benefits such as time and money saved through improved working relationships, improved turnaround times in A&E, and improved patient care \[S7\(b\)\]. 

 The research has also directly informed practice in other healthcare systems around the world. In Australia, since 2014, West has assisted the Ministries of Health of Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, presenting his research and recommendations to >1,000 health leaders, including CEOs, clinical senates, board members, regulatory bodies such as the NSW Clinical Excellence Commission and Safer Care Victoria \[S8\]. A member of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Melbourne commented, *“Professor West’s work has been embedded in several State and National leadership programs and will continue to inspire Australian health leaders, at all levels, to develop a culture of high\-quality compassionate care.”* \[S8\]. In Ireland, the Programme Director of the Institute of Leadership, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, University of Medicine and Health Sciences reported that West’s research “.. *.underpins all of our academic and leadership programmes in Ireland, Bahrain and Dubai and our Health Service Executive \(H.S.E.\) National Leadership programmes for over 100 clinical directors and other senior healthcare leaders to support and nurture cultures of high\-quality compassionate care”* \[S9\]. 

##  4 Leading General Medical Council \(GMC\) review of the wellbeing of UK doctors and King’s Fund/RCN Foundation review of the wellbeing of UK nurses and midwives 

 West was asked to co\-chair, with Denise Coia, a review for the GMC \( [Caring for doctors, Caring for patients](https://www.gmc-uk.org/-/media/documents/caring-for-doctors-caring-for-patients_pdf-80706341.pdf) *,* between February 2018 and November 2019\) examining the mental health of the 300,000 doctors and 50,000 medical students across the UK, with a focus on the cultures of the organisations where they work \[R1, R2, R4, R5\]. The review has led to extensive recommendations to initiate changes to doctors’ working contexts \(increasing doctors’ influence and control; improving their work conditions, such as by incorporating rest and rotas; improving teamwork; promoting compassionate leadership and cultures; and addressing workload\) that are now being implemented by all the national bodies overseeing the work of doctors. An action group is coordinating the implementation of the changes with other national bodies across the UK \[S10\(a\)\]. West also led an inquiry by The King’s Fund \(‘ [The courage of compassion](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/courage-compassion-supporting-nurses-midwives)’, between April 2020 and September 2020\) commissioned by the Royal College of Nursing Foundation into the mental health of the 700,000 nurses and midwives across the UK, with a focus on compassionate leadership and cultures \[R1\-R6\]. In the four weeks after the launch in September 2020 the report was downloaded 2,596 times, and was covered in national print and broadcast media as well as specialist press. It received positive feedback from key individuals \(e.g. Chief Nursing Officers, Chief Midwifery Officers\) who found it useful to help change practice, and from stakeholder organisations \(e.g.  [Nursing & Midwifery Council](https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/nmc-comments-on-the-kings-fund-report-the-courage-of-compassion-supporting-nurses-and-midwives-to-deliver-high-quality-care/),  [NHS Employers](https://www.nhsemployers.org/media-centre/2020/09/we-can-always-do-more-to-support-staff-wellbeing-says-nhs-employers-in-response-to-kings-fund-report)\) who welcomed the recommendations \[S10\(b\)\]. Following the report’s publication, the Health and Social Care committee in the House of Commons called West to give oral evidence on workforce burnout and resilience in the NHS and social care in October 2020 \[S10\(c\)\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study shows how University of Southampton research into medieval places, identities and stories has re\-made and re\-animated lost historic landscapes for diverse user communities today, bringing significant social, cultural and economic benefits across the England\-Wales border region and beyond. The research team have worked with a wide range of stakeholders and agencies, as well as commercial partners, to develop new approaches to heritage interpretation, heritage\-based urban regeneration, new arts and tourism ventures, and regional tourism capacity\-building. By reconstructing a forgotten medieval pilgrimage route, this research boosted tourism in the region, fostered wide engagement with local history via an interactive digital map and created new business opportunities; it also transformed an artist’s practice in ways that continued to shape public understanding of pilgrimage at London’s Southwark Cathedral during the Year of Cathedrals and Pilgrimage \(2020\). The innovative engagement strategies developed through the research have received international recognition, and the projects have been cited as a model of the public benefits of research in policy documents for the UK government. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 How can new research recover, analyse and re\-make historic medieval landscapes? How can lost or invisible historic environments and cultural geographies be made visible and re\-animated for modern communities? And what kinds of value can medieval stories about place and belief offer for place\-making strategies today? 

 Clarke was PI on the AHRC\-funded research project ‘City Witness: Place and Perspective in Medieval Swansea’, based at Southampton \(2013\-14\), which used innovative methodologies to explore space, spatial representation and spatial practices in medieval Swansea, using these insights to extend our broader understanding of medieval space, identity and culture, with particular attention to urban environments and border regions. 

 This research was developed in response to a request from the City and County of Swansea \(local government\) for support with a new heritage\-driven strategy to support urban regeneration. A thriving port, a marcher base for the lords of Gower, and a multi\-cultural urban community, Swansea was an important centre in the Middle Ages, comparable with many other historic European towns. Yet the medieval legacy of Swansea is almost invisible today. Wartime bombing and later re\-development of the city centre have almost completely obscured the traces of the medieval urban layout and its buildings. ‘City Witness’ worked with a unique research resource: a manuscript in the Vatican Library \(MS Vat. Lat. 4015\) containing nine eyewitness accounts of the hanging of the Welsh outlaw William Cragh in Swansea in 1290. Cragh came back to life in what was understood by local people as a miracle of St Thomas of Hereford. The project produced the first full edition and translation of these depositions \(Harriett Webster\), integrating them with a new atlas of Swansea c.1300 and 3D visualisations of witness routes and sightlines \[ **3.1**\]. The GIS mapping work was undertaken at Queen’s University Belfast, led by project Co\-Investigator Keith Lilley. Throughout, the research involved collaboration with partners in Swansea, including the Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological Trust, Swansea Museum, and West Glamorgan Archives. The project significantly advanced scholarly understanding of the lost medieval urban environment of Swansea and developed new insights into medieval spatial practices and imaginaries, as well as innovative and transferable digital tools \[ **3.2**\]. This research was expanded in a special issue of the *Journal of Medieval History*: ‘Power, Identity and Miracles on a Medieval Frontier’ \(later also published as a book\), including articles by Clarke and Webster. The focus of the volume broadened to recover the cultural, political and religious landscape of the medieval March of Wales \(border region\) more widely \[ **3.2**\]. Together, Clarke’s research on modern management of mediaeval land in Swansea \(and Chester\) underpinned her new research monograph \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\]. 

 A further AHRC grant for Follow\-on Funding for Impact and Engagement \(AH/P013600/1\) supported the development of the ‘City Witness’ research into the St Thomas Way: a new heritage route from Swansea to Hereford, inspired by the pilgrimage of William Cragh to the shrine of St Thomas, after his miraculous revival. Based on a central partnership with Hereford Cathedral, the St Thomas Way built on the ‘City Witness’ research to tell the story of the medieval March of Wales – today largely a lost / unknown cultural and imaginative geography, which spans multiple local government areas across both England and Wales – through thirteen key locations, curated walks, and a suite of bespoke, immersive multimedia content for each site. The project also involved a collaboration with an Artist in Residence, leading to a touring exhibition which reflected on themes of place, mapping, pilgrimage and identity; and a partnership with Google, including the loan of a StreetView 360° camera and the development of virtual tour content for Google Maps. Work on the St Thomas Way has itself folded back into new research, including the volume *The St Thomas Way and the Medieval March of Wales: Exploring Place, Heritage, Pilgrimage* \[ **3.5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **1. Public interpretation / Cultural impact** 

 **The ‘City Witness’ website** targeted multiple user constituencies, including local communities and visitors to the city, with multimedia content including maps, reconstruction fly\-through videos and a game, with a total of 135,744 visits by November 2018, and a year\-on\-year increase \[ **5.1**\]. The project also produced a major exhibition at **Swansea Museum** \(summer 2014, approximately 22,000 visitors\), which connected the modern city with its \(largely invisible\) medieval heritage, allowed the Museum to display and interpret medieval collections usually held in storage, and included events for local people \[ **5.4**\]. 

 The AHRC grant for Follow\-on Funding for Impact and Engagement \(AH/P013600/1\) supported the development of the ‘City Witness’ research into the St Thomas Way. **The St Thomas Way heritage tourism route** has transformed public understanding of the medieval March of Wales, and enriched heritage engagement at 13 sites and with multiple local communities along the route. The interactive map had 2,472 unique users from July 2018 – November 2018 and continues to attract visitors \[ **5.1**\]. A day of launch events at Hereford Cathedral on 7 July 2018 included living history, mini\-lectures, family activities and a reception \(attended by approximately 250 people\) for communities and stakeholders along the route. 99 feedback cards were collected, with highlights including visitors having learned about ‘the cultural history of the Marches’, ‘William Cragh’s story and St Thomas’, ‘the relevance of pilgrimage for today’, ‘the medieval period is alive – and palpable’, ‘the hidden gems \[on the route\] are worth finding\!’ \[ **5.6**\]. 

 With funding from the University of Southampton’s Public Engagement with Research Unit, the St Thomas Way included a collaboration with an **Artist in Residence, Michelle Rumney**. Her art exhibition, ‘Re\-Making Maps of the Mind: Medieval and Modern Journeys’, is inspired by the project research, and toured locations along the St Thomas Way and beyond. It draws upon a medieval practice whereby a person who needed help was measured using a piece of string or thread, which was placed inside a candle used in prayer \[ **5.5**\]. Host venues to July 2019 included Hereford Cathedral, Abergavenny Priory, St Mary’s Church Swansea, St Illtud’s Church \(with Heritage Centre\) Llantwit Major, Ewenny Priory, Newport Cathedral, Margam Abbey, Caerphilly Castle, and Lighthouse \(Poole Arts Centre\), with the exhibition viewed by an estimated 1400 people at Poole and Swansea alone \[ **5.5**\]. Public art workshops that engage participants creatively with themes of place, mapping and pilgrimage have been held at several host venues and attended by 149 people. This exhibition helped visitors connect with the past and practices of pilgrimage. The Chancellor of Hereford Cathedral described how ‘powerfully affecting’ it was to see many people wanting to partake in the measuring and leaving reflections at the site. He described it as ‘instructing’ to the cathedral in terms of facilitating ‘meaningful physical engagement’ with the shrine \[ **5.7**\]. 

 An example of how Hereford Cathedral has built on the project includes working with the **Hereford College of Arts** to produce a public exhibition \(‘The Way’, 23 October – 4 November 2019\). Over 200 people \(students\) spent time in the cathedral and visited locations on the St Thomas Way, developing pieces of design, music and performing arts in response to the concept of modern\-day pilgrimage. Darren Williams, Course Leader at Hereford College of Arts, said: ‘This project has enabled our students to engage with a theme they knew very little about beforehand. They have been able to develop their knowledge and appreciation of the subject and discover its benefits in the 21st century, particularly in terms of wellbeing.’ \[ **5.9**\] 

 Through Michelle Romney, the St Thomas Way also partnered with Google, with a special loan of a Google StreetView 360° camera. Michelle produced virtual tours of sites and walking routes on the Way, which are now available in a St Thomas Way feature on **Google Maps**, which received 947,534 visits by July 2020 \[ **5.5**\]. 

 The projects have featured in a wide range of local and national media coverage \(print, online and broadcast\). Both projects have attracted active engagement on social media: The @StThomasWay Twitter account has a steadily growing number of followers \(1035 in December 2020\) including many businesses, community groups and heritage/tourism organisations. Using methodologies developed by the ‘City Witness’ project for recovering and interpreting lost historic environments, Clarke advised IWC Media for the ‘Norman Winchester’ episode \(21<sup>st</sup> April 2018\) of the primetime **Channel 4** series ‘Britain’s Most Historic Towns’. The episode script explained ‘Using Catherine’s research, for the first time in centuries we can reveal what William’s Palace would have looked like’, including a digital visualisation and extended interview. It attracted 1,230,000 viewers, exceeding average ratings for a show in its timeslot \[ **5.2**\]. 

 Through the success of the project led to Clarke’s involvement in the working group chaired by Lord Cormack at the House of Lords, which developed the national ‘Year of English Cathedrals’ strategy/programme for 2020. It included the launch of several walks to rediscover pilgrimage routes. This nationwide celebration is inspired by several significant anniversaries, including the 800th anniversary of the consecration of the pilgrimage shrine of St Thomas Becket. Becket gave his last sermon at Southwark Cathedral before walking to Canterbury. An example of how the St Thomas Way project influenced these commemorations was that Rumney was commissioned to create an installation, based on her measuring practice, in Southwark Cathedral during Lent 2020. Although curtailed by the Covid\-19 crisis, it was visited by 5,100 people in March, and the evening launch accompanied by candlelight and mediaeval chant attracted over 180 people. Thus, the St Thomas Way project has had an enduring effect on both Rumney’s practice and career and the interpretation of pilgrimage heritage \[ **5.10**\]. 

 **2. Place\-making, urban regeneration and local development** 

 The ‘City Witness’ project specifically aimed to use new research to facilitate regeneration and development in **Swansea city centre**: an area disconnected from its medieval heritage since WW2, facing economic and social challenges, and targeted for development through EU Convergence funding. The ‘City Witness’ research project was devised in partnership with the City and County of Swansea as part of their strategy to develop a distinct identity for the city centre as the ‘Castle Quarter’. The project developed a new interactive tour of medieval Swansea, linked to a pavement marker trail \(with match funding from Swansea Council\), drawing visitors into the city centre and advancing the Council’s ‘Castle Quarter’ strategy. Clarke also advised on new interpretation for **Swansea Castle** by a commercial company, helping to promote and realise the potential of the castle ruins as a heritage/tourism asset. After the ‘City Witness’ exhibition launch, Council Cabinet Member for Regeneration, Nick Bradley, told the BBC: ‘The relevance of heritage tourism can't be underestimated. There's a major appetite for it and exhibitions of this type show we're keeping pace with demand here in Swansea’ \[ **5.4**\]. 

 The St Thomas Way touring art exhibition has helped facilitate arts and cultural access local communities along the route between Swansea and Hereford, developing the potential of local churches and heritage sites – often in under\-served rural locations or disadvantaged urban settings – as cultural centres \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **3. Tourism capacity\-building and regional development** 

 The St Thomas Way project aims developed out of tourism opportunities/challenges identified in Swansea and in regional policy/strategy statements across England and Wales, including: the need to embed Swansea more robustly in heritage routes, the aim to develop ‘faith tourism’ and emphasis on ‘sense of place’ \(Visit Wales Cultural Tourism Action Plan, 2012; Wales Faith Tourism Action Plan, 2013\), and to increase overnight stays in the region \(Herefordshire Tourism Strategy\). The St Thomas Way heritage route aimed to release the under\-exploited potential of smaller local sites \(e.g. parish churches and unstaffed heritage sites\) as heritage tourism assets, by linking well\-established tourism destinations \(e.g. Caerphilly Castle or Hereford Cathedral\) with little\-known locations such as Patrishow or Llancarfan, through the story of the medieval March of Wales and William Cragh’s pilgrimage. A feature in the *Daily Telegraph* \(circulation: 363,183\) travel section, ‘Who needs the Camino de Santiago when you can hike through South Wales?’ responded positively to this strategy, commenting that ‘in these small, unspoiled towns along the St Thomas Way you can capture something of the sounds, smells and rhythms of medieval life’ and promoting the route as a visitor attraction \[ **5.2**\]. Organisations across the region have welcomed the Way as a new tourism initiative, with Eat Sleep Live Herefordshire tweeting that ‘this whole route is such a wonderful new attraction for walkers’ \[ **5.1**\]. This enthusiasm has been sustained, with the *Daily Telegraph* and Eat Sleep Live Herefordshire again featuring the St Thomas Way in March 2019 and December 2019 respectively. The **British Pilgrimage Trust** has recognised the route by distributing an initial run of 10,000 brochures at sites along it and creating a page for the St Thomas Way on their site, including GPS exchange format files for all the walking routes \[ **5.1**\]. Through a collaboration with Mumbles Brewery, St Thomas Way ale – labelled with a QR code link to the website, route map, and project information – continues to be sold in outlets along the route, as a further promotional/outreach strategy \[ **5.3**\]. The St Thomas Way was also to play a central role in a major programme of events planned at Hereford Cathedral in 2020, to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the canonisation of St Thomas, offering a multiplier effect. Covid disrupted some of these efforts, but the Cathedral successfully moved an Exhibition on ‘The Two Thomases: **The Lives and Deaths of St Thomas Becket and St Thomas Cantilupe’ \(**27 July 2020 \- 2 January 2021\) **online.** 

 **4. Partnerships and economic impacts** 

 A key commercial partnership delivering significant and wide\-reaching economic impact was with digital learning developer **Make Sense** which produced the ‘City Witness’ online game. Make Sense described the collaboration with the ‘City Witness’ research team as ‘pioneering’, helping them to develop and market ‘Elucidat’, a new proprietary authoring tool. It has been exhibited at international trade fairs, using ‘City Witness’ initially as a proof of concept, and is now a major product and spin\-off business. Elucidat’s website states that 17,300000, people all over the world are already benefiting from learning created with Elucidat’ \(December 2020\) via the company’s work developing e\-learning for large companies and organisations. A collaboration with **Mumbles Brewery** \(a micro\-brewery in Swansea\) has led to a new commercial product for the company: St Thomas Way ale. This new product, together with the network of cross\-regional links offered by the St Thomas Way project, has enabled Mumbles Brewery to reach new stockists far beyond their core market of Swansea and its immediate environs, including the refectory at Hereford Cathedral \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **5. Influence on policy and practice** 

 The ‘City Witness’ project featured as a full\-page case study in the **AHRC** Impact Report 2014\-15 to the Department of Business, Innovation & Skills \[ **5.11**\], contributing to public policy formation on UK research funding. The combined project research, engagement and impact have also received awards including the silver medal for **Public Engagement in the International Digital Humanities Awards** 2014, and was a finalist in the 2016 **National Co\-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement Awards**, modelling best practice between HEI and non\-HEI partners in the delivery of impacts \[ **5.8**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Every year breathlessness directly affects over 75 million people worldwide and over two million in the UK, as well as their families and carers, causing disability and poor quality of life. King’s research created a paradigm shift for this previously neglected and poorly treated symptom, leading to better recognition, assessment, care and management of breathlessness for people, irrespective of their underlying diseases. King’s researchers developed and evaluated treatments and combined them into a self\-management toolkit and new services. These connected previously siloed clinical specialties and equipped health professionals, policy makers, commissioners and hospices to provide timely, proactive and multiprofessional care. These innovations are now recommended in guidance and implemented locally, nationally and across four continents. They have improved the lives, self\-management and care of patients affected by breathlessness, including for those shielding during the COVID\-19 pandemic, and those important to them. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2004, King’s has spearheaded research to understand the effects of breathlessness on people affected by advanced diseases, and to develop and trial affordable, timely treatments, integrated care models and self\-management tools that can be widely implemented. 

 **King’s research found that breathlessness is common across many diseases, increasing towards the end of life, and evaluated ways to assess it.** King’s academics revealed that breathlessness is common across many diseases, affecting over 95% of people with lung diseases, around 80\-90% with heart failure, 50\-80% with cancer; totalling >75 million people worldwide, > 2 million in the UK. King’s researchers evaluated tools to measure breathlessness, aiding assessment in research and clinical care **\(1\)**. They discovered that people with breathlessness and advanced diseases experienced \~13\-14 symptoms, alongside very severe, often fluctuating, breathlessness, which habitually caused longstanding suffering that worsened towards the end of life **\(2,3\)**. 

 **King’s work raised the visibility of breathlessness as a distressing and isolating symptom, of high cost to health and social care services, and to families.** Researchers showed that breathlessness is frightening for patients and caregivers **\(2\)**, with fluctuating severe episodes **\(3\)**. People most affected became too breathless to go out or even speak **\(2\)**. The nature and insidious onset of breathlessness often rendered it invisible to healthcare teams **\(2\)**. The research found that traditional siloed models of heath care did not work for patients with advanced disease and breathlessness, resulting in hospital admissions and high formal and informal care costs. 

 **King’s researchers fostered new multi\-disciplinary collaborations to connect silos, improve treatment and create a paradigm shift.** They set out to create a novel collaborative network, supported through workshops, reports, training fellowships and research. The network connected patients, families, palliative care clinicians, respiratory teams, therapists, physiologists and neurologists. It spanned teams across the UK, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Australia and Italy, Canada, the USA and Australia, including the UK National Cancer Research Institute. This interdisciplinary collaboration kindled fresh perspectives on the multidimensional nature of breathlessness, led to research that extended beyond the lungs to include muscle strength and the brain’s response **\(4\)** and improved outcome measurement **\(1\)**. 

 **King’s research improved responsible prescribing.** King’s academics discovered that, although benzodiazepines were commonly recommended and used to manage breathlessness, there was no evidence that they relieved breathlessness in advanced cancer or lung disease and they could have adverse effects **\(5\)**. 

 **King’s provided evidence for non\-pharmacological therapies as a first step in management.** King’s landmark Cochrane review revealed that inexpensive non\-pharmacological interventions that could be used at home were effective, or showed promise, in improving mobility, self\-care and reducing the impact of breathlessness in advanced diseases **\(4\)**. These included: walking aids; breathing retraining; hand\-held fans and neuromuscular electrical stimulation \(NMES\). 

 **King’s researchers developed and trialled novel toolkits and breathlessness services.** They amalgamated their findings of effective therapies into novel self\-management toolkits and integrated short\-term Breathlessness Services \(BSs\). These built on earlier studies and collaborations, especially between Higginson and Booth, who together developed and trialled BSs in London and Cambridge. The BSs incorporated respiratory medicine, palliative care, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work. Patient home toolkits were provided at the first BSs assessment. BSs healthcare workers usually provided around three follow\-up contacts, locally adapted to urban/mixed environments, to review patient and family concerns and care. The Breathlessness Services \(BSs\) randomised trial led by Higginson found that BSs improved quality of life and survival for people with lung diseases and cancer at no additional costs to the NHS **\(6\)**. Similar cost\-effectiveness was found in Cambridge \(Booth senior author, co\-authors Higginson, McCrone, King’s\), and in interstitial lung disease \(Bajwah\). These were developed and tested using the MRC guidance on evaluating complex interventions, with fast\-track mixed\-method randomised trial and outcome measures pioneered by King’s researchers. 

 **King’s collated definitive evidence on breathlessness services \(BSs\) \(7\).** King’s led an NIHR evidence synthesis with meta\-analysis and research consultation, combining all studies of BSs to determine the extent of international evidence of effectiveness and key service ingredients. The effectiveness of a BS \(usually fewer than six contacts, face to face or phone\) on psychological symptoms in advanced disease was similar to an 11\-week programme of psychological therapy.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Prior to King’s research, breathlessness was poorly understood or quantified, with a lack of effective therapies once efforts to manage the underlying diseases were exhausted. Health professionals, patients, and those important to them, struggled with few evidence\-based treatments, interventions or targeted services. This resulted in high distress, poor quality of life and invisibility for those affected, as well as strains on health and social care. King’s\-led and collaborative research has: 

 **Generated a paradigm shift from breathlessness considered as a neglected and often invisible symptom, to a widely recognised symptom and syndrome.** Breathlessness is now widely recognised in multiple advanced diseases and is better detected, assessed and treated. King’s research is described in independent appraisal as ‘catalysing a whole movement of taking breathlessness seriously and looking at it systematically’ **\[A\]**. The field moved so much that by 2017 some clinicians argued that failure to manage breathlessness in advanced diseases was a ‘breach of human rights’, and an international Delphi exercise proposed ‘chronic breathlessness’ become a clinical syndrome. A major collaborative European Project \(Better B\) was launched in 2019 to connect respiratory, palliative and rehabilitative care with patient led groups and to disseminate and advance better breathlessness practice **\[B\]**. 

 **Equipped health professionals to better recognise, assess and manage breathlessness with person\-centred approaches and treatments, irrespective of underlying pathology.** King’s approaches, treatments and services are now recommended in multiple generalist and specialist textbooks, including in nursing, palliative care, geriatric, respiratory, primary care, physiotherapy and pharmacy. This transformation is evidenced by the growth in references to King’s research and by the expanded content in textbooks on breathlessness assessment and management, especially non\-pharmacological. For example, the Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine tripled its content on breathlessness between the 2011 \(2<sup>nd</sup>\) and 2015 \(3<sup>rd</sup>\) editions. In 2011, breathlessness \(dyspnoea\) had 18 pages with scant mention of non\-pharmacological therapies and recommending benzodiazepines in acute severe breathlessness. In 2015 it devoted >55 pages to breathlessness management, recommending non\-pharmacological treatments as first line, plus new sections on assessment, highlighting >15 King’s research outputs. The 2014 edition of the Palliative Care Formulary, the unrivalled international source of guidance on medicines for pharmacists and clinicians caring for patients facing progressive life\-limiting diseases, concluded that benzodiazepines do not relieve breathlessness per se, quoting King’s research **\[B\]**. Now that healthcare staff have interventions to offer, they have become less anxious and strained at being unable to help patients suffering severe breathlessness. This nurtures staff wellbeing and job satisfaction **\[A\]**. 

 In 2016, the European Research Society’s monograph on Palliative Care in Respiratory Disease had six chapters dedicated to breathlessness, and multiple others, referencing King’s research. This monograph placed non\-pharmacological treatment before pharmacological treatment, quoted King’s research, advocated that benzodiazepines should not be first line treatment and recommended Breathlessness Services \(BSs\) **\[B\]**. The independent report on the impact of King’s research on breathlessness **\[A\]** identified additional opportunities to reach respiratory and primary care clinicians. In response, King’s researchers hosted exhibition stands on breathlessness management, gave talks at the European Respiratory Society Conference, and engaged with the Primary Care Respiratory Society and the European Lung Foundation \(2019\). In 2019, King’s Health Partners developed a new clinical e\-learning programme, called ‘E\-Breathe’, on breathlessness management and BSs with > 3000 logged users by mid\-2020 globally **\[B\]**. 

 **Transformed public perceptions of breathlessness.** King’s research has featured in multiple media, TV, radio, and newspapers, often co\-featuring patients alongside nurses, allied health professionals and doctors. They created a breathlessness specific public and patient involvement and engagement group, supported by the NIHR Applied Research Collaborative and charitable donors, to inform research and spearheaded local and national engagement. King’s hosted public events, e.g. in King’s Science Gallery London in 2019 with >260 visitors, exploring how people were affected by listening to different types of breathlessness. These provided a crucial step change in overcoming the invisibility associated with breathlessness, and the nihilism that nothing could be done **\[C\]**. 

 **Helped policy makers and the commissioning of quality services for better care.** The introduction of King’s research into clinical guidelines and policy documents was an important step to improve equity, access, efficiency and clinical practice in breathlessness support; alerting commissioners and clinicians to cost\-effective therapies and models of care. King’s breathlessness research underpins recommendations across international, national \(UK and beyond\), and local guidelines, including the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease \(GOLD, 2018 and 2020\), European Society for Medical Oncology \(ESMO 2015 and 2020\), National Institute for Clinical Excellence \(NICE, 2018\), and American Society for Clinical Oncology \(ASCO, 2016\) guidelines **\[D\]**. 

 **Better care through widened access to relevant non\-pharmacological therapies**. King’s research widened access to therapeutic approaches tailored to advanced diseases. It integrated Allied Health Professionals into BSs with non\-pharmacological treatments, such as mobility aids and breathing retraining, as a first step **\[A, E\]**. Patients highly valued these components: “giving you tips on how to do things \(referring to home visit from physiotherapist\), you know…they’re logged in the memory bank, but I remember them as I do them, it’s become automatic” **\[H\]**. They are especially useful for patients whose breathlessness restricts them to the home and who cannot reach outpatient rehabilitation services. 

 **Benefited voluntary hospices, palliative care services and their leaders.** A 2015 Hospice UK report highlighted King’s research. This, and wider King’s evidence on therapeutic approaches and BSs, has led voluntary hospices and other palliative care services in the UK and internationally to change from traditional day\-care services, without physical therapies, to proactive rehabilitative approaches with outpatient services targeting symptom self\-management and physical function, especially symptom\-based BSs **\[F\]**. For example, St Christopher’s Hospice teams have adopted and adapted King’s research and BSs for their users over the last 5\-10 years. Their 2019 survey revealed that over two thirds of their patients found breathlessness improved with these interventions **\[F\]**. In addition, the European Association for Palliative Care highlights multiple benefits of King’s breathlessness research at conferences and via their social media to inform and guide their national member associations from Australia, New Zealand, 33 European countries, and individual members from over 50 countries **\[F\]**. 

 **Timely access to breathlessness services \(BSs\) becoming the care standard.** The 2015 independent NIHR dissemination report ‘Better Endings’ highlighted King’s BSs as a means to improve timely access to better multiprofessional care **\[G\]**. There is expanding implementation of BSs internationally, following dissemination from early adopters and King’s trained clinicians and collaborators **\[A, G\]**. Health professionals say: “It’s now hard not to do this” **\[A\]**. Underpinned by King’s collaborative research, BSs have developed internationally including: Early Integrated Palliative Home Care for end\-stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients in Belgium; The Munich Breathlessness Service in Germany; The Advanced Lung Disease Service in Australia, and others in Singapore and Africa **\[A\]**. A 2020 national mapping exercise among Australian and New Zealand palliative care services found that 22% of respondents had integrated respiratory and palliative care BSs. Of those without BSs, 78% expressed interest in their establishment **\[G\]**. 

 **Improved the quality of life, dignity and empowerment of people living with severe breathlessness.** The person\-centred approaches to breathlessness management, including self\-management toolkits and BSs, trialled in King’s research, have improved the lives, dignity and care of patients across the globe. Patients have verified this in interviews, surveys, letters, audits and videos, explaining how they felt transformed; from feeling “worthless” and that they “might as well die”, to being able to cope, and “‘having a new perspective on myself” \(video, 2015\) **\[H\]**. They have been able to resume social activities, with one patient stating: “I’ve gone back to my choir last Friday, first time in six months… and it was fantastic” **\[H\]**. 

 Patients value the individually tailored information that BSs has provided, empowering them to understand and manage their own breathlessness: “I was thrilled to bits to be able to be getting some knowledge of what my complaint was all about… that they’re doing something. The knowledge gained is described as having ‘greatly improved the symptom, and in so doing been transformative in my life” \(patient testimonials and surveys\) **\[H\]**. 

 They commented on staff expertise in person\-centred care, improving respect and dignity and new\-found self\-management skills: “I would get into a panic when I was breathless, but now I can sit down, use my fan, wet my face, read my laminate \(breathlessness poem, part of the toolkit\) and I calm down” and “I was in a very bad state before I came \(to the service\). I was thinking that I was about to be dying. .. but now I know…can handle this *”* **\[H\]**. Audits and surveys have found similar positive accounts by patients about BSs **\[A, H\]**. For example, in an audit of the BS launched in Australia, based on King’s research, patients said it increased their confidence \(87/88, 99%\) and helped them to self\-manage their breathlessness \(84/88, 96%\) **\[H\]**. 

 **Improved the lives of families, carers and others close to them.** Breathlessness is distressing for those close to patients. Family and carers were often uncertain what to do in a crisis and had been neglected previously by care services. King’s incorporated into BSs family/carer views to ensure they were heard, supported, and could use the toolkit. Family members describe feeling more confident supporting patients with their breathlessness with less fear about the future: “...that certainly helped me...you know, I can probably help him to calm down” **\[I\]**. These benefits are evinced in service audits, reports and surveys from services in several countries **\[A, I\]**. 

 **Rapid impact during the COVID\-19 pandemic, local to multinational.** The consequences of the COVID\-19 pandemic meant that people with advanced diseases and breathlessness lost access to their usual services and needed to self\-manage at home. King’s researchers responded rapidly by co\-producing with patients, families, clinicians and best evidence from their breathlessness research, practical home guidance that could be implemented remotely. This was rapidly disseminated and then spread around the world with >80,000 Twitter impressions in less than a month, and adopted by Hospice UK **\[F\]**, the European Association for Palliative Care **\[F\]**, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics, and the patient led European Lung Foundation \(who report >275,000 views\) **\[J\]**.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Building on their early epidemic modelling work identifying the pandemic potential of the emerging outbreak of SARS\-CoV\-2 in China in January 2020, Jewell and Read have provided timely research evidence to the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling \(SPI\-M\) of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies \(SAGE\). For example, identifying the scale of within\-hospital infections, the impact of school reopening, the efficacy of household isolation measures, and spatial disease risk prediction across the UK. Their research has directly informed the development of national, international and regional disease control policies, such as local lockdown measures, resource planning, and travel restrictions. US government policy and their COVIDTracer planning tool were informed by their research. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research by Jewell and Read builds on previous work and expertise. Read previously used airline passenger data to understand epidemic exportation/importation risks for emerging epidemics \(2015\-2019\). Read also made the first large\-scale quantification of social contact patterns for viral transmission in China \(2014\). Since 2018, building on previous work undertaken at Liverpool University, Read has also helped quantify and characterise human interaction patterns in several low and middle\-income countries, in many cases providing the first such characterisation \(2009\-2019\). 

 Jewell’s expertise in real\-time inference on, and prediction from, epidemic models using Bayesian statistical methods has been critical in informing the underpinning work. Jewell’s work on computational Bayesian methods for epidemic models has allowed detailed spatial analysis of outbreaks in a variety of species and demographic settings \(2009\-2015\). More recently these analyses have been applied in the realm of outbreak management applied to diseases, developing computational frameworks to apply these methods to large datasets in both human \(e.g., food\-borne illness, anti\-microbial resistance, and visceral leishmaniasis\) and livestock \(e.g., foot and mouth disease, avian influenza, and bovine theileriosis\) diseases \(2015\-2019\). 

 The combination of Jewell’s expertise in epidemic model fitting and Read’s experience in using international flight data enabled them to rapidly develop the first transmission model of the SARS\-CoV\-2 pandemic fitted to case data, and to publish it online as a preprint on 24 January 2020 \[R1\]. This unique work, using Markov\-chain Monte Carlo \(MCMC\) to fit a network\-based deterministic epidemic model, leveraged temporal\-spatial information on cases arising to directly estimate key epidemiological parameters \(including R0, infectious period and ascertainment ratio\) of the emerging epidemic. This was significantly more informative than other contemporaneous simpler analyses, presenting very early evidence of the pandemic potential of the outbreak in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. 

 Read and Jewell’s combined research expertise has enabled them to further engage with the COVID\-19 pandemic modelling effort in the following ways: 

##  Modelling of contact tracing and school closure/reopening 

 Read developed a model of SARS\-CoV\-2 transmission in the UK that incorporated empirical data on contact patterns in the UK \(collected through a national survey by Read\) to identify how effective contact tracing would need to be to control the epidemic \(Mar\-Apr 2020\) \[R2\]. Read also developed a model exploring the impact of school re\-openings on epidemic dynamics and the extent to which contact tracing would be required to counteract the negative effects of school reopening on disease dynamics \(Apr\-May 2020\) \[R3\]. 

##  Clinical cohort analysis of COVID\-19 mortality risk factors 

 Read also analysed data collected by the COVID\-19 Clinical Information Network \(CO\-CIN\) study \[R4\], comprising a large cohort of hospitalised COVID\-19 patients from across the UK \(March 2020 onwards\). The current cohort consists of more than 100k enrolled COVID\-19 patients. The initial study paper \[R4\] analysed the first 20,133 patients enrolled before mid\-April 2020, and was the first to identify the comorbidities, age groups and sex risk factors associated with mortality for UK patients \(March\-May 2020\). The paper also described the symptoms these early COVID\-19 patients presented with, providing relative frequency and symptom groupings, enabling contemporary case definitions to be assessed and refined. Read contributed to the overall analysis plan and the analysis itself, specifically the characterisation of symptoms upon admission, drawing on his experience of quantitative analysis of hospital and infectious disease health data. 

##  Spatial risk and hotspot identification 

 Jewell and Read conducted the first spatially explicit analysis of COVID\-19 incidence within England \(May 2020\) using spatially\-coupled autoregressive time series methods. This represented a rapid response to demonstrating the interdependence of local authority\-level case incidence, and wide heterogeneity in case incidence across the country \[R5\].  Nevertheless, this work revealed a gap in statistical methods for fitting spatial epidemic models at the scale of an entire nation – this was required for measuring spatial reproduction numbers and accurate detection of COVID\-19 hotspots in a fast\-changing landscape of local “Tier” restrictions. 

 Jewell addressed this gap, developing a Bayesian spatial stochastic epidemic model based on his previous research in decision support for livestock epidemics. Jewell designed the MCMC\-based statistical methodology required to calibrate this mode, and implemented it using cutting\-edge GPU computing technology. The results have provided an unprecedented \(and to date the only\) detailed analysis of COVID\-19 spatial dynamics in real\-time \[R5\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Evidence from Read and Jewell’s key epidemiological analyses of the SARS\-CoV\-2/COVID\-19 pandemic presented in preprints, peer\-reviewed publications and reports and presentations for government advisory groups has influenced the way that governments, both in the UK and US, understand the spread of SARS\-CoV\-2, and has been instrumental in policy responses to the epidemic. 

###  UK Government Policy 

 In January 2020, in response to their paper on the China COVID\-19 outbreak \[R1\], Jewell and Read were approached by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub\-group \(SPI\-M\-O, a sub\-committee of SAGE\). Jewell and Read presented the evidence \[R1\] to the DHSC/SPI\-M\-O on 24 January 2020, which informed the situational awareness of the epidemic in early 2020; SPI\-M used this evidence to advise SAGE. SAGE subsequently included the evidence from \[R1\] in their briefings to the UK Government \(the DHSC\). Since February 2020, Read and Jewell have been members of the SPI\-M\-O, which continues to report directly to SAGE and Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms \(COBR\), contributing their research evidence on an ongoing basis to inform policies related to the following topics \[S1\]. 

####  Household isolation 

 As part of SPI\-M\-O, Jewell and Read used their previous experience in epidemics research to provide evidence to SPI\-M\-O from epidemic modelling theory on the likely efficacy of whole\-household isolation as a response to the infection of an individual with COVID\-19. SPI\-M\-O used the research, which showed that the policy was robust to non\-compliance, as evidence for household isolation as a means of controlling disease spread. Jewell presented the report, ‘Effect of compliance with whole household isolation in the COVID\-19 outbreak’, to SPI\-M in March 2020 \[S1\(b\)\]. It demonstrated that household isolation for 14 days in response to 1 person being infected was likely to be effective at keeping the basic reproduction number below 1, even with only 40% compliance. Additionally, on 11 March 2020, Read provided results from his new analysis to SPI\-M\-O of the potential for social contact reduction to control the COVID\-19 epidemic in the UK. In reference to this work, the Chief Scientific Advisor to the MoD and Deputy Government Chief Scientist stated, “ *These analyses have been important factors in shaping UK Government policy on controlling the pandemic. Isolation of the entire household when one person is infected has been the cornerstone of our efforts to control COVID\-19. This work had an immediate impact on policy and an effective and enduring impact on the control of community transmission*” \[S2\]. 

####  Schools 

 Evidence from a collaboration by Read with Bristol University, Essex University and Warwick University on the likely impact of re\-opening schools on the virus’s R number in the UK was presented to SPI\-M on 27 April 2020 and subsequently on 22 May 2020 to SAGE \(see SPI\-M\-O: Comments on Social Distancing Measures 1 and SPI\-M\-O: Comments on Social Distancing Measures 2\) \[R3\]. The Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government stated that the evidence was critical in forming advice to the government on the reopening of schools and on the need for an effective testing and contact tracing system to absorb the additional transmission and cases that reopening might generate \[S3\]. Schools were reopened in August/September across all nations of the UK, with profound impacts on the economy \(enabling parents to return to work\), children’s welfare, education and future life prospects. The Chief Scientific Advisor to the MoD and Deputy Government Chief Scientist stated, “ *Understanding the role of children and schools in the spread of COVID\-19 has been one of the most difficult tasks for SAGE...Having the thoughtful, careful, brilliant analyses provided by Dr Jewell and Dr Read has been essential for SAGE to be able to offer clear advice to HMG. As everyone knows the strong policy decision has been taken to keep schools open – second only in importance to our strategic direction that the NHS should keep functioning. HMG relies on SAGE for the science advice that underpins that decision and Dr Jewell and Dr Read played an essential role in generating that advice”* \[S2\]. 

  

####  Hospital transmission 

 In April 2020, Read was specifically tasked by SPI\-M\-O to analyse the CO\-CIN study data from UK hospitals to identify the scale of nosocomial \(within\-hospital\) transmission of SARS\-CoV\-2. Building on the analysis conducted in \[R4\], Read conducted additional real\-time statistical analysis, identifying the scale and heterogeneity of within\-hospital transmission in the UK during the first wave of the pandemic, and the results were presented to SAGE on 30/04/2020. This was the first dedicated analysis of SARS\-CoV\-2 transmission in UK hospitals and identified the scale of the problem and heterogeneities by NHS trust. The results were reported to SAGE and NHS leadership. From 12 April 2020, Read presented weekly analyses of the CO\-CIN UK COVID\-19 patient study data to SPI\-M\-O, indicating a continuing significant level of nosocomial transmission in UK hospitals during the first wave of the pandemic, with regional variation. SAGE used the analysis provided by Read to advise the government and the NHS about the risk of the spread of SARS\-CoV\-2 in hospitals, which was key to policy responses, as evidenced by the following statement from the Chief Scientific Advisor to the MOD and Deputy Government Chief Scientist, “\[SAGE\] *advice to the government and to the NHS on hospital transmission at this stage of the epidemic was reliant on the analysis conducted by Lancaster on the CO\-CIN data*. \(…\) *When people ask me “what do you wish you had known in February that you now know”, I say, “I wish we’d known COVID spreads so well in hospitals”. It was thanks to this expert and timely analysis of the CO\-CIN data that we knew as fast as we did how much nosocomial infection there was. The policy response has been to introduce frequent testing of all staff and, where possible, to keep COVID\-19 patients separated from others”* \[S2\]. 

####  Spatial analysis and “hotspot” detection 

 Jewell and Read’s work with SAGE, the Joint Biosecurity Centre \(JBC\), and Public Health England \(PHE\) to identify local ‘hotspots’ of cases \[R5\] supported PHE’s recommendations for the application of local restrictions applied to regions with high numbers of cases. Extending this work and previous work developing adaptive management tools for livestock epidemics \[R6\], in collaboration with researchers at Warwick University and Google Research, Jewell led the development of a fully Bayesian spatial stochastic model of COVID\-19 transmission in England. Early work demonstrating the high level of spatial heterogeneity in case incidence across England \[R5\] was presented to the Minister of Defence \(Con Wyre & Preston North, 30<sup>th</sup> May 2020\), kick\-starting the interest in spatial trends in viral transmission and leading to the provision of publicly available COVID\-19 case data at Local Authority\-level for local planning and research purposes. 

 Jewell now provides SPI\-M, the JBC, Scottish Government and the Cabinet Office with weekly reports of the estimated time\-evolving reproduction numbers, hotspot detection, and short\-term predictions of case incidence and prevalence at the Local Authority District level.  They are the only group capable of providing such estimates and predictions on a daily basis from principled statistical analysis using a spatially explicit model. The reports are used to identify future hotspots and provide an evidence base for the development of local tier restriction categories and subsequent evaluation of tier efficacy \[S2, S4, S5\]. The reports have been used by JBC/Cabinet Office in selecting which data to provide for the Prime Minister’s briefing ‘dashboard’, and for identifying local authorities with especially outlying behaviour compared to the national average. The reports have been, therefore, central to informing the decisions on tier allocations \[S5\]. The UK government’s Chief Scientific Advisor stated that the Lancaster outputs on spatial modelling outputs have led to improved efforts by the national health agencies to provide  [COVID\-19 case data](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) publicly, which are now routinely used by SPI\-M to generate ongoing COVID\-19 reports \[S3\]. The Co\-Chair of SPI\-M\-O said, “ *At this level, the Lancaster framework is the best available in the UK…I would be surprised if there were better globally…these interventions have been instrumental in the formation of our advice to Government*” \[S4\].  Referring to the spatial stochastic model \[R6\], the Chief Scientific Advisor to the MoD and Deputy Government Chief Scientist stated, “ *There is no question that this is the best spatial model that we have”* \[S2\]. 

###  Local Governments in the UK 

 Jewell and Read have contributed short\-term prediction results from the spatial stochastic model \[R6\] to the local authorities in Lancashire and to the Lancashire Resilience Forum. The North West region, including Lancashire, has experienced the highest infection intensity in England, and Read and Jewell’s predictions have provided a key evidence base for public health officials to perform agile planning and allocation of healthcare resources within the county \[S6, S7\]. This evidence, in particular the weekly regional reproduction number estimates and spatial reports on Pillar 1 and 2 positive testing projections, was critical to the advice provided by the Blackburn authority to schools, local communities and organisations. In addition, Blackburn with Darwen Council and the Lancashire Local Resilience Forum used the evidence to plan a wide range of responses to the pandemic, including resourcing of local contact tracing, understanding demands for council services, and determining potential future impacts on primary and secondary care. Read also provided hospital demand forecasts for the Merseyside Resilience Forum \[S8\]. The policy decisions by these local government bodies have directly affected communities, impacting a combined total of approximately 2,500,000 residents. 

###  US State Department 

 Lancaster research \[R1\] provided some of the first publicly available evidence of the extent and likely magnitude of the COVID\-19 outbreak in Wuhan and the threat of a pandemic. The study was exceptionally timely and contributed to full situational awareness of the emerging situation in China and the risks to the United States. In the words of the Director of the US Department of State Office of the Geographer and Global Issues \(Bureau of Intelligence and Research\), “ *Dr Read’s work filled critical information gaps as our agency grappled with consequential policy decisions following the emergence of the novel disease, which was not well understood at the time. We incorporated Dr Read’s research into our updates for senior US government policy makers, including the US Secretary of State*” \[S9\]. 

 Additionally, the analysis in R2 was used in a planning tool for contact tracing \( [COVIDTracer](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/COVIDTracerTools.html)\) in response to COVID\-19 that was made available online by the US Department of Health and Human services \[S10\].

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Human trafficking and modern slavery have rapidly become a global concern. The International Labour Organisation estimated in 2016 that, at any given time, 40.3 million people were held in modern slavery. In the UK, the goal of eradicating human trafficking and modern slavery has received considerable political attention and the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 has been identified as setting a world leading example. But the ability to prevent human trafficking and to support victims of trafficking and modern slavery depend on a complex range of factors that extend well beyond the adoption of this piece of legislation. 

 The research underpinning this impact case study has been conducted within the Centre for the Study of Modern Slavery \(CSMS\) at St Mary's University. The Centre was established in 2015 by Dr Carole Murphy and aims to provide a comprehensive response to modern slavery and human trafficking across three areas of activity: 

 • Evaluation and Applied Research 

 • Education, Advocacy and Awareness Raising 

 • Prevention, Policy and Practice 

 The report ‘A Game of Chance’ was commissioned by a philanthropic supporter of research and public engagement on the issue of modern slavery \( **3.1**\). The purpose of the research was to examine support provision for survivors of modern slavery. The Principal Investigator on this project was Dr Carole Murphy. Twenty\-nine semi\-structured individual and group interviews were conducted with non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) providing direct support to those affected by trafficking and law enforcement agencies engaged in initial identification, rescue, and support. 

 The overall results of this research were published by Murphy in 2020 \( **3.2**\). The research had three core outcomes: 

 \(i\)  It recommended *inter alia* that the Trafficking Survivor Care Standards be adopted by the government and that their adoption be monitored and enforced as a minimum standard of care when working with people affected by modern slavery. 

 \(ii\) Having identified the gaps in training for professionals working with people affected by modern slavery that affected the treatment of and outcomes for survivors, the research recommended that all first responders and other staff in frontline services should be trained to a recognised national standard. 

 \(iii\) The research identified gaps in educational provision for people affected by modern slavery and recommended action to bridge these gaps.

 <ins> **Modern Slavery \(Victim Support\) Bill**</ins> 

 Murphy’s research was an integral element in the work conducted by Lord McColl in developing the Modern Slavery \(Victim Support\) Bill which he introduced to Parliament in 2019. Murphy’s research was used by the charity CARE, which worked with Lord McColl in providing several briefings for parliamentarians \( **5.1**\). Specifically, Murphy’s research findings in relation to gaps in support for survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking in the UK assisted CARE by confirming anecdotal evidence from charities involved in supporting survivors of modern slavery. It then enabled CARE to provide written evidence of these gaps. CARE then collaborated with Murphy and the Rights Lab at Nottingham University on a cost\-benefit analysis of the Modern Slavery \(Victim Support\) Bill, which subsequently has received an ESRC grant \( **5.2**\). This work helped CARE in making the case to Members of Parliament in favour of longer\-term support provision for survivors of modern slavery. This research also assisted Lord McColl in discussing his proposed Modern Slavery \(Victim Support\) Bill with colleagues and government ministers and was used in briefing parliamentarians and government ministers during private meetings and in relation to debates in Parliament \( **5.1**\). Lord McColl sponsored the launch of the report, ‘A Game of Chance’ in the Palace of Westminster, using the event as a means of raising awareness of the issues highlighted in Murphy’s research. Although the Bill was not adopted in the 2019 parliamentary session, it was re\-introduced in January 2020 and is currently proceeding through Parliament. Lord McColl also introduced an amendment to the Social Security Coordination Bill to allow greater leniency in the treatment of survivors of modern slavery from the EU. This was accepted by the House of Lords but was rejected by the House of Commons. Nevertheless, in the process, the government put forward a compromise measure, which was accepted, and agreed to meet Lord McColl to discuss the issues raised by the Modern Slavery \(Victim Support\) Bill \( **5.1**\). 

 <ins> **Impact on</ins> <ins>c</ins><ins>ourt</ins> <ins>c</ins><ins>ase</ins> <ins>leading to change in Home Office policy**</ins> 

 Murphy’s research was submitted by Duncan Lewis solicitors as part of the evidence at the interim relief hearing before the High Court in April 2019 in the cases of NN & LP v SSHD \(CO/1040/2019, CO/1039/2019\) \( **5.3**\). In these cases the Claimants were survivors of trafficking, who were in receipt of support and assistance as per their entitlement under Article 12 of the Trafficking Convention and Article 11 of the Trafficking Directive. The Home Office fulfils this through its Victim Care contract with the Salvation Army. Both Claimants received positive conclusive grounds decisions under the National Referral Mechanism earlier in the year and were told that all forms of trafficking support would cease 45 days after this decision \(the ’45\-day rule’\). This was Home Office policy from 1 February 2019. Murphy’s research \(specifically the report ‘Game of Chance’\) was used to support the claimants’ challenge to the lawfulness of the decision to end their trafficking support and the lawfulness of the ’45\-day rule’ policy itself. Murphy’s report was submitted as part of the evidence at the interim relief hearing before the High Court in April 2019 as a means of demonstrating the ‘cliff\-edge scenario’ identified in the report. The research argued that this policy acted as a barrier to providing effective care for survivors and hindered their longer\-term support.  At the interim relief hearing, the Claimants were granted permission to challenge the lawfulness of the Home Office policy and a grant of interim relief was also made, effectively suspending the Home Office’s ‘45\-day rule’ policy. In June 2019, the Home Office conceded that its policy was unlawful and said it would no longer apply it, and instead committed to building a needs\-based policy to support survivors of slavery and trafficking \( **5.3 and 5.4**\). 

 <ins> **The</ins> <ins>d</ins><ins>evelopment of</ins> <ins>new p</ins><ins>rofessional</ins> <ins>t</ins><ins>raining**</ins> 

 One of the gaps identified in ‘A Game of Chance’ was the lack of professional training and training standards for professionals working with survivors of modern slavery. The report recommended that all first responders and other staff in frontline services should be professionally trained in this area. Working with colleagues in CSMS, Murphy developed a project proposal for a training course in ‘Identification, Care and Support of Victims of Modern Slavery’ intended for professionals working in this area. The business case for this research was accepted by the *Albert Gubay Charitable Foundation* which provided financial support for it and the project began on 1 May 2019 \( **5.5**\). A Steering Group was formed made up of CSMS members and sector professionals to oversee the development of the course. This training course is the first of its kind and provides a basis for reforming the standard of care delivery across the sector responding to the need identified in Murphy’s research and confirmed elsewhere. It is intended that the training will secure better outcomes for those affected by modern slavery and human trafficking by increasing the number of appropriately trained and well\-informed professionals capable of identifying, supporting, and providing care to them \( **5.5**\). 

 <ins> **The</ins> <ins>development of</ins> <ins>n</ins><ins>ational</ins> <ins>t</ins><ins>raining</ins> <ins>s</ins><ins>tandards and the revised Slavery and Survivor Care Standards**</ins> 

 Murphy’s research has been crucial in the work of the Steering Group that has overseen the development of the National Training Standard, which was launched in 2020. The National Training Standard involves collaboration between CSMS, Snowdrop Project, and Skills for Care \(a delivery partner for the Department of Health and Social Care\) \( **5.6**\). The Training Standard was launched by Dame Sara Thornton, the Anti\-Slavery Commissioner, who commended the work of the University and its collaboration with organisations in the sector both in developing the research and in the production of the standards at various points in the talk. She described the standards as “a brilliant example of collaboration between knowledge producers and knowledge users”. Thornton also made clear the importance of the standard for achieving her own strategic objectives as Anti\-Slavery Commissioner \( **5.7**\). 

 Murphy’s research \(specifically ‘A Game of Chance’\) was also cited in the revised Slavery and Trafficking Survivor Care Standards published by the Human Trafficking Foundation in 2018 \( **5.8**\). The Human Trafficking Foundation grew out of the work of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery and was established to support and add value to the work of the many charities and agencies operating to combat human trafficking in the UK. The standards apply UK\-wide to professionals and agencies involved in the delivery of services to survivors of modern slavery. The Human Trafficking Foundation has representation from over 100 key organisations across the UK including the Salvation Army which holds the government contract for provision of survivor support and Hestia which is one of the main sub\-contractors for the UK. The Foundation plays a leading role in shaping policy and practice in this area \( **5.9**\). 

 <ins>‘</ins><ins> **Horizons</ins><ins>’</ins> <ins>Summer School**</ins> 

 The findings from the research also identified a gap in education provision for survivors of trafficking, who often benefit from further education. In particular, the research found that the summer break had a significant impact on mental health. As part of its wider strategy of education and engagement, CSMS undertook to develop a project proposal to deliver a ‘proof of concept’ Summer School for such survivors with the aim of developing a long\-term sustainable model which could be rolled out to other institutions and sites. Donor funding \(£65,549\) was secured from the HSBC and the Co\-op and work started in October 2019 \( **5.10**\). The project is advised by a board of sector experts including Karen Anstiss \(Bakhita House\), Lara Bundock \(Snowdrop Project\), Sophierose Holt, \(HERA\), Joanne Chidwick \(HERA\), Sarah Videau \(HERA\), Deborah Stillman \(Hestia\), Kirsty Hart \(City Hearts\), Alison Scowen \(Co\-Op\).  The pilot Summer School was due to be delivered in July\-August 2020 but was postponed to June/July 2021 because of the Covid\-19 outbreak.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Southampton’s Coral Reef Laboratory \(CRL\) has used its research to increase understanding and awareness of the importance of coral reefs, their critical status and opportunities to halt their decline, at a local, national and global level among stakeholders and public audiences. The team focussed on: **\(A\) Knowledge transfer**, working with industry to commercialise new products in the aquaculture and medical research sectors, and with policymakers to change environmental policy in the Middle East for the protection of coastal ecosystems. **\(B\)** **Educational programmes and public events**, engaging >4 million people from 128 countries, including schoolchildren, teachers, families, lifelong learners and policymakers, in coral reef science and inspiring them to take action, through online courses, face\-to\-face presentations and award\-winning interactive exhibitions. **\(C\)** **Increasing public awareness**, engaging millions of people in >24 countries in their research via print, online and broadcast media and contributions to high\-profile documentaries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research undertaken at the Coral Reef Laboratory \(CRL\) has advanced the understanding of symbiotic reef corals. These organisms form the three\-dimensional framework of coral reefs – unique habitats that sustain the livelihoods of half a billion people and about a third of all marine biodiversity. Natural and anthropogenic disturbances impair the functioning of the coral symbiosis and threaten coral reef survival. Understanding how corals respond to interacting stressors is therefore a crucial component of knowledge\-based management and conservation programmes. 

 Research at the CRL has made significant contributions to the understanding of the roles of the coral host, the microalgal symbiont and the physico\-chemical environment in shaping the response of reef corals to stress. In addition, it has yielded advanced fluorescent marker proteins from coral reef organisms for biomedical research applications. The research was led by Wiedenmann and D’Angelo and was delivered together with Postdoctoral Research Fellows \(Rosset and Hume\), PhD students \(Smith, Bollati\), ten undergraduates and collaborators from the global scientific community. 

 Since 2012, the team has: 

1.  Created a genetically enhanced variant of a red fluorescent marker protein derived from the coral reef\-dwelling anemone *Entacmaea quadricolor* for imaging purposes in biomedical research \[ **3.1**\]. 

1.  Established the mechanism that explains how disturbances of the nutrient environment reduces the tolerance of symbiotic corals to stress\-induced bleaching \[ **3.2**\]. These findings are critical to regional coral reef management. 

1.  Discovered and described a new species of symbiont alga that is key to the survival of corals in the world’s hottest reef waters, and in the adaptation of corals to historic climate change \[ **3.3**\- **3.4**\]. These studies sparked great interest as they reveal mechanisms that corals can utilise to adjust to rising seawater temperatures in a warming world. 

1.  Elucidated the role of fluorescent pigments produced by the coral host in modulating the internal light availability for the benefit of its algal symbiont, specifically during coral bleaching \[ **3.5**- **3.6**\]. 

1.  Generated widespread interest in coral reefs by using the fascinating phenomenon of coral fluorescence \[ **3.5**\] to highlight the application of fluorescent pigments in medical research \[ **3.1**\] and as a gauge for the survival capacity of corals after bleaching episodes \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 



 **Figure 1: Relationship of underpinning research** \[ **3.1\-3.6**\] **, two\-way engagement in the three impact areas** \[ **A,B,C**\] **and the sources corroborating impact** \[ **5.1\-10**\] **.** 

 The CRL team used their research findings to generate impact in three key areas: **\(A\) Knowledge transfer:** They translated their research on fluorescent coral pigments \[ **3.1, 3.5**\] and coral stress physiology \[ **3.2**\- **3.5**\] into new commercial products for the life science and aquaculture sectors \[ **5.1**\- **5.2**\], and policy action and knowledge exchange in the Middle East to protect coastal ecosystems \[ **5.3**\- **5.4**\]. **\(B\) Educational initiatives:** Building on the visual power of coral fluorescence \[ **3.5**\- **3.6**\] and the colourful narrative of its medical research applications \[ **3.1**\], the team inspired both young people and lifelong learners to treasure coral reefs and to engage in action against the global coral reef crisis \[ **5.5**\- **5.8**\]. **\(C\) Public Awareness:** Through sustained engagement with broadcast, online and traditional media, CRL researchers have increased public understanding and awareness of the wonders of, and the perils facing, coral reefs highlighting the urgent need for new policy responses to protect them \[ **3.1**\- **3.6**\] \[ **5.9**\- **5.10**\]. 

 **A\) Knowledge transfer through industry collaboration and a new knowledge exchange forum** 

 **\(i\) Tropical Marine Centre London \(TMC\):** In collaboration with TMC, the UK’s leading supplier of innovative aquatic equipment, CRL research on the function of coral host pigments in optimising the internal light availability for their symbionts \[ **3.1**, **3.5**\] was translated into the development of an advanced near\-UV LED\-based aquarium lighting system. The collaboration came in response to comments from TMC customers that the company’s LED lighting systems, designed as sustainable alternatives to commonly used metal halide lamps, were causing their corals to lose colour \[ **5.1**\]. Findings in \[ **3.5**\] demonstrated that a near\-UV LED system would promote the natural fluorescence of corals, thereby enhancing enjoyment for coral enthusiasts and the sustainability of coral aquaculture. TMC was the first to launch this product in 2014, and since then over 2,185 units with a cumulative market value of approximately £200,000 were sold \[ **5.1**\]. As a result, the lighting concept was widely adopted across the industry. 

 The Head of Technical Development at TMC wrote that the CRL research was “ *key to aid the rapid and successful transition to reduced carbon footprint LED lighting solutions in the marine aquaculture sector*” \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **\(ii\) EMD Millipore Corporation:** CRL outreach on fluorescent host pigments \[ **3.5, 3.6**\] attracted the interest of EMD Millipore Corporation \(now Merck Millipore\) and led to knowledge exchange on applications of fluorescent proteins as molecular markers. A red fluorescent protein was licensed in May 2018 to the company for integration in their life science products for research purposes \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **\(iii\) The Mideast Coral Reef Society:** CRL conducted research in the Middle East to understand how corals tolerate high levels of environmental stress \[ **3.3**\- **3.4**\]. Wiedenmann recognised that the lack of a learned society for coral reef science in the region was limiting effective communication of scientific findings. Consequently, he initiated the founding of the *Mideast Coral Reef Society* *\(MCRS\)* in 2015 as a platform to communicate evidence to stakeholders and has since acted as one of its two chairs. More than 280 representatives of academic and governmental organisations, NGOs and private sector companies are MCRS members. In 2019, the MCRS achieved recognition as a regional chapter of the International Coral Reef Society \(ICRS\). 

 The ICRS stated: “ *The formation of the MCRS filled a significant gap in promoting communication of coral reef science across and within a region that is proving key to understanding the response of the world’s coral reefs to climate change and human impac*t” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 Interactions within MCRS resulted in Wiedenmann and D’Angelo collaborating with the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi \(EAD\), which advises UAE governments. They were granted access to environmental monitoring data, which they analysed in light of their findings from \[ **3.2**\- **3.4**\]. The outcomes were communicated at a workshop for senior members of governments from UAE and Kuwait in October 2017 \[ **5.4**\]. This led to CRL being invited to recommend evidence\-based changes to government monitoring programmes. The EAD implemented CRL recommendations to apply more sensitive analytical techniques to assess the quality of coastal waters, including coral reef stations; these continue to be widely used \[ **5.4**\]. 

 The EAD wrote: “ *The link between disturbances of the nutrient environment and coral mortality became a key argument in support of our efforts to completely reduce the introduction of municipal wastewater from Abu Dhabi in the sea to protect the coastal ecosystems and we expect that this goal will be achieved by 2022*” \[ **5.4**\]. 

1.  **Educational Initiatives:** 

1.  **Coral reef\-themed interactive presentations and workshops at schools:  CRL has engaged schoolchildren in its research to inspire them to pursue STEM careers and to be ambassadors of sustainable lifestyles that support coral reef survival \[ **5.5**\]. The researchers brought living corals, yellow filter goggles and blue light torches to classrooms for pupils to engage hands\-on with coral fluorescence. Events were attended by >1000 students at <ins> *four secondary schools*</ins>. A teacher at Marlborough College writes: “ *You gave them such a fascinating exploration into coral reefs which will make us all think about them differently*”. After an event attended by \~300 14\-18\-year\-old pupils at Downe House School, **100% of the responders confirm that they have learned something new** and **87% reported that they will change their behaviour in response to what they have learned**. A representative student response: *“I plan to try to be more eco\-friendly and reduce my plastic waste, and also cut down on red meat consumption*” \[ **5.5**\]. 

1.  **Permanent Exhibitions:** Three permanent live fluorescent coral displays were set up at major visitor attractions \[ **5.5**\]. The CRL team advised the <ins>\(a\)</ins> <ins> *Sea Life Centre at Chessington World of Adventures</ins>* and the <ins>\(b\)</ins> <ins> *Horniman Museum London*</ins> on aquarium set\-up, lighting and suitable tank inhabitants. As part of these displays, two tanks were shown side\-by\-side in a darkened room in each of the venues, one with daylight illumination showing the ‘natural’ colour, one with a near\-UV lighting system that shows only the coral fluorescence. The displays at both venues were accompanied by display boards that featured the research into functions and applications of coral fluorescence \[ **3.1**\]. Venues contributed funding for these projects. Displays were visited by \~4.2 million people \(Chessington Sea Life Centre, August 2013\-2020\) and \~120,000 people \(Horniman Museum *,* August 2013\-2016\). The aquarium curator at the Horniman said: “ *Visitors were always fascinated by the glow of the corals and the research and wanted to learn more about the science behind this phenomenon during guided tours*” \[ **5.5**\]. CRL also introduced an interactive live coral display as a new teaching and outreach tool in the reception area of the <ins>\(c\)</ins> <ins> *National Oceanography Centre Southampton*</ins> <ins>\(NOCS\).</ins> Visitors can change the illumination of the tank to explore coral fluorescence. The tank, funded by NERC and sponsored by TMC, has become a central educational feature \(\~70,000 visitors over August 2013\-2020\), in particular during NOCS open days \[ **5.1**\]. 

1.  **Temporary Exhibitions:** CRL staged four coral fluorescence\-themed exhibitions featuring interactive displays in which visitors gained hands\-on experience of exploring the potential of coral fluorescence for reef monitoring purposes and biomedical research \[ **3.1, 3.5**\]. This phenomenon was used to communicate how climate change and regional water quality affect reef survival \[ **3.2**\] \[ **5.5**\- **5.6**\]. Exhibits were presented at the <ins>\(</ins><ins>a\)</ins> <ins> *Marine stand</ins><ins>*</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins> *Southampton Boat</ins> <ins>S</ins><ins>how 2015*</ins> \(\~27,300 visitors; **rated 2<sup>nd</sup> most popular stand**\), <ins>\(b\)</ins> <ins> *Southampton Science and Engineering Festival 2017*</ins> \(\~700 actively engaged visitors; **exhibit won the ‘Wow\-factor’ award**\) and the <ins>\(c\)</ins> <ins> *Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 4</ins><ins>th</ins><ins>\-9</ins><ins>th</ins> <ins>July 2017*</ins>. In the school student survey conducted by the Royal Society, **51% of students chose CRL’s **\#GlowingCorals** as ‘best exhibit on show’** \[ **5.6**\]. \#GlowingCorals was seen by an estimated >13,000 visitors and it received 100% positive comments from 233 survey participants. A representative comment reads: “ *Who wouldn’t want to be a scientist after seeing the glowing coral exhibition?*”. A video on the research featured in our exhibit was published on the Royal Society’s YouTube channel \(>3000 views\). A fluorescent coral exhibit and information stall featuring research on coral fluorescence and the effect of nutrient pollution on reef survival \[ **3.2**, **3.5**\] was displayed at the <ins>\(d\)</ins> <ins> *Commonwealth Marine Science Event*</ins> held in April 2018 at NOCS as part of the *Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting London 2018*. At the event, The Rt Hon Thérèse Coffey MP, UK Environment Minister praised our “ *ground\-breaking work”*, and announced that the UK was joining the Coral Reef Life Declaration, a global commitment to safeguard coral reefs \[ **5.5**\]. 

1.  **Massive Open Online Course \(MOOC\):** CRL translated its findings \[ **3.1**\- **3.5**\] into three chapters of a new version of the UoS MOOC “Exploring our Oceans”. The MOOC ran four times from 2019\-2020, actively engaging **6,980 participants from 128 countries** spanning the high\-, middle\- and low\-income categories. Evaluations asked participants: Which of the six marine ecosystems featured in the course would you like to explore further? **Coral reefs came either first or second** across all the evaluations. **99.5% of the participants answered that they had gained new knowledge or skills**. Out of the responding participants, **62% have applied what they had learnt and 78% shared what they had learnt with other people.** A representative comment on the coral reef section reads: *“Incredible. It makes me determined to do that little bit more to protect the oceans”* \[ **5.5**\]. 

1.  **Teacher Training:** Teacher training based on the research in \[ **3.1**\- **3.3**\] was delivered by the *XL Catlin Ocean Academy*. Workshops included theoretical and practical components and were delivered in 2014 and 2015 for 35 teachers. An external evaluation demonstrated changes in perception and impact on practice. One teacher said: “ *Research was made accessible to a level that I am now able to deliver it myself as a Geography teacher of 11–16\-year\-olds \- who one day I hope to see continuing the critically important work Jörg and his team carry out today”* \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **\(vi\) Training Workshop** **for Artists.** CRL collaborated with artist Glenn Morris to deliver an educational workshop for UK professional artists. The aim was to initiate the production of artwork inspired by the colour changes of stressed corals \[ **3.2**, **3.5**, **3.6**\] in order to communicate the impact of local water quality and global climate change on coral reef survival \[ **3.2**\]. As an outcome of the workshop, the exhibition “BLEACHED” was set up together with 12 artists as an integrated and interactive science and art exhibition designed to explore the scientific messages from \[ **3.2**, **3.5**, **3.6**\] in creative and innovative ways \[ **5.8**\]. The exhibition was scheduled for March\-April 2020 at God’s House Tower Southampton, the flagship venue of the Arts Council organisation *A Space Arts*; it was postponed due to the Covid\-19 pandemic and will run once permitted \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **C\) Public Awareness** 

 Proactive media engagement significantly broadened the reach of CRL research. The key scientific messages of \[ **3.2**\- **3.6**\] were covered by 450 print, online and broadcast media items with a multi\- million reach in >24 countries, including coverage by major news channels \( *CNN*, *ABC, CBC\), The Economist*, *The New York Times,* *National Geographic*, *The Times*, *The Independent*, *Daily Mail*, and *Nature* **.** The impact of these activities is demonstrated by two\-way engagement with the media: 

1.  **Documentaries:** In addition to international radio broadcasts and online podcasts, research in \[ **3.1**\] and \[ **3.2**\] was featured twice on BBC Radio 4’s *Inside Science* in 2015 \[ **5.10**\]. The research in \[ **3.6**\] is a key component of a new three\-part series for BBC and Netflix called *Life in Colour* with Sir David Attenborough. It was made in 2020 \(i.e., during the REF2021 period\) and will be shown at prime time in April 2021 \[ **5.9**\]. The producer wrote: ‘ *We have an engaging, concise and stunning looking sequence which will bring to the public both the terrible implications of coral bleaching, and a novel mechanism how coral use fluorescence to protect themselves against stress*. *From our experience, this type of narrative will be most effective to inspire a large number of viewers to engage actively with the subject*’ \[ **5.9**\- **5.10**\]. 

1.  **Invited interviews on broadcast media and invited outreach articles:** Journalists responded to the CRL public engagement, resulting in broadcasting of 22 interviews specifically related to the underpinning research \[ **3.1\-3.3**, **3.5\-3.6**\]. Highlights include interviews with *The New York Times* \(2017, 2020\), *IFLScience,* *Scientific American, The Independent*, *The Times* \[ **3.6**\], *ABC News Australia* \(2017\), and 2x *Naked Scientist* \(2017\) \[ **3.5**\]. An interview in the *“Living on Earth” program with Steve Curwood* was distributed to 250 public radio stations in the USA \(2015\) \[ **3.3**\] \[ **5.10**\]. In addition, CRL researchers were invited to write about their research \[ **3.2, 3.4, 3.6**\] by the editors of *The Conversation,* *Ocean Challenge, Science Breaker, COSUST* and *Coral.* The article in *The Conversation* on the research in **3.6** was republished by 15 outlets \(>89,000 confirmed reads\) and shared by 10,600 Facebook users and 141 times on Twitter \[ **5.10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Cryptococcal meningitis \(CM\) is an opportunistic fungal infection that is responsible for approximately 15\-20% of deaths of people living with HIV\-infection. 

 LSTM has played a leading role in pivotal trials that have evaluated novel approaches for the prevention and management of CM in low\-resource settings. We have identified novel biomedical treatment and prevention strategies that are practical, low\-cost and effective, which have been incorporated into World Health Organisation \(WHO\) guidelines and led to changes in clinical practice in Africa. Our research findings stimulated investment in a generic version of a key drug identified in our research \(Flucytosine\) to increase access for low\-resource settings and also catalysed a USD20,000,000 investment from the global health organisation, UNITAID, enabling seven African countries to acquire the supported by the trials. These are being rolled out in the first quarter of 2021, combined with training of health care staff. Together, these improvements to CM management are saving tens of thousands of lives annually in Africa and other low\-resource settings.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Despite significant advances in the availability of HIV care and treatment, a large proportion of HIV positive \(HIV\+\) patients in resource\-poor settings will present with advanced disease and die from opportunistic infections. CM is the most common such infection. In 2014 there were 225,000 cases globally with 180,000 deaths. In low income countries \(LICs\), the 12\-month mortality of cryptococcal meningitis is approximately 70%, compared to between 20% and 30% in high income countries \(HICs\). The main causes for this can be summarised as: 

-  Limited ability to detect cases early and prevent development of disease 

-  Limited availability of affordable and appropriate antifungals 

-  Uncertainty about the optimal antifungal regimen 

-  Limited ability of the healthcare system to monitor and manage treatment‐limiting toxicities of the antifungal drugs. 

 Our research focussed on two approaches for reducing deaths from CM in HIV\+ people: 

 **Combination Treatment** 

 Lalloo \(Director, LSTM, in collaboration with Oxford University\) conceived, gained initial funding and instigated a phase 3 trial in Vietnam \(conducted between 2004 and 2010\) which compared 4 week amphotericin B monotherapy with 2 weeks combination therapy of amphotericin B and either flucytosine or fluconazole. A combination of intravenous amphotericin B combined with oral flucytosine led to a decrease of over 40% in all\-cause mortality when compared with intravenous amphotericin B monotherapy. Combination therapy of amphotericin with fluconazole did not improve patient outcomes \[1\]. 

 This finding clearly demonstrated the value of combination treatment with flucytosine for the first time, led to changes in WHO policy and changed clinical practice in South East Asia. However, a 2\-week course of amphotericin B administered intravenously \(i.v\) requires regular toxicity monitoring and was prohibitively expensive in Africa, where the majority of CM cases occur. Furthermore, flucytosine was not registered anywhere in Africa and there were no generic formulations available. Instead in most of Africa, CM was routinely treated with 2 weeks of high dose oral fluconazole, which is associated with a high mortality rate \(of approximately 70%\). 

 The ACTA trial \(Advancing Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa 2015\-2018; Jaffar, co\-designed and co\-supervised the trial and co\-supervised the statistical analysis and dissemination; Lalloo: co\-investigator, supported design and set up of Malawi sites\) evaluated practical CM treatment regimens for Africa. It was the largest trial ever conducted in CM, with 9 sites in 5 countries, and compared three treatment strategies as well as the two alternative partner drugs for amphotericin B. The two new treatment strategies, consisting of either i\) 1\-week of i.v amphotericin B plus oral flucytosine or ii\) an all oral combination of flucytosine plus fluconazole, were compared with a 2\-week i.v. regime of amphotericin B combination\-based treatment. One week of amphotericin B and flucytosine was associated with lower mortality, and 2 weeks of the oral drug combination was non\-inferior to the 2 weeks of i.v amphotericin\-based regimens. Both the novel 1\-week i.v amphotericin B and all oral combination tested in ACTA had mortality rates between 2 and 3\-fold lower than observed with previous standard treatment practice in Africa of fluconazole monotherapy \[2\]. Crucially, we also showed that the 1\-week i.v amphotericin B was less costly as well as more effective when compared with the 2 weeks of i.v amphotericin\-based regimens \(reduction of USD500 per patient\) \[3\]. The combination oral regimen was also highly cost\-effective compared with fluconazole monotherapy, with an incremental cost\-effectiveness ratio of between USD28 and USD44 per life\-year saved \(costs adjusted to 2015 USD prices\) \[4\]. Thus, if flucytosine could be made available in Africa, then ACTA provides the evidence of regimens that could substantially reduce HIV\-associated mortality in Africa at lower cost. 

 The potent steroid dexamethasone had commonly been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of CM to reduce brain swelling. However, Lalloo \(in collaboration with Oxford University\) co\-designed and played a key part in running a phase 3 trial in 6 countries, between 2013 and 2014, which showed that dexamethasone did not reduce mortality in CM and was actually deleterious with more adverse events \[5\]. 

 **Detection and pre\-emptive oral treatment** 

 Once CM has developed \(i.e. the infection has reached the brain\), then treatment becomes hugely challenging. Screening for cryptococcal antigen \(CrAg\) in immunosuppressed patients, combined with pre\-emptive antifungal treatment, can prevent many cases of CM as CrAg is detected in the blood weeks to months before symptoms of meningitis appear. 

 The REMSTART trial, between 2012 and 2015, led by Jaffar whilst at LSHTM, found that screening serum for CrAg combined with an adherence package led to a decrease of 28% \(95% confidence intervals 10% \- 43%\) in all causes of mortality. After joining LSTM in 2015 Jaffar and Niessen led the health economics analysis of REMSTART, showing that the intervention was highly cost\-effective with health service care cost per life\-saved of USD70 \(based on 2017 USD \[6\]\). Jaffar was also a key investigator on a follow\-on study, TRIP, funded by EDCTP \(European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership\) designed to facilitate the scale up of the approach tested in REMSTART. Working in 18 health facilities in Tanzania, TRIP demonstrated that the intervention could be scaled up in low\-resource settings in a cost\-effective way, achieving similar efficacy as seen under trial conditions. 

 Furthermore, the CRYPTO\-PRO trial \(commenced 2004; Lalloo PI: conceived, designed and supervised trial\) demonstrated that use of routine fluconazole prophylaxis prevented cryptococcal disease in patients who could not rapidly access antiretroviral therapy \[7\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our studies identified improved and cost\-effective solutions to prevent and treat CM in low resource settings. The inclusion into WHO guidelines between 2013 and 2018 led to widespread adoption of these new approaches in most countries when practicable. This benefitted both individuals living with HIV and at risk of the opportunistic infection CM, and resource\-poor healthcare systems, particularly in Africa, by improving outcomes and reducing the costs associated with CM treatment. 

 **Influence upon treatment guidelines and clinical practice.** 

 The Vietnam trial demonstrating clear benefit from combination therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine in terms of survival rates, and showing that both drugs could be safely administered in settings where therapeutic drug monitoring is not available, informed policy and clinical practice in many countries \(including Germany, USA, Australia and Indonesia\) and has underpinned WHO recommendations for combination therapy since 2013 \[1,2\]. 

 Although most countries in Africa typically follow WHO guidance, this new treatment regime was not widely adopted in this continent due to resource constraints. The ACTA trial evaluated practical comparatively low\-cost interventions for Africa including a new, shorter treatment regime which proved to be highly cost effective. It led to an immediate change in WHO guidelines, published simultaneously alongside the paper in 2018 recommending this regimen as the gold standard for CM management \[2\]. The advice to change to the ACTA regimens was graded as “strong recommendation, moderate\-certainty evidence”. The dexamethasone study demonstrating that use of corticosteroids was harmful in HIV\-related CM was also cited as high\-quality evidence against the use of dexamethasone in the 2018 WHO guidelines \[2\] and immediately influenced clinical practice in many countries, being adopted into US IDSA guidelines in the same year for example. The findings of all these trials are included in the on\-line decision\-making resource ‘UpToDate’ used by 1,900,000 doctors worldwide \[3\]. 

 The WHO had been recommending CrAg screening and it changed its guidelines to “strong recommendation” following the REMSTART trial \[4\]. However, uptake of this recommendation has been very limited outside of South Africa \(which has a well\-funded health system\), because the REMSTART package was a complex intervention involving both patient empowerment and CrAg screening and needed substantial infrastructure and resources to scale\-up. The TRIP study adapted the REMSTART package and demonstrated that a\) it can be scaled up in a low\-resource setting and b\) that in a real\-life setting, the death rate is as low as observed under trial conditions in the REMSTART trial. Tanzania, with one of the weakest infrastructures for their HIV programmes, has used the evidence generated to scale up screening for CrAg in over 200 health facilities so far \(over 1,000,000 people with HIV\-infection in the country\) and by the end of 2021 coverage is expected to cover the entire country. 

 The CRYPTO\-PRO trial demonstrated the value of fluconazole prophylaxis in certain populations and was one of only two studies contributing to “high quality evidence” for recommendations in the 2017 WHO advanced HIV guidelines \[4\] and 2018 WHO Cryptococcal guidelines \[2\] recommending that fluconazole prophylaxis should be used in patients with advanced HIV that could not immediately access antiretroviral therapy. 

 **Implementation of revised guidelines for CM treatment and diagnosis.** 

 As a result of the ACTA trial findings and WHO recommendations that followed, in January 2019 UNITAID announced USD20,000,000 funding to support 7 African countries to scale the WHO recommendation on advanced HIV disease \(which REMSTART and TRIP had informed\) and scale up management of CM \(which ACTA had informed\) \[5\]. The African countries targeted by UNITAID were Tanzania, Nigeria, South Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Lesotho, and Uganda and they have used the funds to support training of health care staff and acquire commodities including CrAg tests and treatments \(flucytosine and amphotericin\). The US Centers for Disease Control has also invested in supporting governments to scale up CrAg screening in these countries and approximately 21 other countries in Africa, who are at varying levels of scale\-up. On the basis of our research, it is evident that this rapid adoption of improved screening and treatment strategies has been key to saving tens of thousands of lives in the continent with the highest burden of CM. 

 **Increased availability of treatment** 

 Prior to the ACTA trial, flucytosine was not registered in Africa and no generic formulation existed. The results from this trial incentivised the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture flucytosine and the WHO approved the first generic version of this drug, manufactured by Mylan, in 2018 \[6\]. Other pharmaceutical companies started working on generic flucytosine in 2019 including Lupin Pharmaceuticals \(India\), Strides Pharma \(India\), Macleods Pharmaceuticals \(India\). This will ensure, for the first time, that CM management will become widely available in many more centres. In those centres unable to provide the gold standard of i.v. amphotericin and flucytosine, an effective oral combination regimen of   fluconazole and flucytosine can be used \(this is far superior than using fluconazole alone, as was common practice prior to the ACTA trial\).

 Research from the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Digital Education contributed to enhancing digital literacy, particularly within the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence \(CfE\), informing curricular change and research\-informed development of professional learning for teachers. This work now reaches 51,000 teachers and over 600,000 pupils in all 2,514 state primary and secondary schools across Scotland. To successfully embed digital literacy within the education system, the researchers: 

-  advanced national curricular change by informing the revised CfE Technologies curriculum; and 

-  enhanced teachers’ capacity to support pupils’ computer science learning by developing research\-informed curriculum resources and professional learning opportunities to embed the curricular changes.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 In collaborative research across the University of Edinburgh’s Moray House School of Education and Sport and the School of Informatics, Robertson, Manches and Pain have argued that children have a right to understand the strengths, limitations and potential risks of the technology which permeates their lives \(3.1\). This empirical research, led by Robertson, found that children often lack basic factual knowledge about how computer hardware and software work. The researchers also found that younger children tended to believe that computers have agency by wanting to help them carry out tasks, but overall the children participating in the study were divided and unsure when asked whether computers can think. These findings have important implications since children require basic knowledge of computer architecture to support them to reason realistically about possibilities and pitfalls of future technologies, including artificial intelligence. 

 In a subsequent paper \(3.2\), Robertson and colleagues from other institutions documented the theoretical perspective behind the curricular change which they influenced in computer science \(CS\), showing the importance of helping children understand how machines and languages are used to create artefacts \(3.1\), in addition to developing computational thinking skills. They described why efforts to make CS entirely focused on “computational thinking”, in the absence of knowledge of “computers”, are mistaken. They noted the importance of teaching young learners about computational thinking in everyday life, machine architecture, the semantics of programming languages, and building new software. The paper argued that learners require an understanding of three key aspects of CS education: 

1.  domains in which computers operate, 

1.  the computational mechanisms that make computers work, and 

1.  how to use the computational mechanisms to model aspects of the domains. 

 It is notable that computing curricula at school level in other countries typically focus only on aspect 3, often in the form of writing computer programs. Exploration of common computational processes such as searching or sorting which have many real world applications, or understanding how computers execute instructions in programming languages is often left until university\-level courses. The research argues that, for computer science to take its intellectual place beside other sciences at school level, all three foundational concepts should be taught from an early age. 

 Because topics such as CS are typically new to teachers, it is important to support them through resource development and professional learning. CS, in common with other scientific disciplines, requires the understanding of deep concepts and subject\-specific pedagogy as well as practical skills with the various technologies used to develop that understanding. Using a realist evaluation methodology, Robertson led the analysis of evidence gathered on the PLAN C project, a professional development programme designed to support secondary CS teachers at a time of substantial curricular change \(3.3\). The paper’s particular focus is on the formation of a professional development network of several hundred teachers across Scotland. The researchers analysed evidence from a series of observations and teacher surveys over a two\-year period with respect to the PLAN C programme theory in order to illustrate not only whether it worked as intended but why. Results indicated that the PLAN C design has been successful in increasing teachers’ professional confidence and it appears to have catalysed a powerful change in attitudes to learning. The researchers’ recommendations for teacher professional learning were to: 

-  encourage teachers to engage with pedagogical theories and emerging evidence from the current research literature; 

-  enable teachers to address gaps in their conceptual CS understanding; 

-  provide contexts where teachers are regularly able to engage in high\-quality professional dialogue with peers in their subject \(during which teachers should reflect on their classroom practice, question how their students’ learning could be improved and share ideas with each other\); and 

-  create an expectation that teachers will try out new teaching techniques regularly and reflect on these with their peers.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The research of Robertson and colleagues had impact in two main areas as detailed below. 

###  Advanced curricular change 

 Based on her research and practice in supporting CS education, starting in August 2014 Robertson contributed to a group convened by the British Computer Society and Nesta to consider what skills and concepts primary children should learn within the field of computing and information and communications technology \(ICT\), and at what stage in the curriculum \[5.1\]. The group was convened by Kate Farrell, who is now Director of Curriculum on the Data Education in Schools project at the University of Edinburgh, with Robertson as a member. During these meetings, Robertson worked with Farrell, Cutts \(University of Glasgow\) and Connor \(Strathclyde University\) with input from Education Scotland staff to develop the ideas underpinning the three significant aspects of learning, which are reflected in the researchers’ work \(3.2\). 

 In autumn 2016, Education Scotland invited Robertson and Farrell to join a working group revising the Technologies curriculum within the Curriculum for Excellence \(CfE\) \[5.1\], which supports over 51,000 teachers who work with over 600,000 learners in Scotland throughout their broad general education. Robertson, Farrell, Cutts and Connor collaborated to enhance the curriculum draft so that it aligned with the academic recommendations and research findings. These contributions have enhanced the curriculum in two important ways: 

 A\) Drawing on the research \(3.1, 3.2\), the Technologies curriculum now includes CS as a distinct area of learning, supporting learners to develop CS knowledge and skills in a coherent line of progression \[5.2\]. 

 B\) This curriculum supports curriculum organisers to implement the research findings by including the three key aspects of CS education identified by the researchers \(3.2\) within a broader framework of “key concepts” \[5.2\]: 

-  The concept “Understanding the world through computational thinking” \(TCH 0\-13a to TCH 4\-13b\) corresponds to what the research refers to as “1\) domains that can be modelled by computational mechanisms”. 

-  The concept “Understanding and analysing computing technology” \(TCH 0\-14a to TCH 4\-14c\) corresponds to “2\) computational mechanisms themselves”. 

-  The concept “Designing building and testing computing solutions” \(TCH 0\-15a to TCH 4\-15a\) maps to “3\) how to use the computational mechanisms to model aspects of the domains”. 

 Describing the curricular change, one teacher said: *“The change in curriculum has been transformational in terms of Es and Os \[curricular expectations and outcomes\]. …This is very different from other curriculums. Many are very content led. This was future proofed*” \[5.3\]. 

 Furthermore, a Policy Executive from the Scottish Government’s Learning Directorate described Robertson’s contributions to the curriculum change: *“The valuable work you undertook was significant in the wider aim of updating the curriculum to reflect the rapid and on\-going changes in digital technology within our society”* \[5.1\]. He highlighted: *“We particularly valued the academic expertise you brought to the discussions and the collaboration with Computing at Schools Scotland and the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance to ensure that learners have the opportunity to use computational thinking as a means of developing capabilities in problem solving and computing science”*. 

###  Developed research\-informed curriculum resources and professional learning opportunities to embed the curricular changes 

 The Education Scotland Technologies working group acknowledged that the introduction of a specialist curricular area such as CS within broad general education was ambitious since it would require a steep learning curve for non\-specialist teachers. Therefore, to support teachers in updating their practice, a group of academics led by Robertson and Farrell ran a series of professional learning events which were designed based on the research findings \(3.3\) including a successful conference to accompany the launch of the new curriculum and a series of “Coding and Cake” workshops on programming and data literacy. Robertson and University of Edinburgh colleague Linklater, in collaboration with Edinburgh City Council and sponsored by the technology company CGI, ran a year\-long professional learning course in Computational Thinking for 14 Edinburgh\-based primary teachers, piloting activities that met gaps in teachers’ knowledge about CS. Participants commented that the workshops and course increased their confidence in CS skills and knowledge and provided them with effective CS teaching approaches that build on pupils’ existing knowledge \[5.3\]. 

 The University of Edinburgh team developed the Teach CS Primary Guide that explains the three key concepts of the revised curriculum informed by the research, providing various example activities for each curricular level and outcome. For example, to support children in the early years who are exploring computational thinking processes involved in everyday tasks and identifying patterns \(organiser 1, outcome TCH 0\-13a\), teachers may use simple activities to help children sort toys by colour or shape, or identify the steps in everyday activities such as hand\-washing. Sorting objects in the real world is conceptually similar to sorting information by attribute, which is fundamental to computer science. This Guide was distributed to all 2,019 primary schools in Scotland in 2017 and to 1,200 subscribers to the *Times Educational Supplement Scotland* in 2020. 

 The Guide and related professional learning workshops were independently evaluated in February 2020 \[5.3\]. The purpose of the evaluation was to gather evidence of the impact \(if any\) that \(A\) the Teach CS Guide has had on the confidence and competence \(particularly understanding of CS concepts\) of primary teachers who have engaged with it while teaching the new computing science strands of the Technologies section of the CfE and \(B\) gather views from teachers about how the change in curriculum has impacted their learners. 

 The independent evaluator stated: *“Without a doubt, use of the Teach CS Handbook* \[Guide\] *has increased the confidence of those teachers using it”*. For example, one teacher reflected on the benefits: “ *although Es and Os are giving schoolteachers an understanding of what every child should understand in the curriculum, the document takes that and makes it much more manageable for teachers in schools”*. Another participant stated: *“If I hadn’t been directed to the handbook, I wouldn’t have changed my teaching. It made me see it in a different light”*. A different teacher said she regularly uses the Guide in shaping her teaching practices: “ *I use it to select my activities when I’m teaching computing science. That is what I go to; it is my go\-to thing, when I think ‘what should I be teaching?’”.* A primary teacher reflected on the different ways in which the Guide has enhanced colleagues’ teaching practices, since it has proved beneficial in terms of making technical vocabulary accessible to teachers and illustrating how each curricular aspect can be taught. For example, “ *it definitely helps older generation teachers who are not confident and also new teachers on ‘how do I actually teach it’”.* 

  

 A specialist in learning technologies for a Local Authority attended a short course run by Robertson and Farrell and, with permission from the researchers, subsequently created an open\-source, interactive version of the Guide that facilitates connections across section areas. This online resource has been shared with over 500 primary teachers across their Local Authority. As a result, *“It has led to a change in the way we are producing resources”* because senior leaders have adopted the Guide’s style for other curricular areas \[5.3\]. 

 Teachers’ enhanced practice as a result of the CS Guide and related resources has had a positive impact on pupils’ learning. For example, the Guide supports teachers to explain CS concepts in more accessible ways for children, *“helping pupils understand the concepts”* and supporting teachers to *“know the children are making progress toward this outcome”* \[5.3\]. Furthermore, teachers reported that the resources and interactive activities in the Guide have sparked pupils’ engagement and enjoyment of learning CS. 

 The evaluation report \[5.3\] concluded that: 

 *“Use of the handbook led to increased confidence among teachers – interviewees and, often, their colleagues. The handbook led to clearer understanding of key concepts and thus to an increase in teachers’ competence when teaching pupils about those concepts – to the benefit of pupils. The handbook has had an impact on teaching practices of individuals and also, through various planning processes and documents, on practices of colleagues.”*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by Bangor University’s ocean energy research group \(2009 \- 2020\) has pioneered understanding of the opportunities and challenges faced by the international tidal energy industry, of less energetic ‘second\-generation’ tidal energy sites. Bangor\-led research has directly informed the development of new wave\-tide interaction engineering models, the design of state\-of\-the\-art laboratory facilities \(to quantify/model the forces of asymmetric tides/waves on scale\-models of tidal turbine structures\), the selection of second\-generation tidal energy sites and tidal turbine design. Bangor’s wave/current interaction research informed the International Electrotechnical Commission \(IEC\) Technical Specification for tidal resource assessment and characterisation \(2020\), significantly changing the landscape of tidal energy project assessment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

####  Context 

 The ocean contains vast reserves of wave and tidal energy – approximately 2TW of each \(average global demand for electricity is approximately 3TW\). Since tides are predictable, and because the majority of tidal dissipation occurs in shelf seas, i.e. within range of grid connections, it is a highly attractive form of energy conversion. The first generation of tidal energy convertors focussed exclusively on high energy sites, requiring costly turbines working under extreme conditions, and so progress over the last decade has been modest. In contrast, modelling approaches developed at Bangor University \(led by Professor Simon Neill in collaboration with the University of Rhode Island \(URI\)\) have pioneered research into understanding the opportunities and challenges associated with less energetic tidal energy sites \[3.1\], including the influence of waves on the tidal energy resource \[3.2\], and the potential for concurrent development of sites to minimise variability in aggregated power output \[3.3\]. 

 Building on previous research into the influence of waves on tidal processes, Bangor researchers \(in collaboration with URI and Cardiff University via an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \(EPSRC\)\-funded project \[3.a\]\) investigated the influence of waves on tidal energy resource characterisation in situations where strong vertical shear in the water column co\-exists with energetic wave conditions, and helped inform resilient design and a new topic within tidal\-stream energy research. Bangor’s studies of phase diversity between tidal sites have highlighted the need to develop less energetic tidal energy sites. Bangor’s application of optimisation algorithms to inform site selection for tidal energy projects \[3.3\] has led the way for uptake of these methods by industry. 

####  Main innovations of the research 

 Research at Bangor \[3.1\] has identified a unique set of challenges and opportunities relating to less energetic tidal energy sites. The loadings on turbines at these sites allow for lower\-cost devices \(e.g. due to lower susceptibility to material fatigue\). There is increased sea space available for lower energy sites compared with high energy “hot spots”, and more opportunities for grid connectivity. However, less energetic sites are generally in deeper, more exposed environments, and so the resource is influenced by wave processes. 

 **a. Wave/current interaction.** Whereas previous research \(including Bangor’s\) focused on how tides modulate the wave climate \(for example within the context of coastal flood risk\), recent Bangor research has focussed on how waves influence the tidal energy resource. Bangor\-developed dynamically\-coupled models and observations of wave/current interaction demonstrate that waves influence the tidal energy resource by around 10% per metre wave height \[3.4\]. Further, Bangor\-led research has demonstrated that waves primarily influence the tidal energy resource through combined bed shear stress \[3.2\], particularly for power output at deeper, more wave\-exposed, second\-generation tidal energy sites. 

 **b. Tidal asymmetry and misalignment of waves and tides.** Bangor\-led research analysed the challenges associated with tidal energy sites that exhibit varying degrees of \(magnitude and direction\) asymmetry throughout the tidal cycle \[3.5\], and conditions where waves and currents are not aligned \(in\-line conditions are generally assumed in most flume experiments and previous modelling studies of wave/current interaction \[3.2, 3.4\]\). Bangor demonstrated that the majority of first\- and particularly second\-generation tidal energy sites will have a high degree of tidal asymmetry, as will the resulting power output. In most tidal energy sites, the waves and tides exceed 20 degrees out\-of\-line, with implications for turbine blade design and requirement for devices to yaw. 

 **c. Temporal variability and phase diversity.** Previous research, for limited sites, had shown that highly energetic ‘first generation’ tidal energy sites in the UK are in phase \(i.e. occurring at the same time\) with one\-another, hence the resulting \(aggregated\) electricity signal would be strongly semi\-diurnal, and so characterised by four periods per day of low/zero electricity generation – a problem for the integration of tidal energy into electricity grids. Bangor research has demonstrated, through optimisation, the increased phase diversity offered by including less energetic tidal sites in the energy mix \[3.3\]. Further, Bangor\-led research has shown the value of tidal energy due to temporal variability at much shorter time scales \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Challenges and developments in the tidal energy industry 

 The tidal energy industry traditionally relied on the development of overly ambitious \(e.g. 400MW\) tidal arrays in highly energetic rectilinear tidal environments. However, these high\-energy environment devices suffered many failures and financial setbacks for two main reasons: i\) severity of the environment, leading to structural failures and a need for heavily over\-engineered and expensive turbines; ii\) competition from offshore wind. Bangor’s research has re\-focussed the tidal energy industry, towards development of less energetic tidal sites that are complementary in terms of the timing of power output. 

 The wind industry took 40 years to transition from low\-power \(100kW\), to the much greater\-power devices of today \(10MW or more\), which now account for approximately 15% of UK electricity generation. As a direct result of Bangor’s research, the tidal energy industry has: i\) evolved to follow a realistic but contrasting path by developing smaller tidal devices \(second\-generation models\) \(100\-200kW\) that are now competitive in the UK; and ii\) created a pathway for international development via reassessment of the tidal energy resource of countries previously considered below the threshold of financial viability \(using the high\-resolution modelling approach developed at Bangor\) to significantly expand the global market. 

####  Development of second\-generation tidal device technology 

 In the UK, Bangor research has guided the research agenda of the UKRI Offshore Renewable Energy \(ORE\) Supergen research hub \(including 10 universities\), and the ORE Catapult \[5.1\], identifying common issues between offshore wind and tidal energy, the most important of which is development of floating technologies that can be used \(and in some instances directly shared\) between both forms of offshore energy conversion. Bangor\-led research into tidal asymmetry and misalignment of waves and tides \(making energy more challenging to exploit, and putting tidal turbine structures under stress\) has: i\) led to the development of new wave\-tide interaction engineering models; ii\) informed the design of state\-of\-the\-art laboratory facilities \(by ORE Supergen\) to directly quantify/model the forces acting on scale models of tidal turbine structures when tides and waves are out of line \(FloWave ocean energy research facility, University of Edinburgh \[5.2\]\); and iii\) directly informed tidal turbine design. 

 Bangor\-led research findings have been used to address challenges facing second\-generation tidal device technology globally, informing Australian researchers from CSIRO working on the GBP3,000,000 AUSTeN project, via the use of Bangor\-developed methodologies, to further advance coupled wave\-tide models for tidal energy resource assessment \[5.3\]. 

####  Importance of wave/current interaction on tidal energy resource assessment 

 Research on wave/current interaction at Bangor informed the International Electrotechnical Commission \(IEC\) Technical Specification for tidal resource assessment and characterisation \[5.4\], with Bangor research directly cited in recommendations that explicitly state that the role of waves in influencing the tidal energy resource needs to be assessed for tidal energy projects. It has informed developers about a unique set of challenges faced by second\-generation tidal energy sites \[5.1\]. Bangor’s research \(into the influence of coastal currents on wave propagation\) has directly informed large\-scale wave energy modelling projects conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation \(CSIRO\-Australia\) \[5.3\], and the US Department of Energy \[5.5\]. This has significantly changed the landscape of tidal energy project assessment. 

####  Maximising power supply to the national grid: the quality of tidal energy and UK tidal energy site diversification 

 Bangor research has demonstrated the value of tidal energy electricity to the UK grid system, highlighted in UK Government POST NOTE 625 \[5.6\]. This research, combined with our research into the development of lower energy tidal sites and the benefits of phase diversity, has led to European consortia \[5.7\] and the Isle of Man Government \[5.8\] recommending less energetic tidal sites as an important component of the future electricity mix. 

####  Tidal energy site selection by industry 

 Bangor’s phase diversity research has also directly informed the selection of second\-generation tidal energy sites by private industry \(e.g. Minesto, Repetitive Energy Ltd.\). Minesto, as the global leader in second\-generation tidal energy device technology, has developed tidal energy sites in the UK, including Holyhead Deep to the west of Anglesey, Wales. The GBP184,000,000 Australian Cooperative Research Centre, working closely with Dr Matt Lewis on his EPSRC fellowship \[3.b\], has made extensive use of Bangor’s research into tidal asymmetry and the challenges of second\-generation sites in their Blue Economy drive \[5.9\].

This has increased public engagement with philosophical concepts by providing a new way of conveying and teaching philosophy to enhance public understanding, while challenging conventional wisdom about philosophy’s relevance to personal and social life.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Jazz\-Philosophy Fusion has reached beyond the audience for prose and lectures, presenting a generalist conception of philosophy relating its traditional problems to both public concerns and private interests. This conception is defended in a monograph and journal article \(3.1, 3.3\), and the programme of applying traditional problems to contemporary issues is enacted in two monographs \(3.1, 3.2\). In the monographs, philosophical discussions of materialism, consciousness, the nature of the self, time, freedom and determinism, and truth, are related to natural personal curiosity about the meaning of life and why there is something rather than nothing, for example. They are also related to public concerns about directions being taken in technological development \(e.g. artificial intelligence and genetic engineering\), the negative impacts of internet technology and ‘post\-truth’ culture. This research demonstrates the continuing relevance of philosophy, both for satisfying rather than supressing curiosity, and for helping ensure that our lives are not directed by un\-reflected ideas embedded in our history, rather than by collective rationality and consent. 

 The underpinning research defends a conception of philosophy as a historical discourse acquiring new relevance to each new generation which is open to all, rooted in natural curiosity, and able to reflect impartially on religion, science, or any other field of discourse, guided only by rationality and truth. It presents philosophy as concerned with openness to debate and new ideas, rather than the closure of definitively solving problems. It presents philosophy as an empowering form of reflection that benefits public life by promoting open\-mindedness, collective rationality, and truth\-seeking, while being a source of personal cultural enrichment available to atheists and believers alike. As such, the impact flows directly from the conception of philosophy defended and enacted in the research; given such a conception, the importance of imaginatively seeking new audiences is motivated and the kind of impact \(essentially: the music inspiring independent philosophical thought\) is justified. 

 Jazz\-Philosophy Fusion conveys ideas in music, whether in the lyrics to songs composed especially for this purpose, through spoken passages with musical accompaniment, or in ‘vocalese’, an established technique in which lyrics are fitted to notable past improvisations. Tartaglia’s research demonstrates the unique appropriateness of jazz as a medium for inspiring philosophical ideas \(3.4\). Two complete albums of jazz\-philosophy fusion have been disseminated, both online \(5.1\) and through CDs distributed at concerts; other jazz\-philosophy recordings are available on the project website \(5.1\). 

  

 Tartaglia composed the monographs \(3.1, 3.2\) between 2004 \(Lecturer in Philosophy, Keele University\) and 2020 \(Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy\). He recruited and rehearsed the musicians and composed and arranged the music.

 Quality of Research: 

 3.1 was endorsed by Tim Crane as ‘a superb and original work’, went to paperback within months due to high sales, was reviewed in three journals \( *Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews*, *International Journal of Philosophical Studies*, *Philosophy in Review*\), and was the subject of a journal symposium \( *Journal of Philosophy of Life*, 7:1, 2017: 1\-315\), with 10 commentators \(including Philip Goff and Bjørn Ramberg\) and replies by Tartaglia. Bloomsbury published 3.2 in October 2020. While 3.1 focused on defending the generalist conception of philosophy and relating traditional philosophical problems to areas of natural individual interest, 3.2 focuses on relating philosophical problems \(esp. materialism and idealism, freedom, personal identity and truth\) to public concerns about technological development and ‘post\-truth’ culture. 3.3 is a defence of Tartaglia’s generalist conception of philosophy, published in the leading academic journal for this topic. 3.4 provides a theoretical and historical justification of the jazz\-philosophy fusion approach to generating impact for philosophy and was published in the leading peer\-reviewed journal for performance philosophy studies. 

 This research has been supported by an APRA Foundation Berlin Multi\-disciplinary Fellowship \(2015\-16, €5000\). It resulted in new music \(see below\), which has featured high\-profile professional jazz musicians with international reputations, notably pianist Steve Tromans, vocalist Jessica Radcliffe, and one of the most respected bassists on the Los Angeles jazz scene, David Hilton. The high\-quality of the jazz has been key to securing impact for the philosophy; the music is the medium for conveying the ideas.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Influencing Creative Practice and Increasing Public Engagement with Philosophy** 

 The albums \(5.2, 5.3\) perform key insights from Tartaglia’s research \(3.1 and 3.2\) relating to the importance of open debate, cultural enrichment and imagination to philosophy \(3.1, 3.2, 3.4\). The albums, a series of performances and the generation of interactive online content, have increased and diversified public engagement with philosophical research. 

  

 Through collaboration with public arts organisations and private music clubs, nine concerts of the two albums have been performed, reaching an estimated 750 people live at a range of diverse venues, including jazz venues, arts centres and a museum \(5.4\). Jazz audiences, in particular, have been a beneficiary of this research and activity. Tartaglia performed *Jazz\-Philosophy Fusion* \(2016\) at Cambridge International Jazz Festival \(November 2017\), which attracted around 15,000 visitors across 15 days of live music and workshops. In addition, the two creative outputs have been featured extensively in mainstream jazz platforms and publications, in the UK and internationally. For instance, all tracks from both albums were aired during the weekly jazz show of Radio Devin \(Slovakia\) as well as some tracks on community radio in the UK. On 20 September 2020, a two\-hour dedicated discussion programme was broadcast on Radio Devin, with the presenter and four philosophers \(Slovak and Czech\) discussing a selection of recordings made between 2002 and 2019 \(5.1, 5.5\). Midlands jazz blog: *Jazz Breakfast* \(over 5,800 followers\), featured an interview with Tartaglia \(September 2016\), and the first album was featured in *London Jazz News’* weekly showcase \(average circulation: 14,337\), with a full\-page feature in *The Birmingham Post* \(June 2016\) \(5.1, 5.5\). 

  

 Almost 500 CD albums of *Jazz Philosophy Fusion* \(2016\) have been distributed and the *Gods and Titans* \(2020\) digital album has received 2081 page visits. The broader project website has been viewed 44,964 times \(5.4\). Tartaglia has published accessible accounts of jazz\-philosophy fusion in the philosophy magazines *Philosophy Now* \(‘The Sound of Philosophy’, 2017\) *Filozofuj* \(in Polish, 2018\) and *The Philosopher’s Magazine* \(‘Jazz, Philosophy, Hate, Love’, 2020\). 

 **Enhanced understandings of philosophical ideas and challenging conventional wisdom about philosophy** 

 This extensive interaction with Tartaglia’s research has challenged audience preconceptions about philosophy, introducing them to new ideas and enhancing understandings of key philosophical concepts and problems. Listeners are taught philosophical ideas and problems in a new and engaging manner. Fifteen songs recorded across the two albums \(5.2, 5.3\) pose a range of critical philosophical questions interrogated in Tartaglia’s research, for instance, about the meaning of life, nature of selfhood, whether experience can be understood physically, whether freedom is possible, the value of honesty \(3.1, 3.2\). The music often presents opposing views on these issues, and performances encourage audiences to form their own opinions, through vocal prompts at live events and interactive questions in online fora \(5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10\). 

 The subsequent interactions from listeners and audience members reveal that the music inspired people to think on a wide variety of philosophical matters and often changed people’s perceptions about philosophical ideas. For example, over half of survey respondents reported changing their view on the relationship between personal identity and the self after listening to *Jazz\-Philosophy Fusion* \(2016\). One song from this album, ‘Teletransportation’, asks whether physical replication in another place can constitute travel, and 20 individuals reported changing their minds about this after listening to the song. When asked whether the song ‘The Transcendental Ego’ helped them understand what philosophers mean when they say that consciousness is private, 23 \(over half the total survey respondents\) agreed that it did \(5.6\). Listener responses to *God of Titans* \(2020\) reveal that over 76% thought that philosophical ideas presented in this way enrich their lives, with 60% indicating that the song in question inspired new ideas in them \(5.7\). 

 Comments demonstrate that the music stimulated listener thinking and deep reflection. One listener \(2016 concert\) commented, *“During the performance of Schopenhauer's Blues, I found that as the piece began descending into the chaotic end section...my thoughts were solely on the concept of right and wrong. I was having a really intense discussion with myself regarding my own morals..*.” Another audience member commented: ‘i *t occurred to me that perhaps that I am not a fixed, specific ""self' but a series of discrete selves existing only in the moment.”* One person reflected, “ *I experienced the power of succinctness of music: organised sound can abbreviate and intensify the use of words to express deep ideas by appealing to emotional depth”* \(5.6\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dementia is a global public health priority with no cure and limited medical treatment. Bangor University leads interdisciplinary research in dementia care, with a focus on visual arts interventions. Through a combination of training, public events and the success of the collaboratively\-produced online practitioners’ guide, ‘Dementia & Imagination’, for arts and health service delivery \(with over 10,000 downloads\) many people with dementia and their carers have benefited. Bangor\-led research demonstrated how arts interventions improved the quality of life of people affected by dementia, with GBP5 of social value generated for every GBP1 invested \(518% social value return on investment\). Bangor research also led to enhanced dementia care service\-provision, improved public perceptions and public policy influence. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Over the last decade, dementia policy rhetoric has changed, with WHO dementia policy calling for creative approaches to improve societal attitudes towards dementia, acknowledging the potential of arts activities for quality of life. Three Bangor\-led studies developed evidence, training materials and key insights, leading to integration of the arts into mainstream dementia care delivery. The research was conducted in England and Wales by Professor Gill Windle, Director of Dementia Services Development Centre Wales \(DSDC Wales\) and her team \(Dr Catrin Hedd Jones, Dr Katherine Algar\-Skaife and Dr Carys Jones\), combining quantitative and qualitative methods with public involvement to address: 

####  Health and cost benefits of the arts in dementia care 

 Windle led ‘Dementia and Imagination’ \[3.a\], an AHRC funded longitudinal mixed\-methods research programme \(England and Wales\), reflecting academic interdisciplinary collaborations between six universities, one charity, two cultural organisations, one local authority and fifteen artists. She led the development of a theoretically\-informed visual\-arts intervention consisting of twelve 2\-hour participative art viewing/making activities led by an experienced arts/health professional \[3.1\]. This intervention emphasised provision of a stimulating, high\-quality experience, demonstrating benefits to 115 people living with mild\-to\-severe dementia in diverse settings \(community, care homes, hospital day\-centres\) through validated measures of well\-being, quality\-of\-life and communication \[3.2\] \(with Hedd Jones providing expertise in systematic behavioural observation, generating novel quantitative ‘in the moment’ data on wellbeing\). For 146 family or professional carers across the same settings, Windle found a positive impact on social connectedness and wellbeing, improvements in how carers perceived the person with dementia and enhancement of professional practice \[3.3\]. Jones and Windle found the cost of delivering the programme was GBP189,498, but whilst the social value generated was GBP980,717. This constitutes a base case ratio of benefit to investment of GBP5.18 of social value generated for every GBP1 invested in the intervention, demonstrating significant value for money \[3.4\]. 

####  The benefits of arts in care homes 

 Algar\-Skaife led the Wales\-wide evaluation of Age Cymru’s ‘cARTrefu’, an arts in care homes project \[3.5\], the largest research evaluation of its kind in the UK. Arts activities \(visual arts, music, song and dance\) were delivered by arts and health professionals in 2\-hour workshops to 122 care homes across Wales \(19% of the sector\), with 1543 residents taking part in at least one activity. 793 residents contributed to the evaluation, which found significant improvements to their wellbeing. 272 care staff took part and reported qualitative improvements in skills and confidence. Significant improvements in a validated measure of attitudes to dementia care were reported by the 149 care staff who completed it before and after the arts interventions. 

####  Developing the skills of the dementia care workforce 

 Windle and Algar\-Skaife conducted research to examine the effect of ‘Creative Conversations’ \[3.b\] an arts\-based intervention for developing the care and communication skills of the dementia care workforce through a feasibility study, representing a partnership with a local authority and the private sector. In four 2\-hour workshops, care staff explored dementia education topics such as ‘understanding mood changes in people with dementia’ using novel creative materials \(poetry, film, music, visual art\) to influence the development of compassionate communication. Led by experienced arts and health professionals and delivered to 53 care staff in 14 care homes \(50% of care homes in Flintshire\), the intervention validated staff skills and confidence, and provided them with new ways to initiate, support and understand communication \(verbal and non\-verbal\) with their clients \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Knowledge and understanding generated by Bangor\-led research resulted in impacts on: i\) quality of life; ii\) dementia care improvement; iii\) enhanced service provision; iv\) public awareness of dementia; v\) public policy. 

####  Improvements to quality of life 

 Bangor\-led research showed that 37% of people with dementia experienced an increase in wellbeing from the arts interventions \[3.4\]. As a consequence, Bangor researchers developed a ‘dementia supportive practice community’, initially bringing together 70 people living with dementia, researchers, carers, health and social care providers to improve the quality of life of those affected by dementia. This is now an established network with 540 members \(across\-Wales\), utilising research findings and creative approaches to engagement. In 2019, 20 members with dementia and their carers \[5.1\] were empowered to become advocates, representing people living with dementia on international platforms, and becoming an established group of ‘dementia educators’ working alongside research and teaching at Bangor University and undertaking audits of public spaces \(e.g. National Slate Museum\) to guide improvements. In 2019, 1 person living with dementia was formally awarded an honorary fellowship in the School of Health Sciences at Bangor University \[5.1\]. 

####  Care improvement 

 Bangor’s collaborative research demonstrating the clinical and cost benefits of arts interventions in dementia care \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\] informed the jointly\-produced \(with Manchester Metropolitan University\) practitioners’ guide for arts service delivery \[5.2\]. The guide exemplifies best practice and enables care practitioners and providers to develop successful arts interventions, beneficial for people with dementia and their carers. The guide has received over 10,000 downloads \(up to July 2020\) and over 200 artists and health practitioners in England and Wales benefited from Bangor\-led training sessions. The 2015 training evaluation \[5.3\] indicates improved skills, e.g. “I will introduce objects into my art sessions with older adults and allow more time for participants to reflect and create” and being able to “take back new ideas to my workplace”. 

 Hedd Jones was awarded an Academic Fellowship by the National Assembly for Wales \(2017\), working closely with Assembly Members to identify and implement best practice in dementia care. She was a member of Social Care Wales committee \(2018\) developing a website of resources for dementia care professionals, with the practitioners’ guide \[5.2\] selected to be part of the resources \[5.4\]. In 2019 Bangor\-led research was included in a Wales Public Health Network e\-bulletin \(circulation: 1,415\) showcasing arts and health projects in Wales \[5.5\]. 

####  Enhancing service provision 

 As a result of Bangor’s research collaboration, Denbighshire county council reported the beneficial effects of improving dementia service provision \(via the arts\) within their organisation. Denbighshire county council were consequently recognised as the best local authority arts project in the UK for encouraging community cohesion, winning an award from the National Campaign for the Arts' Hearts for the Arts Awards in 2018 \[5.6\]. As a consequence of Windle’s research, Flintshire Social Services secured further funding in 2018 for a first round of wider \(arts interventions in dementia care\) delivery targeted at 81 new staff and extended it to 62 family carers. Feedback indicates the positive impact of the training on carers \[5.7\]. 

 Bangor’s recommendations following cARTrefu evaluation findings \[3.5\] led to changes to national dementia service delivery. Age Cymru secured additional funding to extend the arts interventions in dementia care service for 2 years. Following changes being made the service delivered an additional 864 arts sessions across care homes in Wales and in total 1840 art sessions have been delivered to 25% of care homes across Wales \[5.8\]. 

####  Improving awareness and understanding of dementia 

 The Dementia and Imagination research \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\] and the practitioners’ guide \[5.2\] underpinned the delivery of Bangor\-led workshops on living with dementia to 107 care professionals in 3 venues in England and Wales. A workshop evaluation \(2015\) reported that before the workshop, the most prominent words used to describe dementia were ‘ *loss*’, ‘ *disease*’ and ‘ *memory*’. At the end of the session, perceptions changed, with ‘ *misunderstood*’, ‘ *individual*’, ‘ *support*’ and ‘ *different*’ receiving more responses \[5.3\]. Workshops in 2016 with over 150 members of the public and care professionals found similar changes in perceptions before and after taking part. Care staff noted how “It helps me in terms of thinking about my career/ future: it is a good example of how psychology and art can be used together” and it “raised awareness of what is possible” \[5.3\]. 

 Bangor curated some of the work generated by research participants and held 7 exhibitions in national galleries \(e.g. The Menier, London\) and regional \(e.g. public galleries, libraries and hospitals in England and Wales\) between 2017 and 2019. These art exhibitions provided members of the public the opportunity to view dementia differently, illustrated by the quotes: “these works of art are a reminder that even difficulties we may face, and weaknesses we may have cannot overwhelm or overcome who we are as humans” and “a pleasure to see how dementia does not have to be a barrier to achievement”. 

####  Public Policy 

 The contribution of the Dementia Services Development Centre Wales \(DSDC Wales\) to advancing dementia care research is recognised in the 2018 Dementia Action Plan for Wales \[5.9\]. Bangor’s expertise led to appointments to the Welsh Government taskforce for Implementation of the Dementia Action Plan \(Windle\), and the Cross Party Group \(CPG\) for Arts and Health \(Windle and Algar\-Skaife\). Bangor\-led research featured in case studies and was cited as a research exemplar in an Arts Council Wales report informing how the arts are benefiting health in Wales, for a public\-facing campaign on arts and health \[5.10\]. Summaries of these studies were presented to the CPG and circulated by the NHS Confederation in Wales to all Welsh Assembly Members \(February 2020\). This led to plenary questions to the Minister for Health and Social Services querying how the Welsh Government is supporting the use of arts to improve health and well\-being in social care settings.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 With her unique profile as a Muslim female theologian and highly respected public intellectual, Siddiqui has reached a wide international audience through her work on Islamic thought, law, and ethics. The Home Office recognised her expertise in 2016, inviting her to chair an independent commission on sharia councils. The review, published 2018, was endorsed by the Council of Europe in 2019, shaping the current policy debate on sharia law and marriage. Its findings also persuaded the Home Office formally to support the Register our Marriage Campaign \(ROM\). Combining her research with contemporary political and societal concerns, Siddiqui has contributed a “brilliant, balanced” voice to public conversations on religion and society, bringing a deeper understanding of issues concerning gender, citizenship, faith and liberalism.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Siddiqui’s research into classical Islamic law and contemporary ethical issues has underpinned and shaped her impact upon government policy and the wider public understanding of Islam. In her 2012 monograph *The Good Muslim*, she reflects upon the rich discursive style of the Islamic legal and theological traditions, a style which Siddiqui argues has been lost in contemporary debates on Islam \(3.1\). Her exploration of key issues in Islamic law and theology has informed her analysis of the processes of marriage and divorce in sharia councils in England and Wales. In particular, Siddiqui demonstrates that the Hanafi  tradition of Islamic jurisprudence affords women legal rights in marriage and divorce but that social conditions frequently restrict the implementation of many of these rights and freedoms. In 2013, she gave a lecture at the university of Lund which focused on the challenges of defining public faith in western Europe. In the case of Islam, complex terms like sharia are wrongly appropriated to polarise political and cultural debates \(3.2\) 

 Siddiqui has also explored the interface between Islam and Christianity in an accessible manner that nevertheless represents a concerted scholarly effort to deconstruct complex issues \(3.3\). Her discussion of love and law in *Christians, Muslims and Jesus* \(2013\) explores the problematic \(mis\)interpretation of Islam from those within the Christian tradition \(3.4\). For Christians, the law is tempered by grace, but in Islam, the observance of law and ritual are seen through the prism of divine mercy. *Christians, Muslims, and Jesus* draws on selected Muslim and Christian texts to explore themes such as law, love, revelation, salvation, and sin. In doing so, Siddiqui offers a nuanced and perceptive interpretation of these two major religions in a way that undermines polarising and polemical arguments, thereby opening up possibilities for fresh and deeper reflection. 

 In an endorsement of *Christians, Muslims, and Jesus*, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams wrote ‘Probably only one person could have written this book. Mona Siddiqui’s combination of deep expertise in Islamic thought and long exposure to interfaith dialogue have produced a really distinctive and distinguished reflection on the Christian/Muslim divide that is sympathetic, courageous and immensely constructive for dialogue at every level …  It will be profoundly welcome – and challenging – for the faithful of both traditions’ \(3.4\). 

 With her research expertise in Islamic law and its reception within British society, Siddiqui was considered well\-placed to investigate the possible injustices caused by existing legislation during the Home Office Review into UK Sharia Councils in 2016.  Her published work makes the important claim that, as Islamic law encourages Muslims to abide by the laws of the land, the recommendation for Muslims to register their sharia marriages in a civil ceremony should be seen as a legal obligation. This proved a decisive consideration in the subsequent report of the Review.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Siddiqui’s research into Muslim\-Christian relations has received international acclaim for its unique contribution to policy change and public debate. A *Times Literary Supplement* reviewer wrote that Siddiqui ‘deserves recognition as one of the most imaginative leaders of contemporary Islamic thought’ \(5.1\). Acknowledging her reputation as a balanced and incisive academic, the UK government in 2016 appointed Siddiqui chair of its Home Office review into the practices of sharia councils \(5.2\). The first review of its kind, this was established in response to claims that some sharia councils were ruling in ways that deprived women of their rights under UK law. Siddiqui’s selection for this role was subsequently covered across UK broadsheets. 

 In 2018, the Sharia Review published its findings \(5.3\). Despite an open letter in which 200 signatories criticised the bias of the review body and predicted a ‘whitewash’ \(5.4\), the analysis and recommendations of the Review proved robust and challenging. The key legislative change proposed was that sharia marriages be registered under UK civil law, thus following Siddiqui’s argument about the religious obligation to abide by the laws of the civic community. The report was quickly welcomed by the *Daily Telegraph* as providing a ‘landmark’ \(5.5\) and its findings were endorsed by several commentators. Its recommendations received widespread press coverage \(5.5\). Writing in *The Spectator*, Tim Wyatt referred to the ‘damning Home Office  [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/678478/6.4152_HO_CPFG_Report_into_Sharia_Law_in_the_UK_WEB.pdf) by Professor Mona Siddiqui \[which\] identified “discriminatory practices” in the system and called for much tougher regulation of sharia councils’ \(5.5\). The intense discussion over the relationship between Islamic and UK civil law also coincided with high\-profile comments from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, whose 2018 book, *Re\-Imagining Britain*, rejected sharia in the UK. 

 Following the recommendation of the report \(5.3 p18\), the Home Office has since implemented an awareness campaign aimed at educating Muslim women as to the differences between Islamic and civil marriage. In 2019 the Council of Europe endorsed the Review, calling for new legislation that requires UK Muslim couples to register marriages prior to or during Islamic ceremonies \(5.6\). The findings of the Review subsequently persuaded the Home Office to back the independent Register our Marriage Campaign \(ROM\) which has the dual aim of raising awareness of the lack of legal protection for unregistered marriages and reforming the 1949 Marriage Act to require the civil registering of all religious marriages; this resulted in government funding for one of the ROM campaigns \(5.7\). In October 2019, the UK government indicated that it was still considering the legal reforms recommended by the Review. 

 Siddiqui’s public platform has grown extensively through her broadcasting and popular writing.  This is evident in her regular contributions to the BBC and other media outlets. These activities have enabled her to enrich and shift public understanding of Islam in the UK. In recent years, she has steadfastly condemned extremism through interviews and newspaper articles \(5.8\). Her inclusion on regular radio programmes, including BBC Radio 4’s ‘Moral Maze’, also testifies to the value of her input on a range of issues beyond strictly religious matters. She is the only Muslim – and sole academic – who is a frequent contributor to BBC Radio Scotland’s and BBC Radio 4’s ‘Thought for the Day’ \(TFTD\) which attracts a weekly audience exceeding 7,000,000 \(5.9\). After a TFTD discussion on homosexuality, Siddiqui received the following email: ‘I’m now crying as I type this. It’s so hard being both Muslim and gay – trying to be faithful to my belief and who I am … Your words were so beautiful and I hope they have an impact wider than little old me who is trying to keep it together in the kitchen while I get ready for my first day back at work after the summer holidays. Thank you so much – please keep on talking – this country needs people like you’ \(5.10\). The crime writer Val McDermid tweeted to her 39,321 followers in September 2016: ‘If one person justifies the existence of @BBCRadio4 Thought For The Day, it's the brilliant balanced @monasiddiqui7’\(5.10\). 

 Her core role in promoting ecumenical relations was recognised by the Church of England in 2019 when she was granted a Lambeth Award; the citation described her as one of the UK’s ‘most eloquent and articulate advocates for interfaith dialogue and a most cogent commentator on current affairs, religion and public life’ \(5.11\). Further, Siddiqui has become a go\-to figure in times of national crisis. She was invited onto TFTD the day following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France, as well as on the 10th anniversary of 9/11; her TFTD in the wake of Charlie Hebdo was reproduced in several newspapers \(5.12\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Lewis’s excavations, the first ever to target a disadvantaged post\-war council estate with no known archaeological sites or other evidence, generated new evidence about 20<sup>th</sup> century use of space, challenging negative orthodoxies about post\-war estate design. Involving estate residents as co\-producers and excavators, the research was shared with locals, wider publics, heritage professionals and planners through participation, talks, exhibitions, radio and CPD. Participation in the research excavations boosted transferrable skills, knowledge and social/economic/cultural capital amongst estate residents; the heritage sector gained new engagement strategies for ‘hard to reach’ communities including children; wider publics and planners gained new perspectives on social housing through learning about the social benefits of hitherto denigrated ‘Radburn’ estate plans centred on communal pedestrianised greens. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2016 Lewis expanded her research in medieval settlement development into new territory in the first ever archaeological investigation of a later 20<sup>th</sup> century council housing estate lacking known archaeological remains \(Middlefield Lane, Gainsborough, Lincolnshire\). In an interdisciplinary ARHC\-funded collaboration with UoL design historian and landscape archaeologist Ian Waites, Lewis’s archaeological research had three main objectives: \(1\) Establish whether excavation within a post\-war housing estate with no known remains could produce any useful archaeological data at all; \(2\) Analyse any pre\-estate archaeological finds in order to reconstruct human use of the area before the mid\-20<sup>th</sup> century; \(3\) Analyse any finds post\-dating the estate construction to see what these could reveal about use of space and residents’ lives once the estate had been built. 

 Lewis devised, co\-produced, supervised and analysed the excavation by estate residents of 20 one\-metre square test pits across the Middlefield Lane estate in 2016. This sampling exercise produced a large number of finds dating to both before and after the estate’s construction in the 1960s **\[3.1\]**. Using her extensive experience of archaeological test pit excavation in secular rural/sub\-urban settlements elsewhere **\[3.2\]**, Lewis noted several significant trends in the Gainsborough data, including an unusually high number of 20<sup>th</sup> century child\-related items. Her early on\-site observation of this trend was confirmed by Lewis through comparative analysis of her finds from 400 test pits from habitative settings elsewhere \(such as village gardens\), which showed Middlefield pits to contain four times as many child\-related finds. 

 Next, Lewis’ spatial analysis of the distribution of the Gainsborough data across the estate showed that the ten test pits excavated on communal, pedestrianised, grassed ‘greens’ produced more child\-related finds than the ten pits excavated in other types of space on the estate \(which included private back gardens, the infant/primary school playground and non\-pedestrianised communal grassed areas alongside roads\). Lewis drew two inferences: \(1\) the communal pedestrianised greens were intensively used for children’s play and \(2\) children preferred these communal pedestrianised green spaces above other outdoor space available to them **\[3.3\]**. 

 Landscape archaeology research by Waites and Lewis into the development of the Middlefield Lane area using maps, previous excavation reports and documents showed it to have been agricultural land until the mid\-20<sup>th</sup> century, with the estate built on a ‘greenfield’ site in the 1960s, using a new form of landscaped housing estate layout known as Radburn planning. The research showed that unlike pre\-war residential landscape planning, the defining characteristic of Radburn planning was its separation of people from traffic in order to provide safe, healthy, outdoor, communal play space for children immediately adjacent to their homes, and to enable residents to avoid vehicular traffic while moving across the estate. This accounted for the pattern seen in Middlefield Lane of residential housing facing onto pedestrianised, communal greens – the places where ten of the 20 test pits with the largest number of child\-related finds had been sited. 

 Interdisciplinary analysis by Lewis and Waites combined excavation\-derived inferences about children’s use of space in Middlefield with landscape archaeological analysis of the development of post\-war housing estate planning. Their joint published paper **\[3.6\]** presented their archaeological evidence showing how the greens had been used in the later 20<sup>th</sup> century, and challenged the assertion which had been made by some urban geographers, social commentators and policy\-makers that pedestrianised communal green spaces had been to blame for social problems which had developed on some of these innovative landscaped estates. Lewis and Waites argued that because the excavated finds showed the greens had, as intended, been used for children’s play and socialization \(and these locations had indeed been preferred over others available to children\), this indicated that rather than driving social decay, the pedestrianised communal greens had performed a beneficial and valued social role for local communities, by providing safe spaces for children to socialize outdoors. Lewis’ and Waites’ paper concluded by championing the need for increased provision of social housing appropriate to community needs, to tackle the housing crisis in 21<sup>st</sup> century UK. 

 Lewis has presented this research in academic fora in the UK, US, Europe and Russia **\[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\].**  The success of the Middlefield project in eliciting new knowledge about the past from sites with no previously known archaeological remains and engaging communities with no prior involvement with heritage helped support the development of an EU JPI project led by Lewis introducing test pit excavation in Netherlands, Czech Republic and Poland \(2019\-23\). C. 350 people had participated by the end of 2020, with the project still ongoing. The project is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(UK\) grant number AH/S006745/1; the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek \(NWO\) \(Netherlands\) grant 335\-54\-200 \(JPI Changing Environment\); the Ministerstvo školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy, Odbor výzkumu a vývoje \- 31 \(Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, Research Department 31\) \(Czech Republic\) grant number 8F18004; and the National Institute for Museums and Public Collections, Ministry of Culture and National Heritage \(Poland\)\] under Grant 020/DSAP\-JG/2019.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has benefitted ‘hard to reach’ disadvantaged communities by boosting skills, interest, wellbeing and social capital in residents; has built capacity for professionals in cultural heritage and in planning to benefit similar communities elsewhere using the Middlefield work as inspiration and model; and has increased knowledge about and interest in social housing estates and challenged negative perceptions of the value/heritage of social housing. 

 a. **Disadvantaged estate residents participating in the excavations developed skills, built social capital and improved wellbeing:**  Middlefield Lane residents helped develop and plan the project, carried out the excavations by digging the test pits themselves, contributed to national radio broadcasts and helped staff exhibitions in London \(2016\) and Lincoln \(2018/19\). The impact of this involvement was recorded through participant observation, written feedback \(feedback forms completed by 20 respondents each representing 2\-10 people on their test pit team\) **\[5.1\]** and audio and video interviews **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. The benefits gained are closely related to priority needs identified by ACIS \(social housing estate managers, including for Middlefield Lane\) in their review published in Service Insights, March 2018: employability \(skills, social capital\), mental health and wellbeing. 

-  **Enhanced economic capital from developing transferrable skills:** Self\-evaluation in written feedback showed 85% of participants developed skills in verbal communication, 74% in working to set standards and developing ideas, 95% in reflective learning, 84% in working persistently and positively and 90% in team working **\[5.1\]**. These are all transferrable skills valued by employers. 

-  **Enhanced social capital from meeting new people and enjoying working with the university**: Self\-evaluation in written feedback showed 80% of respondents enjoying meeting/working with others. 90% rated the experience excellent, 72% enjoyed it much more than expected, 90% learned something new about local history **\[5.1\]**. 

-  **Enhanced personal wellbeing:** Written feedback showed positive impacts in all five wellbeing pillars \(be active, connect, learn, be mindful, give\) \( [<ins>https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress\-anxiety\-depression/improve\-mental\-wellbeing/</ins>](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/improve-mental-wellbeing/)\) **\[5.1\]**, with comments in feedback and audio/video recordings \[\#5.2,\#5.3\]. showing positive impacts on measures such as community connection, place attachment, life satisfaction and self\-efficacy. 

-  **Enhanced personal wellbeing in children:** Physical activity, mindfulness and positive emotions were noted through participant observation of 164 children \(aged 2\-7 years\) participating in the excavations. The positive emotional impact is also evident their subsequent writing/drawings, which show frequent use of positive words, a level of detail indicative of focused attention having been given to the activity, and smiling faces indicating happy associations **\[5.1\]** 

 b.  **Cultural heritage professionals have new strategies for engaging ‘hard to reach’ communities including children and during Covid\-19 restrictions.** 

-  ACIS Housing Trust manage the Middlefield Lane estate as well as other social housing estates across East Midlands and East Yorkshire. Their community engagement coordinator Lucy Picksley witnessed the impact first\-hand and the excavations and the excavations and their community impact were reported in ACIS’ in\-house magazine **\[5.4\]**. 

-  Middlefield inspired the CAER Heritage project in Cardiff to organise a similar programme of activity in 2020 when Covid\-19 prevented planned larger community excavations. 131 individuals from 39 households plus 30 year 5 pupils from a local school input 1,710 hours excavating pits across one of UK’s largest council estates in July 2020. Feedback showed that 100% of respondents felt more engaged with local heritage afterwards and felt that the activity had helped relieve some of the boredom and social isolation of lockdown; 85% of respondents agreed that after the activity they felt more positive about their situation in general **\[5.5\]**. 

-  Participating in the Middlefield excavations as assistant supervisors inspired and informed staff Handmade Theatre in developing their ‘How Time Flies’ new production for children \( [<ins>http://handmadetheatre.co.uk/performances/how\-time\-flies/</ins>](http://handmadetheatre.co.uk/performances/how-time-flies/)\). HTF toured 18 venues in 2017\-18, with performances attended by c.3,000 primary\-aged children with feedback highlighting their new insights into archaeology/history from shows which were considered real and informative as well as fun. HTF’s success inspired ‘The Great Christmas Dig’ in winter 2017 \( [<ins>http://handmadetheatre.co.uk/christmas\-productions/the\-great\-christmas\-dig/</ins>](http://handmadetheatre.co.uk/christmas-productions/the-great-christmas-dig/)\). **\[5.6\].** 

-  The place\-based investigation of an ‘ordinary’ place and the test pitting methodology used in the Middlefield research underpinned workshops 9\-20 of the ‘Dig School’ learning programme, devised by Lewis to support home\-learners during 2020 lockdowns by providing structured online cross\-curricular workshops themed around archaeology \( [<ins>https://digschool.org.uk</ins>](https://digschool.org.uk/)<ins>;</ins>  [https://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/42547/](https://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/42547/) \). Workshops 1\-8 introduced general concepts \(evidence, place, interpretation, taphonomy\), then developed knowledge and skills to carry out local studies \(workshops 9\-12\) and then focused specifically on test pit excavation \(workshops 13\-20\), introducing methods and resources from the Middlefield project, with workshop 17 featuring Middlefield specifically. Dig School attracted >1,000 users responsible for >62,000 pupils in 34 countries and in evaluation was rated excellent by 71% of survey respondents **\[5.7,** 3 **\]** with 83% reporting positive emotional/skills impacts **\[5.7,** 9 **\]** and 94% recommending it to others **\[5.7,** 8 **\].** 

 c.  **Professionals in heritage and built environment are better informed about the benefits of Radburn\-type communal pedestrianised layouts.** 

-  Historic England promoted Middlefield research in ‘Heritage and Society’ \(2019,16\-17\) circulated to c. 40,000 professionals in heritage and built environment in local government and the wider development sector **\[5.8\]**. 

-  Lewis and Waites contributed to East Midlands Councils CPD training for local authority planners/heritage officers 16/1/2020 \(intended subsequent events cancelled by Covid\-19 pandemic\) **\[5.9\]** 

 d. **Wider publics have enhanced knowledge of and curiosity about the value of social housing estates and communal pedestrianised layouts.** 

-  East Midlands residents and visitors learned about Middlefield via public lectures, bingo\-structured talks, films, BBC local radio broadcasts and exhibitions. A multimedia exhibition \(including mock\-digs, posters, finds, film and bingo\) attracted c. 250 visitors in Lincoln’s Waterside Shopping Centre 17/11/2018; c. 300 at Gainsborough Heritage Centre March\-May 2019 and c. 300 at ‘The Collection’ Museum, Lincoln 23/11/2019. Written feedback from c.15% of visitors to the 2018 exhibition showed 90% gained new knowledge and 100% felt inspired to learn more, with free\-text comments showing the liveliness of the level of interest **\[5.10\]**. 

-  Across the UK and beyond, members of the public learned about Middlefield via exhibitions, films and broadcasts including: Jun 2016 manned exhibition at ‘Utopias Festival’ \(Somerset House, London\) \(c.15,000 visitors\); June 2017 BBC Radio 4 ‘ *Making History’* **\[5.3\]** c.800,000 live listeners plus more podcast; Nov 2018 BBC Radio 3 ‘ *Free Thinking’* broadcast on Thursday 15/11/2018.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 15 million people in the UK live with a long\-term physical or mental health condition. Research by Professor Andy Turner and Dr Faith Martin at Coventry University led to the development of several evidence\-based face\-to\-face and digital self\-management courses including the Hope Programme. 

 A social enterprise spin\-out, Hope 4 The Community CIC was established in 2015 to further develop and commercialise the Programme, through sales of licences across public and private health sectors. Nearly 15,000 people have benefited from the Hope Programme, feeling less anxious, depressed, stressed, more activated, grateful and hopeful. Its digital delivery scaled significantly in response to the COVID\-19 pandemic.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Turner and Martin have been instrumental in conducting self\-management research which has impacted on national and international policy and practice.</ins> 

 <ins>From the 1970s, the dominant self\-management research and practice has almost exclusively focused more on a person’s pathology and skills deficit. In the early 2000s there was a call for more research into the growing concepts of positive psychology and hope in self\-management</ins> <ins>programmes</ins><ins>. A positive psychological understanding and analysis of self\-management had not yet been well\-articulated and developed. Turner and colleagues were one of the first research teams to respond to this gap by developing self\-management interventions underpinned by positive psychology theory and practice.</ins> 

 <ins>Between 2007 and 2010 Turner developed the Self\-Management For Life intervention, delivered through the Health Foundation’s Co\-Creating Health national demonstrator \[G1\]. Two papers published from the Co\-Creating Health project have shown that people living with a long\-term physical and mental health condition attending a peer and professional co\-delivered self\-management</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>reported improvements in depression and anxiety \[R1, R2\].</ins> 

 <ins>Since 2010, Turner has been working with a range of NHS and voluntary, charity and social enterprise sector \(VCSE\) partners to develop, evaluate and</ins> <ins>commercialise</ins> <ins>a range of positive psychology theory\-based self\-management interventions, called the Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 <ins>In 2014 Turner was commissioned by Macmillan Cancer Support to develop a face\-to\-face and digital Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>for people living with and affected by a range of cancers. These were the first positive psychology informed self\-management</ins> <ins>programmes</ins> <ins>for all cancer types in the UK. A pre and post\-test study, conducted between 2016\-2017 and involving 56 cancer survivors attending the digital Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins><ins>, showed that cancer survivors report improvements including fear of cancer recurrence, depression, anxiety and cancer related fatigue \[R3\]. An adapted version of the Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>was included as part of an NHS patient triggered follow\-up service delivery initiative involving 251 colorectal cancer patients. Using a prospective longitudinal design showed that the self\-management</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>was found acceptable to patients, and would allow low, and some moderate risk patients to undergo five\-year surveillance without routine clinic attendance \[R4\].</ins> 

 <ins>The Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>has been successfully adapted for people living with and affected by a range of long\-term conditions. A 2013 study \[R5\] showed that for 25 people living with multiple sclerosis, the Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>led to improved scores in several outcome measures including distress, mood, fatigue and self\-efficacy.</ins> 

 <ins>Additionally, Turner was commissioned by</ins> <ins>Carers</ins> <ins>Trust Heart of England to develop and evaluate a Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>for parents of autistic children, where there is currently no UK evidence base for interventions for support. In 2018 a study involving 101 parents indicated improvements in depression, anxiety, and positive mental wellbeing. Changes in positive psychological constructs, namely gratitude and hope, predicted improvements in depression \[R6\].</ins> 

 <ins>Extending the research internationally, in 2018, Turner and collaborators from McMaster University in Canada secured $500k grant from Ontario Health Technology Fund to adapt the Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>for an international</ins> <ins>randomised</ins> <ins>controlled trial investigating automated remote monitoring and self\-management support among cardiac and vascular patients \[G2\]. This trial is ongoing</ins><ins>.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Millions of people with long\-term conditions feel unable to take an active role in their own care resulting in high use of health services. In response to this need, Turner and Martin developed a range of self\-management interventions building on the Hope Programme, a six\-week intervention co\-created to build knowledge, skills and confidence in self\-management of health and wellbeing \(activation\). Co\-delivered by peer volunteers and healthcare professionals, it uses evidence\-based activities including goal\-setting, gratitude diaries, and activity\-scheduling. 

 Impacts include: 

 1\) A novel social enterprise; 

 2\) Partnership\-working to improve patient activation, mental wellbeing and quality of life; 

 3\) Informing national and international policy; 

 4\) Improving wellbeing through creative arts; 

 5\) Enabling digital support during COVID\-19. 

 1\) <ins>Novel Social Enterprise</ins> 

 CU’s only social enterprise spin\-out Hope For The Community CIC \(H4C\) was founded in 2015 by Turner and four volunteer service users. In 2017, CU granted a licence to H4C to use and further develop Turner and Martin’s research for patient and societal benefit. The social enterprise has been transformational in scaling delivery of the Hope Programme, benefitting thousands nationwide. 

 From 2017\-2020 H4C co\-created seven Hope Programme interventions, licenced to public, private and voluntary sector organisations, generating income totalling £715K and re\-investing £20k of profit into its social mission. H4C employs four full\-time core staff and 20 consultants, students and volunteers \[S1\] and it was named in the UK’s top 25 social enterprises in NatWest SE100 ‘Trailblazing Newcomers’ Index \[S2\]. 

 2\) <ins>Partnerships for Patient Activation, Mental Wellbeing and Quality of Life</ins> 

 The Hope Programme has reached nearly 15,000 people to date. 

 Macmillan Cancer Support have licenced the Hope Programme since 2015, providing life\-changing benefits for people living with cancer and becoming a core service offer in 106 cancer centres across the UK. To date, 10,844 cancer survivors have attended the Hope Programme, with 1,066 volunteer and professional facilitators trained. Macmillan’s post\-programme evaluation established that 43% participants felt more confident to self\-manage, 46% felt their quality of life improved, and 56% felt less isolated \[S3\]. 

 Funded by The National Lottery Community Fund \(2016\), Bethany’s Wish \(2017\), EU’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme \(2018\), Children Cancer Leukaemia Group and Carers Trust \(2020\), H4C trained parent volunteers to deliver 46 Hope Programme interventions to 1,132 parents of autistic children and children with cancer \[S4\]. Our research has shown parents report significant improvements in depression \(68%\) anxiety \(40%\) positive mental wellbeing \(30%\) hope \(42%\) and gratitude \(21%\) \[R6\]. 

 In 2017, NHS England commissioned the Hope Programme to develop a new model of care for people with chronic illness across Devon. 106 volunteer and professional facilitators were trained and 107 courses delivered to 1,364 people, with post\-programme evaluations demonstrating participants were more activated and experiences improved mental wellbeing, reducing health service usage. In 2020, the programme was extended across the whole of the South West region as part of the NHS Long\-term plan implementation \[S5\]. 

 “The evidence\-base helps stamp a seal of academic rigour, authenticity and confidence in the efficacy of the programme. The public need little persuading that the Hope Programme is highly valuable.” — Head of Personalised Care, Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust \[S5\] 

 3\) <ins>National and International Policy</ins> 

 Turner’s research on self\-management informed a report on the 'Future of an ageing population' for the UK Government Office for Science \[S7\]. It has also informed the embedding of positive psychological theory and practice into design of self\-management interventions used by the NHS, forming the basis of several evidence\-based programmes in England \[S6\]. 

 In 2017 The National Academies of Science Technology and Engineering undertook a review entitled ‘Pain Management and the Opioid Epidemic: Balancing Societal and Individual Benefits and Risks of Prescription Opioid Use’, and used work by Turner to support self\-management techniques as alternative non\-pharmaceutical methods for pain management \[S8, p.91\]. 

 4\) <ins>Wellbeing through Creative Arts</ins> 

 H4C re\-invests profits into the community by funding events connecting research and arts for wellbeing. In the lead up to Coventry City of Culture 2021, H4C developed an award\-winning Gratitude Wall community art project \[S1\] bringing Turner’s research on benefits of gratitude to public. A large chalkboard Gratitude Wall toured 60 events collecting over 12,000 expressions of gratitude, boosting people’s happiness. It featured in the 2018 Universities UK \#MadeatUni campaign, bringing to life the impact of universities on communities \[S9\]. At another event a Writing Gym brought parents of autistic children together to express the emotional challenges they face through art and drama, with participants reporting increased relaxation and optimism as a result \[S1\]. 

  

 5\) <ins>Rapid COVID\-19 Response</ins> 

 COVID\-19 increased depression, anxiety and isolation for people with long\-term conditions, so in response Turner and Martin developed new research\-informed resources. H4C rapidly scaled its digital Hope Programme to provide innovative wellbeing support to 1,500 people between March and December 2020, who otherwise would not have received it. A new intervention for carers funded by Coventry City Council was co\-created, and delivery models facilitating use of VR headsets and online/offline were trialled to offer choice and accessibility. H4C’s work was identified by the West Midlands Combined Authority as a case study for excellent ‘innovation, enterprise and flexibility’ in response to COVID\-19 \[S10, pp.42\-45\].

 The Quorum project comprises research in the design, development and application of software and hardware that uniquely augments, evaluates and increases public engagement of cultural experiences. Working collaboratively with communities and not\-for\-profit, public and private organisations, impact includes: design of digital tools for cultural organisations to enhance cultural value metrics, increase engagement and financial value; digital curatorial techniques and audience engagement of the Tate; collaborative audience experiences in data driven immersive environments for the international Fulldome community; digitally enhancing school safe\-guarding and pupil engagement through the use of Artificial Intelligence; Innovating social change and community engagement through the use of data. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The deficit in meaningful methods and tools for data collection across the cultural sector, combined with the sector’s limited acceptance of digital processes, provoked a research initiative to explore the challenges associated with measuring ‘intrinsic’ as opposed to ‘instrumental’ value. This also exposed the ‘divide’ between the motivations and requirements of the funder and the funded, and highlighted an ‘innovation problem’ across the cultural sector in respect of technology adoption. The Quorum project was developed to explore and provide innovative solutions for these problems. 

 i\-DAT, led by Prof Phillips, is a research group in the University of Plymouth’s School of Art Design & Architecture. Quorum emerged following i\-DAT’s tenure as an Arts Council England \(ACE\) National Portfolio Organisation \(NPO\) \(2012\-2015\). Our response to the sector problems was to develop research using collaborative design strategies and technological innovations that filled the gap between governmental pressures and organisational capabilities, creating mechanisms to enhance audience engagement and participation. 

 This approach consisted of innovative participatory design processes coupled with digital prototyping, developing networked devices, apps and the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to augment, evaluate and increase public engagement of cultural experiences. 

 i\-DAT’s partnership with Cheltenham Festivals and Dr Eric Jensen \(University of Warwick\), secured a NESTA Digital R&D Award for the Qualia Project \(£127,000, 2013\-2014\). It developed digital alternatives, complementary enhancements and speculative innovations to exploit the potential of digital systems to deliver new mechanisms and metrics. Prof Mike Phillips, Dr Birgitte Aga and Chris Hunt \(Research Assistant\) employed a ‘research\-by\-design’ methodology to rapid prototype technologies for the four 2013 festivals which operated as a ‘living laboratory’ with the bulk of the research activity focused on the October Literature Festival, followed by system refinements and evaluation into February 2015. 

 The research generated a platform with a sophisticated API for data capture, processing and analytics, powering smile detection, geofencing and tracking, and sentiment analysis to calculate the ‘mood’ of social media. Shared with users and festival organisers the system generated a real\-time data model of audience activities. 

 The Quorum project was established to provide a broader framework to support the development of the Open Source software and methodologies developed through the Qualia project. The research was proactively shared across the sector through design workshops with Tate, BAFA Road Shows \(including Cambridge Literary Festival and Theatres Trust\), Cheltenham Festivals and the AHRC Creative Economy Showcase 2014. Subsequently, Phillips was commissioned by Jensen, working for the AHRC Cultural Value Project \(2014\) and Culture Smile \(£15960, 2016\), to develop sentiment analysis software to extend this research into digital methods for measuring cultural value. 

 Three Quorum installations were commissioned by the Tate to develop the Artificial Intelligence elements of this research for the DataJam, Turbine Festival \(2015\) and This Is Where We Are \(TIWWA\) installation for the launch of the Tate Modern Blavatnik Building \(Arts Council England £14885 and Tate Modern £12,500, 2016\). These attracted significant audiences \(25k in a single day for DataJam and 197k over four days for TIWWA\), incorporated projection mapping, robotic objects and Internet of Things technologies \(IoT\) to create intimate networked relationships between audiences and the algorithms that they were ‘playing’ with. The third Tate commission developed a high\-resolution interactive simulation for the St Ives Naum Gabo exhibition \(£7,400, 2020\). Phillips developed these IoT techniques into handheld devices for the *Murmuration* Fulldome performances at the Society for Arts and Technology, Montreal, Canada \(Phillips, M. UK PI. 2014\-2015. European Mobile Dome Labs, EU Culture Programme. Strand 1.3.5, Cultural Cooperation projects with Third Countries, €400k\) deploying the audience metrics evaluation techniques within a Fulldome environment. 

 Further iterations of Quorum included: Artory \(2015\-2017\), an incentivised ‘What’s\-On’ app, which was a city\-wide collaborative pilot produced by i\-DAT and Plymouth Arts Centre with the Plymouth Culture Guide Group; and Emoti\-OS \(£2,000, Plymouth City Council DataPlay award, 2017\) led by Dr Aga, a conversational AI, developed with and for Children & Young People \(CYP\) at Plymouth School of Creative Arts \(PSCA\), which questions if artificial systems can generate increased levels of awareness and empathy within a School. Participatory design workshops were carried out with stakeholders across these projects as a methodology to explore ethical, design, pragmatic integration, and subsequent audience/institutional behaviours and values. 

 Underpinning this impact is the code that has facilitated the collaborations and design approach. Distributed as an open\-source repository on GitHub, the original code base had 5 remote contributions, made forward contributions to 4 open\-source projects and was interacted with by over 250k people. It also was instrumental to i\-DAT’s status as an ACE NPO \(2012\-2015\) which engaged over 1.5 million audiences and 4,348 participants \(of which over 3000 are Children & Young People\). 

 These research activities have been developed, implemented and evaluated using iterative design processes which have included key stakeholders \(institutions and their audiences\) in a participatory process with research learnings being folded back into each new iteration or fork of the code, technology and specific research outcome and application.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Quorum is rooted in the research to generate meaningful digital tools to measure and enhance audience engagement for Cheltenham Festivals, funded by Nesta. It has grown through Artory and became threaded through the cultural fabric of the City of Plymouth, bringing arts organisations, their audiences and their funders together to release new funding and improve a cultural dialogue. The innovative methods and technical approach have helped to stitch together Plymouth City Council with their communities to enrich a civic dialogue about data and generated a new dialogue between teachers and pupils through Emoti\-OS. The same approach and digital tools have provided inspiration and a technological infrastructure for a new Fulldome venue in an area of multiple deprivation in Plymouth, which has already significantly transformed its sense of civic pride. It is now providing a platform for the Cornish regional cultural sector, switching a model designed to measure cultural metrics in city venues to a region where there is significant geographical distribution of rural communities, many of which have been excluded from a cultural dialogue.  The research has had national reach through its engagement with the Arts Council England, Tate, and internationally through applications within Planetariums and large\-scale projection venues, such as the National Space Centre Leicester, the Société Des Arts Technologiques \[SAT\] Montreal, the Fulldome / VR & AR Lab University of Applied Arts Vienna, *The Zeiss\-Planetarium Jena* and the Festspielhaus Hellerau in Dresden, all seeking to improve their audience metrics and increase audience engagement through innovative digital techniques. 

 Quorum research has engaged with the complex problems of measuring Cultural Value and Cultural Impact using technology\-enhanced methods in response to Governmental agendas, and delivered by non\-departmental public bodies such as the ACE. Quorum challenges traditional methods of measuring cultural impact and outcomes and supports the lack of capacity, especially within smaller arts organisations, to undertake the necessary measurements and data collection. The concern for the cultural sector is that artistic output is viewed only in economic terms using things that are easy to measure and ignoring those that are not. This presents a particular difficulty for the cultural sector, where value is considered to be ‘intrinsic’ and hard to quantify. 

 The digital tools \(software and hardware\) and participatory design approach developed through this research enabled us to develop a series of collaborations with organisations and communities of varying scale to create technological and methodological solutions that better fitted their unique ecologies and audiences, but that also generated new digital and data driven experiences, effectively turning the measuring of things into a form of creative participation. 

 **Design of digital tools for cultural organisations:** Through the NESTA Digital R&D funded Qualia Project \(2013\), we developed an experimental framework which enhanced the management of Cheltenham Festivals, developing more effective and real\-time audience engagement and evaluation mechanisms, such as sentiment analysis of social media feeds, capturing smiles, mood, accurate attendance information, levels of participation, location and flow of audiences. All of this information was relayed to the event organisers through an online dashboard to inform the organisations’ understanding of their events as they happened, allowing them to be more responsive in their engagement with audiences. This took the form of push notifications, more focused and demographically tailored information, sharing of captured information through visualisations and audio on the app and information booths, and the ability to make site\-specific interventions where the audience was clustering. This knowledge also allowed Cheltenham Festivals to better plan future events based on accurate flow of people when linked to factors such as weather and traffic changes. “ *I loved the fact that you could reflect on what your expectations of the event were before you went and why you chose the event and then record your actual feelings having attended. It really made you think about what you wanted to get out of the event and this will be a wonderful source of information for artists and organisations to gain a deeper understanding of their audiences*.” \[5.1\]. 

 Quorum research informed AHRC’s Cultural Value Project \[3.1\] \(2014\) and the delivery and design of audience metrics strategies through collaborations with the British Arts Festival Association and Tate \(Digital, Learning, Tate Collective, Exchange and St Ives\) to support their membership engaging with digital techniques. It was taken further with the development of Artory \[3.2 & 3.3\] \(2015\-2017\). Artory enhanced the marketing strategies of its 25\-organisation membership, significantly increasing customer reach. It secured increased funding by contributing to six of Plymouth’s successful ACE NPO bids, enhancing audience engagement through innovative embedded micro\-feedback techniques, real\-time information and incentivisation, and coherent organisational metrics reporting. ACE identifies the critical role this research played in the cultural infrastructure of Plymouth City: “Artory was instrumental in bringing diverse Plymouth arts organisations together to allow them to engage with Arts Council England audience metrics. The research produced technical innovations but also created a strong ‘social’ platform for audiences and organisations to have a rich cultural dialogue. It brought together audiences, arts organisations and City Council stakeholders and was cited in a number of successful funding applications to Arts Council England.” \[5.2\]. 

 This design approach led to a partnership with Counting What Counts Ltd to “create a palpable sense of innovation and openness around the whole QEFP \(quality evaluation framework project\), and generate accelerating public value returns for ACE and all cultural organisations involved.” \[5.3\], and their successful award of the ACE ‘Impact & Insight Toolkit’ \(2018\) contract which has been used since 2018 to support and report audience metrics for all ACE National Portfolio Organisations in receipt of £250k or more \(256 organisations in total \[5.10\]\). 

 ACE comments further “ *Artory…continues to be cited as an example of best practice and digital innovation for the culture sector and has been influential in the current Audience Impact & Insight toolkit \(led by John Knell\) used by Arts Council’s National Portfolio Organisations*.” \[5.2\]. This approach has recently been selected by Cornwall 365 \(10/2020\), Cornwall’s Cultural Tourism Network, under the umbrella of the Creative Kernow network, as the data collection platform for Cornwall’s diverse and geographically dispersed cultural audiences. 

 **Digital curatorial techniques and audience engagement in galleries:** Quorum was the basis for Phillip and Aga’s collaboration with the Tate, which built on these digital methods and the design approach to deliver work for the Tate Turbine Hall festival and TIWWA \[3.4 & 3.5\] installation, the first interactive digital work to be exhibited in the Blavatnik Exchange, with an audience of 197,000 people over 4 days. This has enhanced Tate’s digital curation approach: “The model of the ‘collaborative interdisciplinary ecology’ is one that Digital Learning has reproduced on subsequent occasions and is planned as the frame for future research”. \[5.4\] Led by Phillips, i\-DAT were further commissioned for an interactive volumetric scan of a Gabo sculpture, ‘Bronze Spheric Theme’ \(1960\) for the Tate St Ives 2020 exhibition. Co\-produced with Tate Digital, the adoption of these algorithmic approaches has opened new curatorial approaches in traditionally conservative areas of conservation, exhibition and curation. 

 **Collaborative audience experiences in data driven immersive environments:** Quorum’s networked devices and algorithmic designs for Fulldome environments were incorporated in performances at the Satosphere Fulldome in Montreal \[3.6\] \(2015\) to allow crowds to interact collaboratively with the projected virtual image, techniques which have enhanced the international Fulldome community by providing new digital tools for audience participation. “The ongoing work, as demonstrated in the EMDL production at IX at SAT, provides an innovative 

 template for the use of real\-time data for creating powerful audience interaction and engagement in Fulldome installations. The embedding of these initiatives into the fabric of the new Fulldome 

 installation in the Plymouth Market Hall will mark a significant step forward for the community, 

 offering new audience experiences and a new platform for creative production.” \[5.6\]. This informed the commissioning and design of the £7.4 million New Devonport Market Hall in Plymouth by providing methods, digital tools and audience engagement techniques, and ACE commissioning of new work through Phillips’ leadership of the ACE Montreal delegation \(£20,000, 2019\). The Real Ideas Organisation recognise the instrumental significance of Quorum: i\-DAT’s “ *cutting edge Fulldome research is inspirational, opening up the potential for new content, work and economic growth. It is the reason we, at Real Ideas, decided to raise £7.4 Million and establish the Market Hall as a centre for Fulldome development and enterprise in Devonport, Plymouth. The research informed the design of the technology infrastructure, allowing us to create experimental interactive data driven productions for this unique environment. It is an important platform for artists and performers closely associated with i\-DAT’s network and for the many other makers, technologists, entrepreneurs, young people and families looking to explore this area*.” \[5.6\]. 

 **Digitally enhancing school safe\-guarding and pupil engagement:** Quorum underpins Emoti\-OS 1.0 which was developed for Plymouth School of Creative Arts \(11\-12/2017\) and exhibited in the Tate Exchange \(01\-02/2018\): an emotive chatbot to engage 37,670 ‘emotional’ user interactions and 1,372 unique conversations in the period it was live. It enhanced the School’s safeguarding policy, enhanced social interactions and behaviours between pupils and staff and empowered pupils to express feelings and increase empathy. “ *For students there was a palpable increase in engagement where the young people had the chance to review their emotions in a motivating manner. It raised a consideration of risk and emotions in an interesting manner. It is impossible to take responsibility without awareness, this project supported awareness of safeguarding and risk*.” \[5.7\]. Nesta recognises the significance of Emoti\-OS by using it as a case study in the use of AI in the education sector, which has informed the sector’s engagement with its use as a tool to enhance learning: "" *In this model, insights gained from data collected by AIEd are combined with insights from staff in the school to create a collective intelligence, to enable decision making that brings together the views of students and staff*” \[5.8\]. Emoti\-OS was also presented at London EdTech Week by the Computing Lead at Plymouth School of Creative Arts as mechanism for empowering students, and as a viable alternative to a fear of the “mutant algorithm” often felt in the sector. “ *It became apparent that, with Emoti\-OS, we were empowering students to give voice to their feelings and, in many cases, giving them an opportunity for non\-human, non\-judgmental conversation*.” \[5.7\]. 

 **Innovating social change and community engagement:** “Following the Artory project i\-DAT was a founding partner in Plymouth City Council’s ‘DataPlay’ \(2015\) \[5.9\] and Quorum research contributed to the development of the city’s open data strategy to generate collaborations, conversations and workshops between data providers and communities, SMEs and artists. The coupling of our participatory design methods and open technological innovation has allowed greater access for numerous community groups \(such as Plymouth Tree Partnership\), Schools \(such as Plymouth School of Creative Arts\), and SMEs \(such as Elixel, Mutant Labs, and Controlled Frenzy\) to engage with the City Council and their data, which was previously inaccessible and poorly curated. This strategy was extended through geospatial models to produce real\-time urban simulations which have been used in participatory community conversations to inform civil decision making with councils in Cairo, Egypt, as part of i\-DAT’s partnership for the Cairotronica Festival \(2016\) and by invitation the University of Edinburgh Design Informatics Research Institute for the Edinburgh \(Cityscope Project, 2016\). As a result of the success of these techniques they were incorporated into the delivery of the Environmental Futures and Big Data Impact Lab \(£6.4m, European Regional Development Fund, 2018\), a collaboration with the Met Office and other partners, and part of the technical infrastructure of the Market Hall Fulldome installation in Plymouth as mechanisms to create greater civic engagement with the design of urban environments.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Entrepreneurial education across all levels and disciplines, both formal and non\-formal has advanced significantly through the research, practice and interventions of the International Institute for Creative Entrepreneurial Development \(IICED\).  Entrepreneurship is a priority agenda for policymakers across the globe, yet there had been acknowledged dearth of underpinning research for developing the competencies of creativity within the extant literature. IICED’s work has addressed this gap producing a body of research directly informing national education curricula and guidance in the UK, such as the revised Quality Assurance Agency’s Education, Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Guidance \(2018\), and the Welsh Government’s National Curriculum for Wales Areas of Learning Experience \(2020\). At a European level, this work has directly informed the European Union’s EntreComp: The Entrepreneurship Competence Framework \(2016\) as well as UN and World bank curricular developments in the Balkans. The work has also been influential in China, informing government directives to embed enterprise and entrepreneurship education into all Higher Education Institutions. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Based in UWTSD International Institute for Creative Entrepreneurial Development \(IICED\) Prof. Andy Penaluna and Associate Professor Kathryn Penaluna’s research has taken a global lead on innovation, enterprise and entrepreneurship education. It has challenged many theories of business education and informed the international entrepreneurial community on approaches for engaging and enhancing creativity in an enterprise context. IICED’s research has spearheaded international efforts to find new ways of supporting students and to equip them for the 21st century working environment, where flexibility and adaptability will be key skills. While developed in an evolving policy and practice facing dialogue with key institutions and end users, the following six publications broadly represent the underpinning research for the impacts reported below. 

 UK Higher Education had been continuously redefining entrepreneurship and related competencies up until the publication of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education’s \(QAA\) definitional guidance in 2012 **\(e\)**. IICED’s Director Prof. Andy Penaluna conceptualised and Chaired the 2012 and subsequent 2018 revision, following a national consultation. This was informed by collaborative work with the Creativity Research Lab in Applied Cognitive and Brain Sciences Program at Drexel University indicated that creative capacity could be enhanced through educational strategies that took account of micro\-molecular structuring in the brain through remote compound association, where differing types of brain activity contribute to either analytical or alternatively, insightful \(creative\) thinking \( **d\).** Using these insights, IICED have proposed different pedagogical approaches and devised new types of assessment metrics, for competency development.  The research is specifically designed to conceptualise new approaches to entrepreneurial types of education. It also provides a critical synthesis of where informed practice already exists, and how it can be collectively harnessed **\(c & f\).** 

 IICED research also includes policy work for the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Micro Businesses, consulting stakeholders such as entrepreneurs, small business owners, and national representational bodies.  This resulted in a proposed pipeline from school education, through to post\-doctoral researchers, which supported the development of Wales’ new curricular design **\(a, b\).** The Prime Minister’s Enterprise lead Lord Young used the research when setting up of the Careers and Enterprise Company for English Schools, stimulating more research at IICED on differing practices and approaches that enhance entrepreneurial capacity across different age groups **\(b, c\)**. Concurrently, collaborative research and research supervision for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \(UNCTAD\) focussed on the missing elements of entrepreneurial education that had been identified by IICED **\(a\)**. Working with the Chief of the Entrepreneurship Section at UNCTAD, research supported a better understanding of the abilities of knowledge harvesters who demonstrate capacity to seek out opportunities that others have missed **\(a, b, c\)**. This is especially important when research indicates that in developing countries necessity often overrides intention. 

 In order to provide some clarity for teacher trainers, the OECD in partnership with the European Director General for Education and Culture commissioned IICED to research and develop a practice and policy paper on a range of issues that IICED had identified **\(c\)**. This and the earlier work at QAA led to further engagement with the European Joint Research Centre, which culminated in the EU’s ‘de facto’ guidance document for member states \- the EntreComp Framework. EntreComp subsequently provided a platform to help develop Welsh Government’s new school curriculum developments, and IICED undertook two commissioned research projects prior to leading the writing of ‘Skills Integral to the Four Purposes’

###  4. Details of the impact 

 IICED The International Institute for Creative Entrepreneurial Development \(IICED\) was established in 2014 by Professor Andrew Penaluna and Associate Professor Kathryn Penaluna and has been described by the EU Joint Research Centre as one of the world’s foremost institutions in developing creativity\-based entrepreneurship education. IICED’s aim is to inform international best practice in enterprise, entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial teaching, learning and evaluation. The interventions detailed below have informed the development of entrepreneurship education in 42 countries. 

 **UK \-  Quality Assurance Agency’s Graduate Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Group** 

 Prior to the current REF cycle, but ongoing in the 2018 review and update, Prof. A, Penaluna conceptualized and chaired the Quality Assurance Agency’s Graduate Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Group \(2011 to date\) which developed the QAA’s *Education, Enterprise and entrepreneurship guidance: Guidance for UK higher education providers* \(2012\).  Following a proposal from the UK Prime Minister Theresa May \(letter dated 28/11/2016\) Penaluna was invited to chair the development of updated QAA Guidance. The revision drew on research reported in **a, b, d,** and **e**, and was published and launched in January 2018 **\(6\)** *.* At its 2018 relaunch, the guidance was described as a landmark document by the British Government’s Chief Entrepreneurial Adviser Prof. Tim Dafforn, while a joint OECD / EU literature review concurred **\(7\)**, calling it an influential taxonomy in the field. The OECD / EU review highlights the unique key aspects of the Gateway Triangle, first proposed by IICED’s Jones, Penaluna, Penaluna and Matlay **\(g\)**. The QAA guidance now provides the benchmark for all UK universities, and has also been adopted by Enterprise Educators UK \(for whom Prof. A, Penaluna is a Fellow\), who represent 115 HE providers, mostly Universities. The guidance has also had significant impact in European policy development with the European Commission and United Nations, and Internationally, with China, as well as in the Welsh national context, as detailed below. Later in 2018 Penaluna also joined the team of 13 authors that produced the Learning and Teaching section of the UK Quality Code for Higher Education. 

 **EU \- European Policy Development.** 

 Since Aug 2013 Prof. A, Penaluna has entered a period of significant engagement across Europe helping to craft the development of enterprise and entrepreneurship education throughout the continent. In 2014 Andy Penaluna was invited to speak at the EU Thematic working group on Entrepreneurship Education, and met with the EU Director General for Enterprise to discuss the QAA guidance and underpinning research **\(b, c\)**.  In 2016 Kathryn Penaluna keynoted at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on behalf of IICED, presenting research reported in **c, d** & **f**, and sat alongside the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility on an expert panel on youth and employment. Following this high\-level engagement, IICED played a leading role in developing the European Commission Joint Research Centre’s work on entrepreneurial competency development, published as *EntreComp: The Entrepreneurship Competence Framework* \(2016\) **\(8\)**. IICED were engaged in EntreComp’s development from outset, leading in areas related to creativity, future visioning and working in situations of ambiguity and risk.  The framework, which can be used as a basis for the development of curricula and learning activities fostering entrepreneurship as a competence, was launched by the European Commission in 2016. It serves as a key driver for the development of the entrepreneurial capacity of European citizens and organisations is one of the key policy objectives for the EU and Member States, and is set to become a reference *de facto* for any initiative aiming to foster entrepreneurial capacity of European citizens. EntreComp is now embedded into the European Union Key Competences Framework and accepted by all European Member States. It has thus far been translated into 15 languages while increasingly being used to inform and underpin curriculum reforms both in the EU and partner countries bordering the EU. 

 **The pioneering work in North Macedonia and the Balkans Region.** 

 Concurrent with the development of the EntreComp framework, in 2016, Eurydice \(a network of 43 national units based in all 38 countries of the Erasmus\+ programme\) reported that no country in Europe had fully integrated entrepreneurial education in schools and that teacher training was fragmented. However, supported by a successful bid the World Bank’s Skills Development and Innovation Support Project, North Macedonia introduced the world’s first compulsory and progressively evaluated Entrepreneurship and Innovation curriculum in 2015, following policy decisions made in 2014 at government level by the President, Deputy Prime Minister, Education and Science, Economy and Labour and Social Affairs.  IICED research informed this policy development and jointly led the project in partnership with North Macedonia’s National Centre for Development of Innovations & Entrepreneurial Learning \(NCDIEL\). The resultant ‘Methodology Matrix’ progression model starts with primary children who investigate who an entrepreneur is, right through to Entrepreneurial Leadership experience for those aged 17–18 **\(9\)** has now been used to teach an estimated 55,000 pupils. Concurrently, IICED were employed by the South East Europe Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning \(SEECEL\) to develop EU funded pilot entrepreneurial schools in Albania; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Croatia; Kosovo; Macedonia; Montenegro; Serbia and Turkey. IICED led the ISCED level 3 learning outcome framework and designed the entrepreneurial school methodology. By the conclusion of the project in 2016 in Šibenik, Croatia, 245 different teacher development plans had been produced by 2408 teachers, 44,314 teachers had engaged and 51,171 beneficiaries were recorded. 

 **United Nations Policy Development and the OECD.** 

 Other International work includes 8 years \(Prof. A, Penaluna, 2011 to 2019\) as an expert advisor on education to the United Nation’s Chief of Entrepreneurship Fiorina Mugione on the updating and development of their 37 country Empretec Program, based on the body of research undertaken by IICED **\(a\)**.  Empretec is a flagship capacity\-building programme of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \(UNCTAD\) for the promotion of entrepreneurship and micro, small and medium sized enterprises \(MSMEs\) to facilitate sustainable development and inclusive growth. By 2018 the Empretec network had expanded to 477,000 and based on UN figures, 160,000 had received the training by the end of that year, with increasing numbers suggesting an estimated total of 210,000 by the end of 2020 **\(1\).** The Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\) in partnership with the European Commission developed practice and policy documents that fed into EntreComp **\(c\)**, and Penaluna was one of 4 experts commissioned to lead the advisory panel that produced the HE Level assessment tool HEInnovate ‘EPIC’ in 2020 **\(7\).** 

 **Developments in East and South East Asia** 

 While IICED’s work has had a significant focus in the UK and European context, there have also been international impacts in East and South East Asia.  On 16/2/2016 one of China’s major state newspapers, *Guangming Daily,* reported that QAA guidance was the “most experienced…the world’s first national\-level guidelines on quality assurance in this field.”  An official Chinese translation of the QAA guidance was co\-launched in 2018 and the National Centre for Entrepreneurship Education in China is employing it in response to government directives to embed enterprise and entrepreneurship into all HEIs. Subsequently, NCEE China \(for whom Prof. Penaluna is Chair of Directors\) has been designated by the Chinese State Council as an International Distinguished Organisation and a formal agreement with Beijing Municipal Education Committee has been signed, representing a reported 1,200 HEIs. Similarly, in Thailand and with the support of Welsh Government through Big Ideas Wales a new Guidance Document for Vocational Education was developed based on the QAA work, with trials ongoing in 5 colleges. 

 **UK \- National Strategy Development.** 

 In 2013 the Minister for Education and Science David Willets invited IICED to contribute to a report on developing entrepreneurial education at all levels, which following research gathered via the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Micro Business, was published in 2014 as *An Education System fit for an Entrepreneur* **.** Further work with BIS / BEIS followed and culminated in Andy Penaluna receiving a Queens Award for Enterprise Promotion. He later joined the Enterprise Group under the Chief Scientific Officer for Enterprise, and contributed to the UK Industrial Strategy with advice on the potential for educational pipelines.  \( **a, c, g, e\).**  Other work related to the QAA guidance includes a guide on educator standards produced by the Institute of Enterprise and Entrepreneurs in collaboration with the sector skills body Small Firms Development Initiative. As QAA’s Chair, Penaluna received their educator award at House of Lords in 2014. 

 **Wales: Curriculum Development.** 

 At a devolved level in Wales, IICED worked with Welsh Government on forward\-facing policy drivers for schools in Wales offered insights that closely aligned to the evolving entrepreneurial education agenda at the EU level. This work followed Graham Donaldson’s review of Curriculum and Assessment Arrangements in Wales \(Donaldson, 2015\) and IICED was commissioned in 2018 by Welsh Government’s Curriculum, Assessment and Pedagogy Division \(within the Government’s Education and Skills Department\) to provide an audit/report on work completed and to propose a series of responses to the ‘Areas of Learning Experience’ \(AoLE\) teams who were writing the new curriculum guidance. The aim of the review was twofold: 1\) to provide an audit/analysis of how the Wider Skills have been embedded in the work produced so far by the AoLE group; 2\) to advise and suggest next steps for the AoLE groups as they continue their work.  Subsequently, Penaluna led the development of the central ‘Skills Integral to the Four Purposes’, which is to be used by an estimated 28,000 Welsh teachers, and is currently leading the Innovation for Head Teachers programme as part an advisory role at Wales’ National Academy for Educational Leadership.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Houghton’s participatory research with children and young people \(CYP\) has led to a greater awareness of support needs and a substantial shift in Gender Based Violence \(GBV\) policies, legislation, and services in Scotland. For the first time, there is explicit inclusion of CYP in GBV policies and action plans creating greater protection for CYP from harm. Specifically, Houghton’s research collaborations led to: 

-  Advancement in the Scottish Government’s “Equally Safe Strategy”, for the first time there is explicit inclusion of CYP, including revisions in the position statement, definitions, objectives, and priorities. 

-  Substantial developments in the Scottish Government’s “Equally Safe Delivery Plan” \(2018\) to now include new participatory approaches, services, and protections for CYP. 

-  Inclusion of CYP in the new Domestic Abuse Scotland Act \(2018\) including ground\-breaking “Statutory Aggravation” and “Non Harassment Orders” offering protection for CYP. For the first time the criminal law recognises the adverse effects on children of domestic abuse. 

-  Transforming practices for police officers, court officials, and service providers to improve service provision and CYP participation.

 2. Underpinning research 

 Houghton has developed a Participatory Action Research \(PAR\) model for working with young survivors of gender based violence \(GBV\). This model \(3.1\) seeks not only to give children a voice but also to enable them to exercise agency and power in policy\-making structures by engaging CYP in action research. Through this approach, Houghton works with CYP to examine experiences of GBV and to guide CYP in engagements with politicians and policy\-makers. Her associated participatory ethics approach \(3.2\), co\-developed with young survivors, has advanced existing research and engagement practices and ensures participation is ethical, safe, empowering, and emancipatory. Using this model, between 2015 and 2018, in collaboration with government and third\-sector organisations, Houghton led two pioneering action research projects with CYP and policy\-makers in Scotland: 

1.  VAV\-IMPACT \(2015\-2017\): Funded via an ESRC Impact Accelerator Grant and a Scottish Government grant, the Voice Against Violence \(VAV\) IMPACT project involved Houghton and young survivors of domestic abuse working with policy\-makers to set national priorities and embed participation of CYP in GBV policy\-making. The project advised on the inclusion of research findings in government strategy, specifically that: CYP are co\-victims of domestic abuse, interventions need to link the safety and support of women and children, and CYP need to be visible in policy and practice \(3.3\). 

1.  EVERYDAY HEROES \(2017\-2018\): Funded by the Scottish Government, Houghton \(PI\) led this action research project involving CYP from across Scotland working to research gender equality and GBV. The Everyday Heroes team consisted of CYP experts from the IMPACT project, Barnardo’s Scotland, Scottish Women’s Aid, Rape Crisis Scotland, and the Scottish Youth Parliament. 125 young people identified improvements to justice and services for gender\-based violence survivors \(e.g. domestic abuse, rape and sexual assault\). They co\-researched the justice system and proposed policy ideas to enhance gender equality. Working with the Scottish Youth Parliament, an additional 439 young people took part in a Scotland\-wide survey about gender inequality. Using Houghton’s participatory model 20 ‘Young Advisors’ co\-designed the project, its tools and analysis, and presented their findings to the Cabinet Secretary and senior policy\-makers at Parliament \(3.4\). 

 The Everyday Heroes project produced 29 key research findings including \(but not limited to\) a need to: improve training for police, social work and health professionals on supporting CYP in GBV situations; increase and improve access to services; redesign information and spaces; increase and improve CYP involvement in decision\-making about their lives; increase access to consistent specialist support throughout justice process; better implement the right to have CYP’s views heard and given due weight in decision\-making; provide robust training for professionals to improve early intervention and reduce trauma; and ensure CYP have choice and control over when, how, and if they have contact with an abuser. The CYP participants identified the importance of ‘speaking truth to power’ and recommended involving CYP in reviews, research, and evaluations that affect their lives, establishing CYP reference groups in the justice system, and increasing the participation of CYP in policy\-making processes \(3.5, 3.6\).

 4. Details of the impact 

 Houghton’s research into children and young people \(CYP\) and Gender Based Violence \(GBV\) affects thousands of lives. Despite issues of underreporting, Police Scotland recorded over 60,000 incidents of domestic abuse in 2018\-2019. In the most recent Scottish Crime and Justice Survey \(2017\-2018\), 62% of respondents who had experienced domestic abuse said that children were present during the most recent incident. Houghton’s participatory action research, which has underpinned numerous advisory positions and collaborative activities from 2015\-2019, raised awareness of children’s rights and experiences. Her model has been “ *trail\-blazing*” for bringing CYP into policy\-making processes \(5.1, Director of Justice, p.4\) and has led to a major policy shift to incorporate CYP experiences and advance policies, laws, and protections for CYP in Scotland. 

 Changing attitudes towards children’s rights and inclusion in GBV policies 

 Through the VAV\-IMPACT research project Houghton \(and CYP co\-researchers\) substantially changed policy\-makers’ understanding in relation to CYP and GBV. Initially, the VAV\-IMPACT project responded to the Scottish Government’s consultation on their draft ‘Gender Based Violence Strategy’ \(Equally Safe, 2014\), outlining how this version did not acknowledge CYP in GBV nor reflect their experiences and needs. Using Houghton’s participatory model, the project then worked closely with Scottish Government policy\-makers to share research insights and revise the strategy. The Scottish Government’s Equality Unit also contracted Houghton as an Expert Advisor to redraft the strategy and guide the Joint Strategic Board on issues of CYP \(5.2\). 

 These actions led to a significant reframing of GBV policies and the inclusion of CYP and children’s rights in national strategies and plans for the first time. The 2016 version of the “ **Equally Safe Strategy**” now included a definition of GBV that acknowledged that CYP *“are directly or indirectly harmed through violence and abuse perpetrated by adults in their lives*.” \(5.3, p.4\). Furthermore, throughout the strategy reference to “ *women and girls*” was replaced with “ *Women, Girls, Children and Young People”;* there was an entirely new section on CYP \(referencing Houghton’s research\) *,* two new objectives that specifically referenced CYP, and revised objectives that now incorporated CYP \(5.3, p.2\-4\). 

 The Director of Justice characterised the 2016 version as “ *significantly better*” than their earlier draft \(5.1, p.4\) with the then Joint Head of Equality Unit stating “ *Dr Claire Houghton’s expert advice and action research resulted in significant changes to Scotland’s Equally Safe Strategy. A revised version was produced in 2016 to reflect her project’s findings and the expert advice provided by both Dr Houghton and the young survivors with whom she worked. Dr Houghton’s evidence on the importance of including children/young people ensured both that the strategy was redrafted to incorporate a strong focus on children’s rights and that the refreshed gender\-based violence definition explicitly included children and young people of all genders as victim/survivors of gender\-based violence stating that children see themselves as victims of coercive control, acknowledging the harm it caused living with and leaving abuse and challenging the ‘cycle of violence’ based on young survivors testimony”* \(5.2\) *.* 

 The Scottish Government subsequently adopted Houghton’s participatory model to include CYP in the development of the associated **Equally Safe Delivery Plan** by supporting the Everyday Heroes project \(5.4, p.1\). The project’s collaborative approach ensured the findings were drawn upon to shape the development of services and actions. The final Everyday Heroes event in February 2019 involved numerous high level policy\-makers, politicians, and COSLA representatives across relevant policy areas who championed the research and its recommendations \(5.4, p.3\). The Minister for Equalities and Older People highlighted the importance of Houghton’s model, and committed to act on the recommendations, “ *both in government and in my constituency because we can see very clearly when we work with children and young people to formulate policy we get something that’s both motivational, inspirational and gives us what we need to move forward and to take those future actions that we need to change*” \(5.5, p.10\). Similarly, the Solicitor General committed to “ *taking the necessary steps towards implementing all of these incredibly important recommendations… \[including\] the specific recommendation from Everyday Heroes about **an online interactive platform**” \(5.5, p.3\-4\). Subsequently, in 2020 the Scottish Government commissioned YoungScot \(the national organisation for young people\) to co\-create this platform with young people, with Houghton providing training on her participatory model \(5.6\). 

 Influencing and co\-creating new legal protections 

 In 2015 the VAV\-IMPACT project also submitted a consultation response on the draft **Domestic Abuse \(Scotland\) Act** drawing on their research and experience \(3.4, 3.5, 3.6\) to question the inclusion of CYP protections. The project then worked closely with Scottish Government policy\-makers to feed research insights and findings into their work \(5.7, p.6\). The Director of Justice stated that Houghton’s participatory research approach and research findings made the bill writing team immediately rethink their initial approach \(5.1, p.1\). 

 Subsequently, from 2015\-2017, Houghton substantially contributed to this policy\-community by working in various advisory roles and formal expert groups. She worked closely with the Director of Justice to discuss the legal aspects of CYP in GBV \(5.1\), and highlighted children’s rights and experiences in key stakeholder forums, such as the Equally Safe Justice Expert Group, the Equally Safe CYP Stakeholder Reference Group, and a new Equally Safe reference group of children’s and feminist organisations on the new law \(5.2\). Through these forums, she worked with children’s organisations to substantially advance protections for CYP \(5.8, section 4.10\). The Cabinet Secretary for Justice acknowledged the influence of these stakeholders in the parliamentary debate and vote \(where the Bill passed with cross\-party support\) \(5.9, e.g. p.81\). As a result of this collaborative work, whereas the initial draft of the Domestic Abuse \(Scotland\) Act did not include any reference to CYP, the final version \(passed in 2018\) now **provides new and greater protections for GBV adult and child victims:** 

-  Acknowledging the harm caused to CYP through GBV. 

-  Introducing a new “Statutory Aggravation” in relation to children, meaning that any children affected by domestic abuse will be considered in the proceedings and the perpetrator held to account for the effects of abuse on children. 

-  Modifying Non Harassment Orders \(NHO\) to now include children. 

-  Supporting the inclusion of children’s views in legal processes. 

 The introduction of the 2018 Act garnered national media attention. According to Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf: "" *Scotland is leading the way with this ground\-breaking legislation, which uniquely recognises the effect of domestic abuse on child victims as well as adults*” \(5.10, BBC article\). The CEO of Scottish Women’s Aid described it as “ *fundamentally innovative*” and the “ *world’s gold standard*” \(5.10, The Guardian article\). The National Procurator Fiscal for Domestic Abuse stated that, *“\[The Act\] has a statutory aggravation for offences involving children and I think that’s what’s so important because for the first time it’s recognising that domestic abuse doesn’t just affect the immediate victim. It has a massive effect, a really devastating one, on children who can experience it. So the new act is really ground\-breaking in recognising the impact on children*” \(5.10, Scottish Legal News\). 

 Transforming professional practice and public services 

 Houghton’s research and engagement has led to pragmatic changes to the work undertaken by criminal justice public services: 

1.  Transforming how the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service understand domestic abuse, recognise children as victims, and acknowledge their right to be heard, through substantial revisions to the **Joint Protocol** with the police to change how police and prosecutors consider, engage with, and support CYP in relation to domestic abuse. The National Procurator Fiscal stated that, “ *VAV\-IMPACT challenged our thinking and practice about speaking and listening to children and using them as witnesses at court….In the first year of the Domestic Abuse \(Scotland\) Act 2018 being in force, \(from 1<sup>st</sup> April 2019\), 1,065 charges were reported by the police under this legislation to the Procurator Fiscal. A child aggravation was recorded against 251 \(24%\) of these charges reported and court proceedings were commenced in respect of 98% of charges with a child aggravation. If a person is convicted of a domestic abuse charge with a child aggravation, the court must record this and take this into account when sentencing the person. This legislation really helps to make the harm caused to children experiencing domestic abuse visible and enables the justice system to respond and reflect this in sentencing in criminal cases* \(5.11\). 

1.  The Scottish Government provided more than GBP800,000 to Police Scotland for training and commissioned ‘Safe Lives’ charity to **train 14,000 police officers** in Scotland on the new law, including the changes to handling cases involving CYP. In 2018, Houghton advised Safe Lives on the inclusion of CYP in their training processes and the charity has included her research findings in training materials including an online tool \(5.12\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This impact case study focusses on three interrelated shifts in curatorial thinking and practice at the National Gallery, London \(NG\): 1\) changes to exhibition programming; 2\) changes to display; 3\) changes to audience profile and engagement. 

 These changes were brought about through the planning and curation of two exhibitions, *Building the Picture: Architecture in Italian Renaissance Painting* \(2014\) and *Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece* \(2019\-20\), carried out by Professor Amanda Lillie of the History of Art Department at York in collaboration with Dr Caroline Campbell, Head of Collections and Research and Curator of Italian Painting Before 1500 at the NG. Both exhibitions explored the immersive qualities of architectural and landscape environments in Renaissance paintings, with the help of the digital technologies that create our current virtual environments. This bridge between images, environment, experience and technology has attracted different audiences and created new public understanding of the NG’s collections. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Lillie’s long\-term research objective has been to carve out an environmental approach to art and architectural history. Within this broad area, Lillie defines two distinct research strands: **extrinsic** environments, how Italian Renaissance buildings and objects relate to their settings, and **intrinsic** environments, the depicted settings within paintings and sculpture. The first strand evolved from a book and articles on villas in their social, agricultural, spiritual and topographic landscapes \(3.1\), including a study of the concept of the healthy building in relation to climate and a major article exploring the sense of place and sacred presence on a hill overlooking Florence \(3.2\). Lillie’s second research strand explores how artists assigned agency to air \(3.3\), water \(3.4\) and earth within their paintings and relief sculptures. Lillie set out her methodological approach to the non\-figurative parts of images in a paper entitled ‘The Rest of the Picture’ delivered at the Warburg Institute colloquium ‘Searching for Meaning in Renaissance Art’ \(2011\). With this series of influential conference papers and peer\-reviewed publications, a new field emerged, exploring both architectural and landscape environments and their representations in Renaissance Italy. 

 Lillie’s expertise in Italian Renaissance architecture, together with her pioneering study of artists’ pictorial environments, led to her major research project ‘Architecture in Italian Renaissance Painting’ for which she was awarded an AHRC Leadership Fellowship in 2012 \(3.5\). By asking fundamental questions such as why artists incorporate buildings into their pictures, and what roles buildings play within images, this research project created new interpretations of depicted architecture, showing how fictive buildings structure images in an experiential way and how architecture has agency within paintings. This research underpinned the National Gallery \(NG\) exhibition *Building the Picture*, accompanied by the NG’s first full\-length online exhibition catalogue. The conceptual framework arising from the research provided the themes for the exhibition: ‘Constructing the Picture’, ‘Entering the Picture’, ‘Place Making’ and ‘Architectural Time’, which then became the essay titles for the online catalogue \(3.5\). 

 From 2016 Lillie developed a new collaborative research project with the NG, leading to an exhibition on Leonardo da Vinci’s *Virgin of the Rocks*. The two strands of Lillie’s research led directly to her study of the painting’s extrinsic and intrinsic environments: the sculpted altarpiece and chapel within which the *Virgin of the Rocks* was originally embedded, and the painting’s depiction of a rocky grotto in an alpine landscape \(3.6, 5.9\). 

 The co\-creation of both exhibition projects was enabled by a successful research partnership between the York History of Art Department and the NG, formally established in 2010 by Lillie and Luke Syson, then Head of Research and Curator of Italian Painting Before 1500 at the NG. Within this long\-lasting collaborative framework, Lillie was invited to guest curate two research\-driven exhibitions that led to new programming and display strategies at the NG, which in turn attracted new and different audiences to the Gallery and changed the public’s engagement with and perception of the NG and its collections.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Three long\-term changes in curatorial practice were generated by the two exhibitions co\-curated by Lillie and Caroline Campbell at the National Gallery. 

 **The first impact is the changed exhibition programming** achieved by the way Lillie inspired the NG to explore new subject matter and interrogate paintings in different ways. As Campbell confirms \(5.3\), the innovative nature of Lillie’s research \(3.1\-3.4\) prompted the NG to invite her to co\-curate *Building the Picture,* a free exhibition held during 5 months in 2014 \(5.1, 5.2\). Rather than focussing on one famous artist or school of painters, the purpose of this exhibition was to draw attention to a new theme and parts of paintings that had received little attention – depicted architecture. This enabled the Gallery to see their own collection differently, opening their eyes to the presence of architecture in hundreds of paintings, and inspiring its curators to programme an exhibition based primarily around their permanent collection. The exhibition had 180,892 visitors and ‘received tremendous critical and popular acclaim’ \(5.2, 5.5\), with the international press praising its originality and drawing attention to the exhibition as a curatorial model for re\-interpreting a museum’s own collection. Freudenheim in *The Wall Street Journal* noted, ‘I was especially struck by this show as a matrix that might well have a life beyond its London display. Almost any museum with Italian Renaissance paintings could use this exhibition as a template to help viewers take a fresh look at its holdings. This exceptionally interesting and beautiful London exhibition merits attention as a model worthy of emulation’, while Januszczak wrote in *The Sunday Times*, ‘this is the way forward: the new way of collecting, the eco way – not by spending zillions on new pictures, but by getting to know what you already own much better’ \(5.4\). 

 *Building the Picture*’s impact on NG curators and the public led to further changes in programming at the NG. In stepping away from traditional curatorial interpretations focussed on artists’ biographies, chronology, attribution or iconography, Lillie’s work encouraged the Gallery to develop other projects relating architecture to painting, including their major exhibitions *Monet and Architecture* \(2018\) and *Impressionist Decoration* \(2021\-22\). This link is confirmed by co\-curator Campbell: ‘We now think differently about our collections and the way we display them, particularly relating to architecture, context, and environments, and better understand the possibilities available in programming these areas’ \(5.3\); and by Susan Foister, Deputy Director, who writes, *‘Building the Picture…* became a model for future exhibition programming in its thematic exploration of the environments of artworks, and Amanda’s research has helped the Gallery conceive of new ways of interpreting and exhibiting some of our key paintings’ \(5.5\). 

 The most far\-reaching example of this shift in programming was Lillie’s second co\-curated exhibition at the NG, *Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece*, which was focussed entirely around one of the Gallery’s most famous paintings, Leonardo da Vinci’s *Virgin of the Rocks*, and timed to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s death in 2019, with 64,171 visitors \(5.7, 5.8, 5.10\). Impact was achieved through the originality of Lillie’s approach to the painting via the intrinsic environment of its rocky landscape and the extrinsic environment of the sculpted altarpiece and chapel in which it was originally embedded. Campbell notes that ‘Amanda’s pioneering work and the success of *Building the Picture* \(and later *Leonardo*\) has contributed to a culture of greater risk taking at the National Gallery. We took a more experimental approach to exhibition programming and outputs…The success of these models… influenced the NG’s programming strategy’ \(5.3\). 

 **The second impact is the development of new, more immersive forms of display**, enabling the public to experience art \(rather than being detached spectators\) and to imagine paintings in the environments for which they were commissioned. These display innovations commenced with Lillie’s curation of *Building the Picture*, where the immersive effects of environment were explored through the exhibition design, interpretative wall texts, related images and short films. Encouraged by the success of this concept, Campbell notes that several of the NG’s subsequent exhibitions ‘incorporated these research themes and virtual/digital elements into their content and display, including *Visions of Paradise: Botticini’s Palmieri Altarpiece* \(2015\-2016\), *Delacroix and the Rise of Modern Art* \(2016\), and *Monet and Architecture* \(2018\)… Without our experience with *Building the Picture* and our long\-running collaboration with Amanda, the Gallery would not have developed these exhibitions in the way that we did’ \(5.3\). 

 The critical success of *Building the Picture* and of the display strategies it inspired gave the NG the confidence to build their first exhibition wholly centred on immersive digital experience, *Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece*, co\-produced and executed by 59 Productions. Campbell states that ‘The innovative elements of *Building the Picture* – the imagination of spaces, visualisations of that beyond the picture plane…  provided the foundations for *Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece* and its immersive virtual recreation of *The Virgin of the Rocks* in its original physical surroundings.’ \(5.3\) Based on Lillie’s reappraisal of the documents and comparable altarpieces remaining in situ in the Valtellina, the Gallery took a controversial decision to surround Leonardo’s painting by projected computer\-generated images, creating the first animated digital evocation of the extraordinary sculpted altarpiece completed in 1508. Since scholars, critics and the public are used to seeing *The Virgin of the Rocks* as a stand\-alone masterpiece, there was resistance to the idea of re\-imagining it juxtaposed with Lombard relief sculptures, and to projecting digital images around Leonardo’s original. Campbell noted that ‘We developed and employed models of digital/virtual engagement that were immensely challenging for our organisation’ \(5.3\). 

 As a display, the *Leonardo Experience* elicited varied responses: critique and dissent from those opposed to digital experiences focussed on old master paintings; praise for embracing the new medium; enthusiasm from younger members of the audience expressed through social media sites \(5.7, 5.8\). It also ‘received visits by gallery staff from around the world keen to draw lessons from the programming’ \(5.3\). Despite the risks involved in forging what was a radically new form of museological expression for the NG, the decision to recreate digitally the surrounding altarpiece had a positive impact on the NG’s display strategies. As Foister observes, ‘This digital experience – the visual components of which depended entirely on Amanda’s research – was the most popular aspect of the *Leonardo* exhibition among our visitors and has encouraged the Gallery to continue experimenting with new digital formats’ \(5.5\). The NG’s second immersive experience, *Sensing the Unseen: Step into Gossaert’s ‘Adoration’*, curated by Foister, has just been inaugurated \(2020\-21\) \(5.1, 5.3, 5.5\). 

 **The third impact is the changed audience profile and engagement** following technological advances on the NG website and digital engagement with a global public. *Building the Picture* was accompanied by the NG’s first full\-length online exhibition catalogue, mainly written and edited by Lillie, at a time when this was a bold innovation in museums \(3.5, 5.2\). Foister points out that the online catalogue ‘would not have taken place without Amanda’s AHRC\-funded research project’ and that it ‘constituted the important first step in the Gallery’s long\-term goals to develop its digital programming’ \(5.5\). The catalogue was shortlisted in the Apollo Awards for ‘Digital Innovation of the Year’ \(5.6\) and has been massively popular, receiving over 500,000 visits \(during the exhibition and the following year it received 462,607 page views with users visiting 2.1 more pages and spending 2.3 times longer on the site than typical; to Nov 2020 it received an additional 93,906 views \(5.2\)\). Freudenheim in *The Wall St Journal* commented that Lillie’s online catalogue ‘is a bold model for a museum to follow’, a view echoed by Januszczak in *The Sunday Times*: ‘I went home, got online and began reading about Building the Picture on the National Gallery’s website. Four hours later I was still there… the Building the Picture web experience ought to carry a warning on its opening page: “Beware. You could spend the rest of your life on here”’ \(5.4\). The five short films commissioned for the exhibition and produced by Lillie were also pioneering. Contributed by practitioners and theorists \- an architect, a filmmaker, an art historian, a film theorist, and a digital games designer \- these thought pieces opened up different ways of thinking about depicted architecture and, seven years later, are a continuing presence on YouTube, where they have received 91,046 views \(5.2\). As Nevola remarked in *The Burlington Magazine*, ‘the online catalogue will make a lasting contribution; with five short films – also available online… these resources will help to open up the research to a wider and younger public \(5.4\).’ 

 Extending the NG’s audience of younger visitors and reaching a global public were two key impacts of *Leonardo* \(5.7, 5.8\). The Summative Evaluation reports that almost a third of first\-time exhibition goers were young British adults \(16\-35\), and that visitors who were attracted by the immersive elements ‘had high levels of satisfaction and their expectations were exceeded… This experience led to many visitors thinking of the Gallery as a “modern gallery for the 21st century”’ \(5.7\). Campbell confirms that ‘The immersive and experiential approach of the *Leonardo* exhibition attracted a younger audience to the Gallery, and, as a result, influenced how the NG thinks about engaging younger visitor demographics. *Leonardo* demonstrated to us the ways in which innovative engagement tools can be deployed to draw in different audience groups. For example, we have focused on digital engagement for our December 2020 *Gossaert* exhibition, taking what we did with *Leonardo* and working that into a new form of engagement specifically aimed at the 18\-34 age group.’ \(5.3\) The digital nature of the exhibition also enabled the Gallery to plan engagement with much wider audiences globally: ‘we are currently in discussions with partners in China for *Leonardo* to tour several sites in that country in 2021, including Shanghai. This would not have been possible without Amanda’s research on intrinsic and extrinsic environments and the connected digital element of the exhibition, both of which allow us to take the physical and recreate it for new audiences many thousands of miles away’ \(5.3\). 

 Social media played a larger role in engaging the younger audience with *Leonardo* and in charting its impact. Comments on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter reveal the positive response of this younger audience, in many cases because this new demographic were engaging with the immersive virtual experience via another virtual medium: ‘it’s great, offering a totally modern way of looking at something that’s bloody old’; ‘such brilliant curation and clever use of digital tech’; ‘it’s wonderfully immersive, educative without being preachy… and shows that there are ways in which technology can be used to make pre\-modern art relatable for younger audiences’; ‘seeing the Virgin of the Rocks in an imagined altarpiece setting… was sublime and exalted’ \(5.8\). The NG received 78,000 new followers on social media platforms due to activities around *Leonardo* \(5.7\), with hundreds of thousands of *Leonardo* posts on Twitter \(1,114,822\), Facebook \(465,960\), and Instagram story views \(122,000\). On the new *Virgin of the Rocks* section of the NG website, visitors to Lillie’s feature on ‘The Lost Altarpiece’ \(5.9\) spent nearly twice as long there \(4 minutes\) as on other parts of the *Leonardo* web pages \(5.8\). 

 **The NG summarises** that ‘Amanda’s research and her collaborations with us have had a hugely positive impact on the National Gallery’s exhibition programming, curatorial strategies, and audience engagement.’ \(5.3\). The underpinning research impacted on the programming \(Impact 1\) which impacted on the nature of the display \(Impact 2\) which impacted on the changed audience profile and engagement \(Impact 3\). This momentum of three impacts retained the initial force of Lillie’s research because the intellectual trajectory remained consistent from start to finish: environments as a research field leading to environments both as an exhibition theme and as a mode of display that communicates immersively with audiences in museums and on their digital platforms. At the same time, the research trajectory explored through *Building the Picture* and *Leonardo* has fundamentally changed perceptions of the works of art themselves within the NG and in the world at large. In both exhibitions, the curation of environments within Renaissance paintings achieved a more immersive engagement, so that visitors could understand how artists use pictorial architecture and landscape as rhetorical devices, addressing them and inviting them into the picture, designing an internal narrative and mood, and channelling the viewers’ journey through the painting and their response. This visual immersion is participatory and experiential. As Wainwright in *The Guardian* commented, ‘The exhibition has a transformative effect… Building the Picture helps to open our eyes to why these stage sets matter, and it might just change the way you look.’ Cumming in [ *The Observer*](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/11/building-the-picture-review-architecture-italian-renaissance-painting-wall-to-wall-revelations) remarked, ‘All great exhibitions have the power to change the way we think about one or more artists. Not many change the way we think about art itself. But that is the rare and surprising achievement of Building the Picture’ \(5.4\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Over the past two decades, decision\-making in disaster risk management has evolved from a predominantly centralised, ‘command and control’ style of management to more ‘people\-centred’ approaches involving local participation. Northumbria University research has identified strategies for risk reduction of infectious diseases that focus on affected communities’ vulnerabilities and capabilities. Professor Andrew Collins’ research is now integral to the health policies of the United Nations \(UN\) Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction with 109 signatory countries and has guided the World Health Organisation’s \(WHO\) Framework for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management. On the ground, Collins’ research helped to refocus UN development practices in Mozambique towards enhancing community\-response capacity. It has also improved public health policies and hand\-washing facilities in schools in Nairobi, Kenya, that have contributed to reduced sickness, improved school attendance and performance, and increased personal responsibility for wellbeing in school children. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Under the auspices of the Disaster and Development Network \(DDN\) at Northumbria University, Professor Andrew Collins has worked with communities at risk of disaster across the world to develop new insights into enhancing disaster preparedness. Collins’ research has developed, applied, and tested the people\-centred disaster risk reduction \(DRR\) model with project partners in communities across the world in highly vulnerable locations. Collins’ research in marginalised communities has highlighted the lack of physical and institutional infrastructure in the most disaster\-prone areas. Top\-down DRR approaches in these contexts neglect to engage local communities and consequently fail to mobilise preparedness and response in the face of combined socioeconomic and environmental threats \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Collins’ research demonstrates the efficacy of embedding people\-centred approaches, catalysing community engagement, and maximising local knowledge \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Community resilience is empowered through self\-coordinated engagement and communication, reducing dependence on external support \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 Collins’ research investigates mitigating vulnerabilities through a focus on capabilities, specifically in a risk reduction context. Solutions co\-designed with local communities through responsive and innovative people\-centred methodologies reduce vulnerabilities to disasters and the associated precarity and long\-term risk of disease. Key components include community ownership of risk assessment. When risk assessment and management are governed locally and localised or indigenous knowledge is incorporated, then capacity is strengthened \[ **R3**\]. 

  

 Grounded in investigations of infectious disease risk reduction using hazard vulnerabilities and capabilities, Collins’ work includes the world’s first integrated infectious disease risk reduction programme based on DRR assessment and early warning principles established by Collins in Beira, Mozambique \[ **R4**\]. Collins’ research of Infectious Disease Risk Management showed that recognition of socio\-economic and behavioural influences, alongside pathogenic and environmental hazards, reveals risks that vary in nature from place to place over time \[ **R4**\]. In Bangladesh, Collins carried out a project to establish the potential of a health security approach to disaster resilience among people living in high\-risk environments. This identified the ways in which local, support\-led services can empower communities to develop resilience and organise themselves in the face of disaster vulnerability and respond better to the human security agenda more widely \[ **R5**\]. 

 Collins’ research and engagement projects in marginalised communities prioritise the generation of multiple types of data that amplify the people\-centred approach. There are significant difficulties in generating context\-specific data in marginalised communities. These communities are in most need of bespoke policies and practices supporting a local\-level response, drawing on local knowledge. This research challenges the orthodoxies that govern data collection by international agencies by promoting three types: numeric, narrative, and visual data. The term ‘action data’, coined by Collins, is targeted not on the top\-down application of generic categories for data\-capture, but on uncovering and recording the distinct experiences unique to the communities themselves \[ **R6**\]. Action data refers to data that effects change; this sort of data creates a voice that can be operational at all levels of human engagement in disaster prevention and response and forms a central pillar of the strategy for achieving the UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \(SFDRR\). Through this more sensitised understanding, action data reveals the specific vulnerabilities faced by marginalised communities and enables contextual, variegated, and bespoke responses that empower community\-led preparedness and response to both slow and rapid onset disasters \[ **R6**\]. Action data is highly valuable in extreme environments in developing countries to better understand the vulnerabilities of those exposed to disasters and therefore co\-design strategies and actions to reduce risks \[ **R6**\]. 

 This health\-focussed, people\-centred approach has been co\-developed by Northumbria University as part of its Disaster and Development Network with partners including: the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction \(UNDRR\), the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\), the United Nations Children Fund \(UNICEF\), the United Nations Refugee Agency \(UNHCR\), as well as local Non\-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\). Local communities and marginalised groups were supported to improve disaster preparedness through increased social cohesion, education, and sanitation \[ **R1**, **R3**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Collins’ work has embedded health and people\-centred resilience into disaster reduction programmes at the UN, including the WHO. This impact is delivered at the international strategic and monitoring levels, but also in terms of implementation planning, including laying the groundwork for generating the needed contextual data in the most at\-risk communities. Impact is also felt on the ground in Mozambique and Kenya where work with the UN Development Programme \(UNDP\) and international NGO, No Strings International, has seen the people\-centred approach to local environment and health resilience implemented in vulnerable communities. This approach built on existing local knowledge and enhanced community responsiveness, including new public health policies, teacher training, and hand\-washing facilities in Nairobi schools. 

 **4.1 Embedding health in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction** 

 The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \(SFDRR\) is the UN’s framework for disaster risk reduction, adopted in 2015. It replaced the Hyogo Framework for Action \(HFA\) which was in place between 2005 and 2015. The adoption of SFDRR marks the first time that the fields of health and disaster risk management were substantially interwoven at the global, multisectoral policy level. Collins’ research findings have directly informed the SFDRR by placing a people\-centred and community\-empowering approach to health at the heart of the UN’s DRR response. Through research\-led ‘ *expert contributions*’ to ‘ *stakeholder consultations and the Sendai Framework negotiations*’ and providing ‘ *a key voice for people and public health in the Science and Technology Advisory Group of the UN Office for DRR’* Collins’ research has *‘helped to ensure that health was central to the final agreed text of the SFDRR 2015\-2030*’ \[ **E1**\]. Jonathon Abrahams, Officer for Health Policy in DRR at the WHO, who coordinated the UN process of putting health at the centre of the Sendai Framework, explains, ‘ *there is a clear focus in the Sendai framework principles of a people\-centred and inclusive approach which has been at the core of Professor Collins’ work which has served as a continual reminder to focus on action at the local level*’ \[ **E1**\]. In the foreword to the SFDRR, Margareta Wahlström, Former United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary\-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, notes that a focus on health resilience is one of the ‘ *significant shifts’* as the SFDRR replaces the HFA \[ **E2**, p4\]. Health is ‘ *strongly promoted throughout’* \[ **E2**, p4\] but one of the seven targets of the SFDRR is to ‘ *Substantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services, among them health and educational facilities, including through developing their resilience by 2030’* \[ **E2**, p11, target d\]. 

 Collins’ work has guided development of the WHO’s Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management \(HEDRM\) Framework which is designed to deliver on the SFDRR commitments. Abrahams, in coordinating Health Policy in DRR at the WHO, says, ‘ *Collins has been an instrumental member of the core group that has taken forward the WHO Thematic Platform for HEDRM’* and developed the HEDRM Framework in 2019. This Framework, with 194 countries committed to its rules, ‘ *provides guidance to ministries of health and … multisectoral health stakeholders on the functions required to reduce the risks and consequences of emergencies and disasters*’ \[ **E1**\]. 

 195 countries are required to report on progress against the SFDRR annually. In addition to guiding the health policy of the SFDRR, Mami Mizutori, the current Special Representative for UNDRR to the Secretary General, explains the importance of Collins’ ongoing role in the Framework’s successful execution, saying, his ‘ *engagement and thought leadership in this critical phase of the implementation of the Sendai Framework in close coherence with the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Climate Agreement has helped lay the ground for UNDRR and our partners to better promote and support risk\-informed decision\-making and investment across all 2030 agendas’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 In 2019, the UNDRR commissioned Collins to write a report on the uses of action data in DRR to enhance the capacity of international agencies and local communities to deliver the appropriate data that underpins the most effective responses to disaster risk \[ **E4**\]. Ricardo Mena, Director of UN Office for DRR, explains Collins worked closely with his office ‘ *to apply his research findings on Action Data and significant project experience*’ into this report, and that this ‘ *policy document provides the framework for the UNDRR Science and Technology Advisory Group \(STAG\) Data Working Group, a key element of the Sendai Framework implementation*’ \[ **E5**\]. As a result, there is now a ‘ *new emphasis on Action Data at the heart of the ongoing implementation and monitoring of the Sendai Framework*’ \[ **E5**\]. 

 **4.2 Implementing a people\-centred approach in vulnerable communities** 

 To support implementation of community capacity enhancement policies on the ground, Collins has worked closely with the UN Development Programme \(UNDP\) in Mozambique. Dr Titus Kuuyuor, Chief Technical Advisor for DRR/Climate Change Adaptation at UNDP for Mozambique, confirms that Collins’ research and research\-informed expertise has addressed challenges the UNDP and other development agencies face at the community level. Dr Kuuyuor explains: ‘ *most agencies, including UNDP, are based in Maputo and \[are\] unable to provide ongoing capacity development and advice due to the distances involved, exacerbated by the high staff turnover*’ \[ **E6**\]. Collins’ research on locally informed responses and capacity led to community volunteers serving on Local Risk Management Boards, creating *‘an important link between community level disaster risk management and government’* and changing UNDP policy towards *‘enhancing community knowledge and skills in preparedness and planning and developing early warning systems’* \[ **E6**\]. As Dr Kuuyuor puts it: ‘ *after working with Collins … we refocused our capacity\-strengthening initiatives on different scales and … working with local officials in communities is proving far more effective for embedding resilience to disasters*’ \[ **E6**\]. 

 Beyond the UN, Collins has worked with NGOs directly embedded within communities to enhance their locally led response capacity, engaging with Collins’ research and expert advice on local resilience to implement child\-led approaches to risk communication \[ **E7**\]. No Strings International \(NSI\), an NGO working internationally to improve children’s health and hygiene, ‘ *revised \[their\] practices towards a child\-centred risk reduction approach in Nairobi*’ \[ **E7**, p2\]. Rosie Waller, Programme Manager for NSI, explains that the application of the child\-centred approach has helped with ‘ *engaging the children, getting them excited to learn about hand\-washing, and embed best hygiene practices in school and taking those lessons home to share with their family*’ \[ **E7**, p2\]. NSI work in five schools in Nairobi taught hand\-washing and good hygiene to all pupils aged 6 to 15. They use puppetry, interactive crafts, and performance activities to engage and place children at the centre of the learning experience \[ **E8**\]. This approach has urged greater responsibility than is customary in classrooms, embedding the children as agents of change for risk reduction while at the same time heightening their awareness of personal wellbeing \[ **E7**\]. The Ministry of Education have since adopted this approach, *‘there is now an emphasis on child\-centred methodologies or strategies, which helps the children to absorb more of what they are taught … these \[new methodologies\] are passed on to the master trainers who train TOT's \(Trainers of Trainers\), who then train the teachers. When you have trained teachers, you have trained children*’ \[ **E7**, p7\]. In addition, children practice this at home *‘so the whole community are now affected*’ \[ **E7**, p11\]. To spread these benefits of child\-centred learning, ‘ *public health strategy is now to train the teachers and school health club together with the head of the school and the school management committee, which includes parents … due to this there is a lot of improvement*’ \[ **E7**, p12\]. Successes have been rewarded by an expansion in classroom sanitation facilities: *‘If you go to the schools now, water points are in almost all of the schools and being used correctly’* \[ **E7**, p8\]. Erik Inda, the Public Health Hygiene Coordinator for 2,500 schools in Nairobi, has ‘ *seen a measurable decrease in faecal and related diseases at the class level*’ where these projects have run \[ **E7**, p5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The city of Portsmouth, dominated by its naval dockyard, has traditionally celebrated and commemorated the achievements of men, and was considered little touched by feminism. However, the research expertise of Dr Sue Bruley and Dr Laurel Forster, in collaboration with local community groups, has led to the rediscovery of a history of feminist campaigning since the 1960s. With Heritage Lottery Fund support, this project has had a positive impact upon its participants, the local community and a global audience. The women whose stories are now preserved forever have experienced validation and increased self\-esteem. Wider groups who attended events and participated in the project now have a changed and better\-informed understanding of this history. And a growing global audience, increasingly able to access this new record through archive availability and online media, is being educated and inspired to action by the potential power of ordinary women’s life narratives and grassroots activism.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The academic expertise of Bruley and Forster, demonstrated in research over a period of twenty years on British social and media narratives, has contributed to a substantial revision of the history of the British Women’s Liberation Movement \(WLM\). Earlier accounts of the WLM tended to address the well\-known feminists of the movement, and with a focus upon London\-centric activism. This newly\-uncovered feminist history redresses that balance and draws attention to the second\-wave activism of local women, facing local issues. 

 Bruley’s research has developed over an extensive career, initially focussed upon women’s history of the first half of the twentieth century, where it addressed topics including women’s life\-narration in the Second World War, and the contested history of labour and community activism in the mining towns of South Wales. Her later work \(2013\-2017\) on second\-wave feminism has brought to attention ways in which feminism was present and embedded in towns across the United Kingdom \(R5\). Bruley has worked with local networks and archives to highlight regional feminist communities in English towns, and her research offers a new understanding of the negotiations necessary for localised feminist activism \(R2\). As part of her research, Bruley has formed a ground\-breaking analysis of a dispersed feminism as a political phenomenon of the later twentieth century, and the significance of consciousness\-raising as an important contributing factor in this feminist process \(R1\). Throughout this work, Bruley’s use of oral\-history methodology has brought to light information and understandings that would otherwise have been hidden from conventional textual research. 

 Forster’s research specialism in feminist media histories, women’s writing and narratives, and the representation of everyday women in the media, has brought both specific and wider context to the project \(R6\). Her 2015 writings on periodicals and broadcast magazines explore diverse implications and influences of women’s media \(R3\). In particular, her research into the reporting of WLM activism enabled the project to identify national campaigns and issues, and to transpose these onto a local investigation. Her interviews and research concerning a local Southern Television programme, *Houseparty*, which facilitated women’s conversation, and interests, brought understanding of regionality and individual feminisms to the project \(R4\). 

 As feminist scholars, Bruley and Forster are committed to the necessary and productive overlap of academic and community approaches to history. Thus their first engagement with the specific story of Portsmouth and the WLM was a 2014 Portsmouth University conference: ‘Situating Women’s Liberation: Historicising a Movement’, convened by Bruley with Forster and Professor June Purvis. This built upon the three organisers’ substantial research on the first and second ‘waves’ of feminism and their associations with the national Women’s History Network. The conference welcomed local women as well as expert academic speakers. Non\-academics were encouraged to address the whole conference and talk about their personal engagement with female politics. The academic papers were published in the peer\-reviewed journal, *Women’s History Review \(WHR\)*, and this special edition has become a standard resource, with subsequent republication as hardback book \(Routledge, 2018\), paperback, and kindle versions \(December 2020\). Significant community enthusiasm for a local history project, focussed upon Portsmouth women, was evident from the conference. This began a process of structured collaboration, detailed in Section 4, which would become the Heritage Lottery Fund \(HLF\)\-supported project \(G1\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Bruley and Forster’s findings began with the community and activist response generated by the 2014 conference. Bruley and Forster guided and encouraged participation in a ‘Women’s Liberation Witness Day’ \(June 2015\), and five further ‘Witness’ meetings \(2015\-2017\), which brought together local ex\-activists to talk about their experiences in a public forum. As women gave voice to their personal testimonies, other long\-forgotten activisms and fellow female campaigners were remembered. Word of mouth through Portsmouth’s tight\-knit community, led to a proliferation of individuals, campaign leaders and supporters of marginalised groups to be interviewed. 

 Bruley and Forster considered these early testimonials when preparing the HLF bid. Based on the findings of their own research, they devised a way of transposing individual life stories onto more general struggles women faced living and working in a naval city, and then onto even broader national WLM concerns. They formed partnerships with the city’s history centre, schools, community centres, and the University of the Third Age \(U3A\) Portsdown branch, to continue the work. Bruley and Forster sought advice from other academics and extended the reach of the project. They contacted women’s ethnic minority groups in the city, involved the local council, reached out to a range of women’s campaigning groups \(concerned with issues from pensions to plastics\) and harnessed the strong city interest in local history. 

 The successful HLF grant bid \(G1, awarded December 2017, GBP76,000\) was entirely dependent on the convincing combination of Bruley and Forster’s initial research findings, their joint expertise, and the array of groups they had brought together to endorse its aims. The grant supported a committee of academics and local partners, and enabled a permanent voice to be given to female activists, creating an official record of the pioneering work of local women. Moreover, this project piloted a new methodology for engaging marginalised and underrepresented women's groups and local female activists. This involved training over 20 younger volunteers in interview techniques and Oral History practice, enabling them to interview nearly 60 older feminists, activists and women’s groups. This brought about cross\-generational and cross\-cultural understanding. Additionally, volunteers from the U3A assisted with archiving for the City’s History Centre. Such cascading of skills involved public bodies, local groups and interested individuals. 

 The project, with over 20 public talks, training events, community\-centre visits and touring exhibitions, has rekindled interest in, and reawakened awareness of,  a feminist history of late\-twentieth\-century Portsmouth. Lectures, ‘memory days’, touring exhibitions of the ‘talking table’, and a ‘teachers’ pack’, enabled local communities to hear these new narratives. This project has catalysed a shift in understanding and placed women’s pioneering action at the forefront of Portsmouth’s history. Not only has the lived experience of the city’s women been retrieved from the shadow of a male\-dominated conventional history, but further layers have been added to it, revealing a multi\-cultural history, paving the way for current generations to see their home city in a new, more inspiring light. 

 <ins> **Increasing Awareness of Women’s Activism**</ins> 

 The general programme of public lectures and informal events at various city venues, attracted audiences of up to 150, included women and men, age ranges of 8 to 80, with professional and amateur interest in local history. Attendees reported learning *“A huge amount”* \[text removed for publication\], with some expressing an intention to continue the work: *“I’ll definitely be following up with some research of my own”*. Older attendees, such as \[text removed for publication\], appreciated the recovered narratives which *“brought back many memories and changes in society during my life \[...\] Children need to know this social history”.* These events also inspired future women’s activism, as teenager \[text removed for publication\] said: *“The lecture was extremely inspirational as it teaches women to stand up for their rights”* \(S6\). 

 \[Text removed for publication\], a local councillor, said: *“The booklet taught me incredible amounts. Also the diverse range of women. \[...\] The story about CND being a major presence in Pompey blew my mind.”* Cross\-generational education of women’s activism was evidenced, as \[text removed for publication\] explained how: *“My daughter \(11\) and son \(18\) \[...\] were really impacted by all the stories and what women have done to improve life in our city. And impacted by CND and Mums being arrested\!\!”* Augmented perceptions of Portsmouth women’s contributions are now a valued cultural history. \[Text removed for publication\] noted: *“I found it both interesting and reassuring to hear of the project and its importance to those taking part \[...\] it should be a more important part of Pompey history  \[...\] at the City Museum or a display at the Guildhall or other public places”* \(S6\). 

 <ins> **Enhancing Skills and Dialogue in Gathering Women’s Narratives**</ins> 

 As part of the Project methodology, younger women were trained to interview older women. As well as providing concrete upskilling for this group, it also promoted intergenerational dialogue, and delivered a stimulus to further reflection. \[Text removed for publication\] commented: *“It’s a really interesting project and I think that it’s something necessary for every community”* \(S6\). All learnt new interviewing techniques, \[text removed for publication\] said, *“I’m excited about learning new skills”,* and went on to attend the oral training and videoing skills courses too \(S6\). Indrani Krishan was impressed by the achievements of women: *“Each of them has different abilities, and they have accomplished their dream and stand as a woman”* and was pleased to extend her skillset: *“this event increases my knowledge of qualitative methods. As a PhD research student, I have learnt the techniques to conduct the focus group discussion, and it benefits me in the near future”* \(S5\). 

 <ins> **Augmenting Women’s Self\-esteem and Social Acknowledgement**</ins> 

 It was important to capture and record stories of women’s activism before these first\-hand accounts were lost forever. Acknowledging women’s rights campaigning and battles for local improvements has elevated the self\-esteem of older women, whose work traditionally took second place to men’s. Interviewee Pat Smith reflected upon her newly\-awoken comprehension of her working life in the context of the national picture of women battling sex discrimination in the workplace: *“This project \[...\] had a profound impact on me, a realisation of how far I have come personally and professionally since I first started work in 1977. \[...\] It has helped me to understand what discrimination means in the workplace and in life. It also made me feel very proud to be amongst other pioneering women, who lived in Portsmouth”* \(S5\).  The Project has had a broader impact too, as dispersed families have now understood, with great pride, the role played by their older female relatives. \[Text removed for publication\] noted: *“It has been great for my family \(living in different continents\) to celebrate our Mum’s story”* \(S6\). Such pride was especially clear in the ‘Testimonial Video’, which articulates how the Project empowered its participants \(S2\). 

 Interviewees have achieved recognition through autobiographical testimonies and understanding of their position in society. Rosy Bremer, a 1980s Greenham common activist, observed: *“the only other time I have spoken about the work I did \[...\] was when I was being prosecuted and sent to prison. \[...\] I would be happy to think that children growing up in Portsmouth might be able to learn about some of the reasons people might oppose the military's actions against people in other countries. These opinions are little represented in the city. \[...\] The project definitely benefited me by benefiting the community and the city in which I live. Stories which were previously known to only a few women now have a greater chance of being told and being heard”* \(S5\). 

 <ins> **Extending Awareness of Ethnic Diversity**</ins> 

 An unexpected but very welcome outcome of the project has been a hugely positive impact upon a number of minority groups in the Portsmouth area, including Chinese wives and Bangladeshi daughters \(S4\). The diversity of women’s lives and contributions in Portsmouth has achieved greater visibility, significance and acknowledgement. The testimony of Marie Costa, of the Nigerian Ebo people, chair of the Portsmouth African Women’s Forum, demonstrates how vital the collaborative nature of the project was to achieving this: *“At first, we thought that this project has ‘nothing’ for us \[...\] However, as the meetings continued over the two years, we realised that perhaps we had a contribution to make to the project as we have been trying to re\-shape Portsmouth to include women from Africa who \[...\] have enriched Portsmouth’s social, economic and cultural life.”* By contributing their life narratives, women from the African Women’s Forum gained a sense of belonging: *“With encouragement from the leaders of the Hidden Histories project, we began to feel part of it, enjoying the processes involved. We have grown in confidence, interacting with other women outside our comfort zone, learning their own achievements as well as verbalising our thoughts. Being recorded for the project, has made AWF members feel important and part of Portsmouth’s history.”* 

 Like other women, Marie Costa understands how the Project has enhanced the profile and standing of women in Portsmouth: *“I could not have envisaged the ultimate result and benefits of the project to members of African Women’s Forum – being involved in academic research, inclusion in the booklet written about Portsmouth’s Hidden History’ of activists women, names on plaque mounted in the centre of Portsmouth for posterity and the continuing building of positive relationship with our local University and City which we have come to call ‘Home’. We are thrilled \[...\]”* \(S5\). The significance of this engagement was marked by the unveiling of a Project\-inspired artwork celebrating participants’ autobiographies at the multicultural women’s group, ‘Chat over Chai’ on International Women’s Day, when attendees took pleasure in *“seeing their names and trying to find words they had used in their interviews”* \(S3\). 

 <ins> **Contributing to Wider Understanding of Women’s Activism**</ins> 

 This project has catalysed a shift in understanding and placed women’s pioneering action at the forefront of Portsmouth history. The project has impacted wider audiences of internationally\-recognised museums and educational charities. The Imperial War Museum’s ‘Connecting, Sharing, Learning’ project will access the interviews to engage audiences aged over 70 who have been restricted by COVID \(S8\).  The national women’s\-rights charity, FiLiA, was drawn to engage with the Portsmouth example through the project’s outcomes, and is now planning to hold its national conference in Portsmouth \(October 2021\): *“We were especially interested and excited to promote the archive. To have this accessible resource available to the public is a huge benefit to women and I’m sure will be used by women from a variety of backgrounds” \(*S10\). In October 2020 they recorded a podcast about the Project: *“Our Podcasts are \[...\] accessed by women across the globe. We typically get over 6,000 people accessing them \[...\] The connections made between women and the learning from the podcasts is \[...\] a way for Women’s voices to be heard. Our supporters tell us this \[...\] builds their knowledge and confidence in Women’s issues, history and rights”* \(S10\). 

 <ins> **Creating Enduring Memory**</ins> 

 Art remains an important form of feminist expression. Mandy Webb, activist and textile artist, was inspired to create a “Wall of Words”: *“As many of these women have protested at some time in their lives, I imagine they have made placards, they may even have painted graffiti, so I decided to put their own words in this style on the wall surrounding the plaque”* \(S3\). This was developed as a commemorative poster and reproduced in the project booklet \(S4\). In recognition of the project’s significance to the city, Portsmouth City Council is sponsoring a permanent bronze, inspired by Webb’s artwork, in the Guildhall Square as a lasting legacy.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study exemplifies how high\-quality research on transformational change has been realised and sustained long term across discrete business contexts. Research interventions in the manufacturing and service sectors have significantly increased competitiveness by improving productivity, operational efficiency, and lead\-times. The study highlights two holistic interventions tailored to their organisational contexts, including the competitive environment, processes, human resources, and training needs. Hartlepool Steel Mill represents a long\-term collaboration where the development of a Lean capability and an enhanced people management strategy prevented closure in 2017. At Benfield Motors, a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) undertaken between 2014 and 2016 focused on reducing costs and improving customer experience in aftersales. The KTP resulted in reduced customer waiting times, increased turnover, and improved operational efficiency.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Newcastle has a long track record of interdisciplinary operations management research, particularly relating to the implementation of Lean principles. Newcastle research has identified and addressed key issues associated with transformational change based on Lean principles in the manufacturing, service, and health sectors. A holistic, participative approach has been developed that tailors training and process improvement interventions to the competitive and organisational contexts of the organisation. 

 Research by Herron and Braiden \(PUB1\) developed a new diagnostic tool to tailor interventions to the organisational context. This incorporated a Productivity Needs Analysis \(PNA\), which gives an overview of key productivity measures and current manufacturing performance; a Manufacturing Needs Analysis \(MNA\), in which the plant processes and problems are defined and are associated with the appropriate tools and metrics; and a Training Needs Analysis, which identifies staff development requirements. The methodology was derived from a Quality Function Deployment \(QFD\) matrix that used a scoring system to identify priorities. This provided a framework that enabled interventions to be tailored to the local context by only selecting appropriate Lean tools. Subsequent research by Herron and Hicks \(PUB2\) reported how Lean could be transferred from an exemplar company \(Nissan\) to large and medium\-sized companies through change agents. Grant 1 extended the methodology to assist small and medium\-sized companies in the North Sea Region of Europe; it developed a framework based on Institutional Theory that explained how contextual factors shaped the approach to implementation \(PUB3\). This further justified the need for the diagnostic tool developed by Herron and Braiden \(PUB1\) to select Lean approaches according to contextual factors. 

 Subsequently, the research focus was extended to the healthcare \(Grants 2 and 3\) and motor distribution sectors \(Grant 4\). The transformational change approach considered organisations’ visions, people, and process improvement based upon Lean principles. The research in the healthcare sector identified that the NHS had adopted a transformational change model, ‘the three\-legged stool’, that comprised ‘vision’, ‘compact’ \(the psychological contract between staff and organisations\), and ‘method’, based upon the application of Lean tools and techniques \(PUB4\). This approach was later adopted by the academic team in the KTP at Benfield Motors \(Grant 4\). 

 In further research, Hicks et al. \(PUB5\) analysed the automotive supply chain. This research identified that automotive manufacturers have separate national sales companies that manage dealerships through franchise agreements. This decouples dealerships from the automotive assemblers who have expertise in Lean, leaving the continuous improvement of processes as the responsibility of the automotive franchisees. Further research identified that the politics of the workplace are an important aspect of transformational change/Lean interventions, underscoring how Lean interventions harness the exploitable desire for recognition amongst marginalised workers \(PUB6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This section demonstrates how Newcastle research has been mobilised and adopted in two significant organisations in the North East of England: one of the largest private motor dealerships in the UK and the only remaining steel mill producing bespoke steel pipes. The collaborations with both organisations have substantially increased competitiveness by improving productivity, operational efficiency, and lead\-times. 

 **Hartlepool Steel Mill** 

 The first example emphasises how a transformational change strategy based on Newcastle research, implemented from 2004, enabled Hartlepool Steel Mill to be saved from closure by its purchase by Liberty Steel in 2017. To set the context, Hartlepool Steel Mill, under various ownerships from British Steel to Corus to Tata Steel, had attempted several turnaround strategies based on Lean methodologies, but none had resulted in a sustained period of improved performance. The Managing Director \(MD\) of Hartlepool Steel Mill, then under the ownership of Corus, was an early adopter of the research detailed in PUB1 and PUB2. The MD subsequently enrolled in a part\-time PhD with Hicks and McGovern to develop a deeper understanding of transformational change. He states in a letter dated 14 January 2021: ‘ *This enabled me to implement a holistic transformational change programme that encompassed an enhanced people strategy in combination with a comprehensive, continuous improvement programme based on the PNA/MNA/TNA analysis’* \[IMP1\]. He goes on to say that this combined approach enabled Hartlepool Steel Mill to develop a continuous improvement capability under his leadership. 

 In 2015–16, there was a steep decline in the market for specialised steel pipe caused by a collapse in the oil price from USD120/barrel to USD28/barrel. This precipitated announcements of reductions in UK production capacity from major steel producers. Tata Steel had decided to divest, or if necessary, close the Hartlepool Steel Mill. However, in 2017 Liberty House acquired the Hartlepool Steel Mill. The MD states: ‘ *Liberty House acquired the Hartlepool Steel Mill because they perceived it as a world class asset that could be restored to its former glory. Liberty were inspired by the significant improvement in productivity due to the successful transformational change capability which was embedded in the Company’* \[IMP1\]. The MD notes that this protected the employment of 200 people in Hartlepool, which is the fourth most employment\-deprived local authority in England, according to the  [English Indices of Deprivation 2019](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/835115/IoD2019_Statistical_Release.pdf). The MD comments that ‘ *The improvement capability established and sustained through the transformational change programme made the Company sufficiently resilient to survive and compete in a declining and highly competitive market’* \[IMP1\]. 

 The MD completes his testimonial by stating that ‘ *The Hartlepool Steel Mill is continuing its journey of enhancing its capability in process improvement and transformational change’*, noting that since 2014 productivity has improved by a further 8% \[IMP1\]. 

 Therefore, during the current REF period the Company was saved from closure, thereby protecting employment, and productivity was improved by a further 8%. This demonstrates that the transformational change strategy informed by the collaboration with Newcastle researchers has had the sustained impact that previous strategies failed to achieve. 

 **Benfield Motor Group** 

 The second example details the significant impact of a transformational change intervention in an automotive dealership. In 2014, Benfield Motor Group had 1,500 staff and was one of the largest and best\-known private companies in the motor retailing market, with a chain of 34 franchised dealerships. Strong aftersales performance is a crucial outcome of a successful business model in motor distribution. It provides a stable source of profit and insulates against seasonal and other fluctuations in the car sales market. In line with the sector, the contribution that Benfield enjoyed from this area was falling relative to overall costs. To address this and to increase customer satisfaction, the Company had taken a strategic decision to introduce a programme of transformational change but did not have the expertise in\-house. Previous attempts to introduce change with the support of consultants had failed. As noted in Section 2, the automotive manufacturers’ national sales organisations decouple distributors from automotive manufacturing expertise in Lean \(PUB5\). Therefore, Benfield’s CEO commissioned the Newcastle team to assist with transformational change. An ESRC/Innovate UK\-funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Benfield \(Grant 4\), launched in January 2014, increased productivity and improved customer service as part of Benfield’s ‘Work Smart’ programme \(detailed in PUB6\). 

 The KTP adopted ‘the three\-legged\-stool’ approach to transformational change \(PUB4\), encompassing, vision, people \(role specifications, job design, reward structures, and training\), and process improvement. The KTP Associate led teams of technicians to design and implement process improvements in the Aftersales Department. Employees were trained in using problem\-solving tools, understanding value streams, and the importance of managing workflow to meet customer requirements. This was based on previous research conducted by Herron and Hicks \(PUB2\), the ERIP project \(Grant 1 and PUB3\), and transformational change in the NHS \(Grants 2 and 3 and PUB 4\). The aftersales work was segmented into a ‘green stream’ for fully predictable work \(such as services for relatively new cars\), an ‘amber stream’ for semi\-predictable work \(such as servicing slightly older cars\), and a ‘red stream’ for unpredictable, reactive work. Improved efficiency enabled the Company to service more cars with their existing resources. 

 The KTP was rated as outstanding \(the highest possible rating\) by Innovate UK \[IMP2\] and is featured as a case study on the ESRC’s website \[IMP3\]. The ‘Company Partner’ element of the Final Report \[IMP4\], which has been independently assessed by Innovate UK, and the case study published on the ESRC website \[IMP3\] both attribute the following impacts directly to the KTP: 

-  Increase in the Company's annual sales turnover of GBP720,000; 

-  Customer waiting time at the dealership for routine services reduced from 2 hours to less than 45 minutes; 

-  Process improvements reduced booking lead\-time from 1–5 days to 1 day; 

-  Where a courtesy car was requested, lead\-time was reduced from 1–15 days to 0–9 days. 

 Benfield’s Strategic Development Director explains in the Final Report \[IMP4\] that the KTP had been initiated due to the former CEO’s view that Lean was the future of aftersales. He comments: ‘ *Over the two\-year project, we have developed a clear vision for the transformation of aftersales, and have developed a plan and training package to achieve this’* \[IMP4\] *.* In assessing the impact on the Company, he makes the following comments regarding staff: ‘ *The method of implementation has allowed many individuals across the organisation to have benefited from acquiring knowledge of process improvement tools and techniques that has informed the KTP’; ‘Staff have been upskilled and have been able to contribute to making improvements. Communication channels between different departments have been substantially improved’*; and ‘ *Staff have been motivated to identify and continually make improvements to their work areas and help colleagues make improvements in other areas of the business. These improvements have resulted in increased productivity and efficiency throughout the aftersales function’* \[IMP4\]. In terms of customers, he comments, *‘Customers have appreciated the fast service offered by the green lane innovation that the KTP has produced’*, and ‘ *Customers have received a quicker, more efficient service’* \[IMP4\]. 

 In his concluding remarks to the Final Report, the Strategic Development Director comments, ‘ *Due to the complexities of implementing transformational change, the KTP was vital in developing the strong foundations for what we see as a long journey. The academic team was able to provide guidance to the project owing to their prior experience of, and engagement with, this type of change initiative’* \[IMP4\]. 

 The significant impacts on both Hartlepool Steel Mill and Benfield Motors are examples of impact arising from Newcastle’s long track record of interdisciplinary operations management research combined with extensive collaborations with organisations.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 **Engagement with autism stakeholders** has led to a range of impacts, including forms of co\-creation. Parents have been influenced through presentations, social media and publications, leading to **greater understanding** of issues which affect them and their children, and providing **practical advice** for engendering more positive outcomes. Teachers have been supported, adding to their awareness of issues relating to **the inclusion of autistic children** in educational contexts, and including tools to aid teachers in their classroom roles. Institutional policy has been influenced to create an autism\-friendly campus. Wider impact has been secured through the media, local networks, and an arts\-based project.

 **2. Underpinning research** – References in section 3 are indicated by number \(e.g., **R1**\) 

 Lawrence’s interest in Shared Education \(or ‘Flexischooling’\) is discussed in her monograph *Autism and flexischooling: a shared classroom and homeschooling approach* \(Jessica Kingsley, 2012\), and further explored as the subject of her PhD \(2017\). Building on the work of Roland Meighan and pioneering educator John Holt, her research considers the impact of involving parents of autistic children as active co\-educators, working with schools as partners.  Co\-creation runs through Lawrence’s research activity and sharing the autistic child’s education has been shown to have potential to personalise that education, empower parents, support schools, and ameliorate for some the perceived shortcomings in the education system for autistic pupils. Lawrence’s work has been shared through considerable social media presence, conference presentation and publication \( **R1**\). 

 Lawrence’s research with parents has developed since 2016 to include research on autism education as positioned regarding teachers.  A key finding of her empirical study into trainee teachers’ perceptions was that descriptions of autism focused more on communication and less on social aspects, when articulated by those who identified as having personal experience of autism. Perceptions among this group were also found to be more positive, varied and specific, as well as less generalised **\(R2\).** In response, Lawrence has embedded the voice of autistic individuals in both her on\-going research and in her teaching, and has embraced personal recount of experiences of autism as valid methodology.  Her edited research\-based collection, *Teacher Education and Autism: A Research\-Based Practical Handbook* \(Jessica Kingsley, 2019\), showcases individual educators’ experiences of autism in Initial Teacher Education \(ITE\), and is a ‘valuable handbook \[that provides\] guidance in how a child who has autism is different to their peers and how a teacher can understand and accommodate these differences to ensure that school provides the opportunity to learn both the academic and social curriculum’; a ‘fascinating insight into autism for trainee teachers and practising teachers wishing to increase their understanding of autism’; and identified as ‘engaging, extremely informative and highly accessible’. In line with best practice, as suggested by the draft framework for inclusive social science autism research \(Chown *et al.*, 2017\), Lawrence includes practitioner researchers as intrinsic to her work. 

 Lawrence’s work further contributes to an otherwise under\-explored element of research through focus on the understanding of education by the autistic teacher.  In 2017, Lawrence received an internal research grant \(BGU Student Engagement Innovation Fund\) to explore the perceptions of education with an autistic trainee teacher \( **R3**\).  Inclusion of the autistic voice in her research continues with a study exploring reading of literature from an autistic perspective, co\-researched with an autistic English teacher \( **R4**\) **,** together with portrayal of autistic characters in classroom texts as understood by both autistic and non\-autistic readers \( **R5**\). An exploration of the presentation of autistic dysfluency in the classroom, co\-researched with artist Dr John Rimmer, and an autistic researcher, further considered the efficacy of teacher education in autism \( **R6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** – Sources in section 5 are indicated by number \(e.g., **S1**\) 

 Impact is refected in a widening range of activities, particularly locally and regionally, and an emerging national and international reach. 

 The central aim has been: 

-  Contributing to the attitudinal shift that moves perceptions of autism from being a purely medical condition \(the ‘Medical model’\) to being understandood as a societal issue \(‘Social model’\). 

 Impact types have included: 

-  Stimulating engagement in research; 

-  Developing professional/practitioner practice and networks; 

-  Enhancing understanding; 

-  Shaping awareness; 

-  Media contributions; 

-  Teaching. 

 Partnership and co\-creation have been essential, with principal beneficiaries including: 

-  Parents; 

-  School teachers; 

-  Professional networks; 

-  Event audiences and media readerships; 

-  Home HEI institution; 

-  Students; 

-  Autistic individuals \(who may be in any of the above\). 

 **Influencing parents** 

 Impact has been upon parents who may be in considerable distress regarding their autistic child’s education, and would like to be more confident in their full involvement in that education. This is reflected in feedback and comments from different correspondents, participants and readers \( **S1**\), one testimonial adding that Lawrence’s “significant, credible academic rationale” regarding shared education has “impacted and supported thousands of families with ASD youngsters, giving them not only tangible explanations, but practical advice and hope” \( **S2**\). 

 Engagement activities directed towards parents and other potential beneficiaries have utlised various social media outlets, for example, *Flexischooling Families UK, Flexischooling Practitioners, Centre for Personalised Education, Light on Education Research Network*, and *Home Education and Flexischooling Research group*\). There have also been public events and learning exchanges; and evidence of the *Flexichooling Handbook* \(2018\) estimated to be ‘beyond 40,000 people’ \( **S2**\). 

 **Influencing teachers** 

 Lawrence supports trainee teachers to develop their understanding of autism, having direct reach to over 300 students each year and witnessing a ‘ripple effect’ as these teachers enter the profession. Her work gives ‘greater awareness of autism’ and provided ‘tools to effectively differentiate \[and to support\] understanding’ \(personal correspondence\). Similarly, lecturers within the university recognise help given through the Staff Development programme and individual support, commenting, for example, ‘there was no better person to talk to than Dr Clare Lawrence. I now know how to hone and improve my teaching skill to suit and accommodate all learners’ and ‘I just wish to thank you for … my growing understanding of autism and related issues’ and that she has ‘certainly raised awareness of autism’ \( **S3**\). 

  

 **Engaging the home institution** 

 In 2017, Lawrence instigated the *Autism Friendly Campus* project through BGU’s Centre for Enhancement in Learning and Teaching \(CELT\), which sought feedback from autistic students at the University.  This resulted in significant changes to university policy and practice through the *Bishop Grosseteste Autism Friendly Campus Action Plan* \( **S4**\).  The University has, since the 2019\-20 application cycle, offered smaller campus tour groups including the option to have a campus tour on an alternative day to open days, programmed additional daytime social events during Freshers’ Week and beyond, written guidance regarding the informal rules that govern movement around campus, and made explicit the provision for students to remove themselves from situations in lectures or seminars that they find stressful. 

 Through joint funding by CELT and the SU, several ‘Quiet Spaces’ on campus containing sensory equipment have been created, accessible to all members of the university community who require them. 

 **Engaging with local networks** 

 Impact has been achieved in roles as East Midlands Convenor for the Participatory Autism Research Collective \(PARC\) and Lincolnshire County Council Autism Champion. These promote interventions is health, social care services, business, as well as education settings. 

 Other impact utilising different media included contributing to the film *Broken,* exhibited as part of the ‘Trunk Call’ Residency, General Practitioner Studios, Lincoln, 9\-30 November 2020, with public on\-line event \(due to Covid restrictions\). 

#  **Engaging with the media and wider sector** 

 A number of public impact outputs have been commissioned by sector networks and media, for example, articles for: 

-  National Autistic Society, online forum *Network Autism* \(typically, 5.5 million visitors per year\), on *Autism and Flexischooling* \(2018\); 

-  *SEN magazine* \(typical readership 36,000 per issue\); 

-  *The Big Issue* \(typical readership 400,000 per issue\). \( **S5**\) 

 In addition, book publications aimed at general readerships have a widening international influence \(publication in the UK, US, and Australia; translation into Dutch, Hebrew, Italian and Spanish\). *Teacher Education and Autism: A Research\-Based Practical Handbook* \(see section 2 above\) was ranked in the top 1% of all books sold by Amazon in its publication month, and was in the 100 Bestseller Rankings in three categories. As well as 102 views in the UK, a BERA blog has had international reach been read in India \(15\), and the US, China, Malaysia, Singapore and South Africa \(15\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dominic Wilkinson’s research on the ethical basis for life and death decisions in the care of seriously ill children and infants has been incorporated into professional guidance in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Philippines. It has influenced over 13 court judgements in the UK alone where it has been quoted in the delineation of when withholding or withdrawal of treatment is in an infant’s best interests, when treatment is considered futile. In these cases, content from the guidelines directly informed the judgements given. In over 30 media appearances, he has also changed public and professional understanding of the underlying ethical issues at stake in this controversial area. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the last decade, the Critical Decisions research, led by Wilkinson, has provided systematic ethical analysis of life and death decisions for children and newborn infants. The aim of this work has been to use the tools of analytic medical ethics to clarify the basis of decisions, constructively revise and improve existing guidance for professionals, and to improve health professionals’ and the public’s understanding of these fraught and difficult decisions. The body of work resulted in a novel ‘dissensus’ framework which has been widely cited by peers and used to influence vital medical decisions. 

  

 The first part of this research, was conducted between July and December 2010, in a postdoc following his PhD. During his postdoc time, Wilkinson built on his PhD research by elaborating and extending his account of the ethical boundaries for parental decision\-making. He submitted for publication his “threshold framework” relating to brain damage and disability and its role on decisions for newborns \(submitted July 2010, published 2011\) \[1\], and wrote a book proposal and the first draft of his monograph \(published by Oxford University Press in 2013\) \[2\]. That work set out a conceptual analysis of decisions based on the child’s quality of life – clarifying and distinguishing various ways in which disability might be relevant to a child’s best interests. He examined the role of parents in decisions and proposed a ‘Threshold framework’ as a way of conceptualising the limits of parental discretion in decisions \[1,2\]. 

  

 Subsequently \(from 2013\-20\) Wilkinson extended his earlier research to develop a parallel ‘Threshold’ framework for decisions relating to the initial care of extremely premature infants \(EPI\) \[3\]. He argued that such decisions should move away from a focus on the specific degree of prematurity and focus instead on infants’ prognosis \[3,4\]. 

  

 Recent work \(2017\-19\) following a series of high\-profile and controversial cases, has examined issues relating to disagreement over the treatment of children or infants. That culminated in a book, co\-authored with Oxford colleague Julian Savulescu, which analyses the scope and place of reasonable disagreement in such decisions \[5\]. He proposed a novel ‘dissensus’ framework for helping to resolve disagreements, and published in leading medical journals on the ethical approach to resolving disagreement with parents \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Each year in the United Kingdom, approximately 40,000 seriously ill infants and children are admitted to intensive care units. Despite advances in medical science and treatment, a proportion of these children do not recover from their illness. The majority of deaths follow decisions to withdraw or withhold potentially life\-prolonging treatment. In clarifying ethical questions surrounding these decisions, and in the development of novel ethical frameworks for clinical decision\-making, Wilkinson’s research has significantly impacted public understanding and debate, legal rulings, and professional guidance, each discussed below. 

###  Development of a clear ethical framework used in courts for quality of life decisions for children 

 Wilkinson’s research has examined pre\-existing guidance for UK health professionals around decisions for children. There is no statutory law relating to withdrawal of life\-sustaining treatment, but professional guidelines had been cited by judges in cases, and consequently incorporated into case law. Wilkinson was part of a working group that revised the ambiguous criteria that were being used, and published new guidelines in 2015 \[A\]. The guidelines the group developed have subsequently informed decisions on at least 13 cases related to such medical decisions in the UK, specifically quoting the revised criteria in the new guidance \[B\]. For example, in introducing an expert witness report on the case of Re M \(Declaration of Death of a Child\) \[2020\], Sir Andrew McFarlane noted directly that Professor Wilkinson’s “high level of professional expertise” in his involvement in developing the 2015 guideline was of “direct relevance to the issue in these proceedings” \[B, page 6\]. In another example \(the court case of Alder Hey v Evans, 2018\), Justice Hayden noted “It is necessary here to root my own conclusions in the framework of the Law and within the available guidance. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has produced guidance, ...” He then quoted verbatim from the revised guidance \[B\], \[C, page 17\]. 

###  Influence on decisions relating to extremely premature newborn infants: development/revision of national and international guidelines 

 Wilkinson’s research into the basis for decisions regarding extremely premature newborn infants has international reach, having influenced professional guidance outside the UK, in Australia and the Philippines. Wilkinson was the lead author on the first South Australian guidance relating to resuscitation decisions for extremely premature newborn infants \[D\]. This was the first published professional guidance to specifically incorporate prognosis into decisions, drawing on Wilkinson’s novel framework \(the PAGE framework – Prognosis Average Gestation Equivalent\) \[3, above\]. He was consulted by a working group developing similar guidance in Queensland, and the PAGE framework was also included in that guideline \[E\]. 

 In the Philippines, Wilkinson has collaborated with neonatologists and ethicists to address the extremely challenging treatment decisions they faced in a limited\-resource setting. There was no existing ethical guidance for such decisions, and in January 2018 he conducted a national survey of specialist neonatologists in the Philippines to assess existing practice, attitudes and understanding \[4, above\]. In February 2019, he convened a consensus workshop at the Philippine Society of Newborn Medicine national conference \[F\]. The Vice President of the Philippine Society has noted that Wilkinson was “very effective” in coordinating a large group of professionals to develop consensus and that he completed the first draft the resulting guidelines, which are highly rated by local paediatricians and “very relevant in our practice” \[G\]. Another participant in the workshop who facilitated Wilkinson’s work in the Philippines wrote, “Prof Dominic \[Wilkinson\] has been a catalyst of ethical change in the Philippines context of neonatal care.” \[H\] 

 In 2018\-9, Wilkinson was part of a working group that developed a new national framework for resuscitation of extremely preterm infants for the UK. That framework was published in October 2019 \[I\]. The ethical principles underpinning that framework were based on Wilkinson’s published research, and he wrote key sections of the framework, particularly relating decision\-making to prognosis. The president of the British Association of Perinatal Medicine has acknowledged Wilkinson’s “enormous contribution” to the framework, his “very active role” in developing the guidance \[J\]. The new guidance endorsed the possibility of providing active stabilisation to a group of extremely preterm infants at 22 weeks gestation – where previous guidance had recommended against active treatment. An editorial in The Lancet noted that “the report provides a practical and thoughtful approach in this very complex area of perinatal medicine” \[K\]. 

###  Improvement of public understanding and contribution to public debate in relation to parent\-doctor disagreement concerning medical treatment 

 Wilkinson’s research into ethics around conflicts between doctors and parents led to wide national and international public attention at the time of high\-profile cases \(Charlie Gard March\-July 2017, Alfie Evans Jan\-April 2018, Tafida Raqeeb September\-October 2019\). Wilkinson’s work with the media around these cases was cited positively by the UK Science Media Centre \(who clarify poorly understood science headline stories\): 

 *“Without Dominic and a frustratingly small number of other medics, the media would have had no access to impartial, evidence\-based expertise whatsoever, and the public would have been woefully misinformed about childhood disease and prognosis.”* \[L\] 

 These cases attracted a great deal of media attention \[M\], and Wilkinson gave interviews nationally and internationally, including on the BBC, CNN, Sky Television, The Times, \[M\]. Social media comments also highlight his role in helping to inform wider understanding about the role of parents and of the courts, with Twitter users who had watched his interview with Good Morning Britain, which had an average daily audience of 640,000 in 2018 \[N, page 3\]. Comments on social media included a referral to Wilkinson’s “incredibly important point\[s\]” \[M, page 5\], commending him as “the voice of reason” \[M, page 2\], and expressed gratitude to Wilkinson for “publicly giving a much needed, very balanced and empathic presentation” \[M, page 6\].  He has subsequently been consulted and been involved in working with families and professionals to develop practical ways to improve resolution of such disagreements.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Managing risks posed by climate change is challenging because of deep uncertainty about the future plus a lack of sector\-level guidance on *how* to adapt. Wilby’s research into climate risk management and adaptation frameworks enabled EDF Energy and Multi\-lateral Development Banks to adapt their investments in energy and water infrastructure by strengthening engineering design and technical practices. Impacts were: \(1\) increased safety margins for testing coastal flood defences at Sizewell C against sea level rise; \(2\) climate resilient upgrading and operation of hydropower infrastructure in Tajikistan; and \(3\) management of climate risks within infrastructure investments made by the Asian Development Bank. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Businesses and Multi\-lateral Development Banks \(MDBs\) are setting ambitious targets for adapting to climate change. This is because long\-lived energy and water infrastructure \(such as hydropower plants\) must deliver intended social, economic, and environmental benefits for many decades to come, despite deep uncertainty about climate change. Meanwhile, aging assets must be refurbished to improve safety and performance under conditions that were not envisaged at the time of their design. 

 These are technically demanding tasks and there are limited tools or sector guidance to support practitioners – especially in low\-capacity, data\-sparse regions of Africa, Asia, and South America. Yet, such places are facing some of the most extreme impacts of climate change and are where most new infrastructure is yet to be built. During the period 2008\-2016, Wilby addressed these knowledge gaps at Loughborough University through research into climate risk management \(CRM\) frameworks and development of tools for regional climate change simulation. 

 Conventional approaches to CRM begin with model projections of expected climate change and impacts. Thinking about how to adapt comes much later, by when decision\-makers are confronted with deep uncertainty. Consequently, generic solutions – such as strengthened hazard monitoring and forecasting systems – are typically offered. 

 In contrast, the CRM framework devised by Wilby starts with the project goal\(s\) and asks, “what adaptation measures are needed to achieve these outcomes despite a wide range of plausible climate conditions?” \( **R1**\). A key advantage of this framework, developed with researchers at Leeds University and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, is that future climate scenarios and adaptation options are co\-designed with practitioners. This leads to a deeper and shared understanding of system vulnerabilities. The CRM framework is also less resource\-demanding in terms of the amount of analysis required yet provides information about adaptation and development outcomes that remains valid regardless of ongoing climate model refinement – so is effectively ‘scenario\-neutral’ \( **R2, R3**\). 

 Wilby undertook research to test the CRM framework in practice. Early research partners were EDF Energy in the UK \( **R4**\) and Denver Water in Colorado \( **R5**\). The EDF Energy Climate Change Working Group \(Chaired by Wilby\) evaluated ways of adapting the new nuclear build site at Sizewell, UK to high\-end sea level changes and more extreme weather. Despite deep uncertainty about credible maximum sea\-level projections \(and flood risk\), flexibility and allowances for climate change were factored into the plan. When combined with routine monitoring, the site can now be adaptively managed into the 2200s. With Denver Water, the CRM framework was used to test the extent to which a legal instrument to reallocate water rights could offset expected drought and catchment changes over coming decades. The new drought measures were estimated to improve water supplies by 35 billion litres \(enough to meet the needs of 300,000 residents of Denver\). 

 Meanwhile, Wilby continued to enhance the functionality of his climate scenario tool – the Statistical DownScaling Model \(SDSM\). This was used alongside the CRM framework to simulate long daily weather series for stress\-testing the performance of adaptation measures under plausible climate change conditions. Since an upgrade in 2014, SDSM has been capable of infilling missing weather information in broken meteorological records and providing extreme value statistics for rare hydro\-climatic events \( **R6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Pathways to the impacts** 

 Wilby’s Climate Risk Management \(CRM\) framework and climate scenario tool \(SDSM\) equipped businesses and MDBs with improved procedures and technical standards for strengthening the climate resilience of their long\-lived infrastructure investments. This was achieved through pathways of technical assistance and secondments, *in situ* training programmes, and co\-development of practical guidance with project teams. 

 Successful adaptation to future climate threats is more likely to arise when risks and options are factored into infrastructure designs and operating rules. According to the founder of the Alliance for Global Water Adaptation \(AGWA\), Wilby’s CRM “ *helped to transform the way that partner organizations manage water basins in light of climate change scenarios … This thinking was subsequently enshrined within the 2015 World Bank ‘Decision Tree Framework’, which makes explicit reference to the work of Wilby as foundational to the framework. At least 25 billion US dollars are invested annually in water infrastructure by the World Bank following the Decision Tree Framework…*” \( **S1**\). 

 Thanks to the high visibility of his work with the World Bank, Wilby was invited to give technical advice on climate risk and vulnerability assessment to other non\-academic organizations. Examples include: shaping the methodologies applied by the second UK Climate Change Risk Assessment under the auspices of the Committee on Climate Change; advising the World Bank and International Fund for Agricultural Development on climate adaptation in Yemen; evaluating strategic research opportunities and proposals for the Department for International Development ClimDev\-Africa, CIASA and WISER programmes; and developing guidance on the evaluation of physical climate hazards for the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative \(UNEP\-FI\) working group \( **S2**\). 

 The tool and scenarios produced by SDSM, were cited in National Communications submitted by Non\-Annex I parties, such as Niger \(2016\), Iran \(2018\), and Yemen \(2018\) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; a key graphic from output R1 appears in the National Communication of Bangladesh \(2018\). 

 **Evidence is given below of specific impacts** on climate adaptation design standards, technical capacities, and procedures adopted by three organizations: \(1\) EDF Energy at Sizewell; \(2\) the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \(EBRD\) in Tajikistan; and \(3\) the Asian Development Bank \(ADB\) for investments across Asia. 

 **Impact 1: Increased safety margins for testing coastal flood defences at Sizewell C against sea level rise** 

 Credible maximum sea level rise scenarios for the UK east coast developed by Wilby were cited in the planning application submitted by EDF Energy to the Planning Inspectorate in May 2020 under the Planning Act 2008 \( **S3**\). Extreme sea level scenarios are required to test the design of the main Sizewell C sea defences as part of the Main Development Site Flood Risk Assessment. The planning application \(section 5.3.2\) states that 

 “*It is proposed to use the UKCP18 RCP8.5 at 95%ile* \[Met Office 2018 UK Climate Projections UKCP18\] *allowances for the normal breach and coastal inundation scenarios for all considered epochs. For the scenario with breach of main Sizewell C sea defences, that are designed for 1 in 10,000\-year event, it is proposed to use more conservative allowances derived from previous studies, namely the BECC* \[Wilby\] *Upper allowance.*” 

 As a result, more stringent climate change allowances for sea level rise are embedded in the planning application \(Table 5.3\) for key points in time of the Sizewell C development. By year 2140 \(the phase by which the interim spent fuel store is decommissioned\), simulations of main sea defences must withstand more conservative upper\-bound sea level change scenario of 3.920 metres \(Wilby\) compared with 1.815 metres \(UKCP18\). By year 2190 \(the theoretical maximum site lifetime\), the sea level rise scenarios are 4.820 metres \(Wilby\) compared with 2.645 metres \(UKCP18\). 

 **Impact 2: Climate resilient upgrading and operation of hydropower infrastructure in Tajikistan** 

 Hydropower provides 98% of the electricity supply in Tajikistan but the sector is highly vulnerable to climate change because of potential reductions in snow and ice stores, plus changing risks to infrastructure from avalanches, floods and mudslides. Wilby increased the adaptive capacity of the hydropower sector by providing technical assistance to EBRD through Phase 1 of the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience \(PPCR\) in Tajikistan \( **S4**\). His technical evaluation of reservoir inflow scenarios for the rehabilitation of the Qairokkum hydropower plant underpinned three adaptation strategies \( **S4**\). These were replacement of old turbines with more efficient equipment, replacement and installation of additional generating capacity, or partial replacement with phased retirement of turbines. Subsequently, EBRD and PPCR exercised the third option and invested $75 million, with wider provisions for national capacity building in climate monitoring, climate risk assessment, and seasonal forecasting \(see Phase 2 below\). Wilby also delivered seven training modules for hydropower engineers and planners in Tajikistan during the period 2016\-2020. 

 Practical insights gained from the Qairokkum rehabilitation project \(above\) were later incorporated within the International Hydropower Association \(IHA\) *Hydropower Sector Climate Resilience Guide* \( **S5**\). Wilby presented key recommendations on ways of applying the guidance in data sparse/low capacity regions during an international hydropower workshop held at the EBRD headquarters in London, January 2019. The IHA guide provides a point of reference on climate resilience for hydropower engineers in over 100 member organizations across more than 80 countries. 

 Phase 2 of the programme included activities for strengthening technical capacities in climate resilience amongst professionals within the hydropower sector of Tajikistan and beyond. Wilby co\-designed and delivered a new professional development programme on climate risk management techniques with counterparts in the energy sector of Tajikistan. Participants came from Tajik Hydromet \(state agency\), Barqui Tokik \(the national electricity supplier\), and the Tajik Technical University. His “recipe” for long\-range forecasting of river flows was followed by Tajik Hydromet in winters 2019 and 2020 to anticipate inflows to the largest hydropower plant in Tajikistan \( **S6**\). Wilby’s technique enabled reservoir managers to predict whether there would be more, less, or average inflow for energy production three months before the standard forecast issued at the start of the spring snowmelt season. 

 **Impact 3: Management of climate risks within infrastructure investments of the Asian Development Bank** 

 From 2017, Wilby assisted ADB’s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department to reform processes and practices for managing climate risks to their adaptation investments. By then, his CRM framework was already visible within operational advice such as the ADB *Guidelines for Climate Proofing Investment in the Water Sector* \( **S7**\). However, his 2017 review of ADB procedures laid out a programme of work for rationalizing practices and building capacity/guidance in climate risk management. This materialized in a new set of operating principles for climate\-proofing infrastructure projects, co\-developed with other ADB consultants \( **S7**\). The new processes were subsequently rolled\-out via training workshops delivered by Wilby at ADB headquarters in Manila, Philippines in 2018 and 2019. 

 Wilby’s contribution to the training included worked examples of the CRM for ADB specialists, sector teams and departments across Asia and the Pacific region. This was supported by a raft of other resources to embed allowances for climate change in project designs \( **S8**\). His “go to” compendium of climate information sources helps ADB Project Preparatory Technical Assistance teams to source essential data for climate risk assessments. His 2020 Knowledge Product, and 2020 *Manual on Climate Change Adjustments* \( **S8**\) show engineers how to incorporate allowances for climate change in detailed designs of roads, culverts, and coastal infrastructure. 

 During 2019\-2020, Wilby also provided technical reviews of 28 *Climate Risk Country Profiles* on behalf of ADB and the World Bank \( **S9**\). Each profile synthesizes information about climate change, disaster risk reduction, and adaptation actions and policies at the country level. ADB and the World Bank state that these profiles 

 “*are designed as a quick reference source for development practitioners to better integrate climate resilience in development planning and policy making …to facilitate upstream country diagnostics, policy dialogue, and strategic planning by providing comprehensive overviews of trends and projected changes in key climate parameters, sector\-specific implications, relevant policies and programs, adaptation priorities and opportunities for further actions*” \( **S9**\). 

 According to a former ADB Senior Climate Change Adaptation Specialist, Wilby “ *has been making substantial contributions to improving ADB’s operational procedures and practice for managing climate risks to investment projects*” \( **S10**\). The legacy of his research has been upgrades to substantial infrastructure investments as well as to operating procedures for energy and water systems so that intended development outcomes are delivered despite climate change.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Osteopathy has historically been underpinned by a limited evidence base, but UCO research studies have had a cumulative impact on improving professional knowledge and changing the culture of practice. Empirical knowledge has been generated \- about treatment risks and adverse events to improve safety in clinical practice; to improve osteopaths’ awareness of, and attitudes to, using evidence\-informed practice; and to develop guidelines to support best practice for common musculoskeletal conditions. A portfolio of outputs influenced changes in the General Osteopathic Council’s \(GOsC\) standards of practice and continuing professional development \(CPD\) regulations for the specified activities required for annual registration. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 To explore safety issues in osteopathic practice, **SV** led the Clinical Risk in Osteopathy and Management study \(CROaM\) \( **1.** **Vogel et al, 2013**\), funded by the GOsC to gather data on adverse effects. The survey included 1,082 UK osteopaths \(27.8%\) and 2,057 patients \(77% at 6 week follow\-up\), plus interviews with 19 patients and 24 practitioners. Temporary side\-effects were reported by 4% of patients, but not directly linked to manipulation. Concerning deficits in osteopaths’ communication and consent processes were identified. The report concluded that serious problems were rare, but osteopaths should be vigilant about risk. Enhanced guidance about consent and adverse event reporting were recommended. Following this, **OT** co\-authored a GOsC\-funded report to identify how regulatory activities could support practice and align with professional standards \( **2.** **McGivern et al 2015**\). Literature reviews explored scope of practice, health professional regulation and fitness to practise, with an online survey of 809 osteopaths \(17%\) and 55 interviews. Limited evidence about treatment risks and benefits were reported as sources of professional insecurity and ambivalence about evidence\-based practice \(EBP\). Diverse approaches made standard\-based regulation complex, especially with independent practitioners. The report recommended introducing peer discussions into osteopathic regulation processes. 

 Subsequently, **OT** collaborated in a survey of osteopaths’ attitudes to EBP; the Evidence\-Based Practice Attitude and Utilisation Survey \(EBASE\) \( **3.** **Sundberg et al 2017**\). Generally positive attitudes and moderate\-level skills, but infrequent use of EBP were reported by 375 osteopaths. Perceived barriers included lack of time and limited osteopathic evidence, indicating the need to improve osteopaths’ use of EBP in clinical practice. To promote to EBP, **SV** participated in a guideline development group; NICE guidelines for low back pain and sciatica in over 16s \( **4.** **NICE 2016**\). New recommendations that manual therapy should only be offered in packages incorporating exercises or psychological interventions highlighted an urgent need to change  monomodal, biomechanical treatment models, prompting research into biopsychosocial approaches \(Case Study 2\). **SV** also collaborated in developing the IFOMPT Cervical Framework Document \( **5.** **Rushton et al 2020**\), providing guidance for physical therapists to minimise risks in the clinical management of patients with head and neck pain. Arterial pathologies in the neck may masquerade as musculoskeletal dysfunction and lead to serious consequences if not identified. New guidance about  avoiding provocative positional testing were based on its’ low predictive ability and potential adverse test effects. Recommended changes in history taking, examination and decision\-making were used to strengthen osteopathic training and CPD. 

 Paediatric osteopathy is also limited by lack of evidence on treatment effects. **DC** led a systematic review into manual therapy effects for unsettled, distressed and excessively crying infants \( **6.** **Carnes et al 2017**\). Nineteen studies \(seven RCTs\) found moderate strength evidence for favourable effects on crying time but inconclusive results for sleep and parent\-child relations. Risks were low at seven non\-serious events per 1000 infants. It was unclear whether the small effect sizes were meaningful, but manual therapy was relatively safe. Findings led to development of a randomised controlled trial in paediatric osteopathy.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research into the risks of adverse events, especially in cervical spine assessment and manipulation, and into communication and informed consent led to substantive changes in the General Osteopathic Council’s \(GOsC\) regulatory policies. The cumulative impact of  [<ins>UCO research on adverse events</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/research-surveys/gosc-research/adverse-events/) is documented in committee reports about changes to the Osteopathic Practice Standards \(OPS\), Guidelines for Osteopathic Pre\-Registration Osteopathic Education \(GOPRE\) and Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) scheme. 

 The Clinical Risk in Osteopathy and Management study \(CROaM\) identified deficits in communication about consent \( [<ins>Vogel et al 2013</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/research-and-surveys/the-croam-study-february-2013/croam-full-report-0313.pdf)\). A report on professional regulation and compliance with standards identified challenges in monitoring osteopaths with diverse clinical practices \( [<ins>McGivern et al 2015</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/research-surveys/gosc-research/research-to-promote-effective-regulation/)\).  [<ins>Rushton et</ins> <ins>al’s</ins>](https://www.ifompt.org/site/ifompt/IFOMPT%20Cervical%20Framework%20final%20September%202020.pdf) \(2020\) IFOMPT report outlined risks relating to cervical spine treatment. This data has been incorporated into changes in GOsC expectations about standards of practice for qualified osteopaths \( **Source 1,**  [<ins> **GOsC</ins> <ins>2018**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pac-june-2018-osteopathic-practice-standards-implementation/)\) and levels of competence in undergraduate student education \( **Source 2,**  [<ins> **GOsC</ins> <ins>2020**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pec-october-2020-item-3-review-of-guidance-for-pre-registration/)\). Regulatory changes also include requirements for osteopaths to engage in case\-based peer discussions as part of three\-year CPD cycles, recommended by McGivern et al \(2015\) to promote engagement with standards in confidential, formative activities to highlight weaknesses and reduce misconduct, whilst acknowledging diverse attitudes and approaches. Osteopaths must now also participate in formal ‘Communication and Consent’ CPD activities \( **Source 3,**  [<ins> **GOsC**</ins>](https://cpd.osteopathy.org.uk/themes/communication-and-consent/) <ins> **2021**</ins>\). 

 The study of clinical risks \(Vogel et al 2013\) led to a collaborative review of assessment methods for serious cervical spine dysfunctions \( **Source 4**  [<ins> **Vaughan et al 2016**</ins>](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2016.01.007)\). Findings have been used to enhance osteopaths’ communication, consent and clinical reasoning skills in popular, ongoing <ins>CPD</ins>  [<ins>courses</ins>. <ins>Communication and consent</ins>](https://cpd.uco.ac.uk/communication-and-consent-14-may-2021) ran 10 times between 2014 and 2020 with 274 osteopaths \( **Source 5a**\). Findings from CROaM also generated CPD courses about the risks specific to  [<ins>cervical spine assessment and consent</ins>](https://cpd.uco.ac.uk/cervical-spine-risk-assessment-and-consent-for-manual-therapists-30-january-2021) \( **Source** **5b**\), which ran 9 times between 2017 and 2020 with 258 osteopaths and other health practitioners. IFOMPT recommended changes to decision\-making processes for cervical spine manipulation \(Rushton et al 2020\) and recommended that practitioners should now avoid provocative testing. This guidance has been integrated into courses which cover shared decision\-making, informed consent, medico\-legal frameworks, and safety issues for practitioners who teach cervical spine manipulation techniques. 

 The GOsC commissioned a follow\-up study to McGivern et al \(2015\), which recently reported that attitudes to EBP within the profession have changed in response to guidance from research\-active OEIs \( **Source 6**  [<ins> **McGivern et al 2020**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pec-october-2020-item-9-mcgivern-research/)\). UCO contributions to this sea change include SV’s involvement in NICE \(2016\) guideline development, which increased national awareness of EBP for back pain and supported his subsequent contribution to the  [<ins>National Back Pain Pathway,</ins> ](https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/charles-greenough/)which guided EB implementation by national CCGs. In the UCO, changes in clinical training since 2017 require students to identify use of guidelines in their documented patient assessment and management plans. Recent qualitative research reported increased awareness and positive attitudes, but continued lack of confidence in using EBP **\(Source 7**  [<ins> **Inman and Thomson 2019**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2019.01.001)\), indicating a need for further skills training \(Case Study 2\). The UK survey of attitudes to EBP \( [<ins>Sundberg et al 2018</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-018-2354-6)\) was replicated in Australia \( **Source 8**  [<ins> **Leach et al 2019**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4329-1)\), and subsequently in Sweden, Spain and Italy, which raised osteopaths’ awareness internationally. Similar findings in several countries has prompted research into barriers to EBP implementation, with future impact anticipated from a recently published systematic review protocol \( [<ins>Sampath et al 2020</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2020.01.001)\). 

 In the UK, osteopaths deliver paediatric care for approximately 1 in every 9\-11 children, but there is limited evidence about manual therapy effects on infants and parents and carers. Many infants treated by osteopaths have symptoms of colic including excessive crying, unsettled, distressed or difficult to console, but evidence of effect is limited \(Carnes et al 2018\). A recent systematic review indicated favourable but weak evidence for crying time \( **Source 9**  [<ins> **Ellwood et al 2020**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035405)\), highlighting an urgent need for new research. This led to the development of CUTIES, the Crying Unsettled and disTressed Infants Effectiveness Study of osteopathic care \( **Source 10**  [<ins> **Carnes et al 2020**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2020.08.001)\). This two\-arm, multi\-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial is recruiting 112 infants, randomised to receive best practice advice and support plus either specific or non\-specific \(control\) light touch manual therapy. Parents are blinded to group and outcomes include crying time over 14 days, parent satisfaction, adverse events and cost. Results anticipated in 2022 will generate evidence about treatment effect and provide the Advertising Standards Authority with data to assess the validity of advertising osteopathy for this common, distressing paediatric condition.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Scottish Highlands has for centuries been a culturally\-rich and internationally\-connected region, but since the 1700s it has been more frequently characterised as peripheral. Research from the Centre for History \(CfH\) at the University of the Highlands and Islands \(UHI\) has challenged this characterisation, emphasising instead human agency: the vitality and resilience, sometimes against the odds, of the region’s social and linguistic communities. This research has then helped change cultural practice in the Highland Council locality, the largest local government area in the U.K. High Life Highland \(HLH\), the partner for the case study, is a service delivery organisation providing cultural, leisure, and learning services on behalf of the Council. HLH has incorporated this new understanding from our research in its approach to its museums, libraries, and archives. CfH research has underpinned several collaborative projects with HLH since 2015, and influenced the concept and application of the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’, the organising principle for the multi\-million pound Inverness Castle Project, the biggest single heritage development in the region of the last century. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research has been carried out in public and regional history by Hunter, Worthington, and, in particular, MacPherson. It focuses on and contextualises the agency of the region’s often marginalised communities \[3.1\]. 

 The Centre for History \(CfH\) has developed an approach to collaborative research which emphasises the historical resilience of the Highland people and the ways in which this can effect positively on cultural, social, and economic development. This agency has too often been overlooked in accounts which focus on the long\-lasting, destructive aftermath of the Battle of Culloden, on the Highland Clearances, and on emigration. Hunter has argued that an appreciation of the Highlands’ rich and diverse history over the longer term is essential if people in the region are to have a sustainable future \[3.2\]. Worthington has formulated an historiographical approach that responds to the varied work of scholars including Rod Aya, Walter Johnson, and Jon Wilson since the 1990s, all of whom have used ‘agency’ as an umbrella term to describe collective responses among marginalised communities. Worthington has applied this to show how cultural and social influences have travelled southwards from the northern, ‘Highland’ littoral of the Moray Firth to its southern, ‘Lowland’ edge, as much as vice versa, reversing most previous assumptions \[3.3\]. The work of MacPherson takes direct inspiration from Hunter’s pivotal re\-evaluation of Highland communities and applies these concepts of agency to collaborative research which empowers those same communities to effect social, economic, and cultural change. MacPherson has pioneered a collaborative mode of PhD supervision and research which has put into place a practice\-based philosophy that is unique in a sub\-national context in Scotland \[3.1\]. Drawing on elements of postcolonial thought, it is based on principles of public history that give power to local people, enabling them to become agents in the creation of knowledge. 

 A bridge towards the impact that has occurred was the awarding of an AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award funded studentship, Badenoch Textiles, led by MacPherson, and founded on the research principles described above. This saw co\-production of CfH research with an HLH\-run museum, the Highland Folk Museum \(HFM\). The project highlighted the importance of flax growing to the Highland economy and the region’s place within global and imperial commercial markets and intellectual culture in the eighteenth century. By using eighteenth\-century techniques for flax growth and production, it explored how a ‘learning by doing’ approach could help HFM to become involved in the research process and drive forward their public engagement activities both at regional and national level.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Distilling the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ with High Life Highland since 2015** 

 After centuries of being marginalised, the Highlands has begun to experience some signs of cultural revival, in which the Centre for History and High Life Highland’s collaborations have been vital. The CfH’s research on Highland agency influencing the approach and activities of HLH via a chain of interlocking events initiated at the Kingussie Heritage Festival of 2015: the abovementioned Badenoch Textiles project, which started later that year, and its outcomes, along with a range of interconnecting influence on cultural practice in Highland museums, libraries and archives. Assisted by this, a new concept – the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ – is today manifested in the form of the Inverness Castle Project. In the words of the Head of Service at HLH until 2019: “ *History is about people, their actions, and their responses: their ‘agency’ if you like, this being a term that Centre for History researchers have used in showing the vitality of Highland communities in the past. And in the Highlands, this is a magnificent and uplifting story that also has a present and a future. For me, this is what the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ encapsulates*” \[5.1\]. 

 By working with HLH, an organisation with nearly 800 full\- and part\-time staff as of early 2020, the CfH has fulfilled a shared aim of making co\-produced academic research more accessible to the general public, and of placing the region’s collective agency and ‘spirit’ to the fore to ensure cultural renewal. Senior managers at HLH’s museums, libraries and archives – the Highland Folk Museum, Inverness Library, and Highland Archive Centre, in particular – have prioritised the benefits that have accrued from practice\-based partnerships with us since 2015, as will be shown. This has altered HLH’s approach to their cultural assets and helped them embed local cultural facilities into their communities. It has also supported closer connections between them and national cultural institutions. 

 **Oil, putty and paint: a flagship study of how CfH research gave a national platform to cultural practice in a regional organisation** 

 CfH collaborative work with HLH commenced at the Kingussie Heritage Festival in 2015, an event which brought together local heritage bodies, including the Clan Macpherson Museum. The presentation of research concepts via community\-focused public history was attended by HLH’s Head of Service and the CfH’s MacPherson, who identified common ground. Discussions between them and others present inspired a strategic partnership between HLH and UHI and new collaborations between HLH and both Historic Environment Scotland \(HES\) and the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\). The Badenoch Textiles project, which emerged from the Kingussie discussions – and for which MacPherson was Director of Studies – allowed for firmer connections to be made between HLH and these national bodies. First, it helped HLH “ *expand and deepen our relationship with Historic Environment Scotland*” according to their Curatorial Manager at the time \[5.4, p.1\]. The doctoral research, based at the Highland Folk Museum \(HFM\), led to the museum and a researcher being funded to cultivate and harvest flax using eighteenth\-century techniques. This was of great interest to the technical branch of Historic Environment Scotland \(HES\), which has a strong sustainability agenda built, in part, around increasing the use of traditional building materials. Indeed, they had a key objective of experimenting in the production and use of traditional, non\-lead\-based paint from linseed oil, which is produced from flax. Inspired by the flax project’s research, which the key member of HES’s technical research team involved considered an essential “ *academic stepping stone*” for them \[5.3, p.9\], they produced linseed oil from two annual harvests of the flax. One batch went to the Engine Shed, Scotland’s dedicated building conservation centre, which emphasises training and education, while HES turned a second batch into putty and paint for The Ridge charity in Dunbar \[5.3\]. This community interest company, which works with socially\-excluded groups to offer them skills training, acquired a derelict complex of eighteenth\-century buildings which they are rebuilding in partnership with HES. The output of CfH research, in the form of putty and paint, was used in the restoration of the windows \[5.3\]. 

 **Inspiring HLH’s approach to the region’s ‘spirit’: museums, libraries and archives** 

 From there, our research helped inspire new collaborations linking the communities of Badenoch, the CfH, and the Highland Folk Museum \(HFM\). According to the HLH Curatorial Manager at the time, it expanded the range and depth of HLH’s working practices, the ways it communicates with the public, and its collaboration with external agencies. While embedding doctoral research in the curatorial work of museums is common practice at national\-level institutions, such an approach has had limited application at regional or local levels. But the former Curatorial Manager considered that the CfH’s work showed a capacity “ *for bringing research to bear on contemporary issues*” \[5.4, p.1\]. In much the same way that Historic Environment Scotland used the material outcomes of CfH practice\-led research with socially excluded groups, HFM developed aims of establishing “ *a centre for learning and teaching … of traditional rural skills*” \[5.5, p.17\] that would empower marginalised people, bringing the museum also additional income, employment, and further research opportunities \[5.4, 5.5\]. Enhanced confidence and dedicated work by the HFM staff brought recognition of the museum as ‘nationally significant’ by Museums & Galleries Scotland \(MGS\). This was followed by a successful application to MGS for a grant, invested in two HFM staff to undertake work on conservation and documentation, a focus apparent also in the museum’s ‘20 Year Vision’ statement in 2016, in which collaborative research with universities rose to the fore. A shift in practice had occurred, from cataloguing to research, that, as the then\-HLH Head of Service stated, had *“in part come out of the partnership we have had with the university”* \[5.6, p.11\]. 

 Moving beyond the HFM, as a result of working with CfH, senior managers at HLH had also authorised the loan of the Inverness Library collection of rare books written by James Macpherson \(1736\-1796\) to the 2015 Festival in Kingussie, allowing the people of Badenoch to engage intellectually and physically with these works in ways that they had not done before. Here too, CfH research on Highland agency had a transformative effect on staff and institutional attitudes, engaging them with an eighteenth\-century, local author, James Macpherson, who is of global significance. This demonstrated the cultural value of HLH’s collections and drove HLH’s strengthening relations with another national organisation, in this case the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\). According to the current Head of Culture at HLH, special collections are “ *an absolute headache and a nightmare for public libraries*” \[5.5, p.1\]. This situation was transformed for them, however, by the CfH’s research, which revealed to senior library managers the value of bringing the special collections to the public. It involved ’Meet the Books’ events run by CfH staff in collaboration with other UHI researchers, which attracted capacity attendances, excellent feedback, and enhanced senior managers’ understanding of the collections \[5.5\]. CfH\-led collaborative research was, HLH’s Head of Culture asserts, “ *giving me real food for thought about how in future we can facilitate/publicise the whole process again*” \[5.5, p.4\]. Such new\-found awareness of the latent power of Inverness Library’s special collections took HLH’s cultural services in three directions. Firstly, it led to the idea of a ‘centre for the book’, which they would propose as part of the Inverness Castle Project \(see below\) and which could integrate academic and “ *public learning; teaching; public engagement*” \[5.5\]. The second direction was to draw library staff and volunteers further into the research process through staff development sessions, creating “ *a new model*” that “ *can be replicated throughout our entire cultural \[provision\] right across the Highlands*” \[5.5, p.14\]. Thirdly, CfH research strengthened the relationship between Highland library services and the National Library of Scotland \(NLS\), raising awareness of the significance of their special collections, with the NLS confirming to HLH that their social and historical context made them particularly precious \[5.5\]. 

 Another HLH priority is the Highland Archive Centre \(HAC\), with whom the CfH ran five collaborative events between 2017 and 2020. On three occasions, these were accompanied by exhibitions of archival material which had been used in our recent publications, towards inspiring further collaborative research. First, in March 2017, CfH staff co\-organised, along with the Imperial War Museum, ‘Researching the Impact of the First World War on the Highlands and Islands’, an event at which CfH and HAC staff both presented along with numerous other national and local historians and archivists; there was a lunchtime exhibition at HAC of relevant holdings, while two major follow\-ups would take place, one at HAC and the other in Lewis. The second occasion relates to the archival collections of the Caledonian Societies of Kenya and Zanzibar, donated by a CfH alumnus in 2013, and the focus of a 2017 display at HAC held in conjunction with an introduction to the archives for the public and a lecture on Scotland’s Imperial past and relevant records in the archive by CfH visiting professor, John MacKenzie. The third occasion was a sold\-out book launch and lecture in Inverness Town House for a 2019 work by Professor Hunter, chaired by Worthington, and at which material from HAC that Hunter had used in his research was, similarly, displayed. As the Highland Archivist at HAC states: “ *On each occasion, these collaborations have given us the opportunity to share our archives with new audiences … The partnership with the UHI Centre for History is one which we greatly value as it enables us to promote, publicise, and grow engagement with the archives in our care*.” Furthermore, as she expresses it, the CfH’s research “ *plays a vital role in highlighting the spirit of the Highlands and the lives of the people who call, and have called, this area home*” \[5.7\]. 

 **Manifesting the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’: the Inverness Castle Project** 

 Ultimately, and through the concept of the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’, our research has led to the CfH taking up a vital role, alongside HLH, in the largest, most expensive cultural project ever undertaken in the Highlands: the Inverness Castle Project. This is a collaboration that has been supported at the highest strategic level of the partner organisation, embracing academic research by university\-based academics. As HLH’s former Head of Service expressed it, the “ *symbiotic relationship”* \[5.2, p.3\] with UHI’s research was a backdrop to the ‘Officers Group’ of the Castle Project after 2015, as they came up with a ‘hook’ that would bring in the region’s stories and ensure the political support to be obtained. This hook was the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’, a concept now central to the Castle Project \[5.2\]. 

 CfH research, and its application to working with the region’s museums, libraries, and archives since 2015, has helped convince HLH of the need for a new, research\-led cultural approach. This new vision for the organisation is visible today in the Castle Project. The project forms part of the Inverness and Highland City\-Region deal, which is now in full progress, and which will see up to £315 million investment from the UK and Scottish governments aimed at stimulating sustainable economic growth regionally, with £15 million of this going directly to Castle Hill. The Castle Project is creating a gateway for tourism and becoming an anchor for economic growth in the city and throughout the region, and the content for the attraction thereby created celebrates, above all, the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ \[5.8\]. The project runs over three phases: Phase One involves the development of the North and South tower of the current Castle; Phase Two envisages the building of a new, adjacent visitor attraction on Castle Hill to an international standard; Phase Three is the commercial aspect. The net result is intended to be “ *a large cultural hub in the centre of Inverness which …will lead down to the archive centre, to the library, cultural trails*” \[5.5, p.9\]. 

 CfH research has had a significant physical impact on Castle Hill already, with Worthington acting as one of two historical consultants for the bilingual English and Gaelic text on the Castle hoardings, which went on display on the current exterior in September 2020. The narrative for the hoardings focuses on a fictional character, Flora, a young girl, and her enthusiasm for the Castle’s and the Highlands’ past. The involvement of Worthington comes in part from a 2019 Scottish Graduate School for the Arts and Humanities\-funded workshop he organised. At this event, HLH’s Head of Culture highlighted to the audience – including senior curatorial staff at National Museums Scotland – the inspiration provided to the project by UHI research. The newly\-appointed Creative Director of the Castle Project also talked about the historical elements of the development, emphasising the importance of the CfH’s and broader UHI research practices as the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ began to materialise \[5.9\] **.** This influence is further evidenced by Worthington representing UHI on the Inverness Castle Project Delivery Group, chaired by the Scottish Government’s Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy and Tourism, Fergus Ewing MSP. Moreover, Worthington’s leadership of the UHI\-HLH advisory group to the project, established in 2018, distributes agency further, focusing on how the CfH’s community\-oriented research can be applied in a wider, cross\-disciplinary way. 

 CfH researchers have positioned their work as a fulcrum around which relations between the Castle Project team and the university hinges, challenging the entrenched opinion that the marginalisation of the region and its voices is irreversible. Finally, in this regard, the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ is involving HLH’s gathering and curation of at least 100 ‘stories’ from across the region, a process launched online in September 2020, with a video narrated by multi\-award winning Gaelic singer and composer, Julie Fowlis. Fowlis affirmed, shortly after, that *“historical research at UHI has been an inspiration to me as an artist in recent times, particularly through their work showing the strength, agency and spirit of Highland people, past and present”*. Soon after, Fergus Ewing MSP asserted that *“the involvement of the UHI, and in particular its Centre for History, has already brought huge benefits to this project in helping research and display the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’ stories’”* \[5.10\]. The stories will provide the content for the visitor attraction on Castle Hill and the CfH will take a significant role in their selection. In this way, our research continues to inspire the ‘Spirit of the Highlands’, helping it materialise as the framework for a project that is having tangible, transformative effects on the region’s cultural life, on a scale bigger than that of any other development of the last century.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Green\-lean and lean logistics research by the University of Derby’s Centre for Supply Chain Improvement \(CSCI\) \(Garza\-Reyes; Anosike; Nadeem\) has addressed productivity and environmental challenges in distribution activities in the logistics, manufacturing and emergency medical service industries. CSCI’s research and engagement with non\-profit and private organisations, both nationally and internationally, including companies from Mexico, China, Thailand, Colombia and Oman, has principally generated management and environmental impacts, including: 

 \(a\) changed approaches to the management of resources; 

 \(b\) improved service delivery and productivity; 

 \(c\) enhanced processes and reduction of inefficient process; 

 \(d\) improved environmental performance; 

 \(e\) informed professional and educational exchanges. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research comprises work produced by the Centre of Supply Chain Improvement \(CSCI\) since 2013. The wider body of work includes over 50 journal papers, 19 conference papers, and 7 projects, funded by the British Council, British Academy, Innovate UK, and the Mexican Council of Science and Technology \(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Technología \- CONACYT\), as well as private sector partners. The research relates to the development and application of lean production principles into new contexts and addresses growing environmental concerns. 

 It began with Garza\-Reyes’ research recognising that lean could be adopted in logistics contexts to generate efficiencies, eliminate wastes and improve the environmental impact of organisations, contributing significantly to the notions of *green\-lean* and *lean logistics*. Road transportation emerged as a particular focus for Garza\-Reyes’ research, not least as it has attracted attention for being ecologically/environmentally detrimental. The research addresses important global and national challenges, particularly surrounding environmental and productivity priorities established by the UK’s Industrial Strategy and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, e.g. Decent Work and Economic Growth \(Goal 8\), Sustainable Cities and Communities \(Goal 11\) and Climate Action \(Goal 13\). 

 A comprehensive systematic literature review \[3.1\], conducted by Garza\-Reyes unveiled a conceptual and empirical gap in the consolidation of lean principles despite the mounting green agenda. This gap was pronounced within the road transportation context. This research acted as a catalyst for the green\-lean and lean logistics movements. Developing this research agenda, Garza\-Reyes \[3.2\], developed a systematic framework, based on a case study approach, with industry partners in Mexico \(and funded by the British Council \[G3.1\] and British Academy \[G3.2\]\). This extended a leading model \(Villareal, 2012\) of ‘Transportation Value Stream Mapping’ \(TVSM\) to consider environmental wastes and the particular characteristics of specialised logistics operations, e.g. ambulance/emergency medical services. Through published research \[3.3\], Garza\-Reyes introduced the notion of ‘Sustainable Transportation Value Stream Mapping’ \(STVSM\). This identified particular environmental wastes relevant to the transportation context, and Ambulance Transportation Value Stream Mapping \(A\-TVSM\) \[3.4\] \(theorising from the case study data\). 

 The application of STVSM into various world\-leading organisations \[3.3\] has resulted in improving performance efficiencies, e.g. productivity, administrative availability, clients served, quality \(reduction of returns, clients not served\); reducing distance, fill losses, labour time and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This created confidence in the further development of this research area and underpinned funded projects, led by Garza\-Reyes and Anosike, into other contexts \(agriculture\) \[G3.3\]. More recently, CSCI’s work developed into the emergency medical services \(EMS\) transportation \(i.e. ambulance\) context where Garza\-Reyes identified that, whilst lean was well adopted in healthcare, it had not been in an EMS transportation context \[3.4\]. The work has also been applied in Fast Moving Consumer Goods settings \[3.5\]. Approaches to identifying relevant wastes and piloting their implementation in a process of co\-design with stakeholders were identified \[G3.4\]. 

  

 The underpinning research and wider body of research have not only refined the green\-lean concept but resulted in a pioneering green\-lean toolkit that, through a process of applied research, has been iteratively developed and implemented in a range of organisations.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Environmental, practitioner and organisational impact in road transport logistics** 

 The development of the STVSM by Garza\-Reyes and his guided implementation in several private sector companies has led to environmental, practitioner and organisational impact in the UK and internationally. In OXXO FEMSA, which is the largest chain of convenience stores in Latin America with over 18,000 stores, Garza\-Reyes’ research \[3.2\] led to sustainable indicators being introduced and, under the guidance of Garza\-Reyes, the re\-engineering of truck routing processes. This resulted in ‘distance travelled in excess’ reducing to nil, fill loss reducing from 71% to 54.9%, and a 40% reduction of trucks needed to serve daily demand. This also resulted in non\-environmental improvements, including 40% reduction in transport operation costs and serving time from circa 41 minutes to 18.7 minutes \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

 By utilising the STVSM framework, in DHL Transport Operations \(Monterey, Mexico\), Garza\-Reyes’ and his research partners reduced excess distance by 57%, resulting in secondary environmental impacts \(such as the reduction of harmful gas emissions\) \[3.3\]. Under the guidance and supervision of Garza\-Reyes, his postgraduate students Mr Litao Lou, Mrs Khemchira Kaitwatcharachai and Mr Krishna Balaji and companies’ employees respectively applied the STVSM framework at: \(1\) HPF Co., Ltd., one of the most well\-known medium size 3PL companies in Shenzhen, China; \(2\) ThailandPost Distribution Co., Ltd., a full\-service transportation and distribution provider and affiliate of the Thai Post Company Limited \(Thailand Post\); and \(3\) Chandra Transports, a traditional third\-party logistics service provider operating in Tamil Nadu, India. As an example of impact on practitioners or future practitioners through pedagogy, Garza\-Reyes’ students benefitted from his innovative green\-lean, applied pedagogic practice, gaining valuable practical experience through adapting the STVSM framework to solve real business problems. Indeed, in the three cases, STVSM helped the companies in identifying wastes and inefficiencies in their logistics processes, which consequently allowed them to change their practices accordingly to reduce costs and become more competitive \[5.3, 5.4, 5.5\]. 

 **Practitioner and health impacts in ambulance settings** 

 Working with Cruz Roja Mexicana \(Mexico’s Red Cross\) in two separate projects, CSCI was able to apply its research on lean logistics and, in particular, sustainable \(STVSM\) and ambulance transportation value stream mapping \(A\-TVSM\) \[3.4\], directly into the emergency medical context. 

  

 Project 1 focused on improving efficiency/agility and through the guided application of Garza\-Reyes’ research toolkit, the organisation saw improved ambulance response times \(response times within ten minutes increased from 16.4% to 58% post\-intervention\). Further, ambulance turnaround times increased by 34%, increasing services from 4 to 6 per 8\-hour shift \(i.e. creating capacity for two additional services in each shift\) \[5.6\]. 

 Project 2 focused on improving ambulance capacity by using lean principles and adopting the Theory of Constraints. With this knowledge and Garza\-Reyes’ methodology, ambulance operations were re\-routed following a facilitated process with internal stakeholders. Wastes such as over\-processing time were identified in facilitated sessions. As a result, a reduction of ambulance cycle and turnaround times by about 50 min/service was achieved, increasing ambulance capacity from 4 to a maximum of 6 services per shift. Additionally, emergency call coverage within 10 minutes increased from 37% to 85% and response time decreased by 10 min on average. This further increased the number of services per ambulance per shift from 6 to 7 \[5.7, pg. 269\]. These improved efficiencies created better outcomes for the delivery of emergency care with patients being able to access it and receive an enhanced experience. 

 **Extending the impact reach beyond road transportation** 

 In 2016, CSCI recontextualised its research into a slightly different context – agriculture. Garza\-Reyes led a British Council Institutional Links project in farming settings in Mexico \[G3.3\]. Whilst the project was multi\-faceted, CSCI delivered best practice exchanges and workshops to local businesses, universities and government organisations in Mexico, where delegates were trained on the green\-lean principles \[5.8\]. The project aimed to address outcomes relating to poverty and food security. 

 The commercial impact created by CSCI’s research is further demonstrated by its work with academic and industry partners in an iron ore shipping context in Oman. Working with a leading shipping company who had incurred GBP1m\+ penalties/demurrage fees, CSCI was able to develop and apply a lean framework which led to the reduction in commercial time \(a saving in excess of 30%\) and the reduction in demurrage fees by approximately USD300,000 \[5.9, pg. 1092; 1096; 1108\]. 

 **Practitioner and professional impacts through executive education** 

 The research has also been used in a host of educational exchanges with professional and practitioner groups including professional bodies. CSCIs research has led to its engagement with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport \(CILT\) and its Logistics Research Network \(LRN\), and CSCI hosting and chairing CILTs LRN conference in 2016. The research has gained the attention of the CILT in the UK and work is currently underway to embed the research in their resources *.*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 MacAskill’s research on effective altruism led to millions of pounds in donations to charity. It motivated billionaire Ben Delo to pledge over USD500,000,000 to effective charities over his lifetime. The research also had a large influence on setting up the Long\-term Future Effective Altruism Fund, which has paid out more than USD4,000,000 to charitable purposes to this day. MacAskill has also reached a large public audience through several high\-profile podcasts and a TED talk, drawing dozens of people into the effective altruism movement with a commitment to improve human and animal wellbeing. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Between 2015 and 2020, MacAskill and Ord have been carrying out desk research in moral philosophy to answer the most important questions regarding institutional, philanthropic and individual action to maximise impartial welfare. This came in two categories: the foundations of effective altruism, and decision\-making under moral uncertainty. 

 **Foundations of effective altruism**  Effective altruism uses evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others by as much as possible and taking action on that basis. For example: if you want to donate to charity, which charity will do the most good \(impartially considered\), with your donation? Or if you want to pursue a career that has a positive impact on the world, which career paths will have the biggest impact? 

  

 Research carried out by MacAskill between 2015 and 2019, including *The Definition of Effective Altruism* \[1\], *Effective Altruism: Introduction* \[2\], and *Understanding Effective Altruism and its Challenges* \[3\] further developed and defined the concept of ‘effective altruism’. This research enabled improved understanding of what implications these ideas have on contemporary debates in shaping altruistic actions to maximise impartial welfare. His research has helped distinguish effective altruism from related concepts, like utilitarianism, show how morally ecumenical effective altruism is, and respond to common misconceptions about effective altruism, such as that it is unable to account for ‘systemic change.’ 

  

 **Decision\-making under moral uncertainty** 

 Second, decision\-making under moral uncertainty. Very often we are uncertain about what we ought, morally, to do. So how should we make decisions in the face of such uncertainty? This is a crucial theoretical issue for someone who is engaged in the project of effective altruism because it impacts so heavily on the question of *cause\-prioritisation*: if you want to do the most good, should you try to improve the health of the world’s poorest people, try to reduce the risk of 

 civilizational catastrophe from climate change, or do something else? One’s answer to this question will depend on fundamental moral issues, like how to value the interests of future generations against the present generation. We don’t, currently, know the answers to those questions. But we still need to act, despite our uncertainty. The theory of decision\-making under moral uncertainty allows us to make more rational and reasoned decisions, despite that uncertainty. 

  

 Between 2015 and 2020, MacAskill and Ord generated a novel account of how correctly to make decisions under moral uncertainty, as outlined in the following works: *Moral Uncertainty* \[4\] *, Statistical Normalization Methods in Interpersonal and Intertheoretic Comparisons* \[5\], and *Practical Ethics Given Moral Uncertainty* \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of this research falls into two main areas: \(1\) public policy, law and services; \(2\) understanding, learning and participation. 

  

###  Diverting institutional philanthropic resources towards more effective causes 

 MacAskill’s research on effective altruism between 2015 and 2019 has influenced the work of NGOs and other organisations by directing philanthropic resources towards more effective causes. Key examples of these are listed below: 

  

-  MacAskill’s research on effective altruism \(especially research item 1\) led several philanthropists, including billionaire Ben Delo, to direct their donations towards charities working in the field of effective altruism. \[A\] Ben Delo has, as a result of MacAskill’s research, joined the Giving Pledge in 2019 and committed to donate the majority of his wealth to long\-term oriented effective altruistic causes. \[B\] Effective Giving UK, who advise Ben Delo, state: “Based on Prof. MacAskill’s research, our advisee and the UK’s youngest self\-made billionaire, Ben Delo, pledged to donate the majority of his wealth \(over USD500,000,000\) to work to safeguard future generations and protect the long\-term prospects of humanity. In Mr. Delo’s Giving Letter, he explicitly cites Prof. MacAskill’s work on effective altruism \[...\] as influential to his giving strategy.” Ben Delo learned about MacAskill’s unpublished work through having personal conversations with him. On the Giving Pledge website, Delo states, “My approach is inspired by philosopher William MacAskill and the effective altruism movement, which promotes the use of reason and evidence when deciding how best to help others \[...\]. In short, I believe that all lives are valuable, including those of future generations.” \[A\] 

-  After MacAskill’s research on effective altruism was featured on the Making Sense Podcast with Sam Harris, \[C\] Harris decided to pledge 10% of his personal earnings as well as USD3,500 of the organisation’s income to effective charities, by signing the Giving What We Can Pledge. \[D, page 348\] The podcast has approximately 1,000,000 downloads per episode. 

-  Based on his research, MacAskill advised the Centre for Effective Altruism in establishing a fund for individual donors, directed to the long\-term future. The Centre for Effective Altruism is an Oxford\-based charity working in support of the effective altruism community in bringing about positive changes in how we improve the world. MacAskill co\-founded the organisation in 2011. The Executive Director of the Centre for Effective Altruism said: “MacAskill’s research was \[sic\] vital input in establishing the Long\-Term Future Fund.” \[E\] The Long\-Term Future Fund has raised more than USD4,800,000, of which over USD4,100,000 was paid out between March 2017 and November 2020 for charitable purposes. \[F\] 

###  Diverting lay public resources towards more effective causes 

 MacAskill and Ord’s research has contributed to enhancing understanding of issues in effective charity and decision\-making on the benefits of giving to evidence\-based charities. He has stimulated public interest and engagement in altruistic decision\-making, increased awareness of these areas and challenged norms in the area of effective ways to improve welfare. Below are some of the key examples of how this has been achieved. 

  

-  In April 2018, MacAskill argued the moral importance of the long\-term future in a TED talk on the concept of effective altruism \[A, B, C\], released on the TED website. \[G\]The talk has been watched almost 2,000,000 times and has been picked up by popular news and public intellectuals, including Max Tegmark, famous author, physicist, cosmologist and machine learning researcher on Twitter. Tegmark writes, “This was one of my favorite 2018 TED talks: let's not only do good but pick our battles wisely\!” \[G\] 

-  MacAskill presented his research on moral uncertainty \[research items 4, 5, 6\] on popular podcasts over the period 2015\-2019, including the 80,000 Hours podcast \(circa 26,000 downloads\), The Tim Ferriss Show, Very Bad Wizards, and the AI Alignment Podcast.\[H\] Some of these appearances popularised MacAskill’s research, and led to changes in the audience’s donation behaviours and careers \- such as a survey respondent starting an MPhil in a related field after listening to a podcast of MacAskill’s on Moral Uncertainty. \[L\] 

-  MacAskill encouraged people to join the effective altruism movement, and to dedicate more of their time and money towards effective charity. In a survey by the Effective Altruism Forum of their members in 2019, respondents were asked how they had first heard of effective altruism, 72 people \(63% of 115 open comments\) cite MacAskill’s podcast appearances, and 4 people \(5% of 76 open comments\) cite MacAskill’s TED talk \[I\]. The mean donation to effective charities per survey respondent was USD6,407 \(calculation: USD16,100,000 total donations \[J\] among 2513 respondents \[K\].\) One of the survey respondents who was influenced by reading MacAskill’s work said “I now donate 10% of my income” to charities and causes “such as the Against Malaria Foundation and efforts to reduce existential risk.” \[L\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne illness in the UK, with the societal burden estimated as costing approximately GBP710,000,000 annually. RVC quantified the effect of easy\-to\-deploy enhanced biosecurity and flock management measures in reducing campylobacter colonisation of chickens.  This has guided recommendations made by the National Farmers Union, Food Standards Agency and British Poultry Council and led to revisions to Red Tractor and retailer standards. Consequently, >95% of UK poultry producers \(farming almost one billion birds annually\) now apply these measures, resulting in significantly improved food safety, a reduction in societal burden of foodborne illness and positive benefits to the poultry industry, retailers, the economy and human health. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research on *Campylobacter* spp. in poultry, led by Professor Javier Guitian at the RVC, has provided strong quantitative evidence of the effect of poultry management factors on carcass contamination with campylobacter. This work was commissioned by the Food Standards Agency \(FSA\) to inform their strategic priorities for campylobacter control and included detailed statistical analysis of an industry\-led trial \[1, 2\]. 

 The effect of enhanced biosecurity, key management factors such as partial depopulation \(thinning\), number of empty poultry house days between flocks and the type of breed on campylobacter colonisation of chicken broilers were investigated \[1, 2\]. The findings provided the industry not only with evidence that these factors independently influenced risk of campylobacter colonisation, but also a quantifiable expectation of the effect in terms of degree of carcass colonisation and therefore public health impact of modifying each. 

 This comprehensive analysis was followed by modelling carcass contamination parameterised using published data \(including that from references 1 and 2\) \[3\], for in\-silico evaluation of the control measures identified in the intervention as well as control strategies being investigated but not yet fully implemented. This included strategies aimed at increasing resistance to colonization such as vaccines and feed additives and aimed at reducing bacterial load in colonized birds such as bacteriophages or bacteriocins. The resulting model simulation reinforced the findings of the industry intervention demonstrating how enhancement of biosecurity and cessation of thinning can be expected to be much more effective at reducing the number of UK flocks classified as ‘highly contaminated’ \(>1000 colony forming units/g \[cfu/g\]\) at point of slaughter than other strategies initially anticipated to be more valuable \[3\]. 

 By combining comprehensive multivariable risk factor analysis based on controlled practical interventions and robust simulation modelling of the applications of these interventions across the UK poultry industry, this was the first research to convincingly quantify the likely independent effects of these on farm measures and their ability to reduce the proportion of highly contaminated carcasses.

 **Other Quality Indicators** 

 The quality of Professor Guitian’s research into food safety and its policy impact has led to him being able to attract funding from Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council \(BBSRC\), Medical Research Council \(MRC\) Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\), Food Standards Agency, European Food Standards Agency \(EFSA\), The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation \(FAO\) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \(BMGF\) and to recruit talented researchers to engage in this work. These researchers have developed under Guitian’s leadership and been appointed to important positions developing their independence in the field. 

 In 2017, Guitian took over leadership of a partnership between RVC and the UK’s Animal Plant Health Agency \(APHA\), providing academic scientific leadership and support to the APHA’s Epidemiological Sciences Group, being appointed to an honorary position at APHA.  In 2019, RVC and APHA were awarded a joint World Organisation for Animal Health \(OIE\) collaborating Centre for Risk Analysis and Modelling, evidence of RVC’s academic esteem in this area of epidemiological science. 

 The policy\-oriented nature of RVC’s food safety research is highlighted by the recruitment of Milen Georgiev, immediately after completion of a 3\-year training period as Veterinary Public Health Resident at the RVC in 2015, by the Food Standards Agency \(FSA\) where he is Team Leader in Meat Hygiene Policy, and the role of Matteo Crotta, postdoctoral researcher and first author of the simulation paper, as  member of the EFSA working group updating and reviewing control options for Campylobacter in broilers at primary production. RVC is supporting Matteo Crotta in his application for an FSA Fellowship \(Jan 2021\).  Wendy Beauvais, a third early career researcher involved in the campylobacter work, who was trained at the RVC \(MSc, Residency and PhD; 2010\-2016\), is now Assistant Professor in Veterinary Epidemiology and Public Health at Purdue University, College of Veterinary Medicine \(appointed in 2020 following a post\-doctoral position in Cornell\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne illness in the UK, with the societal burden estimated as costing approximately GBP710,000,000 annually \( [FSA, 2020](https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/media/document/the-burden-of-foodborne-disease-in-the-uk_0.pdf)\). In 2018, it was estimated that 43,000 cases presented to general practitioners and 3,500 people with campylobacter infection were hospitalised \( [FSA, 2020](https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/media/document/the-burden-of-foodborne-disease-in-the-uk_0.pdf)\). 

 The FSA identified reduction of campylobacter infection as a strategic priority and set up a Joint Working Group \(JWG\) in 2012, encompassing a wide variety of poultry industry partners and commercial organisations.  The results of Professor Guitian’s FSA\-commissioned research were presented at quarterly JWG meetings between 2012 and 2014 \[a\].  As a result of RVC findings, the JWG made a number of recommendations for changes to on\-farm biosecurity practices that were widely disseminated by organisations including the National Farmers Union \(NFU\) and British Poultry Council \(BPC\). These included a Campylobacter Biosecurity Guide poster produced by the FSA and National Farmers Union \(NFU\) which was made available to all UK poultry farmers freely and disseminated widely by NFU \[b\]. The research also informed the BPC’s Guide to Interventions \(published in 2014\), with regard to on farm biosecurity \[c\]. 

 Red Tractor Assurance is the UK’s largest farm assurance scheme, with >2000 poultry farms as members, which represent approximately 95% of the 1,000,000,000 growing chickens in the UK annually \[d\].  Biosecurity measures based on RVC’s research have been incorporated into revised Red Tractor standards, required for compliance with the scheme \[d\]. These cover parent stock, hatcheries, growers, transport, and slaughter, with the whole chain independently audited to ensure compliance \[d\]. The changes included: The biosecure area shown on the farm map; a physical barrier \(no less than 30cm high, removable/washable or replaceable\) in place before entering in areas that housed birds to ensure that the houses were not contaminated, \(designed to encourage behaviour change: replacing footwear, and cleaning and disinfecting before entering the house\); catchers and drivers to adhere to the Biosecurity Section of manual, and mechanical harvesters added to the list of equipment requiring cleaning and disinfection \[d\]. 

 These changes were proposed in 2013 following presentation of Professor Guitian’s results to the JWG. All Red Tractor members were informed prior to implementation in October 2014 \[d\].  Biosecurity was given more prominence and thus importance for the members in ensuring compliance, through a new and separate section within the standards \[d\]. Requirements that farmers had to meet were sub\-divided into more individual audit points to ensure consistency at audit, and clarity where corrective action was needed. Some standards were made “Key”, meaning that farms may be immediately suspended from the scheme if they are not being met at any time \[d\]. 

 \[Text removed for publication\] 

 Professor Guitian’s research also influenced Marks and Spencer’s decision to require its supply farms to cease thinning, as one of the actions in its 5\-point plan introduced in 2015 to reduce contamination of the carcasses of chickens with Campylobacter \[f\], a change which was publicised in the national and trade press \[g\].  This included \(but was not exclusive to\) articles in Food Manufacture, The Grocer, Food Service Footprint, Farming UK, Environmental Health News, Daily Mail and Daily Star \[g\]. 

 An M&S spokesperson said, *“At the time the food industry were under a great deal of political pressure to make changes to reduce the public health risk posed by contamination of chickens with campylobacter and Professor Guitian’s work gave us confidence that this measure would have an immediate and significant effect”* \[f\] *.* M&S subsequently permitted reintroduction of thinning – economically important for the industry \- after other measures, including enhanced biosecurity based on RVC’s research, and blast chilling of the carcass before packing were undertaken to maintain low carcass contamination \[f\]. The spokesperson further stated, *“The work conducted by Professor Guitian and his colleagues truly provided a strong basis for on farm measures to be developed further and gave us confidence that these would have significant beneficial effects.”* \[f\]. Publicly available M&S Campylobacter test results for chicken stocked on the shelves of M&S stores across the UK, show that between 2015 and 2019, the yearly average proportion of meat classed as heavily contaminated \(>1000cfu/g\) with campylobacter reduced from 11% to 2%, and the proportion of meat with <100cfu/g – the lowest level of campylobacter contamination indicated in publically reported retailer data – increased from 55% to 91% \[f\]. 

 In the UK as a whole, since dissemination of the JWG’s recommendations in leading industry\-wide change, the prevalence of *Campylobacter* spp. in chicken meat at retail reduced from 19.7% of highly contaminated batches in February 2014 to 3.8% in March 2018 \[h\]. Since 2017, the 9 major supermarket retailers have been mandated to publically report the test results for campylobacter contamination of UK\-produced fresh whole chickens they retail. Figures for April to June 2019 from these supermarkets show that only 3.6% of chickens tested positive for contamination of >1000cfu/g, which is below the FSA target maximum of 7% \[h\]. 

 The BPC \(whose member businesses account for approximately 90% of UK poultry production\) said *“Prior to these data being obtained and modelled by Professor Guitian there was a degree of scepticism in the industry as to whether enhancing biosecurity alone could make a difference. This work truly provided the foundation for future biosecurity practices in the industry and started progress towards the successful process of reducing contamination.* *Such changes have increased the number of negative flocks \(<10cfu/g\), which can only be attributed to on\-farm practices and have continued to gradually reduce campylobacter contamination in flocks overall. It is my view that enhanced biosecurity and rapid testing have played the most important part in reducing campylobacter contamination.”* \[c\]. 

 Circumstantial evidence supports beneficial effects of these changes on human health.  The number of reported cases in the UK per 100,000 population reduced by 14.8% between the rolling averages of 2011\-2014 and 2015\-2019 \[i\]. Furthermore, human exposure to poultry\-derived products contaminated with campylobacter is only likely to have increased due to increased consumption of poultry meat in recent years. Broiler production, import of poultry meat and poultry consumption per capita have all increased in the UK over these periods \( [AVEC 2017](https://www.avec-poultry.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AVEC-2017-BAT.pdf);  [AVEC 2020](https://avec-poultry.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/05691-AVEC-annual-report-2020.pdf)\). 

 In 2020, the EFSA published an updated opinion on Campylobacter which adopted the metric used by the RVC \[1\] to provide a measure of the proportion of campylobacter positive flocks estimated to be linked to a specific risk factor relating to changing farm management practices \[j\]. This updated ESFA opinion also cites this work in showing that a downtime of more than 2 weeks for increasing campylobacter infection in the next flock \(as campylobacter ingress is more likely to occur if strict biosecurity is not maintained in depopulated sheds\), and was the sole study cited to provide an estimate of the role of thinning based on empirical data \[j\]. 

 As such, RVC research laid the foundation for further development and refinement of on\-farm measures to reduce campylobacter contamination of the carcass at slaughter which, in part, have underpinned the success of the poultry industry in reducing carcass contamination and increasing food safety in the UK and beyond.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Professor Nigel Driffield of Warwick Business School contributed to the Greater Birmingham Region attaining record levels of inward investment, from companies such as HSBC, Changan Automotive and Jacobs Engineering. Prof. Driffield's research on the economics of international business was used to develop a strategy\-based approach to inward investment in the region that linked firm strategy, the value proposition that the region projects, and an understanding of the jobs created. His research underpinned a successful bid for GBP1,000,000,000 growth funds for Birmingham and the business case for devolution. The West Midlands Combined Authority's implementation of its economic, skills and productivity strategies has so far resulted in an almost 200% increase in new businesses locating to West Midlands and an average of just under 12,000 new jobs per year, more than any UK region outside London. 

 Both Brexit and the Covid\-19 pandemic are major challenges now facing the UK and the West Midlands. Driffield is a member of the West Midlands Brexit Commission, and the Coventry and Warwickshire LEPs reset strategy post covid, leading on the understanding of the economy and the prospects for future investment.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Nigel Driffield is Professor of International Business and Deputy Pro\-Vice\-Chancellor \(Regional Engagement\) at the University of Warwick. He has published more than 75 papers across a range of disciplines including international business, regional science, finance, and economics, and conducted research and projects for the World Bank, European Commission, UK Government departments including UKTI and BIS, and regional bodies in the UK. 

 Prof. Driffield's body of research explores the relationships between foreign direct investment, knowledge\-transfer and economic development, providing an understanding of the relationships between firm strategy, local labour markets, and national and local policy. His research is based on analysis of firm\-level data, often covering thousands of observations. Taken together, this work enables a region to understand the motivations behind firms investing in the area, thus supporting the region to understand its competitive position when seeking to attract such investment. Driffield’s research contributes to a better understanding of the beneficial effects of inward investment, most notably in terms of productivity and inclusive growth. 

 Funded by 2 substantial ESRC awards, Prof. Driffield’s research has had a strong West Midlands focus and has been built on theoretical and empirical contributions from his substantive work. He held a Leverhulme Professorial Fellowship for research into ‘Foreign direct investment, knowledge flows and local economic development’, which focused on global issues, developing both conceptual approaches to this issue as well as empirical findings. Collectively, the research focused on three main areas: 

 **Research on the regional impacts of foreign direct investments** 

 Many regions are chasing high\-tech inward investment. Yet, Prof. Driffield’s research has shown that the perceived gains of this approach, in terms of employment creation and productivity, are overstated, typically because the labour market is not able to supply the skilled workers required **\(3.1\-2\)**. Further research has demonstrated without exploring ownership structures, the research becomes disconnected from analyses of the motivations for Foreign Direct Investment \(FDI\) and performance **\(3.3\)**. 

 **Research on offshoring and re\-shoring** 

 The research considered the drivers behind opposite processes involved in the ambition to move activity to low\-cost locations and the increasing rate at which this is being reversed. The findings are underpinned by analysis of what localities can do to benefit from reshoring **\(3.2, 3.4\)**. The research showed, for example, that re\-shoring appears to be a serial activity, so firms who have done this once are more likely to repeat the process. The research extended to offshoring in the context of the threats to UK employment from Brexit **\(3.2, 3.4\)**. 

 **Research on inward investment and Brexit** 

 Prof. Driffield’s research **\(3.6\)** has shown that the most common issue that investment promotion agencies have sought to address from 2016 onwards is how to mitigate threats from Brexit. The findings indicate that inward investment into the UK is expected to fall by some 40%, irrespective of the form of Brexit. Unlike other work in this area, the research distinguishes between the volatile and stable states of the economy and accounts for the simultaneous effects that the frequency of FDI generates innately. The findings suggest that, this will fuel a prolonged negative impact on FDI **\(3.6\),** especially in advanced manufacturing, food technology and financial services, which are especially vulnerable under Brexit due to frictions in global value chains **\(3.2\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Birmingham city region accounts for over GBP120,000,000,000 of GDP \(compared with GBP170,000,000,000 in Scotland\)\), and about three quarters of the total West Midlands Combined Authority \(WMCA\) region. The creation of Local Enterprise Partnerships \(LEPs\), and subsequently the Mayoral West Midlands Combined Authority in 2016 \(tasked with improving economic performance of the area\), presented challenges for both governance and strategy development, with very little existing infrastructure. 

 “Six years ago the Greater Birmingham region was the economic laggard by any measure. The Greater Birmingham region is now an economic hotspot in the UK. The…key to the transformation of the GB economy has been the depth and breadth of our regional economic strategy … Prof Driffield \[‘s research\] was key to this strategy and *through this we were able to engage with Treasury and build a more constructive relationship with central government*.” \(Steve Hollis, then Chair, GBSLEP\) **\(5.1\)** 

 Professor Driffield was a finalist in the ESRC Celebrating Impact Prize 2017 in the Outstanding Impact in Business and Enterprise category. His research has resulted in the following impacts in the West Midlands: 

 **Influencing regional strategies to catalyse inward investment and growth**Prof. Driffield’s body of research directly informed the regional inward investment strategy \(later termed ‘The Greater Birmingham Project’\), influencing both the Strategic Economic Plan \(SEP\) and successful GBP1,000,000,000 bid for local growth funds. His research has informed both the formation and delivery of regional economic strategies, enabling the region to win record levels of inward investment in the 5 years since its introduction. This has been achieved through Driffield’s close collaboration with the Greater Birmingham & Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership \(GBSLEP\), where he serves as academic lead and is a member of the Economic Strategy Board \(2012\-\), and through his appointment as Deputy Chair of the Mayor's Productivity and Skills Commission \(PSC\) and membership of the executive for the SEP \(2017\-\). 

 The SEP **\(5.2\)** was underpinned by Prof. Driffield’s analysis **\(5.3\)**, aiming to target sectors such as advanced manufacturing, business, professional and financial services \(BPFS\) and tech and digital media by establishing the value proposition of the region to those sectors **\(5.4\)**. The analysis and expert insight **\(5.3;5.4\)**, provided a deep understanding of the magnitude of the likely benefits of targeting these sectors specifically, in terms of employment, productivity and exports. Early evidence demonstrated that a sectoral approach to regional inward investment strategy was effective at driving growth, which almost doubled by 2017 with GBP3,500,000,000 growth in gross fixed capital formations since the launch of regional strategies in 2015 **\(5.5\)**. Steve Hollis, then Chair of the GBSLEP, further affirms that Prof. Driffield’s research, “guided our GBSLEP Board \[in\] implementing policy interventions that have resulted in a marked increase in the GB region's attractiveness for inward investors …\[and that\] Professor Driffield has been instrumental in helping to shape the Greater Birmingham Project” **\(5.1\)**. 

 Wouter Schuitemaker, then Executive Director of West Midlands Growth Company \(WMGC\) with dual responsibilities of Investment Director \(inward investment\) and Commercial Director,   further corroborates that: “Y *our analysis* **\[5.3\]** *both confirms our approach and reassured the LEP board that our approach would bear fruit, giving them the confidence to get behind the strategy. The inward investment elements of both the Greater Birmingham Project and the Strategic Economic Plan bear witness to your analysis’* **\(5.6\)**. 

 Additionally, Prof. Driffield's positioning paper on GBSLEP's inward investment strategy post\-Brexit **\(3.2\)** formed part of Birmingham's successful bid for local growth funds **\(5.7\)**. The model developed by his research **\(3.1\)** that demonstrated the benefits of developing and communicating the region’s value proposition was locally applied by the WMGC to inform their business case for future funding from the WMCA Investment Committee and contributed to Birmingham's Economic Review in 2018 **\(5.4\)**. The WMCA business case was instrumental in securing a further GBP2,500,000 per annum between 2018\-2020. Neil Rami, Chief Executive at WMGC, stated: “Your points regarding the role of WMGC in both developing and communication the regions value proposition were well made, with reference to the evidence base, building on your research. Having someone with your experience and insight assisting us on this has been invaluable” **\(5.7\)**. 

 **Supporting devolution and regional economic development**Driffield's research **\(3.1\-6\)**, translated through his role as lead academic advisor to the WMCA’s SEP, formed part of the rationale for Greater Birmingham and West Midlands gaining devolution from Whitehall over economic policy. Driffield's research on local sector performance and the region's capacity for internationalisation, in terms of both exports and inward investment **\(5.3\)**, supported the West Midlands successful bid for devolution. Following devolution and the emergence of the WMCA, Driffield was invited as the academic lead on the WMCA 'Productivity and Skills Commission' \(PSC\). Subsequently, Prof. Driffield’s body of research **\(3.1\-6\)** has shaped the Commissions actions and recommendations including a skills strategy aligned to the region’s inward investment strategy, based around a value chain approach. This is evidenced by various contributions, including the call for evidence published by the WMCA that links strategies for economic growth to productivity and skills frameworks **\(5.8\).** 

 A joint report for PSC and WMGC **\(5.3\)**, informed by Driffield’s body of research **\(3.1\-6\)**, recommended that inward investment should target efforts on job creation, recognising the distinction between technology and more labour\-intensive activities, and that this could be achieved through the development of ‘sector networks’ in order to prepare firms for investment and strengthen the relationship between firms and inward investors. This report informed the regional approach, resulting in greater flows of investment, more opportunities for employment and job creation **\(5.9, p22\-25\)**. Dr Andy Palmer, then Chair of the PSC \(and former CEO of Aston Martin Lagonda\), acknowledged that Driffield’s “body of work **\[3.1\-6\]** has formed the evidence base for the Regional Skills Plan and the development of the emerging West Midlands local industrial strategy” **\(5.10\)**. Specifically, the work of the Commission led to the Regional Skills agreement, with GBP69,000,000 of funding from central government outlined in the local industrial strategy **\(5.11\)**. This work continues as the PSC has evolved into the WMCA Productivity and Skills Board, with Driffield appointed for a 3\-year term. 

 **Influencing regional and national foreign direct investment policy post\-Brexit** 

 Prof. Driffield’s work with UK Trade & Investment \(now the Department for International Trade\) and business investment agencies identified foreign firms with a high probability of expanding internationally. Driffield’s research \(based on early drafts of **3.1\-2,** available via  [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2775954](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2775954)\)\) was used during FDI debate in House of Commons on 12 Sept 2017 by Bill Esterson MP \(Sefton Central and Shadow Trade Minister\) who stated that: “The fall in the value of sterling has of course made it cheaper to invest here, but as Nigel Driffield and his colleagues point out, the benefits of a favourable exchange rate are set against the uncertainties of changes in our access to the EU. Their research also shows that investors like to return profits to their home countries, so a low\-cost investment may be of less interest than might appear at first glance” **\(5.12\)**. Together, this work helped the UK to attract 6 new firms, employing almost 10,000 people; this included HSBC relocating its headquarters to Birmingham, bringing over 1,000 jobs **\(5.5; 5.13\)**. Driffield is a member of the West Midlands Brexit Commission, leading on the understanding of the economy, and the prospects for future investment. By 2018 Greater Birmingham was designated as having the best strategy for attracting FDI of all large cites in Europe, according to fDi Magazine's European Cities and Regions of the Future ranking 2018 \- one of the industry's most prominent benchmark of FDI competitiveness **\(5.14\)**. In 2020, the West Midlands retained its position as the UK’s leading region outside London and the South East for attracting FDI, according to the Department for International Trade that demonstrated that the region accounts for 8% of the UK’s total new FDI projects **\(5.15\)**. 

 Building upon prior research **\(3.1; 3.2; 3.4\)**, and further supported by ESRC Covid\-19 response funding that involves working with investment promotion agencies and DIT on their investment strategy **\(grant 1\)**, Prof. Driffield’s research is being used to inform plans for economic recovery following the Covid\-19 pandemic. Driffield has been appointed by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee \(BEIS\) as a Specialist Adviser to its Post Pandemic Growth Inquiry. He is also on the advisory group advising the DIT on its inward investment strategy and, at a regional level, is central to the development of Coventry and Warwickshire LEP’s post\-Covid\-19 response strategy **\(5.16\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 We have **improved social, educational and employment opportunities** for 60,000 homeless people across the UK by collaborating **with three charitable organisations** to co\-develop the My Strengths Training for Life™ \(MST4Life™\) programme and, in doing so, securing them **better access to finance opportunities**. Participation in MST4Life™, the first sport psychology intervention delivered to homeless young people, has been shown to dramatically increase **social welfare and equality** for homeless people, increasing the likelihood by 30 percentage points that young people will exit homelessness through education, employment and training. The work has also been translated more broadly, improving the **mental health and well\-being** of 2,380,000 higher education students who now receive access to mental skills training via the Fika app. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Homelessness is a major social issue in the UK, costing the Government over £1b annually and resulting in the large\-scale deterioration of mental and physical health along with low life expectancy. Young people aged 16–24 are disproportionately affected, and problems will persist and escalate into adulthood unless those affected are supported to overcome their own multiple and complex barriers. **Our research has identified and described the mental skills and practices required to support healthy adolescent development in sport and physical activity, and we have pioneered adapting these approaches to improve the well\-being and social inclusion of homeless young people.** 

 Recognising a lack of mental skills as a key factor perpetuating homelessness, Cumming worked in partnership with the St Basils charity between 2014–2020 to co\-develop MST4Life™ \(MST: My Strengths Training\) — the first sport psychology programme delivered within a housing service to homeless young people. St Basils helps over 5,000 young people across the West Midlands each year, including Birmingham — a city whose level of youth homelessness was five times the national average in 2013–2014. 

 The key research findings underpinning MST4Life are as follows: 

 **KF1:** **Mental skills are essential if young people are to** **recover from homelessness, experience well\-being and thrive.** We have provided evidence of the successful and novel adaptation of using mental skills training to engage socially excluded homeless young people across a wide range of support needs \[R1\]. We also produced the first research to use a ‘person\-centred approach’ with homeless youth, to identify their own personal beliefs and associated mental strengths and to demonstrate that these strengths are associated with increased well\-being \[R2\]. 

 **KF2:** **Young people require a diverse set of personal and interpersonal mental qualities to be successful, and the nature, development and regulation of these qualities depends on features of the surrounding social environment** \[R3\]. The content and delivery style of MST4Life™ was directly informed by research undertaken by Cumming and Duda with the Scottish Institute of Sport Federation and Scottish Rugby \(2007–2010\), investigating how best to develop, implement and evaluate mental skills training interventions for youth in sport and dance. Significant others \(e.g., coaches, parents and sport administrators\) play an important role by creating an autonomy\-supportive climate for the development and implementation of mental skills and offering meaningful opportunities for the athletes to reflect on experiences \[R4\]. 

 **KF3: Using unfamiliar and challenging environments can be beneficial when providing mental skills training**. The ‘Messing About on the River’ project \(2011–2012\), co\-led by Cumming and Burns, identified the key factors influencing the transfer of mental skills from a training context \(e.g., an outdoor adventure education course\) to education and work opportunities \(e.g. transfer context\) for higher education students \[R5\]. Based on these findings, an outdoor adventure component was embedded within MST4Life™ to provide a meaningful opportunity for young homeless people to practise their self\-regulation abilities in an unfamiliar and challenging environment. They were then able to transfer these mental skills back to their supported accommodation environment and take positive steps towards living independently by addressing long standing health issues, becoming more involved with their community, and engaging with education, employment and training opportunities \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Improving social, educational and employment opportunities for homelessness people</ins> 

 By **widely collaborating with homelessness charities**, we have intensively supported homeless young people in Birmingham and, more broadly, across the UK, transforming their **quality of life**. We have worked with St Basils to embed MST4Life™ \[KF1–KF3\] into practice, along with Youth Voice \(a national advocacy group for homeless young people\) and Homeless Link \(a national charity for organisations working directly with people who become homeless in England\) to develop a simplified ‘Mental Skills Training Toolkit’ based on MST4Life™. The toolkit has been shared with 40 UK organisations who collectively support over 60,000 young people across the UK \[S1\]. The training programme is also included in resources for professionals created by the Association for Young People’s Health \[S2\] and the Young People’s Health Partnership \[S3\] to address health and social inequalities in vulnerable young people. 

 MST4Life™ and the Mental Skills Training Toolkit allow the gap to be narrowed between participants and their ‘housed’ peers. MST4Life™ has been shown to improve **social welfare and equality** by significantly increasing the resilience, educational inclusion and self\-worth of individuals \[S4\]. These benefits are hugely significant given that although 10.5% of the UK’s population is 16–24 years, this age group makes up 21% of the UK’s homeless population. As a group, they face disparate long\-term physical and mental health inequalities, including a low age of death \(47 years for male; 43 years for women\). 

 Independent evaluation has highlighted that MST4Life™ can **secure poverty alleviation** by increasing the likelihood that homeless young people transition into education, employment or training and subsequently exit homelessness by 30 percentage points \[S5\]. In Birmingham, intensive use of the programme by St Basils has **contributed to the 37% reduction in Birmingham’s statutory youth homelessness** in the period of 2013–2014 to 2017–2018 during a time when the national average *increased* by 34% \[S6\]. Improving these outcomes provides **public sector savings** from forgone tax revenues, unemployment benefits and healthcare costs leading to an estimated lifetime savings of £26m for 1,040 young people who exited homelessness in the first three years of project \[S5\]. 

 <ins>Improving the mental health of young people</ins> 

 The impact of MST4Life™ on individuals is best exemplified by testimony. As one MST4Life™ participant stated: 

 \[MST4Life™\] really helped me because with my mental health, I fail to speak out when I’m feeling low and the other day, I had a bit of a rough patch and I knew who to call, because it was, ‘ah I’ve done this, I know who I need when I’m in a crisis, so why am I not doing it?’ And it inspired me to just make that call and it saved a meltdown. \[S7\] 

 These mental health benefits can also be translated more broadly. The research underpinning MST4Life™ has been embedded into two apps to **improve health and well\-being** in different settings: 

1.  KF2 contributed to an emotional workout fitness app ‘Fika’ to help higher education students to train their mental skills and improve well\-being. The app is available to the UK’s population of 2,380,000 higher education students and has been adopted by over 55 organisations and institutions. It has been found to reduce mental health decline and improve well\-being and educational attainment in students \[S8\]. 

1.  The Covid\-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on young people’s mental health and has contributed to high rates of homeless youth \(there has been an estimated increase of 36%–47% between 2019 and 2020\). In response, we translated KF1 and KF2 to provide the evidence base for ‘matchFit’, an app co\-created in partnership with the Street Soccer Foundation, Crisis and Shelter charities. The freely available resource is being used by homeless youth across the country who have faced loneliness, isolation and other difficulties accessing services during lockdown restrictions \[S9\]. 

 <ins>The work of a charitable organisation has been transformed by</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>research</ins> 

 The success MST4Life™ has been confirmed by its inclusion into St Basils core offer, helping to provide **better access to finance opportunities**. It has enabled St Basils to win new contracts and grants in excess of £7m to assist with their work, despite this being a time of constrained funding from traditional sources for housing services \[S10\]. Uses of this funding include: 

-  Appointing new frontline staff, including an in\-house clinical psychologist; 

-  Delivering psychologically informed programmes \(including MST4Life™\) to young people in their service and the staff who support them; 

-  Developing spin\-off projects such as a psychologically informed programme \(related to MST4Life\) for parents of young people as part of upstream prevention of homelessness and winning a contract to deliver in a hospital setting \(e.g. Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust\); 

-  The production of national recommendations \(including MST4Life™\) for a pathway out of the youth justice system as part of homelessness prevention. 

 Overall, MST4Life™ has contributed towards St Basils achieving their: “strategic aim to work with University partners, codify and publish their experiences and practices, and influence policy and commissioning at regional and national levels” \[S10\].

","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Lasse Rempe is Professor of Pure Mathematics in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Liverpool. Rempe researches **dynamical systems**, specifically the iteration of transcendental functions. In **\[3.1\]**, with Sebastian van Strien \(Imperial College London\) he established density of hyperbolicity for the famous Arnold family of circle maps. This family is a simple model for phase\-locking in a periodically forced oscillator that has been studied intensively since the 1960s. Density of hyperbolicity is a central question in one\-dimensional dynamics \(compare Smale’s 11th “problem for the next century”\). It states, informally, that through a small perturbation within the given family, any system can be changed into one exhibiting the simplest type of behaviour \(convergence to stable cycles\) – no matter how chaotically the original system behaves. The proof of this result for the Arnold family draws significantly on Rempe's earlier work **\[3.2\]** on the escaping set of transcendental entire functions; that is, the set of points where the iterates converge to infinity. In **\[3.2\]**, Rempe showed that, for a certain class of functions, the behaviour on this set is very rigid \- that is, it does not give rise to non\-trivial perturbations. The same holds for the complex extension of the Arnold family, with the same proof, and this fact plays a crucial role in **\[3.1\]**. This body of research was supported by funding from EPSRC \(EP/E017886/1, EP/E052851/1\) and the Leverhulme Trust \(Philip Leverhulme Prize 2012\), totalling GBP529,847. 

 There are four key reasons why Rempe’s proof in **\[3.1\]** provided fertile ground for developing new creative thinking in his collaboration with composer Emily Howard. Firstly, the result lends itself to expression in simple and general terms \(no matter how chaotic such a system, there is always stability nearby\). Secondly, phase\-locking is a phenomenon relevant to musicians – from the synchronisation of linked metronomes to the elimination of non\-harmonic overtones through the bowing of a violin string. Thirdly, structure in the complex plane – invisible in the formulation of the problem – plays a crucial part in the proof, which is philosophically intriguing. And, finally, the systems in question could be used to design data series as input into and inspiration for the creative process. From these discussions, Howard evolved new artistic practice underpinned by latest results in dynamical systems research. As an evolution of this creative practice, she went on to draw inspiration directly from other areas of excellent research within Liverpool’s Department of Mathematical Sciences. A further example is given below. 

 Anna Pratoussevitch is a Reader in Pure Mathematics, researching **geometry and topology**. To explore pseudo\-Riemannian space forms of constant curvature, Pratoussevitch constructs fundamental domains in the shape of higher\-dimensional polyhedra **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. A central question of low\-dimensional topology has been the classification of 3\-dimensional manifolds. Thurston's approach to this problem, that any 3\-manifold can be constructed from building blocks carrying one of 8 Riemannian geometries, has contributed significantly to our understanding of low\-dimensional manifolds, including the celebrated proof of the Poincaré conjecture by Perelman. Pratoussevitch's work explores the implications of this approach in pseudo\-Riemannian 3\-manifolds by describing how pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature can be constructed from pseudo\-Riemannian polyhedra by gluing together pairs of 2\-dimensional faces. The constructions of building block manifolds from polyhedra in both Riemannian and pseudo\-Riemannian geometry give excellent visual representations of 3\-dimensional objects that cannot be easily visualized in 3D space. Pratoussevitch explored these fundamental ideas of positive and negative curvature in different spaces alongside images of the polyhedra with composer Howard, initiating new creative thinking about shapes and space to inspire new orchestral music.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 This body of pure mathematics research has brought about three principal impacts on creativity, culture and society: 

-  **4.1.** New creative thinking that transformed the practice and career of composer Emily Howard **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. 

-  **4.2.** Seven musical works over five years, with diverse coverage to wide critical acclaim **\[5.1, 5.3\-8\]**. 

-  **4.3.** Dedicated centre for Practice & Research in Science & Music \(PRiSM\) in Manchester that is influencing composer practice nationally **\[5.1, 5.8\-10\]**. 

###  4.1. Dynamical systems research transforms practice of composer 

 Rempe and Liverpool’s Department of Mathematical Sciences hosted freelance composer Emily Howard as Leverhulme Trust Artist in Residence between February and November 2015 **\[5.2\]**. A mathematics graduate herself, Howard’s fluency in mathematical language enabled her not only to absorb general ideas, but also to discuss details and subtleties of contemporary mathematical research. According to Howard, this made for an ‘ *appealing and distinctive*’ partnership **\[5.1\]**. 

 Working with Rempe and Pratoussevitch provided Howard with unique insights into frontier mathematical research, taking her creative ideas beyond classical mathematical principles for the first time **\[5.1\]**. Howard joined Rempe and his group in discussions about their research throughout 2015, with particular focus on Rempe’s work on the Arnold family **\[3.1\]**. The group created two sets of numeric data for Howard, encapsulating key ideas in the result and its proof. These datasets and discussions were pivotal creative input for Howard’s 2015 compositions described below, establishing enduring principles for her entire approach to composition **\[5.1\]**. Howard explains how this opportunity **‘ **transformed my creative practice at the time and has continued to influence my entire creative approach and musical works since’* **\[5.1\]**. 

###  4.2. Audiences, listeners, music venues, publishers, record labels and performing ensembles benefit from new critically\-acclaimed music 

 The body of research **\[3.1\-4\]** influenced seven critically acclaimed musical works of increasing profile **\[5.3\-4\]**. Audiences in the UK, Germany, Canada and the US, BBC audiences and the wider public have benefitted from sold\-out live performances, radio and streaming **\[5.3\-4\]**. Edition Peters, a world\-leading publisher of classical sheet music who only publishes music with ‘ *sufficient commercial benefit*’ **\[5.5a\]**, signed Howard in March 2019 **\[5.5b\]**. Accompanying programme notes detail how the music is a response to Liverpool’s research **\[5.5c\]**. 

 *Torus* \(2016\) is the first of three geometry\-inspired orchestral works drawing on Howard’s engagement with mathematics research. *Torus* was a **BBC Proms** co\-commission with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, first performed in 2016 at the iconic **Royal Albert Hall** **\[5.3a\]** to a sell\-out audience of 4,294 **\[5.3b\]**. Hailed by **The Guardian** as *‘one of this year’s finest new works’* **\[5.6a\]** and ‘ *visionary*’ by **The Times** **\[5.6b\]**, the piece was recognised with a 2017 **British Composer Award* **\[5.6c\]**, the highest industry recognition for excellence in classical composition. *Torus* was described by the judges as ‘ *captivating from start to finish*’ **\[5.6c\]**. 

 The **Barbican Centre, London**, Europe’s largest performing arts centre, where a live performance of *Torus* by the BBC Symphony Orchestra took place in 2019, describe the piece as ‘ *startling*’ **\[5.3c, 5.8\]**. *Torus* has featured twice on BBC Radio 3 **\[5.3d,e\]**, most recently in 2019 to approximately 333,000 listeners **\[5.3f\]**. Howard deliberately included in *Torus* a ‘ *crucial “perturbation”: a moment where, as in your* \[Rempe’s\] *work, the parameters of the system change slightly to dramatic effect’* **\[5.1\]**. *sphere* \(2017\) was commissioned by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, Germany and broadcast on **BBC Radio 3** **\[5.3g\]** to approximately 310,000 listeners **\[5.3f\]**. Howard explains how ‘ *Several conceptual ideas from dynamical systems* \[Rempe\] *as well as ideas from topology and geometry* \[Pratoussevitch\] *stemming from conversations with researchers at Liverpool have noticeably influenced the work’* **\[5.2\]**. 

 *Antisphere* was commissioned by the Barbican with internationally renowned conductor **Sir Simon Rattle** to open the **London Symphony Orchestra’s** 2019/20 season **\[5.3h, 5.8\]** to a live audience of 1,419 people **\[5.3i\]**. The Barbican’s Classical Programming Coordinator describes this ‘ *dynamic contribution*’ to the Barbican’s 2019/20 programme \- **‘ **bringing to life** **the close connections between the arts and sciences in a truly engaging way**’** and bringing about ‘ *widespread media coverage in national outlets, including interviews on BBC Radio 4*’ **\[5.8\]**. By this time, Howard was credited by Sir Simon Rattle as a *‘gifted composer’*, with her music always having ‘ *a scientific picture behind it*’ and her ‘ *own very particular sound world*’ **\[5.7\]**. 

 Other pieces influenced directly by Rempe’s research include *Leviathan* \(2015\), creating ‘ *a newly‐formed and unpredictable musical language, which responds to recent mathematical research in dynamical systems’* **\[5.5c\]**. Howard explains why this research was important: ‘ *The contrast of chaos in a…system and the stability of neighbouring systems was of particular interest to me, and the connection to physical systems – in particular phase\-locking – and its relevance to musical instruments*’ **\[5.1\]**. *Leviathan* was performed in 2015 in Montreal, Toronto, Detroit, Chicago and New York **\[5.5c\]** as well as six venues in the UK. 

 Howard’s song *Threnos* \(2015\) was broadcast by **BBC Singers** in November 2019 **\[5.3j\]** to approximately 227,000 radio listeners **\[5.3f\]**. *Threnos* and *Leviathan* were recorded for the **NMC Recordings Label** and commercially released in 2016 on Howard’s NMC Disc *Magnetite* **\[5.4\]**, which received four stars from **The Guardian** \[5.6d\]**. The album liner explains how dynamical systems \(specifically the chaotic motion of a forced oscillator\) directly informed the time structure of the work **\[5.4d\]**. At November 2020 it had been streamed 32,950 times, more than ten times that of an equivalent collection released that year **\[5.4e\]**. 

 *Orbit 1a and Orbit 2a* \(2015\) are a direct response to the datasets provided by Rempe’s group. Howard explains ‘ *I selected different musical properties to represent unstable and stable periodic orbits and depicted the specific moment of perturbation \(where the underlying rules of the systems change\) as a definite event’* **\[5.1\]**. Continuing the Orbits series, *Chaos or Chess* \(2016\) is influenced in a *‘more abstract conceptual way by your* \[Rempe’s\] *proof and our stimulating discussions*’, as for *Threnos* **\[5.1\]**. *Orbit 1a* and *Chaos or Chess* were performed live on **BBC Radio 3** in 2016 **\[5.3k\]** and the latter at the Edinburgh Science Festival in 2019 **\[5.3l\]**. 

###  4.3. New dedicated centre for science and music \(PRiSM\) influences other composers 

 Engaging with Liverpool’s research **\[3.1\-4\]** transformed Howard’s approach to composition, shifting the foundations of her entire creative practice, career and outputs: ‘ *Since we* \[Howard and Rempe\] *pioneered this approach, I actively seek out other mathematicians and scientists as rich sources of creative input, made possible through the mathematical confidence I developed during the Liverpool residency… **Through the vehicle of PRiSM** \[centre for Practice & Research in Science & Music\] **we are influencing other composers to change creative practice at national scale \- bringing together a unique community of practitioners and researchers.** *This propagation is evidence of the success and sustainability of the creative approach we pioneered together in Liverpool*’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 In 2017 Howard co\-established PRiSM at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, of which Rempe is a founding Associate member **\[5.1, 5.9a\]**. **Marcus du Sautoy** \(Co\-Director of PRiSM and Simonyi Professor, University of Oxford\) asserts Rempe’s ‘ *pioneering collaboration with Emily was instrumental to the inception of PRiSM*’ **\[5.10\]**. 

 PRiSM is building on the approach developed at Liverpool to benefit composers, curators and audiences through high\-profile commissions. Artificial Intelligence \(AI\)\-generated music in association with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra **\[5.9b\]** is one example. This featured on the **Royal Institution Christmas Lectures** **2019* **\[5.9c\]**, broadcast on BBC 4 and available afterwards on BBC iPlayer, attracting 559,813 views \(03\-03\-2020\) **\[5.9d\]**. Another composer explains how a PRiSM collaboration in 2020 changed her practice: ‘ *I had never before used a scientific paper as a starting point for creating music, and now I am looking at using many different types of text to inform my work as an opera composer*’ **\[5.9e\]**. The **Barbican Centre** evaluates a PRiSM event in 2019: a ‘ *ground\-breaking team of composers from PRiSM*… *leading to new insights*’, enabling the venue to *‘reach an audience outside of our usual classical attenders’,* bringing *‘almost double the expected audience numbers*’; it ‘ *worked so well …we are also looking for further opportunities to involve guest curators in our work*’; benefits to performers include ‘ *using new technologies… which they intend to use more in their day\-to\-day work*’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 *‘ **With the world around us changing, I believe the Barbican’s vision of ‘Arts without Boundaries’ is more vital than ever and that Emily Howard and PRiSM’s innovative works are advancing our progress in realising this vision**’* **\[5.8\]** – The Barbican Centre.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Inefficient heating in large non\-domestic buildings \(e.g. high\-rise office space and shopping centres\) is a major contributor to carbon emissions and climate change. LSBU research has helped to improve the usefulness and efficiency of Building Energy Management Systems \(BEMS, i.e. the main control systems of large building heating and cooling\) by using artificial intelligence to quantify real faults and pivotally explain faults detected by BEMS. This has improved Demand Logic’s Ltd products \(an SME that produces buildings’ BEMS platforms to optimise energy savings\). Demand Logic’s clients are benefiting from a reduction in energy costs of up to 30% and saving GBP6,900,000 \(£6.9 million\) annually. This improved energy efficiency has a beneficial impact on the environment by eliminating 37,000t of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions each year. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 *Background context.* 

 The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) has identified significant barriers to achieve substantial energy savings in the non\-domestic building sector \(e.g. large scale office blocks\), including the cost of capital investment in energy management, lack of know\-how in identifying energy inefficiencies and implementing interventions. 

 LSBU research used artificial intelligence \(AI\) to remove some of these barriers, demonstrating that improving the capability and usefulness of Building Energy Management Systems \(BEMS, i.e. the main control system of non\-domestic building performance data on heating and cooling\) resulted in a step\-change in energy efficiency. This approach provides inexpensive solutions to remote fault finding, leading to enhanced control of BEMS, hence vastly improving large building energy performance and reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 

 *Description of insight* 

 The greatest cause of poor building performance is the malfunctioning of heating, ventilation and air conditioning \(HVAC\) systems. These systems are responsible for floor space heating and cooling and are controlled by the building’s BEMS. Therefore, inefficiencies in these systems directly increase energy waste and impacts comfort. The device used to control the temperature of a particular area is known as a Terminal Unit \(TU\). It regulates the volume of conditioned primary air directed into the space from the central air handler \(i.e. the central HVAC system\). There can be hundreds or even thousands of TUs in a building, depending on its size. 

 Demand Logic Ltd. \(DL\) noted that current BEMS fault\-finding is manual and crude. For this reason, DL contacted Professors Dudley and Ford to search for alternative methods to improve fault detection. Professor Dudley proposed an automated approach to: \(a\) enhance the detection of faulty TUs to improve BEMS usefulness and performance and reduce energy wastage; while, \(b\) breaking down the barriers to achieving substantial energy savings highlighted by BEIS. 

 Initial research by Dudley, Ghavami and Ford focused on improving domestic energy savings through AI **\[R1\]**. In particular, via data disaggregation and AI, energy wastage behaviours were automatically discovered without the need of end\-user input. Two immediate gains that were feedback to end users were: a\) recognition of inefficient set–up of home thermostats; and b\) over estimation of timings required to heat hot\-water tanks. Capitalising on these findings, they investigated AI approaches for to improve BEMS in non\-domestic environments **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 BEMS’ limitations, particularly in the monitoring and detection of TU inefficiencies, have been overlooked by researchers because of the vast number of these TUs in large buildings and their perceived complexity **\[R2\]**. LSBU and DL recognised that substantial energy wastage reductions could be made by investigating BEMS systems and their relationship with TU behaviour **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 *Details of insight* 

 Integrating DL’s knowledge of large building monitoring with LSBU’s experience in applied algorithm development \(Dudley\) and building management \(Ford\) led to a unique RADAR Graphical interface for BEMS fault detection **\[R2\]**. This AI\-driven system pre\-processes, clusters and classifies TUs into well and badly behaved elements, displaying results \(the TU and its fault\) in a user\-friendly manner **\[R2\]**. Problems that were originally difficult to identify and characterise were thus automatically classified by the new technology as: 

 a\) hunting \(i.e. competing heating/cooling sources trying to achieve a set temperature in a single area\), thus the system can never settle **\[R2\];** 

 b\) overpowering/saturation \(i.e. using too much power\) **\[R2\];** 

 c\) on\-ness \(i.e. TUs being always on\) **\[R2\];** and 

 d\) set\-point deviation \(i.e. failure to achieve the comfort target\) **\[R2\].** 

 A key finding was that 99% of all faults detected fell into a\) to d\) **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 Finally, a positive unintended consequence of the above approach was detecting non\-faults wrongly classified as faults by BEMS **\[R3\]**. For instance, a building design fault: e.g. a TU accidentally not connected to its temperature sensor by a retrofitted partition wall, makes the TU persist \(as it should\), without success, to bring the room temperature to the desired level. These “false rogue” TUs are difficult to manually detect but were quickly automatically identified and rectified.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Inefficient heating in large buildings is a major contributor to carbon emissions and climate change. Throughout the UK and Europe almost 20% of the electrical energy we use in manufacturing and commercial operation is consumed by the HVAC systems. Heating makes up 40% of a business energy costs on average, according to the Carbon Trust. The LSBU research presented above has improved the performance of BEMS by using AI methods to improve detection of faulty Terminal Units \(TUs\), dramatically reducing energy wastage. This had a direct impact on the quality of Demand Logic’s \(DL\) products since 2015 and added value through the application of research methods to their commercial activities **\[S1\]**. This in turn benefited DL’s UK and EU clients by helping them reduce energy waste \(environmental Impact\) and energy expenditure \(economic impacts\). 

 Demand Logic’s CEO confirms the impact and value of LSBU’s research input: “ *The research conducted at LSBU enabled BEMS data of any type to be pre\-processed automatically and to be made easily available via a RADAR chart \(an easy to read visual chart that classifies and displays the good and misbehaving terminal units in a building\) to determine which are the terminal units who are operating as designed, and which are causing energy and comfort problems, and pivotally why they seem to be misbehaving. The set\-up is now more intuitive and the complex parts of installations have been automated or eliminated. This research is certainly valuable to our customers.*” **\[S1\]** 

 Using AI to enhance the value derived from BEMS data has helped DL to: 

-  support and streamline the commissioning process, validating that equipment has been correctly installed and configured through automatic fault detection; 

-  provide a user\-friendly graphical interface overlaying the BEMS for building teams, making data immediately accessible in a familiar format. This included a table view providing an overview of many devices and problem classification; 

-  empower building management teams to rapidly identify malfunctioning equipment, saving both time and money on maintenance as well as extending plant lifespans. This was particularly useful for equipment in difficult to access areas; and 

-  improve comfort levels for building users, proactively managing temperatures, lighting and air quality, e.g. reducing likely hot and cold spots. 

 The main beneficiaries of the improved DL products are their clients. DL report **\[S2\]** that their clients save GPB6,900,000 \(£6.9m\) in energy costs annually and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 37,000t. Specific examples are given below. 

 *The Better Buildings Partnership \(BBP\)* is a collaboration of leading commercial property owners who aim improve the sustainability of existing commercial building stock. Six of their members \(Canary Wharf Group, Land Securities, M&G Real Estate, TH Real Estate, The Crown Estate and Transport for London\) have revealed specific benefits arising from installing DL’s system. 

 The economic impacts include **\[S3, S4, S5\]**: 

-  average energy cost savings of 10%\-30%; 

-  average payback on investment within nine months; and 

-  GBP1,800,000 \(£1.8m\) energy cost savings annually 

 The main environmental impact for the six BBP members listed above **\[S2\- S4\]** was the annual saving of 11,800t of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. **\[S3\]**. 

 *Standard Chartered Bank HQ* **\[S6\]** 

 The headquarters of Standard Chartered Bank in London contains 200,000 ft² \(18,581 m²\) of office floor space. In order to reduce its carbon emissions, as well as to reduce costs \(energy spend was GBP610,000 \(£610k\) at the time\), Demand Logic was installed in May 2017. The remote detection and improvements enabled problem solving without direct user interaction. By December 2017 significant improvements were already evident: 

-  a reduction of 10% \(GBP61,000 \(£61k\)\) on energy spend; 

-  chillers were running to a proper demand schedule. One engineer with six years’ experience on the site had never seen this; “hunting” behaviour had meant that the chillers were always on; 

-  the Demand Logic system discovered several faulty Fan Coil Units \(FCUs\) that the BMS said were working fine; and 

-  users experienced a more comfortable environment, with a 59% reduction in the number of spaces which were judged too warm \(>25<sup>o</sup>C\). 

 *20 Fenchurch Street \(Landsec\)* **\[S7\]** 

 Landsec Group plc, the largest commercial property development and investment company in the UK, owns and manages 335,000m<sup>2</sup> of buildings. 

 One of their most familiar commercial sites is 20 Fenchurch Street, London \(known colloquially as the “Walkie\-Talkie”\). This environment in this 34\-storey tower is controlled by 1,200 air conditioning units, with over 175,000 data points and generating 17,000,000 data values on building performance every day **\[S5\]**. HVAC systems account for approximately two\-thirds of 20 Fenchurch Street’s energy consumption. Day\-to\-day management of the building’s performance is split between the landlord and tenant’s engineering teams. This is common for multi\-tenanted buildings and often presents a challenge for reducing operational energy consumption. The Landsec team now uses Demand Logic data visualisation to engage with the tenant, Allied World; consequently, Allied World agreed to re\-set the temperature set\-points and to widen the temperature range. The tenant was able to make these changes themselves and the impact was immediate, as monitored by Demand Logic. Analysis revealed a 27% reduction in demand of both heating and cooling as well as a 62% reduction in heating power **\[S7\]**. 

 The approach also allowed for a change in operating procedure by the facilities management team. The usual mode is reactive maintenance, responding to tenants’ complaints and concerns. The use of Demand Logic’s AI\-driven interface enabled by LSBU research allowed a proactive way of working, using data to identify individual components which are misbehaving. It is effective in reducing energy consumption, focusing engineering time and reducing the number of complaint calls requiring reactive maintenance **\[S7\]**. 

 The number of deployed installations by Demand Logic improved by LSBU’s research contribution has grown substantially over time **\[S4\]**. The platform is currently in use at sites covering 118 buildings totalling 1,400,000m<sup>2</sup> of real estate. The Financial Times headquarters in London has reported that comfort complaints have halved since the platform was installed. 

 Finally, DL technology enhanced by LSBU research has been mentioned in a debate in Parliament **\[S7\]** \(Bill 267 – Energy Consumption \(Innovative Technologies\) where it is reported that “ *Demand Logic technology could help to cut costs for businesses and public authorities in that respect. It provides data intelligence on how a building operates, and can ensure that maintenance work is prioritised to where it is most effective. Better comfort levels should encourage us to be more productive in our work, so it is a win\-win all round*.”

 Bowel cancer screening is estimated to save around 2,400 lives per year and reduces NHS costs. Sheffield research evaluated different options for the bowel cancer screening programme including the optimal design for repeated Faecal Immunochemical Test \(FIT\) screening. This research directly informed the 2016 UK National Screening Committee recommendation to replace the guaiac occult blood test \(gFOBt\) with the FIT. UK roll\-out of FIT screening began in 2017. Moving to FIT results in higher participation \(59% to 66%\) and higher levels of detection. Projections suggest that moving from gFOBt to FIT enables a lifetime reduction of cancer related mortality of 8%. The overall net monetary benefit is estimated as £107.3m.

The School of Health and Related Research \(ScHARR\) at the University of Sheffield has been working with the Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\), Public Health England and UK National Screening Committee \(NSC\) since 2004 to support evidence\-based policy making in bowel cancer screening. 

 Bowel cancer screening is a complex intervention with multiple components. Sheffield research focuses upon the development of mathematical models of the bowel cancer screening system, including disease natural history, diagnosis, treatment and surveillance, and the application of these models to inform policy decisions. Between 2010\-2012 ScHARR undertook a reappraisal of bowel cancer screening options on behalf of NHS Cancer Screening Programmes. This involved collaboration to incorporate data from clinical trials and routine screening data. Model results suggested that screening strategies involving Flexible Sigmoidoscopy \(FS\) or FIT may produce additional benefits compared with the existing biennial guaiac occult blood testing \(gFOBT\) screening strategy as they are both more sensitive tests. The age at which a single FS screen results in the greatest quality\-adjusted life year gain was 55. Strategies which combined FS and FIT showed further benefits and improved economic outcomes. These results were not obtainable from trials alone and required our modelling \[R1, R2\]. 

 FS screening for 55\-year\-olds \(in addition to repeated gFOBT\) was introduced in 2013 under the name ‘bowel scope screening’. Due to capacity constraints bowel scope screening is not yet available in all areas of the UK. Uptake was low at 43% and there were some differences in detection rates compared to the trial setting. 

 In 2016 Sheffield researchers were funded by the UK NSC to undertake further research drawing on data from the bowel scope screening programme. The first research phase considered the cost\-effectiveness and endoscopy capacity requirements of a variety of different screening options incorporating FIT \[R3\], based on modelling using ScHARR’s validated model \[R4\]. The second phase of the research developed a new version of the model which uses a patient level simulation approach to enable evaluation of the impact of screening on health inequalities and the evaluation of targeted and personalised screening strategies. 

 Our analysis showed that FIT is a cost\-effective test to use in the bowel screening programme. The ideal age to start is at 50/51 years, recommended screening interval was two years and the FIT threshold should be 20 µg/g \(or as low as possible with available colonoscopy capacity\) \[R3\]. 

 The key constraint limiting further optimisation of the UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme \(BCSP\) is NHS colonoscopy capacity, with screening referrals to colonoscopy competing with cancer investigations and surveillance in the symptomatic and previously treated populations. In light of this constraint, the British Society of Gastroenterology \(BSG\) commissioned a review of surveillance guidelines, resulting in the 2018/19 guidelines for surveillance post\-polypectomy/colorectal resection from the BSG, the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland \(ACPGBI\) and Public Health England \(PHE\). A systematic review was undertaken by ScHARR to support this Guideline development and found that patients with low risk adenomas are not at increased risk of bowel cancer compared to patients with no adenomas detected at colonoscopy. Dr Whyte acted as a Member of the BSG guideline development group playing a key role as the only health economist in the group \[R5\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sheffield research provided key evidence to inform national policy recommendations and implementation of bowel cancer screening in the UK. Refining and optimising bowel cancer screening programmes from gFOBT to FIT enables the NHS to save costs, reduce cancer morbidity, save lives and in some cases prevent potential harm associated with screening. 

 Change in policy and practice 

 Our work on optimising the design of the FIT based screening programme directly informed the recommendations of the UK NSC. In January 2016, the UK NSC recommended a change to the primary test used in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme from gFOBt to FIT \[S1\]. In August 2018, following further review of the evidence, the UK NSC recommended that FIT is offered at 50\-74 years at as low a threshold as possible \[S1\]. Sheffield research is directly cited in the evidence used to inform these recommendations \[S1\]. 

 The introduction of FIT into the screening programme provides further opportunity to detect and prevent more cancers. The benefits of using FIT are that: 

-  it is easier to use and can be measured more reliably using a machine rather than the human eye; 

-  the increased sensitivity enables FIT to detect more pre\-cancer lesions; 

-  FIT requires a single faecal sample and is more acceptable to people invited to screening; 

-  FIT is a cost\-effective alternative to gFOBt \[S1\]. 

 Following the recommendations of the UK NSC, FIT was rolled out across the UK \[S2\]: 

-  In Scotland, FIT replaced gFOBt as the test for bowel screening in November 2017 \(ages 50\-74, threshold 80 μgHb/g faeces\). 

-  In England, FIT was introduced in June 2019 \(ages 60\-74, threshold 120 μgHb/g faeces\). 

-  In Wales FIT started to replace gFOBt through a phased roll out, with 1 in 28 people receiving the new kit from the end of January 2019, \(ages 60\-74, threshold 150 μgHb/g faeces\). 

-  In Northern Ireland, the Department of Health announced on 11 April 2019 to roll out FIT from early 2020, \(ages 60\-74\). 

 Improving patient health outcomes and cost savings to the NHS 

 The ‘Report of the Independent Review of Adult National Screening Programmes in England’ \(October 2019\) for NHS England indicates that bowel cancer screening is estimated to save around 2,400 lives per year. In 2017/18, 4.4m people were invited for screening with 2.5m people screened. This represents an increase in bowel cancer screening since 2016/17 \[S3\]. 



 *Source: \[S3\] Report of the Independent Review of Adult National Screening Programmes in England, p.65* 

 Data from the first 12 months of FIT screening in Scotland showed an increase in uptake from 55.4% for gFOBT up to 63.9% for FIT. In Scotland the biggest improvement in participation with FIT has been amongst those living in the most deprived areas – up from 42.0% to 51.8% \[S4\]. FIT has the potential to reduce health inequalities due to higher uptake in more deprived subgroups. 

 Data from the first 6 months after FIT screening began in England, indicates that between 1 July 2019\-30 September 2019 that the proportion of men and women aged 60\-74 invited to participate in bowel cancer screening that adequately participate is 67.5% and between 1 Oct 2019\-31 December 2019 this is 64.5% \[S5\]. Uptake from the first 6 months is in line with earlier predictions made in the modelling. 

 The impact on patient outcomes cannot be fully demonstrated in a short timeframe as screening that results in the prompt removal of precancerous conditions may prevent the future CRC \(colorectal cancer\) incidence and mortality. However, our model predictions for England show that the move from gFOBT to FIT \(with 40% also offered Bowel Scope screening\) is predicted to be associated with a net monetary benefit of £107.3m; quality adjusted life year gains, 4,006; lifetime reduction in bowel cancer 8%; lifetime reduction in CRC mortality, 8%; reduction in late stage incidence, 8% \[S6\] 

 Surveillance of persons following screening colonoscopy 

 The British Society of Gastroenterology \(BSG\) adenoma surveillance guidelines were updated in November 2019 and are NICE compliant. The new guidelines recommend a reduction in surveillance for persons who are at a low risk of CRC. These new guidelines will reduce unnecessary colonoscopies and harm, save NHS money, and free up endoscopy capacity to be better used elsewhere. It is possible that by reducing the endoscopy requirements for adenoma surveillance and symptomatic referrals could enable expansion of the FIT screening programme. 

 While it is still early to assess the direct effects of the new guidelines, modelling undertaken by St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust provide an estimate of the potential cost savings and capacity that could be generated, *“Implementing the 2019 guideline will lead to an annual cost saving of £75,159 to £87,699, depending on the number of patients <45 years old offered colonoscopy surveillance, and generate capacity for 177 to 207 additional colonoscopies per year”* \[S7\]. 

 Informing international policy and practice 

 Sheffield research is included in the International Handbook of Cancer Prevention by the International Agency for Research on Cancer \(IARC\) of the World Health Organisation, 2019. The IARC Handbooks evaluate the published scientific evidence of cancer\-preventive interventions and provide authoritative information about cancer research \[S8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Sepsis is one of the most common but least treatable causes of death in hospitals worldwide. Part of this situation stemmed from the lack of an agreed international definition of sepsis and septic shock, which would allow robust diagnosis and patient management. King’s has led on the redefinition of sepsis, initiated the UK’s first epidemiological study on long\-term outcomes, and characterised the associated immune response. This work led to a new internationally adopted clinical definition \(within the ICD\-11 classification\), championed by the WHO to recognise sepsis as a global health priority. It has informed healthcare policies and clinical management of sepsis patients and survivors globally. Most recently, King’s expertise has been applied to support the UK’s clinical response to COVID\-19. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Sepsis is a severe response of the human immune system to bacterial and viral infections.** We commonly consider bacterial infection when thinking about sepsis, but severe COVID\-19 is a typical example of viral sepsis. In the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases report, there were nearly **50 million cases of sepsis and 11 million resultant deaths worldwide** \(85% of which occured in low\- or middle\-income countries\). The fundamental challenge to clinicians is how to diagnose and treat this condition. This impact case focuses on work addressing three related clinical problems, based on the premise that robustly defining \(‘benchmarking’\) the diagnosis of sepsis and its clinical management is a highly effective way to improve patient survival. This was previously lacking because: \(i\) there was no universally accepted clinical definition of sepsis; \(ii\) there were no agreed clinical diagnostic measures of sepsis; \(iii\) there were no drugs of proven value to treat the immune response to sepsis. **Consequently, this made sepsis one of the most common but least treatable causes of death in hospitals.** 

 **Before 2016 diagnosis of sepsis was inconsistent globally.** There was no international agreement on clinical diagnosis of sepsis based on patient examination, as symptoms differ between patients, leaving diagnosis up to individual clinician’s judgement. Without a definition, it was impossible to standardise the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) International Classification of Disease \(ICD\) coding of sepsis in hospitals to allow international benchmarking, comparison of global incidence and treatment, and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes. Consequently, there was also no national data from England on what happens to sepsis survivors once discharged from hospital, and how the longer\-term prognosis for sepsis survivors compares to other high\-income countries. King’s researchers and others internationally recognised the need to re\-define sepsis and septic shock \(referred to as Sepsis\-3 definitions hereon\). 

 **In 2016, King’s work re\-defined sepsis as ‘life\-threatening organ dysfunction due to the body’s response to infection’.** Kings researcher Shankar\-Hari led the redefinition of Septic Shock as part of a 16\-member international expert panel \(Task Force\) – convened by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the \(US\) Society of Critical Care Medicine – and for the first time, generated explicit clinical criteria for septic shock diagnosis **\(1, 2\).** Shankar\-Hari went on to help write the Task Force Sepsis Definitions document, for use by clinicians globally. This work used an innovative mix of scientific methods to systematically analyse global epidemiological and clinical records to arrive at the new definition and clinical criteria. A combination of analysis of systematic reviews, a Delphi process to generate expert consensus, and data analyses of nearly 4.5 million sepsis incidents worldwide – none of which had previously been applied to septic shock – gave powerful and robust results **\(1, 2\)**. 

 **Kings researchers used this new definition to analyse patterns in sepsis survival in England. They led the first UK epidemiological study** to examine the long\-term outcome for sepsis survivors. Using data from the  [ICNARC](https://www.icnarc.org/) database on nearly 700,000 critical care admissions \(between 2009 and 2014\) in England, King’s identified 94,748 sepsis survivors. They showed that amongst this group, when followed up over a 5\-year period, 15% of sepsis survivors die in the first year following hospital discharge, with 6\-8% dying yearly over the next 5 years. Furthermore, nearly a third of these sepsis survivors are hospitalised again within 90\-days of being discharged **\(3\).** These results led the researchers to design and clinically validate a sepsis survivor score, which estimates prognosis for the first year based on follow\-up care **\(4\).** 

 **Identifying diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of the immune response associated with sepsis.** While there are known differences between the signatures of the immune response to sepsis and to non\-infectious severe conditions such as major trauma, there was previously no consensus on which measurable indicators of clinical illness \(referred to as biomarkers\) are useful as diagnostic tests for sepsis. King’s researchers recognised the need for biomarkers that reliably differentiate which patients with infection will go on to develop sepsis, and also to identify which of these biomarkers are specific for sepsis to differentiate it from other inflammatory conditions. To do this first required a standardised assessment of the immune system across many patients and so in 2018, King’s led the first UK study to profile immune cells in this cohort, using flow\-cytometry. King’s identified three potential biomarkers that could predict which of those patients requiring emergency care and with an infection, would go on to develop sepsis \(5\). Importantly, it also laid foundations for large scale immunological profiling for the assessment of sepsis and, more recently, COVID\-19 at King’s. 

 **Synthesising evidence for clinical practice on the use of corticosteroids to treat the immune response to sepsis.** There were no drugs proven to favourably change the severe immune responses in sepsis to benefit patients. Corticosteroids are cheap, globally available, and early evidence suggested they were a potential treatment; however, the largest RCTs had given mixed outcomes, so there was an urgent need to assess all evidence systematically in order to make clinical recommendations. Based on his expertise in clinical sepsis research, Shankar\-Hari was recruited to an international expert panel; having commissioned a systematic review of latest evidence, the panel co\-authored a BMJ rapid recommendation clinical practice guideline on corticosteroid therapy for adult sepsis patients. It recommended that corticosteroid therapy in sepsis may reduce duration of septic shock \(6\). 

 **Responding rapidly to assess the immune response of COVID\-19.** When the pandemic arrived in the UK, King’s researchers worked closely with emergency care and infection diseases clinicians at Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust \(GSTT\) to assess the immune system changes associated with COVID\-19 infection using their earlier sepsis studies as the foundation \(COVID\-IP, a collaboration between King’s, GSTT and The Francis Crick Institute led by Prof Hayday\). This provided the largest \(at that time\) comprehensive assessment of immune biomarkers of severe COVID\-19 \(based on 63 adult patients admitted to GSTT\), identifying those biomarkers associated with poor prognosis, those that are similar to sepsis, and those that help predict the immune response \(7\). Kings were also the first to report immunological changes observed in the rare COVID\-related illness, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children \(MIS\-C\), revealing it was a serious immunopathological condition distinct from Kawasaki’s disease despite superficial resemblance \(8\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Following the publication of the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock \(Sepsis\-3\) in 2016 \(1, 2\), the major elements of international classification, policy and clinical guidance for sepsis which affect clinical care worldwide, have been changed. This has impacted national and international levels of healthcare policy and clinical management of sepsis. 

#  <ins> *Impact on international health policy and clinical management of sepsis*</ins> 

 **The revised sepsis definitions were adopted as the new International Classification of Diseases standard \(ICD\-11\) \[A\].** The ICD coding system is used for classifying all diseases globally, overseen by the WHO, who describe the ICD as ‘the foundation for the identification of health trends and statistics globally, and the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is the diagnostic classification standard for all clinical and research purposes.’ In May 2019, the WHO’s World Health Assembly officially adopted ICD\-11, directly drawn from King’s research \(1,2\). The ICD is used to underpin comparisons of health data \(local, regional, national, international\), in analysis that informs evidence\-based decision making and policy development, and to monitor the incidence, prevalence and causes of disease. The ICD is also used to determine the Global Burden of Disease estimates of sepsis \(a tool widely used by policymakers\). WHO regulations ensure Member States use the most current ICD revision to record and report mortality and morbidity statistics, nationally and internationally: since the previous 1990 endorsed version, the system has been used by more than 150 countries and translated in over 40 languages. 

 **The new definitions both support and help deliver on the WHO commitment to make sepsis a global health priority \[B\].** In 2017, the WHO highlighted the updated sepsis definitions as the diagnostic gold standard and recognised sepsis as a global health priority \- a year after publication of pivotal research led by King’s researchers. Later that year the WHO Assembly adopted resolution WHA70.7 on ‘Improving the prevention, diagnosis and clinical management of sepsis’; this urged member states to ‘apply and improve the use of the International Classification of Diseases system to establish the prevalence and profile of sepsis’ **\[B.2\]**. In 2020, the progress report on this resolution specifically notes that the ‘WHO published the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, allowing reporting of sepsis, in conjunction with the underlying infection’, as a milestone towards estimating the global burden of sepsis more accurately **\[B.3\]**. The WHO factsheet on sepsis also explicitly references King’s research **\(1, 2\) \[B.1\]**. 

 **The new definitions underpin the WHO’s first global epidemiological report on sepsis.** In September 2020, the WHO published its first ‘Global report on the epidemiology and burden of sepsis’. When the report was launched the WHO Director\-General said: *“*The world must urgently step up efforts to improve data about sepsis so all countries can detect and treat this terrible condition in time” **\[C.1\]**. This report enabled for the first time the gathering of global epidemiological data in sepsis incidence and outcome – and it noted that data was still incomplete and patchy, highlighting the need for more action. To address this, the WHO proposed using the ICD\-11 going forwards to standardise diagnosis, treatment and reporting across regions in order to ‘Improve surveillance systems, starting at the primary care level, including the use of standardized and feasible definitions in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases \(ICD\-11\), and leveraging existing programmes and disease networks *’* **\[C.2\]**. 

 **Impact of new ICD\-11 definition for healthcare systems and professionals.** The establishment of the ICD\-11 definition of sepsis benefits national organisations that influence health policy to improve patient care. These definitions were **endorsed by the UK’s Academy of Medical Royal Colleges** and 30 equivalent **national or regional societies from all WHO health regions** \(including the USA, Europe, Japan, China, Caribbean, Pan Arabic Critical Care Society, India\) **\[D.1\]**. Following these endorsements, these Professional bodies and patient advocacy groups \(for example the UK Sepsis Trust\) have used the new sepsis definitions to lobby governments for improved management of sepsis patients **\[D.2\]**. These definitions are now used for diagnosing and treating sepsis patients in all these countries such that they have contributed to the quantitation of worldwide sepsis incidence and outcome statistics in the widely used WHO Global Burden of Disease **\[D.3\]**. The new definitions were also adopted by the International Surviving Sepsis Campaign \(SSC\) guidelines in 2016 **\[D.4\]**. The SSC is a global initiative of the Society of Critical Care Medicine \(SCCM\) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine \(ESICM\) at 200 sites internationally, to measure and compare changes in adherence to sepsis quality of care indicators, aiming to reduce mortality and morbidity from sepsis. 

#  <ins> *Impact on Sepsis patient management in the UK*</ins> 

 The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre database  [ICNARC](https://www.icnarc.org/) is the national audit for all 235 UK NHS Trusts \(98% coverage of adult general critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland\), that assesses the outcome and care quality of adult critical care units in the UK every year. Shankar\-Hari is a Senior Clinical Scientist at ICNARC and led the study that is currently used to benchmark sepsis between different intensive care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland **\[E.1\]**. This King’s\-led work described how to operationalise the international benchmarking of sepsis incidence and outcomes **\[E.2\]**. Since 2019, these methods are used for the national patient\-centred safety and quality of care policy, funded by the UK Government \(Getting It Right First Time\) which expects hospitals to adapt their sepsis management procedures in line with the CQUIN report \(NHS Commissioning for Quality and Innovation\) **\[E.3, E.7\]**. This exemplifies a change of the implementation of national level benchmarking of critical care units to improve clinical care of sepsis patients \(data on the effect of implementing this change in the UK is not yet available and will be highly skewed by COVID\-19\). In 2019, Shankar\-Hari also collaborated with NHS Digital to extract all known sepsis events in the UK \(2011\-2017\), in order to generate a measure of sepsis disease burden in the UK used to inform health policy **\[E.4\-E.6\]**. 

#  <ins> **Impact of King’s\-led research on patient care and outcomes of sepsis**</ins> 

 **King’s expertise leads to the development of patient\-centred clinical resources.** The **BMJ rapid practice recommendations** provide guidance for clinicians on how best to treat patients with corticosteroids, based on critical appraisal of all available evidence **\(6\)**. This coproduced research involved sepsis survivors and caregivers as well as healthcare professionals, and explicitly developed recommendations taking into account patient outcomes and patient preferences – for example, giving options which make a distinction between reducing the chance of death and quality of life. The resulting guidelines on corticosteroid therapy for sepsis patients are intended for use by clinicians, explicitly involving patients and carers in the decision\-making process. BMJ guidelines – patient and practice\-changing focused – are widely adopted, influencing patient care internationally **\[F.1\]**. Based on the findings on sepsis survivor care and prognosis **\(4\)**, King’s developed a prognostic tool. This clinically\-validated sepsis survivor score provides estimates of prognosis for the first year post\-sepsis based on follow\-up care, and can be used by clinicians/patients to anticipate risk and manage the follow\-up care of sepsis survivors based on risk, for the first time. This open\-access score has been endorsed by the UK Intensive Care Society for use by UK clinicians **\[F.2\]**. 

 **Raising awareness amongst clinicians, sepsis survivors and the public of health risks.** In the UK, few patients who survive sepsis\-related critical illness are given follow\-up care, and King’s research highlighted that one in six sepsis survivors die in the first subsequent year **\(3,4\)**. To increase public awareness and lobbying to address this at a national level, King’s have engaged extensively with the media on this important patient centred issue, with this specific study being covered by 86 National and International Newspapers and numerous blogs in 2019 **\[G.1\]**. Furthermore, focus groups of clinicians, sepsis survivors and their families revealed much greater awareness of the risk of future morbidity and mortality, and the need for close monitoring   **\[G.2\]**. 

 **Using sepsis expertise to inform the clinical response to COVID\-19.** King’s research on the immunophenotyping of Sepsis and COVID\-19 **\(5,7,8\)** has had several early impacts in 2020, with Professor Shankar\-Hari taking leadership roles in the national response due to his expertise in the field of sepsis. Given his role in identifying long\-term risk factors in sepsis survivors, his expertise was sought as part of the WHO international Long COVID Committee, which was tasked with the clinical characterisation of Long COVID and the ICD11 coding also directly informed WHO COVID information \(2020\) **\[H.1\]**. As a result of the COVID\-IP and MIS\-C studies, Professors Shankar\-Hari and Hayday were invited to give evidence to the House of Lords Science & Technology  Select Committee on the immunology of COVID\-19 in June 2020 \[H.2\]. Furthermore, King’s work led to strategic investment of USD20 million by NIH to understand the pathology of MIS\-C and pilot treatments **\[H.3\]**.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Our body of work has provided robust scientific evidence on the benefits and harms of the digital age for young people. **The original contribution is that** **the findings are, for the first time, grounded in evidence of youth perspectives**. The specific and novel focus was on co\-producing new knowledge with youth to explain what and how they learn in digital health contexts, and, in turn, the offline educative support they require from relevant adults to maximise benefits and mitigate risks. Overall, the research enhances adults’ abilities to make informed decisions about how to protect youth from health\-related risks and maximise the benefits of the digital age. 

 The main empirical research was undertaken between 2015–2019 in collaboration with: \(i\) **young people** \(n=1691; age 13–18; across the UK\) to examine the types of physical activity, diet/nutrition and body image information young people access and use from social media, apps and wearable devices, and why; \(ii\) **practitioners/professionals**, within a network of 35 international researchers, teachers, health and technology professionals, and policy makers to understand how relevant adults can provide support; \(iii\) 2 **national professional development providers** to influence the content and design of teacher and coach professional development. 

 <ins> **Key Findings**</ins> 

 **Young People** 

1.  **The data revealed new evidence on how digital spaces educate young people**: 5 forms of digital content influenced young people’s learning in digital spaces: peer content \(e.g., selfies\); reputable accounts \(e.g., ‘celebrities’, government\); recommended content \(e.g., YouTube\); commercial content and ‘likes’ influenced young people to engage with health information in different ways. \[R1\] 

1.  **In contrast to previous evidence and popular opinion, findings showed that young people are critical and highly self\-aware users and generators of digital mediums**: Most young people could evaluate the types of content that were relevant to their needs and disregard content that had the potential to lead to harm. Young people were highly self\-aware of their own vulnerabilities and recognised that digital engagement can magnify those vulnerabilities, posing additional health\-related risks. The context in which social media is used is important, where peers, family members and schools are powerful influencers. \[R2\] 

 **Practitioners/Professionals** 

1.  **New evidence is provided on what support young people want and need in schools**: Personal, Social and Health Education \(PSHE\) and Physical Education \(PE\) were identified as primary contexts in which to provide media literacy education that helps young people to navigate age\-appropriate content, and in a way that reaches all young people \(from diverse contexts\). \[R3\] 

1.  **Digital Technology Companies/Social Media were identified as essential for offering online support, and this is often lost in discourse about support and risk**: Social media/technology companies provide online education and include filters and restrictions to protect the safety of younger users. \[R4\] 

 **Professional Development Providers** 

1.  **Findings furthered the importance of focusing on inclusion in teacher/coach professional development**: Professional development provision should focus on **inclusive practices** to help teachers and coaches engage with the complexity and diversity of young people’s digital needs. \[R5\] 

1.  **Findings from youth provided new understandings into safeguarding issues**: Safeguarding issues related to young people’s engagement will ensure that young people receive appropriate support from adults. \[R6\]

 <ins>Impacts on</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>ublic</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>olicy has led to the regulation of social media companies in the UK</ins> 

 **Policy decisions and changes to legislation  have been informed by our research evidence which was important in drafting and developing the intermediate bill on online harms in the UK in 2020 \[R4\]. Our contribution to policy development was pivotal as **we** **were the only academics guiding parliamentarians with evidence co\-produced with young people** and on youth perspectives on digital health learning. 

 Evidence provided by Goodyear to the Chief Medical Officer roundtable on screen time and social media use \[R4\] was explicitly reported in the preceding White Paper \(E1, Box 11\). Based on concerns about online safety for young people outlined in E1, the Online Harms Bill called for the appointment of Ofcom as an online regulator for social media. This directly reflects the oral and written evidence \[R4\] provided by Goodyear in the House of Commons to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Social Media and Young People’s Mental Health and Wellbeing \[E3, paras 17,18\]. This led to the recommendation that social media companies establish a duty of care to include new filters and restrictions on content \[E4\]. 

 This is a shift in policy debate and interest by government, and is significant because our research **highlighted to parliamentarians a new issue of concern**. Prior to this intervention, social media were regulated under the broad category of the Internet, and there was no regulator or legislation of the practices of social media companies in the UK related to online harms. The change has national reach where it impacts on 71% of young people in the UK \(approx. 7.3 million age 10–19; Statista, 2018\), who are reported to be active users of social media \(Ofcom, 2019\). 

 <ins>Impacts on</ins> <ins>l</ins><ins>earning by</ins> <ins>p</ins><ins>olicy</ins> <ins>c</ins><ins>hanges to the national school curriculum</ins> 

 In 2020, Personal, Social and Health Education \(PSHE\) was made a mandatory subject in 20,202 UK state schools. Furthermore, the content of the curriculum was changed to include a new focus on age\-appropriate digital content, digital literacy, and online safety education — in relation to health, e.g., body image and social media \(Department for Education \(DfE\) 2019\). 

 Both these **changes to educational policy were directly informed by our research** \[R3\] and follow recommendations made by Goodyear to the Science and Technology Committee \(STC\) in the form of written evidence \[E5, para 21\], and in responses made during oral evidence in the House of Commons \[E6, Q298–300; E4, paras 19, 145, 153\]. Based on this evidence, the STC made the following recommendation: 

 We recommend that PSHE education be made mandatory for primary and secondary school children in the next parliamentary session and that the PSHE curriculum delivers an age\-appropriate understanding of, and resilience towards, the harms and benefits of the digital world. \[E4, para 149\] 

 The APPG also made the recommendation that PSHE should be mandatory and include a focus on health\-related harms and benefits of social media use \[E2, para 5.1\]. This statement echoes the oral evidence provided by Goodyear based on R1 to the House of Commons \[E2, paras 3–5\] and documented in a report from the APPG \[E2, key finding, p. 5\]. Finally, The Youth Select Committee recommended that media literacy for body image should be taught in PSHE \[E7, paras 12, 13\], again drawing on written evidence based on R2 provided by Goodyear and Armour. 

 Informed by the research evidence \[R3\], the **statutory guidelines have changed**, so that they now require that pupils should know about comparisons with others online and how using social media can lead to the development of an unrealistic body image \(DfE, 2019, p. 36\), how relationships on social media develop \(DfE, 2019, p. 36\), why age restrictions exist for content and platforms \(DfE, 2019, p. 32\) and the positive impacts of social media on relationships and health behaviours \(DfE, 2019, p. 36\). In addition, the need for teaching different content related to social media for primary and secondary school pupils was accepted \(DfE, 2019\). These changes reached, at a minimum, the 8 million pupils in state school education \(DfE, 2019\). Pre\-2020, PSHE digital literacy and health education were not statutory requirements \(PSHE Association, 2018\). 

 <ins>Influencing professional standards by informing best practice</ins> 

 **Professional bodies have been influenced by our research and have developed best practices and guidelines** for informing and training teachers and coaches who have a responsibility for young people’s health and wellbeing. 

 As an example, ukactive recently **published national guidelines** on healthy lifestyle behaviours, and our evidence \[R1, R2\] on social media and physical activity education were cited as an example of best practice \[E8\]. The guidelines were sent to 4,000 ukactive member organisations \(i.e., physical activity organisations with a typical minimum membership of 100 individuals\), which has subsequently **impacted on how technology is used pedagogically**. For example, the research evidence \[R4\] informed the development of a mobile gaming app by Rocket Impact — a technology start\-up company — to encourage physical activity, which is now commercially available across the UK \[E8\]<ins>.</ins> 

 Similarly, our evidence on inclusion \[R5\] was included in the design of **continuing professional development** with Activity Alliance who changed their professional training/development workshops for teachers to include a focus on inquiry in inclusion \[E9\]. This has impacted on *c*.14,500 UK teachers and *c*.340,000 young people. Guidelines have since been adopted by 30 workshop tutors, who deliver training to *c*.900 teachers per year; this impacts on *c*.50,000 young people. 

 Finally, safeguarding **practices have been changed** at The Football Association \(FA\) to address potential risks for the online safety of youth sport coaches. The FA stated: 

 \[Griffiths’ and Goodyear’s\] body of work \[R6\] helped us to \[… be\] more aware of the need to manage individuals who are over and under 16 in digital spaces \[… and\] define better working practices with regards to education and digital/online safeguarding principles as they relate to Football. \[E10\] 

 This change to practice and has impacted on the learning of over 6,000 international sport coaches from 155 different countries \[E10\]. The FA have since adopted these safeguarding principles for their online training platform that reaches 80,000 football coaches, with 30,000 working with 5–11 age groups \[E10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Oxford has changed the treatment and prevention of post\-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\). The researchers developed and validated a psychological model of the key factors that lead to PTSD. A novel form of cognitive therapy \(CT\-PTSD\) that specifically targets these psychological processes was then developed and shown to be highly acceptable and highly effective. CT\-PTSD received the highest recommendation as a first\-line intervention in the revised *NICE PTSD guidelines* \(2018\), and the clinical guidelines of the *American Psychological Association* \(2016\) and *International Society for Traumatic Stress Disorders* \(2019\). CT\-PTSD has been made widely available in the NHS through *Improving Access to Psychological Therapies* \(4,800 therapists trained and over 74,000 patients treated between 2013 and 2020\), in secondary and tertiary care services and by being disseminated in 143 other countries. The researchers have also developed an effective prevention programme designed to reduce the risk of PTSD in emergency workers and other people exposed to high levels of stress that is being widely rolled out in the UK in collaboration with the charity MIND. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 PTSD is a disabling condition that may develop after traumatic events such as disaster, interpersonal violence, severe accidents or war zone experiences. Epidemiological studies and the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey suggest that 2\-3% of adults in the UK suffer from PTSD \(1\-1.5 million\). PTSD interferes severely with the individual's relationships with others and ability to work. If untreated, it can lead to secondary mental health problems, substance misuse, and an increased risk of cardiovascular illness or suicide. 

####  A cognitive model of PTSD and evidence 

 Ehlers and Clark’s group at Oxford developed a psychological model \[1\] that accounts for the development and persistence of PTSD in individuals who have experienced traumatic events by a combination of three factors: 1\) excessively negative appraisals, i.e. interpretations that the trauma and/or its consequences indicate a current threat, 2\) characteristics of trauma memories and their triggers leading to unwanted re\-experiencing of distressing moments of the trauma, and 3\) problematic behaviours and cognitive strategies that prevent the appraisals and memories from changing, such as excessive precautions and rumination about the trauma. 

 Experiments and prospective prediction studies conducted by Ehlers and Clark’s team at Oxford provided strong support for Ehlers and Clark’s model \[ **1**\], for example in the prediction of PTSD in traumatized individuals \[ **2, 3, 4**\]. A prospective study of PTSD following assault, conducted by the Oxford team, supported key hypotheses drawn from the model by suggesting that peritraumatic cognitive processing and disorganized memories are related to the development of PTSD  \[ **2**\]. A path analysis of a large longitudinal study of trauma survivors comprehensively tested the maintaining factors of the model and showed that the causal relationships proposed in the model are consistent with the data \[ **3**\]. The University of Oxford team also showed that the factors specified in the model \[ **1**\] predict the risk of developing PTSD after subsequent trauma exposure in emergency workers through a prospective study of pre\-trauma predictors \[ **4**\]. These studies provided important evidence for the underlying model and have implications for the treatment and prevention of PTSD. 

####  Development of an effective cognitive therapy for PTSD 

 Ehlers and Clark’s model was used by the University of Oxford team to generate a specific cognitive therapy for PTSD \(CT\-PTSD\) which aims to correct the three central psychological factors identified in the model \(described in \[ **1**\]\). The first randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\) of cognitive therapy for PTSD, which were run with patients in Oxford and Northampton between February 1998 and January 2001 \[ **5**\], showed that CT\-PTSD is effective in treating chronic PTSD and as an early intervention to prevent the development of chronic PTSD. The treatment has been shown to be effective in adults and children, leading to recovery from PTSD in over 70% of the cases, very large reductions of PTSD symptom severity and improvements in social life and ability to work, and in quality of life \(pre\-post intent\-to\-treat treatment effect sizes 2.5, 1.6, and 1.1, respectively\). This is an advance over earlier forms of cognitive behaviour therapy, which achieved completer effect sizes for PTSD symptom severity of around 1.5 \(meta\-analysis by Van Etten & Taylor, 1998\). Another advantage is that the treatment is highly acceptable to patients, with lower dropout rates \(6% on average in RCTs\) than have been reported for other psychological trauma\-focused treatments \(23% on average according to meta\-analyses\). Thus, more people are able to complete the treatment and recover. 

 More recently, Ehlers’ group developed modifications in the delivery format of CT\-PTSD that increase patient choice and the efficiency of the treatment. Their RCTs showed in 2014 that the treatment was as effective in the form of an intensive intervention delivered over just 7 days as it was in a weekly format, and both are superior to supportive therapy \[ **6**\]. 

####  Development of an effective PTSD prevention programme for emergency workers 

 Drawing on the results of references \[ **3**\] and \[ **4**\] and therapeutic procedures from CT\-PTSD \[ **1, 5, 6**\], Wild developed a digitally delivered prevention programme that modifies relevant cognitive predictors of PTSD and depression in emergency workers. An RCT showed it was effective in increasing well\-being and reducing the risk of PTSD and Depression symptoms following subsequent trauma exposure \[D\(ii\)<ins>\]</ins>. This represents an advance over previous resilience training programmes, which were shown to be ineffective \[D\(iii\)<ins>\]</ins>.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research described above has had a major impact on the diagnosis and treatment outcomes of PTSD in the NHS and overseas, and on the delivery of more effective resilience training to emergency workers and other people exposed to high levels of stress. 

####  UK and international clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of PTSD 

 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) has issued revised guidelines on the optimal treatment of PTSD \(NG116, 2018\) on the basis of a meta\-analysis of RCTs. Based on the RCTs conducted at Oxford \(e.g. \[ **5, 6**\]\), CT\-PTSD received the highest level of endorsement as a first\-choice treatment for acute and chronic PTSD. The guidelines state that cognitive therapy for PTSD should be used as a psychological intervention for the prevention of PTSD in adults \(1.6.15\) and as a treatment for adults with a diagnosis of PTSD or clinically important symptoms of PTSD \(1.6.16\) \[A\(i\)\]. Similarly, the clinical guidelines of the American Psychological Association \(2017\) state *“For adult patients with PTSD, the panel strongly recommends that clinicians offer … cognitive therapy \(CT\) ...*” \[A\(ii\), Table 1\]. The International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies \(2019\) also give a ‘Strong Recommendation’ to CT\-PTSD as a first\-line intervention on the basis of their meta\-analysis \[A\(iii\)\]. 

####  CT for PTSD disseminated within the English NHS and Northern Ireland 

 CT\- PTSD \[ **1, 5, 6**\] is now widely taught in the UK and is included in the national training curriculum for *Improving Access to Psychological Therapies \(IAPT\)* high intensity therapists \[B\] and is taught on the majority of IAPT high intensity therapy courses. Since August 2013, around 4,800 IAPT therapists have learned the treatment approach and are delivering it in over 180 local services \(over 74,000 patients treated since 2013, currently over 10,000 per year\) \[C\], in addition to patients treated in secondary and tertiary care. The treatment is taught on other post\-graduate diploma courses in psychological therapies and in specialist CBT diploma/ MSc course at Queens University, Belfast \(180 therapists trained in the treatment approach on these courses since August 2013\) and clinical psychology courses. In the early stages of the COVID pandemic, the Oxford team were asked to give webinars for NHS England on how to remotely deliver CT for PTSD \(viewed by 3,270 clinicians until 31/07/20\) and traumatic bereavement \(2,779 clinicians\). The Oxford team was also commissioned by Health Education England to offer a national top\-up training for high intensity IAPT therapists delivering CT\-PTSD, starting in November 2020. 

####  PTSD prevention and stress resilience training 

 The PTSD prevention programme developed by the Oxford group on the basis of the prospective studies \[ **3**, **4**\] is a recommended intervention for emergency workers and is being disseminated across England and Wales through the Blue Light Programme \[D\(i\)<ins>\]</ins>. By December 2020, 32 emergency services across England and Wales have benefited to date with an additional 10 services currently undergoing training. The benefits have been twofold: access to evidence\-based training, and significant improvements in wellbeing as measured by the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale \[D\(i\)<ins>\]</ins>. Newly recruited emergency workers \(223 to Dec 2020\) have benefited from the programme with significant improvements in confidence managing their mental health once they start full\-time work, and another 570 student paramedics at 15 universities across England have completed the programme \[E\(i\)<ins>\]</ins>. During 2020 the programme was also being delivered to paramedics in Singapore during the COVID pandemic. 

 The prevention programme also forms the basis of current resilience and wellbeing interventions, training and outreach programmes that the mental health charity, Mind, is delivering across England and Wales \[E\]. For example, the intervention is now being routinely offered across 16 Local Minds in Wales \(80% of the Local Minds available in Wales\) to support a range of people exposed to stress, including 350 older adults, 1,600 university students and families of military veterans \(120 people\) by December 2020. These recipients have benefited with significant improvements in wellbeing as measured by the short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale \[D\(ii\)\]. 

####  Impact on international diagnostic criteria for PTSD 

 The Oxford group’s research provided evidence for changes in diagnostic criteria for PTSD in the DSM\-5 \(American Psychiatric Association, 2013\) and ICD\-11 \(World Health Organization, 2018\) \[F\]. Ehlers’ research showing that ruminative thoughts about trauma are functionally different from intrusive memories \(as developed in \[ **1**\] and \[ **3**\]\) led to a revision of DSM criterion B1 to “ *restrict this criterion to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories*” \[F\(i\). Similarly the findings on appraisals in Ehlers’ research led to new symptoms in cluster D \(“ *Negative alterations in cognitions and mood that are associated with the traumatic event\(s\)*”\) \[F\(i\)\]. Ehlers’ research on the perceived ‘nowness’ of trauma memories and the model’s emphasis of a sense of current threat \[ **1**, **2**\] was included to define the ICD\-11 \(2019\) symptom clusters “ *re\-experiencing in the present*” and “ *persistent perceptions of heightened current threat*” \[F\(ii\), citing \[1\]; and F\(iii\), disorder 6B40\]. 

####  International recognition and dissemination of CT for PTSD 

 The outstanding results obtained with CT\-PTSD have led clinicians and health service commissioners from many countries to request training. Since August 2013, Ehlers and her team have provided 112 workshops on the treatment in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, The Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, Ukraine, Greece, Poland, Hungary, Israel, Sudan, China, Australia and the USA, reaching a combined total of 6,756 attendees, the majority of whom were clinical psychologists, CBT practitioners, psychiatrists and nurse practitioners. A treatment manual and therapist training videos are available free of charge at the Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma website \[G\]. Between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2019 and 28<sup>th</sup> October 2020, 15,340 therapists from 143 countries registered for this training website. A German therapist manual has also been published \(Hogrefe, over 5,000 sales since August 2013\). A Japanese manual is also available. The treatment was successfully implemented in several Scandinavian countries. It was delivered in a primary care intervention study in Stockholm, with similar effect sizes to the ones in Ehlers et al.’s randomised controlled trials \[H\]. It is now being rolled out into secondary care services in Norway, in a large government funded project \[H\]. The success of intensive, 7 day version of CT\-PTSD has stimulated the implementation of intensive treatment programmes in several countries including the Netherlands \(e.g. \[I\]\) and the USA.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Beyond Youth Custody \(BYC\) \(2012\-2018\) improved understanding of effective post\-custodial resettlement, reshaping policy and practice for young people in and leaving Secure Children’s Homes, Secure Training Centres and Young Offender Institutions.  BYC’s *Framework for Resettlement* \(a theory of change\) underpins the Probation Inspectorate’s inspection criteria \(HMIP, 2015\); the Youth Justice Board’s ‘constructive resettlement’ strategy \(YJB, 2018\); *National Standards* \(Ministry of Justice, 2019\) and *Case Management Guidance* for the youth justice sector on children’s resettlement \(YJB, 2020\). It also informs London’s strategy to reduce youth offending in the capital \(London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, 2015\); and is cited as central to resettlement in the *Guide to Youth Justice in Scotland* \(CYCJ, 2015\). Developments underpinned by BYC have supported youth justice professionals to embed effective resettlement practices and benefited children in and leaving custody, amongst the most vulnerable in society. 
","
 **2. Underpinning Research** 

 There are around 600 children and young people aged 10\-17 years held in the secure estate \(Secure Children’s Homes, Secure Training Centres and Young Offender Institutions\) in England and Wales, more than half of whom are Black, Asian and Ethnic Minority \(BAME\) \(Bateman, 2020\). Research indicates that prior to custody 39% had been the subject of a child protection plan and more than a quarter \(27%\) had spent time in care. Almost half had been excluded from school, one in five had self\-harmed and 11% had attempted suicide. Effective resettlement is important to safeguard and promote the welfare of these children and reduce reoffending; but evidence suggests that two\-thirds of children reoffend within 12 months of release from secure institutions and this figure is substantially higher for children sentenced to less than 12 months imprisonment \( **Bateman** et al, 2013a\) **\[3.1\].** 

 Beyond Youth Custody \(BYC\) \(2012\-2018\) was an England wide collaboration between the University of Bedfordshire \(UoB\), Applied Research in Community Safety \(ARCS UK\), the University of Salford, and Nacro, a social justice charity. The team was funded by the Big Lottery to develop, and disseminate, a robust\-evidence base in relation to the resettlement on children and young people leaving custody. BYC worked alongside 15 *Youth in Focus* \(YIF\) resettlement projects. The UoB research team played a leading role in the design, deployment and outputs of the programme of research outlined below. Staff from the UoB co\-authored 22 of the 37 outputs produced by BYC and led work on: reviewing the literature; the engagement of children and young people in resettlement; resettlement of girls and young women \(which built on earlier work undertaken at UoB \( **Bateman, Melrose and Brodie,** 2013b\) **\[3.3\]**\); gangs and resettlement; and measuring effectiveness in resettlement. All partners contributed to designing and building the BYC framework for effective resettlement. 

 The UoB research team was central to building a robust evidence base on effective resettlement. We did this by addressing key elements of the resettlement task and the resettlement process that had previously received little or no attention. For example, the experiences of girls and young women and BAME young people in and after custody, and the impact of gang involvement on resettlement had rarely been explored prior to this body of research.This evidence base – rooted in the views of children and young people  \- see **\[3.2, 3.3 and 3.4\]**– was used to challenge, advance and promote clearer thinking in policy and practice for the effective resettlement of young people leaving custody. 

 **Bateman** et al \(2013\) **\[3.1\]** undertook a systematic review of over 100 academic outputs and ‘grey’ literature \(including policy, practice guidance, legislation, statistical data\), pertaining to the resettlement of children and young people in England and Wales which was augmented by interviews with resettlement professionals in the 15 YIF projects. This methodology was designed to facilitate shared learning across resettlement services for young people and to contribute to the development of evidence\-based resettlement policy and practice, building upon the learning of professionals working in the field. The findings highlighted the areas where future BYC work should focus. These included engagement with young people, the need to acknowledge violence and sexual abuse in the backgrounds of girls and young women in custody and the over\-representation of BAME young people among those deprived of their liberty. The review also identified the distinctive challenges associated with the resettlement of gang\-involved children and young people and pointed to the centrality of effective multi\-agency collaboration in effective resettlement. 

 A study exploring the centrality of engaging young people in resettlement provision, as a prerequisite of promoting desistance, and a core element of relationship\-based practice \( **Bateman** and Hazel, 2014\) **\[3.2\]**, integrated the wider literature on engagement with the experiences of resettlement practitioners working in the 15 YIF projects. The research explored the meaning of engagement in a youth justice context, the barriers to children engaging with resettlement support and effective mechanisms for maximizing engagement. It developed a framework for understanding engagement as a three stage model of transformation, that prefigured, in some respects, and informed the latter framework for effective resettlement. A subsequent study on girls and young women leaving custody, building heavily on previous research undertaken by the UoB \( **Bateman et al**, 2013b\) **\[3.3\]** cross\-referenced evidence of ‘what works’ in the resettlement of young people with the academic literature on desistance and what was learned in the 25 interviews with young women, both in custody and following release. This iterative synthesis also aimed to demonstrate how a gendered perspective could be applied in both policy and practice. 

 The relationship between ethnicity and youth custody came to the fore in *Gang\-involved young people: Custody and beyond* \( **Factor** and **Pitts**, 2015\) **\[3.6\]**. In 2013/14, 16% of boys in young offender institutions \(YOIs\) reported having experienced ‘gang problems’ when they first arrived at the establishment \(rising to 21% for BAME young people\). The research revealed that what happens in the secure estate has a significant impact on whether and how gang\-involved young people engage with resettlement services. The research was based upon a systematic review of the English language literature on the rehabilitation of gang\-involved young people aged 10 to 25. Interviews were conducted with19 gang\-involved young people aged between 16 and 25. Five policy makers and 27 practitioners attended focus groups in south\-east and north\-west England where the implication of the observations of the young people and the key findings of the literature review for policy and practice were explored. 

 *Custody to Community: How Young People Cope with Release* \( **Bateman** and Hazel, 2015\) **\[3.4\]** involved analysis of 57 interview transcripts, drawn from a variety of studies, of young people’s experiences in the criminal justice system. The findings pointed to the disorientation which precede reorientation and the role of resettlement professionals is supporting young people through these stages and responding to the trauma many of them were experiencing during this time. 

 Overall, the BYC research programme highlighted that resettlement was often ineffective because there had been no unifying aim for resettlement beyond the prevention of reoffending and no theory of change. In the absence of a theory of change, there was no shared perception between the relevant agencies about how multi\-agency resettlement planning might work in practice \( **Bateman** and Hazel, 2018\) **\[3.5\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 <ins>Overview of impact</ins> 

 The HMI Probation inspection of services for youth resettlement noted that a body of previous research evidence on what helps children leaving custody to stop offending had not resulted in changes in practice or improved outcomes \(HMI Probation, 2015, Foreword\) **\[5.1\]**.  BYC was described by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales \(YJB\) as being ‘pivotal’ to understanding the reasons why the evidence base had had a limited impact. It also highlighted that the programme had provided a theory of change to underpin more effective service responses and guide the approaches adopted by professionals to work with this group \(YJB, 2018, p.7\) **\[5.2 and 5.3\]**. 

 BYC cross\-referenced the responses of young people, practitioners and policy\-makers with theoretical perspectives on gender, ethnicity, trauma and desistance to develop a theory of change which served as the basis for the, now extensively adopted, *Framework for Resettlement* \(Beyond Youth Custody, 2017\). The model argued that guidance had focused on issues of process rather than recognising that effective practice consists in the provision of  personal and structural support that enables children and young people to see themselves in positive terms, with a constructive,crime free future, rather than as ‘offenders’, constrained by their past mistakes. The framework identifies five characteristics of effective resettlement support that BYC research has shown are crucial to effectiveness and sustainability:1.Constructive 2. Co\-created 3. Customised 4. Consistent 5. Co\-ordinated **\[5.5\]**. 

 <ins>Dissemination to and impact with practitioners</ins> 

 The framework, designed as a resource for policy makers, decision makers and academics studying youth justice has been widely adopted \(as specified below\) by voluntary services  \(e.g. The Prisoners’ Education Trust and St Basils Trust\) and statutory providers, including the South London Resettlement Consortium, Kent, Medway, Lewisham and Leeds youth offending services and the South and West Yorkshire Resettlement Consortium. The manager of the  latter reflected that: ‘ *the work with BYC and the knowledge and understanding of the theory of change gained by practitioners has seen developments locally which have supported youth justice professionals to embed effective resettlement practices and benefitted children in custody who are among the most vulnerable in society*’ **\[5.4\].** 

 Over the course of the programme, nearly 700 stakeholders, the majority being youth justice practitioners, signed up to receive BYC’s quarterly e\-news updates which included information on the latest findings from the research and practice guidance. This effective communication with practitioners in youth offending teams and custodial institutions, as policy makers, ensured that visits to the website increased every year of the programme: in 2012 the total number of page views was 11,403; by 2018 this was 80,724, 64% of whom were new visitors demonstrating the growing reach of the project over time. The website provided free access to all of BYCs publications, and the majority of visits resulted in downloads of research reports or guidance documents. BYC’s research forms a fundamental part of the Custody and Resettlement module in the *Youth Justice Effective Practice Certificate* launched in 2018. The course, the primary professional qualification for youth justice practitioners, is endorsed by the YJB and delivered by Unitas and the University of Suffolk. 

 <ins>Adoption of the BYC model</ins> 

 The YJB recommended the adoption of the framework to resettlement consortia and have noted that the ‘research\-informed principles for effective resettlement from custody apply equally to work with other high\-risk children’ \(YJB, 2018, p.3\) **\[5.2\].** The framework has been incorporated into the inspection criteria developed by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation’s thematic inspection of youth resettlement \(HMI Probation, 2015\) \[ **5.1\]**. It also forms the basis of the YJB’s \(2018\) approach to “constructive resettlement” which it established as one of six strategic priorities in the Board’s *Strategic Plan 2019\-2022* \(YJB, 2019\). BYC’s key principles of effective resettlement were also adopted by the London Assembly in its strategy to reduce youth reoffending in the capital \(London Assembly Policy and Crime Committee, 2015\) **\[5.5\]**. BYCs framework was acknowledged as being the basis of the Centre for Youth and Criminal Justice’s \(2019\) *Guide to Youth Justice in Scotland: policy, practice and legislation* section on reintegration and transitions **\[5.6\].** The latest *Standards for Children in the Youth Justice system* \(Ministry of Justice, 2019\) **\[5.7\]** also explicitly acknowledge the importance of transition plans that set out “the personal and structural support to be made available to support the child develop a pro\-social identity. Identify the child’s strengths and capacities \(and those of the wider community around them\) and set out how these factors will impact upon the activities and be built into a full desistance plan” \(Standard 5, p.17\), in line with recommendations from BYC.  The “constructive resettlement” approach, based on the BYC model, including desistance through identity shift, also informs national *Case Management Guidance on Custody and Resettlement* \(YJB, 2020\) for youth offending team practitioners and managers **\[5.8\].** The work of BYC was also cited by the Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology in its report on *Education of Young People Leaving Custody* \(Ravenscroft and Hobbs, 2016\) **\[5.9\].** Drawing on a cost benefit analysis by Renshaw \(2007\) they suggested that good quality resettlement could save over GBP20,000 per offender per year, if it reduced the frequency of re\-offending by 35% and the severity of offences by 10%. 

 <ins>Embedding the legacy</ins> 

 The programme culminated in a Parliamentary Conference in 2018 addressed by the Chair of the YJB and the Minister for Youth Justice, to celebrate the successes of the programme and embed its legacy **\[5.10\].**

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Between 1918−1987, at least 20 million detainees were confined in Soviet prison camps later known as the Gulag. Dr Gullotta’s research brings to light cultural aspects of Gulag life including detainees’ resistance using art and literature, and the Russian government’s ‘memory war’ attempting to rewrite the historical narrative of the Gulag. His findings have formed the basis of public outreach including a permanent Hunterian Museum digital exhibition *Beauty in Hell* and have supported and enhanced the work of NGOs Memorial and Rights in Russia, human rights organisations whose work includes advocating against a return to totalitarianism, in part through commemorating the victims of the Soviet Gulag. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Andrea Gullotta’s body of work, emerging from his doctoral research but developed substantially since his employment at UofG in 2015, has focused on the system of Russian forced labour camps known as the Gulag. These camps were active in the Soviet Union from the Russian Civil War until the 1980s. At least 20 million people  [were incarcerated in them](https://gulagmap.ru/). Gullotta’s research, based on largely unpublished archival materials, in contrast to existing ideas of ‘Gulag literature’ and ‘Gulag culture’, offers a nuanced understanding of the importance of culture for prisoners and camp institutions. 

 By revealing what was written and created by prisoners within the camps, Gullotta illuminated complex dynamics between camp administrators and prisoners, and strategies used to avoid censorship or punishment and to defy the guards. Gullotta also brought to light the role of camp administrators in supporting cultural activities of the prisoners, and changed the perception of some historical figures. For example, Fedor Eikhmans was previously known only as a Chekist and first leader of the Gulag institution, but because of Gullotta’s research is now also recognised as someone who helped intellectuals. 

 Through film, text and images documenting camp lives and culture, Gullotta examined the Solovki Camp in depth, showing how the cultural activity of the artists, writers and other dissident intellectuals held there formed a resistance to the systematic violence and oppression of the camp. Poems, essays and even research by prisoners within the camp – for example Boris Evreinov’s poetry, or various activities pursued by the intellectuals in the many camps – are viewed through this lens as acts of resistance. Gullotta’s research into these phenomena formed the basis of a permanent digital exhibition at the Hunterian Museum, *Beauty in Hell* \[3.1\]. 

 Gullotta’s subsequent monograph on the history, cultural dynamics and literary outputs of the Solovki prison camp \[3.2\] further developed this new interpretation of Gulag literature. Past scholarship tended to present an externalised perspective of the Gulag, for example focusing on works produced by survivors after liberation, and presenting more survival\-oriented narratives of their experience. Gullotta has shown the multifaceted nature of literature behind the Gulag’s iron fence, paving the way for a new field of research within both Gulag studies and Russian literary studies – ‘internal’ Gulag literature, to complement the established canon of authors who wrote after their liberation, such as 1970 Nobel prize winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. 

 Gullotta’s work demonstrates that, within the Soviet prisons and camps, many intellectuals were allowed to publish original literary works \[3.4\]. It shows how culture within the camps was a more complex phenomenon than historians had hitherto recognised. For instance, the literary works of Boris Shiriaev, thought to be inspired by Soviet propaganda, were reinterpreted in the exhibition and monograph as instances of resistance, based on the use of Aesopian language. Gullotta’s research has thus demonstrated the artistic, literary and spiritual value of the cultural works made by prisoners, as well as their active use as a tool for intellectual resistance \[3.3, 3.5\]. 

 In carrying out this research, Gullotta witnessed active resistance and interference of state actors towards NGOs and researchers working on the Gulag. This became a focus of his work, and he has described this phenomenon as an ongoing ‘memory war’ over how the Gulag are understood, taking place over several decades \[3.5\], and Gullotta’s forthcoming monograph on the Gulag Memory War\]. Gullotta’s work reveals how Russian institutions initially ignored, then hindered, and latterly tried to control the memory of the Gulag, and how in contemporary Russian historical narrative, the place of the Gulag, and the millions of political prisoners, is under direct threat. The Russian authorities’ counter\-narrative strategy includes impeding funding for NGOs such as Memorial, the construction of a new \(state\-controlled\) Museum of the Gulag, promoting a state\-determined revisionist historical viewpoint, and the wrongful imprisonment of Gulag historians such as Yuri Dimitriev.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 Gullotta’s research and his public outreach work is helping to counter the increasing spread of disinformation on the realities and significance of Soviet history, in particular of the Gulag and their millions of detainees. Gullotta is the first researcher to have applied the term ‘memory war’ to the government\-approved discourse around the Gulag, at a December 2017 event at Pushkin House, London, organised by the British NGO Rights in Russia. The introduction of this term –not widely used in the Russian press or abroad – is significant because Russian institutions are actively trying to suppress or debase historical narratives of the Gulag. Independent NGOs and researchers in Russia investigating this era and the mechanisms of Soviet repression have been attacked and vilified, and existing documentation is increasingly under threat. 

 **Raising awareness of the memory war on the Gulag and the Gulag experience** 

 Gullotta’s research shows how archival documents have been disappearing and/or made less accessible, while private archives, online databases and individual publications on social media attempt to counteract this tendency. In its review of Gullotta’s work \[3.2\], the *Financial Times* notes the timeliness of the research in this regard \[5.1\]: ‘ *this book also comes at a time when access to the materials it analyzes is being limited by the Russian government’*. 

 Gullotta has worked closely with Memorial, a Russia\-based human rights organisation co\-founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner and dissident Andrei Sakharov \(himself a former political detainee\), Memorial itself having been nominated for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize. Memorial calls out political repression in both Soviet\-era and present\-day Russia, including commemorating the lives of forgotten Gulag prisoners. The Director and board member of Memorial’s St. Petersburg Office commented \[5.2\]: ‘ *Gullotta’s work has shed new light on the lives of the victims of the Gulag not simply as victims but as creative and artistic people whose output … was an important channel for resistance to the regime.... Bringing out this depth of detail and understanding of life in the Gulag ...is important, especially in the current climate in which there is a concerted effort to minimise the existence and reality of the Gulag in the contemporary history of Russia*.’ 

 Rights in Russia, a UK\-registered charity that supports the work of human rights organisations based in the Russian Federation, circulated a petition, written by Gullotta based on his findings, against the vilification and wrongful arrest of Russian Gulag historian and human rights campaigner, Yuri Dimitriev. This letter has collected 428 signatories \[5.3\], including academics, cultural figures, politicians and journalists, with notable signatories including Nobel Prize laureate John Maxwell Coetzee, Italian MPs Leah Quartapelle and Gennaro Migliore, and Robert van Voeren, the Director of the Sakharov Research Center for Democratic Development. As a result, Gullotta’s findings were used in a formal request by three Italian MPs to the Italian government to put pressure on the Russian government for the release of Dimitriev. 

 Gullotta has collaborated with Rights in Russia, including appearing by invitation on their podcast \[5.4\]. They commented that ‘ *Gullotta was the first ever to use this term, ‘Memory War,’ which has now has become widespread*’, adding that ‘ *Dr Gullotta's framework deepened our understanding of the motives of the prosecution of the Russian historian’*. They also commented on the petition against Dimitriev’s persecution, stating: ‘ *without Dr Gullotta’s research findings, it is most likely that the petition would have had less impact*.’ The publication of this signed letter has amplified media coverage of both the memory war and the injustice against Dimitriev, with coverage by the *New European* \(30<sup>th</sup> July 2020\), the *Festival of Human Rights*, Italy \(23<sup>rd</sup> July 2020\), and an interview with Gullotta published by *Meduza* \(13<sup>th</sup> July 2020\), one of the major non\-governmental platforms in Russia, which was shared on Facebook 2,100 times \[5.5\]. 

 Gullotta’s insights into creativity and continued resistance within the Gulag, communicated through his book, exhibition, press coverage, public events and work with NGOs, provides an accessible and distinct view of the Gulag. He presents these political prisoners as intellectuals and artists, highlighting their sustained resistance to oppression through their continued production of artistic and cultural activities and outputs while detained in the Gulag. His work thus directly confronts an official counter\-narrative of the Gulag’s decades\-long existence. Gullotta wrote an article for  [*The Conversation*](https://theconversation.com/russia-and-the-gulag-putin-is-fighting-for-state-control-over-how-soviet-horrors-are-remembered-142438) on this topic \(10<sup>th</sup> July 2020\), which was read by \~19,000 people and shared 578 times in the first month \[5.6\]. It was translated into Italian by *L’Internazionale*, a weekly review of significant articles worldwide with a readership of 125,000.

 Up to early 2020, *Beauty in Hell: Culture in the Gulag*, the virtual exhibition hosted by the Hunterian Museum since 2017, had over 22,500 page views by the end of December 2020 \[5.7\]. Its key message, of the sophistication of cultural activity and acts of resistance in the Gulag, has resonated with visitors. A senior Fellow of the Kennan institute \(a prominent US think tank devoted to improving American understanding of Russia\) stated \[5.8\]: ‘ *Gullotta has prepared an amazing virtual exhibition … a good starting point to get to know an unconventional and not simple theme: art behind the walls of the Gulag. … I \[hope\] Andrea and his colleagues plan to continue initiating the public to the beauty coming from other corners of the Gulag Hades*…’ The curator of another  [online exhibition](https://www.sobiboronthescreen.com/) launched on 14<sup>th</sup> October 2020, specifically on a Gulag rebellion at the Sobibor camp, has also used Gullotta’s research to underpin their activity \[5.9\]. 

 The findings, imagery and documents from the exhibition have also been used in public engagement by Gullotta, for example at the annual European Researchers’ Night \(Explorathon\), at Glasgow’s Riverside Museum \(2019\). Typical comments received include one  [visitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNFbmcKhDgw) saying they *'knew about the Holocaust, \[but\] never knew anything about the Gulag*.’ At another public talk in Gorizia, Italy, 2019, 78% of 45 attendees surveyed said their understanding of the Gulag and Gulag culture had been changed; the remaining 22% desired to know more. 80% had no prior knowledge of Gulag culture \[5.10\]. These talks relate to a subject only just gaining recognition, as indicated by the fact that Memorial’s  [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Memorial.International/) has \~24,400 followers. However, the topic has political and moral resonance with the public at a time when disinformation remains a major cultural challenge on an unprecedented scale, and Gullotta’s work makes a key contribution.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research carried out within the Department of Environment and Geography by the York Centre of the Stockholm Environment Institute \(SEI York\) has been used to drive national agendas to include mitigation of Short\-Lived Climate Pollutants \(SLCPs\). This builds on our contribution to a UN Environment \(UNEP\) and World Meteorological Organisation \(WMO\) global assessment on black carbon and tropospheric ozone and formation of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition \(CCAC\). Our researchers have informed development of integrated air quality and climate strategies in 16 countries resulting in high\-level political endorsement of national action plans to reduce SLCPs in Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Mexico, Bangladesh, Maldives, Colombia and Togo. In addition, Chile and Mexico have adopted black carbon targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions \(NDCs\) to mitigate climate change; and Bangladesh and Dominican Republic have acknowledged the support given by our researchers in their revised NDCs. Our research is cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) in support of their demand that the global response to climate change must be strengthened. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

  

 Since 2012, the York Centre of the Stockholm Environment Institute \(SEI York\), based in the Department of Environment and Geography at the University of York, has been at the forefront of research into SLCPs. SEI York research has provided evidence that SLCPs, such as black carbon \(aka soot\), methane, ground\-level ozone and hydrofluorocarbons \(HFCs\), not only have a potent impact on climate change, but all except HFCs also impact on human health through people’s exposure to polluted air. SEI York’s body of research provides evidence, often for the first time, of the global extent of the harms which air pollution causes to health as well as its impact on climate change, and outlines the practical steps which governments and policy\-makers can take to mitigate detriment to both. The SEI York team’s research \(3.1\) was instrumental in demonstrating the most effective strategies for mitigating SLCPs, simultaneously improving health and reducing harmful climate effects in the near\-term. This highlighted that if the 16 measures were applied globally between 2010\- 2030 to reduce emissions of methane and black carbon and co\-pollutants, that the rate of warming could be halved by 2050. These mitigation measures would result in the avoidance of millions of premature deaths from air pollution in 2030 and subsequent years, and the avoidance of tens of millions of tonnes of crop losses from reduced ozone formation. 

 SEI’s initiative on Low Emission Development Pathways is designed to help policy\-makers and planners to develop mitigation scenarios informed by quantitative assessments of SLCPs, Greenhouse Gases \(GHGs\) and air pollutant emission scenarios, and their impacts on health, crop yields and climate \(3.2\). Kuylenstierna, Hicks, Malley and Vallack developed a new application of the widely used energy and climate planning research tool: the Low Emissions Analysis Platform system \(LEAP\), by adding: i\) air pollution scenario estimation capabilities; ii\) non\-energy emission sources; and iii\) the development of an Integrated Benefits Calculator \(IBC\) that can estimate PM<sub>2.5</sub> \(fine particulate matter which is inhaled deeply into the lungs and causes significant health detriment\) and ozone concentrations, that have subsequent impacts on premature mortality and crop losses \(3.2\). 

 The research provided evidence to promote mitigation of SLCPs in countries \(3.3\) by developing the first global assessment of the effect of exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> air pollution on the extent of preterm births \(< 37 weeks of gestation\) around the world, which is a major cause of postnatal death and a significant cause of long\-term loss of human potential. The research estimated that between 13\-24% of preterm births were associated with maternal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and provided robust and politically relevant evidence for the health benefits of reducing exposure to indoor pollutants. 

 Following the 2015 revelations that automotive manufacturers had been using ‘defeat devices’ to hide the true extent of nitrogen oxide \(NOx\) emissions from diesel vehicles, SEI York researchers published a study \(3.4\) which was the first to quantify the effects of excess NOx emissions related to the ‘defeat devices’ \(software deliberately misleading regulatory testing of emissions\) on both public health \(global mortality estimates\) and the environment. The study examined 11 major vehicle markets, representing >80% of new diesel vehicle sales in 2015, finding that the hidden excess emissions amounted to 4.6m tons \(53% higher than the expected emissions\), associated with 38,000 premature deaths in 2015 alone. 

 Later research \(3.5\) built on their earlier findings to examine the influence of ambient air pollution on asthma: they were able to demonstrate the global asthma burden attributable to the effect of ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, for the first time, estimating that 9,000,000 \- 23,000,000 and 5,000,000 \- 10,000,000 annual asthma emergency room visits in 2015 were as a result of the influence of ozone and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, representing 8\-20% and 4\-9% of the annual number of global visits, respectively. 

 The SEI York team synthesised the results of their research on the health and climate effects of SLCPs in a 2017 paper \(3.6\), which presents an ambitious yet achievable pathway towards reducing mean global warming by 50% by 2042 through reducing emissions of SLCPs and eliminating hydrofluorocarbons. The paper speaks directly to governments seeking to meet their commitments to both the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and is referred to by the IPCC \(section 4\). The paper builds on \(3.1\) to further develop the concept of SLCPs, which have now been included in various countries’ NDCs under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\) \(e.g. in Ghana quote in Section 4, and Nigeria testimonial \- 5.3a\).

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Given the importance of reducing SLCPs, both in terms of climate change and the impact of air pollution on human health, SEI York has undertaken significant work to translate its research findings to policy\-influencing organisations and policy\-makers in national governments, and is described by the former Chief Scientist of UNEP as “ *one of the most effective and important institutions working in the world on cutting edge science\-policy issues*” \(5.1\). 

 Prior to this REF period, SEI York worked closely with UNEP to persuade governments to act on its research \(3.1\), leading to the formation in 2012 of the international Climate and Clean Air Coalition \(CCAC\) which has a mission to work with state and non\-state partners to reduce SLCPs. SEI was the first non\-state partner to join CCAC and since August 2013 the SEI York team has continued to play a major role in the development of key initiatives, especially in relation to Supporting National Action and Planning \(SNAP\) and regional assessments. The Head of the CCAC Secretariat states that “ *The SEI team at the University of York…is instrumental in the work that our initiative supporting the development of National Plans on short\-lived climate pollutants is implementing in about 20 countries*” \(5.2\). As of November 2020 CCAC has 70 state partners and 76 non\-state partners, and is described as “ *one of the premier institutions worldwide catalysing actions that combat both air pollution and climate change simultaneously*” \(5.1\). Kuylenstierna and Emberson sit on the CCAC Scientific Advisory Panel, ensuring that SEI York research informs the strategic direction of the coalition. 

 As part of the SNAP initiative, SEI York researchers worked directly with governments, training them to use the LEAP\-IBC tool to quantify emissions and model scenarios for reduced air pollution \(5.2\) and providing expert scientific and technical input into policy drafts to ensure the final plans are robust and achievable. The application of SEI York research has enhanced the capacity of national governments and institutions to assess air quality and climate impacts, generate mitigation scenarios and produce National Action Plans on SLCP mitigation using LEAP\-IBC, with the following a quote from the Federal Ministry of Environment of Nigeria in their national SLCP planning document: 

 *“The LEAP\-IBC tool developed by SEI York researchers, and the training provided in August 2018 by the SEI York team to staff at the Federal Ministry of Environment in Nigeria and other national institutions has enabled us for the first time to:* 

 *\(i\) quantify emissions of air pollutants and SLCPs;* 

 *\(ii\) identify, evaluate and prioritize mitigation actions to improve air quality and mitigate climate change, and quantify the human health benefits of the mitigation measures by developing a Nigerian model for SLCPs in LEAP\-IBC with support and training from SEI.”* \(5.3a, similarly confirmed for other countries in 5.3b, c, d and e\). 

 To date seven countries have officially endorsed National Action Plans for SLCP reduction \(5.2\): Nigeria \(2018\) \(5.4a\), Côte d’Ivoire \(2020\) \(5.4b\), Bangladesh \(2020\) \(5.4c\), the Maldives \(2019\) \(5.4d\), Mexico \(2020\) \(5.4e\), Togo \(2019\) \(5.4f\) and Colombia \(2020\) \(5.4g\). The SEI York team have successfully worked with a further nine countries: Ghana \(2018\) \(5.5a\), Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Mongolia \(5.5b\), Morocco, Peru and The Philippines, to advance their commitments to SLCP reduction and move towards the creation of endorsed National Action Plans. In addition, the national planning supported by our researchers has been referenced explicitly in the revised NDC submissions by Bangladesh and the Dominican Republic to the UNFCCC in December 2020 \(5.5c and 5.5d\). 

 The multidimensional assessments enabled by the LEAP\-IBC tool, including energy planning, GHG mitigation scenarios and air quality assessment, enable governments to understand how policies affecting air quality cut across climate, and vice versa, promoting inter\-departmental dialogue and joined\-up policy planning: 

 *“SEI researchers, as part of the Climate and Clean Coalition \(CCAC\), Supporting National Action Planning \(SNAP\) initiative have provided technical support through training activities using their Low Emissions Analysis Platform – Integrated Benefits Calculator \(LEAP\-IBC\) tool to assist staff at the Ghana EPA and other national institutions in: quantifying emissions of SLCPs, air pollutants and GHGs; identifying, evaluating and prioritising mitigation actions to improve air quality and mitigate climate change and quantifying the human health benefits of the mitigation measures by developing a Ghana model for SLCPs in LEAP\-IBC with support and training from SEI York; establishing a planning process to engage stakeholders and obtain a high\-level political endorsement for the National Action Plan; training in the impacts of air pollution on human health. The discussion of the impacts has helped to increase the interest of stakeholders in Ghana to address air pollution; the integration of strategy development between air pollution and climate change, including strengthening linkages between different ministries, departments and agencies; reviewed and provided technical comments during the finalisation of Ghana’s 2nd Biennial Update Report, submitted to the UNFCCC.”* \(5.3b see also similar confirmation from other countries in 5.3a\-e\). 

##  Impact on Policy Debate 

 In addition to the concrete impacts on government policy and practice listed above, SEI York research has provided robust evidence to back calls for strengthening both global and regional climate responses, with \(3.1\) alone being cited in 94 policy documents from around the world \(5.6\). Some of the most influential organisations who use SEI York research to inform policy positions include: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change who cite  \(3.6\) in support of their recommendation that countries should focus on pathways and policies which both improve air quality and reduce impacts of climate change \(5.7 at p.268\), and; The World Health Organization \(WHO\) which cites \(3.1\) in six publications from November 2014 – March 2018 \(5.6\), including the WHO indoor air quality guidelines on household fuel consumption. 

 In summary, our research has outlined a global pathway to achieve the 1.5 degrees celsius target whilst also maximising the sustainable development benefits through reducing air pollution exposure and its impact on human health. This pathway has been emphasised in global reports of the IPCC as being the only way by which we can achieve the temperature targets outlined in the Paris agreement. This research has been operationalised through the development of national\-scale policy plans and strategies by developing country\-specific roadmaps that contribute to reducing the country's contribution to climate change whilst maximising the benefits to the health of their citizens through reducing the exposure to health\-damaging air pollution. Specifically, this research has resulted in the development of eight climate change commitments submitted to the UNFCCC that incorporate this pathway of simultaneous climate and air pollution reductions as well as eight additional national action plans that have been endorsed at ministerial or cabinet levels to identify how these climate and air pollution targets can be achieved.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Wave 2 Growth Hub \(W2GH\) Programme provided a blueprint for the UK Government to establish 38 Growth Hubs, which have supported >4.7 million small businesses across England. Lancaster University Management School’s \(LUMS\) strong record of research in entrepreneurship and small business growth led to a GBP32 million award from the UK Government’s Regional Growth Fund \(RGF\) to create Growth Hubs in 15 UK city regions. Between September 2013 and March 2017, researchers in LUMS drew substantially on their body of research to inform the design and development of the W2GH Programme. The reach of this work extended to 5,790 businesses, creating 4,108 jobs and safeguarding a further 1,442 jobs; additionally, it secured matched investment of GBP75.3 million from the private sector. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

##  Background 

 In its drive to re\-balance a London\-centric economy, the UK Government developed policy initiatives to support devolution of responsibility for local growth, job creation and infrastructure investment to the regions. In June 2013, the Cabinet Office approached research lead Hamilton to develop a GBP32 million bid to support this wider growth agenda in city regions across England. The W2GH Programme was designed and delivered, between September 2013 and March 2017, in collaboration with the Cabinet Office, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills \(BIS\), British Chambers of Commerce, BIS Local and the Department for Communities and Local Government. 

##  Leading Enterprise and Development \(LEAD\) Programme 

 In 2003, the Northwest Regional Development Agency, as part of its Alliance for Skills and Productivity, recognised a deficit in small business leadership and management skills and funded the internationally renowned research team at LUMS led by Hamilton, to design and pilot a programme to drive small business growth in the region. LEAD, first delivered in 2004, was a 10\-month leadership and management programme for small business owner\-managers. LEAD was informed by research insights related to the importance of reflective and experiential learning in developing owner managers’ leadership skills \[R1, R3\] and the relevance of networks and social interaction for business development and growth \[R2, R3\] \(\[R2\] utilised insights developed by Jack partly at the University of Aberdeen\). 

 LEAD evolved over a decade, shaped by the changing needs of business owners and reinforced by ongoing research developing theoretical insights about entrepreneurship and the regional economy \[R4\]. A dynamic iterative dialogue between researchers and small business owners underpinned the sustained development of LEAD \[R3\] and subsequent programmes based on the insights gained because of this dialogue \[R4\]. 

##  Wave 2 Growth Hub \(W2GH\) Programme 

 W2GH drew on Cope’s work on entrepreneurial learning \[R1\] and Jack’s work highlighting the importance of identifying strong social network ties to support business development \[R2\]. It was also informed by understanding generated through LEAD that reflection is a vital component of entrepreneurial learning and that this dynamic process can be fostered by and supported in strong regional networks supporting regional growth \[R1, R3, R4, R5\]. Using insights from this body of work, the research team \(Hamilton, Jack, Cope, Gordon, Dada, George and Soetanto\) designed and delivered the W2GH Programme. In stepping into the sphere of regional economic governance, working with Government and developing complex regional networks to deliver a policy initiative that would significantly impact small business growth and economic development and show the central role of learning in developing entrepreneurial ecosystems \[R6\]. This initiative and work was unprecedented. 

 Research insights showed how a university could instigate networks high in trust and that support learning through peer\-to\-peer activities driving small business growth and regional economic development \[R3, R4, R6\]. Meanwhile, these research insights informed and extended small business engagement led by George and Gordon within regional networks \[R5\], driving new research questions. The body of work built an understanding of how universities enhance regional and national economic growth \[R4\] and different models for how this might be achieved \[R5, R6\]. In their research on local entrepreneurial eco\-system development, published in 2019, Pugh, Soetanto, Jack and Hamilton identified and developed an “integrated learning model” for delivering impactful programmes to small businesses \[R6\] at the regional and national levels \[R4\].

 **4. Details of the Impact** 

##  W2GH impact on regional and local economic development 

 In March 2019, figures audited for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \[S1\] confirmed that: 

-  4,108 private sector jobs had been created; 

-  1,442 jobs had been safeguarded; 

-  5,790 businesses had been supported; 

-  >67,000 SMEs had engaged with local Growth Hubs; 

-  GBP75.3 million of investment from the private sector had been secured, surpassing the mandated target of GBP2 million private\-to\-public\-sector investment. 

 The Head of National Programmes for the Regional Growth Directorate acknowledged this outstanding achievement, stating that Lancaster not only achieved its challenging objectives but also exceeded the brief, delivering an exceptional programme “ *that sets the standards for others to attain and furthermore delivers a knowledge base that will support and inform for years to come*” \[S2\]. Growth Hubs now operate across England, and the processes, tools and knowledge exchange established in the W2GH Programme continue to support economic growth \[S3\]. 

 The research team’s findings showed university engagement instigates networks high in trust, which support reflective learning \[R3\]. Informed by these insights, the W2GH Programme brought together local partners through workshops, showcase events and knowledge\-sharing initiatives, ultimately driving small business growth and regional economic development \[S4\]. 

 The impact of the Growth Hubs from the point of view of regional small business was unambiguously beneficial. Feedback from small business owners included; the Managing Director of Kamm Design, who said that support received from the Growth Hub, “ *will now enable us to further develop a ground breaking product and put the area on the map as a provider of excellence in this sector*” \[S4\(a\)\], and the Director of Gilca ltd, who said that the support from their local Growth Hub allowed them to “ *access new markets, consolidate the markets we’ve got, and take on new employees*” \[S4\(b\)\]. 

 The research\-informed \[R1, R2, R3\] design and management of the programme also enhanced the effectiveness of the Growth Hub network, as stated by the Programme Manager of the Dorset Growth Hub who said, “ *The most important thing about working with Lancaster is the network. It helps us to benchmark where we are in terms of the setup and delivery, and it helps us to share best practice*” \[S4\(b\)\]. The way the theory\-driven programme design \[R4, R5\] shaped the success of the Growth Hubs was exemplified by the Chief Executive of the Wessex Chambers of Commerce who said, “ *we’ve now got one place where businesses can access all the support they need, which should make a big difference towards helping our business community*” \[S4\(a\)\]. 

##  Impact on government policy and expansion of the Growth Hub model 

 In November 2014, the House of Commons Select Committee invited the research team to give evidence to inform policy on government support for business. The submission proposed, “ *there should be limited change in the infrastructure for business support in the next five years”* and argued such infrastructure should be *“based on an efficient and effective network of Growth Hubs across England*” \[S5\]. 

 One month later, in reference to the enduring impact of the research\-led design and delivery of the W2GH Programme as a model for delivery of economic policy outlined in the 2013 Budget, a former Deputy Prime Minister said, “ *The Local Enterprise Partnerships are designed to bring back some of the local entrepreneurial wealth creating preoccupation...I would put my money on the men and women who actually spend their lives and are wholly committed to the success of that local economy… what this university is helping the government to do, which is the creation of growth hubs*” \[S6\]. 

 In the Autumn Statement 2015, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy \(BEIS, formerly BIS\) secured a further GBP24 million to build Growth Hubs in every Local Enterprise Partnership \(LEP\) area. BEIS committed a further GBP14 million of funding to LEPs through Growth Deals between 2015 and 2016 to establish Growth Hubs throughout England \[S7\]. The W2GH Programme was included in the 2015 BIS Best Practice Policy Case Studies in the Open Policy Making category \[S8\]. 

 In May 2016, the Minister of State for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise announced that the planned Growth Hub network was complete, with 39 Growth Hubs operating across England and supporting 4.7 million businesses. She stated, “ *Growth Hubs have already helped thousands of businesses and, with the full network up and running, every registered business in England can access the expertise they need to succeed. They will help entrepreneurs boost their business and create more jobs for people in the local area*” \[S9\]. 

 In the 2017 Industrial Strategy, the government announced its intention to ensure all businesses in every region would continue to have access to a Growth Hub as part of its approach to increase the diffusion of best practices \[S10\]. Connecting this policy with LUMS research, the Assistant Director of the Growth Hub Division of BEIS confirmed that the W2GH Programme provided the model for building locally embedded business support in every region of England \[S3\]. 

 Since 2018, following the expansion of the network \(and the merger of 2 LEPs in 2017, creating a single Growth Hub for that area\), the now 38 Growth Hubs engaged with 2.55 million businesses; delivered >226,154 business interventions; attracted >1.95 million visitors to websites; supported 11,245 individuals in starting a business. It also brokered 6,494 businesses into mentoring programmes, 13,764 businesses towards sources of funding, 11,293 businesses into skills/management programmes, and 3,621 businesses into innovation/R&D programmes \[S3\]. This expansion was directly informed by original research in entrepreneurial eco\-system development by Pugh, Soetanto, Jack and Hamilton \[R6\], which developed an ‘integrated learning model’ for delivering impactful programmes to small businesses. This research built an understanding of how universities enhance regional and national economic growth, and that understanding was translated into the latest phase of the Growth Hub rollout. With W2GH and the subsequent expansion, the legacy of the impact of this research is embedded in each interaction that a local business in England has had with a Growth Hub since September 2013.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Silver Shoppers project has enhanced UK and Chinese retailers’ understanding of addressing older customers’ unmet needs in the supermarket environment. Through social design research, industry engagement and exhibitions, Silver Shoppers has challenged attitudes to the everyday problems faced by older people in the UK and China when shopping in supermarkets. It has produced new products to improve the shopping experience for the older generation, such as an augmented trolley, and has drawn attention to non\-inclusive characteristics of supermarket layout, signage and shelf design. The project brought together researchers, older people, retailers, charities, students, design professionals and consumers in co\-design activities. It raised awareness among these participants, and the wider public, of everyday challenges faced by older people, and the opportunities to redesign the shopping experience.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 By 2050, the world's population aged over 60 is expected to reach 2 billion, up from 900 million in 2015, according to the World Health Organisation. Given this demographic shift, older people represent an increasingly valuable target market for retailers, none more so than supermarkets, which have expanded significantly in recent years as smaller local shops, traditionally favoured by older consumers, have closed. Ethnographic research led by Dr Yuanyuan Yin starting in the UK context 2010, has sought to understand the challenges that older people face in the supermarket environment across the different cultural contexts of the UK and China. She has used these findings to co\-develop design innovations to improve the shopping experience for older people in both countries. 

 The research began its comparison of the UK and Chinese contexts in 2012 with an initial investigation into the difficulties experienced by older supermarket customers in the UK. Several challenges for older people were identified: understanding where certain products were located; accessing products on high or low shelves; poor signage and labelling; and inappropriate portion sizes. Dr Yin and her team concluded that supermarkets could learn from research into new ways of applying digital support and ergonomic design within the shopping process and environment \[ **3.1**\]. 

 This led into a broader ESRC\-funded project, *Silver Shoppers*, the first systematic study of the shopping experience for older people at a national level in the UK and China. Led by the University of Southampton, collaborators included Tsinghua and Brunel Universities, Sainsbury’s – who participated in focus groups and facilitated in\-store observations – and Age UK, who supported the recruitment of study participants. In\-depth focus groups involving 22 people aged 68\-97 were conducted in two UK locations to investigate the factors that influence older customers’ shopping experiences. Researchers designed an ethnographic user study that used ‘cultural probes’, an experimental technique to gather information for design inspiration, to analyse the shopping experiences of 30 British and Chinese older customers for six weeks in Somerset, Shropshire and Berwick\-upon\-Tweed in the UK, and Shandong, Sichuan and Jiangsu in China. Participants completed shopping evaluations and diary entries, and researchers carried out video\-based observations and interviews. Participants felt supermarkets were not designed to meet their needs and were geared more towards families. They often found it difficult to locate products, blaming inadequate signage and changeable store layouts. They struggled with heavy baskets, deep trolleys that were hard to manoeuvre, and high and low shelving with stock pushed towards the back. Many were reluctant to ask staff for help and some of those interviewed proposed the idea of ‘slow’ checkout lanes, highlighting the importance of having opportunities for in\-store social interaction to address feelings of loneliness. The findings were shared with store managers in the UK and China \[ **3.2**\] and published as an open\-access dataset on ReShare, the UK Data Service’s repository \[ **3.3**\]. 

 These findings inspired and guided a social design programme ‘Design for Ageing’ in which staff and students at Southampton, Tsinghua and Brunel co\-developed ideas for new products and services, based on inclusive design principles, that could improve the supermarket environment for older people. Twenty\-four concepts and prototypes were developed, including: an iTrolley which is smaller, easier to manoeuvre than the standard trolley and which guides customers around the store, allowing them to scan items via a shopping app on the attached iPad \(Fig. 1\); a ‘follow me’ robot basket; and an in\-store ‘shopping café’\(Fig.2\), where people can choose items via a touchscreen pad while socialising \[ **3.4**\].  The prototypes were exhibited at the 2017 London Design Festival \[ **3.5**\]. From these products, Yin pursued a commercialisation plan to improve the original iTrolley design and develop a new product named Smart Trolley \(Fig.3\), which is more stable, cheaper, allows customers to carry their shopping bags in it, and has a more developed version of the app to support in\-store navigation \[ **3.6**\]. The ESRC study led onto a joint paper with Brunel and the University of Liverpool that introduced the concept of psychosocially inclusive design, within the context of supermarket shopping for older people. It looks beyond issues around physical access to consider four necessary psychosocial constructs – cognitive, emotional, social and value, which encourages designers to balance older peoples physical and psychosocial needs in inclusive product design \[ **3.7**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This research has produced two main benefits a\) collaborative activities with the public and key stakeholders that address the everyday challenges that older people face, and b\) changing UK and Chinese retailers’ understanding of older customers’ unmet needs in the supermarket environment through inclusive design. Through the co\-design of innovative products and services aimed at improving older people’s shopping experience, the Silver Shoppers research project has engaged the retail industry, design professionals, age\-related charities and consumers across generational divides to address inclusive design for everyday challenges. Having registered the iTrolley design \(Fig.1\) with the UK Intellectual Property Office in 2018, Yin partnered with design consultancy Burrell Innovation to further research and develop a new product prototype named Smart Trolley \(Fig. 3\) and an updated shopping assistant app that incorporates ‘smart’ features into the trolley, such as in\-store navigation via an on\-board tablet. This process involved usability tests with older people, which were conducted in situ at a Sainsbury’s store, working alongside the store’s manager. 

 **Public debates and collaborative activities** 

 The Silver Shoppers initiative has increased public awareness of the often\-unseen challenges facing older people in supermarkets while allowing groups of older people to develop a shared appreciation of the difficulties they face. The first public exhibition *Design for Ageing*, at Winchester School of Art on August 20\-23, 2013, was covered by ITV News Meridian, with an audience of 310,000 \[ **5.1**\]. It screened the videoed shopping observations and allowed younger people to experience an older person’s perspective on the shopping process, by wearing glasses to simulate impaired vision and weights and elastic bands on their hands to mimic stiff joints. Speaking to ITV about the exhibition, a representative of charity Age Concern said: “ *Anything that simulates getting old, and what it’s like to be older, how it restricts your movement, maybe your eyesight, vision, how to pick things up, has to be a good thing. It raises awareness of what older people have to go through every day in their normal lives*.” 

 The *Retail Futures* exhibition in 2017 attracted an international audience, including representatives from big retail companies such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s, design companies, design and branding strategists, ageing related organisations, design students, and families with young children. It was part of the London Design Festival, a globally significant annual event that reported an audience of nearly 420,000 in 2017, and was covered by China’s Xinhua News Agency, reaching an audience of up to 272,544 \[ **5.2**\]. Presenting the ESRC\-funded study findings, the exhibition featured video documentaries of older shoppers in the UK and China, 24 product design and service ideas developed by academics and students from Southampton, Brunel and Tsinghua, shopping simulations and a giant post\-it note board, where people wrote thoughts and ideas. As an indication of the exhibition’s impact on visitors’ awareness and understanding of what older people experience, sample comments  included: *“Using the ageing equipment helps \(you\) understand how you feel as \(an\) older person”; “Really detailed and thorough research – particularly enjoyed simulating an old person dealing with the grocery shopping at \(the\) supermarket”; “Well done on this great piece of research. As a brand strategist, I often talk about age being a mindset, but your interactive experience has made me realise the very real physical realities brands have to care for”.* \[ **5.3**\] 

 This feedback also showed recognition of the value of addressing older people’s unmet needs through such projects. Comments included: *“As a frequent customer of supermarkets and as a senior citizen, I am happy to see that research is being done to improve the supermarket experience for seniors”; “Very inspiring to see a study that focus\(es\) on the elderly generation. One generation that is usually excluded”; “Excellent\!\! I’d like to apply this methodology to \(the\) Japanese market\!”.* \[ **5.3**\] 

 Through the user studies, focus groups and questionnaires, the research team engaged 303 people aged 65\-plus in the UK and 366 in China. The collective process of reflecting on shared challenges and the act of bringing older people together in community settings was viewed as a positive and constructive experience by many participants. For example, one participant \(female, from Alnwick, UK\): “ *taking part in the user study has raised awareness for me. It has been an experience from a new point of view, looking differently at the shopping I have been doing. I think the design findings of this project are particularly useful*.” \[ **5.4**\] 

 Focus groups and iTrolley usability studies involving older people recruited by Methodist Homes for the Aged \(MHA\), the largest charity care provider for older people in the UK, revealed this age group’s enthusiasm for new technological approaches. Comments from participants in the July 2019 test include: *“Yes, I think it \[the iTrolley\] is useful … I am sure people would \[use it\]”; “I like the design of the trolley which is not too low \[or\] too high, \[it\] is a good size”; “I am impressed … particularly the iPad on it, that is very straightforward to use”.* \[ **5.8**\] 

 A feedback visit with participants from Nanjing, China in July 2018 revealed that older shoppers who participated in the study continued to benefit from the experience. Participants explained that participation in the user study has made them think more about shopping and supermarket design for older people: *“after this project, I can easily find issues in a store. Some products were positioned on a high shelf and I could not reach them. So I went to their staff and let them know. The staff apologised and realized that design was not convenient to older people.” * Several expressed appreciation that the project aimed to improve older people’s quality of life, and an interest in taking part in future studies. \[ **5.4**\] 

 **Inclusive Design: Changing UK and Chinese retailers’ understanding** 

 Dr Yin shared research findings at different stages of the study at eight meetings with Sainsbury’s and held focus groups with supermarket store managers in the UK \(April 2014\) and community supermarkets in China \(March 2015\). These discussions strengthened retailers’ understanding of the limitations of existing supermarkets in both contexts in meeting older consumers’ needs. The meetings with Sainsbury’s demonstrated design innovations that could help supermarkets connect with their older customer base. During a meeting to gather feedback on design ideas, one Sainsbury’s manager said of the iTrolley: *“Great simple concept, no need to bend down would be a real advantage for many customers. I love this – will be very helpful for customers who struggle to reach the bottom of a normal deep trolley.”* \[ **5.9**\] A Sainsbury’s store manager who engaged with the project since 2013 commented: “ *When I joined in this store as the store manager, we knew the store is high trading intensity, a terrible place to shop because of its size, old flooring, town centre shop, no investment, there were many problems. So, it was very interesting to be involved in the project back to 2013, to change the store and \[explore\] how to make it more suitable to the ageing population…I think the project inspired me to improve my store...We look at the average age of the local area and found many older customers. My colleagues also engaged in improving the store, during that time and we trialed the plastic long handle shopping basket*.”\[ **5.5**\] 

 In China, the manager of a community supermarket, Zhaolan Yuan, in Beijing, who attended a focus group in 2015, later reported in July 2019 that the study findings had prompted him to act. He explained that as a result of participating in the Silver Shoppers project he better understood older Chinese customer’s needs *“We improved our store environment based on the suggestions, such as reducing the top shelf height. They were 1.8m but now are 1.6m…* *after that change, the store space looked much better as well. Customers can have their first glance through the store and make things more visible.”* \[ **5.6**\] Yin has continued to present the study findings to supermarket executives and to policymakers in China. In October 2019 she presented her results to the policymakers on the SciTech Committee of China Silver Industry Association. The Director commented that “The Silver Shopper Project Report has significant practical value, and meaningful impacts on policymaking to guide silver industry development in China. The research outcomes supported us to better understand older Chinese customers’ shopping habit and needs.”\[ **5.10**\] Following a separate presentation in October 2019 to Suning Commerce Group, one of the largest non\-government retailers in China, the general manager for the Beijing area said: *“I think your research outputs do help us a lot… In our next business plan, we will think about how to provide a better service to older customers. The shopping issues identified from your research are the issues we need to deal with in our near future. Based on your research findings, we will select some of your findings that can be applied into our store, such as to change its layout plan and signages in the store”.* \[ **5.7**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Andrew Maunder’s research into early twentieth\-century theatre recovers forgotten plays and authors, introducing modern audiences to the lively theatrical industry of the wartime years: a largely unknown dimension of cultural life on the WWI Home Front and after. Through performances and community partnerships taking place between 2015 and 2019, audiences and participants were enabled to think well beyond the ‘war poets’ and to reappraise their understanding of the wartime cultural landscape and its legacies. The different productions have reached audiences amounting to 2,600 people across 68 performances and c.9,500 via online streaming; a further 250\+ school\-aged students have explored and experienced the plays’ themes through workshops and their own production; an estimated 20,000 further visitors engaged with the research through a touring exhibition. A *BBC Online* article discussing the rediscovery of one of the plays reached over 1.9 million readers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Andrew Maunder began researching First World War theatre in 2010. He was General Editor for the five\-volume anthology *British Literature of World War I* \(Pickering and Chatto, 2011\) \[ **3.1**\], which made available rare short stories, novels and plays from 1914–19, and looked beyond the iconic WWI texts and authors in the popular canon \(Owen, Sassoon, Kipling et al.\). Alongside hundreds of unpublished plays held in the Lord Chamberlain’s Collection in the British Library, Maunder also came across neglected works by familiar names such as Barrie, Shaw and Galsworthy, some of which had not been staged since the war. These included the one\-act spiritualist play *A Well\-Remembered Voice* by J.M. Barrie \(1918\), which explored the death of a young soldier, dealing sympathetically with an aspect of war\-time life which gets overlooked: the craze for spiritualism and attempts to contact the dead. 

 Subsequent research into post\-war theatre recovered further lost plays. Maunder’s edited collection *British Theatre and the Great War* \(Palgrave, 2015\) \[ **3.2**\] offered revisionist analysis of what war\-time audiences were offered \(including revivals of plays which never mentioned the war at all\). Research into suburban war\-time theatres revealed references to continuing productions of Lieutenant St John Ervine’s 1913 play about an unhappy marriage, *Jane Clegg*. Written at the height of the campaign for votes for women, the play’s plot about an unfaithful husband who embezzles his firm’s money and his wife’s decision to finally end their marriage seemed unusual war\-time fare but was clearly popular at the time. 

 Maunder discovered references to Robert Graves’s previously unstaged *But It Still Goes On* \(1929\) while writing a GCSE guide to R.C. Sherriff’s *Journey’s End* \(Methuen / Bloomsbury 2016\) \[ **3.3**\]. Graves’s play had been commissioned by the producers of *Journey’s End* who wanted a follow\-up hit, but the play was rejected partly on account of its frank discussion of homosexual desire amongst soldiers. 

 Because this body of work constituted such a rich source for understanding how the conflict and its challenges were represented, the next logical step was to investigate how today’s audiences would respond to them in their intended context: in performance on stage, and in doing so re\-appraise their understanding of the war\-time and early\-twentieth century culture. 

 In 2015, Maunder advertised for a director with a good track record in period drama, raised production funds and co\-ordinated the production of Barrie’s *A Well\-Remembered Voice* \(1918\) \[ **3.6**\]. A prototype production was performed at an event organised by the AHRC Everyday Lives in War, First World War Engagement Centre at the University of Hertfordshire \(June 2015\). Positive feedback prompted Maunder to explore means of gaining wider audiences for the play. In 2016 he teamed up with Orleans Gallery, Richmond in a £20,000 project ‘After Tipperary’ through the AHRC\-funded FWW Centre. The project a\) partnered with local volunteers and schools to research war\-time entertainment in the borough 1914\-1919, disseminating their findings in a range of formats; and b\) co\-ordinated a small touring production of *A Well\-Remembered Voice* for local secondary schools, in particular students studying GCSE drama. In October 2016 it had 2 performances at Twickenham Academy before going on tour including London’s Leicester Square Theatre. 

 Following these projects, Maunder developed the commercial staging of two further rediscovered plays, each allocated four\-week runs at London’s award\-winning Finborough Theatre. The Finborough is necessarily selective in its programming: “Space is given only to a small number of projects for plays that are genuinely striking, that have something different to say, but which also can be developed commercially with a modern audience in mind.” Noting that *But It Still Goes On* \(1929\) had never been staged – and that its explosive mood of bitterness and anger was in interesting contrast to Sherriff’s restrained play which has dominated the canon of WWI drama – Maunder approached the Finborough who agreed to stage it in 2018 as part of their ‘Great War 100’ series. Maunder acted as producer, recruiting directors and technical teams and overseeing rehearsals and production \[ **3.7**\]. 

 Based on this collaboration with Maunder and the interest generated by the Graves play, the Finborough were happy to work with him again as producer on a production of *Jane Clegg* in 2019 \[ **3.8**\], noting that “the play’s focus on female empowerment also meant that it could make a distinctive contribution to the renewed interest in 2018 in the suffragette movement”.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) \[1556\] 

 The main beneficiaries of this research are: 

1.  Audiences who watched the plays. They have been moved, made to feel uncomfortable or amused and have encountered voices of WW1 rarely found elsewhere which have challenged them to reappraise their understanding of the war, its culture and legacies. 

1.  Community Knowledge of the Past: communities have discovered and engaged with material which takes them beyond familiar narratives of WW1. 

1.  Creative industries and cultural educators in London, Surrey and Middlesex. They have used the research to reach a range of audiences and have been made aware of the potential for productive collaboration with universities. 

 **Public Engagement and reaching new audiences:** Box\-office returns show c.2,500 theatregoers have paid to see the plays *A Well\-Remembered Voice*, *But It Still Goes On* and *Jane Clegg* \[ **5.1**; **5.2**\]. These productions took place in established venues \(Finborough; Leicester Square Theatre\); *A* *Well\-Remembered Voice* was also performed at a school to an audience of 100 local students from a variety of schools, not all of whom would have had the opportunity to attend live theatre otherwise, including those who needed to write about a performance for their GCSE studies – thus enhancing their cultural participation. 65% of pupils surveyed said they thought the production was thought\-provoking; 85% that they would go to something like it again; 76% thought it was important that it was happening at that moment \[ **5.1**\] 

 A film of the stage production of *Jane Clegg* was made available on YouTube from June\-August 2020 as part of the Finborough for Free season. It was a *Times,* *Guardian* and *Waitrose Magazine* recommendation and gained c.9,500 views. \[ **5.3**\]. The film was also a finalist for an ‘Off West End’ award for best pre\-pandemic recording with minimal editing. The productions were covered in local and national press and media including *The Times, The Stage, Time Out, Daily Telegraph, BBC Online, Jewish Chronicle* and local radio, and were extensively reviewed, particularly *But It Still Goes on* and *Jane Clegg. Jane Clegg* was reviewed in the *Guardian* by Michael Billington \(‘Forgotten suffrage era gem shines again,’\) and a *BBC Online* article featuring Maunder discussing the play and its rediscovery reached over 1.9m readers \[ **5.4**; **5.5**\]. 

 For audiences the ‘lost’ war plays demonstrated an alternative to familiar post\-war representations such as *Journey’s End* \(1927\) and *Oh What a Lovely War\!* \(1963\). The Finborough Artistic Director reports of *But It Still Goes On* that “there was definitely a section of \[the audiences\] who were interested in its war themes. Another section recognised it as a ground\-breaking example of twentieth century theatre’s treatment of homosexuality and, to quote one of the critics, its ‘providing glimpses into things that would not be fully explored on stage for another forty years’” \[ **5.2**\]. Statements from audience members after *A Well\-Remembered Voice* demonstrate this shift in understanding about WW1 entertainment: 

-  “Different to what I expected \(in a good way\).…I came with my 13 year old son – a great performance enjoyed by us both” 

-  “Not what I was expecting – was expecting something more blatantly anti\-war.” 

-  “…exceptionally interesting because it presented a different perspective on death, the afterlife and love.” \[ **5.6**\] 

 The production of *Jane Clegg* “brought a different audience \[to the Finborough\], many of whom were interested in the feminist dimension to the play” \[ **5.2**\]. Audience comments noted its historical and contemporary engagement, a reminder of how our female ancestors had few choices: 

-  “the feminist themes \[still\] stood out…extraordinarily. The impact of Jane having power \(money\) and the furious reactions of those around her were like a microcosm.” 

-  “the determined wife absolutely hard, but pitiable as she had no way out of the situation but to endure it…” 

-  “as contemporary as \#Metoo” \[ **5.7**\] 

 Critics rated *Jane Clegg* highly \(3\* *The Guardian,* 4\* *ActDrop*, 3\* *The Stage, 5\* The Upcoming, 5\* London Pub Theatres Magazine*\) and praised its rediscovery and contemporary relevance: 

 “Thankfully Herts academic Andrew Maunder recently rediscovered Ervine’s 1913 controversial gem, *Jane Clegg*…. after sitting enthralled by this pertinent and timely melodrama, I can’t understand why this has been overlooked for so long” \( *Stage Review,* 2 May 2019\) \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **Community knowledge of the past:** *After Tipperary* was a 2016 research partnership between Maunder, Orleans Gallery and local history volunteers \(a total of 318 project participants\). It investigated an unusually rich diet of entertainment in Richmond and Twickenham in 1914\-1919, and worked to change understanding about everyday life on the Home Front. Although volunteers had already known a good deal about the war, some were surprised by the variety of material offered to war\-time residents, and by “the amount of effort went to by \[local\] residents to entertain troops and injured soldiers”. They also “commented on how the research had made them think about the lives of working\-class people during the war….much of their prior knowledge related to middle class experiences”. A Heritage Assistant stated it “was exciting to be able to cover areas…that have previously taken a bit of a ‘back seat’. Sharing this information has added to our understanding of people who lived locally at the time.” \[ **5.1**\] 

 With the volunteers, Maunder and Orleans Gallery’s Project Co\-ordinator co\-wrote a short illustrated history, *After Tipperary: Theatrical Entertainment during the First World War in Richmond upon Thames* \(2016\) which was given away free of charge in museums and libraries in the borough. The research material also formed the basis of an exhibition held at Richmond Theatre and then Richmond Adult Community College \(November 2016\) before touring local libraries \(to 13 January 2017\), reaching an estimated audience of 20,000 \[ **5.1**\]. 

 Sharing the collaborative research helped enrich school\-level education and challenge pupils’ understanding about the First World War. Dramatic Edge, a Richmond Council initiative aiming to raise the standard of drama and dance across schools, took some of the most striking local stories uncovered by Maunder and the team to create a new play set in WW1 for junior and middle school students to perform. Through workshop, the stories were combined with different performance styles – silent film, music hall, melodrama, song and dance – and shaped into a coherent piece. The final production took place at Twickenham Academy on 10 November 2016 and showcased the talents of 70 children with four professional actors, before an audience of 220 parents and pupils. The children involved “loved that they got to work with professionals. It made them feel special.” The emphasis on the Home Front rather than the trenches – on the social and cultural rather than exclusively the military – meant that “ **the young people who took part in the Dramatic Edge workshops** **showed a clear difference in how they think about the First World War after taking part**.” \[ **5.1**\] The success of this approach – learning about history through performance – led to Orleans House Gallery providing immersive workshops for primary schools \(180 children and 20 teachers\), which centred upon the role of entertainment to fundraise for local causes during the First World War. Copies of the KS2 Teachers’ Pack based on the community research were sent to all 150 primary schools in Richmond and Hounslow, and were made available on the Orleans House Gallery website. 

 An independent evaluation concluded *After Tipperary* was: “a successful project that engaged residents in Richmond with the everyday experiences of people during the First World War and made strong connections between academia, the cultural sector, formal and informal learning and researchers. *… **The knowledge of all participants was increased as a result of taking part, \[making\] them better able to understand culture and everyday life during the First World War**…*\[it\] enabled participants to better explore the impact of the conflict by using theatrical entertainment as a lens.” \[ **5.1**\] The Director of the National Lottery Heritage Fund First World War Centenary Programme – identifying ways in which their funded projects had influenced public understanding of the war and its impacts – stated **“the specialism of Everyday Lives in War in theatre studies was central to the success of Orleans Gallery in Richmond’s project** \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **Creative industries and cultural educators:** These projects have demonstrated the potential for mutually beneficial collaboration between universities, their researchers, the commercial theatre and theatre practitioners, providing models for future collaboration: 

-  The *After Tipperary* partnership between the University of Hertfordshire and Orleans House Gallery was evaluated as “ **strong and effective in widening participation and ensuring knowledge transfer**,” with the “pivotal roles” of both the Project Manager and Andrew Maunder highlighted in its success \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  The Artistic Director of the Finborough Theatre stated: “The productions of *But It Still Goes On* and *Jane Clegg* are examples of how small productions at a fringe theatre of stage\-worthy rediscovered texts, carefully planned, with expertise and ambition behind them, can help **change the theatrical landscape** \- particularly as regards the First World War…..On a broader level, there is clearly an ongoing challenge in taking period\-based subject matter and presenting it to twenty\-first century audiences; the fact that this has been achieved suggests that there is a possible model for other organisations to follow.” \[ **5.2**\] 

-  David Gilmore, Olivier\-award winning director of *Jane Clegg,* stated “The opportunity to stage St John Ervine’s ‘Jane Clegg’ was **one of those events that so rarely come along. It was a chance to tackle a fine piece of work by a writer whose oeuvre could otherwise so easily slip into oblivion**. Like all the best drama it resonates with today’s audiences a century after it was written and was received with great approbation.” \[ **5.9**\]

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Whilst an ageing population is seen as a global phenomenon, in China this population is rising more rapidly than in many other countries. As a consequence, demand for health care has increased, and delivering a good\-quality service is a challenge for providers. Research from the University of Reading on an integrated clinical pathway management approach and a digital platform has been used by over 1,000 major public hospitals \(over 400 Grade A hospitals\) and 1,400 suburban hospitals, covering 31 provinces and 200 cities in China. Informing the decision\-making of over 1,500,000 doctors, the integrated pathway management approach has improved the quality of hospital service and increased capacity, with reduced medical error, reduced patient waiting time, shorter hospital stays, and fewer unnecessary tests. The successful adoption of this research also led to the growth of the Chinese company, Sinldo Information Technology \(Beijing\) Co. Ltd, where Li is the Scientific Advisor and which is now listed on a Chinese Stock Exchange. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 In addition to China's large \(1,400,000,000\) and ageing population, shortages in critical health and care workers have compounded the demand for health care, in a country where major hospitals can have over 4,000 beds, with outpatient volumes of 4,000,000 patients per year. Within this context, research at the University of Reading has addressed how the quality, efficiency and safety of hospital services can be significantly improved through the effective use of information, data and clinical pathway knowledge. Prior to this, there was limited research on integrating best\-practice clinical pathways with local hospital practices and existing technical information systems. Although digital systems are increasingly used in hospitals, they form information silos; thus, their effectiveness has been limited, owing to a lack of alignment with clinical pathways. By developing an integrated clinical pathway platform, the research has addressed the lack of connection between best practice clinical pathways, local hospital practices and existing hospital information systems. 

 Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC\), this research first developed a theoretical underpinning and a co\-designed research methodology for integrated pathway management by drawing on organisational semiotics. Led by Li \(Ref 1\), the integrated clinical pathway management approach was piloted by working closely with key hospital staff in selected hospitals \(Hospitals 301 and 309, China\), including the hospital’s Director of Information. It built on research understanding and encoding the complex clinical pathway knowledge into a knowledge\-based management system \(Ref 2\). The first pilot in Hospital 301 was with 70 staff participants; the second pilot, funded by the hospital R&D fund, was implemented in Hospital 309 and a total of 342 patient pathways were analysed. The findings since the second pilot \(in 2014\) show that the integrated clinical pathway management approach and the digital platform can significantly reduce medical errors, costs and waiting times \(Ref 1\). 

 The introduction of the co\-designed integrated pathway management approach through agent technology differentiates this work from other clinical decision systems; it generates a personalised patient support pathway, whereby best\-practice clinical pathways are integrated with existing hospital processes and information systems. Further work on the integrated digital platform has incorporated cloud and mobile technology for wider adoption \(Ref 3\). Having received funding from Sinldo Information Technology, ESRC, and NSFC, the innovative approach is now enabling further collaborative research, with data generated from the integrated hospital data platforms informing medical science and the pharmaceutical industry on differing medication patterns for different patient groups \(Ref 4\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Improving hospital practices and patient experience 

 Responding to the challenge of rapidly increasing health\-care demand in China, research at the University of Reading has underpinned a major change in hospital practice across the country. In addition to improving clinical outcomes, it has brought significant benefit to the quality of the patient experience prior to, during and after a hospital visit. Through the development of a digital integrated clinical pathway management approach, and a digital platform linked to existing hospital information systems, the research has enabled up\-to\-date clinical pathway knowledge and healthcare data to be readily accessible through mobile technology by the patient, clinician and hospital management. In so doing, it has considerably improved hospital service capacity, and reduced medical error, patient waiting time, length of hospital stay, and unnecessary tests. At the same time, it has increased patient surgery and patient referrals. The integrated clinical pathway approach has also been responsible for improved diagnoses, resulting in the saving of lives \[sources 5 to 7\]. 

 Through successful pilots in collaboration with Chinese hospitals, the novel approach was developed and demonstrated by the Reading team. On the basis of this approach, and informatic tools derived from the research, the Sinldo Information Technology company was set up, with Li acting as the Scientific Advisor \(see below\). By 2018, research at Reading had underpinned the delivery of bespoke digital platforms and integrated clinical pathway management systems across 2,400 hospitals in China \[source 1\]; this includes 1,000 major public hospitals \(over 400 Grade A hospitals\) and 1,400 suburban hospitals, covering 31 provinces and 200 cities in China \[source 4\]. In summary, the research outcome has been translated into products and services including the following: 

1.  A digital platform 

-  a knowledge\-based platform to facilitate decision making based on best\-practice clinical pathways, integrated with existing hospital systems 

-  front\-end applications for doctor workstations \(providing integrated information on patient pathway activities, treatment progression and patient condition\), and nurse workstations \(providing integrated information on care activities and patient condition every day along the pathway\) 

-  patient applications \(integrating hospital service information along a patient’s journey\). 

1.  A consulting tool to map best\-practice clinical pathways to local hospital processes \(outpatient and inpatient processes, and doctors’ working processes\) with the support of the digital platform. 

 The research has enabled better utilisation of health\-care resources and improved service quality, despite the dramatically increasing demand for health care. It supports 1,500,000 doctors and helps 600,000,000 outpatients and 25,000,000 inpatients each year by enabling the right information to be available at the right time on the clinical pathway. Moreover, it supports hospital services for 480,000,000 patients with hypertension, 350,000,000 patients with cardiovascular disease, 270,000,000 patients with diabetes and 120,000,000 patients with cancer \[source 9\] every year. 

 According to statistics from 100 major hospitals that applied this research, it has on average reduced medical error by 30% \(from an average of 252 adverse events and prescribing errors on six disease pathways during six months before implementation to 168 adverse events and prescribing errors after implementation\), and reduced waiting times by 50%, patient record and treatment data accessing times by 90%, and admission/discharge/referral times by 85%, with a total reduction of average length of stay from 12 days to 10 days \[source 6\]. Specifically, 23 hospitals were assessed for detailed impact \(31 pieces of evidence collected\). 

 For example, Wuhan Central Hospital adopted the mobile health application for integrated care service in September 2014. By December 2015, 98% of patients felt the process had been improved; there was a 55–83% reduction in medical errors; a 27% reduction in unnecessary tests and an 80% reduction in waiting times. The average time for patient record updating \(including in ICU\) was reduced by 24.4 hours. Due to the significant reduction in waiting time, the overall outpatient time was reduced from 260 to 170 minutes, while the average inpatient stay was reduced by 176.8 hours \[source 6 and ref 4\]. 

 A further example is that of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University, which adopted a hospital\-wide information integration platform in 2015. This has significantly improved the hospital’s service capacity: completed outpatient cases increased by 62%, completed inpatient cases increased by 49%, completed surgery cases increased by 99%, outpatient cost reduced by 9% and patient referrals increased by 40% \[source 6\]. This has benefited patients by improving their experience of hospital \(through reduced waiting times and fewer medical errors\), benefited doctors by providing them with more efficient workplaces, benefited hospital chief executives by giving them an improved overview of performance supported by an integrated data platform, and benefited hospitals by improving their use of resources and the quality of the service they offer. 

 Professor Xijing He, the former dean of the hospital, confirms that “the integrated clinical pathway platform enabled seamless access to various systems linking to doctors’ mobile applications, where they can get the most up\-to\-date information at the point of care. Furthermore, with the best practice clinical pathway knowledge incorporated in the digital platform, doctors will be warned of abnormal values \(in patient test results\) … for timely interventions, which ensures patient safety and service quality” \[source 6\]. 

##  Adoption and commercialisation of the research 

 As a result of the Reading team’s research, a system was developed with Sinldo which embraced the integrated clinical pathway management approach. In order to maximise care provision, it bridged the gap between healthcare best practices and the patient journey. Through Li’s continued engagement with these hospitals, she was instrumental in demonstrating more broadly to the Chinese health\-care sector the added value of the informatics tools developed. She also successfully pitched the potential of these artificial\-intelligence\-based systems to investors \[source 1\]. The number of employees in the company grew from 89 in 2014 to 171 in 2017, and it has received four rounds of financing/investment \(attracting GBP14,568,598 in total\) since 2013 \[sources 2–4\]. In April 2017, Sinldo was listed on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations \(NEEQ\) stock market \[source 2\]. It was recognised as China’s first digital health company listed on that market since China’s national strategy of “Internet \+ Health” was introduced in 2015. This has also given Sinldo a means to make an eventual transition to being listed on the main stock exchanges in the future and competing with larger firms. 

 Hongqiao Yang, Chairman of Sinldo Information Technology \(Beijing\) Co. Ltd. confirms that “Sinldo became a leading technology company providing a data integration platform and Weizi \[Li\] has been playing a key role in research and development before and after Sinldo’s establishment. The successful pilots of her research outcome led to the start of the company and she has been working continuously with the company team and hospital staff to develop applications in different hospitals. Weizi’s research has brought inspiration and innovation in our products and our partnership development with hospitals and investors.” \(source 1\) 

 This research from the University of Reading, which was a winner in the 2018 ESRC Excellence in Impact Awards \[source 8\], has made a highly significant contribution to addressing the challenge of providing high\-quality health care to the whole of the Chinese population, considered to be the fastest\-growing elderly population globally. Through the design, implementation and subsequent commercialisation of appropriate informatics technology, it has improved patient health outcomes through increased efficiency and efficacy of hospital service delivery, reaching 600 million outpatients and 25 million inpatients each year. Critical to this has been the encoding of the complex clinical pathway information into a knowledge\-based management system. For the Chinese nation, this has been highly significant, with both social and economic benefits in terms of increased efficiency and improved health outcomes. For individuals, it has meant not just a decrease in inconvenience \(for example, through shorter waiting times, referral times and length of hospital stay\), but for many patients, it has provided more fundamental benefits, such as reduced medical errors, with lifesaving ramifications.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Southampton \(UoS\) has developed a successful therapy for virus\-induced inflammatory lung conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \(COPD\) and COVID\-19. UoS’s pioneering use of inhaled interferon beta \(INF\-β\) in the early 2000s led to the spin\-out of **Synairgen**, which since August 2013 has raised more than GBP129m to fund clinical trials, has grown its market capitalisation tenfold to GBP300m and has received GBP10m through licensing. It has improved patient outcomes, clinical practice and wealth creation: 

-  A successful phase II trial of INF\-β in **asthma** led to a 2014 licence deal with Astrazeneca with milestones worth up to USD225m. 

-  GBP4m was raised for a 2018 phase II clinical trial in **COPD**, boosting patients’ antiviral lung defence and leading to a further GBP2.9m investment. 

-  In a 2020 phase II clinical trial in patients with **COVID\-19**, IFN\-β treatment lowered patients’ risk of developing severe disease by 72% and doubled the likelihood of recovery. The led to a global GBP30m phase III trial, international media attention and an immediate fivefold growth in Synairgen’s share price. 

-  Effective recruitment for the trials was enabled using a rapid point of care \( **POC**\) test for viral infection developed by UoS, which reduced COVID diagnosis time from 21.3 hours to 1.7 hours. The POC testing model has contributed to Public Health England guidance and is in the process of being rolled out to all acute trusts across the country. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The University of Southampton has been at the forefront of respiratory disease research for the past 30 years, discovering many of the key mechanisms using *in vivo* studies and *ex vivo* lung tissue, and pioneering stratification methods to provide a better understanding of diseases, such as asthma and COPD. This long\-standing respiratory disease expertise enabled Southampton’s scientific community rapidly to respond to the COVID\-19 pandemic with positive results for patients and industry. 

 Through controlled infection of human volunteers, research led by Professor Stephen Holgate published in 2000 \[ **3.1**\] found the airway epithelium plays a pivotal role in acting as a ""host"" for common cold viruses, and that rhinovirus infections of the lower respiratory tract are directly linked with asthma exacerbations. This stimulated the discovery by Professor Donna Davies and her team of a deficiency in the production of anti\-viral interferons by bronchial epithelial cells grown from asthmatic donors \[ **3.2**\]. Crucially, the cells could be protected against virus infection by adding exogenous interferon beta \(IFN\-β\), a breakthrough in the search for therapy. This led to the formation of the spin\-out company, Synairgen in 2003. 

 In 2010\-2012 a phase II trial led by Professor Ratko Djukanovic studied the effect of nebulised IFN\-β on worsening of asthma symptoms caused by viral infections.  Asthmatics treated with IFN\-β within 24 hours of developing symptoms of upper respiratory viral infection exhibited recovery of lung function decline induced by the infection/exacerbation, resulting in reduced need for additional treatment when compared to placebo. This demonstrated that asthmatics with severe asthma benefited most in terms of preventing symptom deterioration. Furthermore, the study provided vital evidence for the mechanisms of action based on biomarkers quantified in blood and induced sputum \[ **3.3**\]. 

 This led to a larger phase II trial \(INEXAS\) in 2015\-2016, led by AstraZeneca, which was halted “because of difficulty in determining primary endpoint as there were very low numbers of severe exacerbations overall”. Nonetheless, subsequent analysis of the INEXAS trial data showed a significant benefit from IFN\-β in those difficult\-to\-treat patients who were virus\-positive. After careful reflection and further negotiations, AstraZeneca returned the programme to Synairgen to develop further. 

 The effectiveness of IFN\-β as a therapeutic for **COPD** was investigated in 2017 by Professor Tom Wilkinson, who showed that epithelial senescence prevented apoptosis of virally infected cells and that IFN\-β was protective against infection \[ **3.4**\]. He also showed that corticosteroids given to COPD patients both daily and \(at high systemic doses\) during infectious exacerbations impair IFN\-β mediated anti\-viral immunity. The asthma trials and this additional research led to Synairgen assessing IFN\-β as a potential therapeutic for COPD. 

 To facilitate the subsequent phase II clinical trial of IFN\-β in patients with COPD, patients were recruited using a rapid point of care \( **POC**\) test for viral infection pioneered by Dr Tristan Clark, significantly reducing the number of subjects required for the trial. The POC test is a syndromic test carried out in a sample\-to\-answer platform where a swab taken from a patient’s nose is analysed and results given in 1.7 hours. A randomised control trial \(ResPOC, 2015\-2016\), which involved more than 700 patients with acute respiratory illness, including pneumonia and exacerbations of asthma and COPD, demonstrated that the POC test resulted in shorter courses of antibiotics and hospital stays \[ **3.5**\]. 

 At the very early stages of the **COVID\-19** pandemic in January 2020, the Southampton team’s research efforts turned to the SARS\-CoV\-2 virus, which had evolved mechanisms to suppress IFN\-β production, allowing it to evade the innate immune system. Synairgen pivoted from the COPD trial to test the hypothesis that IFN\-β may reduce the morbidity associated with inflammation resulting from SARS\-CoV\-2 infection. In February 2020, Wilkinson rapidly set up a phase II clinical trial to test IFN\-β on patients with COVID\-19. The team received key support from the Urgent Public Health \(UPH\) panel as a priority trial for Clinical Research Network sites to support. The trial completed in May and showed that IFN\-β treatment resulted in a 72% lower risk of developing severe disease compared to placebo and that patients were more than twice as likely to recover from COVID\-19 as those on placebo during treatment \[ **3.6**\]. 

 Led by Professor Nick Francis, the trial was expanded in May to include 120 patients based in a community setting.  Discussions began in autumn 2020 with Operation Warp Speed \(OWS\), a public–private partnership initiated by the U.S. government to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID\-19 vaccines; IFN\-β was selected as one of the arms in the ACTIV\-2 trial and first patients were enrolled in January 2021.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton \(UoS\) over the past 30 years has led directly to the development of nebulised IFN\-β as a new, successful therapy for inflammatory lung conditions such as asthma and COPD. This therapy has had tangible impacts on patient health and wealth creation, culminating in a successful clinical trial during the COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 **Formation of Synairgen** \(covered in REF 2014\) 

 Synairgen was founded in June 2003 by Holgate, Davies and Djukanovic, with investment from IP2IPO Group plc \(now IP Group\). It was floated on the Alternative Investment Market \(AIM\) in October 2004, raising GBP10,500,000. \[ **5.1**\] 

 In March 2004, UoS filed a patent for the use of inhaled IFN\-β for treatment of virus\-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD. This allowed the pioneering research to continue through clinical trials testing IFN\-β for asthma and COPD. \[ **5.1**\] 

 From 2008 Synairgen concentrated its effort on the clinical development of inhaled IFN\-β for the treatment of exacerbations of asthma and COPD caused by respiratory viruses. In 2009 Synairgen completed Phase I trials in moderately asthmatic subjects and progressed to Phase II proof of concept studies. Underlining significant investor confidence, the company raised GBP6,000,000 in 2009 to fund phase II clinical trials in asthma and GBP2,500,000 in 2011 to accelerate completion of asthma phase II, conduct various in vitro experiments and fund avian flu research. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Synairgen’s market capitalisation was GBP26,307,751 at the end of 31 July 2013. \[ **5.1**\] 

 **Continued success of Synairgen and nebulised IFN\-β for treatment of asthma** 

 Since August 2013, Synairgen has increased the number of staff employed on its drug development from 15 to 19 and aided the career of staff including 9 scientists, 3 nurses and 7 trial managers, either employed directly or indirectly by the company. Its market capitalisation was GBP305,869,035 at when markets closed on 31 December 2020. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Southampton’s phase II trial of nebulised IFN\-β in asthma led to a global license deal between Synairgen and AstraZeneca in 2014, with an upfront payment of USD7,250,000 \(06\-2014\) and potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to USD225,000,000 as well as tiered royalties, a proportion of which goes to the University. \[ **5.2**\] 

 **Nebulised IFN\-β for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \(COPD\)** 

 In December 2017, Synairgen changed its strategic direction to assess IFN\-β as a potential therapy for COPD. A phase II Clinical Trial of IFN\-β in patients with COPD was launched in February 2018 by Wilkinson and raised GBP4,000,000. The first part of the trial was successful, showing that IFN\-β boosts antiviral lung defense mechanisms in the absence of a respiratory virus. This led Synairgen to raise GBP2,900,000 in September 2018 to expand the trial from 80 to 120 patients with a confirmed respiratory viral infection. By February 2020 recruitment was almost completed when the COVID\-19 outbreak started to gain momentum in the UK. \[ **5.1**\] 

 **Nebulised IFN\-β for the treatment of COVID\-19** 

 Synairgen raised GBP5,000,000 for the University’s phase II clinical trial to test IFN\-β on patients with COVID\-19, which got Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) and ethics approval within days and was established within four weeks, an unprecedented timeframe for a trial. It involved nine other hospital sites within the UK, recruiting 101 patients, and the first part of the trial was completed within seven weeks. Following the success of the first stage, £3m was raised to expand the trial in May 2020 to include an additional 120 patients in the community setting. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Results released in July 2020, showed that patients who received IFN\-β had a 72% lower risk of developing severe COVID\-19 compared to placebo and were more than twice as likely to recover from the disease as those on placebo. It also showed breathlessness was markedly reduced. There were no deaths among the patients who received IFN\-β, demonstrating its huge “ *potential as an inhaled drug to be able to restore the lung’s immune response, enhancing protection, accelerating recovery and countering the impact of SARS\-CoV\-2 virus.”* \[ **5.3**\] 

 The phase II trial and subsequent results had a substantial impact on Synairgen’s share price. Within the first 48 hours of the trial launching on 18 March 2020, Synairgen’s share price doubled from GBP0.24 to GBP0.49. Upon release of the positive results in July, the share price soared as much as 552%, taking its year\-to\-date gain to about 3,194%. \[ **5.4**\]. 

 The launch of each stage of the trial, as well as the announcement of the results, attracted worldwide media attention. Coverage in July 2020 of the first results was across broadcast, radio, print and online platforms including outlets such as The Guardian, New York Times, The Brussels Times, CNN, BBC Radio 4 and Bloomberg \[ **5.5**\]. 

 These positive results led to Synairgen’s inhaled IFN\-β being selected for the US Government funded ACTIV\-2 trial \(estimated value GBP100m\) \[ **5.6**\] which evaluates treating patients with mild to moderate COVID\-19 symptoms not yet requiring hospitalisation. Additionally, Synairgen has commenced an in\-patient global Phase III trial launched in December 2020 \[ **5.7**\], funded through a GBP87,000,000 placement on the London Stock Exchange and led by Wilkinson. This international trial will recruit up to 610 patients and continue to evaluate IFN\-β as a treatment of hospitalised COVID\-19 patients, aimed at preventing the need for ventilation, and accelerating recovery. 

 Synairgen’s Investigational New Drug application to the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) to evaluate IFN\-β as a treatment for patients with COVID\-19 was approved in December 2020, enabling Synairgen to initiate the Phase III trial in the US \[ **5.7**\]. The FDA awarded it Fast Track status, enhancing the ability of Synairgen to interact with the FDA and shortening review timelines \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **Rapid point of care \(POC\) test for viral infection** 

 The development of the POC test for respiratory infections underpinned the success of the trials for both COPD and COVID\-19 by providing quicker patient diagnosis, leading to more effective recruitment. Patients who received a positive POC test for COVID\-19 were recruited into the trial two days earlier than patients who were tested by the lab. This successful POC testing strategy has led to further trials, which have had an impact in the clinical setting. 

 The ResPOC study led to an NIHR post\-doctoral fellowship for Clark in 2016 to carry out a randomised control trial to assess the POC test for patients with influenza symptoms. Patients who received the POC test were given antiviral treatment on average 28 hours more quickly than those who did not have the test. Patients who had influenza diagnosed by the POC test were also isolated more appropriately and rapidly \[ **5.9**\]. 

 Southampton’s POC test research underpinned and was cited in Public Health England guidance, published in November 2018 and updated in October 2019, describing the benefits of implementing POC testing in hospital settings. Southampton was described as an Early Adopter \(EA\) site where “successful outcomes reported by EA groups include improved patient triage, better cohorting and use of isolation rooms during periods of winter pressure.” \[ **5.10**\] 

 During Synairgen’s COVID\-19 trial, the POC test had positive impacts on waiting times for COVID\-19 results and patient flow through Southampton General Hospital. A clinical impact assessment trial of POC testing during the first wave of the pandemic showed that instead of taking a day to receive results, clinical staff received results in just 1.7 hours on average. Patients who received the test were transferred to the appropriate ward within eight hours, compared to 28 hours for those who did not. Additionally, patients in the emergency department who received the POC test were not transferred to an assessment area unnecessarily. This resulted in fewer bed moves, reducing the need for deep cleaning and staff exposure to COVID\-19 in contaminated areas. \[ **5.11**\] 

 Due to Southampton’s ground\-breaking work with the POC test, Clark was asked to contribute to the Academy of Medical Sciences’ *Preparing for Winter* report, which gave a ‘reasonable worst case scenario’ of between 24,500 and 251,000 virus related deaths in hospital, peaking in January and February 2021. This report and the successful results of the POC test in Southampton led to Clark being seconded to the Department of Health & Social Care to assist in the national roll out of POC tests to all acute trusts. \[ **5.12**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Lameness is the most important animal welfare issue for farmed ruminants across the world, with digital dermatitis \(DD\) the most common infectious cause.  DD is a bacterial infection which produces severe foot lesions in infected animals causing substantial suffering and significant economic loss. DD affects 1,200,000 dairy cattle and 1,100,000 sheep annually in the UK alone, costing an estimated GBP80,700,000 per year. Control is challenging, with no vaccines, and disease management has substantially relied on inappropriate large scale antibiotic use. 

 University of Liverpool research into DD aetiology, epidemiology and control in multiple species has led to a commercial PCR diagnostic test and significant changes in national and international veterinary and livestock industry policies and practice for DD control. We have developed evidence\-based treatment and prevention protocols that reduce reliance on antibiotics and encourage their responsible use. These protocols have changed the professional practice of 70% of sheep vets and 52% of sheep farmers and 45% of dairy industry professionals working across 3,800 farms and 658,320 cattle.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Digital dermatitis \(DD\) is a severe, common infectious bacterial foot disease of ruminant animals affecting livestock farming industries worldwide. The disease is very painful, generating substantial welfare issues, and has significant economic consequences. Since emerging in dairy cattle in 1974, DD has spread globally, crossing multiple species barriers. Treatment and control of DD are difficult, and many practices have been criticised for irresponsible antibiotic use. 

 The University of Liverpool \(UoL\) DD group has been the major team internationally leading research into ruminant DD \(>50 papers since 2008\) and the principal research group studying DD in sheep. Our group was the first to identify, routinely culture and isolate treponeme bacteria as the causal microbes of DD \(3.1\). This was a major step forward in DD research. Using our novel isolation methods, we have been able to identify a new pathogenic bacterial species \( *Treponema pedis\),* establish a polytreponemal aetiology for the disease \(3.1\), develop an *in vitro* antimicrobial susceptibility testing method \(3.2\), characterise the clinical and pathogenic features of the bacteria \(3.1, 3.3\) and undertake fundamental epidemiology studies \(3.4\). This underpinning research has enabled the group to develop evidenced\-based treatment and preventative intervention studies \(3.5, 3.6\) which have resulted in substantial changes in industry and veterinary policy and practice in DD control. 

##  Research on Diagnosis of DD in all Species 

-  We developed novel PCR diagnostics for DD treponemes \(2009\) which are now the basis for diagnostic testing for the disease \(3.1\). 

-  We developed the first published sheep DD lesion scoring system which are used by farmers and vets nationally and international for disease diagnosis \(2015\). 

-  These clinical and PCR diagnostics allowed us to detect and track the continued emergence of the disease \(2009\-2020\) in new host breeds and species \(beef cattle, sheep, goats and wild elk\) and in new countries \(Ireland, Germany, Sweden, USA\) \(3.3\). 

##  Research on Responsible Antibiotic and non\-Antibiotic Therapies for DD in Sheep 

-  Previous DD interventions have intensively employed antibiotics, raising concerns regarding antibiotic stewardship in DD control. Our development of a novel *in vitro* antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for DD treponemes \(2009\) led to the identification of the most effective antibiotics and disinfectants and enabled evidenced based treatment and prevention protocols for DD infections \(3.2\). Large\-scale randomised controlled trials \(RCT\) \(32 farms/9,000 sheep between 2012\-2016\) have demonstrated the benefit of treating sheep with targeted, non\-critically important, antimicrobials which are now recommended as first line treatments for sheep \(3.5\). Data from our RCT studies also provided strong evidence against whole flock prophylactic antibiotic treatments, and this damaging practice has subsequently been discouraged by the sheep industry and the veterinary profession \(3.6\). No vaccine is currently available for DD and in one study we identified significant benefits of vaccinating sheep with a repurposed vaccine \(Footvax MSD\) for DD control \(3.5\). There has been wide uptake of our advice on the use of this vaccine for DD control in sheep, both by farmers and vets. 

##  Research on Farm Management and Biosecurity for DD Control in Sheep 

-  Since its emergence in UK sheep in 1997, our epidemiology has shown the rapid spread of DD in the UK \(affecting 35\-50% of UK flocks in 2014\) and identified farm and animal level risk factors that drive infection \(2015\-16\) \(3.4\). These studies have changed national farm management disease control advice and biosecurity policies. 

##  Research on Biosecurity Practices for Cattle Farms 

-  Using the culture and diagnostic methods we developed \(3.1, 3.2\), we demonstrated that DD treponemes could be transmitted on hoof trimming knives and gloves \(2014\-2017\). Together with our *in vitro* disinfection efficacy assay methodology this has led to the creation of published evidenced based biosecurity and disinfection protocols to prevent disease spread between and within farms \(2018\-2020\) \(5.3, 5.10\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Digital dermatitis \(DD\) is a severe, common, infectious, bacterial foot disease of ruminant animals causing substantial animal welfare issues and economic consequences in livestock production. This disease is prolific and has emerged in countries worldwide with the UK alone having 1,200,000 dairy cattle and 1,100,000 sheep infected annually, costing an estimated GBP80,700,000 per year. 

 University of Liverpool research into DD aetiology, epidemiology and control, across multiple species, has resulted in a commercial diagnostic test and evidence\-based treatment and prevention protocols that enable both reduced and responsible antibiotic use. Our research has resulted in significant changes in national and international veterinary and livestock industry policies and practice to control DD. 

 The research group has ensured their outputs on diagnosis and management of DD have reached all levels of livestock industries by working with industry organizations and veterinary professional bodies to deliver a substantial knowledge exchange programme. This included 45 farmer and veterinarian meetings, 4 webinars, 23 national and international conference presentations, annual programmes of undergraduate and postgraduate veterinary education lectures, 12 publications in farming and veterinary press, 51 peer reviewed publications and 2 public websites aimed at directly communicating research results to the veterinary profession and farming industry \(5.1\). 

 The impact of the work on DD is broad, in terms of reach and significance. The direct beneficiaries are farmers, veterinary practitioners, industry policy makers, foot trimmers and diagnostic laboratories. The impacts are change in knowledge, understanding, policy and practice on the diagnosis and management of DD and have shifted the industries towards more responsible use of antibiotics in food producing animals, a wider societal benefit. In our recent surveys, 52% of sheep farmers and 70% of vets and 45% of dairy industry professionals have indicated they have changed their professional practices directly as a result of the UoL research \(5.2, 5.3\). 

###  Improvement in Veterinary and Farming Industry Practice: Diagnosis of DD. 

-  Based on the pathogens we identified as causal of DD, and the PCR tests we developed, diagnostic tests for DD are now included in diagnostic lab portfolios around the world, including the UK \(Axiom\) and New Zealand \(Gribbles Veterinary\) with 444 tests per year completed in the UK alone enabling appropriate treatment and control \(5.4\). 

-  Our lesion scoring system, which details diagnostic criteria for DD in sheep, has been incorporated into the Sheep Veterinary Society Good Practice Guidelines for Lameness in sheep \(5.5\) and national UK sheep industry guidance on diagnosis \(AHDB Manual on Lameness in Sheep\) \(5.6\). In our impact survey, 73% of veterinarians considered their knowledge and ability to diagnose DD had improved as a result of UoL research work, and 97% of UK sheep farmers were now aware of the disease \(5.2\). 

-  Internationally, our clinical and laboratory diagnostics work has informed the first diagnosis of DD in sheep in Ireland, Sweden and Germany \(5.7\). 

-  Our group was first to identify the ability of DD pathogens to cross host species including diagnosing DD in UK goats and wild elk in the USA \(5.7\). The identification of a wildlife reservoir for DD has serious implications for control and informed US government control strategies. A government website available to the public describes UoL work identifying the disease cause and provides advice for disease control and public health implications with 56,566 views since 2014. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife \(WDFW\) reports: “UoL research implicating treponemes as causal agents for elk hoof disease increased our fundamental understanding of the disease, and directly informed WDFW management policies and outreach…\[This\] has allowed us to enact regulations to minimize disease spread…\[and\] allay concerns for human health from contacting diseased material/consuming meat….\[and\] communicate the causes and management challenges to elected officials, other US state wildlife management personnel, the veterinary community, hunters, wildlife advocates, and public” \(5.7\). 

###  Veterinary and Farming Industry Policy and Practice: Improved Management of DD 

-  **Responsible Antibiotic and non\-Antibiotic Therapies for DD in Sheep.** The severity of DD infections previously led vets to treat whole sheep flocks with prophylactic, highest priority, critically important antibiotics for human health. This practice is contrary to WHO and UK Government positions on antibiotic use in farming. Our research demonstrated the efficacy of a lower priority antibiotic \(3.2, 3.5\), and the efficacy of a repurposed commercially available vaccine \(Footvax, MSD\) \(3.5\); reciprocally we provided strong field evidence against the use of prophylactic antibiotics for control of DD in sheep \(3.6\). 

 These research findings led to new guidelines on treatment and prevention of DD in sheep which were quickly incorporated into Sheep Veterinary Society \(SVS\) Policy on Responsible Antibiotic Use \(5.4\), National Guidance on Responsible Antibiotic use by the Farming Industry \(Sheep Health and Welfare Group\) \(5.8\) in 2016. Since then, the veterinary profession and farming industry have rapidly and substantially changed practice with respect to antibiotic use in treatment of DD in sheep. Our 2020 Impact Survey \(5.2\) found that as a direct result of UoL research, 73% of vets and 51% of farmers have now changed their antibiotic selection, 45% have changed practice on whole flock antibiotic treatments, whilst 58% of vets and 34% of farmers have increased their use of the re\-purposed vaccine \(Footvax MSD\) \(5.2\). Furthermore, sales of the repurposed vaccine Footvax \(MSD\) during this period have also increased by 16% \(5.9\). 

 Testimony from the National Sheep Association \(5.6\) state that our research has “significantly increased the fundamental knowledge of CODD in terms of its causes, diagnosis and treatment, whilst promoting further good practice with regards to responsible antibiotic use in our sector”; the SVS \(5.5\) state that we have “improved practices within the veterinary profession, concerning DD, by increasing awareness of the disease amongst vets and farmers, improving diagnosis and providing evidenced based treatment and control strategies for the profession to utilise”. 

-  **Biosecurity practices on sheep farms** designed to prevent DD disease transmission between and within sheep flocks have also been enhanced because of our research. In 2015, our epidemiological research identified key farm management and biosecurity practices as important risk factors for DD in sheep flocks. These findings were incorporated into the SVS Good Practice Guidelines on Lameness in Sheep \(5.5\) and the Sheep Industry Manual on Lameness in sheep \(5.6\). Following these changes, and considerable additional knowledge exchange activity, we conducted an impact survey of farmers and veterinarians. Seventy percent of vets considered that this revised guidance improved farm management advice to reduce DD transmission; 63% of vets changed biosecurity advice to farmers as a direct consequence of UoL research; 46% of farmers have up taken this biosecurity advice \(5.2\). 

-  **Biosecurity practices on cattle farms.** The research group developed evidence\-based disinfection protocols for DD in cattle in 2019 which have now been adopted as policy by the national UK dairy industry \(5.10\). The protocols were based on our identification of foot trimming equipment and user gloves as infection reservoirs for the DD pathogens, and *in vitro* and field\-based studies on disinfectant efficacy \(2014\-2019; detailed within 5.3\). 

 An international dairy industry survey in 2020 demonstrated the impact of UoL research on awareness and hygiene practices \(5.3\). Respondents were based in the UK \(56%\), Europe \(25%\), USA and Canada \(18%\). 44% of dairy professionals on 3,800 farms \(managing 658,320 cows a year\) considered they were now more aware of the risk of spreading DD during foot trimming and 45% of respondents had enhanced their hygiene practices in line with UoL disinfection protocols in the last year with 5.6% already considering they are already observing less DD in their cattle as a result \(5.3\). 

 In summary, the research at the University of Liverpool on DD in livestock has led to improved diagnostic tools; provided an evidence base for treatment, with a focus on reduced and responsible antibiotic use; and the creation of farm biosecurity and hygiene practices to prevent disease transmission. These practices have been quickly and widely taken up by the farming and veterinary industries for animal welfare, antibiotic stewardship, and economic benefits.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at the Whittle Laboratory at the Department of Engineering and at Loughborough University led to a new design for the ducts \(‘S\-ducts’\) that link compressors in an aeroengine, improving engine efficiency and reducing emissions. Rolls\-Royce incorporated the new design into the Trent XWB generation of engines, which were first delivered in 2014. The new S\-duct provides fuel efficiency improvements of 0.25%. In 2019 alone this is estimated to have delivered fuel cost savings of USD19,200,000 for airlines. Rolls\-Royce has delivered over 919 engines with the new S\-duct design since 2014, and in 2020 there are 370 Airbus A350 aircraft in\-service with the S\-duct design.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research described below was developed in the EU FP6 project *Aggressive Intermediate Duct Aerodynamics for Competitive and Environmentally Friendly Jet Engines.* The University of Cambridge, Loughborough University and Rolls\-Royce were partners in the project and collaborated on a new engine duct design. 

 In a modern civil aero engine, the intermediate\- and high\-pressure compressors are joined by S\-shaped annular ducts. The Cambridge and Loughborough teams researched different aspects of the S\-duct to improve engine performance, and it was the combination of the distinct underpinning research at each institution which allowed a new S\-duct design to be developed. Cambridge research focussed on making the duct profile more aggressive, allowing a larger radius change or a shorter length, and Loughborough research focused on integration of the upstream blade row into the duct, also shortening the duct. 

 The starting point for the research at the Whittle Laboratory at the Department of Engineering was Miller’s and Hodson’s realisation in 2003 that, by developing an understanding of the aerodynamic failure mechanisms within strutted S\-ducts, ducts with a larger radius change, shorter length, or with a thicker strut could be designed. Initially, the design space for S\-ducts was explored. Computational fluid dynamics was used to explore the limits of the design space, with the limit cases then tested experimentally using large\-scale aerodynamic test rigs. It was shown that a duct could be designed with a 24% larger radius change compared to the ducts used in engines at the time. These findings were published in \[R1\]. 

 The research in \[R1\] was extended to more representative cases using a test facility with two independently powered compressor stages, one upstream and one downstream of the duct. This allowed the performance of ducts to be measured as the operating points of both stages are altered. This research demonstrated that the duct designed in \[R1\] could successfully operate in engine\-representative environments \[R2\]. 

 Building on \[R1, R2\], a new design method for 3D non\-axisymmetric profiled ducts was developed \[R3\]. By allowing the duct walls to be designed non\-axisymmetrically, the local diffusion imposed by the struts within the duct could be cancelled using curvature on the end walls. A numerical optimiser was used to optimise the profiled duct walls, which building on the earlier research now demonstrated that a 48% greater radius change for the same length was possible. The performance of the computationally optimised design was validated using a two\-stage compressor duct test facility \[R3\]. The difference between the original ducts, and the final profiles developed through the research, is shown in Fig. 1. The final duct profile shows a cleaner flow, and reduced losses. 

 The 3D non\-axisymmetric profiled technology is protected by a patent granted in November 2007 \[R4\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 A new S\-Duct design, made possible by the research, was incorporated into the Rolls\-Royce Trent XWB engine and provides fuel efficiency and emission reduction benefits over the previous generation S\-Duct design \[E1\]. The first Trent XWB engine was delivered in 2014 \[E2, p.15\], and the Trent XWB has been Rolls\-Royce’s best\-selling large civil aero engine by volume in each year since 2017 \[E2, p.15\]. The Trent XWB is marketed by Rolls\-Royce as the “ *the world's most efficient large aero engine*”, with fuel use cut by 15% compared to the original Trent engine and delivering fuels savings of USD2,900,000 per aircraft per year \[E3\]. It was selected by Airbus as the exclusive power unit for the Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, which entered service in 2015. Fuel accounts for approximately a quarter of airline operating costs, making engine efficiency a critical factor in the commercial success of an aeroengine. 

 **New S\-duct design** 

 The new duct design introduced two changes that improved engine efficiency. In previous generation engines the radius of the intermediate pressure compressor, upstream of the S\-duct, dropped across its rear stages making its performance non\-optimal. In the Trent XWB engine the intermediate pressure compressor was maintained at its optimal radius across all stages, increasing its efficiency. This was achieved by the new S\-duct having a larger radius change over the S\-ducts in previous engines. The second performance improvement was due to the length of the new S\-duct being reduced by 60mm, reducing overall engine weight and length. The Cambridge research allowed final S\-duct design to have an increased radius change and a reduced length. The Loughborough research allowed a further reduction in length. Without the combination of the two technologies the new development of the new S\-duct would not have been possible. 

 **Engine deliveries and operation** 

 The Trent XWB\-84 engine was first delivered in 2014, and the more powerful XWB\-97 was first delivered in 2017 \[E2, p15\]. From 2014 to the end of 2019 Rolls Royce delivered 846 Trent XWB engines to customers. As of December 2019, 660 XWB engines were in service and a further 1,133 engines were on order \[E2, p14\]. The Trent XWB accounted for 46% of all Rolls\-Royce large civil aero engines deliveries in 2019 and 57% of all orders at the end of 2019 \[E2\]. The Trent XWB powers all Airbus A350 aircraft \[E2, p14\], with 370 A350 aircraft delivered to operators since 2014 and up to 31 July 2020 \[E4\]. As of 31 July 2020, the A350 is operated by 36 airlines; the airlines operating the most A350 aircraft as of July 2020 are Qatar Airways \(49\), Singapore Airlines \(48\) and Cathay Pacific \(36\) \[E4\]. 

 **Fuel cost savings due to the S\-duct design** 

 The new S\-duct design, an integration of the Cambridge and Loughborough research developments, reduces specific fuel consumption by 0.25% \[E1\]. Improved compressor performance accounts for a 0.15% fuel saving and the reduction in duct length accounts for a 0.1% fuel saving \[E1\]. Analysis by the Oliver Wyman consultancy of the US widebody fleet in 2019 reported that widebody aircraft operated 13.0 hours per day on average, and typical fuel costs for a large widebody aircraft were USD4,500 per hour \[E5\]. Based on 4,745 flying hours per year \(13 hours per day\) and fuel costs of USD4,500 per hour, a fuel efficiency improvement of 0.25% due to the s\-duct technology equates to a fuel cost saving of USD53,300 per aircraft per year, and a saving of USD19,200,000 per year across 370 in\-service A350 aircraft \[E4\]. The Trent XWB powered Airbus A350 was rated in 2017 as the most fuel\-efficient aircraft used on transatlantic routes \[E6, p.9\]. The efficiency of the Trent XWB engine has contributed to Singapore Airlines operating scheduled Singapore to New York flights, the world’s longest by distance, which commenced in October 2018 \[E7\]. Fuel efficiency is a key differentiator in the competitive aeroengine market and the new S\-duct design contributes to the efficiency of the XWB engines and to Airbus selecting the XWB engine as the exclusive power unit for the A350. 

 “*The Trent XWB engine is the world’s most efficiency aeroengine. In a highly competitive market focussed on fuel efficiency, the levels of improvement offered by the S shaped duct technology represent a key competitive advantage, and can make all the difference in winning a contract.  The Trent XWB has been the fastest\-selling widebody engine ever, with over 919 delivered as of 30 June 2020*. *”*

 Oxford Physics’ key role in the ATLAS collaboration and its search for the Higgs boson led to the development of the citizen science project Higgs Hunters.  This two\-stage project involved searches for new particles by citizen scientists, and subsequent analysis by UK school students. The citizen science project reached 42,280 participants from over 170 countries. As a result of participation, over 80% of survey respondents reported improved physics knowledge, and 47% were more likely to go on to study physics. In the project’s second stage, UK school student researchers from differing backgrounds created and performed their own research projects, and presented them in conferences in Oxford and at CERN. They reported developing a wide range of improved skills, knowledge and engagement.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Large Hadron Collider at CERN is the most powerful particle accelerator in the world. It reproduces the conditions that existed in the first moments after the Big Bang. Particle collisions are observed in the LHC using large and complex detectors, one of the biggest of which is ATLAS. **\[1\]** Oxford Physics is one of the leading institutes in the large international ATLAS collaboration. Oxford physicists have major roles including in triggering interesting interactions of the protons, known as “events”, reconstruction of these events and studies of backgrounds that can fake real events in the detector. ATLAS is positioned at one of the four points around the LHC at which protons interact, and detects charged particles emanating from the interactions with the “central tracking detector” that contains Semiconductor Tracker barrels that were assembled at Oxford. These are surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, which measure the energy of all impinging particles and which are themselves surrounded by detectors sensitive to muons. Within the central tracking detector, the paths of charged particles are bent by the solenoidal field from a superconducting magnet, while a separate system of magnets provides a toroidal field within the muon detector. The curvature of the charged particles in the magnetic field is inversely proportional to their momentum. The LHC provides 20 million proton\-proton bunch crossings per second, far more than can be recorded by ATLAS. To reduce the data volume, trigger algorithms select up to several hundred events per second that contain interesting features such as muons, electrons or high\-energy jets of particles **\[2\].** 

 The ATLAS collaboration searched for the Higgs boson, which is predicted to be responsible for the mass of the elementary quarks and leptons. This scalar \(i.e. spin quantum number 0\) particle was predicted by the Standard Model fifty years previously but was only observed in 2012. **\[3,4\]** The Oxford group led the discovery of the Higgs boson in decays to W\-boson and tau\-lepton pairs, observed its decays to tau\-leptons and b\-quarks, and also led searches for Higgs boson decays to muons and to possible invisible particles that might form the Dark Matter observed in the Universe. Some physics theories under test at the LHC also predict the existence of so\-far unobserved particles not included in the Standard Model of particle physics that describes all current data. In such theories, an additional scalar particle mixes weakly with the Standard Model Higgs boson, leading to additional Higgs decays into new particles dubbed ‘baby Higgs bosons’. These have a slow decay rate, typically of order nanoseconds, and hence a relatively long lifetime compared to other “Standard Model” particles of a similar mass. **\[5\]** They can therefore travel for tens of centimetres from the proton\-proton interaction point at which they are produced. Their decay is detected by the Semiconductor Tracker as sprays of tracks that originate far away from the interaction point. Such features can be particularly challenging for computer algorithms to reconstruct and are often better identified by the human eye.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  Background of “Higgs Hunters” online and extension to schools project 

 The ATLAS collaboration’s search for the Higgs boson is arguably one of the most high\-profile scientific efforts of our time, yet at the outset of the Higgs Hunters project in late 2014 there was no way to involve a curious public directly. CERN’s popular LHC@home scheme allowed non\-specialist users only passive involvement by donating their spare computer resources, while actual participation in research required highly specialised levels of coding experience via CERN’s Open Data portal or the Kaggle platform, which ran three machine learning challenges in 2014/15 attracting modest numbers of participants \(700\-1900\). 

 The “Higgs Hunters” project was launched in November 2014 by the Oxford ATLAS group \(PI: Alan Barr\) in collaboration with the citizen science platform Zooniverse \(who provided the back\-end and user interface on which the project ran\). The University of Birmingham’s public\-engagement specialists were consulted in developing and testing the project. Citizen scientists \(CSs\) were tasked to look for evidence of the Higgs boson decaying to ‘baby Higgs bosons’ \(as described in **\[5\]**\). The project was targeted at existing users of the Zooniverse, and promoted in the media to reach a wider audience. The new particles were expected to produce off\-centre tracks in the Semiconductor Tracker barrel detector which are particularly challenging for image\-processing software to identify but which can be easily spotted by the human eye. The discovery of a new particle unknown to science would be transformational to the field, which provided good motivation for CSs and was highlighted in media promotion. CSs were asked to classify a selection of both real and simulated data \(produced in collaboration with ATLAS colleagues at NYU\) for calibration, from events that were pre\-selected as likely to contain a Higgs boson \(first by the ATLAS trigger algorithm **\[2\]**, and then based on previous studies which had revealed appropriate selection criteria **\[3,4\]**\). The data were collected from April – December during the 2012 data\-taking period, when the LHC was producing proton\-proton collisions at around 8TeV. 

 “Higgs Hunters” on the Zooniverse platform was followed with a schools phase of the project, run in partnership with IRIS \(the Institute of Research in Schools\). This allowed Key Stage 4 and 5 students the opportunity to analyse the effectiveness of the citizen scientists’ classification and to perform their own searches. Selected students later presented their findings at conferences held at the Oxford Physics department and at CERN. 

###  Impact on “Higgs Hunters” participants online 

 In the first phase of the project, more than 38,000 participants from over 179 countries classified 1,500,000 interesting features on 39,000 distinct images \(each classified by 20 different CSs before retirement\) **\[A\]**. This puts Higgs Hunters in the top 2% of projects by number of participants across the entire Zooniverse \(which itself is the world’s biggest citizen science platform\), where to date it is the only particle physics project. Most participants classified a handful of images, with 1,000 classifying over 100, 100 classifying over 1,000, and one individual classifying over 25,000. All registered “Higgs Hunters” participants \(28% of total registered\+unregistered participants in Higgs Hunters at the time\) were invited by email to complete an online survey in June 2016, with 322 responses **\[B\]**. The survey showed that respondents were 33% female and 65% male \(with 2% “other”\) and represented ages from 16 to 75\+, and occupations including students, teachers, engineers, consultants, developers, researchers and retired persons.  The best\-represented countries in the survey were the USA \(25%\) and the UK \(16%\), with a total of 35 countries represented among all respondents. These reported an increased engagement with science, with over 80% responding that their knowledge of particle physics had been improved as a direct result of participation in Higgs Hunters, while 47% indicated that they were more likely to go on to study physics as a result of participation. Many had discussed the project with family \(58%\) and friends \(65%\), 87% reported having gone on to read or watch more about science, 29% to study science more formally and 15\-20% had attended lectures, science fairs and/or visited museums as a result of their engagement with the project. 97% of the survey respondents indicated that they would like to take part in a future Zooniverse project on CERN physics. An analysis was also performed on the 20,257 comments received between November 2014 and May 2017 from 1,345 users on the “Higgs Hunters” Talk forum **\[A\]**. The analysis showed that the citizen scientists had formed a community with their own technical language and experts, where analysis of words used on the discussion board which accompanied the project showed an increase in use of advanced technical language, demonstrating deep engagement with the science. 

###  Impact on high school pupils 

 The second, schools, phase of the project was run in collaboration with the Institute for Research in Schools \(IRIS\) and allowed school students the opportunity to work through the citizen scientists’ classifications of data. The schools phase of the project launched in September 2016. The project was one of eight that IRIS ran in its first year.  The students worked with large data files, containing information about the clicks of hundreds of thousands of Zooniverse users. From this, they conceived and then generated their own investigations, choosing an aspect to investigate, producing results and an analysis of the results. To support the students, a detailed “Higgs Hunters” brochure was produced to accompany the data, which presented the concepts in an appealing and accessible way and included links to the UK curriculum. In total, 105 schools downloaded the data from IRIS and 45 schools accessed the supporting resources **\[C\].** An explanatory webinar aimed at teachers \(who watched from 28 schools\) and a video covering the launch event have a combined viewing of over 500 views on YouTube **\[D\]**. Of all the schools that took part in the project, 70% were in the state sector **\[**IRIS email 8 July 2020 **D1\]**. Despite the challenging nature of the project, 51 pupils from 19 schools showed sustained engagement throughout the process \[IRIS email 10 Sept 2020, **D2\]**.  17 pieces of student work were produced, with contributions both from individual student researchers and from student teams; these projects were then submitted to the IRIS Library, where they are accessible to other schools in the IRIS network as inspiration. Examples of analysis methods included use of advanced computer coding, machine\-learning and pattern\-recognition techniques, demonstrating deep engagement with the project. The Physics teacher at Camden School for Girls \(where 6 pupils participated\) comments “ *The whole process has given the students the confidence to talk about Physics beyond the textbook. And for me, as a teacher, it’s meant that I’ve got back in touch with real research and what’s going on. It’s been inspirational.*” **\[D3\]** 

 The student researchers were invited to submit their results as posters. In summer 2018, the 20 student researchers with the best submissions were invited to present their research at a two\-day “Higgs Hunters” Conference, held in the Oxford Physics department. The 4 female and 10 male students who were able to attend were from a range of school types \(4 from a comprehensive, 9 from academies and 1 from an independent school\), while 6 out of 14 came from schools in ‘social mobility coldspots’ and 8 out of 14 were from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds **\[E\].** The students wrote up their work, producing Conference Proceedings **\[F\]** that, following internal review by the ATLAS collaboration at CERN, were the first of their kind to be accepted as an ATLAS Notes publication. The students, who were interviewed by phone after the conference, stated that the opportunity to conduct original research had: increased their physics subject knowledge; helped inform/confirm future choices of study; increased awareness and enjoyment of research; increased understanding of the difference between school physics and research physics; developed a wide range of practical and presentation skills; and developed their confidence and resilience **\[C\]**. Nine of the students went on to present their research to ATLAS collaborators in September 2019 in a poster session at CERN; a video made for the event has over 7,000 views **\[G\].** One of the students commented: “ *what I was able to fully appreciate at CERN for the first time, was how people from different races, upbringings, and backgrounds, had come together after two world wars and went to extreme lengths to build the world’s largest Physics experiment to try and answer these questions. This extended my feeling from last year’s conference at Oxford, that Physics itself is inherently open to all people who take an interest in it*”. Of the 9 students who went to CERN, 4 have gone on to use their skills as undergraduates in STEM subjects, with others using the skills they developed in other areas including in the creative arts and in industry **\[C\]**. 

 In summary, “Higgs Hunters” has evinced, through rigorous and detailed analysis of data collected from participants, an excellent breadth and depth of public engagement. The breadth is illustrated by 38,000 participants from 179 countries, with some activities recording a fraction of BAME participants rarely achieved in the UK. The depth is illustrated by the analysis of the questionnaire responses and the Talk Forum. In addition, participants and teachers involved in the IRIS activity attest to the significant benefits that the project has made to their skills, confidence and appreciation of the scientific method.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Oral bacteria are implicated in 35\-45% of cases of infective endocarditis \(IE\), a life\-threatening heart infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis \(AP\) before invasive dental procedures is the only prevention measure recommended for individuals at increased risk of IE, but controversy surrounding its use led NICE to recommend against AP before invasive dental procedures in 2008. Our subsequent systematic review of prescription data and hospital discharge statistics identified a significant increase in IE incidence in England, and we have continued to research the link between oral bacteria and IE and the role of AP in IE prevention to inform guideline committee decisions. Our research has influenced the recommendations of AP guideline committees in the UK, the US, Sweden, and Japan and underpinned changes in advice to UK dentists and patients. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Infective Endocarditis \(IE\) is a bacterial heart valve infection with a mortality rate of 30% in the first year. Approximately 35\-40% of IE cases are caused by bacteria that originate from the mouth. Since the 1950s, international standards of care have dictated that antibiotic prophylaxis \(AP\) be given to dental patients at moderate or high risk of IE during invasive dental procedures. However, due to concerns about the risk of adverse reactions to AP, the overuse of antibiotics and the lack of randomised\-controlled trial evidence for the efficacy of AP, from 2007 International guidelines began to recommend reducing AP use to only those at high risk of IE. In 2008, NICE recommended complete cessation of the use of AP, making the UK the only country in which AP was not recommended for those at high risk of IE. 

 From 2013, an international, multidisciplinary team led by Thornhill investigated the effect that the NICE guidelines had on AP prescribing and IE incidence in England **\[R1\].** Using a retrospective secular trend study, analysed as an interrupted time series, the team compared the incidence of infective endocarditis before and after the introduction of the NICE guidelines using prescribing data from January 2004 to March 2013 and hospital discharge episode statistics for patients with a primary diagnosis of IE from January 2000 to March 2013. The Sheffield research found a large decrease in AP prescribing and a highly significant increase in IE incidence, with an increase of 35 cases per month compared to the number of cases before the NICE guideline changed. In 2016, this study was followed with a health economic analysis that established the cost\-effectiveness of using AP to prevent IE in individuals at high\-risk, with an estimated NHS savings of £5.5–8.2 million annually and an annual health gain of >2,600 quality of life adjusted years **\[R2\].** 

 In 2017, Sheffield collaborated with the Centre for Evidence\-Based Medicine in Oxford, to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of AP efficacy. Having identified 178 eligible studies, 36 were included in the review \(10 time\-trend studies, 5 observational studies and 21 trials\). The review concluded that despite the low\-quality and limited evidence base, guidelines advising AP for patients at highest risk provide a pragmatic and justified approach **\[R3\].** 

 Although our research identified benefits for AP in relation to risk, definitions of what constitutes a high or moderate risk of IE have changed over the years, largely based on expert opinion. To clarify this basis for treatment, Sheffield used English hospital admission data to identify individuals admitted between January 2000 and March 2008 with diagnoses or cardiac procedures that might put them at risk of IE. This data was used to quantify and compare the risk of developing or dying from IE for patients who had predisposing cardiac conditions or various cardiac interventions. The results showed that some conditions that had been considered high risk are actually not, and that conversely, some conditions carry higher risk than had been thought **\[R4\].** 

 To investigate whether stopping AP for those at moderate risk of IE might increase IE incidence, we then performed the largest study ever on the impact of the 2007 AHA guideline change. High\-risk, moderate\-risk, and unknown/low\-risk individuals with linked prescription and Medicare or commercial health care data were identified in the Truven Health MarketScan databases from May 2003 through August 2015 \(198,522,665 enrollee\-years of data\). AP prescribing and IE incidence were evaluated by Poisson model analysis. The results confirmed the efficacy of AP for preventing IE in individuals at high risk of IE and demonstrated a much smaller, but still significant, effect in those at moderate risk **\[R5\].**

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impact on national and international policy and public debate 

 In 2015, NICE announced an immediate review of its guidelines stating that the publication **\[R1\]** “triggered an exceptional update” **\[S1\].** While NICE concluded it would not re\-introduce AP for those at high risk because the study was not a randomised controlled trial, the 2015 European Society for Cardiology \(ESC\) in depth review, citing **\[R1\]** concluded that “ *the weight of evidence and opinion is now in favour of the efficacy and usefulness of AP in preventing IE in those at high\-risk*” **\[S2, S3\].** 

 Other national guideline committees also reviewed their guidelines based on our research. The Swedish guideline committee, who had previously followed NICE guidance, switched to follow ESC guidance **\[S3\].** The Japanese guideline committee changed their recommendations to include providing AP for invasive dental procedures to those at moderate or high risk of IE **\[S3\].** The American Heart Association concluded their review in 2020 stating for dental procedures “ *that antibiotic prophylaxis is reasonable for the subset of patients at highest risk of developing IE and at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes from IE*” **\[S3\].** 

 NICE’s decision not to recommend AP for high\-risk patients despite the findings **\[R1\]** attracted considerable scrutiny from the dental and medical press and national and international media **\[S4\].<sup>**</sup> In addition, our research **\[R2\]** supported further scrutiny of and changes to the NICE guidelines. The MP for South Croydon helped a constituent whose husband died from IE following an invasive dental procedure to raise the issue directly with the CEO of NICE, using our research **\[R1\]** as evidence to support a change in the guidelines **\[S5\].** Their efforts successfully influenced NICE to change the guideline wording in June 2016 **\[S6, S7\].** The previous wording was changed to include the word “routinely”, as follows: “ *Antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is not recommended <ins>routinely</ins> for people undergoing dental procedures.*” The NICE CEO said, “ *This amendment should now make clear that in individual cases antibiotic prophylaxis may be appropriate*” **\[S2, S6, S7\].** 

 Impact on UK dental professionals and patients 

 Although the change in the wording of the NICE guidelines removed the barrier preventing dentists from providing AP, the NICE guidelines provided no advice about who should be considered for AP, which invasive dental procedures should be covered, or which AP regimen should be used, causing considerable confusion among dentists, cardiologists, GPs and patients. Our research informed our advice for dentists in the BDJ **\[S8\]** to help them navigate conflicting guidance. The Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Program \(SDCEP\), which provides advice and guidance for dentists in Scotland, provided official advice *Antibiotic Prophylaxis Against Infective Endocarditis* **\[S9\]** in 2018 for the implementation of the NICE guideline 64 using our research findings **\[R1\]** and advice **\[S2, S8\].** It adopted our advice **\[S8\]** that all patients at risk of IE should be advised of warning signs and symptoms after undergoing an invasive dental procedure, regardless of whether they receive AP, which is essential for early diagnosis, improved survival and better outcomes **\[S2\].** The SDCEP advice was endorsed by NICE and the British Cardiac Society and the Chief Dental Officers for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in 2018, making the advice applicable UK\-wide **\[S9\].** 

 In 2019, we worked with the British Cardiac Society and British Heart Valve Society and helped them design a card that patients can carry to inform their dentists about any decision they have made with their cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon about their wish for AP when undergoing invasive dental procedures. It also provides information on AP and on the warning signs and symptoms of IE following any dental treatment or other invasive procedure based on the SDCEP advice **\[S10\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This project on the hidden and neglected story of Cheltenham’s Lower High Street has had a beneficial impact in two main areas. First, by fostering a more sensitive appreciation of the area’s neglected role in Cheltenham’s social and economic development, it increased ‘Understanding and Awareness’. Second, it has altered ‘attitudes’ by using community oral history to challenge the negative stigmatization that has resulted from the neglect of the Lower High Street, something which has been a source of spatial as well as social division in Cheltenham. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Traditionally home to the town’s poorer, working\-class communities, Cheltenham’s Lower High Street has been marked by a visible physical deterioration and institutional neglect over many years, meaning it represents a marginalized community that suffers from ‘symbolic annihilation’ \(Caswell, 2014\). With the University acting as an ‘anchor institution’ \(Alix Green *et al*, 2013\) and collaborating with community organizations such as the Cheltenham West End Partnership \(CWEP\) and the Cheltenham Civic Society  \(CCS\), the research team developed a community\-based project which aimed to integrate this neglected area into Cheltenham’s uneven heritage landscape, and address some of the issues of social and class division that have characterized Cheltenham‘s history. 

 The project had two main elements. First, it was based on oral history research with former and existing residents. Testimonies gave voice to unacknowledged experiences of social marginalization and economic hardship, but also foregrounded positive recollections of a resilient and tight\-knit community. The memories helped to establish the area’s distinctive ‘sense of place,’ which is rooted in a working\-class experience. By volunteering to take part in the project, and in their collective nostalgic responses, the interviewees revealed a significant grassroots willingness to challenge the exclusionary practices of Cheltenham’s Regency narrative, and reclaim the Lower High Street as a significant site of memory \(O’Connell, 2020\). 

 The second element of the project was focused on creating spaces to bring participants and various members of the community together to engage with the oral histories. The testimonies were the basis of two interactive public exhibitions which included the screening of a short documentary film with interviewees, a one\-day symposium, and a permanent virtual exhibition via the project  [website](https://cc4hh.co.uk/other-projects/). These events provided spaces for participants and visitors to share experiences, provide additional information, and take ownership of the discussion on the history as well as the future of the area. The exhibitions were designed around a poem about the Lower High Street that was anonymously sent to researchers, demonstrating how the focus of the research was framed around the ideas and sentiments of participants. The team invited interviewees to contribute to a short documentary film that brought the testimonies to life. The exhibitions were held at Chapel Arts gallery in June and December of 2017, whereas the film was screened on Civic Day in June 2017 and then made publicly available online. Importantly, new participants continue to make contributions to the project via the website as well the project’s social media platforms, so the project acts as growing and evolving archive for the community. Researchers also organised a one\-day symposium in June 2017 which brought together historians, local government, community\-based organisations and residents. The symposium formed the basis for what Andrew Hurley \(2010\) calls the necessary ‘collective stewardship’ required to challenge the exclusionary forces of local heritage practices. In this sense, the project provides a model for Universities to act as ‘anchor institutions’ and working with local organisations to address social and economic issues in their unique geographical and cultural contexts.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The project team adopted three main evaluation methods: 

1.  **Exhibition Feedback, June 2017:** 

 General feedback was gathered from both participants and visitors to the exhibitions on a voluntary basis, through contact details left at the exhibitions, and on the project website. We gathered dozens of comments in a booklet which indicate the way the project connected with the experiences of visitors, and also revealed the areas hidden story to Cheltonians from other areas: 

 ‘Fantastic and thought\-provoking’. 

 ‘As a Cheltonian, I had to think hard about how this part of the town has changed since the 50s, and to consider people’s comments.’ 

 These comments demonstrate the way in which the exhibition was challenging assumptions, especially for those less familiar with the area. 

1.  **Online Impact Survey, 2019\-20:** 

 The exhibition feedback has been corroborated by the results of our survey that captured visitors to the project website and social media pages. This has received 124 responses, 76% of whom had lived or worked in Cheltenham’s LHS area. Importantly, 41.9% of respondents were not directly involved with project, and were responding to their engagement with the virtual exhibition and film, highlighting the project was able to reach a significant audience even after its main public events: 

 <ins>Understanding & Awareness:</ins> 

 81% of respondents agreed/strongly agreed the project gave them a greater understanding of the area’s history. In addition 83% agreed/strongly agreed that the project had increased public awareness of this history. The survey also explored other specific benefits: 

  1.  Have become more aware of area’s history = 57.9% 

  1.  Now have a greater understanding of area’s working\-class history = 46.3% 

 <ins>Attitudes:</ins> 

 59% agreed/strongly agreed that it made their views about the area more positive. Furthermore, 42.1% felt proud of their connection to the area as a result of project, and 27.37% believed it has helped people think differently about the area, as supported by comments: 

 ‘It is great to see how many former residents of the \[Lower High Street\] came forward to share their memories. There is still a bit of snobbery about it from those who live elsewhere in the town but I know several people who now think differently about it and consider it to be one of the places to visit for non\-British food purchases and very eclectic dining experiences.’ 

1.  **Testimonials:** 

 Impact testimonials were gathered from key project partners who corroborated the impact both locally and more widely. Locally, the project has raised awareness of the hidden history of the Lower High Street, while also contributing to a previously unknown sense of pride. Maxine Melling of CCS commented that the ‘project was significant in helping people who lived and worked in the area to tell their stories and to share experiences.’ As Bernice Thomson of CWEP \(who work actively in the community\) acknowledged, the project provided spaces for community organisations to reach and engage new stakeholders, and for different organisations to begin collaborating: 

 ‘we were able to talk to people who would otherwise have been difficult to reach and engage with, which was very positive for us as an organisation… This research raised the profile of the Lower High Street and encouraged people to feel proud of it, which is very significant for us.’ 

 Kishi Allebone of Unit 1 Films remarked that the ‘project highlighted a real sense of regional community. We felt and saw a sense of pride in the Lower High Street and, in turn, I felt proud of my own connection with Cheltenham.’ This sense of pride was reflected in the testimonies of project participants in the short film made for the exhibition, and now permanently on the project website. 

 The testimonial by *Coronation Street* actor Simon Gregson speaks to the project’s broader national reach. The research was used for the ITV documentary ‘Coronation Street’s DNA Secrets’ \(Sep 2018\). The project provided information and context for Gregson’s ancestry in Cheltenham that would have otherwise been unavailable. His statement indicates the ways in which the project has helped bring wider attention to the hidden working\-class history of Cheltenham, and how his preconceptions about the town’s history had been challenged: 

 ‘To learn of the dire conditions my ancestors lived in and the stark divide between them   and the rich folks in their comfortable abodes on the other side of town proved to me that you really needed grit and tenacity to survive as a pauper in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. I hope that I’ve inherited some of that perseverance from my ancestors from the wrong side of the tracks in Cheltenham.’

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The UK **changed its corporate governance code** in 2018, to recommend the usual three\-year period before company executives can sell shares should be **extended to five years**. Several firms have **adopted this policy**, including the Weir Group, Pets at Home and RBS. 

 This policy change was triggered after research described in this case study was **highlighted** in a November 2016 Green Paper on corporate governance from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. 

 Quoting Edmans’ research, it said: “There is **growing evidence** that the usual one to three year holding period for shares provided in executive remuneration packages is **too short and can incentivise short\-term behaviour**.” The Green Paper suggested a solution in line with the research findings: to extend the time before a CEO can cash in equity. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research evaluated a new policy possibility: to encourage companies and regulators to **shift the way CEOs are rewarded**. 

 Starting in 2015 Edmans carried out and published research studies that \(1\) offered some of the **first empirical evidence** that CEO behaviour was driven by short\-term personal financial incentives and \(2\) provided a **possible solution** to encourage executives to run firms for the greater good. 

 The research programme focused on how equity \(shares and share options\), a common part of executive pay, alters the behaviour of CEOs. Company bosses must typically wait a set period of time before they can sell these shares. This creates a **perverse incentive**: to artificially drive up the share price immediately before they can sell their stock. It also gives researchers an **empirical way to measure** this behaviour, by studying the amount of equity that vests \(becomes saleable\) in a particular period. As usual in economics research, the published papers emerged several years after the studies were completed and the findings disseminated and acted upon. Early results were circulated as working papers in 2013. 

 The first study \[published as 3.1\] looked at data for more than 2000 firms between 2006 and 2010. It found that, the more equity that is vesting \(becoming saleable\) in a given three\-month period, the more the CEO **reduced investments** to boost earnings and the share price in the short\-term.  For example, they were less likely to invest in capital equipment or research and development. Specifically, a one\-standard\-deviation increase in vesting equity is associated with an annualized **0.2% decline in growth in R&D**, corresponding to a cut of $2 million per year. It was published as a lead article in *The* *Review of Financial Studies*, one of the most highly\-regarded journals in the world. It also **won prizes** including the Wharton School\-WRDS Award for Best Empirical Finance Paper at the 2014 Western Finance Association \(the most prestigious large finance conference in the profession\) and the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute Research Award, 2017. It later was recognised as one of the five\-most cited articles out of all papers published in the 2017 volume of *The Review of Financial Studies*. 

 The second study \[3.2\] showed CEOs release more positive news **in months in which equity is vesting**, compared with the month prior and afterwards.  The research checked the timing of almost 340,000 corporate press releases issued between 1994 and 2011 against when the relevant CEO was entitled to sell stock. They found **bosses preparing to sell announced 20% more news** in those months and cashed out shortly after announcing news. This paper was also published as a **lead article** in *The Review of Financial Studies*. 

 A third \[3.3\] showed that CEOs selling their equity was associated with companies undertaking share buybacks and announcing mergers and acquisitions \(M&A\) — using data on more than 6,000 companies and 9,000 CEOs between 2006 and 2015. In this case a one\-standard\-deviation increase in vesting equity is associated with a **1.2% increase in a firm’s likelihood of conducting a share repurchase** and a **0.6% increase in a firm’s likelihood of announcing an M&A**, in a given quarter. 

 Both strategies lead to short\-term boosts in share price. Normally, share buybacks are also associated with long\-term price increases. But, the research showed, when associated with CEOs selling stock, they led to the companies showing **poorer financial performance** in subsequent years. A one\-standard\-deviation increase in vesting equity is associated with an **annualised 0.61% higher return** over the two quarters surrounding a repurchase, but a **1.11% lower return the year after**. For M&A, the **negative association with long\-run returns persists** for longer. A one\-standard\-deviation increase in vesting equity is associated with an annualised 1.47% higher return over the two quarters surrounding an M&A announcement, but a 0.81%, 0.35%, 0.72%, and 0.62% **lower return in the first, second, and third, and fourth** subsequent years. This paper **won** the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute Research Award, 2017 and the International Centre for Pension Management Research Award, 2018. It has a revise\-and\-resubmit at the *Journal of Accounting Research*, a top accounting journal. 

 Taken together, this research suggests a **simple and effective way** to encourage CEOs to run companies for more than their personal gain: encourage them to lead the firm for more years **before they can cash in** their equity. 

 Building on this idea, in 2020 Edmans **published a critically acclaimed book** called *Grow the Pie: How Great Companies Deliver Both Purpose and Profit*, which was named to the *Financial Times* Business Books of the Year for 2020. The book shows how companies can create **profit for investors and value for society**, using a “pie\-growing mentality” that stresses the size of the pie is not fixed. His research on CEO pay is a cornerstone of the book, showing that the structure of pay \(which grows the pie\) is more important than the level of pay \(which merely redistributes the pie\). \[3.4\]

###  4. Details of the impact 

 There is **growing demand** among the public and policy makers for **action to tackle short\-term thinking** in the corporate world. So, the research was timely, found a receptive audience and had direct impact on **policy makers**, **business regulations** and **corporate practice**. 

 <ins>Policy makers:</ins> 

 Impact on policy makers came after Edmans invested **substantial effort to disseminate** the findings beyond academia. He wrote an FT op\-ed in 2017, an HBR article in 2018, and gave a Gresham public lecture series in 2018\-9 which included a lecture dedicated to executive pay. He was the guest columnist for Economia, the magazine of the Institute for Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in 2018 and wrote a column on executive pay reform.  In 2017 he wrote and published on his own website a non\-technical guide on how to reform pay that has been **viewed over 10,000 times**. He has also spoken at many industry conferences on pay design, for example hosted by the Investment Association, the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, and the Westminster Business Forum. The research findings received widespread media coverage in high profile publications. For example, they were featured in a *Financial Times* front page article and highlighted in both the *Wall Street Journal* and *The Economist*’s prestigious Buttonwood column. 

 As a result of this outreach effort, Edmans was invited to **testify to the House of Commons** Corporate Governance Inquiry in 2016. The subsequent select committee report, in April 2017, **endorsed the findings of his research** and called for equity to be cashed in “over a genuinely “long\-term” period, normally at least five years”. \[5.1\] 

 The research findings were also **highlighted** in a November 2016 Green Paper on corporate governance from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) \[5.2\]. Quoting \[3.1\] it said: “There is **growing evidence** that the usual one to three year holding period for shares provided in executive remuneration packages is **too short and can incentivise short\-term behaviour**.” The Green Paper suggested a solution in line with the research findings: to extend the time before a CEO can cash in equity from three to five years. 

 <ins>Business regulations:</ins> 

 Following the publication of the 2016 Green Paper, in July 2018 the UK’s Financial Reporting Council revised its Corporate Governance Code, which sets **principles and standards for 2,600 firms** listed on the London Stock Exchange. It said firms should lengthen the time horizon for shareholdings by executives to five years, and that they should hold shares for two years after retirement. \[5.3\] The Financial Reporting Council invited Edmans to speak at the launch event for the new Corporate Governance Code. 

 <ins>Corporate practice:</ins> 

 Several high\-profile firms including RBS and Pets at Home have **switched their practices**. In 2018, the multinational engineering company The Weir Group said it would **make executives wait up to seven years before they could sell stock**. Writing in the company’s annual report, Clare Chapman, chair of its remuneration committee, said the reform was **based on academic research** that indicated “pay packages with less reliance on short\-term performance conditions and requiring large shareholdings, have a positive impact on investment, innovation, long\-term decision making and long\-term value creation.” \[5.4\] As Chapman explained in the Harvard Business School case study on The Weir Group’s pay reform, “Professor Alex Edmans from London Business School … assembled the **strongest possible academic evidence** on pay design and the link with long\-term value. … This provided a **strong rationale for proposals** and gave the RemCo confidence in discussions with both executives and investors that our proposals had a **robust underpinning**.” \[5.5\] 

 Beyond the UK, in 2016 Edmans was appointed in\-house corporate governance advisor to the $910bn Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, which on average owns **1.3 per cent of every listed company** in the world. In April 2017, the fund released guidelines that said CEOs should be made long\-term shareholders because short\-term incentives encouraged them to make poor decisions. \[5.6\] Explaining its decision, it said: “While many CEOs resist such temptations, **academic research supports the notion** that such behaviours exist.” 

 Yngve Slyngstad, head of the fund, told the Financial Times it would start pressing companies to force chief executives to own substantial stakes in their companies for at least five and preferably 10 years. \[5.7\] 

 Attributing change in the complex business world to specific academic findings should be done with caution. But Tom Gosling, then a senior partner at PwC and an expert in executive compensation who advises the BEIS and others on policy, says **Edmans’ research has been instrumental** in driving a rethink on short term incentives in corporate pay. “Prior to Professor Edmans’ work, these concerns had not been documented by rigorous evidence,” he says. This evidence was “ **highly influential**” in encouraging the BEIS to recommend the changes in the UK Corporate Code, he says. And it was “ **directly influential**” in the development of the Norwegian Fund’s pay guidelines. \[5.8\] 

 The 2020 book *Grow the Pie* **won plaudits** from reviewers. Andy Haldane, Chief Economist of the Bank of England, said “Alex Edmans’ superb book makes the case, compellingly and comprehensively, for a radical rethink of how companies operate and indeed why they exist. It is a tour de force”. Dame Helena Morrissey, former CEO of Newton Investment Management, wrote “This is a brilliant and timely book, taking the business case for responsible capitalism to a whole new level.” It has been presented at Talks at Google and is currently being translated into Chinese and Korean.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A key theme that has emerged through Professor Pippa Catterall’s diverse research is the contested ways in which contemporary society chooses to remember, memorialise or indeed forget the Past. This theme has been developed and explored through her direct engagement with heritage organisations and has resulted in the following impacts: 

-  Raising community awareness of local history and social justice through her founding and chairing the George Lansbury Memorial Trust \(GLMT\). 

-  Achieving completion of the Heritage Lottery Fund \(HLF\) supported project at the Grade 1 Crossness Pumping Station and establishing this site as a sustainable heritage attraction. 

-  Increasing inclusivity in public spaces and in professional and heritage practice via work with Arup and the Royal Historical Society. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prof Pippa Catterall has explored the relationship between the Past and the contemporary throughout her career. Since joining the University of Westminster in 2012, she has particularly focused on the relationship between the historical development of politics, religion and identities in shaping contemporary politics and states. For instance, her ground\-breaking monograph on *Labour and the Free Churches 1918\-1939: Religion, Radicalism and Righteousness* \(2016\) ends with a taxonomic analysis of the factors shaping the relationship between religion and politics both historically and in the present \[1\]. 

 Catterall previously explored this relationship between religion, concepts of social justice and politics across the *longue durée*, concluding with analysis of its impact on contemporary policymaking, through a detailed analysis of the shifting nature of the Labour party’s alcohol policy from its Victorian antecedents \[2\]. A similar concern with the relationship between ideals, identities, political structures and changing awareness of the global dimensions of inequality informed her work on the evolution of Labour’s approach to empire and Commonwealth during the twentieth century \[3\]. This latter work intersects with her long\-standing interest in the historical development of identity politics, explored in her *longue durée* analysis of the role of communications in shaping the emergence and characteristics of ethno\-religious identity conflicts \[4\]. This interest in the history and contemporary manifestations of identity politics is exemplified by Catterall’s central role in founding and editing the international multi\-disciplinary journal *National Identities*. 

 This work has increasingly concentrated on the need to bring critical historical scholarship to bear on politicised readings of the Past, reflected through a growing focus on the politics of memory and its intersections with contemporary debates in identity politics. This has resulted in a particular interest in how and what societies choose to remember from the Past, why they do so, and with what cultural and political consequences. This work on identities has also engendered a growing interest in how identities are encapsulated, memorialised or excluded in professions, public organisations and public space. Catterall’s work has thus focused increasingly on heritage in the built environment as a key aspect of the dialogue between those residues of the Past that have been preserved and the contested ways in which contemporary society chooses to remember, memorialise or indeed forget that Past. 

 This turn in her research is exemplified by Catterall’s use of the concepts of Pierre Nora to establish a taxonomic framework for delineating and explaining the social and cultural roles played by *lieux de mémoire* \(sites of memory\) and the politicisation of heritage that can ensue. Catterall focuses upon the need to read the functions of sites of memory critically, rather than reifying them: as such sites primarily function ‘in a dialogue with the Present.... they speak to identities in the Present, and thus to the politics of who we are and how we got here, who is included and what are our values’ \[5\]. These insights were applied to her role in heritage management and distilled into the subsequently published keynote address she was invited to give to the annual conference of the Heritage of London Trust in 2016, attended by 115 architects, planners, conservationists and heritage professionals. 

 Catterall followed this up by exploring the politicisation of memory and the occlusion in contemporary political debates of the historical development of Britain’s relations with Islam. A particular aspect of her analysis concerned the debates around proposed memorialisation in the public realm of the sacrifices of Muslim soldiers serving the empire during the Great War \[6\]. This work informed Catterall’s response to the controversies that erupted in 2020 following the toppling of Edward Colston’s monument in Bristol. In June 2020 she was commissioned by LSE British Politics and History to write ‘On Statues and History’, which argues that these sites represent not history, but what particular groups in the past have chosen to remember, sometimes long after \(as in Colston’s case\) the event or person being celebrated. They should not, therefore, be seen as some reification of that past but instead as in dialogue with the present in which they continue to be sited. 

 Her analysis of public statues and the skewed version of the past that they represent – given that in the UK they are overwhelmingly of figures who are male, white and heterosexual – is an important component of her current research. This work examines how interventions in the public realm can challenge the ways in which history and social order have been conventionally narrativised. For instance, Catterall’s podcasted presentation on ‘Queering Public Space’ to a gathering of 120 practitioners at the international infrastructure partnership Arup explained how the design of spaces, such as town squares, can function in an exclusionary manner due to aesthetic considerations that continue to shape the historical use of such sites by those who have traditionally dominated public spaces. The enthusiastic response from Arup leadership and members of staff from across their international sites led to Arup funding a £15,000 pilot project into ‘Queering Public Space’ in July 2020, on which Catterall is working with Dr Ammar Azzouz \(Arup/University of Oxford\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Catterall’s research interests led to her 2011 appointment as the representative historian on the London Historic Environments Forum and to periodic invitations to advise on various consultations and Heritage Foresight exercises for Historic England. It also led her to apply her research\-based knowledge to memorialisation projects through practical engagement with heritage bodies and professionals, effecting change both in the creation and renovation of heritage spaces as described below. 

#  Raising community awareness of local history and social justice 

 George Lansbury was a key figure in the Labour Party and featured extensively in outputs \[1\] to \[3\]. In 2012, Catterall co\-founded the George Lansbury Memorial Trust \(GLMT\), which commemorates Lansbury’s role as a pioneering socialist, social reformer, suffragist, and East End radical. As Nigel Whiskin, MBE, President of the Trust confirms, in Catterall’s capacity as its Chair: ‘She has consistently endeavoured with considerable tact and skill to focus the committee on the key aspects of GL’s \[George Lansbury’s\] political philosophy and political activities’ \[a\-i\]. 

 GLMT works closely with Tower Hamlets archives and PoplarHARCA \(the housing association that manages the estate named in Lansbury’s honour, located in Poplar where he served as a Labour MP\) **to raise awareness among the local community of its history and Lansbury’s place in it** \[a\-i\]. Every year GLMT organises a memorial lecture delivered by ‘distinguished speakers’ – such as Jon Cruddas MP, Rachel Reeves MP, Chris Bryant MP, Dame Angela Lansbury DBE & Sir Christopher Frayling, Ken Loach, and former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams \[a\-i\]. Whiskin writes: ‘In the choice of speakers for the GL Memorial Trust lectures, Professor Catterall has ensured that we foster GL’s legacy and principles and provide links to contemporary political and social issues that demonstrate their continued significance’ \[a\-i\]. Importantly, as Whiskin indicates, these lectures **encompass aspects of Lansbury’s legacy that are directly relevant to the local community**; for instance, Mike Tyrrell’s presentation in 2019 on social housing and living conditions in both GL’s time and the present resonates with residents of the Poplar Ward given that, in comparison to the rest of the borough, it has a higher than average proportion of socially rented properties and of households with five or more people living in them \[a\-ii\]. Reflecting the community profile, the talks usually attract an ethnically diverse audience of 100\-200 people, as well as leading journalists and local MPs. 

 Other activities include PoplarHARCA and GLMT’s joint organisation of a Film Festival celebrating the work of Angela Lansbury, GL’s grand\-daughter, in April 2014. As the *Evening Standard* reported at the time: ‘Dame Angela said she hoped the festival would also **teach youngsters about the area’s history and her family’s work for social justice’**, and local media attention attests to the success of the festival in achieving the Trust’s aim of bringing contemporary exposure to the work of George Lansbury among the local community \[a\-iii\]. Reporting in the *East London Advertiser* informed their readers that ‘George Lansbury led the 1921 Rates Strike as Mayor of Poplar and went to prison rather than charge the poor the same London precept as richer districts like Westminster’ \(March 2014\) and that ‘Poplar’s Lansbury Estate where the weekend festival was staged was named after George Lansbury, \[and\] built as a showpiece of the 1951 Festival of Britain, an example of “housing for the people” after the Second World War that he had campaigned for in the 1930s as MP and leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party’ \(April 2014\) \[a\-iii\]. This promotion meant the festival successfully reached the community; for instance, at an open\-air screening of *Bedknobs and Broomsticks* in Chrisp Street Angela Lansbury ‘was mobbed by hundreds of fans’, while a session at the 150\-seater Spotlight Centre at Langdon Park, in which she talked about her career and grandfather, was at full capacity \[a\-iii\]. 

#  Completing the ‘Great Stink’ Project 

 Catterall’s engagement with alternative, or underappreciated, sites of heritage can be seen in her work with the Crossness Engines Trust \(CET\). 

 The Crossness Pumping Station is a Grade 1 listed facility opened in 1865. Following the ‘Great Stink’ in the summer of 1858, caused by the stench of the open sewer the Thames had then become, Joseph Bazalgette was charged with creating London’s first comprehensive and effective sewer system. Crossness’ massive beam engines served the pumping station at the outfall of the southern system of the sewers he created. The engines ceased operation in the early twentieth century and the site was in a decayed state when the CET was established in 1987 to restore it. In 2008 CET won a Heritage Lottery Fund \(HLF\) grant of £1.5m towards the £2.7m ‘Great Stink’ project of restoration, provision of heritage facilities and development of a museum commemorating Bazalgette and his contribution to public health in London. 

 Problems with poor governance and lack of public access to the site led to HLF suspending the project in 2010. This remained the situation when Catterall, in light of previous experience with HLF projects with Bexley Heritage Trust \(BHT\) and the Welling and East Wickham War Memorial Trust \(EWWWMT\), was invited to join the CET Board in 2014. Drawing on her expertise in heritage management \(consolidated into her publication \[5\] during this REF cycle\) and earlier research on the history of engineering and engineering management, these two major problems were resolved. This **allowed CET to access the HLF grant money again and thus complete the project.** 

 As Gill Andrews \(the then President of the Society of Antiquaries and HLF mentor on the ‘Great Stink’ project\) writes, Catterall ‘proved invaluable as a trustee from 2014 onwards when CET’s handling of the Heritage Grant funding needed clarification and subsequently substantial updating. Without her input the Heritage Fund would have had concerns about on\-going management and financial control – and indeed the viability of the entire project’ \[b\-i\]. 

 Having **introduced improvements in governance**, including the establishment of a Finance Committee, a ‘\[r\]eview of financial management systems enabled Pippa to move on to updating the Business Plan, another area of CET’s activities where attention was needed and skills lacking’ \[b\-i\]. 

 Meanwhile, the second problem concerning public access could only be tackled through improved relations with Thames Water \(TW\); the overall owners of the site. Catterall persuaded the CET Board to invite TW to appoint a representative to it, Tim Hockney, who proved **instrumental in resolving the access issues associated with the site’s co\-location** with a high\-security TW plant. 

 Through these activities, Catterall successfully persuaded the HLF to allow CET to recommence the ‘Great Stink’ project in 2015. Furthermore, she secured supplementary funds, totalling £50,000 from Cory Environmental Trust, without which CET would have had a shortfall on the partnership funding required to unlock the HLF money. This also **allowed sensitive landscaping of this historic site, which had fallen into disrepair,** through a repurposing of some of the HLF grant. Catterall’s good relationship with Historic England helped to ensure that the many conservation issues this work threw up were dealt with appropriately and as expeditiously as possible. As the former Labour MP, John Austin, then chair of CET notes: ‘it was invaluable to have Pippa, as an historian with a wide knowledge of the museum world and contacts who we could rely on for advice and assistance. Pippa’s professional expertise was also invaluable in our dealings with Historic England over the renovation of the buildings and overall site’ \[b\-ii\]. 

 The CET celebrated the opening of the new museum by Sir Peter Bazalgette, the great\-great\-grandson of Sir Joseph, in July 2016. A year later Catterall succeeded Austin as Chair of CET \[b\-ii\]. In October 2017, exposed asbestos was discovered in the Beam Engine House \(BEH\) section of the site making it a severe safety hazard for visitors and staff. Having immediately closed the BEH, Catterall worked closely with Pam Winders \[b\-iii\] to resolve the situation. Together they **raised funds finally amounting to £492,329 in order to tackle this health and safety problem**. Sir Peter Bazalgette praised Catterall for her work on this matter: ‘just let me say a big thank you to you for everything you’ve done... particularly sorting the asbestos problem\!’ \[b\-iv\] 

 Once in operational mode, Catterall **helped to ensure Crossness was a viable and sustainable site for tourism** by directly drawing on her research expertise in historical scholarship and its public communication. For instance, shortly after the opening of the museum at Crossness in July 2016 an education officer was appointed, both to develop the resources and outreach of the museum and to engage with the local community and schools. In overseeing these developments Andrews states that ‘Pippa brought to the Board exactly what this role needed – a combination of business acumen and academic knowledge’ \[b\-i\]. She notes that ‘CET trustees as a group had considerable technical skills – used to great effect in the restoration of the site – but had considerably less experience in the operational skills required to run a heritage attraction. \[…\] Her \[Catterall’s\] leadership ensured that as interpretation content was finessed it was informed by in\-depth historical understanding while at the same time focus on the commercial viability of the site was maintained’ \[b\-i\]. 

#  Increasing inclusivity in public spaces and heritage practice 

 Catterall’s interest in the linkage between heritage and space \[5\] and how this can shape local environments and create safe spaces for people of all communities and identities \[6\] has resulted in impacts in relation to both urban spatial design and the working lives of historians. 

 Catterall is now collaborating with Arup on a practice\-based research project under the direction of their Associate Director of Integrated Planning \(also their Diversity and Inclusion champion\), Matt Dillon. As Catterall’s collaborator at Arup, Ammar Azzouz, attests, this knowledge exchange has been of a benefit to this professional infrastructure partnership as the ‘themes and questions’ presented and posed by Catterall ‘are of vital importance to architects, urban planners and designers in their quest of more diverse, equal and just spaces’ \[c\-i\]. Azzouz adds that Catterall’s engagement has ‘generated interest from different individuals working in different groups in Arup who are interested in **building a bridge between academics \(as Prof Catterall\) and practice \(as in Arup\) \[…\] as a way to shift the research into more practical settings’** \[c\-i\]. By the end of 2020 Catterall had disseminated preliminary findings from the project to four workshops of Arup professionals in Britain, Europe and North America. Responses conveyed the impact these workshops had in making participants aware of often overlooked issues and exclusions \(‘very telling the privilege that so many of us have that we have been able to not think about this in the past’\) \[c\-ii\]. 

 This work  [intersected](https://blog.royalhistsoc.org/2020/09/28/on-visbility-pippa-catterall/) with a further significant impact, resulting from Catterall’s work with the Royal Historical Society \(RHS\) working group on LGBT\+ Histories and Historians. This working group was set up in 2019 and started its activities by surveying the British historical community, including history students, on the experiences of LGBT\+ people within the profession and attitudes to teaching and research on LGBT\+ histories. Catterall was among the LGBT\+ historians invited to advise on the design of this survey and, in 2020, on an early draft of the subsequent report. She, among others, drew attention to the requirement for more care in addressing this very sensitive subject, and offered suggestions for redrafting. These were considered so helpful that in June 2020 she was invited to join the working group and became **a major contributor to the RHS report on **LGBT\+ Histories and Historians published on 28 September 2020 \[c\-iii\]. Margot Finn, the then President of the RHS, noted: ‘Before you joined our team, there was a real chance of failure\-\-either by producing an inadequate report, or failing to produce one at all. Your contributions, calm commitment, knowledge and savvy have been instrumental to what we've done’ \[c\-iv\]. 

 This report reflects Catterall’s concern to recapture marginalised histories and to ensure their appropriate representation in both historical and heritage practice \[5, 6\]. Importantly, it **provides evidence of discrimination, marginalisation and prejudice towards LGBT\+ historians at all levels** from undergraduate students to senior practitioners, thus enabling and stimulating work in this sector to counter this. As one history graduate writes: ‘This report, the first of its kind, articulates my experience as an LGBTQ student of queer history with validating but startling accuracy – my peers and I are not accustomed to hearing such narratives reflected in policy research. \[…\] This report has given me the ability to name the barriers I have faced, and explain them to others who would usually be unreceptive, for the first time. We cannot underestimate the power of reports like these’ \[c\-v\]. Catterall has subsequently been invited to present at a number of workshops at various universities on how the report’s recommendations can be implemented and used to reshape teaching and research practice in history.

1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Yorke** argues capital punishment is not a legitimate function of US sovereignty. His account of the interplays between the “science” and the constitutional law of lethal injection, unveils that adjudicative processes fail to properly assess lethal injection protocols, and maintain tortuous executions by improperly rejecting sound pharmocology that execution drugs do not minimise pain **\(R01\)**. Applying “ *time study*”, Yorke coins “ *capital judicial time*” wherein the state and prisoner compete to control linearity to respective destinations: execution and natural death. Yorke argues the state likely has a “ *unfair time use advantage*”, and uses the case of Linda Carty, a dual citizen of the UK and Federation of St Kitts and Nevis on Texas’ death row, as an example. US courts have rejected Carty’s constitutional claims through applying a non\-cumulative review. Yorke proposes that the state’s control over “ *when*” and “ *how*” claims are considered demonstrates that it can – through the courts separating the claims in separate hearings \(as \( *e1\) \+ \(e2\)*\) – diminish their factual power. He contends a single hearing cumulative review \(∑ of │ *e1 \+ e2*│\) could properly reveal the compounded nature of the constitutional violations in Carty’s case, and shift the direction of time away from death **\(R02\).** 

 **Cooper** focuses on wrongful conviction and early release. She identified that US courts generally reject challenges to the reliability of forensic science evidence \(e.g., firearms identification\), despite the association between such evidence and wrongful conviction. Instead, courts defer to precedents and rational decision\-making by competent authorities \(e.g., judges, lawyers and jurors\), overlooking limitations in both legal agents’ scientific expertise and legal processes \(e.g., admissibility frameworks and cross\-examination\) for excluding unreliable science **\(R03\)**. Cooper’s evaluation of US clemency procedures \(mechanisms for early release\) for remedying wrongful conviction found limited transparency and decision\-maker expertise; burdensome application processes and proof standards; minimal due process standards; restricted appellate review; and political associations combine to hinder innocence claims **\(R04\)**. This expertise led to a Leverhulme Trust and British Academy Grant Award to analyse US state compassionate release procedures, which typically facilitate early release on ill\-health grounds. This study produced a national account of compassionate release \(including procedure numbers, methods, labels, eligibility, exclusions, processes, and release requirements\) and a blueprint for reform. 

 **Richardson Oakes** and **Di Gioia** have developed models for understanding state resistance to federal policies, explaining partisan litigation tactics as new manifestations of an *un\-co\-operative federalism.* **Richardson Oakes** and Dotto \(a funded PhD Candidate in CALS\) identified that Democratic\-state governors, concerned about global climate change, had initiated similar tactics to oppose the Trump Administration’s rollback of domestic environmental regulation and its notice to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. As part of this, **Richardson Oakes** and Dotto produced a detailed account of US international climate change obligations and the implications of federal rollbacks **\(R05\)**.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at York St John University has changed return to sport practices in national and international sport to improve injury outcomes for athletes. Specifically, our research recommends changes in how the psychological aspects of injured athletes are monitored and return to sport decisions are made. This has led to changes in the practices of \(1\) professional bodies \(e.g., The Society of Sports Therapists\), \(2\) sports coach educators and coaches, \(3\) sports medicine clinics in the UK and overseas, and \(4\) national and international sports teams \(e.g., Hull FC Rugby League, Basketball England, Egypt International Football Team\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The burden of injury in sport is high, and at the same time, return to sport outcomes for athletes following injury are notoriously poor. This suggests that current return to sport practices require improvement. In comparison to the physical factors predicting successful return to sport, psychological factors are less well understood in research and practice. This is where the research of Dr Forsdyke and his colleagues has had significant impact. 

 <ins>Examining the Importance of Psychological Factors and Studying Psychological Readiness to Return to Sport</ins> 

 This line of research began by providing the first mixed studies systematic review of the psychosocial factors related to sports injury **\[3.1\]**. In doing so, this work proposed the first comprehensive conceptual definition of psychological readiness to return to sport. This highly cited review \(87 citations since 2016\) also found that an athlete’s emotions, cognitions, and behaviours are related to sport injury rehabilitation outcomes and that practitioners need to recognise this in order to augment an athlete’s injury outcomes. 

 Dr Forsdyke subsequently published several editorials **\[3.2;3.3\]** aimed at raising further awareness of these issues, and for the first time, providing explicit and research\-informed guidelines for return to sport practices regarding the assessment of psychological readiness. These have provided a heuristic for practitioners and researchers alike. 

 Research was also conducted aimed at understanding injury more broadly. In this regard, Dr Forsdyke published the most comprehensive review of real\-world effectiveness of interventions to reduce sports injury **\[3.4\]**, which found that psychological interventions are efficacious by having a positive effect on injury rates and are efficient in the sense that a relatively low exposure to interventions can lead to a reduction in injuries. Importantly, if injury risk can be reduced, then return to sport practices can be improved by using psychological interventions to reduce the risk of re\-injury. 

  

 In a third strand, with colleagues, Dr Forsdyke adopted innovative and advanced designs to further understand risk factors for injury **\[3.5\]**. The findings from the first prospective study in this area were that perfectionism predicted injury risk in junior academy athletes over time. Finally, Dr Forsdyke conducted research aimed at understanding the psychological processes underpinning the experience of injury **\[3.6\]**. This study found that perfectionistic tendencies predicted coping strategies in injured marathon runners. Taken together, these studies provided the first evidence that personality traits influence psychological readiness for returning to sport. 

  

 Overall, this research has significantly advanced our understanding of psychological readiness to return to sport and has provided a heuristic to enhance decision making. The findings of the work have also influenced several high\-profile consensus statements aimed at improving the management of athletes \(e.g., International Olympic Committee Consensus Statement on Mental Health in Elite Athletes\). The present case study describes the uptake and application of these guidelines in national and international return to sport practices.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 <ins>Influencing Professional Accrediting Bodies</ins> 

 Dr Forsdyke’s research has significantly influenced members of professional accrediting bodies. This includes the Society of Sports Therapists \(SST\), which is the largest professional body accrediting sports therapists in the UK with \~4,500 members. Here, Dr Forsdyke’s publications were made available to members, he recorded a podcast based on his research, and he was invited to represent the SST at the 2019 British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine \(BASEM\) Conference **\[5.1\]**. In 2017, Dr Forsdyke delivered an invited webinar based on his research for the British Association of Sport and Exercise Scientists \(BASES\), the largest sport and exercise sciences network in the UK with \~2,500 members. In addition, the Vice Chair for Education of the BASEM **\[5.2\]**, which has \~1,000 members, has highlighted the relevance of Dr Forsdyke’s research to its members by stating *“\[At the\] BASEM we recognise the importance of this research and our members are aware of this research with this featuring in our professional body magazine and had presence at our annual conference”.* 

 <ins>Changes to Coaching Practices</ins> 

 Dr Forsdyke’s research has also affected FA Coach Educators and team coaches **\[5.3; 5.4\]**. FA Coach Educators are responsible for training and mentoring \~100 coaches per year. The content of Dr Forsdyke’s research has been cascaded down to coaches to develop their practice. For example, one such individual highlighted **\[5.3\]**: *“I use Dale’s research to get coaches to reflect on their own experience of injury and coaching practice to highlight the psychological aspect of injury and returning to football is very rarely considered. I want the coaches I am involved in developing at all levels of the football pyramid to feel more confident to contribute to return to sport decisions and feel empowered to talk to players about how psychologically prepared they are.”* Additionally, team coaches from the UK and overseas have provided testimony that the research has positively impacted their roles. A Director of Football for Ytterhogdals IK and Head Coach for Hull City Ladies FC **\[5.4\]** wrote: *“the research has made me more aware about how important the psychological side of injury is, and I feel more empowered as a coach to keep checking in with injured players about their thoughts and feelings. I now see this as an important part of my role.”.* 

 <ins>Changes to Sports Medicine Clinics</ins> 

 Changes to practice have also been made by Sports Medicine Clinics. This includes clinics in the UK \(e.g., Yorkshire Sports Medicine Clinic, Excel Sports Injury Clinic\) and overseas \(e.g., Glen Sather Sport Medicine Clinic, Canada\). Testimonials from all relevant clinics have confirmed these changes were because of Dr Forsdyke’s research **\[5.2; 5.5; 5.6\]**. The Lead Physiotherapist for the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic **\[5.5\]** highlighted: *“we began integrating self\-efficacy and confidence checks throughout our program, objectively measuring psychological readiness testing... This shift is, in part, due to the impact of Dale Forsdyke’s review and editorial published in BJSM. His research strongly resonates with our clinic.”* Collectively, \~3,600 people visit these clinics a year. These changes apply to all patients and have been in effect since 2017, as such, \~10,800 athletes and patients will have directly benefited from these changes. 

 <ins>Changes to National and International Sports Teams</ins> 

 Most notably, numerous national and international sports teams have changed their return to sport practices because of Dr Forsdyke and his colleagues’ work. This includes professional football teams in the UK \(e.g., York City FC; **\[5.2\]**\) and Sweden \(e.g., Ytterhogdals IK; **\[5.4\]**\), professional rugby league teams \(e.g., Hull FC Rugby League; **\[5.7\]**\), and international basketball \(e.g., Basketball England; **\[5.2\]**\) and football teams \(e.g., Egypt Football Team **\[5.8\]**, Chinese Taipei Football Team **\[5.9\]**\). Testimonials from sports medicine practitioners have confirmed the benefits of these changes. For example, the Senior Team Lead Physiotherapist for Hull FC **\[5.7\]** is quoted as saying: “ *the research* *has positively affected our practice by adapting rehabilitation to meet player’s needs. Prior to this we primarily made clinical decisions based on physical factors*”. These changes, which took place in 2017, are significant in context of UK football, English basketball, and international football, where many matches and tournaments have been played since the introduction of these changes \(e.g., FIFA World Cup\). In the case of Egypt’s international football team, the team doctor **\[5.8\]** has confirmed the importance of these changes: “ *In part, making sure players are physically and psychologically ready to play has contributed to our recent success*”.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 John Turner’s research focuses on historical financial crises. He uses past crises to help shed light on why crises happen and what we can do to prevent future banking crises. Turner’s research has had a beneficial impact on policy\-making, professional practice, and the historical awareness and knowledge of staff at the Bank of England. It has also had a beneficial impact on the non\-academic study of business history and has reached tens of thousands of financial analysts. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Turner has investigated why historical banking systems have been stable and what makes them stable. One of his chief insights is the important role that extended shareholder liability has played in creating stable banking systems. Much of the underpinning research for this impact case study is based on John Turner’s book *Banking in Crisis: The Rise and Fall of British Banking Stability* \[ **Ref 1**\]. This book built on his previous work in this area with Campbell, Coyle and Hickson \[ **Refs 2, 3, 4, and 5**\]. 

 His book was written in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and it asked a key question of importance to central bankers and economic policymakers: can the lessons of the past help us to prevent another banking collapse in the future? *Banking in Crisis* was the first academic study to tell the story of the rise and fall of British banking stability over the past two centuries, and it sheds new light on why banking systems crash and the factors underpinning banking stability. 

 In the monograph, Turner used a novel approach to measure the stability of a banking system. He developed a monthly index of bank share prices stretching back to 1825 and used this index to assess banking stability and identify banking crises. The startling and novel finding from Turner’s research was that the 2008 financial crash represented the first major banking crisis experienced in the UK since 1825. In an article subsequently published in the *Journal of Financial Stability*, Turner and his co\-authors used the bank share price index developed in *Banking in Crisis* to examine the consequences of banking instability. The main finding of the paper was that banking instability increases the cost of borrowing for businesses \[ **Ref 6**\]. 

 Much space in *Banking in Crisis* is devoted to explaining why the British banking system was stable for such a long time. From 1825 until around World War II, shareholders of British banks faced calls on their personal wealth because UK banks were not pure limited liability banks – they had unlimited liability until the 1880s and extended liability thereafter.  This meant that whenever banks made lending decisions, they had ‘skin in the game’, which curtailed them from taking excessive risk. From the beginning of World War II through to the early 1980s, British banks faced stringent government controls which gave them little room for manoeuvre and prevented them from making reckless loans.  Starting in the 1970s, these controls were removed. This deregulation was a recipe for disaster. Over time, banks started increasing their lending, particularly to the risky real\-estate sector, which resulted in a property bubble. The collapse of this bubble resulted in huge losses for British banks and the collapse and subsequent rescue of the UK banking system. 

 The main lesson for central bankers and policymakers from Turner’s book is that banking can only be stable if bank shareholders have ‘skin in the game’ or if banks face stringent government controls on their assets and lending.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Turner’s research has had a beneficial impact on policy\-making, professional practice, and the historical awareness and knowledge of staff at the Bank of England, particularly with regard to its prudential objectives. Insights from his research have reached an estimated 125,000 financial analysts across the globe. His book, *Banking in Crisis,* has sold more than 3,500 copies and has been recognised by the Business Archives Council for the contribution which it has made to the study – academic and professional – of business history. 

 Since 2014, Turner has been actively helping the Bank of England embed financial history into its policymaking, drawing on his research and expertise accumulated while preparing *Banking in Crisis*. His first interaction with the Bank was when he gave a talk based on his book to some 200 Bank staff on 28 July 2014. He was also invited to join three ad hoc committees and to input into the work of a further group as follows: 

-  An external advisory committee which was set up in 2014 to advise Sam Woods, the Bank’s Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation, and his colleagues on how the Bank could use financial history to inform present\-day policy\-making \[ **Source 1,2,3**\]. Turner was the only economic historian in this group. He was asked to advise Bank economists who were examining past crises on the relevance of their work to current policy. \[ **Source 2,4**\]. 

-  A committee on the future governance of the Bank of England which met in September 2014 \[ **Source 1,2**\]. Turner was invited to join this committee by the Bank’s Chief Economist, Andy Haldane. This committee, which included nine Bank of England staff, discussed the future structure and regulation of the UK banking system. Turner was the only economic historian on the committee with a brief to provide the historical perspective on making banking crisis proof. 

-  An expert group which advised the Bank in 2015 on the preservation of the Bank’s archives related to the 2008 financial crisis. Turner was invited to join this group in October 2015 by the Bank’s Chief Economist, Andy Haldane, and by the Bank’s Head of Archives, Mike Anson \[ **Source 1,2**\]. Turner was one of three economic historians on the group. His role was to advise on which records should be preserved from the 2008 crisis to help guide the Bank when the next crisis occurred. 

 Moreover, as a result of advice provided by Turner and others to the first of the aforementioned committees, the Bank of England set up an innovative Financial Stability History Workshop in 2014; this initiative was designed to help staff to develop and share historical knowledge which supports the Bank’s policy making and delivery \[ **Source 2**\]. About 40 Bank staff are members of this group. Turner delivered, by invitation, two talks to members of this group in 2014 and 2018 respectively. These talks were based on content from Turner’s *Banking in Crisis* book and on his forthcoming book on financial bubbles. Turner also participated in meetings of this Workshop in 2014 and 2015, and provided feedback to staff members on their own research \[ **Source 2,6**\]. 

 The Bank’s Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation summed up the contribution of Turner’s research and expertise to the Bank’s policy\-making, professional practice, and staff knowledge and awareness thus: 

 “By helping staff to acquire knowledge about the history of financial crises, Professor Turner has made a valued contribution to the Bank of England’s pursuit of its objectives promoting the safety and soundness of regulated banks and insurers and maintaining financial stability… 

 “The subjects of Professor Turner’s research are directly relevant to the Bank of England’s prudential objectives. His sustained engagement with the Bank means that its impact will be felt through the enhanced policy\-making and supervisory abilities of the staff whom he has helped equip with new historical perspectives.” \[ **Source 2**\]. 

 Commenting on the impact of the Financial Stability History Workshop, two of the Bank’s economists commented: 

 The \[Workshop\] group continues to be extremely popular in the Bank and it has achieved its aim of improving staff’s knowledge of financial history.  The impact of this on policy is indirect and hard to quantify, but could prove very significant. For instance, the former Chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, credits his response to the challenges in the Global Financial Crisis to his knowledge of the Great Depression. \[ **Source 3**\]. 

 The economists also noted that Turner's research and advice had had a tangible impact on specific research and policy debates at the Bank and that, in particular, his work on the history of extended and unlimited liability in the banking system had informed discussions at the Bank about contingent capital \[ **Source 3,5**\]. 

 In addition, the impact of and engagement with Turner’s research has reached well beyond the Bank of England. His book, *Banking in Crisis,* has sold more than 3,500 copies across the UK, Europe, United States and Asia \[ **Source 12**\]. It has been translated into Chinese following demand from that market for a Chinese version \[ **Source 12**\]. In 2015, the book was awarded the Wadsworth Prize 2014 by the Business Archives Council. This prize is awarded on an annual basis for a book which has made an outstanding contribution to the study – both academic and professional – of business history. The citation from the prize committee stated the following: “This is both an original and an important book. …In sum, it is a book that is original, insightful, persuasive, timely and highly readable.” \[ **Source 13**\] 

 *Banking in Crisis* was among the books listed by the blogger and financial journalist, Bilal Hafeez, as essential reading for anyone working in the financial industry. He stated “I accidently stumbled across this book, and couldn’t recommend it more highly for those interested in the banking industry.” \[ **Source 10**\] 

 Writing in the Economic History Review, Mark Billings, an academic at the University of Exeter’s Business School, commented: 

 Not all historians of British banking would agree with all Turner's arguments, but all will surely want to read this stimulating book and recommend it to their students. Regulators and policy makers should also read the book, not least to be shaken from any post‐crisis complacency by Turner's gloomy conclusions on the direction of banking regulation. \[ **Source 11**\] 

 Turner also drew on insights from his research when he was commissioned, in 2014, along with Dr David Chambers of the University of Cambridge, by the global  [Chartered Financial Analyst](https://www.cfainstitute.org/) \(CFA\) Society and Institute to write an article on financial history which was distributed to the CFA’s 170,000 global membership \[ **Source 7,8**\]. Moreover, he was asked to write a thought leadership article on the history of financial crises for the special 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary edition \(Spring 2015\) of the CFA’s *Professional Investor* publication, which is distributed to 11,000 investment professionals in the UK \[ **Source 9**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The novel insight generated by Hemer’s osteological research into early medieval Wales and her commitment to communicating this knowledge has enabled the promotion of the study of scientific subjects in the Welsh\-language. She has generated research stories suited for dissemination via TV, public events, and through online learning media. By contributing to the S4C series Corff Cymru and its online spin\-offs, \(the first of its type for S4C\), Hemer’s research has been used to close the gap in Welsh\-language science programming identified by the Science Advisory Council. She has become the public face of this programming whilst also promoting and encouraging citizen involvement and interest in the archaeology of Wales.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The period of history following the end of Roman rule in Britain is often referred to as the ‘Dark Ages’. However, if we look to the archaeological record, it becomes apparent that such a term is a misnomer, for we are presented with a wealth of evidence reflecting the everyday lives of those early medieval communities including the clothes they wore, the food they ate, the settlements they inhabited, and how they dealt with life and death. Central to our understanding of this period has been the excavation of Anglo\-Saxon cemetery sites from England. However, the contemporaneous burial record from Wales, and the scientific analysis of those excavated cemetery populations have long seemed to offer much potential to archaeologists but have been overlooked by researchers. The presence of ordinary burials, and those of women and children, as well as men, adds to the record provided by more richly furnished burials like those found in England. Hemer recognised and embraced the potential for research into early medieval Welsh cemetery populations, including at St Patrick’s Chapel in Pembrokeshire \(R1\). This work provided a unique opportunity to both add to the archaeological record and engage public audiences with a previously neglected area of Welsh archaeology. Hemer’s osteological, biomolecular, and funerary archaeological research in Wales, conducted at the University of Sheffield and supported by a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship \(R2\), has not only shed light on the health status and dietary practices of those ‘Dark Age’ populations \(R3\), it has also provided evidence for a significant breakthrough in our understanding of long\-distance migration to Western Britain, in particular, Wales. Using the study of skeletal remains, Hemer has shown this practice was not, as previously thought, restricted only to Anglo\-Saxon England \(R4\), and that the movement of people may have been facilitated by the on\-going trade of luxury items imported through a network of interconnectivity between east and west. That people moved alongside the transportation of such material has been woefully overlooked until now. Hemer’s research also challenges an androcentric model of past population mobility by identifying the extent to which women and children migrated into Western Britain during the post\-Roman period \(R5\). Her research exploits novel isotope\-based approaches for gathering evidence of transhumance and successive phases of relocation and residence \(R6\). This helps to explain the key role of child migrants in medieval economies, religious practice, the construction of identity, and pan\-familial social structures \(R5\), but not at the expense of advocating for the importance of childhood narratives in the study of Welsh identity in the past. Hemer’s research has situated ‘the child’ in Wales within a growing discourse around early medieval childhood more broadly \(R5\).

 Science TV programming in Welsh 

 Hemer’s unique approach to the archaeology of Wales garnered the attention of Welsh language TV producers, Boom Cymru, who were looking for content for a new science\-themed series \(Corff Cymru\). This was the first series of its type for broadcast on the Welsh\-language channel S4C and a direct response to concern from the Science Advisory Council that although world\-class research was being conducted in Wales, there was little broadcast on the subject \(S1\). The lack of resources for science in Welsh and difficulty recruiting science teachers to Welsh\-medium schools has also been documented by Estyn, the government inspectorate for education and training in Wales, indicating that this programming could be used to raise awareness of the quality of research in and about Wales and address a significant resources gap \(S1\). Hemer’s speciality in bioarchaeology made her an obvious choice for the producers, who were seeking to address an identified opportunity in S4C’s cultural mission. These were: 

-  to deliver factual programming 

-  bring novel and relevant science based historical research to a broad demographic of the Welsh\-speaking audience, 

-  support independent Welsh TV productions 

-  contribute to internationally significant activities to increase and improve Welsh language use, and Wales’ position in the world \(S2\). 

 Through her insights into the study of the human skeleton and the analysis of historic populations from Wales \(R4, R5\) Hemer provided Boom Cymru with both the overarching story for the production, Corff Cymru, as well as detail for individual episodes. Research utilising historical and archaeological evidence on the biology of the human body enabled Boom Cymru to focus on themes such as how the body works, and the genetic ancestry of the modern Welsh population. As an authoritative, young, female, Welsh\-speaking scientist, she was also offered the role as presenter. This combination enabled the producers to enrich Welsh cultural identity while promoting engagement with science in the Welsh language, and responded to the concerns of the Science Advisory Council and the mission of S4C. 

 Series 1 \(2013\) and 3 \(2016\) focussed on Hemer’s research. Series 1 ‘The Organs’, featured her work on early medieval skeletal remains from Wales, osteological and migratory stable isotope analysis from Llandough in South Glamorgan and work on the Viking Age burials from Llanbedrgoch on Anglesey \(R4\). Series 3 ‘The Body Through the Lifecycle’ was built around her research into child skeletons to explore the development of the non\-adult skeleton and the degeneration of the adult skeleton. 

 Corff Cymru reached more than 210,000 Welsh\-speaking viewers across the UK \(151,000 in Wales, the remainder in the rest of the UK\) and rated consistently at 80% for viewer appreciation \(S3\). Viewing figures equate to approximately 25% of the Welsh speaking audience and are comparable to key Welsh cultural events such as the National Eisteddfod, \(S3\) eight days of competitions and performances, considered the largest music and poetry festival in Europe. Positive feedback provided by the public \(S4\), contributors and the Factual Commissioner \(S4C\) resulted in Boom Cymru submitting the series for a 2013 BAFTA Wales Breakthrough Award. Nominations are bestowed to emerging professionals who have contributed to well produced work of significant impact \(S5\). In addition, Corff Cymru was a significant financial success for Boom Cymru who reported an increase in revenue between 2013\-14 and recommissioned the show for two additional series and a one\-off special \(S2\). All three series continue to be made available for Welsh viewers, via scheduled broadcasts and the Clic Catchup service, reaching audiences of 58,000 for repeat programming and 15,000 for S4C’s service for Welsh language learners Dal Ati \(S2, S3\). 

 Community education and social care in Wales 

 As well as ending a lengthy absence of Welsh\-language science programming \(S1\), the series has been used to support Welsh\-language teaching on scientific terminology by Dal Ati. The bi\-lingual organisation Social Care Wales’ Dementia Hub also uses a production edit to teach carers how activities incorporating art can enrich the lives of people living with dementia \(S6\). This goes beyond the original vision for the series, and makes it available to a demographic of viewers who did not previously access this material \(S6\). 

 In addition to Corff Cymru, Rondo Media commissioned an episode of Cynefin on Hemer’s work with Dyfed Archaeological Trust on St Patrick’s Chapel in Pembrokeshire. This long\-standing relationship between researcher and Trust \(which includes her appointment as a Trustee\) has sought to fulfil their mission of advancing the education of the Welsh public in archaeology, and the commissioned programme is the latest collaboration which fulfils this aim \(R1\). Past projects have included exhibitions \(e.g. about St Patrick’s Chapel in St David’s Cathedral, 2015\) and public outreach \(e.g. guided tours\) around live archaeological excavations \(R1\). Bilingual outreach, led and facilitated by Hemer, as part of the St Patrick’s Chapel project owed its success to being embedded within the local community \(many St David’s residents joined the excavation as volunteers\) and “stimulating ‘grassroots’ community interest in local history” \(S7\). The producer of Cynefin said that Hemer’s expertise in the excavation of St Patrick's Chapel was “ *invaluable to me as the program producer in researching and preparing the item*”, and that her “ *willingness to contribute on camera to talk about her work as an archaeologist and the research she has undertaken excavating in the chapel greatly enriches the item*” \(S8\). 

 The research environment for archaeology in Wales 

 Hemer’s research reputation and expertise on Welsh archaeology in particular led to her co\-authoring the 2017 Research Framework for the Archaeology of Early Medieval Wales \(S9\). This publication sets the national agenda for future archaeological research in Wales, in both academic and commercial contexts. Through the Research Framework, Hemer’s knowledge of the early medieval funerary landscape of Wales and her expertise in the scientific study of Welsh skeletal populations \(R3\-R5\) has informed the direction of research undertaken on cemetery sites/populations in Wales, identified aspects of the funerary record which require further research, and argued for the need to incorporate the excavation of Welsh sites and associated post\-excavation analyses into larger, funded research projects. As such, it is considered to be the go\-to document for those engaged in archaeology in Wales \(including academics, commercial companies and the public alike\), and is published on the Research Framework for the Archaeology of Wales website. Since publication, the Framework has been cited c.170 times in books, academic journals, and commercial reports \(S10\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Sheffield research has contributed to the development of a novel tailored therapy for multiple forms of cancer. The selective killing of a tumour using an inhibitor of a DNA repair enzyme \(PARP\) to induce synthetic lethality was a milestone of personalised cancer therapy. The discovery was patent protected and development rights sold to AstraZeneca. Following a successful clinical trial, the resultant drug was licenced worldwide. Disclosure of the findings stimulated intense investment by Merck and GSK. It has become AstraZeneca’s 4th most profitable treatment, generating over £1 billion in sales. Currently four PARP inhibitors are clinically approved for cancers that previously had few treatment options and have increased progression\-free survival time for patients in 73 countries.

 BRCA2, PARP inhibition and Synthetic Lethality 

 Cancer remains one of the major challenges in global healthcare. In 2005, Dr Bryant and colleagues discovered that cells that had a loss of function in BRCA2 \(a gene associated with a spectrum of cancers\) were susceptible to inhibitors of poly\(ADP\-ribose\) polymerase \(PARP\), leading to cell death \[ **R1**\]. Since both PARP and BRCA are DNA repair enzymes, the team proposed that cancer cells are dependent upon two DNA repair pathways in order to continue to replicate and grow. One pathway requires the PARP enzyme and the second depends upon BRCA2, with the pathways providing redundancy in case one of the pathways fails. By treating BRCA\-deficient cells with PARP inhibitors, both pathways are lost and the cancer cell dies, a concept known as synthetic lethality. Using a mouse model, the work in \[ **R1**\] demonstrated this proof of principle. This was the first evidence of synthetic lethality as a therapeutic agent and has led to multiple drugs based around PARP\-inhibitors being developed for use in multiple types of cancer. 

 Mechanistic studies 

 To underpin the impact of their breakthrough discovery, the Sheffield team performed a series of investigations to understand the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors. 

 It was known that BRCA2 is required for the process of homologous recombination \(HR\). In \[ **R1**\] it was demonstrated that loss of other HR genes also led to synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors, pointing to a general relationship between PARP and HR.  \[ **R3**\] revealed that, in the absence of any exogenous DNA damage, a cell relies on HR to survive when DNA replication forks collapse. This collapse can be caused by disruption of single strand break repair \(SSBR\) and PARP is required for SSBR, thus providing insight into the potential mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors. 

 Bryant also demonstrated that PARP is required for stabilising DNA replication forks \[ **R4**\]. Therefore, inhibiting PARP leads to fork instability and a greater requirement for HR, indicating a further mechanism by which PARP inhibitors induce synthetic lethality. The trapping of PARP at replication forks provides an important insight into the mechanism of PARP inhibitors. 

 In \[ **R5**\] Bryant showed that HR defective cells have hyperactivated PARP, a finding that has led to studies on PARP as a biomarker in cancer treatment. Other synthetic lethal relationships with PARP have also been demonstrated. For example, Ataxia\-Telangiectasia Mutated \(ATM\) was shown to be activated in PARP inhibited cells, with ATM\-deficient cells dying upon PARP inhibition **\[R6\]**. ATM has been linked to T\-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and B\-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, suggesting that these might also be suitable targets for PARP inhibitor therapy \[ **R6**\]. 

 Patenting PARP inhibitors 

 The University of Sheffield filed a patent application in July 2003 for the use of PARP inhibitors as a targeted therapy for tumours occurring in individuals with BRCA2 mutations \[ **R2**\]. The patent has been granted in 32 countries including the UK, US and Japan.  Initially licensed to KUDOS therapeutics who developed the PARP inhibitor *Olaparib*, the area was subsequently developed by AstraZeneca after acquiring KUDOS therapeutics in 2006.

 Following successful phase II and III clinical trial completion using PARP inhibitor research from Sheffield, AstraZeneca was granted first in class drug status for Olaparib \( *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup>\). Since then, the status has been applied to eighteen versions of the PARP inhibitor, four of which are directly attributed to the Sheffield Patent: *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup>, Niraparib, Rucaparib and Talazaparib \[ **S1**\]. \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 Building on those initial applications of PARP inhibitors, this work has led to a step\-change in the development and accessibility of treatments for cancers with few options. In 2020 Nature Milestones cited R1 as a milestone in cancer research for personalised therapeutics \[ **S3**\]. 

 In 2014, *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup> became the world’s first PARP inhibitor approved for use in America and Europe \[ **S4**\]. This success led to further AstraZeneca investment, launching a collaboration with Merck \(MSD UK\) to develop treatments for additional cancers with a BRCA mutation.  *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup> has now had positive phase III trial results in four different tumour types: pancreatic and prostate, as well as ovarian and breast \[ **S5**\]. 

 Initially indicated for the treatment of ovarian cancer, the successful trials led to *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup> expanding to further patient groups in 2017. It is now being prescribed by physicians in 73 countries for the treatment of multiple cancer types. This has increased progression\-free survival time for an additional 15,000 patients \[ **S6**\]. 

 Economic impact 

 Sales of *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup> in the census period have continued to increase each year and have exceeded $1.2 billion in 2020 \[ **S6**\]. AstraZeneca developed a strategic oncology collaboration with MSD UK to expand the uses of *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup> to other forms of cancer \[ **S7**\]. This collaboration, which involved MSD UK buying 50% of *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup> for $8.5 billion, has achieved phase III clinical trial success in BRCA\-mutated pancreatic cancer, which has the worst survival rate of all common cancers \[ **S5**\]. The collaboration went on to work with Myriad Genetics Inc on their BRACAnalysis CDx test to identify BRCA mutations in patients. This test is now used in the USA and Japan to better target PARP inhibitor treatment \[ **S7**\]. 

 The sublicensed patent enabled other companies to produce PARP inhibitors for additional cancer types. Tesaro’s agreement with AstraZeneca contributed to the development of Niraparib launched in 2016 for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers **\[S9\]**. In January 2019, GSK bought Tesaro, for $5.1 billion, to strengthen their commercial oncology capability \[ **S8**\]. 

 Increased survival of cancer patients worldwide 

 Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for 72% and 69% breast cancers in women by the age of 80. The BRCA1 mutation increases the risk of ovarian cancer from 1.3% to 44%, and for BRCA2 mutations the risk increases to 17%. BRCA mutations also increase the risk of breast cancer in men as well as increasing the risk of prostate and pancreatic cancer. Clinical trials with PARP inhibitors have been shown to delay progression by an average of 3 months compared to chemotherapy \[ **S5**\]. 

 Olaparib \( *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup>\) was approved for use in Europe \(EMA\) and the USA \(FDA\) in December 2014 and Japan in July 2018. In 2015, NICE approved the use of Olaparib and Niraparib for NHS ovarian cancer patients, who had had three or more courses of chemotherapy, through the National Cancer Drug Fund \[ **S4**\]. 

 In 2018, Olaparib became available through NHS prescription as a first\-line maintenance therapy in BRCA\-mutated, advanced ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer. Olaparib also became the first FDA\-approved treatment for patients with gBRCAm HER2\-negative metastatic breast cancer \[ **S4**\]. 

 The phase III POLO trial explored the efficacy of *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup> as 1st\-line maintenance monotherapy in patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease has not progressed on platinum\-based chemotherapy. The trial determined that the median progression\-free survival was significantly longer in the treatment group. POLO is the first positive phase III trial of any PARP inhibitor in a disease where there is a critical unmet medical need **\[S5\]** and has resulted in FDA approval for *Lynparza*<sup>®</sup> in the US for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA\-mutated pancreatic cancer \[ **S4**\]. 

 The AstraZeneca sublicensing of the Sheffield patent has led to the development of PARP inhibitors from other pharmaceutical companies for use as treatment of BRCA\-mutated ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal and BRCA mutated breast cancers. Niraparib \(GSK\) and Talazoparib \(Pfizer\) have been approved for use in America since 2018 and Rucaparib \(Clovis Oncology\) was approved for use in America and Europe in 2019 **\[S1\].** 

 In Europe, the use of PARP inhibitors has been extended to ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancers to delay the next cycle of platinum chemotherapy, as well as to increase survival **\[S4\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In an increasingly interconnected, globalised world, the ability to operate effectively across different cultures is critical to building business, political and diplomatic bridges. Professor Helen Spencer\-Oatey and Dr Daniel Dauber have conducted research into intercultural competence, particularly within the context of increased internationalisation of higher education. Via the development of new tools, resources and training materials, the research has improved the cultural competencies of students, graduates and employees, supporting the creation of culturally\-agile citizens who are better equipped for this new globalised world. Their research has enhanced the internationalisation strategies of universities and created new ways to benchmark and evaluate progress against them. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the past three decades, the number of international students worldwide has increased from 0.8 million in 1975 to 4.1 million in 2010 and continues to rise. Universities in most regions of the world are trying to maximise the benefits from this by formulating internationalisation strategies. Yet this raises some fundamental questions around their goals for internationalisation and achievement of those goals. According to the Organisation for Economic Collaboration and Development's \(2018\) Global Competence Framework, university graduates need to have the skills and qualities to \(a\) live harmoniously in multicultural communities and \(b\) thrive in a changing labour market. Since 2009, Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's research has focused on this facet of the internationalisation of higher education. Their research has brought new insights into the identification of the key skills and attributes needed for this, how those skills and attributes can be developed, the educational environment that can foster them, and the extent to which such an environment is being provided by universities and taken advantage of by students. 

 **Conceptualisation of the skills and attributes of 'global graduates'** 

 Despite numerous models of intercultural competence, there was a need to move beyond broad categories, such as 'good at communicating across cultures', to the identification of specific skills that are important for intercultural communication and that can be used to help students develop their competence in communicating effectively and appropriately in intercultural contexts. Spencer\-Oatey's research into different communication patterns and styles and into rapport management \(e.g. **R3.1** and **R3.2**\) led to the specification of a number of key elements \(e.g. handling turn\-taking; giving negative feedback without causing offence\) and has subsequently fed into the development of training resources, including Working in Diverse Groups. 

 **Conceptualisation of the educational environment that can foster 'global graduates'** 

 Conceptual and empirical research by Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber \(e.g. **R3.3, R3.4, R3.5** and **R3.6**\) revealed the importance of 'mindful interaction' for fostering 'global graduate' skills and attributes. This entails students being sufficiently motivated to move out of their comfort zones, engage in experiences of difference, and reflect carefully on those experiences. The same research indicated that there were 'student silos' and that the increasing diversity of students on university campuses was not necessarily leading to greater 'mindful interaction' among students. This led Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber to seek an evidence\-based picture of the situation and to develop a tool that could provide it. 

 **Development of a profiling tool with an empirically robust conceptual foundation** 

 Several organisations \(e.g. Times Higher, QS\) publish worldwide rankings of universities for internationalisation, but their criteria are all demographic/structural in nature \(e.g., number/proportion of international students and staff, and the amount of outward/inward mobility\) and provide no information on the development of the global graduate skills and attributes identified by Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's research. Other surveys \(e.g. National Student Survey, Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey\) are unsuitable because they do not incorporate an international element. Although i\-graduate – one of the world's major players in running surveys in the HE sector – offers a relevant survey, the \(International\) Student Barometer ISB/SB\), it only includes one or two questions on friendships. 

 To address this need, Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber designed an internationalisation KPI tool, the Global Education Profiler \(GEP\). To understand how 'global graduates' can be fostered, their research focused on the contexts and factors that help nurture such competence. They analysed: \(a\) what universities are providing to encourage the development of global graduate skills and attributes, and \(b\) the extent to which students are engaging with such opportunities. They identified five core constructs: social integration, academic integration, communication skills, foreign language skills development, and global opportunities and support. Ten items were written to probe each construct, with each item being rated twice on different Likert scales: 'importance to me' and 'my actual experience', so that both attitude and experiential engagement could be probed. After initial pre\-piloting, they ran the GEP at six different universities in 4 different countries, and statistical tests confirmed that the constructs are both valid and reliable. They then started running the tool on a larger scale and analysing the findings \( **R3.7**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on individual universities' internationalisation strategies and initiatives** 

 The internationalisation KPI tool, the Global Education Profiler \(GEP\), **\[E5.1\]** has been used by 22 universities over the assessment period in the following countries: Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Spain, the UK, and Uruguay. It is the only strategic planning tool available to Higher Education institutions that moves beyond structural and compositional benchmarking and provides a meaningful measure of global skills growth. Each university had their own context\-specific purposes for running the GEP but, in all cases, it enabled them to gain an institution\-wide picture of their strengths and weaknesses in internationalisation. Many used these insights to plan initiatives and improvements. At Durham University, the Dean for Internationalisation 2015\-2018, was ""impressed by the level of detail that we might be able to glean from the GEP survey which focused on the gap between student expectation and experience over a number of areas key to our strategy \(especially social and academic integration, and global opportunities and support\)."" Durham used the GEP in 2017 and the data “helped us become more aware of the impact that different levels of diversity across departments and Colleges was having on student integration and their opportunities to develop global skills."" On the basis of this finding, the University adjusted its recruitment strategy, and this led to a greater range and spread in student diversity. In addition, the GEP data led to a refresh of the Durham Award, which recognises student skills development. The GEP results were used to inform the design of the new Durham Inspired Award, launched in September 2019 with 800 students registered in 2020. **\[E5.2\]** The University of Padua used GEP findings to inform staff internationalisation training in the summer of 2020. The Italian university also used the results to underpin a consortium tender to the European Commission regarding initiatives to promote global and intercultural learning. **\[E5.3\]** 

 **Impact on the development of university students' intercultural skills** 

 Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's research insights into the nature of global graduate skills and ways of fostering them have been applied to the design of training resources and an e\-course on intercultural awareness/skills which have been used to underpin training across the University of Warwick, and at other universities in the UK, Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland. 

 At Warwick, there has been a year\-on\-year increase in participants, reaching nearly 1000 in 2018\-19. Over the programme, participants recorded a 12.7% increase in their intercultural competence. Feedback comments included: ""I was able to recognize myself in all of the different sections and become more aware of the way I communicate and interact with others. The content of the course really made me more conscious and aware of these behaviours and patterns therefore, I will be more capable of adapting. I have definitely gained analytical skills to understand communication better."" **\[E5.4, E5.5\]** 

 The Deputy Head of the International Office at the University of Applied Sciences, Northwestern Switzerland, said that the e\-course had challenged students to reflect on how they were handling particular situations: “In my experience, they often underestimate the impact of cultural differences in intercultural teams, since they all identify themselves as young, open\-minded, well\-travelled global citizens. There is also an understandable reluctance to ‘rock the team boat’ and potentially endanger the project outcome. As an intercultural coach, it is important, however, to encourage students to stretch and grow and learn. Here the e\-course content helped greatly.’’  **\[E5.6\]** 

 The training aspect of Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's work was cited in the Russell Group January 2018 response to the Migration Advisory Committee's commissioned report into the impact of international students in the UK. They referred to the importance of intercultural training to maximise the benefits of cultural diversity and used Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber's research as an example of best practice. **\[E5.7\]** 

 **Impact on internationalisation benchmarking and policy\-making at network, national and supra\-national levels** 

 The GEP was selected by the Coimbra Group \(a consortium of renowned European universities\) for internationalisation benchmarking purposes following a presentation by Spencer\-Oatey to rectors and vice\-rectors of the Coimbra Group, which involved detailed discussions on ways of profiling internationalisation 'performance'. As a result, the Coimbra Education Executive Board \(EEB\) contracted with i\-graduate to run the student and staff versions of the GEP at member universities. Their network\-level insights have enabled them to \(a\) benchmark internationalisation across a significant number of European universities in their network, \(b\) take the lead in promoting best performance in internationalisation within Europe, and \(c\) demonstrate to the European Commission \(EC\) the network's forefront role in achieving this. The anonymous benchmarking is allowing them to assess competencies and develop strategic policies to enhance internationalisation across their network. Thirteen universities participated in phase 1, and further universities are expected to participate in phase 2. Initial findings were presented to the EEB in early September 2019 and attendees reported being particularly impressed by two elements: \(a\) the role of the GEP in identifying and elucidating areas of underperformance, and \(b\) the value of this for planning policy development. Full benchmarking results from Phase 1 were presented at a high\-level Coimbra network event in Tartu in December in 2019 \(attended by Gyula Cserey, Deputy Head of Unit, Higher Education, EC\) and this was followed up by a presentation in Brussels to the DG Education, Youth, Sport and Culture of the EC at the end of January 2020. Chair of the Coimbra Group wrote: “Institutions may undertake formal student surveys and evaluations, but these very rarely probe deeply into questions on academic and social integration, language skills, intercultural competence, and opportunities to study or work in another country or culture. Another important, but often neglected, area to survey on internationalisation is the perspectives of staff as educators and administrators. We selected the GEP as the best available tool of its kind to help our members benchmark in key areas of internationalisation.’’ **\[E5.8\]** 

 Within the UK, Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber were invited to have a one\-hour discussion on 10 October 2019 with Jack Thomlinson \(Senior Policy Advisor\) and Gemma Turnbull \(Senior Policy Advisor International Education\) from the Department for Education about ways of implementing the government's internationalisation strategy, including possibilities for benchmarking or developing a kitemark. **\[E5.9\]** 

 **Impact on a commercial company** 

 i\-graduate is part of the Tribal Group, which offers products and services to the education sector. Tribal Group’s Marketing Business Partner said licensing the GEP from the University of Warwick in 2016 fitted well with its portfolio of evidence\-based global solutions and services. “In particular, it gave us further opportunity to use our survey experience to gather and analyse data in the area of internationalisation, and subsequently align i\-graduate with this evolved view of the internationalisation agenda.’’ Since licensing the GEP, the company has collected data on internationalisation from over 26,000 students and staff who are studying/working in universities across 14 \(primarily European\) countries. Tribal Group added: “Globally, the student experience, both for domestic and international students, is central to the majority of Higher Education institutions’ strategic decision making processes and, as a result of using the GEP, we as an organisation are able to understand the student experience in an increasingly evidence\-based, objective and comprehensive manner. This has meant that we are more effective in helping those operating in education. 

 “Our customers have cited the value of using the GEP in a range of applications: on an ongoing basis to evaluate the effectiveness of new internationalisation strategies; to benchmark internationalisation across their networks of institutions; to assess and benchmark performance in internationalisation; and to aid the development of students in culturally diverse universities.’’ \[ **E5.10\]** 

 **Impact on global skills for the workplace** 

 In mid/late 2019 Spencer\-Oatey and Dauber received requests for a comparable tool to the GEP with a greater workplace focus. This led them to develop and successfully pilot the Global Fitness Profiler \(GFP\), which has a three\-pronged focus: two developmental factors \(the organizational context and employee engagement\) and a suite of intercultural competence outcomes. A Chinese electronics company, Oppo, piloted the GFP across one of their departments and found the feedback very valuable, commenting that the GFP ""has made us more confident over our team's future development"" while it also ""allowed us to identify areas needing further development"". **\[E5.11\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by the University of Liverpool Management School adapted Value\-based Procurement \(VbP\) to transform national public procurement in social housing and healthcare. From 2014, the research led *Inprova Group*, who procure for approximately 3.7m social housing properties, to change their business model and processes to set VbP as the new procurement standard for social housing. The changes reach 90% of the UK’s social housing market and have delivered procurement savings totalling £102m for over 1,000 housing organisations. Savings have been reinvested to fund employability projects, housing improvements, and rent reductions delivering social benefits for tenants. The impact’s significance and reach increased from 2019 when NHS Wales and NHS Supply Chain Coordination Ltd used VbP in their procurement policies to reduce healthcare costs, increase service capacity and improve clinical outcomes for patients across their respective procurement spend of £800m and £6.6bn. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research at the University of Liverpool Management School from 2012\-2020 used value\-based procurement \(VbP\) to assert the centrality of both economic and social value in public procurement. Contrary to conventional views that these are contradictory, the research identified their mutual complementarity, offering opportunities for national purchasing organisations to substantially improve the extended value delivered through procurement. 

 The research was initially conducted in collaboration with the *Inprova Group* \(2012\-2020\). *Inprova* operate as *Procurement for Housing* \(PfH\) to provide procurement services to approximately 1,000 social housing organisations that collectively manage 3.9m of the UK’s 4.1m social housing properties. PfH are the sector’s largest procurement provider and are supported by standard\-setting professional bodies \- the National Housing Federation, the Chartered Institute of Housing, and HouseMark. Additional sector research funding was via a Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Cartrefi Conwy Housing \(Technology Strategy Board, 2011\-2013\); a CASE\-funded PhD with Equity Housing Group \(ESRC, 2016\-2020\), Liverpool Mutual Homes, and the Re:Allies procurement consortium \(2015\-2016\). From 2015, the research developed in the NHS with research funding from NHS NW Procurement Hub.  Research funding total £283,000. 

 The research took a systems\-level perspective to investigate the legacy of government policy on regulated procurement. The data evidenced how public sector environments have historically been shielded from commercial realities in their procurement decisions \[3.1\] and revealed why this has resulted in procurement’s low status despite spend profiles of national economic importance \[3.2\]. Specifically, the research identified systemic problems in public procurement stemming from government policies \[3.4\], and revealed how process compliance, as opposed to value delivery, had become the dominant focus \[3.5\].  The research explained why prior approaches fail to deliver public benefit, notably: that standardised demand aggregation methods were commercially suboptimal and create supply market concentration over time \[3.4\]; the universal lack of supply market and spend data intelligence to aid value assessments \[3.2\]; and annual performance metrics that prevent suppliers’ investment in innovation \[3.3\]. 

 By using VbP, alongside an explicit recognition of the political context, the research offered novel collaborative solutions for procurement centred on long\-term value rather than annual unit prices alone \[3.4\] and identified procurement methods that are able to re\-balance commercial priorities with long\-term social/health outcomes \[3.1, 3.4\]. The research argues for the application of new data\-led business models for procurement consortia \[3.1\] that leverage spend data to shape equitable commercial outcomes and social value over the longer\-term \[3.4, 3.6\]. Applying these insights to social housing and healthcare contexts has resulted in a fundamental reframing of how, and when, beneficiaries, cost, and value are considered and managed in procurement processes. 

 The research challenged dominant methods and positions procurement as the precursor to achieving wider public policy goals of Value\-based Healthcare and Best Value. Since 2012, our emerging research evidence had high\-profile dissemination via 35 invited articles in the professional press and over 55 keynotes, roundtables, workshops and talks at national events to CEOs, CPOs, CFOs,  public procurers, trade associations, and strategic suppliers, placing the research at the forefront of critical national procurement policy debates about why existing procurement methods were not fit\-for\-purpose in emerging market contexts, why it mattered, and crucially, what to do about it.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  Impacts on national public procurement policies 

 VbP has been adopted as the new procurement standard in social housing and NHS England and Wales. The high\-profile dissemination of the research in the social housing sector led to PfH securing a mandate from its 1,000\+ clients to change their procurement standards. Between 2012\-2014, PfH used the research to implement a “ *wholesale adoption of value\-based procurement principles”* \[5.1\] across the management of their clients’ £0.5bn annual procurement spend. PfH are pivotal in setting the sector’s procurement standards as they represent 90% of the UK’s 4.1m social housing properties and are supported by the three standard\-setting professional bodies \- the National Housing Federation, the Chartered Institute of Housing, and HouseMark. Thus PfH’s “ *wholesale adoption of value\-based procurement principles”* sets the standard in the social housing sector, and as their Managing Director states: *“The value\-based approaches have reached universal acceptance and now ‘this is how we buy’ in the sector”* \[5.1\]. He also confirms the extent of transformation and impact of the research on that process: *“Despite its apparent simplicity, balancing commercial and social value in regulated procurement is extremely complex and Dr Meehan’s research was critical in helping PfH develop appropriate solutions... and led to root\-and\-branch changes in our practice and outcomes”.*  \[5.1\] 

 In the NHS, the research formed the basis for 80 workshops, strategy meetings, and away\-days to policy working groups, procurement staff, and suppliers, and is referenced explicitly in the NHS Supply Chain’s VbP training delivered to 150 commercial procurement staff \[5.2\]. Supply Chain Coordination Ltd \(SCCL\), the management function of NHS Supply Chain, are adopting VbP across their £6.6bn annual spend to transform NHS procurement. SSCL’s Value Based Procurement Lead confirms the research *“…put VbP clearly on the map for the NHS”,* and states that: *“The University of Liverpool’s research, and the team’s continued engagement, has been instrumental in the pursuit to promote and engage the NHS’s journey to adopt VBP… \[I\]t has added a distinct level of credible evidence of what could be done, and it challenges us on how we need to change* \[5.3\]. 

 The Head of Strategic Sourcing for NHS Wales confirms the importance of the research in identifying the “ *changes needed to existing approaches* \[and\] *stimulating debate on the potential of procurement to deliver broader value”.* NHS Wales adopted VbP in 2019 as their procurement standard for their £800m annual spend \[5.4\]. 

###  Economic impacts to PfH and social housing organisations 

 Between 2014\-2019, PfH’s adoption of VbP delivered substantial financial savings totalling £102m to social housing organisations \[5.1\]. Savings resulted from commercial opportunities identified by the research to reposition PfH as a knowledge hub.  PfH introduced two new services to the market – bespoke consultancy and spend data analytics. In 2015, PfH’s parent company, *Inprova Group* acquired the firm Valueworks to extend their data analytics and they secured a 10\-year £6.5m contract to introduce VbP to the North American housing market. PfH have grown their spend under management by 200%, despite an incredibly volatile period within social housing. 

###  Social impacts for tenants 

 Consistent with the central logic of VbP, financial savings have led to significant social benefit as PfH’s clients have reinvested their share of the £102m procurement savings to improve tenants’ lives. The CEO for Newark & Sherwood Homes, states that: *“Categorically every penny saved* \[from PfH\] *has gone into social value”* \[5.5a\], enabling them in 2018\-2019 to build 65 new affordable houses, fund 468 home adaptions enabling older tenants to live independently, and install 308 energy\-efficient boilers \[5.6\]. 

 Other PfH clients, as explained by the CEO for First Choice Homes Oldham, “ *...used the procurement savings* \[from PfH\] *to offset the 1% impact and protect frontline services”* \[5.5b\]. The ‘1%’ refers to the UK Government’s Welfare Reform and Work Act \(2016\) that mandated social landlords to reduce rents by 1% annually for four years. The 1% rent reduction protected access to affordable housing for an estimated 1.2m financially insecure households. Frontline social value initiatives that the savings protected for First Choice Homes included, home care support for 162 people discharged from hospital and training on employability skills for 487 unemployed tenants with 223 people sustaining jobs beyond six months \[5.7\]. 

###  Healthcare Impacts for Patients and Providers 

 Although the NHS only adopted VbP from late 2019, impacts are already significant because of the scale of their procurement spend. For a national procurement of blood thinning solutions, NHS Wales adopted VbP to assess total costs over a longer timeframe, resulting in a new supplier collaboration that enables patients to self\-monitor blood levels. Patients benefit by getting early indicators of life\-threatening conditions, and self\-monitoring requires fewer GP and hospital appointments.  NHS Wales report drastic cost reductions as a significant percentage of their 400,000 annual blood test appointments are eliminated, deployment of ambulance services reduced, and GP/hospital service capacity increased \[5.4\]. 

 In 2019\-2020, NHS Supply Chain commissioned 13 ‘proof\-of\-concept’ pilot projects for VbP. Initial results have improved patient care and delivered operational efficiency, and VbP is being rolled out across NHS England’s £6.6bn procurement spend \[5.3\]. A proof\-of\-concept pilot, from Manchester University’s NHS Foundation Trust adopted VbP for parotidectomy sealants \(the surgical removal of salivary glands\) to assess tenders against patient pathway costs, a step change from the previous approach of only comparing sealant product costs. This use of VbP led to the procurement of a more expensive sealant, but crucially this enables patients to be treated as day cases eliminating 2.5 days in hospital per patient, improving patients’ experience, freeing up vital bed capacity, and reducing the cost per procedure from £880 to £75 \[5.8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 High sugar diets have critical, costly health implications. Research at the University of Leeds on dietary carbohydrates and cardio\-metabolic health outcomes provided key evidence to the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, leading to changes to government policy and industry practices, including new UK dietary guidelines for free sugar and fibre intakes, a ‘Soft Drinks Industry Levy’ and sugar\-reduction reformulation by the international food industry. Consequently, the content of sugar in sugar\-sweetened beverages has fallen by 43.7% since 2015 and the dietary intake of free sugars has reduced significantly across all age groups. Additionally, the research has influenced international policy development. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Drs Burley and Evans are members of the Nutritional Epidemiology Group \(NEG\) within the School of Food Science and Nutrition at the University of Leeds. They work closely with Dr Greenwood, a senior biostatistician in the Faculty of Medicine and Health. NEG gained World Health Organization collaborating centre status in 2018. Its epidemiological research linking diet to chronic disease development, and evaluation of dietary behaviour change, are recognised internationally. 

 Through a competitive bid in 2010, the Department of Health \(DoH\) commissioned a team led by Drs Burley and Evans to undertake the most extensive systematic review and meta\-analysis of published research linking the quantity and quality of dietary carbohydrates to cardio\-metabolic health outcomes. The outcomes included cardiovascular disease, blood pressure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, lipidaemia, cholesterolaemia, obesity, and inflammation biomarkers. 

 From 2010 to 2012, the research team systematically reviewed evidence from 42,583 published scientific papers. They conducted more than 100 meta\-analyses using extracted data from both randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies for each outcome where available. Key findings were published in prestigious peer\-reviewed journals **\[2, 3, 4, 5\]** and the body of research contributed to all chapters on cardio\-metabolic health outcomes in the ‘Carbohydrates and Health Report’ published by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition \(SACN\) in draft and final versions in 2013 and 2015, respectively **\[1, A\]**. 

 The research findings from the Leeds team made up 60% of the total body of evidence in the final report **\[1, A\]**. This included analysis of data on the intake of sugars and fibre, as well as related dietary patterns such as low glycaemic index \(GI\) diets, and their relationships with cardio\-metabolic health outcomes. The key findings from the systematic reviews and meta\-analyses were: 

-  Consuming one 330 mL can of sugar sweetened beverage \(SSB\) per day was associated with a 20% and 23% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus for adults and children respectively **\[1, 2\]**. 

-  Every 7 g/day increment of total fibre intake reduces the relative risk of all cardiovascular events by 9% **\[1, 3\]**, type 2 diabetes mellitus by 6% **\[1\]** and first stroke by 7% **\[1, 4\]**. Seven grams of fibre is the equivalent of two slices of wholemeal bread and one bowl of high fibre cereal. 

-  Every 5 GI unit increment increases the relative risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus by 8% **\[1, 5\]**.  Diets with a low GI are characterised by higher intakes of wholegrains, legumes and types of fruits and vegetables. 

 The research recommended consumption of ‘complex’ rather than refined carbohydrates in foods and drinks to reduce the risk of cardio\-metabolic disease **\[1, 5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Policy Impact** 

 Drs Burley and Evans undertook the most extensive systematic review and meta\-analysis of published research to date linking carbohydrate quantity and quality to cardio\-metabolic health outcomes. In 2012, Burley and Evans presented their findings to SACN, including senior policy makers from Public Health England \(PHE\). The research findings were used in all chapters on cardio\-metabolic health outcomes, constituting 60% of the evidence in the overall ‘Carbohydrates and Health Report’, published by SACN as a draft in 2013 and as a final version in 2015 **\[1, A\]**. The contribution by Leeds researchers is acknowledged both within the report **\[A\]** and by the SACN carbohydrates working group chairman stating: “Dr Evans and colleagues contributed substantially to the evidence base for the conclusions and recommendations drawn by SACN” **\[B\]**. 

 The research underpinned SACN’s rationale for urgent policy action on sugars and fibre. Within three months of the final report publication, UK government dietary guidelines were changed for free sugars and fibre **\[C\]** and PHE published their report ‘Sugar Reduction: The Evidence for Action’ **\[D\].** This document recommended a range of actions to reduce the consumption of free sugars, including a Soft Drinks Industry Levy \(SDIL\) **\[F\]** which was announced in March 2016, closely followed by the Childhood Obesity Plan by the DoH that incorporated actions to reduce sugar intake by children **\[E\]**. By 2018, when the SDIL was implemented, many drinks manufacturers had reformulated their products to meet the criteria **\[F\]**. The impact of Leeds research is underpinned by the SACN carbohydrates working group chairman who stated: “Government accepted the SACN Carbohydrates Report in 2015 and then began developing policies to implement the recommendations as part of the Childhood Obesity strategy and with wider nutritional policy” **\[B\]**. This evidence has, therefore, directly led to impacts on public health policy and industry practices through dietary guidelines **\[C\]** and statutory legislation on sugar content of SSB in the UK **\[F\]**. 

  

 **Change to Dietary Guidelines in 2016** 

 Based on evidence provided by Leeds **\[1,2\]**, reported by SACN and PHE on sugar intake **\[A, D\]**, PHE changed the recommendation for sugar intake for the population from 11% to 5% of food energy **\[C\]**. The evidence on fibre intake **\[1, 4, 5, 6\]** led to an increase in the total fibre recommendation from 24 g to 30 g per day **\[C\]**, expressed using the definition by the Association of Analytical Chemists. 

 **Implementation of the SDIL and Reformulation of Foods and Drinks** 

 The SDIL outlined the criteria for placing a levy on SSB with sugar contents above 5 g per 100 ml. The soft drinks industry was given two years from 2016 to voluntarily meet the criteria by reducing sugar levels in their products. PHE published a report on the progress made between 2015 – 2019 which included the following highlights **\[p53\-54 in F\]**: 

-  A 54.2% increase in sales of lower sugar products exempt from the levy. 

-  A 54.8% reduction in sales of higher sugar products in levied categories, equivalent to 514,624 litres. 

-  A 3.0% reduction in the sugar content of foods and drinks overall and a 43.7% reduction in sugar content of drinks included in the SDIL. 

-  A 35.2% decrease in energy consumed from SSB on a single occasion. 

 In 2019, members of the Royal Society for Public Health \(RSPH\) voted the SDIL as the second greatest public health achievement of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The society stated that the levy signalled a shift towards greater recognition of the role played by the food and drink industry in enabling healthier choices and will continue to have a strong positive impact on public health **\[G\]**. The Public Health Minister reported at the time ‘The Soft Drinks Industry Levy is ground\-breaking policy that will help to reduce sugar intake’ **\[G\]**. 

 **Reductions in Daily Free Sugar Intake** 

 National Diet and Nutrition Survey \(NDNS\) data for 2016\-19 was recently published and compared to the previous 2 years. Significant reductions in the intake of free sugars were seen in all age groups. Percentage of energy from free sugars reduced from 13.5 to 12.1% in children aged 4\-10, from 14.1 to 12.3% in adolescents aged 11\-18 and from 11.1 to 9.9% in adults aged 19\-64 **\[table 3.10, H\]**. Average SSB consumption reduced by 26% from 191g/day in 2014\-16 to 142g/day in 2016\-19 in adolescents \(the highest consumers\) **\[table 7.10, H\]**. Evans also reported a 19% reduction in the content of free sugars in children’s packed lunches after the publication of the draft SACN report **\[I\]**. 

 **International Reach** 

 The SACN report is accredited in a policy context document by the Australian Government Department of Health as providing evidence for new dietary guidelines on sugar intake **\[J\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 UoP research has led to the development and implementation of water management technologies. New treatment technologies and site modelling implemented by a major UK water company improved wastewater treatment performance giving enhanced environmental protection and substantial cost savings.  Increased performance of novel and enhanced package sewage treatment plants has reduced cost and stimulated commercial growth of SMEs. Research on blue\-green water management systems has informed policy, improved environmental protection and provided commercial benefits to industrial collaborators. Lastly, novel soil washing technology has been developed and applied to achieve large scale hydrocarbon remediation at industrial sites. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UoP research has led to the development and implementation of novel wastewater technologies. Research is undertaken at our unique Environmental Technology Field Station \(ETFS\) or at real\-world sites to understand wastewater treatment processes through a combination of fundamental science and engineering approaches. The body of research underpinning the impact is across four technologies in particular: 

-  Conventional Small waste\-water treatment works \(WwTW\) 

-  Package treatment plants 

-  Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) 

-  Novel materials in combination with natural systems for wastewater treatment 

 The team apply a range of approaches, for example: focusing on specific pollutants \(e.g. phosphorous, hydrocarbons\), optimising design and operation, and/or demonstrating the efficacy of technologies in real\-world settings. 

 The UoP ETFS is a unique facility located at a waste\-water treatment works which was extensively upgraded in 2015 with a UoP investment of over GBP150,000.  Pumped sewage supplies from various WwTW stages allow research at operationally relevant pilot\-plant scales.  Test bed facilities, including a 20m greenhouse and dedicated laboratories, also allow environmental technologies and monitoring to be assessed at scales and intensities relevant to real world applications.  The overarching objective of the multidisciplinary research is to characterise high variable environmental technologies and systems with extensive multivariate monitoring. This alongside detailed mechanistic studies contribute to the design and operation codes for improving the performance of environmental technologies. 

 Research using large\-scale pilot plants at the ETFS currently involves industrial collaborations with the regional water utility Southern Water \(SW\) \(G1\) and WPL Ltd \(G3, G4\). Research with SW encompasses several technologies that address their current Research & Development \(R&D\) concerns such as increasing the technological options for phosphorus \(P\) removal from effluents, especially at their hundreds of small waste water treatment plants.  Discharge consents are becoming more strict and commonly used options to mitigate negative environmental impacts at large sites, such as chemical \(ferric\) dosing, pose significant operational challenges at smaller sites, making the same interventions economically unsustainable. A potential alternative is to use granular materials that can remove P from wastewater, utilising mechanisms such as precipitation and adsorption, through passive filters.  A key piece of research with SW has therefore been improving the understanding of the kinetics of phosphorous attachment to these “reactive media” through large\-scale long\-term comparative studies of different media, using real sewage, rather than laboratory simulations \(G2\).  This has highlighted the interaction of uptake rates and ultimate uptake capacity over various flow regimes and hydraulic residence times. This has been augmented by characterisation of deposits using advanced imaging and analysis techniques at the UoP \(XRD, XRF, SEM\-EDAX\) to inform understanding of the mechanisms and potential for nutrient recovery \(R1\).  Some of these materials increase effluent pH, so passive pH correction experiments have also been undertaken to allow these effluents to be released.  Other studies with SW have examined immobilised bacteria for P removal and novel methods for optimising and diagnosing WwTW operations, based on modelling and analysis of historic data to improve treatment performance and inform future treatment requirements \(R2\). 

 Collaborative R&D with WPL has been in operation throughout this REF period \(G3, G4\). WPL Ltd provide a range of products and services to the water sector including  “package” wastewater treatment plants, where a series of processes in one container provide treatment solutions typically used at small WwTP or where mains sewerage is not available. The application of these technologies are deployed around the world in low, middle and high income countries. Their long established submerged aerated filter range has been refined through a series of monitoring full\-scale units installed at the ETFS and operated under modified aeration patterns and various internal configurations.  This has informed the development of numerical models to develop optimised aeration and design strategies to reduce energy use. 

 The group has a >40 year track record of research into blue\-green water technologies in the UK and overseas, particularly focussed on using wetland plants to promote treatment \(R3, R4, R5, R6\).  In addition, our focus on wetlands has extended to Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) and the research at the ETFS has focussed on characterising pollutant removal in vegetated systems. The international consultancy Mott MacDonald and the Highways Agency funded a study of detention ponds to manage flows and treat runoff from trunk roads.  This assessed treatment performance and the fate of metals and hydrocarbons, through intensive multivariate monitoring of field systems. This characterised accumulation rates and speciation of metals that were uncertain at the time and key to long term management and performance \(R4\).  Research into the treatment performance of SuDS in housing developments \(with infrastructure consultancy Mayer Brown Ltd and the Environment Agency\) demonstrated the pollutant removal capacity of swales and vegetated ponds, particularly for metals and hydrocarbons \(G5, G6\).  Following these field studies, modelling studies used computational fluid dynamics to examine how pond geometry can enhance sedimentation, and the understanding of Poly\-cyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon removal rates in swales was enhanced through monitoring a 10m greenhouse model fed with simulated storms mimicking polluted road runoff.  The various economic, policy and social barriers to SuDS uptake in England were investigated in a NERC Green Infrastructure Innovation project, ProSuDS \(R5, G7\), which included evaluation of residents’ perceptions \(R5\).  Studies of hydrocarbon treatment in SuDS have also been extended to phytoremediation studies of contaminated land \(R6, G8\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Introduction** 

 Research undertaken at the ETFS has underpinned the development and application of novel wastewater technologies leading to significant commercial and environmental benefits within the REF period. This impact is demonstrated through five key strands: 

 1.            Improved performance and cost savings for a major UK water company; 

 2.            Influencing national policy for the implementation of SuDS; 

 3.            Economic growth and job creation for UK SMEs; 

 4.            Innovation and new product/service for Kuwaiti energy technology company; 

 5.            Environmental and amenity benefits through strands 2\-4. 

 **Background: Impact through industrial collaboration** 

 A major component of our impact has occurred through collaborative, industrially funded research investigating wastewater treatment mechanisms and performance.  Our research has provided an evidence base for improvements to the performance or efficiency of the technology, essentially underpinned by our research contributions that have led to a more complete understanding of the underlying treatment processes, and also the development of independently assessed evidence that can further support the adoption and commercialisation of the technology.  This is valuable for SME innovators, as the UK wastewater industry is traditionally risk adverse and requires robust evidence before adopting new technologies. 

 **Impact strand 1: Improved performance and cost savings for a major UK company** 

 The University’s long term strategic partnership with Southern Water \(SW\) led to “The Hub” being established at the ETFS in 2017. The University employs 2 dedicated full\-time scientific officers at The Hub to carry out research onsite and act as a bridge to the research expertise and facilities at the University of Portsmouth thus expanding the R&D capacity of SW.  This research has focussed on assessing phosphorus \(P\) removal from effluents, particularly for small WwTP where increasingly tight discharge consents challenge the efficacy and economic viability of conventional technologies.  Southern Water operates 367 WwTW, of which 224 serve <ins><</ins>2,000 people and 136 <ins><</ins>500. Installing the most common P solution, chemical dosing, could cost over GBP100,000 for each site requiring significant investment and increased costs for customers.  A number of technologies have been evaluated to increase SW’s approved list of options, to date this has involved practical research studies into treatment options for P removal such as enhanced dosing/coagulation, electrocoagulation and immobilised bacteria at both the laboratory and pilot plant scales. These studies have resulted in systematic technical reports used by SW in investment decisions and provided design guidance to SW’s Engineering and Technical Services informing in\-house design of WwTP. SW stated: **""Research outcomes and other support provided by The Hub have increased our options to meet future regulations and reduced our reliance on existing, highly expensive, solutions""** \(S1\). Furthermore, data from these and other studies conducted by the team underpinned new models that enabled simple visualisation of stress to wastewater treatment plan informing operation and capacity at WwTW.  This work led SW to a saving of GBP8,500,000 on plans for future investment. SW stated: **“The Hub provided an intensive monitoring campaign, analysis and calibration of modelling to assess process resilience in real time, which provided realised capital benefits of GBP8.5million**” \(S2\). SW has also benefited from the contributions that the publicity, conference presentations and academic papers resulting from the collaboration make to its Public Relations strategy, by demonstrating its commitment and investment in improving environmental performance and process efficiency to customers and regulators \(S2\). 

 **Impact Strand 2: Influencing national policy for the implementation of SuDS** 

 Our research in the use of wetlands and sustainable drainage systems \(SuDS\) has promoted the national use of nature\-based solutions for improving water management; adding to the stock of validated case studies that demonstrate the value of SuDS to policy makers and informing design guidance for pollutant removal.  This influenced the 2006 policy of the Highways Agency \(Design Manual for Roads and Bridges: Vegetated Drainage Systems for Highway Runoff \(DMRB HA 103/06 \(S3\)\), that has seen wider uptake of vegetated SuDS on the road network in the period 2013\-2020 \(S4\). Highways England stated: **“This work influenced our policy and informed past and current practice in relation to road runoff control in vegetated systems. Vegetated detention pond systems are now an integral part of highway design and the runoff management treatment providing enhanced environmental protection for many watercourses.”** Major infrastructure projects in this period \(e.g. A1, A14 improvements\) have included vegetated drainage systems designed in accordance with DMRB HA 103/06. 

 **Impact Strand 3: Economic growth and job creation for SMEs** 

 A number of SMEs have also exploited the research expertise and ETFS test facilities to develop novel package sewage treatment plants and improved performance, and therefore competitiveness of existing products.  The strongest example of this is the long term collaboration with WPL who, in addition to large scale installations for water utilities, provide package sewage treatment plants to homes and communities not connected to the main sewerage network. The company has used the outcomes of research collaboration to develop a novel package technology for sludge management and made several refinements to the design of the aeration systems of the HiPAF Submerged Aerated Filters that have maintained the competitiveness of this well established technology; WPL sell  >50 plants a year ranging in scale from 150 to 1,000 population.  WPL stated: **“The research has supported the growth and economic prosperity of a local SME contributing to over GBP3million of sales and an estimated 20 jobs in the supply chain.” \(S3\).  Another SME, Mayer Brown Ltd, exploited the outcomes of our SuDS research to secure new clients. Our research validated the performance of their vegetated SuDS designs in housing developments. This led to commercial benefits in the form of increased sales in the REF period \(estimated GBP300,000\) \(S5\). 

 **Impact strand 4: Innovative new product/service for Kuwaiti energy technology company** 

 The team developed expertise in green\-blue water technologies for the removal of hydrocarbons \(R6\). This expertise was developed further through a Kuwaiti government funded PhD that developed a novel soil washing technology using bio\-surfactants from natural products and ultrasound. This ex\-student has since patented the process in the US and Gulf States \(US10072469B2 \(S6\) and GC0006708 \(S7\)\).  The technology has been through several stages of scale\-up trials in collaboration with the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research.  The technology has been certified for full\-scale use by the Kuwait Oil Company and has so far remediated a decommissioned oil production facility and a refinery.  The technology is now being applied to other contaminated sites significantly contributing to environmental protection \(S8\). 

 **Impact strand 5:** **Environmental and amenity benefits** 

 In addition to the commercial and policy benefits there is a significant environmental benefit arising from the implementation of the technologies described in impact strands \(IS\) 2 to 4: SuDS built to design standard DMRB HA 103/06 in the period \(IS2\), small\-scale WwTP installed by WPL Ltd \(IS3\), and the two field sites for the novel hydrocarbon remediation \(IS4\). Benefits are reduced pollution, and enhanced ecological and amenity quality in natural water bodies.
