#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Brexit required the UK to have a new Agricultural Policy in place in preparation for departure from the European Union. The University of Nottingham’s \(UoN’s\) research \(2004\-2020\) into agricultural business management, agri\-environment interactions and sustainable intensification, combined with leadership \(2004\-present\) of the Farm Business Survey \(FBS\) for England, **delivered 49% of the evidence base that supported development of the new Agriculture Act 2020**. UoN **directly influenced agriculture policymaking** through research outputs and actions that enabled **Defra evidenced\-based policymaking** and facilitated understanding of key issues by policymakers, government and industry stakeholders via a range of knowledge exchange activities.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 **Overview** 

 Since 2004, the University of Nottingham \(UoN\) has led a consortium encompassing six specialist research teams within English Universities \(Nottingham, Cambridge, Reading, Newcastle\) and Colleges \(Askham Byran, Duchy\). Under Professor Wilson’s research leadership the consortium \(Rural Business Research; RBR\) has developed research methodologies and data collection and analytical approaches, and also delivered databases of national importance plus research reports, to Government within the competitively awarded Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\) funded Farm Business Survey \(FBS\) Research Programme for England. The FBS is the main source of data and intelligence on the economic performance of farm businesses in England. Over 1,750 farm businesses \(approximately 3% of English farms\) take part in the survey to provide detailed insights to Government representing the annual production, financial performance and productivity change of approximately 60,000 commercial English farm businesses. Farm businesses within the FBS sample are stratified by type, size and regional location; a range of information is collected, including data on management practices, agricultural production levels \(e.g. crop yields\), sales, costs, investments \(e.g. in buildings, machinery and livestock\) and support \(e.g. subsidy\) payments. The FBS data are used by DEFRA to develop and analyse the impact of agricultural policies and by researchers. The information has also been used in FBS linked applied agricultural and economic research projects by UoN’s Professor Paul Wilson and Dr Stephen Ramsden. These research projects on environmental and economic trade\-offs have identified opportunities for farmers to simultaneously increase productivity and reduce Greenhouse Gas \(GHG\) emissions through benchmarking approaches that demonstrate opportunities for farmers to reduce input use without large impact on yields. A further study analysed the influence of different farmer objectives, management practices and farm business performance that generated new insights into the link between farm management practice and performance. The FBS and other research programmes have together delivered key outputs that have underpinned the development of new evidenced\-based UK agriculture legislation and policy required for the UK’s exit from the European Union \(EU\). 

 **DEFRA\-funded Farm Business Survey \(FBS\) Research Programme** 

 As an individual researcher, chair of DEFRA’s FBS Technical Group \(2006\-\) and lead of the FBS research grant \(2009\-\) **\(G1,G2\)**, Professor Paul Wilson has undertaken, led and co\-developed a range of research methodologies and approaches in agricultural economics. These include developing research protocols for allocating whole business fixed costs across individual business cost centres **\(1\)**; comprehensive analyses of agricultural labour use in English and Welsh agriculture **\(2\)**, and; analysis of agricultural enterprise gross and net margin cost sharing **\(3\)**. These research outputs and protocols underpin the FBS research programme that delivers the highly regarded independent datasets to DEFRA **\(4\)**. These annual datasets are recognised by industry and Government as being of national and international importance. Specifically, and of direct relevance for this impact case study, the data on farm business physical performance \(e.g. crop yields\) and financial performance \(e.g. farm income\) have been extensively used within the evidence base for the development of new agricultural policy legislation in England \(Agriculture Act 2020\) that was required given the UK’s departure from the EU and the Common Agricultural Policy \(CAP\). 

 **Understanding Environmental and Economic Trade Offs In Agriculture** 

 Drawing on FBS data, Ramsden developed environmental\-economic optimisation modelling approaches to determine farm\-level adaptations to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions. The FBS linked research identified a range of farm management practices \(changes in land use, etc\) that could achieve relatively large reductions in GHG emissions at low financial cost to farmers. Importantly, from a policy perspective, certain management practices were found to be associated with least\-cost reductions in GHG emissions **\(5\)**. The recommended good practices from the research, were found to be robust and representative across different farm types **\(5\)**. Building on **\(5\)** that identified considerable uncertainty in GHG emissions across individual farms within a single ‘farm type’, research funded under DEFRA’s flagship Sustainable Intensification Platform \(SIP\) **\(G3\)** identified opportunities for farmers to simultaneously increase productivity and reduce environmental damage. Drawing on FBS data from representative dairy and cereal farms, the FBS linked research demonstrated the considerable variation that exists in GHG emissions per unit of product. Accordingly, this SIP research identified opportunities for using benchmarking techniques to improve resource use across farms, in particular through optimised use of fertilisers and ‘concentrate’ animal feeds **\(6\)**. 

 **Understanding Behavioural Drivers In Agriculture** 

 Recognising that farmers often have differing objectives affecting why, how and when they make business decisions, Wilson used DEFRA's farm behavioural segmentation approach to analyse the relationship between ‘segmentation groups’, farm management practices and the associated physical and financial business outcomes of these segmentation groups. This FBS linked research that drew on a sample of 750 farm business owners and managers identified a need for targeted development and implementation of agricultural policies to account for different farm business behavioural drivers **\(7\)**. Further research **\(8\)** funded under DEFRA’s SIP **\(G4\)**, acknowledged the importance of behavioural drivers in decision making and explicitly analysed farmers’ business management practices alongside their farm business performance \(income\); this identified that farmers who achieved higher profit were more likely to have undertaken environmental monitoring and management practices. They were also significantly more likely to have obtained further or higher education and to draw upon independent technical and business management advice. A specific output of the SIP report to DEFRA **\(8\)** from this research was that Government should invest in encouraging farmer uptake of business benchmarking. 

 **Research Summary** 

 As the UK prepared to leave the EU, UoN’s leadership of the FBS research programme, and FBS linked research conducted by Wilson and Ramsden, have generated research outputs and datasets that provided **direct evidence that informed the development of new UK agriculture legislation and policy**.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Following departure from the European Union \(EU\) at the end of the Brexit transition period \(31<sup>st</sup> December 2020\), UK agriculture now operates outside of the Common Agricultural Policy \(CAP\). Consequently, UK government has developed new domestic agricultural legislation \(Agriculture Act 2020\) and outlined policies \(The Path to Sustainable Farming: An Agricultural Transition Plan 2020\-2024\) that replaced the CAP from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2021. Independent evidence underpins UK government policy frameworks and, specifically, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\) draws upon evidence from economic, social and operational research to address key questions facing agriculture. The UoN\-led FBS research programme and UoN’s FBS linked research have directly informed the development of the new agriculture legislation and policy. 

 **FBS and UoN Research Provided an Extensive Evidence Base** 

 The Agricultural Bill 2019\-20 **\(a\)** was announced in the Queen’s Speech on 19<sup>th</sup> December 2019. It was given its First Reading on 16<sup>th</sup> January 2020 and received Royal Assent on 11<sup>th</sup> November 2020, becoming the “Agriculture Act 2020”. In line with other Parliamentary Acts, the Agriculture Act 2020 does not directly cite research but is supported by evidence collated from broad analysis and consultation. The Act is supported by two evidence packs **\(b,c\)** that drew heavily upon FBS data **\(4\)**; an updated evidence compendium **\(d\)** extensively utilising FBS data **\(4\)**; and UoN’s SIP reports to DEFRA **\(6,8\)**. The value of the FBS and Professor Wilson’s expertise was recognised by the DEFRA FBS team leader, who stated: 

 *“Specifically, without the FBS it would not have been possible to provide the depth of understanding and impact analyses that were produced within two evidence compendiums that support the \[Agriculture Act 2020\]”* **\(e\)** 

 In total UoN\-led and co\-produced research datasets and outputs, **provided 49% of the evidence that supported the development of the Agriculture Act 2020** **that was** **required upon the UK’s departure from the EU** \(Table 1\).

| **Percentage FBS/SIP** | 68% | 47% | 43% | **49%** |

 **Informing Agricultural Transition Arrangements** 

 The Agriculture Act 2020, provides enabling powers for ministers to develop new approaches to farm support. Direct payments to farmers, in the form of Basic Payment Schemes \(BPS\) are currently based on the area of land farmed. This form of direct payment will be phased out in England between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2027. This seven\-year agricultural transition arrangement acknowledges the reliance of many farm businesses on the BPS. The underlying data that demonstrated the reliance of key farm types on the BPS **\(d\)** were taken directly from the UoN\-led FBS datasets **\(4\)**. 

 **Increasing Agricultural Productivity** 

 The Agriculture Act 2020 makes provision for the collection and sharing of data to ‘increase productivity’ while ‘The Path to Sustainable Farming: An Agricultural Transition Plan 2020\-2024’ notes that Government will “ *Bring forward industry recommendations to improve the training offer to farmers and increase the use of business benchmarking*” **\(f, pg.61\)**. The UoN\-led FBS provides a free to use  [farm business benchmarking service](http://www.farmbusinesssurvey.co.uk/), developed and hosted by \(Rural Business Research; RBR\) consortium partners at Cambridge University. This benchmarking service has a user volume of approximately 47,000 visits per annum, totalling approximately 970,000 hits. Professor Wilson presented information on this free benchmarking service to the Agri\-Food Council **\(April 2016\)**, a decision\-making group that included representatives from primary production, processing and retail sectors, and DEFRA ministers and civil servants. This meeting raised awareness of the simple to use, free service and the benefits for users. Recognising the need to understand farmer behaviour factors as a driver for business decision making, Professor Wilson’s SIP report to DEFRA **\(8\)** identified that farmers who achieved higher profits were more likely to have obtained further or higher education and also use business management advice. Furthermore, the report **\(8\)** recommended investing in enhancing managerial capacity through encouraging farmer uptake of business benchmarking. Professor Wilson also presented to a House of Lords Rural Economy Research Group **\(October 2015\)**, and provided written and verbal contributions to a House of Lords EU Energy and Environment Sub Committee enquiry examining Price Volatility and Agricultural Business Resilience **\(December 2015\)**, explicitly noting the importance of government supporting farm business benchmarking in increasing agricultural productivity. The resultant Lords report **\(g\)** cites Professor Wilson 8 times, Rural Business Research 8 times, and FBS results 7 times, including: 

 “*A key determining factor of farm performance is the management ability of those individual farm businesses. Anything that allows farmers to access greater information \- for example, benchmarking \[…will help to\] achieve a successful business.”* \[pg 52, para 259\]. This statement was supported in the report with FBS data *: “the 2011/12 Farm Business Survey showed that 15% of farmers who frequently benchmark at whole farm level achieved an average Farm Business Income of £128,900 in contrast with £63,000 for the 85% of farmers that did not benchmark*” **\(g, pg.52, para 258\)**. 

 One of the key recommendations in the Lords report was that: 

 “*Benchmarking in agriculture should be promoted among the farming community and encouraged by the UK Government. \[…\] Farmers should share their data with their peers to facilitate this benchmarking*.” **\(g, pg.52, para 261\)**. 

 The importance of benchmarking was recognised in DEFRA’s ‘Farming for the future: Policy and progress update’ in February 2020, stating “ *the use of farm business data for benchmarking \(comparing the performance of similar businesses\) is accepted across all industries as essential to driving performance and efficiency*” **\(h, pg.27\)**. Moreover, ‘The Path to Sustainable Farming: An Agricultural Transition Plan 2020\-2024’  notes that “ *We will work with the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board and the Agricultural Productivity Working Groups* \[APWG\] *Key Performance Indicators sub\-group to create a consistent set of indicators for farm businesses to capture key financial performance and sustainability outcomes*” **\(f, pg.62\)**.  Following a personal invitation from the Chair of the APWG, Professor Wilson joined the APWG working group developing these potential key performance indicators. Building upon UoN’s SIP reports to DEFRA **\(6,8\)** a Sustainable Intensification \(SI\) benchmarking tool \(focused on environmental and social data\) was developed in conjunction with Cambridge University **\(G4\)**. A series of 10 knowledge exchange workshops were held with farmers, advisors and consultants from across England and Wales, to demonstrate the  [SIP benchmarking tool](https://www.benchmarkmyfarm.co.uk/) \(environmental and social\) and  [FBS benchmarking tool](http://www.farmbusinesssurvey.co.uk/) \(business management\) \[47,642 ‘visits’ / 971,897 ‘hits’ 2019\-20\] **\(i\)**. A  [webinar tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqx2Vys9IKY) was also developed \[216 views\]. 

 **Summary** 

 In summary, the UoN\-led FBS research programme, and specifically its highly regarded independent data sets, and FBS linked applied agricultural and economic research outputs, provided an extensive evidence base for the development of new domestic agriculture legislation and policy, following the UK’s exit from the EU. Facilitating the use of UoN research outputs in policy development, a range of knowledge exchange activities have also been undertaken. Professor Wilson and Dr Ramsden’s research and UoN delivery of the FBS programme have been recognised by DEFRA as of crucial importance to their agricultural policy development process, commenting *“the FBS data and intelligence reports provided by RBR have \[…\] enabled us to create policies that will have positive impacts on the whole of UK agriculture upon the UK’s exit from the EU. Professor Wilson’s input via leadership of the FBS has been invaluable with regards to highlighting important issues in the current farming business landscape and how these can be addressed through policies in the \[Agriculture Act 2020\].”* **\(e\)**

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The implications of Christian theology and ethics for human relationships with the more\-than\-human world is a pressing current question, with relevance for Christian thinking about the current climate crisis, the current anthropogenic mass extinction of wild animals, the growth of industrialized animal agriculture, and the intersections with human health, food and water security, poverty, sexism, and racism. David Clough’s research on non\-human animals is an internationally leading contribution to this research area. His focus on addressing the human use of animals for food connects with a growing public awareness about the environmental impacts of food. 

 Clough’s two\-volume monograph *On Animals* has been widely recognized as a landmark contribution to consideration of the place of animals in Christian theology and ethics. Volume 1, *Systematic Theology* \(2012\) deconstructs theological rationales for considering humans to be the sole or primary object of God’s care, and argues that Christians have reason to recognize core theological principles that affirm the place of other animals as fellow creatures of God, fellow recipients of God’s reconciling work in Jesus Christ, and fellow participants in Christian visions of the new creation. A key implication of this analysis is that Christians have strong faith\-based reasons to be concerned about animals. Volume 2, *Theological Ethics* \(2019\) assesses the implications of this Christian understanding of animals for the human treatment of animals today for food, textiles, labour, research experimentation, sport and entertainment, pets and companion animals, and human impacts on wild animals. The key finding of Volume 2 is that the use humans make of other animals for food is by far the most urgent ethical issue to address for reasons of scale, intensity, and scope of impacts. 

 The key findings from this research that Christians have strong faith\-based reasons for being concerned about animals and that the human use of animals for food is priority concern led to two clear action points for policy and practice: the need to reduce consumption of animal products and move to sources of higher welfare animal products. 

 David Clough joined the University of Chester as Senior Lecturer in September 2007, was appointed as Professor of Theological Ethics in 2009, and remains in post. Animals has been the main focus of his research activity throughout this period. His research for *On Animals* took place between 2007 and 2019. It incorporates engagement with Christian theological texts, biblical scholarship, scientific perspectives on animals, contemporary animal studies, animal ethics, and statistical data relating to the human use of animals. To supplement accounts of human practice in relation to animals in the literature, his research for Volume 2 included visits to farms, slaughterhouses, laboratories, and racing stables.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

### 1.  Creation of the new US non\-profit organization CreatureKind \(2015–2020\) \(B5\-1\) 

 The first impact of Clough’s research is the creation of a new US non\-profit organization. Clough founded the organization CreatureKind in 2015 with a partner in the US specifically to engage an audience outside the academy with the key findings of his two\-volume *On Animals* monograph: that Christians have faith\-based reasons to be concerned about other animals, and that practical action in relation to the use of animals for food is the top priority. CreatureKind’s key strategies derive directly from Clough’s research: focussing on farmed animal issues and seeking to engage a broad and diverse Christian audience with arguments engaging in depth with Christian theology and ethics. Since 2015, CreatureKind has worked in the UK and North America to engage churches, theological colleges and seminaries, universities with Christian foundations, and other Christian institutions with farmed animal welfare as a faith issue. It is the first Christian organization to focus on the consumption of animals and farmed animal welfare. From 2015–2019 it worked in partnership with Eastern University in Philadelphia and the non\-profit organization Farm Forward as fiscal sponsors, but it incorporated as an independent non\-profit organization in the US in February 2020. By December 2020 it had been awarded $749,000 in funding and had grown to employ one full\-time and two half\-time staff members alongside part\-time contractors. Alertness to intersectional issues and diversity has been a key organizational value throughout. The inaugural board of 10 has 5 women and 5 people of colour; Clough has transitioned from co\-director to co\-president of the Board alongside an African American woman, and CreatureKind’s co\-directors are now two women, one of whom is Latinx. CreatureKind has a website with a blog that has been actively updated since February 2016, and social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Its website attracted 91K page views in the period 2015–2020, and it has 2400 followers on Facebook, 813 on Twitter, and 491 on Instagram. In addition to the impact of creating this new non\-profit organization, CreatureKind work in the three key areas of education, institutional engagement, and community have each had their own impacts, which are outlined in sections 2\(a\)–2\(c\) below. 

1.  **Changes in Christian attitudes and practice through the activities of CreatureKind and influence on books and periodicals for a popular Christian audience** 

###  2\(a\) Impact on attitudes and practice via CreatureKind educational programme \(2016–2020\) 

 CreatureKind’s educational strategy is strongly informed by Clough’s research and has had three main foci: a course for church groups and speaking events and media interviews by Clough. 

-  The six\-session course on Christianity and animals includes video presentations, resources for study of biblical and theological texts, a leader’s guide, and publicity resources. It has been available since May 2017 from the CreatureKind website, and has been downloaded 521 times. In online feedback from a group of 20 participants in the course, all respondents who were not already vegetarian or vegan reported their intention to reduce consumption of animal products, with 6 committed to stop consuming animal products entirely \(B5\-1\). 

-  Interest in Clough’s *On Animals* has resulted in speaking invitations at over 40 universities and seminaries between 2016 and July 2020 to address Christian reasons for rethinking the consumption of animals. International demand led to a 2019 book tour that included 5 weeks in North America and a month in Australia and New Zealand. The combined audience for these tour events was over 1500. 86% of respondents to a post\-event audience questionnaire not already vegetarian or vegan agreed that the event had made a difference for their attitudes towards animals and 77% agreed that it would make a difference for their food choices \(B5\-1\). 

-  An extensive range of broadcast and podcast interviews in the UK, North America, Australia, and New Zealand has enabled Clough to influence the attitudes and practice of wider audiences: UCB Radio interview on Christianity and Animals \(UK, February 2019\), BBC Radio 4’s ‘Beyond Belief’ on Veganism \(UK, May 2019\), ‘On the Way’ podcast \(Australia, June 2019\), ‘Department of Conversation’ podcast \(New Zealand, June 2019\), ‘Our Henhouse’ podcast \(US, June 2019\), ‘The Good Earth’ podcast \(Australia, June 2019\), ABC Radio’s ‘Soul Search’ \(Australia, July 2019\); ‘Panpsycast’ podcast \(UK, February 2020\). Clough was interviewed about his AHRC\-funded Christian Ethics of Farmed Animal Welfare project for Premier Christian Radio and BBC Radio Merseyside in July 2018 and on BBC Radio 4’s Sunday Programme in 2020. He has also published blogs for non\-academic audiences: The Vegan Society published Clough’s blog ‘Should Christians Be Vegan’ in January 2019; ABC Religion and Ethics in Australia published an article based on his book tour lecture ‘Should Christians eat animals? The challenge of Christian animal ethics’ in June 2019, and he regularly publishes blogs on the CreatureKind website. 

###  2\(b\) Impact on practice via CreatureKind institutional programme \(2015–2020\) 

 Since 2016 CreatureKind has worked with Christian seminaries, theological colleges, universities, and other Christian organizations about implementing strategies to reduce consumption of animal products, move to higher welfare sourcing, and consider wider implications of attending to animals such as in their curriculum. The University of Winchester, Friends’ House in Euston, and Regents Theological College became formal CreatureKind partners in 2016, 2017, and 2020 respectively. In the 3\-year period from 2016\-2019, the University of Winchester achieved significant reductions in consumption of animal products, reducing carbon emissions by 14% or 345 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub> annually. They have decided to eliminate beef entirely, which will achieve further reductions of 3,387 kg of beef and 89 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> annually \(B5\-2\). Following their decision to partner with CreatureKind, Friends’ House decided to make their restaurant entirely vegetarian. CreatureKind has been in discussion with over 60 other institutions in the UK and US about food policy. Impacts of this work cannot yet be quantified in the same way, but many of these institutions are reviewing catering policy and considering implementing changes \(B5\-1\). 

###  2\(c\) Impact on attitudes and practice via CreatureKind community programme \(2015–2020\) 

 CreatureKind has responded to a need to resource individual church leaders or church members who want to influence their churches but are unsure about how and often feel isolated. In 2019 CreatureKind held a two\-day retreat for vegan women attended by 8 people. Since 2019, CreatureKind has held two monthly conference calls for church leaders and church members interested in sharing experiences with others. 33 clergy and 81 animal advocates have participated. CreatureKind has also hosted two interns, an MDiv student from Columbia Theological Seminary and an undergraduate from Eastern University, each of whom have worked on projects within their own institutions and helped with other CreatureKind project work, and in 2020 launched a student fellowship programme resourcing and mentoring students in a range of contexts to undertake projects relating to CreatureKind’s mission. The first year’s cohort consists of 7 students from three countries representing 6 different denominations \(B5\-1\). 

###  2\(d\) Impact on attitudes via books and periodicals for a popular Christian audience \(2019–2020\) 

-  In 2019 Michael Leyden, published *Faithful Living: Discipleship, Creed, and* Ethics \(SCM, 2019\) with a chapter on food and animals drawing on Clough’s research and commending both CreatureKind and DefaultVeg as resources for Christian action. As Director of St Mellitus North West he also oversaw the college adoption of the DefaultVeg policy. 

-  The Archbishop of Canterbury’s 2020 Lent Book is Ruth Valerio’s *Saying Yes to Life* \(SPCK, 2019\). Valerio affirms Christian reasons for concern for animals and makes connections with dietary choices. She credits Clough as ‘a significant influence on my thinking about Christianity and animals’, devotes a chapter of the book to human relationships with animals, and quotes from *On Animals* in that chapter. The book had sold over 18,000 copies by December 2020 and is the most successful ever Church of England Lent Book. It was studied by many church Lent groups, and was used as the basis of the Church of England’s ‘Live Lent: Care for God’s Creation campaign’ including a study guide, app, and online resources. ‘Humans and Other Animals’ is the topic of Week 6 of the campaign, and resources make connections with consumption of animals. The ‘Live Lent’ campaign was the most successful ever Church of England Lent campaign. Valerio also reports that Clough’s research ‘continues to influence my public engagement work with Tear Fund, in talking about concern for animals in a Christian context and the implications for dietary choices’ \(B5\-3\). 

-  In its 22<sup>nd</sup> May 2020 issue the *Church Times* ran a full\-page feature on Clough titled ‘Should Christians eat less meat?’ \(p. 18\) which quoted Canon Andrew Davison, Starbridge Lecturer in Theology and Natural Sciences at Cambridge University, saying of Clough ‘He has brought the topic of animals into the mainstream of theological study. His work is both rigorously scholarly and enormously effective. It has the sort of impact on public policy and human behaviour that academics can usually only dream of’ \(B5\-4\). 

###  3. Impact on organizational policy through the DefaultVeg campaign encouraging organizations in the UK and US to adopt default plant\-based catering \(2017–2020\) 

 One of the key conclusions of Clough’s research was the need to reduce consumption of animal products. One of the strategies CreatureKind developed to effect this was to encourage organizations to make their catering plant\-based by default while allowing those who wished to eat animal products to request them. This successfully reduced consumption without triggering resistance on the basis of reducing choice. Since the initiative had appeal beyond a Christian constituency, Clough approached the Better Food Foundation to promote the initiative in the US \(http://defaultveg.org\) and was approached by the Vegetarian Society about taking it up in the UK as part of their ‘Eat to Beat Climate Change’ campaign. By December 2020, the DefaultVeg campaign had persuaded 38 organizations to adopt its catering policy, ranging from UK academic societies and university faculties to US NGOs and conference organizers. The combined commitment of these adopters represents 74,400 meals per year which achieves average reductions in demand for animal products equivalent to 1600 animals, 72,000 kg CO<sub>2</sub> in greenhouse gas emissions, and 10 million litres of water \(B5\-5\). 

###  4. Impact on policy and practice of partner organizations \(2016–2020\) 

###  4\(a\) A Rocha UK 

 Eco Church is an awards scheme run by Arocha UK enabling churches to help reflect care for God’s creation in their practice. It has been running for 5 years and now has 3100 churches registered with over 1000 having qualified for awards. Arocha UK contacted Clough to draft the Eco Church material on animals and food, which led to consumption of animals becoming a stronger element within the programme. The Eco Church resource guide points users to CreatureKind for further help \(B5\-3\). 

###  4\(b\) Green Seminaries Initiative \(GSI\) 

 GSI run a certification programme for seminaries in the US, encouraging an environmental audit and action plan to improve their sustainability. They run regular conferences and webinars for the 10 seminaries in their certification programme and the many more seminaries registered with them. In 2019 CreatureKind and GSI signed a partnership agreement to collaborate on food policy. Prof. Lauren Kearns, GSI co\-founder, reports ‘this partnership has resulted in farmed animal welfare and reducing the consumption of animals becoming a more significant focus within the GSI framework, the production and distribution of more resources for seminaries to take action, and changed food policies and actions at a range of theological schools’ \(B5\-6\). 

###  4\(c\) AHRC\-funded Christian Ethics of Farmed Animal Welfare project 

 In 2017 Clough was awarded £458K by the AHRC as PI on a project on the Christian ethics of farmed animal welfare. A key part of the rationale for the project was the argument made in Clough’s *On Animals* that Christians should give attention to the welfare of animals with farmed animals as the most urgent priority for action. The project has 14 institutional partners including major UK churches \(Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church in Wales, Methodist Church, Roman Catholic Church, United Reformed Church\) and other Christian organisations including the Church Investors Group. Each partner organization committed in\-kind resources of at least 2 days of staff time per year to participate in the project. Gaining this level of participation from church partners for a project on farmed animal welfare is itself an impact on their activity. The project was designed from the start to enable impact on organizational policy. Alongside academic outputs, a key part of the project is developing and encouraging the implementation of a policy framework for churches and Christian organizations. This 60\-page report was completed and launched in November 2020 together with a short animated video introducing the project. The launch was reported in detail by the *Methodist Recorder* across its front page and onto page 2, covered in an article in *The Tablet,* and in an item on BBC Radio 4’s Sunday Programme. By the end of December 2020, the Policy Framework had been downloaded 190 times in PDF format and 192 print copies had been sent out on request \(B5\-7\). Partner churches are now considering its implications for policy at a national and local level.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Effective news coverage of humanitarian crises plays a vital role in enabling the response of the international community: but due to financial pressures, humanitarian news is in crisis. Dr Scott’s research contributed directly to journalistic and organisational policy changes made at **The New Humanitarian** \( **TNH**, previously IRIN\), the largest non\-profit, humanitarian news outlet in the world. Scott and his team helped TNH improve the focus, relevance, and impact of its coverage in order to promote more informed and accountable humanitarian action. After inviting Scott to help re\-evaluate their editorial strategy, TNH increased its investigative journalism, expanded local expert analysis, decreased European stories, and offered more coverage of climate change and global health issues. It is clear from their feedback that this revised strategy has helped aid organisations around the world – TNH’s main audience – deliver more needs\-based, context\-specific and accountable humanitarian responses, directly benefitting those affected by crises. 

  
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 News coverage of humanitarian affairs plays a vital role in highlighting the plight of those caught up in large\-scale crises and promoting effective responses by the international community. This is crucial journalistic work at a time when levels of humanitarian funding have not kept pace with the requirements of countries needing aid. Over 109 million people in 53 countries are in need of humanitarian assistance, yet UN humanitarian responses plans have, on average, been only 61% funded since 2010. This lack of funding has life\-and\-death consequences for many thousands of people. For instance, in February 2020, a funding shortfall forced the World Food Programme to cut food rations for around one million people in Yemen, despite growing chronic hunger. 

 Unfortunately, news coverage of humanitarian crises is itself in crisis. As one of the least profitable and most costly forms of journalism to produce, very few news outlets regularly report on these important issues. As the largest non\-profit, humanitarian news outlet in the world, The New Humanitarian \(TNH\) plays a major role in shaping humanitarian stories within global news coverage. Its content is regularly republished by influential news outlets such as the *Huffington Post, The Guardian*, and *The Los Angeles Times*. TNH’s main audience are aid sector professionals at international charities \(INGOs\), the United Nations, and national governments \( **5.1**\). Over 60% of its audience have ‘some’ or a ‘significant’ amount of decision\-making authority in those organisations with a majority \(53%\) of INGO and UN executive management staff describing the service as ‘important’ or ‘very important’ to their work \( **5.1**\). 

 Already aware of Scott’s research expertise on its news coverage and journalistic practices, TNH invited him \(and his project research team\) to recommend improvements to the relevance, impact, and economic sustainability of its humanitarian journalism \( **3.1\-3.5**\). This was necessary, in part, due to TNH’s funding challenges: its reliance on donor support potentially made it more difficult to report critically on the aid sector. TNH has continued to stress its independence, even at the cost of losing its financial support from the UN in 2015 \(over an editorial dispute\) – and was eager for an external research perspective on its options. 

 Scott and his team have researched the production, content, and funding of humanitarian news over the past five years, involving multiple newsroom observations, surveys of aid workers, and interviews with approximately 200 journalists, news managers, and media donors \( **3.1\-3.5**\). Funded primarily by a grant from the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) \( **3.6**\), phase one of their research was a yearlong study \( **3.1**\) of the journalistic practices and news coverage of TNH as it moved from UN\-backing to private foundation funding. The research addressed previously under\-researched questions about the sustainability of humanitarian journalism and the consequences of different funding models. Scott’s research compared TNH’s coverage, content, and production practices before and after accepting foundation funding through a twelve\-month content analysis of TNH and nine other humanitarian news producers \(including Al Jazeera English, the BBC World Service, and Reuters\). This research is the first and only in\-depth case study of either foundation\-funded journalism or a specialist humanitarian news outlet \( **3.1**\). 

 Scott’s research showed that pursuing and maintaining foundation funding did exert some influence on TNH, via a combination of revenue expectations and the need to satisfy the different norms and values of journalism, humanitarianism, and philanthrocapitalism. Scott specifically identified three key issues in his research that had an impact on TNH \( **3.1**\): 

1.  **Content:** The dual pressures to maximise audience reach, and to focus on issues which could appeal to non\-specialist audiences, had led to a substantial increase in TNH’s coverage of Europe and a lack of coverage of climate change and global health. This geographic and thematic shift might undermine the organisation’s ability to draw international attention to neglected issues and crises. 

1.  **Sources:** The change in TNH’s revenue model had affected its sourcing practices, which led to a decline in the use of ‘local experts’ as sources. Scott’s team recommended TNH rectify this by incorporating more local, expert voices by, for example, making greater use of freelancers. 

1.  **Investigative role:** The research emphasised the scope for TNH to increase investigative reporting to better promote transparency and accountability to the aid sector. After the UN relationship ended, TNH had adopted a limited ‘watchdog’ role, with the percentage of TNH’s outputs that qualified as ‘investigative’ seeing only a marginal increase \(from 4% to 6.5%\). Scott’s research also noted this was a unique opportunity, given the lack of investigative coverage by TNH’s competitors.

 4. Details of the impact 

 News coverage of humanitarian crises is vital in enabling the international community to understand, respond to, and avert such emergencies. It is also crucial in determining levels of public support for humanitarian aid. But it is facing a growing economic crisis, with news organisations covering international affairs facing an ‘extinction event’ in many countries. In short, humanitarian news is in crisis, just when it is needed most. 

 This has long made The New Humanitarian \(TNH\) the key media news source for those working in policymaking for, and providing assistance to, the many millions of people across the world needing humanitarian support and protection. This unique reporting responsibility has weighed heavily on the agenda: its previous close relationship with the UN reportedly led to a more constrained reporting style. In 2015/16, TNH and its audience of aid workers, recognised the need for a shift in strategy. 

 **Shaping A New Strategy for Humanitarian News Reporting at TNH** 

 Scott and his colleagues were invited to contribute to a thorough re\-evaluation of TNH’s editorial strategy after it shifted to a new business model. Scott presented research findings and recommendations to TNH’s senior management \(May 2016\); gave a wider presentation to all TNH staff and management \(August 2016 annual staff meeting, Geneva\); and produced two 2016 internal reports for TNH detailing the results of his analysis of their outputs, which were discussed with TNH’s management, staff, and board members. 

 **“Dr. Martin Scott’s analysis of TNH’s output has helped us better understand ourselves ... At several instances, his findings have fed into internal reviews of our positioning and where our added value lies. It has provided additional data with which to make decisions around strategy”** \(5.1: TNH Director\).** 

 Those strategic decisions saw significant change in three areas: 

1.  Reversing the shift to locations and issues with greater appeal to non\-specialist audiences \(such as Europe\): this re\-established TNH’s credentials for covering pressing issues and existential crises \(including climate change\) \( **5.2**\). 

1.  Reversing the decline in the use of ‘local voices’ as sources: this recognised the crucial role that local knowledge and expertise can play in heightening awareness and facilitating humanitarian action \( **5.2**\). 

1.  Strengthening TNH’s ‘watchdog’ role, and the increase of its ‘investigative’ reporting to 17% of its output \( **5.2**\). 

 In essence, TNH’s readjustment of its geographic and thematic focus was directly influenced by Scott’s research findings and this readjustment had a direct effect on humanitarian actors’ ability to respond to crises, based on objectively identified needs. 

 **‘‘Martin’s research ... did force us to think … \[we\] tried to rein back in some of the Europe coverage … \[it also made us\] realise how little we covered issues like health, climate change and economy ... Since then, we have certainly made a considered effort to increase the coverage on those themes**” \(5.1: TNH Director\).** 

 Content analysis shows that TNH did ‘rein back’ reporting on Europe, declining from 12% \(2015\) to 7% \(2017\). Equally, TNH’s revised editorial strategy led to significant increases in coverage of ‘Weather and Climate’ from 2% to 10% across the same period \( **5.2**\). 

 The impact on TNH’s output has been deep and sustained. TNH’s 2019 ‘theory of change’ cites the findings of Scott’s team as justification for its focus reflecting the needs, opinions, and proposed solutions of those most affected by crises \( **5.3**\). Moreover, a 2018 survey of TNH’s audience \( **5.4**\), carried out by the marketing agency Media Cause \(1626 respondents\), showed these fundamental shifts in TNH’s reporting strategy and outputs had been noticed and welcomed by TNH’s audience, as is discussed below. 

 **Impacts on TNH’s Audience: The Aid Sector** 

 The scope and content of TNH’s humanitarian reporting has a significant influence on decision\-making processes of humanitarian actors, who require timely and accurate information to respond objectively to identified needs in crises. The continued impact from Scott’s involvement in TNH content and editorial strategy on the aid sector can be categorised in the following four ways: 

1.  **Focusing the Attention of Humanitarian Actors on Forgotten Crises, Leading to Action** 

 TNH’s shift in geographic and thematic coverage helped them to better serve the humanitarian sector by investing more in their traditional core strengths. A significant majority of their readers think that TNH now covers issues \(72%\) and locations \(64%\) that other news agencies fail to. 

 **“TNH covers stories from ‘forgotten’ places, and offers a critical voice to those most impacted by conflict and war”** \(5.4: 2018 survey respondent\).** 

 The increases in TNH’s coverage of health and climate change were particularly welcomed, as survey respondents described these as amongst the most ‘useful’ topics to cover \( **5.4**\). For example, TNH’s reporting on the ‘overlooked’ March 2018 Yazidi healthcare crisis in Iraq prompted immediate action from the UN migration agency, Doctors Without Borders, and others **\(5.5.a\)**. By the end of the year, the main hospital serving the Yazidi minority had acquired several ambulances and moved to better premises \( **5.5.b**\). 

1.  **Enhancing the Knowledge Base for Needs\-Based Humanitarian Responses** 

 The proportion of ‘local experts’ cited in TNH’s coverage doubled between 2015 and 2017 **\(5.2\)** and the audience survey showed that 40% of respondents noticed an increase in the extent of local ‘expert analyses’ \( **5.4**\). 

 **“\[Dr Scott\] noted that we don’t have a lot of experts ... cited in our stories … That led to discussions at the board \[that\] we need to make a considered effort to increase the percentage \[of\], ideally local, analysts and experts we consult”** \(5.1: TNH Director\).** 

 TNH’s increased emphasis on local, expert analysis has helped humanitarian professionals adopt policies and practices that address the most pressing challenges in faraway crises. 60% of respondents said TNH offers expert analysis and opinions unavailable elsewhere \( **5.4**: 2018 survey\). 

 **“TNH informs our understanding of field realities and policy debates and helps us assess how well our donor funds are spent”** \(5.6: Valentin Zellweger, Swiss Ambassador to the UN in Genera\).** 

1.  **Promoting Greater Transparency and Accountability Across the Humanitarian Sector** 

 Dr Scott’s research also ‘validated’ \( **5.1**\) TNH’s increased focus on providing greater transparency and accountability in the humanitarian sector. Between 2015 and 2017, the number of TNH outputs in the form of ‘investigative’ or ‘campaigning’ journalism increased significantly from 6% to 17% \( **5.2**\). In addition, 40% of survey respondents thought that TNH had recently improved its investigative reporting \( **5.4**\). 

 **“TNH provides a much needed accountability mechanism** **for the sector that otherwise prefers to self\-govern”** \(5.4: survey respondent\).** 

 As an example of the impact of this increased investigative reporting: in 2018, a TNH investigation into alleged chronic corruption in the UN’s resettlement process in Sudan led the UN’s refugee agency to suspend resettlement operations in the country \( **5.7**\). 

1.  **Impacts on the Aid Sector at an Institutional Level** 

 A significant proportion of TNH’s readership also claim that its revised approach has stimulated further research and/or advocacy \(73%\), informed organisational and operational priorities \(35%\), and/or prompted a push for policy change \(29%\). 

 **“\[TNH\] scans the globe through a lens that is of unique value for the UN. Your critical voice as an organisation that knows us is of great value”** \(5.8: UN Assistant\-Secretary\-General, Fabrizio Hochschild\).** 

 For example, in March 2017, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and others used TNH as a source when calling on the UN Human Rights Council to launch an inquiry into abuses against the Rohingya \( **5.9**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 People from Asian backgrounds have a significantly higher risk of diabetes compared to Caucasians. Research led by Professor Shahina Pardhan of Anglia Ruskin University showed higher levels of sight\-threatening diabetic retinopathy in Asians linked to poor health literacy, language barriers and lower uptake of retinal screening. The research has led to: \(i\) the development and dissemination of evidence\-led, culturally and linguistically appropriate awareness and lifestyle interventions by policy makers and community organisations; \(ii\) change in patient care practices by healthcare professionals. These have led to behaviour change and improved outcomes in more than 110,417 people in the UK, India, Nepal, China and Thailand, evidenced by an 87–98% uptake of retinopathy screening from a baseline of 20–36%, and a reduced risk of blindness by 60–90%. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Diabetes affects 463 million people globally. Diabetic retinopathy, a serious complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of blindness, especially amongst people of Asian origin. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases significantly when diabetes is poorly controlled and/or when it is not detected early. Timely detection and treatment of diabetic retinopathy reduces the risk of blindness by 60–90%. 

 The underpinning research was led by Prof. Shahina Pardhan and her team listed above at Anglia Ruskin University \(ARU\), with Prof. Jim Gilchrist \(University of Bradford, collaborating on R1\), plus international collaborators at large hospitals in Nepal, India and China, on extensive clinical, lifestyle and health literacy data. The research provided evidence that patients most at risk of sight\-threatening diabetic retinopathy showed lower health awareness around diabetic complications, the importance of good diabetic control and regular retinal screening. The research also showed that patients experienced cultural and language barriers to accessing health information and making lifestyle changes. 

 Pardhan’s research on 500 patients conducted in Bradford and published in 2004 \[R1\] showed a higher incidence of sight\-threatening retinopathy \(STR\) in South Asian compared to Caucasian diabetic patients. South Asian patients had higher levels of STR at a much younger age or a shorter duration of diabetes. Further research \[R2, 3\] found that people of South Asian origin showed lower health literacy around diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, lower awareness around diet and physical activity, and experienced barriers to accessing healthcare, poor self\-help skills and language barriers. 

 Research \[R3\] using focus groups in the UK showed that different South Asian demographic groups \(defined by age, literacy, and gender\) exhibit different barriers to improving the control of diabetes. The illiterate older group reported lack of awareness around the nutritional content of food, language barriers, lack of awareness of the importance of retinal screening, and of the need to rebook missed hospital appointments. Most participants were not aware of any national diabetes education programmes, suggesting that the UK’s current ‘one size fits all’ educational programmes were not culturally appropriate for different ethnicities and hence less effective. 

 In Nepal, Pardhan and collaborators \[R4\] used a questionnaire to gather data on awareness about diabetes control, self\-help and lifestyle in 200 patients. This showed that patients who were at a higher risk of uncontrolled diabetes \(and therefore increased risk of blindness\) also showed reduced health literacy and poor treatment compliance. In addition, although patients self\-reported that their diabetes was adequately controlled, clinical tests showed high blood sugar levels in these patients. 

 Research conducted in India \[R5\] on 190 adults with diabetes showed that, while patients were generally aware of the need for regular exercise, only 55% undertook it regularly. The majority of patients did not know what physical activity to undertake and for how long; also, more men than women with diabetes took part in regular physical activity. 

  

 Pardhan’s research in China \[R6\] on patients with diabetes attending an eye clinic showed that a majority \(67%\) were presenting for the first time with very late stages of retinopathy; as a result, treatment for this group was difficult. A significant proportion of patients showed a lack of awareness that poorly controlled diabetes and poor lifestyles could lead to blindness, and that regular retinal screening was important. In addition, 51% reported that they thought that their diabetes was well controlled when clinical tests found that it was not, and 65% did not undertake the recommended level of exercise.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research impacted two main groups: patients with diabetes, and healthcare professionals in UK, Nepal, China, India, and Thailand. The key findings from Pardhan’s research led to extensive and ongoing engagement with various stakeholders, including clinicians, hospitals, community leaders, and professional bodies within the UK and in Nepal, India, Thailand and China. This in turn led to the development of culturally, geographically and linguistically appropriate strategies to improve health literacy and retinal screening uptake and to promote healthier lifestyles. At least 110,417 individuals with diabetes directly benefited from the research, acquiring a better understanding of diabetes and how to reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy. 

###  Behaviour change through improved awareness of diabetic retinopathy screening in patients 

 **In the UK**, Pardhan and her team, based on the findings of the UK research \[R1–3\] disseminated key information on diet, lifestyle and the importance of retinal screening via interviews on radio and television including ITV News Anglia, British Forces Broadcasting Service, Gurkha Radio \(May 2018\), Salaam Radio \(a Muslim community station\), and Online Services \(OS\) Nepal \[E1 \(i\-iii\)\]. These, in turn, led to invitations by South Asian community groups and clinicians and the co\-production of three short diabetic awareness programmes appropriate for the UK in Nepali, Hindi and Urdu languages, addressing the need for culturally and linguistically appropriate training programmes. The programmes, delivered in the form of video clips in the three languages covering the four themes of good diabetes control, dietary advice on Asian food, physical activity and the importance of retinal screening \[R1–3\] – all directly addressing the lack of knowledge around diet and exercise and language barriers that was identified by the research. The videos were disseminated jointly by the ARU Diabetic Retinopathy Awareness and Prevention Programme \(ARUDRAPP\) led by Pardhan, and community teams at the grassroots level at community centres, mosques, religious festivals and community gatherings across the country, including Aldershot, Peterborough, Hays and Harlington, Birmingham, Bexley and Welling, Cambridge, and Luton \(2018–2020\). Altogether the programme reached 11 South Asian communities across the UK with a joint membership of over 15,150. Following one event, the chairman of the Pakistan Community Association of Peterborough stated that 90% of attendees found the workshop very useful. Participants commented: *“We will share this knowledge and awareness about diabetes and importance of attending retinal screening to our family members and friends who have diabetes”* \[E2 \(i\)\]. Participants attending workshops organised by the Non\-Resident Nepali Association stated: *“We were ignoring letters by doctors…. but we will not ignore them now \- we have now had our eyes photographed and we will continue to do so on a regular basis”* \[E2 \(ii\)\]. This work has the potential for a large nation\-wide study to examine how the behaviour change leads to improved patient outcomes. 

 **In Nepal,** \[informed by R4\] the Diabetes and Endocrinology Association of Nepal \(DEAN\) invited Pardhan and her team to a brainstorming meeting with 25 people in 2018 to develop training for diabetic patients. Participants included representatives of DEAN and the Nepal Health Research Council, diabetic patients, and healthcare providers including a diabetes doctor, a dietician, an ophthalmologist, a physical activity instructor, and a behaviour change worker. Diabetes\-awareness training, culturally appropriate to the Nepali context, was developed in the local language, to address the barriers identified by the research. DEAN stated: “ *This \(research\) has led to improved strategies* *\[and\]*… *an intervention to improve diabetic control”* \[E3\]. The Nepalese Association of Optometrists has been rolling out the training programme via outreach activities to 50 villages in all 7 provinces of Nepal \[E4\]. Since 2018, the Diabetes, Thyroid and Endocrine Care Centre, one of the two major diabetic centres in Pokhara, Nepal’s second largest city, has used the training programme to improve awareness for all their diabetic patients attending clinics \[E5\]. By the end of 2020, the training had benefited 28,356 patients, of whom 89% requested retinal screening compared to 28% prior to the training. A randomised clinical trial \(ISRCTN10990062\) has also been set up in collaboration with Pardhan’s team. Preliminary data shows that 98% of patients in the intervention group requested a diabetic retinal check within three months, compared to 36% in the control group \[E5\]. 

 **In India \(Darjeeling**\), the training programme, developed in Hindi and Nepali, has also been delivered to all patients with diabetes attending Kurseong subdivisional hospital, a tertiary care hospital, since 2018. The uptake of retinal screening was historically as low as 20%. Between January 2018 and May 2020, the training was delivered to 26,556 patients, 88% \(n=23,369\) of whom then requested retinal screening \[E6\]. The programme has demonstrably improved knowledge and awareness of diabetic treatment and uptake of retinal screening. Patients reported: “ *We thought our own herbal medicines are enough \- now we know that we need to take the medicine given by our doctors.” “We will go and have a diabetic eye check today \- we don’t want to go blind by delaying it.’’* \[E6\]. 

###  Changes in patient care by healthcare professionals 

 **In Nepal**, following ARU’s input into an evidence\-based approach \[R3, 4\], doctors at the Himalaya Eye Hospital in Pokhara initiated improved patient care for those needing surgery. The hospital is the largest tertiary eye hospital in the western region of Nepal, providing comprehensive eye care services to a population of 3 million people, with a catchment area covering 25% of the total land area of Nepal. Doctors at the hospital now actively follow up on patients with diabetes. The hospital states that *“Pardhan’s research …. has highlighted the need for more support”* and this has *“led us to target those patients who are more at risk of blindness”.* It points out that this has *“already improved health of a majority \(87%, n=9755\) of our patients who are most at risk of going blind”* \[E7\]. 

 **In India**, the research collaboration between the ARU team and Sankara Nethralaya Hospital in Chennai \(2016–2020 \[R3, 5\]\), led to innovative approaches to improving patient attendance. The hospital, rated among the top four ophthalmic institutions worldwide \(2020, *Newsweek*\) and treating 17,000 patients annually with sight\-threatening retinopathy, states: “ *\[The\] research has directly led to a system by which we now send text messages to all our patients to attend the clinics. We have developed a bespoke one\-to\-one counselling service for patients with sight\-threatening retinopathy to explain the importance of regular attendance and treatment”* and “ *this has already improved attendance…and reduced risk of blindness in 90% \(n=30,600\) of all the patients with sight\-threatening retinopathy”* \[E8\]. 

 **In China**, ARU’s research collaboration \[R6\] with healthcare professionals at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, which is the second largest hospital in Hangzhou \(serving 600,000 outpatients in the country’s eastern region\) led to strategies to address the high level of diabetic blindness in patients attending the eye clinics. Pardhan gave a series of invited talks in October 2016, and also organized a three\-day seminar at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen that brought together 41 researchers from the UK and China, funded by British Council’s Newton fund \(2016\-RLWK7\-10178\), to brainstorm community\-based solutions for vision and hearing problems \(December 2017\). These led to the co\-development of leaflets in Chinese for the hospital. The hospital states *“\[These\] leaflets are the first to be written in Chinese and distributed to every patient attending the diabetic clinic. We have also developed a programme of retinal screening at the point of diagnosis… and we also send regular reminders to our diabetic patients. This has already reduced the risk of diabetic blindness in our patients”* \[E9\]. A further update on data has not been possible because of COVID\-19. 

 **In Thailand**, the ARU research on barriers to retinal screening \[R3, 4\] informed Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok \(2018\) to address the low uptake of retinal screening \(38%\) delivered by Thailand’s national retinal screening programme. Meetings with Pardhan led to the development of various strategies to address this situation, which were approved by the Ministry of Health. The Chief of the Department of Medical Policy Development and Strategic Planning at the hospital states: *“The Ministry \[of Health\] has commissioned a national programme in five regional centres, that is informed by Professor Pardhan’s research to improve compliance of retinal screening and also treatment*”. As a result, eyecare staff from five screening centres in Thailand attended diabetic retinopathy courses in India to upgrade their skills in order to address the barriers that have led to the low levels of retinal screening among patients in Thailand \[E10\]. Further data collection has not been possible due to COVID\-19.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Since the 2003 US\-UK invasion of Iraq, collaborative interventions have been crucial to protect and enhance Iraq’s globally significant cultural heritage for future generations. Roger Matthews is leading a sustained effort to mitigate the catastrophic impacts of war, deliberate destruction, looting, and neglect of antiquities in Iraq, building on decades of collaborative research. Matthews translates archaeological and heritage management research into socio\-political action, dramatically improving and enhancing protection of the cultural heritage of Iraq at local, national, and international levels. Matthews influences international policy on “cultural rights as human rights” with the United Nations; enhances national protections through engagement with the Iraq government and UNESCO; improves documentation and security measures for museum collections; and builds capacity through training Iraqi colleagues. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Archaeological and cultural heritage projects directed by Matthews, in collaboration with colleagues from Iraq, the University of Reading and worldwide, have transformed our understanding of Iraqi cultural heritage and its place in human history. For more than 35 years, Matthews has articulated an increasingly detailed perspective on Middle Eastern prehistory from the Palaeolithic to proto\-history, drawing on his extensive fieldwork and archival research and by applying innovative science, often in extremely challenging circumstances and environments. Matthews has also led research on the challenges facing policy makers in the region, working to preserve regional heritage and employ heritage as a powerful force for good in a society suffering through decades of conflict. 

 **Research on the archaeology of Iraq** 

 In collaboration with Iraqis in the Kurdistan region, Matthews co\-directs with Wendy Matthews the  [Central Zagros Archaeological Project](https://www.czap.org/) \(CZAP\). Funded by the AHRC \(£840k; AH/H034315/2\). The project has shed new light on the prehistory of Iraq. The project’s findings are published in output 1 and 2 and the data archive is accessible through the  [Archaeology Data Service](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/). The importance of the Matthews’ investigations at Bestansur, a previously unidentified Early Neolithic site and the earliest Neolithic settlement in the region, is recognised by the Iraqi Government and international community, with the site inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List, one of only 12 nominated sites in Iraq, and the only prehistoric site. Research now continues with a five\-year project with Matthews as PI, MENTICA: Middle East Neolithic Transition – Integrated Community Approaches 2018\-2023, funded by a European Research Council Advanced Grant \(€2.5m; ERC AdG 787264\). 

 Matthews’ CZAP and MENTICA research unites an international group of more than 50 specialists in archaeology, heritage, and conservation, providing training for over 100 Iraqi, Kurdish, Iranian, and UK students and heritage professionals. It builds on Matthews’ Erasmus\+ grant \(€64k, 2017\-2019\) for staff and PhD student mobility between Reading and four Iraqi and Iranian universities, and a British Academy International Partnership and Mobility awards \(£30k, 2013\), which funded programmes of intensive training for 50 young Iranian and Iraqi academics in the use of archaeological databases. Additionally, with Amy Richardson, Matthews has pioneered the application of pXRF analysis to Mesopotamian clay tablets and sealings to investigate patterns of inter\-city engagement at the dawn of urban history in south Iraq \(output 3\). 

 **Research on cultural rights and advocacy** 

 In 2014\-2017, the deliberate destruction and looting of heritage sites to fund Daesh’s terrorist activities formed a major crisis for Iraq. As President of RASHID International \(Research Assessment and Safeguarding the Heritage of Iraq in Danger\), an international network of human rights lawyers, archaeologists and heritage professionals dedicated to supporting Iraq, Matthews led vigorous efforts to enhance international protections and to safeguard and document archaeological heritage. In this capacity, Matthews led research on cultural rights as human rights, and how engagement with heritage contributes to cultural healing \(output 4\). 
","
 **3. References to the research** 

 The research resulted from competitive, peer\-reviewed grants of more than £3.5m \(AHRC, ERC, British Institute for the Study of Iraq, British Academy, National Geographic, Wainwright Foundation\); it is published with Iraqi colleagues in peer\-reviewed journals and monograph series by reputable publishers. Outputs 1\-4 meet the 2\* quality criteria as they provide and apply important knowledge; contribute to advances in knowledge; apply a thorough and appropriate research design, techniques of investigation and analysis.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Matthews’ research on cultural rights, combined with his academic networks and his broader research on the archaeology of the region, has led to his leadership role within RASHID and the impact described below. The specific research of CZAP/MENTICA has led directly to positive impacts on museums and heritage professionals. 

 **A. Enhancing cultural rights and international protections** 

 Through engagement with the British Council, United Nations and UNESCO, Matthews has directed projects that are enhancing cultural protection. As President of  [RASHID International](https://rashid-international.org/) \(2016\-2020\) and drawing on his research on cultural heritage in Iraq, Matthews has led efforts to embed the concept of “cultural rights as human rights” within international arenas. Following meetings with the UN Special Rapporteur in cultural rights, Matthews has co\-authored four collaborative reports: *The Intentional Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq*, *The Impact of Fundamentalism and Extremism on the Cultural Rights of Women in Iraq*, *Advancing Cultural Rights and the Protection of Cultural Heritage in Iraq*, and *The Implementation of Cultural Rights in Iraq*. These reports have been cited by the UN Special Rapporteur, and directly informed recommendations put forward to the UN Human Rights Council and General Assembly. The UN Special Rapporteur’s report, *Cultural Rights: Tenth Anniversary Repor*t, to the Human Rights Council in 2019 recognised “the considerable advocacy work done by RASHID International” under Matthews’ leadership \(E1\). 



 The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Iraq to the UN Office in Geneva invited Matthews to deliver a keynote speech to the UN General Assembly event on Cultural Rights in Iraq, in March 2018. In 2019 RASHID International received Special Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council – the highest status granted by the UN to civil society organisations. In this capacity, Matthews contributed recommendations on cultural rights to the 2019 Universal Periodic Review of Human Rights in Iraq \(E2\). Matthews also led an initiative lobbying the Iraqi Government to accede to the Second Protocol of the 1954 Hague Convention \(E3\). Following the UN Security Council adoption of UNSC Resolution 2379 \(2017\) on Daesh accountability, Matthews brought together colleagues of RASHID International, Yazda \(a global Yazidi organisation\) and Durham University to publish and submit a report to the UN on the systematic destruction by Daesh of Yazidi heritage sites, *Destroying the Soul of the Yazidis*, providing evidence for persecution of Yazidi cultural heritage as a component of genocide \(E4\). The documented results are informing an exhibition at the Imperial War Museum on cultural heritage destroyed by conflict, supported by the British Council. 

 **B. Safeguarding and documenting cultural heritage** 

 Matthews developed a collaboration between RASHID International and the “Monuments in Mosul” Project at the Czech Academy of Sciences to identify at risk heritage buildings prior to the 2017 liberation of Mosul from Daesh. This work was instrumental in sparing historic and religious buildings from US\-UK air strikes. This action has been highlighted “as a case example of the importance the NGO and academic communities play” in protecting cultural heritage during conflict \(E5\). 

 In order to deter and combat the trafficking of antiquities, Matthews led colleagues in Iraq and from the SmartWater Foundation to apply encoded isotopic signatures to artefacts in Iraqi museums, supported by the DCMS/British Council’s Cultural Protection Fund \(£156k\). This major intervention has trained 43 Iraqi heritage professionals in security measures to protect cultural heritage; enhanced collections records at Slemani Museum and the Iraq Museum in Baghdad; and applied security technology to 273,000 artefacts. The work now provides a best practice case study for conducting cultural protection measures in conflict regions and is cited as “the implementation of a ground\-breaking initiative at a critical time in cultural protection history” \(E6\). 



 New methodologies have arisen from Matthews and Richardson’s research using scientific techniques for sourcing clay artefacts that are being used in repatriation efforts of trafficked artefacts. In September 2019, at the invitation of the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute, Washington, and as a result of high\-profile antiquities trafficking cases in the USA, Matthews and Richardson shared the methodologies with members of the FBI and the US State Department at a collaborative workshop. 

 **C. Enhancing capacity in the cultural heritage sector** 

 1. Matthews’ excavations at Bestansur in partnership with Iraqi colleagues have revealed the earliest evidence for sedentarising communities in Iraqi Kurdistan \(outputs 1 and 2\). Subsequently Matthews advised and supported the Iraqi government to ensure the accession of Bestansur to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List \(E7\). 

 2. At Slemani Museum in Sulaimani funded by $60k from the US State Department, Wendy Matthews, Amy Richardson and Roger Matthews have collaborated with Iraqi colleagues to develop a new prehistory gallery and educational materials incorporating material from their research sites and inspired by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, to encourage museum patrons and especially children to engage with heritage sites across the region \(E8\). 



 3. Investigations taking place at Bestansur, Shimshara and Zarzi as part of the CZAP/MENTICA projects included training more than 100 professionals from the Directorate for Antiquities and Heritage, local excavators, and students from across Iraq and Iran in excavation, recording, analysis, and conservation techniques on\-site. In collaboration with Rozhen Mohammed\-Amin \(Sulaimani Polytechnic University\), Matthews co\-led an initiative to develop a Cultural Heritage Network in Iraqi Kurdistan \(£93k, AHRC GCRF Network\+\), through stakeholder workshops and cultural events. Within the network, Matthews has led workshops with more than 100 heritage professionals from across Iraq and chaired a focus group on “Cultural Heritage Management During Peace and Conflict” with the regional antiquities directors and high\-level policy makers from across the Kurdistan Regional Government \(E9\). 

 This combination of approaches, all arising from Matthews extensive research in the region, have been fundamental in embedding cultural rights and heritage protections at all levels in Iraq. They have enhanced capacity in Iraq’s heritage sector and are empowering communities to protect and develop these globally significant cultural heritage resources for future generations.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Local Governance Research Centre \(LGRC\) directly informed understandings of the work of councillors under austerity, ensuring executive and legislative attention on the critical contribution of councillors to local democracy. First, it has ensured that the changing nature of the tasks, responsibilities and roles with which councillors are faced have been kept on the Government’s policy agenda, while shaping and influencing the work of parliamentary select committees. Second, it has led new thinking on councillors across local government associations and individual councils. Third, working directly with councillors, it has developed systems and mechanisms which strengthen local political leadership and accountability. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research identified and assessed the challenges of local representative democracy and localism in the UK under austerity. It demonstrated how centralised policy narratives and restructurings of the roles, powers and functions of councillors have impacted negatively on local political leadership and democratic accountability \[R1, R3\]. As a body of work, it contested prevailing practices of centralisation, discerning how localism and austerity depoliticise local government by strengthening technocratic/​market service delivery while neglecting local representation and political power and the capacity of councillors to govern localities \[R2, R4\]. Indeed, it advocated an alternative blueprint of local government which was demonstratively ‘local’ and ‘government’ in its workings \[R3, R4\], with Copus, Roberts and Wall \[R4\] articulating a ‘persuasive case in favour of greater autonomy for English local government’ \(P. Eckersley, *Local Government Studies*, 44\(2\), 2018\). 

 At the heart of this contribution was the generation of a novel evidence\-base on the everyday practices of councillors that detailed the roles, powers, tasks, functions, expectations and challenges of the office of councillor \[R3, R5, R6\]. This evidence\-base identified the mismatch between ‘on the job’ experiences of councillors and broader ‘deficit narratives’ of successive governments that characterised councillors as an ‘obstacle’ to local democracy and central policy initiatives \[R1, R3\]. It identified the potential contradictions among councillors between party\-centric ideological views and pragmatic approaches, thereby generating two dimensions of councillor action: first, the corporate or associated councillor which reflected the different relationships of councillors inside or outside the council; and second, the lay or professional councillor, which assessed the nature of the approach councillors take to their office. The research advocated further development of the scrutiny process in local government; and the recasting of centre\-local relations through the development of a localised state \[R3\]. 

 Importantly, the research drew attention to the ‘democratic deficit’ of local political leadership due to the limited engagement of ‘backbench’ councillors in decision\-making, which itself challenged the effectiveness of scrutiny and community leadership reforms. Griggs et al.’s *Two Tribes* 2014 national survey of 2,600 councillors across the UK \[R6\] identified the differential experience of backbench councillors across local authorities, with 46% of backbench councillors no longer believing that they could influence service improvement within their councils. It concluded that centrally led reforms to local government since the early 2000s had sown different identities and divisions among councillors. It posited that ‘two tribes’ of councillors exist, with executive or backbench membership overriding party identification as the primary indicator of policy positions and approaches to the reform of public leadership and management. 

 Finally, *The Voice of the Councillor* \[R5\], a one\-year inquiry \(based on 128 submissions and 31 roundtables engaging over 300 councillors\) concluded that the powers and responsibilities of councillors are increasingly out of step with the nature of their work. Its findings suggested that councillors require and should be able to demand more useable information and data from councils and external bodies. Traditional organisational structures, our evidence suggested, do not always support councillors in the work they do within the council, their communities and with the external organisations with which they now interact.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research raised awareness of the challenges of political leadership and management facing local councillors under austerity. It shaped councillors’ understandings of their roles, while communicating their everyday experiences to national government, political parties and local government membership bodies. Its pathway to impact was based on councillor engagement and co\-production, privileging three ways of working: engaging individual councillors and councils; shaping the strategy of the Association for Public Service Excellence \(APSE\); and putting councillors at the heart of parliamentary debates. 

 **\(1\) CREATING A SPACE OF LEARNING FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNCILLORS** 

 The Councillor Commission opened a space for councillors to voice their reflections on their roles and functions in councils. Copus was the chair of the Commission. He undertook 31 workshops across England, engaging with 24 local authorities and the Local Government Association. He also collaborated with the National Association of Local Councils to undertake a national survey of parish and town councillors. Over 300 councillors participated in the workshops and roundtables; the Commission received 128 submissions from individuals and organisations. The recommendation of the Commission \[R5\] for an inquiry into working relations between parish councils and principal authorities led to the Local Government Association and the National Association of Local Councils producing a guide to effective partnership working \[C1\]. In Hampshire, the work of Copus resulted in the successful bidding for GBP60,000 of additional funding for local councils and the putting in place of a charter between the tiers of councils in the county, as recommended by the Councillor Commission \[R5, C2\]. The *Two Tribes?* report \[R6\] was used as evidence in the 2018 submission to the Boundary Commission of Labour councillors in Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council, with Labour councillors arguing against the increasing workloads resulting from any reduction in the number of councillors ‘for the reasons highlighted in the authoritative APSE report’. The *Two Tribes?* report \[R6\] was also used by the all\-party Kirklees Democracy Commission as evidence of the disengagement of non\-executive councillors from Overview and Scrutiny. Similarly, the report \[R6\] was deployed as campaign advice by the *It’s Our City* resident network in Sheffield for its People’s Petition to hold a referendum on the democratic organisation of the council \[C3\]. 

 **\(2\) SHAPING THE STRATEGY AND PUBLIC POSITIONING OF APSE** 

 APSE is a UK local government membership association, working with over 300 councils. The research \[R1, R3, R6\] shaped its national strategy and public positioning, with Griggs acting as its academic research adviser from 2015 through to the end of 2020. Due to this partnership, APSE undertook a new programme of research and member engagement on the role of councillors \[R6\]. Over a period of three years, APSE funded five policy reports from the LGRC. Internally, APSE’s chief executive states that the profiling and recommendations of the research led to requests for councillor training from its member authorities. Externally, he argues that the research informed strategic interventions with the Conservative and Labour parties, ‘notably our engagements with the Conservative Councillors’ Association and the Labour Party’s Community Wealth Building Unit. It also shaped APSE’s position on Welsh local government reorganisation’ \[C4\]. APSE Scotland have used the research and its findings on Scotland \[R6\] to promote the role of local councillors in the review of Scottish local governance, engaging with Kevin Stewart, Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning, as well as MSPs and local councillors. Its 2017 fringe party meeting at the SNP conference was attended by more than 150 delegates. The research also triggered collaboration between APSE and the Centre for Public Scrutiny. Building on this internal and external positioning, APSE launched its 2030 Local Government Commission in partnership with the LGRC \[C4\]. 

 **\(3\) PUTTING COUNCILLORS AT THE HEART OF PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES** 

 Our research \[R2, R3\] and the organisation and leadership of consultative stakeholder workshops with the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee resulted in the Committee designing a model to empower councillors as governors of their communities, which redesigned working relationships between central and local government. This model was codified by Copus and presented to the Commons in July 2014, as the Local Government \(Independence\) Bill, a private members’ bill proposed by Graham Allen MP, chair of the Committee \[C5\]. 

 As a result of the engagement of Copus with the Communities and Local Government Committee, its then chair, Clive Betts MP, formed an independent commission into the role of councillors \[C6\]. Its findings, *The Voice of the Councillor* \[R5\], were discussed by the Committee at its review of Overview and Scrutiny in Local Government \[C7\]. The Department of Communities and Local Government responded that the findings would ‘inform the work of the department’ \[C8\]. Lord Kennedy, shadow local government spokesperson, referred to the report as ‘an excellent piece of work that must form a key part of the repositioning of local councillors and strengthening their role.’ In October 2017, Lord Kennedy directly posed a written question to Lord Bourne, the then Parliamentary Under\-Secretary for the Department of Communities and Local Government, asking ‘what assessment \[Her Majesty’s Government\] have made of the report The Voice of the Councillor, the final report of the De Montfort University and Municipal Journal Councillor Commission, published in July’ \[C9\]. 

 The findings of LGRC research undertaken for the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on District Councils \(APPGDC\) on the role of councillors was the subject of an adjournment debate in the Commons on 15 November 2017. Responding to the debate, the then Parliamentary Under\-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Jake Berry, commented that ‘the report has shown Government a way in which district councils can remain at the heart of our local government family for the long term’. He added that it was a: ‘hugely important report’ and that ‘the Government will continue to fully engage … and respond over the coming weeks and months to the specific issues raised.’ Mark Pawsey, chair of the APPGDC, ensured that the recommendations of the LGRC research were recorded for the public record in Hansard \[C10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Low\-paid employment is a persistent feature of the UK economy, with important economic and social consequences, including low productivity and in\-work poverty. In 2017, almost 4 million UK workers lived in a household in poverty. Important elements of in\-work poverty are insecure work \(employment sustainability\) and weak labour market progression \(the ability of workers to grow their earnings over time\). This case study details research with national and sub\-regional policy impact, **supporting the roll\-out of new programmes to improve employment sustainability and labour market progression**, including the design and development of a £5.2 million programme **supporting improved training and employment outcomes** for over 2,000 health and care workers in eastern England. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Dr Paul Sissons and Dr Jennifer Ferreira at Coventry University has generated new evidence on labour market outcomes and has developed policy and practice approaches for new sustainable employment strategies. 

 In 2014, Sissons was co\-awarded ESRC funding to investigate ‘Harnessing Growth Sectors for Poverty Reduction’ \(G1\). The project examined transitions into employment, and career progression and job quality for low\-paid workers. The research involved analysis of employment conditions in growth sectors using large secondary\-data sets; and state of the art international evidence reviews on what works in relation to employment entry, in\-work progression and job quality. Research findings from the project were synthesised and examined through a series of policy workshops. The results were used to develop a set of evidenced policy recommendations for harnessing growth sectors for poverty reduction. 

 In G1, Sissons led on two of the evidence reviews \(including in\-work progression \(R1\)\), the analysis of in\-work poverty, as well as contributing to other reports and jointly developing policy recommendations. The outputs included new empirical work, evidence base papers and policy development guidance \(R1\-R2\), and research papers published in internationally leading journals \(R3\-R5\). The research found that many low\-paid workers experience limited pay progression; and that a range of individual characteristics are associated with low pay and reduced chances of progression. The analyses also identified a sector effect on low pay, poverty and escaping low pay; demonstrating a need to focus on employment conditions. The research also highlighted that employment progression had not been a focus of UK government policy. The work provided a series of recommendations for policies and practices to improve employment outcomes. One example being that moves to more integrated health and social care provided a new opportunity to develop novel employment programmes, by promoting entry and progression through a dual customer approach that focused on employer and employee needs simultaneously. 

 In 2014\-2016, Sissons was a co\-investigator on an award from Joseph Rowntree Foundation to work in partnership with Leeds City Region \(LCR\) to develop sustainable employment strategy options for the city \(G2\). The research involved evaluating international evidence and conducting new analysis of national and local labour market intelligence indicators. The core project output \(R6\) included the evidence base, analysis of the opportunities and constraints within the local labour market, and a series of developed policy options for addressing progression needs in the LCR. 

 The research found low pay locally was prevalent in retail, hospitality and residential care; and that supporting individuals to move between sectors can be an important strategy for earnings progression. The analysis also identified that part\-time education and training provision, and careers guidance services, can be supportive of earnings mobility. This informed the development of three interlinked policy initiatives being suggested for the LCR to provide access to employment and training support for low\-paid workers: 

-  A careers information, advice and guidance service providing support for low\-paid workers to access training and progression opportunities. 

-  An in\-work advancement service. 

-  A business support service aimed at enhancing opportunities for part\-time workers.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sissons and Ferreira’s research has generated new evidence on labour market outcomes, employment sustainability and progression, and established novel approaches to addressing these issues. This work has impacted on national and sub\-regional policy and practice in the following ways. 

###  Stage 1: **Shaping policy design** 

 The research has been influential in shaping policy thinking. In 2016, building on discussions of policy needs to support sustainable employment \(G1\), Sissons was invited by the Cities and Local Growth Unit \(a cross\-departmental government unit\) to participate in activities to inform policy design for employment innovation pilots, to be trialled in different parts of the country and to provide learning for new national approaches to employment and skills. Research evidence was used to make the case for a greater emphasis on employment pathways and progression from low pay in the design of new approaches. As a result of these discussions Sissons was invited to provide input to detailed programme design with Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority \(Stage 2\). 

###  Stage 2: Working **with cities to develop local and regional approaches to sustainable employment** 

 In 2017, Sissons was invited to work with stakeholders in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority to utilise research insights to support the development of a new approach to employment entry and in\-work progression \(see ‘Appendix A of S1 ‘Key Stakeholders who support the programme and who have been involved in the programme design’\). R2 presents the argument for a targeted sector approach, and also the potential benefits of integrating provision across health and social care – these ideas are explicitly taken\-up in the core design, as detailed in the business case for funding \(S1\): 

 *“In the report Supporting Progression in Growth Sectors, Sissons et al \(2016\), review the international evidence on in\-work progression in growth sectors this ‘points to a potential benefit of a sector based approach’” \(2016:3\).* 

 *“In the designing of the model we have been able to take aspects that appear to have been successful in other programmes \(as reported in Sissons et al, 2016\), and align these to the local context in order to develop an Innovation Pilot that has the greatest opportunity to be successful in its outcomes and impact. This includes learning from the design of models focused on health and care.”* 

 The business case for funding, which drew extensively on the research, was successful and the Health and Care Sector Work Academy programme received funding from national government as an Employment Innovations Pilot. The £5.2 million programme is an innovative model of activities to support employment entry and in\-work progression in the health and care sectors. The programme provides funding to “train around 2,100 people to secure and progress in a variety of occupations in the health and care sector” \(S5\) and is subject to a robust evaluation to inform the next steps of national policy development \(Stage 3\). The role of the research in the development of the programme is detailed in a supporting letter from the programme lead \(S6\): the research: 

 “*directly informed our thinking around the delivery model adopted in the programme, including a ‘dual\-customer’ approach seeking to meet both employer and individuals’ needs; linking employment entry to longer\-term career opportunities; and the targeting of the health and social care sectors.”* 

 The letter details significant numbers of people who are now finding sustainable employment and highlights the important *‘human stories’* of transformation associated with the programme. 

 G2 developed new research insights on the Leeds City Region labour market and used these to develop a range of potential policy initiatives to support better progression from low\-paid work. Leeds City Region utilised the research \(R6\) to develop new employment and skills strategies. The Report of the Chief Executive of Leeds City Council, *Strong Economy, Compassionate City* \(S3\), discusses ideas developed through the research \(pages 9\-10 \[on interventions drawing from the research\]\). This over\-arching strategy provides the context for the Leeds City Region European Structural and Investment Funds Strategy 2014\-2020 document, which sets\-out the framework for City Region’s £340 million in EU funding \(S4\); including developing new funding streams to support in\-work progression – supporting those in low income and already in\-work \(page 130\) and a commitment to progression across the labour force \(pages 123\-125\). Within this framework the research informed the £2.5 million ESIF allocation for Skills Support for Low Skilled workers, drawing on the model developed in the research which aligns a combination of careers advice and guidance with skills and training delivery to support individuals to progress \(Pages 5\-6\) \(S7\). 

###  Stage **3: Further policy development** 

 As a result of the research projects \(in 2019\) Sissons participated in Department for Work and Pensions evidence workshop on in\-work progression to help inform the next steps around policy design \(drawing on R2, R3, R4, R5\). The Cambridgeshire and Peterborough programme will provide new learning to inform the next phase of policy development. Findings from the research \(R1\-R5\) also continue to provide an evidence base for decision\-making at different levels of government, for example in the National Assembly for Wales \(S2, S8\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Huertas Barros and Vine’s research into translation and interpreting \(T&I\) training has produced findings aimed at improving pedagogy and assessment that have been put into practice in the UK and beyond by a range of translation stakeholders. Impacts include: 

-  direct changes to the assessment practice of commercial translation companies; 

-  enhancing industry understanding of the nature of the trained workforce \(sharing detailed insights into academic provision and practice\); 

-  enhancing translation assessment practice across UK higher education institutions \(HEI\) via the first survey of such provision in this sector; 

-  extending this impact to translator training in Spain.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the spread of competence\-based approaches to translator training, a need has arisen for empirical studies of the extent to which this pedagogical approach is being incorporated in teaching, learning, and assessment on translation courses in HEI. Identifying assessment practice as a valuable lens through which to view current understandings of translation pedagogy, Huertas Barros and Vine undertook a case study of tutors’ \(n=16\) perceptions and use of summative assessment on the MA translation modules at the University of Westminster \[1\]. In doing so they redressed the lack of empirical studies on assessment practices and, more broadly, the lack of research relating assessment practices in translator education to wider HE debates on assessment. The survey results highlighted the need for assessment instruments and marking criteria to more explicitly reflect the skills demands of the commercial translation market \(the majority of tutors surveyed worked in both HEI and industry\); for such assessment criteria to be better clarified; and for assessments to encompass not only the end product but the translation process also. 

 Seeking to test the practical application of their findings, the results of Huertas Barros and Vine’s study were used as a basis for consultation and discussion with the MA teaching staff at Westminster, and this foundational research resulted in the remodelling of assessment practices in the core translation modules via the development of new criteria and a revamped feedback sheet, as well as changes in the weighting of assessments. In light of the changes implemented, Huertas Barros and Vine undertook a study of the broader learning community to assess the efficacy of these changes, surveying both the MA tutors \(n=16\) and the cohort of students \(n=53\) on their perceptions of the marking criteria and assessment patterns \[2\]. Through this second empirical study, Huertas Barros and Vine identified the importance of effectively integrating assessment literacy into course design, finding that fuller understanding of the criteria and processes involved in assessing translation will both raise assessment standards and better equip learners with the ability to objectively assess the quality of translation in their own work and that of others. By demonstrating how the construction of assessment standards can be enhanced through direct engagement with learning communities \(both tutors and students\), the methodology and findings of this research into changes at their own institution constituted an informed proposal for best practice in translation training across the broader sector, which Huertas Barros and Vine would take forward through the activities described in Section 4. 

 Outputs \[1\] and \[2\] were central to the University of Westminster’s successful application for European Masters in Translation \( [EMT](https://ec.europa.eu/info/resources-partners/european-masters-translation-emt_en)\) status in June 2019, with Westminster being one of only 5 institutions to have more than one MA course awarded EMT status. The assessment instruments, tasks, and criteria of the core translation modules of both of the awarded MA courses were redesigned on the basis of the findings of these outputs, demonstrating the value of this research to actionable assessment practice. 

 In carrying out background research for their survey of the assessment practices at Westminster, the researchers found that, although there had been a rapid increase in programmes offering translation and interpreting training, there was no research into how this training was being offered. The next phase of their research project was thus to investigate assessment practices across the UK HEI sector. Huertas Barros and Vine undertook, for the first time, a review of all 27 MA Translation courses offered by UK universities and investigated the extent to which competence\-based approaches and changes in the translation market are actually informing assessment practice on the core translation modules of such courses \[3\]. In regard to competence\-based approaches, the research revealed a diverse range of practices encompassing learning outcomes, assessment instruments and tasks, and assessment criteria. It also revealed unifying trends in the response from UK universities to market changes and new pedagogical approaches to translation. The data collected from the survey was analysed using the concept of ‘fit for purpose’ and the six tenets of assessment set out by the Higher Education Academy \(HEA\) in its paper ‘A Marked Improvement: Transforming Assessment’ \( [2012](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/A_Marked_Improvement.pdf)\), as reaffirmed in ‘The case for transforming assessment in higher education’ \( [2016](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/system/files/downloads/assessment_viewpoint_aug16.pdf)\). Huertas Barros and Vine’s analysis indicates that the use of translation competence as a pedagogical model increases the probability that assessment practices are fit for purpose, and that there is a need to increase awareness of all the HEA tenets of assessment and, particularly, assessment literacy \(outputs \[2\], \[3\], \[4\]\). 

 One of the aims of the above research was to provide an overview of practices and changes in practices that could inform individual universities in their designing of assessment and courses. This has been built upon by Huertas Barros and Vine in their most recent research, which recommends ways to embed the tenets of assessment, especially assessment literacy, into module design and delivery. By introducing a case study on module design with a collaborative transcreation \(the translation of advertising material for use in a different cultural and/or linguistic environment\) project at its core, the researchers were able to identify a set of concepts that can be applied to the curricular needs of translation trainers in order to future proof students in the changing employment market \[4\].

#  4.1 Changes to practice in the translation industry 

 Huertas Barros and Vine adapted the components of best practice identified in their research into adoptable techniques for embedding into an industry context. The researchers then organised and led a joint academia and industry workshop \(June 2017\) for 25 stakeholders which **provided practical methods for enhancing translator competence and quality assessment**, emphasising the importance of the process of translation to the success of the product. 

 Follow up testimony collected two years after the workshop has recorded Huertas Barros and Vine’s direct impact on these industry stakeholders’ practices. These changes – and their related benefits – are outlined in the table below. 

| **Stakeholder**:  [Translator Training](https://www.translator-training.com/about/about-us), an online training provider which has helped more than 1000 students take a professional qualification in translation and employs 45 tutors from industry and education. The following testimony is from the Course Director at Translator Training \[a1\]. |
| --- | --- |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “reviewed our provision of feedback and attendant documentation. After consultation with key staff I decided to make specific changes in line with the ideas discussed at the workshop, to the wording of our feedback sheet, which is provided by translation tutors to students on the distance learning course”; -  the feedback sheet “included further explanation and contextualisation” e.g. Performance Aspects were given definitions, Error Categories were “updated to facilitate a reflective post\-analysis on the part of the student”. |-  “help\[s\] both teachers and students in analysing areas needing more attention”; -  “the diagrammatic/visual layout enables both teachers and students to ‘see’ and chart progress. This can then provide an important starting point for discussion in telephone tutorials or Skype sessions”. |
| **Stakeholder:**  [Hogarth Worldwide](https://www.hogarthww.com/), a leading marketing consultancy firm with over 4,000 employees across 28 cities worldwide that provides language services to clients, including transcreation. The following testimony is from an Account Director at Hogarth Worldwide \[a2\]. |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “created a specific client relevant translation test for new freelance translators. These tests are assessed using our ‘Translator Performance Review Tool’ by our existing specialised and trusted translators”; -  “introduced the Translator Training Pack which is now sent to all new translators”, consisting of client relevant facets: brand background and company profile; glossary in local language; style guide for local language; reference materials; -  “introduced a new approach when it comes to provid\[ing\] feedback to our translators. After each project, we share client feedback with the talents when relevant”; -  “introduced a periodic assessment in case of an internal complaint or in case of an external complaint \(from other talent or client\)”. |-  “before joining our database, all our translators are fully vetted to test their writing skills and subject matter expertise. Only the best are selected”; -  “make\[s\] sure there is consistency across the account and avoid numerous emails to Project managers asking for guidelines on the above subjects”; -  “the translators get familiar with the style and terminology requested by the client \[…\] avoiding future changes or complaints from the client”; -  “keep\[s\] our database always updated with the best talents by stopping any collaboration with those talents that do not meet our quality requirements”. |
| **Stakeholder**:  [Deluxe Media](https://www.bydeluxe.com/en/), a world leading video creation company, encompassing the production of subtitle files for digital cinema releases. The following testimony is from the Team Lead at Deluxe Media \[a3\]. |
| **Changes due to the workshop** | **Benefit of these changes** |
|-  “gave rise to thinking about how to achieve more quality in the quality control team \[…\] at the time, I had little direct experience with translator or translation quality evaluation”; -  “putting in place regular group feedback sessions on client rejections and proactive work quality monitoring”. |-  “the awareness of quality procedures and the use of software has been raised and the number of rejections for obvious errors has decreased” partly because of strategies stimulated by the workshop. |

 The impact of the researchers’ work – through output \[3\] and the surveys described below – has also extended to further language service providers within industry via the Association of Translation Companies \( [ATC](https://atc.org.uk/)\); the language sector’s leading professional body in the UK. The researchers were commissioned to produce an in\-depth industry briefing informed by the data collected in their surveys to **enable language service providers to better understand the nature of the trained workforce**. The ATC’s CEO states: “The briefing was welcomed by the ATC and the language service companies it represents, as it provided up\-to\-date insights into the academic provision undertaken by current and future staff members and freelancers employed or commissioned by the ATC. \[…\] These insights help direct further on\-the\-job training needs, and form a solid basis for understanding new candidates’ academic backgrounds” \[a4\]. The detailed industry briefing authored by Huertas Barros and Vine \[a5\] was published on the ATC website on Dec 1 2020 and was promoted in the ATC Newsletter December 2020 \[a6\], reaching “some 3,500 language services industry recipients” \[a4\]. 

#  4.2 Impact on Translator Training within UK Higher Education 

 The President of the Association of Programmes in Translation and Interpreting Studies in the UK and Ireland \( [APTIS](https://www.aptis-translation-interpreting.org/)\) explains that Huertas Barros and Vine’s 2015 UK\-wide survey on assessment practices on MA T&I programmes, which underpinned output \[3\] above, “was an important undertaking that **made many T&I colleagues across the UK realise the importance of looking at the specifics of translator training provision in the UK**. Their research into T&I provision and the different approaches to translator training in the UK also **acted as a platform through which colleagues have been able to share and inform good practice**” \[b1\]. 

 In this way, Huertas Barros and Vine’s survey stimulated improvements in T&I across the UK, and these impacts were **consolidated by** **the formation of APTIS in response to the survey** having highlighted the need for a peer\-support network of T&I researchers: “This first survey coincided with and contributed to the desire for T&I programmes in the UK to collaborate more closely in order to be in position to face the many challenges facing translator training. To this end, my colleague Dr Castro \(Warwick University\) and I set about creating an association for T&I programmes in the UK in 2016” \[b1\]. This association of 24 HEIs works “to improve the quality of learning and teaching as well as research on translation and interpreting programmes at Higher Education institutions” through knowledge exchange amongst members via newsletters, webinars, a forum, and an annual conference \[b2\]. 

 To this end, the President states APTIS invited Huertas Barros and Vine “to present their cutting\-edge research on translation assessment in a dedicated Workshop at our first annual conference \(APTIS 2018, Aston University\)”, delivered to representatives of 15 HEI institutions \[b1\]. The President adds: “Based on their research, this workshop was extremely successful in **challenging participants’ views on assessment on T&I programmes** and will no doubt have had an impact on the way colleagues think about the assessment strategy on their own translator training programmes” \[b1\]. 

 At the third annual Conference in Nov 2019, APTIS officially endorsed Huertas Barros and Vine’s proposed second iteration of the survey of UK university programmes, this time encompassing 30 institutions \[b3\]. As 5 years had passed since the first survey, the April 2020 follow\-up survey provided richer data reflecting the last 10 years of T&I training and captured changes in HEI and in the related industry \(employers of the trained students\), thus providing an opportunity for educators across the UK to share their best practice and to therefore identify and adopt improvements as found in the practice of others. As the President of APTIS confirms, the researchers’ “initial survey was so **useful to APTIS in gathering and disseminating information about existing T&I courses \(and, therefore, informing best practice\)** that we decided to officially support the second iteration of the survey” \[b1\]. 

#  4.3 Impact on Translator Training in Spain 

 The above impacts created through Huertas Barros and Vine’s surveys and related outputs have also extended into Spain via the “Evaluation in the Acquisition of Translation Competence” \( [EACT](https://pagines.uab.cat/eact/en)\) project, which aims to establish evaluation procedures for different levels of acquisition of translation competence and is led by Procés d'Adquisició de la Competència Traductora i Avaluació \( [PACTE](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en)\); a world\-leading research group in translation training comprising academics from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. 

 According to the EACT Principal Researcher, the project’s first phase “is a replication of Huertas Barros’ and Vine’s \(2016, 2018, 2019\) objective but in the context of translation training in Spain” \[c1\]. As such, Huertas Barros was engaged as an external consultant with “a key role in the design” of the EACT survey of BA Translation programmes in Spain, for which “Huertas Barros and Vine’s surveys \[…\] served as a basis” \[c1\]. 

 Huertas Barros provided advice “in terms of its structure, sections and content as well as the methodological design, including the survey items and response scales, and a first internal validation test of the survey” \[c1\]. Her engagement resulted in the reorganisation of questions, their rewording to avoid ambiguity, the narrowing of their scope, and the replication of 12 questions that had been included in Huertas Barros and Vine’s own surveys \[c1\]. 

 The impact of this EACT survey, finalised in July 2020, replicates that of the one undertaken in the UK **.** The survey provides insight into the current assessment practices in translation training programmes in Spain and **enables identification of the main issues and gaps that need to be addressed to improve translation training and students’ learning experience**, specifically in relation to assessment practices. As such, the survey results “benefit students and tutors given their direct application to translation training material and curriculum design” and also benefits “translators and translation companies by informing guidelines for quality control in translation practice” \[c1\]. 

 The impact of this intervention on the work of PACTE is that the survey outcomes are **vital to their creation of “standardised evaluation procedures” that will validate the accuracy and appropriateness of pioneering competence descriptors** \[c1\]. Previously established in their “Establishing Competence Levels in the Acquisition of Translation Competence” \( [NACT](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en/collaboratinginstitutions)\) project, upon which EACT builds, these competence descriptors provided, for the first time, translation competence levels that function as equivalents to the widely used A\-C Common European Framework of Reference for Languages \(CEFR\), ensuring the quality of translation by enabling consistency between universities and service providers. 

 Huertas Barros and Vine were part of the  [panel](http://grupsderecerca.uab.cat/pacte/en/evaluators) of external expert advisors for the 2015\-2018 NACT project, with the former providing consultancy on the initial proposed framework of competence levels \[c2\]. Both then took part in the appraisal of the revised competence framework by evaluating the appropriateness of each category and proposed level, as well as the text genres associated with each category and their level of progression. The researchers also evaluated and advised on the main abilities and requirements of the different levels \[c3\]. 

 Huertas Barros and Vine thus significantly contributed to both NACT and EACT, the success of which has enabled PACTE to access a €253,280 EU grant for a project that will provide final validation for these descriptors and result in such standardisation in translation training: “ [EFFORT](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/): Towards a European Framework of Reference for Translation”.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Between 2017 and 2020, Leshu Torchin and Philippa Lovatt built on research that combines analysis of aesthetics and contexts to identify documentary’s contribution to political perspectives by collaborating with creative practitioners to enhance cultural understanding of the genre. Their efforts resulted in changes in professional practice in relation to documentary programming and production. Torchin introduced the DocSalon, a public conversation between practitioners, since adopted by the Edinburgh International Film Festival as a recurring annual feature \(2017 to 2019\). Based on the research, Lovatt developed a documentary sound workshop at the Hanoi DocLab \(Vietnam\) resulting in the production of experimental documentaries that have been exhibited locally \(in Scotland\), globally \(e.g. Hong Kong, the US, Switzerland, the Netherlands\), and on the international streaming platform, MUBI.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In their research, Leshu Torchin and Philippa Lovatt have expanded the limits of how documentary can be understood and studied. 

 Since the 1990s, documentary researchers have sought to disrupt the popularly held belief that non\-fiction films are neutral delivery systems for information by highlighting aesthetic tactics that shape perception and by studying the uses of film, particularly propaganda and public affairs. Yet the question of *how* documentaries bring about change and mobilise audiences remained. What was the relationship between seeing, believing, and taking action? 

 To answer this question, Torchin turned her attention beyond the film as end product to study the journey from idea to audience. In *Creating the Witness: Documenting Genocide in Film, Video, and the Internet* **\[R1 \(2012\)\]** she explores the ways documentary contributed to the public understanding of genocide and cultivated urgency and avenues to action by studying not only the film form and content, but also the contexts of production, distribution, and exhibition. The people and institutions involved were determining the aesthetic tactics, guiding interpretation and response. As such, the aesthetics of what looked ‘true’, or urgent were contingent on provenance, technologies, and social, historical, or political conditions. 

 Further, developing the role of different players in documentary meaning\-making, truth\-telling, and response, Torchin, with Dina Iordanova, edited and contributed to the *Film Festival Yearbook 4:* *Film Festivals and Activism*, **\[R2 \(2012\)\]**. The collection combines perspectives of scholars, filmmakers, festival programmers, and activists to identify the myriad ways meaning is constructed and audiences are rallied—not just through the content of the films, but in the circumstances of the viewing encounter. 

 This research did not disregard the work of documentary form and content. Rather, Torchin worked to broaden the parameters of what constitutes documentary, expanding the limits of the genre. In her essay on *Borat* **\[R3 \(2008\)\]**, she argues that Sacha Baron Cohen’s hoaxes in the guise of a fictional character could be read as documentary. Each encounter between Borat and his victim yields insights \(hidden racism, most notably\). Moreover, each encounter encouraged the audience to ask the critical questions they should ask of all documentaries, not just *Borat*: What were the circumstances? Are we seeing everything? 

 Similarly, Torchin’s analysis of *The Missing Picture* **R4 \(2014\)\]**, Rithy Panh’s account of his experiences during the Cambodian Genocide, calls attention to how creativity \- in this case clay figurines and dioramas \- can claim a stronger relationship to truth than the newsreel footage of the Khmer Rouge, the perpetrators seeking to simultaneously justify and obscure their horrors. 

 Building on Torchin’s work, Philippa Lovatt extends the study of documentary into artists’ film, sound, gallery spaces, and Asia. Through the AHRC Networking Grant, ‘Promoting Dialogue Across Critical and Creative Practice’, Lovatt explores how Southeast Asian artists work around and challenge authoritarian governments, using creativity to dodge the censorship risked by more overt documentary style. Her article on Vietnamese experimental eco\-documentaries continues this focus on censorship and witnessing in relationship to artists’ representations of environmental crisis in Vietnam **\[R5 \(2020\)\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2017, Torchin and Lovatt have drawn on their research to enrich the cultural conversation about documentary film and media by collaborating with film programmers and filmmakers, resulting in enhancements to festival programmes and creative practice.  With initial activities and effects concentrated in Scotland and Vietnam, there has been secondary reach in the US, Europe, and Asia. 

 <ins>Programming:</ins> <ins>DocSalon</ins> <ins>at the Edinburgh International Film Festival</ins> 

 In 2017, Torchin collaborated with the Edinburgh International Film Festival \(EIFF\), founded in 1947 with an average 150,000 people \(general public\) in annual attendance. Drawing on her research into documentary **\[R1\-R4\]**, she proposed a public discussion \(a ‘DocSalon’\) on the subject of documentary in the age of fake news, to expose the EIFF audience to the various people who assess, support, and produce documentary, as well as to the ways they understood the value of documentary. 

 Held at the Traverse Theatre \(1 July 2017\), the lively public exchange between a panel of documentary professionals \(festival programmers, commissioning editors, filmmakers\) and audience “ *exceeded our expectations*” according to the Head of Education and Learning, both in size \(73 people in attendance\) with the “ *conversation \[going\] over the 90\-minutes slotted and continued in the Traverse Bar for at least an hour more. The audience was stimulated, engaged, and clearly hungry for more*” **\[S1\]**. 

 
In order to incorporate a format that augments their core mission of “ *transforming lives through the watching, making and understanding of film*”, the EIFF adopted the ‘DocSalon’ as a “ *continued feature for the festival*”, changing their public programme on documentary **\[S1\]**.  Their documentary programmer praised it and Torchin’s work as  “ *invaluable to light shared concerns about what documentary could and should do in educating, entertaining, enlightening; increas\[ing\] appreciation for the work of documentary film, filmmakers, and programmers in an age of fake news and confusion*” **\[S2\].** There have been 3 DocSalons as of 31 December 2020, the second “ *sold out immediately.*” **\[S1\]**. Further programming has been postponed due to Covid\-19 until the festival returns. 

 <ins>DocSalon</ins><ins>’s</ins> <ins>Sustained</ins> <ins>Momentum</ins><ins>: Scotland, US</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and Japan</ins> 

 Double Exposure Film Festival uses Torchin’s The Conversation article to start a public conversation. 

Motivated by reports of an excellent panel, The Documentary International Human Rights Film Festival \(Glasgow\) invited Torchin to chair and speak on a similarly structured Critical Forum on 21st October 2017 at the Centre for Contemporary Arts. **\[S3: Production Coordinator, DOCUMENT\]** 

 In 2019, following his attendance at DocSalon 3, the Director of Media Education, an Edinburgh\-based organisation that provides film training for marginalised communities, invited Torchin to bring the DocSalon there, noting the format’s ability to “ *educate general audiences and professionals on the possibilities and responsibilities of documentary film practice*” **\[S4: Media Education Director\]**. The event has been postponed due to Covid\-19. 

 
Torchin wrote an article on the first DocSalon, which the Double Exposure Investigative Documentary Film Festival \(Washington, D.C.\) used as a conversation\-starter in their social media promotion, describing it as “ *a much\-needed conversation for journalists, filmmakers, and the general public*” **\[S5: Festival Social Media\]**. This piece was translated into Japanese and republished in the magazine, *NewSphere* \(31 July 2017\) **\[S5\]**.

Lovatt’s research illuminating the intersections of artists’ film practice in documentary production **\[R5\]** has resulted in the creation of new documentary art installations, produced in Vietnam, and exhibited in Scotland, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. 

 In conjunction, with her AHRC\-funded Southeast Asian Cinemas Research Network and the Hanoi DocLab \(Vietnam\), a venue dedicated to supporting documentary and experimental film, Lovatt organised a two\-day symposium on experimental nonfiction with a sound\-recording workshop on reality\-based audio hosted by a sound artist. Held in November 2017, the workshop pushed past the documentary expectations of ‘Seeing is Believing’ to delve into the work of aural evidence. It “ *was useful for developing \[their\] own creative practice*”; whilst the symposium \(with 60 in attendance\), “ *helped make this festival the largest event ever since we started to organise it”* **\[S6: Email Programmer, Hanoi DocLab\]**. 

 Creative non\-fiction work followed from the workshop and in the collaborations enabled by the workshop and symposium. 

 
 Everyday's The Seventies \(Nguyen Trinh Thi and Ernst Karel, 2018\) 

*Weekday \(Hanoi\)* \(2017\): A sound installation produced by the workshop participants was exhibited at the Glasgow Short Film Festival \(GSFF\) in March 2018. **\[S7: GSFF Website/Programme\]** 

 *Everyday’s the Seventies* \(2018\): Initially screened at the symposium as a film, it was subsequently developed into a multi\-channel audio\-visual installation piece by the filmmaker in collaboration with the sound artist. This was exhibited at GSFF \(March 2018\) **\[S6, S7\]** and at the Osage Art Foundation, Hong Kong \(March\-May 2018\). **\[S8: Osage Website\]** 

 *The Tree House* \(2019\): This follow\-up collaboration between a symposium participant and the sound artist has been programmed at  the New York Film Festival \(2019\); the International Film Festival Rotterdam, a leading festival of art cinema with 300,000 people \(general public visitors\) each year; and the prestigious Locarno Film Festival, in Switzerland \(2019\). Praised as one of Locarno’s “ *best premieres*” **\[S9: MUBI Festival Notebook\]**, it also received attention for its “ *terrific sound design*” from an international industry journal, *Cineuropa*, which is published in 4 languages with monthly average readership of 450,000 people **\[S10: **Cineuropa** webpages\]**. In August 2020, it was released on streaming platform MUBI with an estimated 100,000 people \(subscribers\) and 8,000,000 people \(registered users\) **\[S11: New York Times\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 There are two impacts from Wootton’s research. First, archaeological sites in Libya and Tunisia are better safeguarded and conserved because of changes to the management practices of local heritage professionals in response to research\-led training from Wootton. Second, through initiatives informed by his research, Wootton has boosted the resources and prospects of the craft community of UK mosaicists, by founding the London School of Mosaic, and engaged public interest in ancient making. Both impacts derive from papers published between 2011 and 2020, which propose a new integrated approach to the study, care and appreciation of ancient artefacts and archaeological sites. This longstanding cross\-disciplinary research draws on Wootton’s practical experience and brings together the skills of archaeologists, conservators, craftspeople and heritage professionals. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Wootton’s cross\-disciplinary research into crafts, mosaics and sculpture in particular, has been fundamental to both impacts. Better understanding of the practicalities of ancient production, from art to architecture, has provided, and continues to provide, new insights which have enabled the development of professional training and community\-based strategies for safeguarding archaeological sites, the enhancement of skills and the establishment of resources to support modern professional artists, and novel ways of engaging public interest. 

 Wootton’s 2012 peer\-reviewed article on the newly discovered Hellenistic mosaic from Tel Dor, Israel \[1\] exemplifies how his practitioner’s perspective generates a more sophisticated understanding of art production processes, from practicalities to economics, and of the social context, especially relationships between craftspeople and commissioners. His research collaboration with the contemporary sculptor, Peter Rockwell, similarly delivered new insights into the archaeological evidence for ancient sculptural techniques. This research project, funded by the Leverhulme Trust \(2011–13; GBP209,834\), with Wootton as Principal Investigator, Bradley \(Digital Humanities\) as Co\-Investigator and Russell as postdoctoral researcher, was delivered as a website \[2\], including peer\-reviewed essays, images and videos, which enabled analytical presentation of the tools, materials and techniques of Roman sculptors in a way not possible in traditional publication formats. It thus provides a novel research\-based template for more informed recording of ancient sculpture and large\-scale monuments, with a view to their study and conservation. Since 2017, the website has hosted films on mosaic techniques, extending the research insights on ancient making. 

 In his 2017 peer\-reviewed chapter with Russell \[3\], Wootton draws on his research to demonstrate the value of the maker’s approach across a variety of different media. This approach has generated a more dynamic understanding of making, new documentation strategies and novel insights into conservation and safeguarding through practice and experiment in the field. Since his 2014 publication \[4\], Wootton has advocated and fostered collaborations across disciplines and between stakeholders which had previously not communicated well. His 2015 peer\-reviewed article \[5\] presents the development of two methodologies, one related to capacity\-building and the other to conservation. These result from his project, funded by the Getty Foundation, Conserving and Managing Mosaics in Libya \(CaMMiL; 2011–13; GBP64,000\), carried out with Walda, an archaeologist and contributor to the 2014 Impact Case Study, and two architect\-conservators, El\-Habashi and Stewart, in co\-operation with the Libyan Department of Antiquities \(DoA\). Expanded research through practice in Libya and also Tunisia was reported in Wootton’s 2020 collaborative paper \[6\], co\-authored with Alkhalaf, a postdoctoral researcher at King’s. With members of the DoA and the Tunisian Institut National du Patrimoine \(INP; National Heritage Institute\), it reports on the outcomes from ‘Training in Action: From Documentation to Protection of Cultural Heritage in Libya and Tunisia’, a project with Leone \(Principal Investigator, Durham\) and Fenwick \(UCL\), funded by the British Council \(2017–19; GBP956,135\). These two papers detail how training systems were devised, combining theoretical and practical teaching, appropriate to the different heritage roles of the Libyan and Tunisian participants, aimed at creating shared knowledge and sustainability. They explain the creation of a standardised approach to the management of objects, monuments and sites, integrating recording, assessment, planning and intervention. They stress the value of building relationships with community groups and demonstrate how this was done during the training and the subsequent conservation activities. Co\-authorship of the 2020 paper with Libyan and Tunisian colleagues encapsulates the research perspective which Wootton has developed, of producing knowledge collaboratively between archaeologists, conservators and heritage professionals.

 There are two impacts from Wootton’s research: 1\) improving heritage management in Libya and Tunisia; and 2\) stimulating modern mosaic\-making in the UK. 

#  1. Improving heritage management in Libya and Tunisia 

 Impact from Wootton’s research consists of building capacity among heritage professionals in Libya and Tunisia for effective intervention to preserve archaeological sites. The focus on documentation, assessment and community engagement was identified during research carried out by CaMMiL and put into practice via the project ‘Training in Action’ \(TinA\). The safeguarding outcomes deriving from the enhanced capacity are as follows: 

-  Eleven archaeological sites received new assessments of condition and risk, and plans have been implemented for their future protection \[A\]. This includes World Heritage Sites, such as Sabratha, where TinA’s contribution to conservation and management was highlighted in the DoA’s 2019 submission to UNESCO \[B\], and sites of great significance to local populations but less well known internationally \[Figure 1\]. 

-  New Statement of Significance for the coastal site of Iunca has been co\-produced with local stakeholders as a result of engagement activities, including a Tunisian Heritage Day \[Figure 1\] to encourage local ‘ownership’ of the site \[A\]. 

-  A major awareness\-raising campaign was mounted along the coast of eastern Libya \(Cyrenaica\), including at the site of Cyrene, as well as at two other World Heritage Sites, one in western Libya \(Lepcis Magna\) and another in Tunisia \(El Djem\) \[A\]. 

-  Outreach sessions have been organised in 23 schools in southern Libya \(Fezzan\) \[Figure 1\], attended by around 150 children and 100 adults. Educational packs were co\-created, explaining the local heritage and giving guidelines on custodianship \[A\]. 

-  New signage in local languages has promoted community engagement with the sites of Iunca, Lepcis Magna and the Acacus \[Figure 1\], where the campaign ‘Antiquities: know them, preserve them, live with them’ included an exhibition, the distribution of leaflets explaining how to protect rock art and the first ever bilingual site panels in Arabic and Targia \(the indigenous Berber language\) \[A\]. 

 The principal pathway from Wootton’s research to these outcomes was enabled by the TinA project, in which Leone and Fenwick covered survey, geographic information system \(GIS\) and rapid documentation techniques, while Wootton was responsible for site conservation and management. Wootton’s contribution was informed by his research into art making and archaeological conservation, as well as the research through practice in his and Walda’s previous trial project to improve management of ancient mosaics at Libyan coastal sites \(included as output in REF 2014\). Six TinA workshops were held in Tunisia between 2017 and 2019, attended by over 50 members of Libya’s DoA and Tunisia’s INP who work directly in site protection and conservation \[C\]. The participants then ran ‘mini projects’, mentored by TinA trainers \[cf. 6\], at their own heritage sites which produced the safeguarding achievements listed above, and also transmitted skills to over 50 colleagues. This training was itself an impact as well as pathway, as is demonstrated by feedback from the participants \[A, C.1\]: “\[TinA has\] played a big role in changing our style and our way of dealing with heritage and its management”; “I used to consider that the local community near archaeological sites posed a threat to them, but after the TinA project, I now view the community as an active partner in the protection of cultural heritage and not a threat.” The impact on local communities is demonstrated by the overall reach of the project’s Facebook page at over 400,000 people, with individual posts during King’s events reaching nearly 50,000 and the films being viewed over 2,000 times \[C.2,C.3\]. Feedback from the Iunca Heritage Day exemplifies local impacts: 89% of children said they now understood the site better and 60% of adults said they felt more committed to it \[A\]. The Directors of the DoA and INP have acknowledged TinA’s impact on national practice in the co\-authored report on the project \[6,A\]. Recognising the better management of the sites, the empowerment of local professionals and the sustainability benefits of involving the local population, the Libyan DoA has signed a new partner agreement with Wootton \(only\) for a three\-year project \(‘Managing Libya’s Cultural Heritage’\) from March 2020, funded by the ALIPH Foundation \(USD773,075\). The new project will focus on the removal of three World Heritage Sites from UNESCO’s ‘In Danger’ List using the King’s research methodology \[D\]. 

#  2. Stimulating modern mosaic\-making in the UK 

 Professional mosaicists are a niche group within the UK craft community, estimated at around 200 by the Craft Council in 2012 \( *Craft in an Age of Change*\), with limited public profile and professional support. Wootton has used his research into ancient making as a springboard to enhance the public profile and the professionalism of the mosaicist community, culminating in 2017 when the London School of Mosaic opened \[E.1,E.2; Figure 2\]. Inspired by Wootton’s research, the school was planned collaboratively with David Tootill \(then Director of Southbank Mosaics\) to reinvigorate the mosaic craft in the UK, based on historical understanding, conservation best practice and community engagement. The year\-long diploma, the only one of its kind in the UK, which is accredited by the Scottish Qualifications Authority, is now in its second year, with 15 enrolments \(equivalent to 7.5% of practising UK mosaicists\). Wootton is Chair of the Governing Body and has led on academic matters. He gives research\-led lectures and conducts applied projects reproducing ancient techniques resulting in the public display of re\-made Roman mosaics, such as at Bignor Villa in 2019 \[E.1\]. Francesca Busca, diploma graduate and artist, affirms the success of the research\-led approach: “\[Wootton’s\]own work as a researcher \(such as his publications on the Hellenistic mosaic of Tel Dor …\) and the engagement in the practical activity of making a mosaic using ancient materials and techniques … are a most effective way to deliver a first\-hand approach to ancient mosaic … \[and\] has influenced my own practice … realis\[ing\] how similar and valid the reasoning behind the earliest mosaics still is … which I continue to adopt and master a little more…” \[E.2\]. 



 Figure 2: London School of Mosaic; Masterclass 2017: before/after in general making ability \[F\]; film on traditional cutting techniques; Masterclass 2019: before/after in overall technical ability \[F\] 

 In parallel, Wootton has run masterclasses in 2017 and 2019 attended by 22 professional mosaicists who created contemporary mosaics using Wootton’s exposition of ancient techniques \[F; Figure 2\]. Feedback emphasised that almost all participants improved their knowledge and skills, gained confidence in their practice, and felt that this would improve their business \[F\]. Feedback commented on: “The workshop helped provide more historical context. \[I have\] a much better knowledge and appreciation of traditional techniques, and reassurance I’m doing some things right”; “It has definitely given me more confidence in moving forward with my own large scale project”; “I feel richer in terms of knowledge, experience, and meeting people … It has ‘cemented’ my feeling that I am part of a historical tradition …”; “It has reawakened an interest in Roman methods and I have more respect and admiration for their work”; and “\[I have\] new skill using classical method of andamento and being able to incorporate this into my work. I have a better understanding of the ‘logic’ behind Roman mosaic\-making in terms of their designs and the approach of the economy in making.” Masterclass and diploma graduates have seen the benefits of their enhanced skills, with the latter working on a major commission for a private project to recreate a series of Romano\-British mosaics in 2020 \[E.2\]. 

 Building to these two impacts, Wootton has showcased current research into ancient craft production, principally mosaics, sculpture and textiles, to increase public understanding and appreciation of ancient and modern making \[G\]. Feedback at a 2013 workshop was enthusiastic: “\[I have learnt\] So much\! … \[It has\] added to my appreciation of craft skill, sensory experience, collaboration and community.” The impact of Wootton’s research disseminated online reaches even further \[H\]. The Art of Making website has attracted a global audience since 2013 of over 78,000 visitors. Feedback has highlighted its value for teaching in schools: “Excellent resource for teachers and students especially those doing Cambridge Latin Course 3 and OCR AS/A Level Classical Civilisation”. The short films, including those from the mosaic workshops, have been viewed over 180,000 times; on average 60% of each video was viewed, attesting to very high engagement levels. The digital book on stone\-working has been downloaded over 42,000 times. Thus Wootton’s research into ancient making has generated in the UK a specific professional impact and a general public benefit which are mutually sustaining and productive.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 St Andrews Classics research on military culture and practice has changed perceptions of ancient Roman military society and influenced present\-day military culture. Our research has expanded modern understanding of ancient military culture and its ever\-pressing relevance for the modern world. The research has led to better understanding of the influence of historical events on individual and group attitudes and behaviours in modern conflict zones, and has helped to improve relationship\-building \[text removed for publication\]. In addition, our research has shaped the cultural sector by influencing curatorial practice in 7 museums \(21 exhibits between 2014 and 2019, including the Victoria & Albert, London in 2017\), by influencing theatrical practice in 1 theatre company, and by influencing 4 military reconstruction groups as well as 7 high\-circulation magazines. Moreover, through sustained engagement with museums \(e.g. Victoria & Albert, London; Arles, France; Koblenz, Germany\) and regular and specialist press \(e.g. *National Geographic*\), this research has directly engaged approximately 10,500,000 and reached approximately 44,540,000 people \(general public\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 St Andrews research into ancient military identity, visual imagery and writing underpins this impact case study. This work centres around research on ancient constructions of military identity by both soldiers and civilians \(R1\-R3\), and on military discourse and the evolution of military ideas in a range of ancient cultures \(R4\-R6\). 

 Research by Coulston on ancient constructions of military identity is in three related areas of Roman archaeology: \(i\) Trajan’s Column in Rome \(R1\), \(ii\) soldiers and military equipment in figural art \(R2\), and \(iii\) the imagery created for and by Roman soldiers, especially cavalrymen, in the culturally diverse frontier region of Hadrian’s Wall, UK \(R3\). Trajan’s Column has been central to the study of ancient warfare, imperialism, and triumphal display since the Renaissance, influencing 19<sup>th</sup> century painters and 21<sup>st</sup> century filmmakers alike. Coulston’s current research \(including analysis of the sculptural frieze directly accessed via scaffolding covering the monument, on visits conducted between 2014 and 2017\) builds on a much larger body of work going back four decades. He has also conducted extensive comparative study of military artefacts and iconography from other archaeological contexts, across the territory of the former Roman empire. His research demonstrates how the Column provides a view of military achievement and of the roles of soldiers in Roman society as seen from the imperial capital \(R1\). 

 He has published research on arms and armour, archaeological *corpora* and comprehensive regional and subject studies: for example, analysis of figural gravestones and other monuments depicting Roman cavalrymen \(R3\), sculpture found along Hadrian’s Wall, and the standard work on Roman military equipment \(R2; Spanish edition 2016\). His research has transformed understanding of how soldiers were represented and perceived in Roman society, including issues of their training, identity, status, welfare, trauma experience, societal dysfunction, and family dependents. The range of his projects illuminate continuities and changes over time and place, allowing for more nuanced appreciation of Roman military society as a comparative window into modern military cultures. 

 St Andrews research on the evolution of Greek and Roman military ideas and their influence on other cultures and communities, ancient and modern, focuses on three interlocking areas, \(i\) ancient technical writing \(R4\-R6\), \(ii\) interplay between battle narratives and discourses of war in ancient and modern cultures \(R5\), and \(iii\) interactions between Greek, Roman and ‘barbarian’ military thinkers and soldiers in the Roman empire \(R6\). König’s publications have shed new light on classical military theory and on ancient methods of learning and teaching strategic leadership and decision\-making. In showing, for example, that some ancient military handbooks function like battle\-simulation exercises \(R4\), König has enhanced understanding of the dynamic relationship between ancient military theory and practice, and illuminated the role played by exemplary anecdotes in shaping military mindsets and proficiency. Her study of Medieval and Renaissance uses of ancient military handbooks has underlined the powerful resonance of historical narratives in visualisations of future war, leading to new research on the complex feedback loop between narrative and reality in the planning, conduct and prevention of armed conflict \(R5\). In 2017, König co\-founded an interdisciplinary research network \(‘Visualising War’\) to explore the ways in which ancient battle narratives migrate across different genres and media, in different periods and places, canonising particular ideals about military culture and practice, and shaping different communities’ discourses of war. From this project, several of König’s contributions have emerged: 

-  her field\-changing research into literary and cross\-cultural interactions in the Roman empire \(R6\), which has pioneered new methodologies for studying the transmission of values and ideas between different cultures; 

-  more recent publications have explored how the accumulation of battle narratives from many different periods and places in Frontinus’ *Strategemata* might have complicated Roman definitions of and attitudes to ‘civil’ war \(R5\); 

-  how military experts from different cultural communities in the Roman empire exchanged military know\-how and represented their respective military identities \(R6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Coulston and König’s research has enhanced the experience of defence professionals, museum professionals, broadcasters, theatre professionals, re\-enactors and school teachers, delivering significant social, cultural and educational benefits: \(a\) by equipping over 100 people \(serving soldiers\) with historical knowledge and cultural understanding that enhances their operational effectiveness, and \(b\) by shaping the cultural sectors through influencing curatorial and theatre practices, military reconstructions, and high\-circulation magazine articles. 

 **Enhancing Military Training: Professional Development for Cultural Advisors in the Army, Navy and RAF** 

 König has helped improve the cultural awareness and decision\-making abilities of cultural advisors in the Army, Navy and RAF. \[text removed for publication\] Her teaching drew directly on her research into ancient military training manuals \(R4, R5, R6\), the feedback loop between battle narratives and behaviours in military contexts \(R4, R5\), and cross\-cultural interactions in the Roman empire \(R6\). The soldiers she trains need to be able to \[text removed for publication\]. The overarching goal of these courses was to improve the operational effectiveness of British armed forces at home and abroad. Evaluation of course feedback by \[text removed for publication\] reveals that König’s use of ancient military history and texts has positively influenced trainees’ role\-preparedness and decision\-making in the field. \[text removed for publication\] 

 **Shaping the cultural sectors through influencing curatorial and theatre practices ** 

 Since 2014, our research has transformed curatorial and theatre practices regarding the Roman army and war narratives, primarily through promoting a series of events in the cultural sector. Testimony collected at these events demonstrates the benefits delivered to a variety of constituencies, specifically museum and gallery professionals, the museum visiting public, theatre professionals, and the theatre\-going public. 

 Coulston has been instrumental in restructuring several museums and exhibitions, which has in turn influenced museumgoers’ understanding of the place of the Roman army in its contemporary society. In 2014\-15, Coulston worked with McManus Galleries in Dundee to produce the Roman armour display for the  [*Power & People*](https://www.dca.org.uk/assets/general/McManus_Roman_Empire_Exhibition.pdf) exhibition. He advised on captions and images for the exhibition and gave gallery talks and a public lecture, ‘Roman armour’ \(see R1\). This exhibition attracted 50,583 people \(visitors\), 15% higher than its average attendance numbers \(S2\). In addition, the exhibition led to a change in museumgoers’ habits, with 22% saying they would be more likely to attend other cultural events after this, as well as opening up collaborations for the McManus with the British Museum and other collections \(S2\)., as well as opening up collaborations for the McManus with the British Museum and other collections \(S2\). Similarly, through Coulston’s work with English Heritage, refurbishing the museums along Hadrian’s Wall at Corbridge \(the largest site\-based collection of Roman sculpture in Britain\), Housesteads \(Northumberland; the most visited Roman site in northern Britain\), and Birdoswald \(Cumbria\). Coulston wrote the consultation document and the full captioning for all sculptural and epigraphic exhibits at Corbridge and Housesteads, many of which vividly present Roman soldiers to the modern viewing public \(S3\). This work was instrumental in increasing footfall at Corbridge from 16,000 to 25,000 people \(visitors\) \(S3\). Museum visitors came away from the exhibitions with a new appreciation for the place of the Roman army and soldiers’ own self\-understanding. The value of this consultation is summed up by the Senior Curator at English Heritage: “ *Dr Coulston has contributed to five projects over the past decade. His advice and academic analysis has helped steer research strategies, improve object catalogues and enabled English Heritage curators to deliver more nuanced and informed exhibition content, drawing on the most current academic thinking*” and “ *The input of Dr Coulston over the past 10 years…is crucial if we are to present the most up to date analysis, and interrogate our collections to bring out new and engaging narratives for our visitors*.” \(S3\) Between November and December 2017, Coulston advised on the Casts Court project at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, dedicated to the restoration and cleaning of the only ‘assembled’ cast of Trajan’s Column. This helped disseminate knowledge of the monument’s creation, recording, preservation and modern reception among museum visitors \(footfall of approximately 4,400,000 people \(general public\) in 2017\-18\), but also had a direct effect on the museum staff. According to the Senior Sculpture Conservator at the V&A, Coulston’s St Andrews  [website](https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/trajans-column/) on Trajan’s column \(based on R1\) was a key resource for V&A staff: “ *we referred to this often and followed up references suggested on the website*”, and “ *V&A colleagues agree with me it has be \[sic\] a valuable aid to our understanding and interpretation of the form and narrative of our Museum object*.” \(S4\). Coulston also wrote the keynote paper for the exhibition catalogue for an exhibition on the Roman army at the Musée départemental Arles antique, “ *France’s top\-ranking provincial museum in terms of Roman Archaeology, with \[approximately\] 160,000\-200,000 \[people\] visitors annually*”. The resident archaeologist confirmed the exhibition “ *was of tremendous success, since 41,390 people came to see it between the 15th of December 2018 and the 22nd of April 2019, despite the tense local situation due to the ‘Yellow Vest’ demonstrations in full swing at that time …\[it\] is to a great degree due to Dr Coulston’s involvement, and its impact will be long\-lasting through his important contribution to the exhibition catalogue*” \(S5\). 

 König has also helped change thinking about war narratives in the cultural sector, through her consultancy work in 2019 and 2020 with  [NMT Automatics](https://nmtautomatics.com/) theatre company, which updates classical texts to give them relevance for a modern audience, fusing dance and drama and taking music as a primary source of inspiration. König’s work has helped to inform the creative practice of this up\-and\-coming theatre group: “ *König’s research… has had an enormous impact into the way we have approached creating a show*”; “ *Her research has given us an impetus to explore the way we, as performers, can break cyclical habits of visualisation, and impact a general public in a way which edifies their acuity in regards to war*.” \(S6\). Through the mouthpiece of NMTA, König’s research on perceptions of warfare, ancient and modern, has also won a wider audience via the webinar of Love, War, Myth and Reality’ of the  [Army at the Fringe event](https://www.armyatthefringe.org/virtual/two/love-war-myth-and-reality/), launched 19 August 2020. 

 **Increasing public awareness of the Roman Army through influencing historical re\-enactment and high\-circulation magazines** 

 In addition to museum and theatre collaboration, St Andrews research \(as described in Section 2\) has also increased awareness of the Roman army through public re\-enactment events. Coulston organized the Nineteenth International Roman Military Equipment Conference \(RoMEC XVIIII\) at St Andrews in 2016, taking the theme ‘Cavalry in the Roman World’, and incorporated both a dedicated session for planning the *Hadrian’s Cavalry* exhibitions, and mounting a tactical display by two reconstructed Roman cavalrymen. The conference series is inclusive, appealing to a broad, interested public, with the approximately 100 people \(attendees\) having varied interests and backgrounds. According to the Head of Programmes and Collections at Tyne & Wear Museums: “ *This event provided an unheard of opportunity to bring academics, museums professionals, heritage resource managers and members of the general public together in an open forum to plan and discuss exhibition organisation, themes and content.*” \(S7\) Sustained involvement with cavalry projects thereafter led to Coulston’s collaboration in *Hadrian’s Cavalry* \(between April and September 2017\), a multi\-location exhibition held in 10 museums along Hadrian’s Wall \(UNESCO World Heritage Site\). This led to a “ *12% increase in visitors to the Wall and garnered international coverage*” \(S7\). Coulston advised on the acquisition of loan\-objects, gallery design and reconstruction of cavalry equipment. This climaxed with the *Turma\!* event in Carlisle \(1\-2.7.17\), featuring 30 people \(Roman riders\) in a unique re\-enactment of exercises described by the Roman writer Arrian \(S7\). Audience feedback for this event was extremely positive: for example, “ *The Turma was awesome*”; “ *Turma was a real experience of Roman history*” \(S7\). 

 Similarly, Coulston gave 9 talks and seminars for re\-enactment groups in New Zealand \(July\-August 2019: Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin\), holding workshops with members of the public in order to advise on equipment and improve reconstructions. In the words of an Associate Professor at the University of Auckland: “ *This instilled a renewed ethos of faithful reconstruction within these groups, brought them up to date with the latest archaeological finds and developments, and directly impacted their construction and display practices for the future*.” \(S8\) 

 Finally, St Andrews research has engaged wide public audiences through influencing high\-circulation publications in 7 popular magazines. Among these, Coulston contributed to graphic reconstructions and text for a major article on ‘Trajan’s Amazing Column’ in *National Geographic* \(227.4, 2015, 116\-29; online version is available here:  [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan\-column/article.html](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan-column/article.html)\), for which the gatefold won gold in the prestigious Malofiej graphic design prize for 2016 which is “ *akin to winning an Oscar in the infographics field*” according to the Senior Artist at National Geographic \(S9\). In 2016, National Geographic had a  [worldwide circulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic) of approximately 6,100,000 people per month, with a worldwide readership of approximately 30,000,000 in 41 languages \(S9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ensuring the supply of blood to health services is critical to saving lives. Cranfield’s innovative blood supply chain inventory management and logistics modelling research has had significant impact at both national and international levels.  Notably, within the UK, Cranfield has enabled National Health Service Blood and Transplant \(NHSBT\) to appreciably improve efficiency and decrease wastage. Exemplified by a 33% reduction in national bloodstocks held at any one time \(2016 cf. 2013\), less wastage of a perishable and critical resource which cannot be manufactured synthetically, whilst ensuring stocks are available to meet the average annual NHS need of 1.4 million units of blood \(2019\).

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 To maintain the health and wellbeing of the population, blood products are required for a large range of patient treatments throughout the NHS. The consequences of a unit not being available in the right place at the right time can, in the worst case, lead to the death of a patient. Blood components will always be a limited and precious, perishable resource as they cannot be manufactured artificially. Ensuring sufficient supply of blood products in the right place at the right time, whilst minimising wastage of a precious resource, in the context that shortage may have lethal consequences, is one of NHSBT’s most demanding challenges. 

 Since the mid\-2000s, drawing on Cranfield Supply Chain Research Centre’s strong background of research in supply chain management; we have applied supply chain management theory to improve the efficiency of blood supply chains.  This research has had impact both within the UK and Australia.

 As part of a two\-year funded Innovate UK, Knowledge Transfer Partnership, Cranfield developed a novel model for predicting national demand for red blood cells, by establishing the critical factors that influenced the use of blood in the supply of blood products to hospitals. Thus, applying the theoretical principles of statistical forecasting to a novel context \[R1&R2\]. \(2008 to 2010\). 

###  Perishable Inventory Management 

 Theoretical perishable inventory management literature suggests that sophisticated and complex inventory models will drive performance. However, Cranfield’s qualitative research with hospital inventory managers found that, in practice, a combination of basic well\-grounded inventory theory with simple management procedures, carried out by experienced staff, leads to better performance \(2008 to 2010\) \[R3&R4\]. 

###  Bloodstock Levels and Wastage 

 By 2013, overall demand for red blood cells in the UK had decreased by 5%, but the stock levels in blood centres and hospitals remained the same. Grounded in the theory of supply chain segmentation, this research analysed the relationship between red blood cell demand, stock levels and time expiry wastage using descriptive statistics and linear regression to determine data patterns and produce a predictive model to determine ideal stock levels for red blood cells across NHSBT \[R4&R5\]. \(2013\) 

###  Logistics Service Provision 

 In 2016 NHSBTs hospital logistics operation was experiencing an increasing problem of reducing revenue and increasing cost to provide the service, reducing money available to provide services to patients.  To help find solutions to this problem, Cranfield employed the Discrete Event Simulation methodology to model four blood centres and their associated hospitals.  Extensive scenario analysis investigated novel charging mechanisms and delivery strategies in a risk\-free environment, leading to the development of a new charging mechanism framework and hospital delivery strategies. \(2016\) 

###  Platelet Distribution Model 

 Platelets, with their exceptionally short shelf life \(7 days in 2017\), need particularly careful and active management to maximise their usefulness and minimise wastage.  Cranfield developed an innovative analytical model to allow for planning distribution and allocation of this precious resource, incorporating perishability, substitution, and transport costs.  The model incorporated a novel substitution logic, including a range of clinical factors not considered previously \[R6\]. \(2018\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>Cranfield’s world\-renowned supply chain expertise has enabled the NHSBT service, staff, hospitals, and millions of patients to benefit from the implementation of service improvements. The collaborative relationship between Cranfield and NHSBT commenced in 2005. Impact since 2013 can been seen in enhanced demand planning, stock management, logistics provision and reduction in blood wastage, as detailed below. The findings from Cranfield inventory management research were a</ins><ins>lso</ins> <ins>adopted by the National Blood Authority in Australia, as below.</ins> 

 **Red Cell Demand Planning** 

 <ins>The novel red cell demand planning model, devised and implemented by Cranfield, was embedded in NHSBT, achieving significant forecasting accuracy improvements compared to previous methods. The model changed demand planning practices within NHSBT, enabling more accurate prediction and better management of national blood stocks across the service.</ins> 

 “Our collaboration with Cranfield meant that fresher blood was being delivered to our hospitals with longer expiry times, therefore reducing costs and ultimately increasing customer satisfaction” <ins>\[S1\].</ins> 

 <ins>The model, which was used for several years, became the catalyst for a web\-based demand planning system with enhanced visibility of ‘actual’ demand data \(rather than just what was issued\) and a Department of Health planning tool. This impact began in 2010 and these practices continue to reap benefits to the present day \[S1&S2\].</ins> 

 Perishable Inventory Management 

 <ins>The research carried out with hospital inventory managers identified six key drivers of good inventory management performance to inform good inventory management practice and performance. In addition to demonstrably improving practice in the NHS \[S2\], these were taken up by the National Blood Authority, Australia who adopted the six good inventory performance recommendations to inform their ‘10 tips to Help Manage your Blood Product Inventory’ communications campaign started in 2016. In addition, an active link has been included on their national service website to enable access to the original</ins> <ins>Cranfield research \[S3&S4\]. The poster has been instrumental in reducing red blood cell wastage across the Australian service by 2.2% \(2016 to 2018\).</ins> 

 Bloodstock Levels and Wastage 

 <ins>The research on bloodstock levels proposed a segmented supply chain strategy for managing different blood groups, based on a novel blood group classification system. Research findings indicated that the less predictable the demand, the higher the wastage, particularly at hospital level. Applying the segmented strategy enabled NHSBT to focus management attention on those blood groups with the largest impact on overall wastage and</ins> <ins>potential for cost saving, while maintaining the alert level of three days stock cover for other groups. This work led directly to a 33% reduction in quantities held nationally, from approximately 60,000 units in 2013 to 40,000 in 2016. The application of the research also contributed to a reduction in wastage, the expiry rate reduced from 0.75% in 2013 to 2014 to 0.32% in 2015 to 2016. Consequently, less donations were required, and overall costs were reduced. This then led to a change in NHSBT national policy for bloodstock inventory levels</ins> <ins>\[S1\]</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 Logistics Service Provision 

 The simulation model developed of the logistics operation provided insights into the way in which the transport operation is run and made recommendations for improvements to charging mechanisms, fleet management, customer engagement and balancing in\-house and third\-party logistics providers. The work led directly to the introduction of a click and collect charge for non\-routine deliveries in 2017. The introduction of the charge has focused customers \(hospitals\) on making better use of their routine deliveries, with a consequent reduction in the use of the self\-collect service, reducing disruption for hospital services staff in blood centres who prepare products for despatch.  The delivery model has been refocussed, allowing a reduction in the size of the vehicle fleet, benefiting sustainability objectives \[S5\]. 

 “The introduction of the charge has helped to redress the balance of decreasing revenue against an increasing cost to provide.” <ins>\[S5\]</ins> 

 **Platelet Distribution Model** 

 <ins>The model developed by Cranfield was implemented in 2018 for the daily planning of platelets.  It provides an integrated decision support system for planning transportation and redistribution of platelets, considering perishability, substitution and transportation costs and is</ins> <ins>utilised</ins> <ins>daily by NHSBT. Implementing the tool, NHSBT been able to reduce costs of ad hoc transportation to rectify problems with stock distribution by 37%.  The tool led directly to a reduction in wastage, due to time expiry, of 1% and has been an enabler in a further reduction of 40%. Shortages in blood</ins> <ins>centres</ins> <ins>at 7am following distribution have reduced by 10% \[S6\].</ins>

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Responding to the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion and belief in services and employment \(Equality Act 2010\), Dinham and Baker created a Religion and Belief Policy Network, with the capacity to reach 25,000 professionals working in health and social care practices. Working with a core group of network participants, Dinham and Baker have co\-produced seven open\-access resources to support policy development and published new guidance with the Health Care Professions Council \(the regulator for nineteen health and social care professions\), who have a collective reach to every service provider in the UK. The education policy strand of the Network advised the Commission on Religious Education \(CoRE\) in 2018, leading to policy reform as regards the teaching of RE in schools in the United Kingdom \(UK\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Building on Earlier Foundations** 

 This programme of research emerges from Dinham’s earlier shaping of the notion of ‘religion and belief literacy’. In 2009 he was approached to direct a proposed HEFCE\-funded programme to address campus extremism, but recast the project to examine religion and belief in universities and the public sphere – an innovative turn which challenged the Islamo\-centrism of much of the public debate. HEFCE subsequently funded the ‘Religious Literacy in Higher Education’ programme, directed by Dinham, between 2010\-11 with £250k of resource \(G1\). A second phase was funded with an additional £81k between 2011\-13 and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission \(EHRC\) provided further funding of £32k to support the work in other public institutions between 2012\-13 \(G2\). The goal was to take the debate beyond binaries of ‘secular’ and ‘sacred’ to recognise that societies are complexly both \(R6\). Drawing on dialogue between his academic disciplines, formed in part through his earlier ESRC seminar series on Faith and Civil Society \(2007\-08\), the research led to an innovative academic connection between religion and belief and public policy. 

 **Challenging ‘Unconscious Secularity’** 

 Dinham and Baker’s more recent research responds to the hitherto largely unmet challenge that the Equality Act 2010 prohibits service providers and employers from discriminating on the grounds of religion and belief, to which organisations are largely un\-resourced to respond. Their research shows that the great majority of organisations have done little or nothing to operationalise this \(R2\). At the same time, their analysis shows how much of this is rooted in unconscious bias which sees religion and belief as problematic and risky, associated primarily with social conservatism and extremism \(R3\). The research also shows how secularity forms another important context, though this is an idea which is not well understood in public spaces and is often wrongly equated with some sort of neutrality, and with the decline of religion \(R4\). This makes it very difficult to convince policy and practice settings to engage in the first place and therefore it is a significant achievement in itself that the research opened up concrete pathways for the conversation, and developed work on this area with national policy bodies whose own policy\-making structures and timetables are large and unwieldy. The processes described here have demanded sustained engagement and a persuasive evidence base. 

 **Establishing an Evidence Base** 

 The research is rooted in three projects. The first project \(led by Dinham and Baker\) is funded by AHRC and revolves around the researchers’ observation that religion and belief are appearing in academic disciplines and professions which have never before, or not recently, been interested in them. The researchers asked ‘How are academic disciplines conceiving of religion and belief in contemporary scholarship and with what practice implications?’ They analysed treatments of religion and belief across nine Arts, Humanities and Social Science disciplines, undertook nineteen ‘landmark’ interviews with world\-leading scholars, and held a three\-day international interdisciplinary colloquia with a further twenty leading thinkers. They also took findings on an international ‘roadshow’ to Ottawa, Canada; Melbourne, Australia and Oslo, Norway, to test out their international transferability. Their analysis found a cross\-disciplinary preoccupation with: security, extremism and cohesion; equality and diversity; and the role of faiths in welfare service provision, especially health, social care, welfare and education \(R3, R4\). In a concluding workshop at the House of Lords, participants were facilitated to devise an agenda for action which identified the need for a network and policy tools. 

 **An Emerging Focus on Health and Social Care** 

 This paved the way for the second project, which received AHRC follow\-on funding, in which the researchers convened four events with senior policy\-makers \(London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast\) in the public professions, especially welfare and health and social care to identify biting points, concrete needs and inhibiting and enabling factors for policy change. The research in this phase was focused on leaders’ experiences of policy\-making processes in their organisations in terms of service user experience, service provider confidence and changes in policy\-makers’ attitudes and understandings of religion and belief. This resulted in four journal articles focusing on the gap between professional requirements to address religion and belief and training to do so in social work and other health and social care professions \(for example, \(R2\)\). 

 **Focusing in on Education Policy** 

 The third project \(led by Dinham\) focused specifically on education policy, seeking reform of school RE as a sustainable way of ensuring future generations are better able to engage with the contemporary religion and belief landscape. This was identified as a policy priority because of significant criticism of how existing RE largely fails to equip young people as future citizens and workforces in relation to religion and belief. Interviews were held with pupils, parents, teachers and employers \(n=319\) to ask about their understanding and hopes for the purpose, content and structure of learning about religion, not only within RE but across the whole school environment. Key findings were that 1\) there is a confusion of the educational, formational and confessional in relation to religion and belief in schools which muddles rather than clarifies thinking; 2\) that learning about religion and belief should take an elastic definition to include traditional \(world religions\), non\-traditional \(spiritual, informal\), revival \(wicca, pagan etc\), non\-religious beliefs \(like humanism, secularism and atheism\) and spiritual but not religious beliefs; and 3\) that learning should focus on religion and belief as the impact upon politics, media, social policy and sociology as well as theology and religious studies. The project resulted in three peer\-reviewed journal articles \(for example, R5\), one PhD thesis, a policy report, an executive summary report, and a monograph \(R1\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 From the outset the research was intended to lead to change by going beyond action research into intentional co\-production. This process began with Dinham and Baker’s observation from within existing practice networks that religion and belief was coming up more and more in places which had previously never thought about it. This was made visible through the Faiths and Civil Society Unit’s rolling programme of six annual public seminars on issues of practice and policy topicality and was mirrored in academic networks where religion and belief started to crop up in disciplines which had never, or not recently, engaged with it at all. 

 **Introducing a new Religion and Belief Policy Network** 

 Between 2014\-16, Dinham and Baker identified an agenda for change that would remedy the; 1\) dearth of resources and thinking spaces; 2\) desire for help with understanding the real religion and belief landscape; 3\) a call for help with framing policies that can best support religion and belief actors; and 4\) a call for provision of a regular, safe space to share new ideas and challenges in this sensitive area. Their work in the field led to a longer process of co\-production between 2018\-20 starting with an in\-principle commitment from project participants to create at least one policy change process in their organisation during the course of a year. **\[text removed for publication\].** During 2019 the researchers conducted a series of co\-production events with a sample of participants from across the initial network, including police chief constables, MSPs, senior civil servants, and diversity and equality leads in approximately 100 public bodies. A core group was drawn from this who worked together to produce policies, resources and tools that met the pre\-identified needs **\(S1\).** As a result of these events, participants across the programme, and beyond committed to the formation of a new Religion and Belief Policy Network, which was delayed by COVID but is currently under design using AHRC COVID extension funding. This takes the form of an online platform containing the new coproduced policy tools, case studies, vox pops, a searchable database of resources, a full project report and will also be the space for regular network online events. 

 **Reforming the RE curriculum in UK schools** 

 In 2015 Dinham co\-authored a policy report based on his research which included key policy recommendations outlining the need for a national commission on the future of teaching and learning about religion and belief in schools \(S2\). This was framed as part of a wider public policy issue that advocated that school leavers carry their understandings of religion and belief into their citizenship and workplaces. This recommendation informed the introduction of a national commission, **\[text removed for publication\];** 

 “In all, your work has significantly enabled the RE community in the UK – both educators and policy makers – not only to rethink what happens in schools but also how this impacts upon the rest of society as young people leave schools and go into workplaces and communities.” **\(S3\).** 

 The Commission on Religious Education \(CoRE\) sat from 2016\-17, during which time they reached the conclusion that there should be a new subject called Religion and Worldviews. This reflects all of the key findings in Dinham’s earlier work and is currently undergoing political consultation. This process is being facilitated by former Secretary of State for Education, the Rt Hon Charles Clarke, who is now Professor of Religion and Politics at Lancaster University and has worked closely with Dinham **\(S4\).** The Welsh Senedd have since formally changed the name of RE to Religion and Worldviews. This was announced in January 2021 with the update having been agreed in the period leading up to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020. 

 Dinham’s research has also been the subject of three APPG discussions \(December 2013; May 2016; April 2018\) **\(S5\)** with the result that, whether or not RE policy is reformed, the process has already informed the thinking of the RE community in Britain and Europe and instigated ‘buy in’ to a ‘religion and belief literacy’ approach which is becoming embedded in new classroom practices. **\[text removed for publication\]** **\(S6\).** A follow\-up project to identify and model innovative learning about religion and belief, led by Dinham, reflects CoRE’s recommendations and shares them across the UK and Europe. This has resulted in a series of online case studies which have been made available to the public **\(S7\).** Indicative of the growing interest in these initiatives, Dinham has participated in new ‘religion and belief literacy and RE’ networks that have arisen as a result in Finland, Norway and Sweden **\(S8\).** 

 Direct beneficiaries of the research include sector policy\-makers and their teams **\[text removed for publication\]** **\(S9\).** Educators in these professions benefit from the requirement to include aspects of religion and belief in their training curricula, and this in turn benefits newly qualifying professionals and their service users. Thus, wider beneficiaries are assumed to be health and social care service users, sector policy\-makers, and teachers and pupils in schools. This is predicated on a theory of change which sees policy change as the most effective and wide\-reaching place to start because it shapes training and therefore practice.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Western\-centric and economically driven design methods are not equipped to support and evaluate impact arising from social innovation initiatives within non\-Western cultures. They can inadvertently obscure, disrupt, or replace culturally specific practices and relationships during the design process. Research by Professor Joyce Yee of Northumbria University on culturally\-specific design approaches helped establish the Design and Social Innovation in Asia\-Pacific \(DESIAP\) network which has supported nearly 600 social innovation practitioners from 100 organisations in 14 countries. Yee’s research has enabled Asia\-Pacific organisations such as Re:public \(Japan\) who were already using design methods to establish a stronger professional identity as *design and social innovation* \(DSI\) practitioners. Her work on evaluation approaches \(for example with Impact Hub Phnom Penh\) has helped transform the way organisations use evaluation and has resulted in improved social outcomes for the marginalised and excluded communities they serve. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Design and Social Innovation \(DSI\) uses design methods to co\-create new ideas, services, and programmes to address social problems with the people who will use them. Traditionally, design methods have centred on unlocking economic potential, typically in Western\-based commercial organisations and contexts \(Europe and the United States\). In contrast, DSI initiatives that aim to create social impact are often delivered in communities by third and public sector organisations. Evaluating social impact is challenging as it is not measured through profit and market successes, but through changes in behaviour, systems, and policies that ultimately benefit an individual or a community. 

 Research led by Professor Joyce Yee from Northumbria University explored the value of design in supporting social innovation and investigated the most effective ways for DSI initiatives to create social impact. A key example was the AHRC\-funded project \[ **G1**\] that examined the impact of design in public, voluntary, and community sector organisations across England, Scotland, and Australia. Rather than focusing only on *how* design adds value, Yee uniquely looked at the conditions required to *maximise* this value and her research revealed that creating a community and building trusting relationships between all stakeholders is the most important condition for successful co\-creation in this context \[ **R1**\]. 

 Yee’s experience of living and working in the South\-east Asian region led her to be concerned that the dominance of Western\-centric DSI methods can inadvertently obscure, disrupt, or replace culturally\-specific practices and relationships during the design process, and impede the potential of successful DSI. Therefore in 2015, in collaboration with Dr Yoko Akama \(RMIT University, Australia\), Yee hosted a symposium and workshop on Design and Social Innovation in Asia\-Pacific \(DESIAP\) in Singapore. Akama’s expertise in participatory design and experiences with indigenous populations in Australia complemented Yee’s specialist understanding of innovation and social impact in design, particularly in community\-driven organisations \[ **R1**\]. The success of this event led to an AHRC network grant \[ **G2**\] that resulted in the foundation of the DESIAP Network – a virtual platform and community of practice to address the needs of oft\-overlooked organisations engaged in DSI within the region. DESIAP events designed to improve understanding of DSI in Asia\-Pacific countries included 3 international symposiums, 8 workshops, and 4 projects attracting nearly 600 participants in total. 

 Yee conducted research using insights from participants at DESIAP workshops in Singapore \(2015, 2019\), Bangkok \(2016\), Newcastle \(2016\), Yangon \(2017\), Phnom Penh \(2017\), Melbourne \(2017\), and Kuala Lumpur \(2017\). Findings revealed that respecting and understanding cultural sensitivities is key to fostering the trust and interdependent relationships with stakeholders that enable DSI practices to work successfully \[ **R2**\]. Yee’s research also highlighted that design practices need to be sensitive to a blend of cultures, relationships, materials, histories, philosophies, and world views to encourage inclusive practice and avoid domination by Western ideals \[ **R3**\]. Building on this, Yee and post\-doctoral researcher, Cyril Tjahja \(Hanzehogeschool Groningen, The Netherlands\) highlighted the positive influence of social hierarchy in participatory DSI in Thailand \[ **R4**\]. This conclusion challenges the potential negative perceptions of hierarchy in DSI derived from Western pre\-judgements. It illustrated the importance of more culturally\-specific and culturally\-grounded ways of working in DSI and provided an example of how it works in practice. 

 Yee’s research also highlighted how using a Western perspective to evaluate DSI in non\-Western contexts is inappropriate and proposed new culturally\-sensitive and transformative\-learning methods for evaluation \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. Yee and colleagues suggested that traditional quantitative evaluation fails to account for the long\-term impact related to social value and its potential to transform individuals \[ **R5**\]. A key example of this was the ‘DSI Social Impact Framework’, established in 2017 with input from 12 DSI practitioners from Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, and The Philippines. The new framework assessed changes in participant mindset and recommended the use of evaluation tools to share stories and learning, crowdsource opinions, explore unknowns, and develop shared understandings of impact. The framework encouraged DSI projects to embed community\-led evaluation from the start to help shape the project as it progresses and so maximise social impact \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact \(**indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Yee worked with over 100 organisations from 14 countries around the Asia\-Pacific region who support communities to deliver social innovation initiatives which led to 1\) the establishment of a professional identity for DSI practitioners and 2\) the transformation of professional evaluative practices for social impact. 

 **4.1 Establishment of a professional identity** 

 The organisations Yee worked with through the DESIAP Network address diverse social issues, but all adopt methods from the field of design in their work, although they have not always recognised these methods as DSI. Yee worked with 145 participants from these organisations through 8 DESIAP workshops to re\-frame and embed their work within design frameworks and concepts, providing an international platform to showcase their work and extend their reach. Furthermore, they cascaded their new understanding of design to their organisations and local communities, carving out a professional space to ensure their work \(and their use of design\) was recognised and valued by funding agencies. 

 Engagement with DESIAP resulted in a stronger professional identity for DSI practitioners. For example, Re:public \(Tokyo, Japan\) trains citizens to develop sustainable responses to social needs in their communities via city\-wide programmes. Fumiko Ichikawa, co\-founder and MD of Re:public, noted that working with DESIAP has *‘proved invaluable for us’* and resulted in them recognising and validating what they do as DSI: ‘ *We have been able to develop our own disciplinary specific language to make what we do accessible and recognisable as design and innovation in Japan…enabling us to gain a level of understanding about our work that we otherwise would not have been able to achieve’* \[ **E1**\]. 

 Demonstrating value is particularly important for emerging markets, such as in Myanmar. As Klaus Oberbauer, from Impact Hub Yangon explained, working with Yee ‘ *strengthened our perspective in how we use design in our programmes; gained knowledge in how other organisations use design and helped inform what we do next. \[It has\] given us a platform to share our work with other practitioners and with an international public \[…\] These changes have ultimately aided us to improve the support that we are able to offer the young entrepreneurs that we encounter’* \[ **E2**\]. 

 Between January 2019 and November 2020, 3631 users visited the DESIAP’s website \( [www.desiap.org](http://www.desiap.org/)\) from 108 countries, with 56% \(14/25\) of the top 25 countries based in the Asia\-Pacific region. Visitors from other parts of the world, including, USA, UK, Germany, and Canada also appear in the top 10 \[ **E3**\]. DSI practitioners value the website which offers inspiration, examples of good design practice, and provides connection to practitioners working in other countries; the resources page is the second most viewed \(1116 page views\) after the home page \[ **E3**\]. These resources have been used to support and argue for more culturally\-specific and culturally\-grounded ways of working in DSI. Penny Hagen, a co\-design lead in a public sector innovation team based in South Auckland, New Zealand noted: ‘ *I frequently refer to DESIAP in professional settings as a reference point for an alternative, local design practice and dialogue to counter and complement more dominant Western models’* \[ **E4**\]. 

 **4.2 Transformed practitioner and funder evaluative practices and improved delivery** 

 Traditionally, evaluation frameworks used to capture the social impact of design initiatives are limited, funder\-focused, and measured only against criteria defined at the outset, e.g., the number of new enterprises, or number of people trained. Yee’s work resulted in DSI practitioners and funders changing how they think about the social impact of their work within communities and informed the evaluation of specific programmes. Participation in a 2017 DESIAP event led one practitioner to identify ‘ *different levels of evaluative practice \(personal reflection, internal to the team, and with external partners\) and new methods of capturing audio/visual inputs’* \[ **E5**\]. 

 DESIAP’s new ‘DSI Social Impact Framework’ \[ **E6**\] provided professionals with an alternate evaluation framework that is suited to the relationship\-, community\-, and culture\-driven aspects of social innovation. The DESIAP Impact and Evaluation report published by Yee and collaborators \[ **E6**\] has been used to argue for changes in practices. A funder based in South and Southeast Asia, Nicky Wilkinson at Firetree Philanthropy, recognised that the framework *‘helps to surface and “crystallise” … a process that many of our partners are “inherently doing”/a way of working that is fundamental to how they approach designing and evaluating any intervention’* \[ **E7**\]. The report \[ **E6**\] was cited in Firetree’s blog describing their funding approach, where their Director of Philanthropy, Nicky Wilkinson, acknowledged that *‘we \[funders\] need to find alternative, more flexible ways of “reporting”’* \[ **E8,** p11\]. 

 Yee also worked with Impact Hub Phnom Penh on the evaluation of their CLEAR programme. The Hub provides entrepreneurship training to youths and CLEAR is an online course which trains and mentors young Cambodian leaders to help them develop culturally\-specific leadership skills. The programme trained 1,500 people \(March 2019 \- October 2020\) and was the Hub’s first to have a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan to inform future improvements; now an embedded approach to future programmes. The Hub’s co\-founder, Laura Smithman, explained that as a result, the programme content integrated ‘ *intentional steps of empathy building \[and…\] develop\[ed\] overarching mindsets in creative confidence and comfort with ambiguity’.* Further, she states ‘ *we now embed evaluation in the development of our current programmes… by planning the evaluation at the start… \[and we…\] monitor participant responses’.* This design\-led evaluation plan proved effective when the Hub needed to move one of their programmes quickly to virtual delivery, in response to Covid\-19, and they used participant feedback to ‘ *enable* *rapid participant\-informed adaptation to this new format’* \[ **E9**\]. 

 The impact of Yee’s research also reached beyond the Asia\-Pacific region, in contexts where DSI is being utilised to address localised issues. The DESIAP Impact and Evaluation report \[ **E6**\] led the Tower Hamlets Communities Driving Change \(CDC\) programme team at The Young Foundation \(based in the UK\) to change how impact is measured in their work. Through training delivered by Yee to 8 team members \(July – Dec 2020\), they explored alternative forms of evaluation that were then embedded within the programme and wider organisation through new individual and team\-based reflective practices. This changed how the team understood and evidenced the social impact of their work \[ **E10**\]. \[text removed for publication\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The tyre remains one of the most challenging areas of computer modelling. The state\-of\-the\-art modelling procedure described here, follows 20 years of research into the modelling of tyre behaviour to support computer\-based design simulation. This has involved collaborations with the automotive and aerospace sectors. The main impact is based on a research project carried out with Jaguar Land Rover \(JLR\) between 2014 and 2017. This work investigated efficient methods for tyre testing and has resulted in a significant reduction in overall tyre test duration in the order of 72% and a saving in the order of £800k per annum. The procedure is the first of its kind and is now firmly established in the design and development process at JLR.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Greater automotive industry commitment to active safety, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and the development of autonomous vehicles with on\-board computational vehicle dynamics algorithms, demands evermore use of tyre models. In turn, this drives the need for expensive laboratory testing to understand tyre behaviour and to generate data for computer models. The testing modelling of the tyre is one of the most scientifically challenging areas for the virtual design of both aircraft and automotive vehicles. 

 Professor Blundell’s investigations into the computer simulation of automotive vehicle dynamics tests, began at Coventry University \(CU\) in 2000. Collaborative work with Rover and Dunlop, explored how tyres are tested in a laboratory to obtain data and parameterise tyre models for use in a vehicle dynamics simulation \(R1\). 

 Between 2003 and 2006, Blundell collaborated with Harty at Prodrive and published a new low parameter tyre model \(R2\), used to simulate the Subaru Rally car in race conditions. The model was shown to be accurate, when compared with measured test data, and is now globally available after being implemented in the commercially available Optimum\-Tire  [http://www.optimumg.com/software/optimumtire/](http://www.optimumg.com/software/optimumtire/) toolkit. 

 Between 2008 and 2014, Blundell worked on collaborative projects with the aerospace sector, where his automotive knowledge was transferred to develop aircraft tyre models to simulate take\-off, landing, runway taxiing manoeuvres and hard emergency landings. Work involved a European funded FP6 project with Eurocopter \(R3\), an EPSRC funded project with Airbus \(R4\) and supervised PhD projects with Dunlop Aircraft Tyres and Augusta Westland \(R5\). 

 Blundell’s work into tyre modelling culminated in 2015, with a collaborative project with JLR to address the problem of the large number of tyres and laboratory test procedures required to obtain the test data needed to populate tyre models, used in the vehicle dynamics simulation models, employed by JLR’s design and project teams. These machines are typically large, expensive, laboratory\-based installations, such as the Calspan flat\-bed \(shown in Figure 1\) tyre test machine in Buffalo, USA, used in this study to investigate the efficient modelling and testing of tyres \(R6\). 

 This work supports the use of computer simulation models, or virtual prototypes, to analyse the performance of new vehicle designs before a physical prototype is built. Computer models are used to simulate the development tests carried out with real vehicles and prototypes, on or off road and at the proving ground. The design areas addressed are vehicle dynamics, ride comfort, safety and durability, an area of design simulation activity expanding rapidly, with the evolution of autonomous vehicles. 

 The new test procedure, used a novel approach that considered the time tyres spend in different conditions to optimise the test periods for these conditions, rather than traditional methods, that attempt to map the complete envelope of tyre behaviour. This streamlined approach, developed exclusively with JLR and used there for the first time, has proved highly impactful at JLR.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Testing vehicles at the proving ground only takes place after extensive validation of the tyre design using computer\-based virtual prototypes. The tyre models used are mathematically complex and can have a large range of parameters. In order to parameterise the tyre models used in simulations, an extensive range of physical tyre tests must be performed using specialised test rigs and laboratories. A typical test to parameterise just one tyre model, can degrade 18 prototype tyres and take 14.5 hours of rig time. A typical annual spend on tyre testing for JLR, would be in excess of £1.1million. 

 Like many leading manufacturers in the automotive sector, JLR is working to increase its use of computer simulations and virtual prototypes in the design and development of their vehicles. JLR’s commitment to a virtual engineering\-led approach is already defining how current and future models are being designed. Around 40 percent of the design and performance requirements for JLR vehicles are already verified using virtual simulation tools and have an aspiration to achieve100 percent virtual engineering. The novel approach to tyre\-testing developed here is the first of its kind and represents a significant step towards achieving this aim, within one of the most challenging areas of computer modelling in car design\- tyre testing. 

 The pathway to impact was established through a direct collaboration between Coventry University and JLR. JLR approached Blundell due to his long\-established and respected background in empirical tyre modelling, extending back over 30 years. The JLR tyre modelling group make regular use of Calspan to carry out the challenging testing required to parameterise the tyre models needed by the design and development groups at JLR. 

 As a direct result of the findings of this research collaboration, JLR changed its design processes to adopt the novel and significantly more efficient approach to tyre testing. This change enabled JLR to reduce the volume of experimental testing required to parameterise tyre models, carried out using the Calspan tyre test facility in the USA.  Consequently, this led to a substantial reduction in the costs involved in this testing process. JLR have acknowledged the fundamental role that Coventry University played in this research \(S1\). The ability for JLR to generate more tyre models and to expand the use of simulation, which has resulted from the impact of this work, has enhanced the design process and led to safer and higher performing vehicles. On completion of the programme, it was clear that the novel process would deliver a significant and ongoing commercial impact at JLR. 

 *“The work you carried out with us has produced efficient tyre lab test methods for JLR that are now in use, yielding excellent results with a reduction in overall tyre testing duration in the order of 72%. Financially, the output from this work has had the biggest impact on JLR of any of our collaborations, due to the huge cost savings in the order of £800k per annum that the work produced. This means that we are able to obtain more test data and to improve the amount and quality of our tyre models.” \(S1\)* 

 These savings – £0.8M per year – represent a major breakthrough in JLR’s mission towards a total virtual design environment, that reaps the commercial advantage of lower testing costs, whilst continuing to improve vehicle performance and advance safety standards.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Elliott’s research on the Bannatyne Manuscript \(c. 1568\) and its role in inspiring later anthologies, *Ever Green* \(1724\) and *Evergreen* \(1894\-6\), demonstrates the anthology’s function as a format enabling the expression of collective identity, and illuminates the influence of the Bannatyne Manuscript on Edinburgh’s cultural heritage. It motivated the publication of a new anthology of creative work, *The Evergreen: A New Season in the North* \(4 vols., 2014\-19\), which has played a significant role in Edinburgh Old Town Development Trust’s work to preserve Edinburgh’s built and cultural heritage by catalysing relationships between social enterprise and the academic humanities, directly supporting artistic practice and fostering new understandings of how cultural heritage can meet community needs.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Bannatyne Manuscript \(1568\) initiates a distinctive and enduring tradition, in which the anthology as a format plays an important role in defining complex, diverse, and yet unified conceptions of Scottish identity. Elliott’s research traces the importance of the Bannatyne for the development of conceptions of Scottish and British identity after the Union, and its ongoing contribution to culture and community in Edinburgh. 

 **The Bannatyne anthology** 

 Elliott’s research \[2\-5\] stems from a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship \(2011\-2014; \[P1\]\) on the cultural afterlife of the Bannatyne Manuscript \( *c.* 1568\), a poetic anthology in English and Scots compiled by Edinburgh merchant George Bannatyne. Elliott’s work focuses on the anthology’s role in facilitating the development of individual and collective identities, first as an expression of its maker’s identity, then as a symbol of Scottish nationalism and elite male culture. 

 Elliott’s research on the Bannatyne Manuscript highlights the role of individual poems in promoting conceptions of Scottish identity that encompass cultural diversity. Her contribution to the AHRC\-funded History of Distributed Cognition project \(2014\-18\) examines the *Flyting* of Dunbar and Kennedy \( *c*. 1508\) \[1\]. Later published in Ramsay’s *Ever Green* \(1724\), this poem makes Edinburgh the backdrop for an argument addressing Scottish identity and its relationship to Gaelic and English language cultures. Uniting conflicting viewpoints in a single work of art keyed to the urban landscape, the *Flyting* supports the work of imagining Scotland as a diverse community \(Elliott, 2019\). 

 **Bannatyne’s Cultural Legacy** 

 Elliott’s research further charts the Bannatyne’s influence on Edinburgh’s cultural landscape: the poet Allan Ramsay \(1686\-1758\) published poems from the anthology as *The Ever Green* \(1724\), fuelling the revival of Scots as a literary language \[2\-5\]. The Bannatyne Club \(1823\-61\), a gentleman’s antiquarian printing society founded in Edinburgh by the poet, novelist, and historian Sir Walter Scott, made George Bannatyne the figurehead for their mission to publish ‘works illustrative of the History, Topography, Poetry, and Miscellaneous Literature of Scotland’. Commemorating their past, the membership endorsed a distinctive Scottish identity, in tension with the homogenising influence of political Union \(Elliott 2016\). Marking a further stage in the Bannatyne’s reception, the town planner and conservationist Patrick Geddes published *The Evergreen* \(4 vols., 1895\-7\), celebrating his development of the site of Ramsay’s former home on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile as housing for artisans, students, and academics. 

 Elliott’s study is the first to contextualise these responses to Bannatyne as part of an interconnected and distinctive tradition of particular importance for Edinburgh. Her collaboration with Edinburgh Old Town Development Trust \(EOTDT, 2012\-present\) began as an attempt to take account of the ongoing influence of the Bannatyne tradition in the present. 

 In response to Elliott’s research, and at her instigation, EOTDT published a new series, *The Evergreen: A New Season in the North* \(4 vols, 2014\-19\), as a conscious addition to the Bannatyne tradition, using the anthology format to articulate a dynamic, yet coherent community identity. Elliott’s contributions to the project and her role on the editorial board helped shape the direction of EOTDT’s project, while her ongoing research recognises EOTDT’s work as evidence of the vitality of the Bannatyne tradition and its present significance.

 Illuminating the tradition stemming from the Bannatyne Manuscript, Elliott’s research was the locus for EOTDT’s venture into community publishing. *The Evergreen: A New Season in the North*, is a four\-volume anthology of poetry, prose, and visual art \(E1\-E4, 2014\-19\) involving 85 contributors and intended as an Evergreen for the 21<sup>st</sup> century \[S1\]. The anthology created a new space for writers and artists to explore key themes, including place, identity and community. It has supported EOTDT to achieve its aims by increasing community participation and creative partnerships, contributed to EOTDT’s income, and fostered new understandings of how cultural heritage can meet community needs. 

 **Co\-creating a new anthology for the 21st Century** 

 According to EOTDT’s director, Sean Bradley, ‘ *the idea behind The Evergreen can be described simply: if you connect the people to the place in which they live – its history, natural environment, and culture – you encourage them to become more active and responsible citizens’* \[S2\]. Elliott proposed a new Evergreen as a pilot project for EOTDT community publishing collective, The Word Bank. A new Evergreen matched EOTDT’s commitment to preservation of Edinburgh’s built and cultural heritage, and the growth of community participation and the arts. Patrick Geddes’ work as an urban planner and conservationist was already an acknowledged inspiration for EOTDT, but Elliott’s research made the connection between development and the Evergreen. Bradley notes that, ‘ *Not only did it provide an essential reference point for the framing of the subsequent publishing project, but it was an essential guide to how the 4 volumes developed, including the accompanying community learning programme*’ \[S2\]. 

 **Stimulating Community Participation and Learning** 

 The project contributed to EOTDT’s own formation and its ethos for engaging with its community. As a member of EOTDT’s board testifies, ‘ *The process of publishing the Evergreen proved to be an important one in the formation of \[EOTDT\] in itself \[…\] This process helped the EOTDT to develop its own constitution and ways of working*’ \[S4\]. Consultation with stakeholders was built into the development process, with initial meetings in 2013, followed by a consultative workshop \(2015\), attended by representatives of Scottish Historic Buildings Trust, Workers’ Educational Association, the Patrick Geddes Centre, Patrick Geddes Memorial Trust, Edinburgh Printmakers, and academics. Elliott secured funding \[P2\] to support this consultation and a community learning programme, raising awareness of the project through public lectures hosted at the NLS and University of Edinburgh and a free poetry writing workshop \(2015\). 

 For contributor Petra Reid, ‘ *The workshop had the effect of sparking my consciousness into reclaiming the physical and historical significance of the Old Town for me as a citizen of Edinburgh*’. This began as ‘ *an intensive few weeks of research into street life of the Old Town, which culminated in my contribution’*. Discovering ‘ *amazing historical accounts of the Old Town made me far more invested in the Old Town as a real place, while engagement with the work of Geddes continues to inform my practice as a writer*’. For her contribution to *Evergreen* Volume 2, inspired by Elliott’s research on how ‘Ramsay and Geddes “ventriloquised” historical poets’, Reid  ‘ *had the idea of ventriloquising the ventriloquists. Therefore, this device, voicing a contemporary female figure to give rejoinder to both historic \[and\] present sexual inequalities, was directly influenced by LE’s \[Elizabeth Elliot’s\] piece*’ \[S5\]. 

 The project also created models of community activism, conservation, development, and culture for an international context. The 85 writers and artists commissioned for the anthology include contributors from India, Italy, the USA, and Spain. Open calls for submissions were circulated via social media and EOTDT’s website, with commissions ‘geared to ensuring quality and equality attracting new as well as established writers and contributions in minority languages’ \[S3\]. As editor of Volume 4 and prizewinning novelist Lucy Ellmann states, ‘ *Geddes’s own vision was far\-reaching – he and his work travelled, and we wanted the same for the new Evergreen*’ \[S6\]. Sales figures are noted below, with users of the project website estimated at 6000 \[S3\]. 

 For Bradley, Elliott’s collaboration with the EOTDT has modelled new ways of working and new possibilities for community engagement and cross\-sector collaboration. ‘ *The project as a whole offers a new and highly innovative model for productive collaboration between the academic humanities and social enterprise \[…\] The Evergreen has contributed to making productive connections between organisations and individuals with shared interests and has made a direct contribution to supporting creative work*’ \[S3\]. 

 **Contributing to Edinburgh Old Town Development Trust’s Financial Sustainability** 

 Elliott’s collaboration with EOTDT also had economic impact, contributing to EOTDT’s income through grant awards and direct sales. Elliott has worked with the Trust to secure GBP37,000 grant funding related to the anthology project. Creative Scotland awarded EOTDT GBP25,000 \(2014\) for initial development and publication of the anthology, as high\-quality work with a clearly\-described public outcome. Funding from the Saltire Society \(GBP2,000\) and Edinburgh World Heritage \(GBP1,000\) supported the commissioning process \[S3\]. Additionally, as of 29/6/2020, 1184 books have been sold, generating GBP10,071.18 \[S3\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Crafting the Future \(CtF\) research group has impacted on the social and economic development of multiple traditional craft communities in India and Thailand, leading to an increase in social wellbeing and economic sustainability. By developing the artisan beneficiaries’ cultural practices through strategies of collaboration and co\-creation, marginalised individuals and communities have been empowered; cultural identities have been revived; new cultural production has been created; and new markets and audiences generated. Supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\), the British Council, and Arts Council England \(ACE\), international exhibitions of the co\-created outcomes have directly engaged 511 creative participants and reached global audiences of over 300,000. This has increased the profile of disappearing practices and marginalised communities, whilst simultaneously promoting cross\-cultural collaboration within the beneficiary nations and internationally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Crafting the Future \(CtF\) research group, based in the Manchester School of Art Research Centre, has developed a shared ethos towards revitalising indigenous crafts, and has delivered practice\-based research projects in collaboration with artisans and organisations since 2007. Several research outputs \(reported in the case study ‘Crafting the Contemporary’ in REF 2014\), including the *Here and There* \(HAT\) project \(2007\) **\[1\]**, *Design Camp* \(2008\), *Cotton Exchange* \(2012/3\), *Field to Fashion* \(2013\) **\[2\]** and *Warli* \(2013\) **\[3\]** initiated experimental research strategies underpinned by the principles of collaboration and exchange. These strategies culminated in an innovative artist’s residency model, which was prototypical in formulating the methodology underpinning our ongoing CtF research. 

 The critical need for such a pro\-active engagement with traditional craft practices and practitioners was established by the AHRC\-funded *Design Routes* \(2017\) project, led by Professor <ins>Evans</ins>, which established a typology of strategies for revitalising culturally\-significant designs, products and practices **\[4\].** The research revealed that many designs and products are associated with specific places, employ traditional processes and are embedded in local ways of life. Many of these culturally\-significant indigenous crafts have fallen out of step with contemporary society, thus becoming marginalised. *Design Routes* promoted an ongoing reassessment and revitalisation of these crafts, attesting to their enduring importance in shaping cultural identity, and promoting wellbeing and environmental stewardship. This research, with its focus on creative ecologies of place, established the critical framework that informed the practice\-based research subsequently undertaken by members of the CtF group. 

 Subsequent CtF projects have created opportunities for designer\-makers to spend time as artists\-in\-residence, collaborating closely with traditional artisans to generate a body of experience, knowledge and critical exchange, which has led to sustained collaborative relationships between makers, arts organisations and creative communities. 

 ACE\-funded *Reimagine India* project *Heart:Beat* \(2017\), led by <ins>Dixon</ins> in collaboration with the Clay Foundation, brought together an interdisciplinary team of artists and organisations from the UK and India to undertake a multi\-media residency, exploring the cultural tensions resulting from India’s rapid urbanisation. Film, sound and visual artists, and creative writers, from the UK collaborated with researchers from CEPT \(formerly the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology\) University in Ahmedabad, and Indian artists and artisans, to explore sustainability strategies for traditional crafts, focusing specifically on Warli painting from the Palghar District in Maharashtra. Operating within the context of the Warli community’s traditions of pictorial narrative, the local and visiting artists created new artworks, which brought the cultural ‘heartbeat’ of the Warli’s fragile rural environment to new audiences in India and the UK **\[5\]**. 

 <ins>Dixon</ins>, <ins>Welsh</ins> and <ins>Chadprajong\-Smith</ins> worked in collaboration with the British Council on the Tai Lue Project, which developed methods of empowering female weavers in Nan Province, Thailand, enabling the women to realise the creative and business potential of their hand\-loomed textiles. The project investigated methods of equipping the weavers with knowledge in design thinking, and new methods of integrating their cultural identity into their cloth. A programme of intensive and extensive participatory design workshops was initiated, which ran intermittently over a three\-year period. Through daily meetings and practical workshops, with a specific focus, such as design awareness, pattern\-cutting and natural dyeing, the weavers’ design thinking gradually evolved. The research revealed the need to re\-think the weavers’ product promotion, to create new commercially viable garments, and to ensure that their business model maximised the economic potential of their environmentally\-friendly hand\-dyed fabrics. The research also identified a need to explore methods of encouraging a new generation of skilled designers, weavers and businesswomen to engage with the craft. **\[6,7\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Ctrafting the Future has promoted the cultural, social and economic revival of indigenous craft practices and the empowerment of their practitioners, most significantly with the Warli painting community in Maharashtra, and with weaving communities in Gujarat and Nan Province, Thailand. 

 Warli painting is a form of tribal art practised by the tribal people from the North Sahyadri Range in Maharashtra, India. Building upon networks formed during the HAT project, Magee’s cultural collaboration with Warli painters was consolidated through the filming of *Warli* \(2013\), which focussed on the Warli master painter, Jivya Soma Mashe, and laid the groundwork for the *Heart:Beat* project *.* The objective of the *Heart:Beat* residency \(2017\) was to assess the cultural significance, and address the sustainability, of a traditional but marginalised craft practice, currently threatened by India’s rapid globalisation, industrialisation and rural depopulation. *Heart:Beat* culminated in an exhibition and installation that attracted an audience of over 1,000 people, including 350 schoolchildren who participated in the event, many from the local Warli community, with others coming from as far afield as Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Jaipur **\[A\]**. An initial craft\-mapping exercise conducted by researchers from CEPT University in Ahmedabad had established the fragility of this marginal cultural practice, identifying a core cohort of only 22 Warli painters in Thane Province. In addressing this, the residency exhibition brought together the wider creative community for the first time, and a further 28 painters were identified through their participation in the open exhibition, raising the profile of their practice. The exhibition also brought to light a small but significant number of female Warli painters returning to the practice, which had become dominated by men in recent years. Warli painter Ramesh Hengadi, a participant in both *the Hat Project and Heart:Beat,* commented on how these projects had initiated collaborative curatorial partnerships, which have increased the visibility and financial viability of Warli painting, creating new networks and opportunities for young painters: “AYUSH \(Adivasi Yuva Shakti\) got connected to me and with other local Warli artists. AYUSH has been there as an organisation since 10\-12 year, but they did not do paintings earlier. They were more into farming, due to the Heart Beat project now they got the idea about painting and take it as a production and spread it in the entire region as they already had a network \[…\] I have been given a role in this project, that of a senior artist. I train young artists and also contribute to orders based production. AYUSH have opened a small gallery in Khabala village, towards Dhanu. They also have an office in Waghadi \(near my in\-laws’ place\).  I sometimes provide them my paintings. There are different coordinators within this organisation. It is a good project for wage based employment of young generation” **\[B\]**. 

 For *Heart:Beat*, new paintings were commissioned from ten Warli artists, exploring the themes of modernisation, transition, and environmental and cultural sustainability, and these works were exhibited alongside those of the artists\-in\-residence. Hengadi commented on how the project had influenced and invigorated his creative practice: “I am more involved in bringing a life and soul to paintings. I am in search of old stories, that are in songs, I want to depict them as painting, Warli stories that have not been depicted in paintings before. I am giving birth to new paintings never done before” **\[B\].** Further exhibitions of the work in Ahmedabad; Jaipur; Wellbeck; Stoke\-on\-Trent and Rochdale have introduced Warli painting to new audiences, numbering 34,794, stimulating cultural tourism across the sites of the touring exhibition, and attracting national and international visitors, whilst also supporting local economies and tourism in Maharashtra **\[C\].** In 2018, the project was further disseminated in the form of an artist’s book, *Heart:Beat,* which was produced in a limited edition of 200 **\[D\]**. 

 In *Field to Fashion,* <ins>Welsh</ins> developed environmentally\-sustainable strategies, which focussed on the preservation of organic ‘old\-world’ kala cotton grown by marginalised farmers in rural Gujarat, India, where production was being abandoned as the yarn diminished in demand. There was an identified need to stimulate an Indian market for locally\-grown cotton without the pressures of external influences. *Field to Fashion* instigated a collaborative international design process with an Indian master weaver, which exposed new cultural products to new international audiences. Today, kala cotton products have become successfully re\-established on the international wholesale and retail markets. The Director of NGO Khamir stated: “Alison Welsh has been a part of the success story of kala cotton … since its early inception in 2013. Alison worked with Khamir, the organization that developed the kala cotton as a farm\-to\-fabric story at a time when it was just being introduced and tested in the market \[…\] Alison saw the potential right away and decided to work closely with Shamjibhai Vishram Siju \[…\] to develop garments and product possibilities.\[…\] This was an important early step that led to the story of kala cotton being broadcast outside of Kutch and India \[…\] Since 2013, kala cotton has truly become a dynamic co\-creating ecosystem where many components have engaged and interacted with one another to bring about a transformation in just 7\-8 years. Many weavers who had left their traditional occupation for factory jobs, have actually returned back to the fold. And most importantly, the young weavers see hope for their future and their craft. In this journey, Alison and other designers have played an important role to give it not only the initial push but also to keep touching base, whenever required, with a legacy that has now taken a life of its own.”’ **\[E\]**. 

 Similarly, the *Tai Lue Weavers* project \(2018\) promoted a sustained engagement with weaving villages in Nan Province, Thailand, many of which were also on the brink of abandoning their cultural heritage, having adopted chemical dyes and synthetic yarns without great commercial success. The project re\-introduced eco\-friendly practices into the cotton\-growing, spinning, dyeing, weaving and garment construction stages of the Tai Lue weaving tradition, and led to the co\-design and co\-production of new garment ranges using handwoven Tai Lue fabrics. Some of these ranges were co\-created with the weavers themselves to develop contemporary garments that demonstrated the design possibilities of traditional Tai Lue weaving. <ins>Welsh</ins> and <ins>Chadprajong\-Smith</ins> worked closely with the leaders of three community enterprises, representing 52 women in Tai Lue province. Workshops taught both hard and soft skills, including pattern\-cutting, garment construction, design and colour workshops, and organic dyeing techniques **\[F\]**. The project also brought in young Thai designers and entrepreneurs to collaborate in the creation and marketing of new textile products. The workshops attracted a total of 58 participants, who commented on how the workshops had changed their practice. Thanom Teekawong, a farmer, weaver and Head of Ban Donchai Weaving Community Enterprise, confirmed that: “There is for sure opportunity. The entire group has benefited. They got an opportunity to upgrade their skills, design process, shop and display arrangement. We also got to go on study trips. We learnt pattern making. We have learnt so many things” **\[F\]**. 

 The project re\-ignited the weavers’ passion for their weaving heritage and demonstrated its economic potential for contemporary textiles businesses. Jiraphat Changlek, a weaver, tailor and store manager at Ban Donchai observed, “We see the opportunity to make ready\-to\-wear garments. We adapt traditional patterns and make them more contemporary... We see business opportunities and new markets. We have more orders of textiles. Many customers from other districts order natural colour dyed textiles” **\[G\]**. Jiraphat also states that the weavers are gaining a higher price for their products, “We earn more than we did before. … Before a shirt that was normal shirt was THB800\-850, now with added hand\-weaving and hand\-stitching details, the price is THB1,200\-1,500 depending on the pattern” **\[G\]**. 

 Furthermore, the project has elevated the weavers’ profile, nationally and internationally, through conferences, publications, exhibitions, festivals and online presence. Since her interview, conducted by the Tai Lue project media partner, The Cloud Magazine, five television programmes have focused on the success of Phaeo Phafai’s business \(with a total of 20,843 views on YouTube\). “The situation of our community has changed. Because our products are better, and we could sell for higher price. So, we have more resources to hire more people to work with us and they earn good income and more people join our network” **\[G\]**. 

 An audience of more than 100,000 visitors attended Chiang Mai Design Week, where the Tai Lue garments were exhibited in December 2018 **\[H\]**. Andrew Glass, Director of British Council, Thailand, stated: “Through her design\-thinking workshops as well as her advice given to artisans individually and as a group, Alison enabled the artisans to have a better understanding about the design process. Artisans are now able to see that design is part of the making process and can incorporate new ideas into the design of new products. This includes working on colour combination, natural dyes, and shop front displays, which help improve the design as well as brand images and marketing, which were new concepts to them. Alison's approach to design and making allows artisans to appreciate and build on their weaving traditions and hand skills. Her design work for the project focuses on bringing out the intricate details of the weaving combined with hand skills and slow making. Artisans then have an opportunity to see making in a different light and value their skills and heritage more. This also gives them a better understanding about the value of crafts and encourages them to continue with the crafts within their communities” **\[I\]**. A video film documenting the Tai Lue Project, and its impact on the women weavers of Nan Province, was premiered at a \(COVID19 compliant\) online event on 6<sup>th</sup> October 2020. The event featured a panel discussion by project participants and key international stakeholders, and was attended by an international audience of designers, makers, researchers, cultural theorists and curators. The film was selected from over 1,000 entries from 60 countries for screening at the Fashion Film Festival Milano, 13\-18 January 2021 **\[J\]**. 

 Collectively, the innovative collaborative strategies initiated and tested in the field by Crafting the Future researchers have brought real\-world benefits to the many indigenous crafts\-makers and communities of practice with whom they have worked. This activity has generated new international attention for the unique and, often undervalued, skills of traditional artisans, and has created cultural sustainability in a time of accelerating urbanisation and global uncertainty.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research emerged out of Tarlo’s and Tucker’s collaborative interdisciplinary practice. Tarlo’s contribution to, 'radical landscape poetry' was first established through her anthology, *The Ground Aslant* \(Shearsman 2011\), and her  poetry publications. Both participants drew on theoretical research in ecopoetics; phenomenology; new materialism; psychogeography and walking and fieldwork studies, areas of the environmental humanities in which they have significant individual and joint ongoing publication histories \[ **R3**, **R4**\].This research underpinned site\-based fieldwork which produced an extensive, ongoing exhibition history \[ **R1**\]. Viewed together, Tarlo’s texts and Tucker’s paintings/drawings enabled diverse audiences at home and abroad to examine intimate relationships between people and place, understand the 'naturalcultural' balance of our environment \(Haraway\) and thus the importance of all citizens’ responses to ecological change at a local and global level. The two fieldwork locations in Northeast Lincolnshire considered here were chosen for their relevance to such debates about land stewardship: 

####  *Outfalls* \(2015 \-2018\) 

 This project focused on the now defunct Louth Canal, exploring the past, present and possible futures of the Navigation, thus raising questions repeated all around the country about what should happen to these relics of our industrial heritage and surrounding landscapes? How would potential restoration affect the canal? How much and what kind of intervention is desirable and how might the arts contribute to local decision making in relation to environmental concerns, place value and well\-being? These research questions were explored in Tarlo's and Tucker's series of atmospheric drawings and poems, some of the latter based on stories told by local inhabitants. 

####  *Project Fitties* \(2013 ongoing\) 

 The Humberston Fitties \(over 300 chalets near the seaside town of Cleethorpes but visited by many more from nearby Northern towns\) is one of the last remaining functioning plotlands in a country where many once flourished. During the period of research, it was under threat, from east coast tidal surges and from the transition from public to private ownership, raising fears that its heritage and environmental status would be undermined. Here flood risk, community resilience and land stewardship were key issues. How could local people value, maintain and sustain the 'naturalcultural' heritage of their unique residence and how could artistic practice contribute to this? Tarlo and Tucker produced paintings and landscape poems situating the Fitties in the wider Site of Special Scientific Interest \(SSI\) marshes and beach shown alongside more intimate paintings of individual chalets accompanied by poems based on residents’ chalet names and found poems based on community\-written memory cards and interviews. 

 Both projects were longitudinal, facilitating extensive public engagement and community debate and exploring how such issues relate to class, marginalisation, taste and aesthetics \[ **R2**\]. Research, fieldwork, engagement with stakeholders, creative practice and critical analysis operated symbiotically from inception to process to reception and produced new creative outputs \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. These projects showcase methods for achieving consultation with local inhabitants over landscape decisions via interdisciplinary artistic practice around place, history, memory and present and future concerns and contribute to the development of the environmental arts and humanities as it moves beyond single disciplines into innovative interdisciplinary research and impact in response to the urgency of environmental change.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 These projects: 

####  Increased the value placed on marginalised areas 

 Throughout the *Outfalls* project Tarlo and Tucker, worked with the Louth Navigation Trust \(LNT\)to organise twelve events. For example, for ‘Visions of and for the Louth Canal’ the researchers invited members of the LNT, Hubbards Hills Trustees, Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, the Mayor of Louth, and members of the public to view their exhibition at the canal warehouse and invited them to discuss their differing priorities. As a direct result a small grant was given by the Mayor to the LNT to support preservation work. Local relations and sense of collective place value were improved \- “ *sometimes seeing the place through someone else's eyes makes you cherish it even more*"" and *“I hadn’t realised how much of backdrop the canal has provided and how its informed where my family has grown \- until I visited the exhibition*” \[ **E3**\]. The project contributed to preservation of the sites concerned, mobilised community action, and fostered increased value of these marginalised areas, and the subsequent wellbeing of inhabitants. 

####  Stimulated community engagement in local history and ecology 

 The chair of the Fitties Community Interest Company \(CIC\) writes “ *Project Fitties work in 2016 highlighted both the history and ecological importance of The Fitties Chalet Park to a wide audience from our chalet dwellers to a much wider global community*."" She acknowledges that the formation of the CIC in 2016 was directly influenced by *Project Fitties* as was their agenda, especially its environmental emphasis and successful campaign to retain the Fitties’ conservation status \[ **E1**\].  The CIC used text and image from the project in their representations to the new owners of the site. A local resident commented on how the project had helped community cohesion: “ *People have come together and stopped arguing as much*”. Again, place value increased: “ *It has been a stunning piece of work and benefited so many with pride and enjoyment*” and “ *Really interesting combination of images and words … I will think a little differently of the Fitties now when I walk the dog each Sunday morning through there*.” \[ **E2**\]. 

####  Increased engagement and awareness of environmental issues through arts\-led approaches 

 The Groundwork Gallery, Kings Lynn, the first and only gallery in the U.K. to be devoted to the environment, invited Tarlo and Tucker to organise and host a study day in 2018 entitled ""Conserve? Restore? Re\-wild? art & ecopoetics rise to the challenge"" on how local projects such as *Outfalls* relate to macro issues around rewilding. This attracted 40 specialist speakers and participants from around the U.K. including writers, artists, scientists, interested public and representatives from The National Trust and Wildlife Trust. Feedback forms stated that the event “crystallised some key issues” \(Norfolk\), was “ *hugely inspiring*” \(Bristol\) and that the mix of scientists and artists produced “ *surprising perspectives*” \(Birmingham\). Similar public events took place all over the country \(Cambridge, Torrington, London, Hull\) bringing publicity to the projects and to Northeast Lincolnshire and focusing on environmental issues raised \[ **E10**\]. 

####  Opened up access to arts and culture for hard\-to\-reach audiences 

 A range of thirty\-five events in varied venues \(including libraries, galleries, outdoor industrial spaces, and guided walks\) took arts to audiences who would not normally have accessed them. A local curator writes that the work “Encouraged pride and esteem in our area; we are in an isolated county, area of low cultural provision and aspiration"". Local reach was high. For example, the Excavations and Estuaries Exhibition outreach events at Grimsby Fishing Heritage Centre in 2014 attracted 115 participants, a live audience of 2,337 and a broadcast/online audience of 57,000.  Many of those who filled in feedback forms had never or rarely attended art exhibitions or poetry readings \(of 39 local respondents to a Fitties event in 2016, 12 had never or rarely attended a poetry event; 9 stated they would if they felt such events were available/accessible, and 37 said they would attend a similar event in future\) \[ **E2**\]. Of the *Outfalls* weekend in 2018, the secretary of the LNT noted \[ **E4**\] that events ""attracted a wide range of people and of all ages who would not normally attend an art exhibition but who sat and gazed at a painting or read a poem about their favourite place and started reminiscing.” 

####  Developed the vitality of arts provision and activity 

 The Principal Arts Officer for NE Lincs \[ **E5**\] writes how the work “ *clearly convinced the powers that be that an Arts Development Team remains something NE Lincolnshire needs*.” A local curator acknowledges that both projects “ *influenced my approach to curating exhibitions and managing projects both in galleries and independent situations*.” She went on to feature place\-based works and poetry in programming at Abbey Walk Gallery, Grimsby \(2014\-16\) and Gallery Steel Rooms, Brigg 2017 \-2019 \[ **E6**\]. As a direct result of the research, the CIC inaugurated a an annual Fitties Festival, first held in 2019, 120 participants and the LNT commenced *Culture on the Canal*, an ongoing programme of events and exhibitions at the Louth Navigation Warehouse where a storeroom has been converted into a gallery as a direct result of *Outfalls* \[ **E4**\]. Their events regularly attract audiences of 60\+ to the canal’s banks.  Encounters with the research directly benefitted writers and artists from N.E. Lincs over 6 years of exhibitions, workshops and mentoring which inspired and developed the careers of twenty individuals \[ **E10**\]. 

####  Engaged audiences with interdisciplinary environmental artwork in the UK, China, Romania and Spain 

 Texts and images from *Project Fitties* and *Outfalls* have been selected for exhibition over 30 times. This showed how environmental artwork could bring originally site\-based community arts\-led research on local environmental issues to national and international attention. These exhibitions included local, accessible venues  mentioned above, to national galleries in London, Cambridge and Kings Lynn and, internationally at *The Sino\-British Biennale*, Yantai Art Museum, China, 2018  and *Beyond Other Horizons: Contemporary paintings made in Britain and Romania*, Iasi Palace of Culture, 2020. Poems were translated into Mandarin and Romanian for these exhibitions. A strong  relationship was formed with the curator of the Yantai Art Museum who  recognised the significance of the work:  stating  “ *What emerged was that despite our differences in locality there was much in common and that art and poetry can affect how we feel about landscape and place*.” \[ **E9**\] Artists' books  which were accessible and affordable for all were  shown at art fairs in Barcelona, London, South Yorkshire and Leeds. 

####  Influenced discourse and practice for writers and painters in UK and USA 

 The director of The Groundwork Gallery \[ **E7**\] notes “ *A number of artists said it gave them the courage to contemplate trying to combine visual art and writing.* …\[this\] *has opened up a whole new area of inspiration which has continued to develop and has been carried through to other gallery events*.” An American poet \[ **E8**\] writes of the impact of the research on her, “ *It has helped me think through the rich possibilities for place\-based artistic collaboration … my fifth book of poetry, Mississippi \(Wings Press 2018\), is a collaboration with the Delta photographer Maude Schuyler Clay*”. Tarlo and Tucker featured over sixty such collaborations \(many brought together specifically for these events\) into two public group exhibitions of interdisciplinary work: In the Open Cambridge 2015 \(New Hall Women’s Art collection\) and In the *Open Sheffield 2017* \(Sia Art Gallery; Bank Street Arts\).  Subsequently two exhibitions were curated in Sheffield and Devon in \(2018, 2019\) that “ *build on precedents set by Tarlo and Tucker*,” as the curator Camilla Nelson stated in her open call for “Radical Landscapes: Innovation in Language and Landscape Art” \(Torrington, Plough Gallery, Devon\) \[ **E6**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The research team from Buckinghamshire New University \(BNU\) originally validated novel non\-invasive technologies for cardiac output and cardiac power output measurements and then applied it to a group of patients with end\-stage heart failure. The continuing benefits since 2014 have shown how the original information was adopted for clinical applications both in the UK and abroad. Cardiac power output continues to be an important measure for people using left ventricular assist devices. The benefits of cardiac function testing are now being recognised in primary care.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research into cardiac power output \(CPO\) was co\-ordinated by Professor Brodie of BNU during the period 2004 to 2012. The team included Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, \(Heart Science Centre, Harefield Hospital\), Professor Emma Birks, \(currently Director, Heart Failure, Transplant and Mechanical Support Programme, University of Kentucky\), Dr Richard Grocott\-Mason \(Consultant Cardiologist, Hillingdon Hospital\), Dr Djordje Jakovljevic \(currently Professor and Research Lead, Cardiovascular and Exercise Sciences, Coventry University\) and a small group of PhD students. 

 The initial focus of the research was to explore the reliability and validity of CPO as an integral measure of both flow\- and pressure\-generating capacities of the heart. This involved a comparison of different rebreathing methods and resulted in the conclusion that inert gas rebreathing measured cardiac output more precisely than the alternative carbon dioxide rebreathing methods \(1\). As the target patient group was those with chronic heart failure, it was essential to explore the reproducibility of CPO in such groups and this was established with a low coefficient of variation \(2\). The outcome was a clear demonstration that CPO was an excellent prognostic marker and was subsequently strongly advised in the assessment of patients with chronic heart failure undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The process of cardiac rehabilitation can include both aerobic and resistance training and it was important to determine which was the most effective in improving cardiac function using CPO as the main determinant. Our work \(3\) demonstrated that aerobic exercise training increased the maximal flow\-generating capacity of the heart and delayed anaerobic metabolism in patients with stable chronic heart failure. 

 Much of our work was in association with the Magdi Yacoub Institute involving patients on the ‘Bridge to Recovery’ programme at Harefield Hospital. These patients were initially in end\-stage heart failure, awaiting heart transplantation, but as a result of the programme, involving the use of a left ventricular assist device \(LVAD\) many recovered sufficiently to avoid transplantation. Our findings demonstrated that CPO differentiates well during cardiac restoration using LVADs and can be used as marker of cardiac recovery \(4\). Another important contribution to the programme was our investigation into the impact of acute reduction of continuous\-flow LVAD support on cardiac and exercise performance. We showed for the first time that the LVAD can confer both resting and peak cardiac functional benefits to patients with end\-stage heart failure \(5\). We also showed that exercise\-derived prognostic indicators demonstrated a limited capacity in reflecting cardiac pumping capability in patients treated with LVADs \(6\). Thus the interpretation of cardiac organ function would benefit substantially by the inclusion of CPO.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The ideal non\-invasive measure of the heart’s pumping performance is cardiac power output \(CPO\). This continued case study demonstrates how other institutions, have adopted the validation of the use of CPO, nationally and internationally. Since 2014, there has been a recognition that it is necessary to measure both flow and pressure\-generating capacities of the heart to determine overall cardiac function meaningfully. One measure of the impact of a new procedure is the extent that it has been adopted outwith the original location of the research. 

 Cardiac power output has been adopted and its use sustained in a number of places since 2014. A good example of this is the adoption of CPO at the Translational and Clinical Research Institute at Newcastle University. A specialist laboratory has been established within this Institute and this laboratory now includes the measurement of CPO routinely. Professor Guy MacGowan’s work concentrates on heart failure and now uses CPO as part of his non\-invasive testing. His testimony states: 

  

 “*Cardiac power output \(CPO\), as a novel integrative measure of overall function and pumping capability of the heart, has been used at Freeman Hospital to assess eligibility of patients with advanced heart failure for heart transplantation and/or treatment with mechanical circulatory support. We also use CPO to follow\-up patients after the surgery, determine their prognosis and recovery*."" \(Professor MacGowan, Consultant Cardiologist, Newcastle Freeman Hospital, UK\) \[5.1\] 

 Non\-invasive cardiac output and CPO assessment is used to help clinicians identify the causes of exercise intolerance. The beneficiaries of the use of CPO include a number of clinical groups including those with cardiovascular \(n=421\), metabolic \(type 2 diabetes, liver disease, n=382\) and neurological disorders \(n=161\). Following our work, CPO is also now used by Dr Sandeep Hothi who states: 

 “*I recommend the use and wide adoption of cardiac power output measurement in clinical practice to evaluate patients with heart failure, improve risk stratification, assess the degree of cardiac dysfunction and guide decision making for pharmacological and non\-pharmacological interventions*."" \(Dr Hothi, Consultant Cardiologist, New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton\) \[5.2\]. 

 The numbers of patients involved in this work at New Cross Hospital is approximately 120 per annum. 

 The impact of our original work on CPO has seen the adoption of the procedure abroad. Its application follows the work we established at Harefield Hospital. It is part of the portfolio of procedures now available to patients following surgery at both the Aswan Heart Centre in Egypt and the Sidra Medical and Research Centre in Doha, Qatar. The Head of the Department of Cardiology in Aswan has stated: 

 ""*In the Aswan Heart Centre we use non\-invasive measures of cardiac output and cardiac power output in children and adults to help us define severity of cardiac dysfunction and inform decisions about the best treatment options for our heart failure patients*."" \(Dr ElGuindy, Head of Cardiology, Aswan Heart Centre, Egypt\) \[5.3\]. The numbers of patients involved in Aswan is approximately 160 per annum. 

 In the 2014 case study, we showed the importance of cardio\-respiratory fitness in people with chronic heart failure. A common precursor of heart failure is metabolic syndrome, yet little is known about the nature of its association with cardio\-respiratory fitness \(CRF\) across the age strata in the UK. The continuing impact of this work is predominantly in preventative health. 

 Public health messages are now advocating the need for an improvement in CRF alongside weight management for enhancing cardiometabolic health. This policy change is currently being driven by the private health sector such as Nuffield Health The NHS is progressively adopting a policy of including CRF assessments in UK health screening. It is now policy for all cardiac rehabilitation units, a decision made when Prof Brodie was Scientific Advisor to the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation. 

 Cardiac power output was one of the markers we used monitor the progress of patients with end\-stage heart failure. Alongside CPO, we used heart rate variability \(HRV\) to observe the patterns of cardiac autonomic nervous system \(ANS\) activity. The desired clinical endpoint for patients with a left ventricular assist device \(LVAD\) is to have it successfully explanted. Our 2014 study showed that implanted LVAD patients showed a partial normalisation of the HRV profile, with little difference between these patients and controls. The continuing impact of this work is that we now know that end\-stage heart failure patients, who are characterised by severe autonomic derangement, can show a high level of cardiac ANS normality following implantation of the LVAD. A more important impact is that this cardiac ANS normalisation appears to be maintained following explantation. The overall impact is that for the first time, we can be confident that such patients can return, with suitable pharmacological support, to live without their previous chronic end\-stage heart failure. 

 Since 2014, we are now able to show that in patients with advanced heart failure, awaiting transplantation, there was a significantly better cardiac performance and functional capacity among those in whom LVADs were explanted. A substantial proportion of these patients attained peak cardiac power output and peak oxygen consumption in the range of healthy individuals. A further impact is that we now know that prospective clinical trials are needed to define optimal pharmacological and physiological strategies to enhance myocardial recovery and allow for the use of LVADs as a bridge to recovery of cardiac function. One of our co\-workers at Harefield was Professor Emma Birks, who now works at the Gill Heart and Vascular Institute in Lexington, USA commented 

 ""*In our extensive heart transplant and mechanical circulatory support programme we use measurements of cardiac output and cardiac power output in evaluation and risk stratification of patients with advanced heart failure undergoing heart transplantation and ventricular assist device therapy*."" \(Professor Birks, Consultant Cardiologist and Director, Department of Cardiology, Gill Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA\) \[5.4\]. 

  

 The numbers of individuals worldwide, who have undertaken the LVAD procedure, is comparatively small. Yet individual case studies have shown that they exhibit improved cardiac function, the disease progression is slowed, further hospitalisation is decreased and the quality of their lives enriched. Our work on CPO has been a determining factor in measuring LVAD readiness and outcome. At the time of our original work in 2008, only one other centre \(Leeds Medical School\) used CPO. Since that time, and as a result of our publication profile, its adoption in the UK and worldwide has escalated.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘Nurturing Healthy Diversity’ used empirical research into inter\-religious dialogue and research in Church of England \(CofE\) schools in Birmingham to engage local schools in discussion about Religious Education \(RE\). The project resulted in impact on how involved schools approached RE, wider discussions in the Diocese through the publication of a booklet on diversity in church schools, and the development of an evaluation tool to help CofE schools address religious diversity for the SIAMs \(Statutory Inspection of Anglican and Methodist Schools\). The tool was used in one school, St Michael’s Bartley Green, resulting in changes to the school curriculum.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This project is underpinned by Stephen Pihlaja’s ongoing research on inter\-religious dialogue and Muslim citizenship in the UK. This work has looked specifically at how people of different faith and no faith understand one another and recognise shared values when they interact and the different strategies that are used in inter\-religious dialogue to find both highlight differences and find common ground \(see publications\). The research then moved to looking at inter\-religious dialogue in community settings in Birmingham. Between October 2018 and January 2019, Newman colleagues Dan Whisker \(Sociology\), Stephen Pihlaja, and Lisa Vickerage Goddard \(Education\) conducted a series of focus groups and one\-to\-one interviews with school leaders, teachers, governors, parents, and clerics. These interviews were conducted in four Church of England schools of the Birmingham diocese, chosen for their range of social and demographic characteristics. 

 In collaboration with the Birmingham Diocesan board for Education and supported by a grant from the St Peter’s Saltley Trust \(£2,238\), the team published a booklet for the Grove Education series as a practical resource for school leaders in building diverse communities. 

 In each school, the research discovered common ways of talking about community, where interviewees presented narratives around social diversity which simultaneously identified social tensions and presented the functional community of values as the mechanism of their resolution. In each case, though the poles of difference were themselves different \(along lines of social class and religious pluralism\), the resolving mechanism was presented, emically, as the effect of the shared values of all faiths: as the work of the divine through diverse human cultures. 

 The team analysed talk about community building on two levels: the level of socio\-linguistic construction of a space of shared values and the level of social practice, where shared values were embedded in individual identities through collective community action, especially worship and religious education. The team found that embedding these shared values was crucial for the successful day\-to\-day management of school life. The team also found that the accounts of these processes often revealed anxiety about incommensurable worldviews amongst participants, about the stability of the community being constructed and about the implications of this instability for the school and community. 

 Finally, the team identified successful examples of this community\-building work and sought to understand their efficacy in relation to the specific social, cultural, and economic circumstances of each school. The most successful examples responded to the specific forms of diversity in the school and its adjacent community. Grove books are intended to serve as guides to practice for members of the Anglican community, and the book stemming from this research presented the four schools as models for schools to plan their response to the challenges of different types of social and religious diversity in the school and surrounding community. As of January 2021, the book has sold 537 copies — mostly to schools and churches. The project also served as a pilot study for Dr Pihlaja’s successful AHRC ECR leadership fellowship proposal entitled ‘Language and Religion in the Superdiverse City’ \(£155,024 FEC\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research demonstrated that effective community building around shared values was a central part of the self\-identified ‘mission’ which socially and religiously diverse church schools. To explore how to translate specific instances of good practice from our findings into effective practice in the wider RE sector, the team hosted ‘town hall’ meetings in the schools where the research took place, with over thirty participants across the four schools. These meetings, in the Autumn of 2019, served to disseminate the findings of the research and to facilitate dialogue and planning for scalable approaches amongst community stakeholders. The project also began conversations begun within the schools about religious diversity among teachers, governors, and parents. The publication of the *Diversity and Success in Church Schools* booklet allowed schools to share their own good practices in a national context \(see support letters R1\-5\). 

 Feedback from school leaders and governors in these meetings suggested that SIAMS reports on inspections conducted using the new \(2019\) evaluation framework, derived from the Church of England’s ‘Vision for Education’ \(2016\) under reports were the most useful and objective metric of successful responses to challenges around social diversity. Consequently, the team began to liaise with other schools to do the following: 

 1\) Diagnose effective responses to requirements for ‘Diversity’ work in extant SIAMS reports 

 2\) Draw on the successful case studies identified in the research to provide models for successful community\-building projects. 

 3\) Connect schools with community groups in existing professional networks and facilitate dialogic planning and initiation of projects to respond to the needs identified in SIAMS reports. 

 This stage of the been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and the limits on staging public events in primary schools in the autumn of 2020. Despite these challenges, from October to December of 2020, the team worked with the leadership and RE lead of St Michael’s Church of England School in Bartley Green, and conducted a close analysis of their previous SIAMS reports and of the demographics and history of the area. 

 First, this analysis reviewed the school’s articulated vision and its theological underpinnings in relation to the social context of the school, helping the school to identify the kinds of outstanding practice which it most needs to, and can most effectively, pursue. 

 Second, it systematically worked through the grading criteria in the current SIAMS evaluation schedule and explored ways to map the existing outstanding practice in the school onto these, helping to maximise how effectively the SIAMS inspector will be able to recognise the ways in which the school is meeting the aims articulated in its vision. 

 Finally, it reviewed the previous SIAMS inspection for suggested points of improvement and identified ways for the school to respond to these. This identified points of practical action for the SIAMS lead, the school leadership, and the wider school community to take in maximising the school’s effectiveness in living out its Christian mission. 

 The review of the vision with school leadership impacted how the leadership subsequently addressed religious education and the school ethos more broadly \(R4\). In partnership with stakeholders, we designed a new curriculum resource for Key Stage \(KS\) 1/2 by working with LEAF Creative Arts and St Michael’s, to introduce the Paper Trails Project in St Michael’s, which is a structured curriculum element designed to help children across KS1 and KS2 to connect with elders from the surrounding community, in care homes and supported living, as part of their RE curriculum, through a pen\-pal system of writing letters and exchanging experiences and memories of different religious festivals. St Michael’s leadership reports that this has changed the school’s approach to the community and helped The SIAMS analysis and consequent genesis of the Paper Trails project have shaped the development of St Michael’s strategy for nurturing the school’s SMSC \(Social, Moral, Spiritual and Cultural development\), and has created impact in the development of the school’s thinking about Religious Education, their relationship with the community, and how to approach the SIAMs \(R5&7\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Scolnicov’s research argues that freedom of religion and belief \[FoRB\] should be interpreted and implemented as an individual right above any guarantee of a communal right. It had impact on: 

 \- International policy\-making \(within the UN and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights\). 

 \- A Supreme Court decision \(in Israel\) 

 \- Applications to Supreme Courts \(in Israel and the United Kingdom\). 

 \- Legislation \(in Ukraine and Ecuador\). 

 \- Policy\-making in NGOs. 

 The research also analyses the broader question whether human rights belong only to individuals or can also belong to non\-individuals \(including corporations and communities\). The finding that only individuals can have human rights had an impact on: 

 \- Submission to the Supreme Court of Canada. 

 \- Submission to the Inter\-American Court of Human Rights.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Anat Scolnicov is based in the Centre for Religion, Reconciliation and Peace and in the Law department at the University of Winchester. Her research identified the conflict between group and individual conceptions of religious freedom as a major tool for analysis and determination of religious freedom conflicts. The research offered a coherent framework for international law to interpret and guarantee the right to religious freedom by choosing to protect it as an individual right and not a collective right. Any right of a religious group or organisation is only derivative of individual rights, and therefore can never be paramount to them. This has implications for the rights of dissenters within religious groups \(3.1\), rights of women within and without the religious group, and rights of children in the family and in the religious community \(3.2\). 

 These insights have had specific implications for the rights of women, including the equal right to pray at holy sites, where women were excluded by leadership of religious communities \(of Muslims and Hindus in India, and Jews in Israel\) \(3.3\), and rights to reproductive health, where these were restricted based on prevailing views within religious communities. The research showed that women’s freedom of religion and belief can be in conflict with communal claims of religious freedom, often stemming from historic male\-domination of religious leadership positions \(3.3\). A coherent approach to interpreting this right as an individual right means that state law should protect the rights of women over communal claims of religious autonomy, and the right to religious freedom in international law should be interpreted as requiring states to which such international law applies to recognise these rights \(3.6\). 

 The writing on religious freedom is part of Scolnicov’s broader work on individual rights in conflict with claims of rights by communities and corporate bodies \(3.4\). This includes work in which she argues, based on both philosophical principles and public policy, that human rights are for individuals only and not corporate bodies \(3.5\). This includes, but is not limited to, religious bodies.

 <ins> **I\) Impact on</ins> <ins>Supreme C</ins><ins>ourt decisions and submissions to</ins> <ins>Supreme C</ins><ins>ourts</ins> <ins>and international</ins> <ins>courts**</ins> 

 1\) The research \(3.2, 3.3\), specifically the analysis of women’s reproductive choices as an exercise of individual freedom of religion and belief, influenced the arguments in an *amicus curiae* brief submitted to the UK Supreme Court by the UN WGDW as 2nd intervener in *In re Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission* \[2018\] UKSC 27 regarding the restrictive abortion law in Northern Ireland, prior to its recent reform \(5.1\). 

 2\) Scolnicov’s research \(3.2, 3.3\) impacted argument in applications for judicial review submitted to the Supreme Court of Israel, on behalf of Women of the Wall, demanding a right to equality in worship and ritual at the Western Wall. The applications used Scolnicov’s argument that a claim of a communal right of religious freedom \(of the Orthodox Jewish community\) cannot be used by the authorities of the Western Wall to infringe the individual religious freedom rights of Jewish women who wished to pray at the Western Wall in an equal manner to men. The Court accepted the women’s arguments \(5.1\). 

 3\) Scolnicov’s research was relied on by the Supreme Court of Israel in 2014 \( *Sabah v. The Knesset* \(5.10\), in one of the most important Israeli constitutional law cases of the decade, decided by a rare panel of 9 judges. The case concerned the question whether communal villages have a right to exclude individuals who are not members of the \(religious or other\) community, and determined that the community does not trump the rights of the individual, as is the position in her research. 

 4\) The research arguing against corporate human rights \(3.5\), was relied upon in an *amicus curiae* brief submitted to the Inter\-American Court of Human Rights, \(5.7\): “She \[Scolnicov – A.S.\] also points out that in certain cases the human rights of the individuals operating a legal person are expressed through a legal person and it is necessary to recognize such derivative rights in order to prevent future violations. She considers these cases as exceptions and therefore they do not give rise to a need to generalize and equalize the rights of natural individuals to those of a legal person” \(trans. from Spanish\). 

 This case resulted in an important precedent, in which the Inter\-American Court of Human Rights determined that the rights in the American Convention on Human Rights do not apply to corporate bodies, with the exception of indigenous groups and trade unions. The Court decision accepted the position in the amicus brief, which quoted Scolnicov’s work on this point. 

 Advisory Opinion OC\-22/1 of 26 Feb. 2016, requested by Panama,  [<ins>https://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/opiniones/seriea\_22\_esp.pdf</ins>](https://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/opiniones/seriea_22_esp.pdf) \(in Spanish\). 

 5\) The research arguing against recognition of corporate human rights \(3.5\) was relied upon in two *amicus curiae* brief submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada on 8.1.20, one by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association \(5.5\) the other by the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association \(5.6\), in File no. 38613 *Attorney General of Quebec, et al. v. 9147\-0732 Québec inc*., decided 5.11.20. This case ruled that corporate bodies do not have a right to compensation for pain and suffering under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

 The CCLA brief stated: “The CCLA submits that Charter rights are first and foremost the rights of human beings” and that any interpretation should focus “on the embodied human beings these rights are meant to protect”. 

 Citing Scolnicov’s work \(5.5 on p.5\), the CCLA said that “the lack of thorough and principled consideration of the significant implications of this important issue in the jurisprudence is not unique to Canada and international scholars observing that other courts, such as the European Court of Human Rights, have also simply assumed, without any principled discussion, that corporate entities may benefit from the protection of human right”. 

 While the facts of the case do not concern a religious organisation, the decision, which accepted her conceptual position on corporate rights, is relevant also to religious corporations. 

 **II\) <ins>Impact on international governance**</ins> 

 6\) Scolnicov’s research \(3.2, 3.3\) was part of the underpinning conceptual framework used by the UN Working Group on Discrimination Against Women \(WGDAW\) for the drafting of several policy documents and recommendations \(5.1\): 

 a\) The Chair of the UN WGDAW states in report A/HRC/26/3 that the UN WGDAW drew on the research in arguing for women's right to equality in the family, whether in theocratic regimes or plural legal systems \(5.1\). This accepted the conclusion of the research that religious communities \(in a plural legal regime\), or the state \(in a theocracy\), cannot claim religious freedom as a justification to infringe women’s individual rights of equality and religious freedom within the family. This recommendation was highly influential and was adopted by the Human Rights Council \(5.1\). 

 b\) Similarly, there was a joint policy position of the Special Rapporteurs of the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights against the Human Rights Council Resolution on Protection of the Family. The policy position opposed the Resolution of the HRC because it did not include a confirmation of women's right to equality in the family \(5.1\). 

 c\) The research influenced formulation of the position of the UN WGDAW on medical staff’s limited right to conscientious objection in the performance of legal abortions. The research influenced viewing a woman’s choice of abortion as an exercise of individual freedom of belief, against which doctors’ rights of religious freedom should be balanced \(5.1\). 

 7\) Insights from the research \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6\) were presented to a UN Expert Group meeting on Religious Minorities, convened by the UN Independent Expert on Minorities at the Office of the Commissioner on Human Rights in Geneva in 2013, leading to subsequent impact through the report of the Independent Expert on Minority Issues A/68/268 published by the UN GA on 5 August 2013 \(5.2\). 

 8\) The research \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\), including research which Scolnicov presented in an expert meeting on freedom of religion and belief and anti\-terrorism measures, convened in London in 2016 by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, had an influence on policy formation by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Expert Panel on Freedom of Religion and Belief \(5.2, 5.3\). 

 <ins> **III\)</ins> <ins>Impact on l</ins><ins>egislation**</ins>: 

 9\) In March 2016, MP Viktor Yelensky introduced in the Ukrainian Parliament registered draft law No.4128, which regulates the procedure of changing the affiliation with particular by religious communities \(5.9\). In introducing the bill in Parliament, MP Yelensky relied on Scolnicov’s work, arguing that recognition of religious freedom means that religious communities cannot coerce dissenting sub\-groups of community members to remain members of the community organisation, and the state should recognize their right to leave \(3.1, 3.3\). 

 10\) The Public Ombudsman of Ecuador published in 2017 a report on religious liberty in the secular state of Ecuador \(5.8\), analysing a draft Religious Equality and Liberty Bill. The report relied on Scolnicov’s research, accepting her conclusion that only individuals can have rights. The Ombudsman found this applicable to Ecuador, relying on her argument that if rights are extended to groups then the group could nullify rights of an individual within them, and preferring the interpretation of freedom of religion as a choice for each individual to make. 

 <ins> **IV</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>Influence on NGO policy</ins><ins>:**</ins> 

 11\) The insights published in \(3.2\) were presented at a consultation of the Canadian Council of Christian Charities, an umbrella organization of NGOs, in 2015 in Toronto. The CCCC invited several academics from a spectrum of opinions on religious freedom in private organizations to help the CCCC formulate their policy about the freedom of belief and freedom of expression of individuals within religious universities when in conflict with the religious autonomy of these institutions. A senior representative of the CCCC states that “Scolnicov’s presentation on religion in the public place assisted the CCCC in conceiving our policy on this issue” \(5.4\). 

 12\) Part of the research \(3.3\), showing that reservations to human rights treaties based on religion were predominantly excluding women from human rights protection, was presented in a meeting in 2014 of Universal Rights Group \(an international NGO headquartered in Geneva\) to diplomats assigned to the UN in Geneva, from States which entered such reservations, including heads of missions from Ireland, Algeria, Morocco, Jordan, Tunis, and the Holy See, and senior officials from the UN Human Rights Commission\). \(5.3\). 

 V\) <ins> **Impact through public outreach**</ins>: 

 13\) The research contributed to public discussion through engagement with the public, including in an inaugural public lecture in Winchester \(3.3\), and additional public seminars at the Winchester Centre for Religion, Reconciliation and Peace, including a seminar on refugees and religious freedom.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Southampton \(UoS\) research into the development and optimisation of a new generation of highly efficient, smart High\-Power Fibre Lasers \(HPFLs\) is directly responsible for the significant growth and commercial success over the impact period of SPI Lasers Ltd, a UK company originally spun out of UoS and now among the world’s leading HPFL manufacturers. Over the seven\-year period, SPI has generated cumulative revenues of GBP436m and cumulative gross profits of GBP109.8m; annual revenues increased from GBP35.3m at the beginning of the census period to a peak of GBP78.7m and annual gross profits rose from GBP7.6m to a peak of GBP23.0m. The company has supported up to 303 jobs and created 47 new roles. SPI’s laser product ranges have benefitted companies across multiple industries, including the aerospace, automotive, energy and medical sectors, in 130 countries. Impact ‘downstream’ can be seen in substantial energy savings and emission reductions arising from the lasers’ efficiency gains, and improving the capabilities of SPI customers in addressing key societal challenges, including the manufacture of lightweight aircraft parts, batteries and fuel cells, and life\-enhancing medical devices such as pacemakers and synthetic bones.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Fibre lasers, in which the active medium being used is an optical fibre doped in rare\-earth elements, are one of the most recent entrants into the highly competitive laser market. Their strengths lie in their inherent stability, beam quality, compact size and their ability to achieve very high levels of power much more efficiently than conventional lasers. Use of fibre lasers across multiple industries including the automotive, medical, consumer electronics, materials processing and manufacturing sectors has increased rapidly in recent years, with Cambridge\-based technology market research specialists IDTechEx forecasting global sales of GBP8.9bn by 2028. 

 Extensive research spanning two decades within the Optoelectronics Research Centre \(ORC\) has pioneered the development and optimisation of commercially viable HPFL technologies. In the early 2000s, the Group developed optical fibres and laser concepts that allowed scaling in average output powers and extended the range of operating modes to include both short\-pulse and high\-power, single\-frequency operations. Practical all\-fibre techniques were developed to couple the required pumping light derived from laser diodes into the fibre laser structure in a scalable, robust and compact fashion. This patented technology was critical for the development of UoS spinout company SPI Lasers Ltd \(SPI\). In 2004, ORC researchers conducted the world's first demonstration of a fibre laser \(FL\) system that could emit powers of greater than 1 kW, convincingly showing for the first time that fibre lasers could compete favourably with existing laser technologies \[ **3.1**\]. A year later SPI was successfully floated on the Alternative Investment Market. Further work led to the development of a high\-performance, single\-frequency system that greatly extended the functionality and ultimate power scaling of fibre lasers \[ **3.2**\]. 

 SPI Lasers, now TRUMPF Lasers UK Ltd, funded the establishment of the ORC/SPI Advanced Laser Lab \(ALL\) at UoS in 2011 \[ **G1**\] to fully optimise the fibre laser technologies. Subsequent collaborative research, led by Professor Michalis Zervas, who in 2016 was awarded a SPI Lasers/Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair, has enabled the development of a new generation of smart HPFLs for advanced manufacturing that significantly outperform competing technologies. HPFLs now offer record wall\-plug efficiencies \(>35%\), power scalability \(10s of kW with near\-perfect beam quality & 100s of kW of process\-tailored beams\), extended wavelength coverage \(UV\-to\-green\-to\-mid\-IR\), beam delivery with unprecedented temporal and spatial control, as well as advanced process monitoring capabilities. Key research advances and technological ‘firsts’ that derived from ALL are summarised below; this research was transferred to SPI’s IP portfolio and adopted into the company’s production processes. It resulted in 8 patent filings, with the research publication following at a later date. 

 **2.1 HPFL efficiency, stability and power scalability:** Critical to the development of robust HPFLs for industrial use is the mechanically strong and low\-loss fusion splicing of dissimilar fibres \[ **P1**\]. The Group developed advanced fibre splicing techniques, resulting in an increase in optical\-to\-optical conversion efficiency from \~65% to >85%. It identified the power\-scaling limitations in HPFLs and defined the fibre and pumping technologies required to maximise the power of individual single\-mode FLs, which exceed current state\-of\-the\-art performance by a factor of four to five \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\]. 

 **2.2 Variable beam\-shape output:** The Group developed novel all\-fibre techniques for dynamic output beam shape control, which involve mechanically adjustable in\-fibre devices in standard power delivery fibres, enabling high\-quality cutting of thin and thick mild\-steel sheets at higher speeds \[ **3.5, P2**\]. This has resulted in >20% faster 10\-15mm mild steel cutting than multimode \(MM\) beams with same power and beam quality \(M<sup>2</sup>\).  It also succeeds in 20mm mild steel high quality cutting, which is not possible with same power MM beams. 

 **2.3 Non\-destructive preform characterisation:** The Group developed a novel non\-destructive optical technique for the rare\-earth\-doped optical fibre preform inspection. The technique can map the spatial distribution of ytterbium ions within the core, along the entire length of the preform \[ **3.6**\], thus enabling the most appropriate and in\-spec parts to be drawn into fibres. This increases the drawn fibre yield by 50\-60% and shortens the fibre and laser production cycles by 20\-30%, significantly reducing final product cost and increasing reliability. 

 **2.4 CO<sub>2</sub> laser milling:** A novel CO<sub>2</sub> laser milling technique for precise preform outer\-surface preparation for optimum pump mode mixing was developed, which resulted in \~40% shorter, more compact, stable and energy efficient fibre lasers \[ **3.7**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 ORC research into the development of a new generation of highly efficient, smart HPFLs is directly responsible for the significant growth and commercial success over the impact period of SPI Lasers Ltd. The processing applications offered by SPI’s HPFL technology platform have directly benefitted the company’s customers across a broad range of industry sectors in 130 countries; welding, cutting, marking and micro\-machining operations can be carried out faster and more accurately for better reliability, less waste and higher productivity. 

 **Commercial benefits to SPI Lasers Ltd – and the wider economic impact** 

 Early ORC research \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] formed the foundation of the fibre laser technology platform that SPI exclusively licenses from UoS. This platform underpins all of SPI’s lasers, comprising two product ranges that are unique to the market: redENERGY® Pulsed Fibre Lasers and redPOWER® CW Fibre Lasers \[ **5.1**\]. The former constitutes 20W\-250W nanosecond pulsed fibre lasers, which offer flexibility and speed for laser marking and pulsed micro\-machining; the latter is a range of continuous wave \(CW\) lasers that provide high levels of power and control while cutting, welding and drilling. Fundamental research within ALL to optimise the performance of HPFLs has developed in parallel with new market opportunities identified by SPI, facilitating rapid adoption of the underpinning science and technology by SPI’s R&D team \[ **5.1**\]. 

 This research output has resulted in a number of key technological breakthroughs that have further enhanced the SPI product portfolio throughout the impact period and added unique selling points to existing products. These include \[ **5.1**\]: 

 • GTWave<sup>TM</sup> pumping technology: unique cladding pumping technology, separating and “isolating” pump and signal paths and resulting in increased pump and fibre laser lifetime. 

 • Photo\-darkening free active fibres without laser output power decay: increases pump and fibre laser lifetime. 

 • Pulse\-shaping using semi\-conductor seed laser\-based nanosecond pulsed MOPA lasers, enabling a very broad operating range of pulse widths and pulse shapes, providing customers with class\-leading results. 

 • Pulsed laser seed Stimulated Brillouin Scattering mitigating technique: extends operation parameter space of pulsed lasers and ensuring very high reliability for large\-scale deployments. 

 • In\-fibre beam shaping technology: variMODE<sup>TM</sup> beam shaper, enabling high\-quality cutting of thin and thick mild\-steel sheets with lower power at higher speeds. 

 8 patents have been filed by the ORC during this period and licensed to SPI. This includes the research breakthroughs described in **2.1\-2.3** \[ **3.3**\- **3.6**\], which were transferred to SPI under exclusive licenses in the period 2014 to 2018 \[ **5.1**\]. The optical\-to\-optical conversion efficiency increases, secured through **2.1, 2.3** and **2.4** \[ **3.3**, **3.4**, **3.6** and **3.7**\], has allowed use of lower\-cost, lower\-brightness pump laser sources and resulted in a cumulative \~28% reduction in required pump power in the period 2014 to 2018. Introduced to the HPFL manufacturing process, this resulted in a \~75% cost saving of pumping for SPI, which in monetary terms equates to GBP7500/kW and will equate to GBP5\-10m saving in 2020 \[ **5.1**\]. The increased levels of efficiency have resulted in substantially lower heating of the fibre and other critical components, facilitating power scaling of single laser units in excess of 2kW in 2018  from 0.5kW in 2013, and beam combined multi\-kW laser sources to 20kW in 2018 from 3kW in 2013 \[ **5.1**\]. 

 The new fully automated splicing techniques introduced in SPI’s production line, enabled by research described in **2.1** and **P1**, along with high\-yield special fibres enabled through **2.3** \( **3.6\)**, resulted in a new range of 50W\-300W high\-power pulsed lasers of which SPI has shipped more than 10,000 units. These have enabled new micro\-processing applications in consumer electronics manufacturing, battery cell manufacturing and solar cell manufacturing \[ **5.1**\]. These new applications allowed SPI to transition from best\-in\-class laser marking to best\-in\-class pulsed welding and cutting from 2014 onwards \[ **5.1**\]. The innovations in **2.1\-2.4** \( **3.3**\- **3.7**\) also led to a new production line of low cost, multi\-kW fibre lasers for materials processing, targeting the extremely price\-sensitive East Asia market, with a dedicated applications and sales centre established in Shenzhen, China in 2016. SPI expanded its main UK manufacturing facility in the Southampton area by nearly double in 2018 \[ **5.2**\]. The technological breakthrough in **2.2** \( **3.5, P2**\) was transferred exclusively to SPI and formed a new range of HPFLs under the variMODE<sup>TM</sup> trademark, launched at the Laser World of Photonics show in Munich in 2019 \[ **5.3**\]. 

 Confirming the direct relationship between UoS research and the growth and commercial success of SPI as a whole over the impact period, SPI CEO’s said: “ *University of Southampton research, both in the early to mid\-2000s and since the establishment of our collaborative Advanced Laser Lab at the University in 2011, has been fundamental to the significant revenue and profit growth that the company has achieved between 2013 and 2020; without these technological breakthroughs this level of growth and commercial performance simply would not have been possible”* \[ **5.1**\] *.* As a result, there is a direct link between ORC research and the following indicators of commercial and wider economic impact. SPI’s cumulative revenues over the impact period were GBP436,000,000; annual revenues increased from GBP35,300,000 in 2013 \(as of June 30 \- the closest available records to the beginning of the impact period\) to a peak of GBP78,700,000 in 2018. Its gross profits totalled GBP109,800,000; annual profits increased from GBP7,600,000 in 2013 to a peak of GBP23,500,000 in 2018 \[ **5.4**\]. As of 2019, the company supports 303 jobs across its facilities in Southampton and Rugby, 36% of which are ‘high\-skilled’. In June 2013, 256 people were employed by the company, meaning 47 new jobs were created over the impact period \[ **5.4**\]. SPI has directly invested GBP1,787,000 in UoS research within ALL over the impact period \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **‘Downstream’ commercial benefits to SPI Ltd.’s customers, and the wider societal impact** 

 SPI’s customers span 130 countries and multiple industries including the aerospace, automotive, electronics health, sensor, energy and jewellery sectors. SPI’s CEO summarises the overarching benefit to the company’s customers as ‘ *having a volume\-deployable laser technology that is cost\-effective and operates repeatably and reliably, replacing traditional cutting and joining methods*’ \[ **5.1**\]. In addition to substantially improving the quality, reliability and productivity of established processes, SPI’s new generation of smart lasers require less total energy through allowing laser power to be correctly and efficiently deployed. This has resulted in a \~28% reduction in electricity running costs for the company’s customers, which equates to a monetary annual saving of GBP1,400 for a 4kW laser UK user \(based on average UK industrial electricity tariffs\) \[ **5.1**\]. SPI can achieve similar cut speed and quality with a smart 2kW fibre laser as can be achieved with a conventional 4kW fibre laser. In this case the electricity bill savings increase to GBP3,000. Similar gains are achieved in additive manufacturing, welding, ablation and micro\-hole drilling, which when combined they result in a total reduction in running costs of 50% for the company’s customers, equating to an annular saving of GBP2,000 over other laser technologies \[ **5.1**\]. 

 A series of case studies on SPI’s website provides an overview of how their smart HPFLs are deployed by their customers \[ **5.5**\]. For example, in the aerospace sector SPI’s lasers are used in laser metal deposition to repair aeroplane engine blades, in additive manufacturing to produce lighter aircraft parts and in laser engraving of aerospace parts. In the automotive sector they are deployed to enhance the precision and efficiency of battery production for electric vehicles. In the health sector they are used to coat dental implants, to 3D\-print teeth and spinal implants, and in the welding of medical devices. They are used in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells and in bespoke jewellery design. SPI pulsed and continuous wave smart fibre lasers offer technological advantages, including wavelength agility as well as extended stability and reliability, in applications such as print roll engraving \[ **5.6**\]. Pulsed nanosecond fibre lasers have been used for marking and micromachining an extensive range of materials, uniquely offering pulse duration selection to enable a broad range of processes to be performed with a single laser, wide pulse frequency range allowing the selection of the optimum combination of average power, peak power and pulse energy, a variety of spatial profiles to further optimise the process and advanced control to allow sophisticated integration into processes and systems \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Environmental benefits** 

 The increase in laser efficiency through the optimisation of the HPFL technology has minimised electrical power consumption and increased manufacturing speed and quality. The overall SPI laser wall\-plug efficiency has increased from \~25% to \~35% over the impact period. This equates to a 28% reduction in electricity requirements \[ **5.1**\], which in the case of SPI’s heavy\-duty industrial lasers translates into a reduction of 10,500\-17,000 tonnes per year of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The lower limit is based on UK government greenhouse gas reporting conversion factors \(0.37kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh \[ **5.8**\]\), averaged over the case study period. The upper limit reflects fibre laser world\-wide usage in countries with higher conversion factors \(0.6kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prescribed drug dependency and/or withdrawal affects over 4 million antidepressant and benzodiazepine users in the UK today. No dedicated NHS services exist to help patients who have been substantially affected, while national clinical guidelines have significantly underestimated the extent to which antidepressant withdrawal can be protracted and severe. Research initiated and led by Dr James Davies has shaped the work of the Council for Evidence\-based Psychiatry and the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Prescribed Drug Dependence, resulting in **the first major UK government review of prescribed drug dependence and withdrawal** and a **government commitment to a national** **withdrawal and dependency helpline**, **pledged by the Secretary of State for Health** in 2019. Subsequently, in 2019, the **UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence changed its clinical guidelines on antidepressant withdrawal**, based on Davies’ research findings. Extensive media coverage of Davies’ research has also shaped public debate and understanding of these issues. These health policy changes will improve the lives of up to 1.3 million patients in the UK, who will now be eligible for withdrawal support, while contributing to a significant reduction in the £400 million annual cost to NHS England from unnecessary prescription and consultation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Mental health issues affect around 1 in 4 people in the UK each year, with 1 in 6 seeking professional help. Since the recent expansion of psycho\-pharmaceutical interventions in the late 1990s, treatment of depression and related mental health issues in the UK has chiefly focused on prescription drugs such as SRRIs, antidepressants and anxiolytics \(e.g. benzodiazepines\), with nearly 20% of the UK adult population being prescribed these drugs in 2019. Since 2011, Davies has led research into withdrawal and dependency associated with each class of drug, playing a fundamental role in changing clinical guidelines and the national response to prescribed drug dependence. 

 In 2012, Davies’ book, The Importance of Suffering: The Value and Meaning of Emotional Discontent \( **R1**\) questioned the dominance of the medical model in mental health provision. Key research findings included that the medical model, supported by the pharmaceutical industry has crowded out effective psycho/social provision in the NHS \( **R2**\), and that the linchpin of the medical model \- the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \- has over\-medicalised social suffering \( **R3**\). Davies’ research argued that professional, cultural and industrial interests have shaped research, practice and regulation throughout the mental health sector, leading to over\-medicalisation and the over\-prescribing of psycho\-pharmaceuticals. These issues were further explored in The Sedated Society \( **R4**\), a volume edited by Davies, with chapters authored by psychiatrists, psycho\-pharmacologists and anthropologists, exploring the socio\-cultural determinants of rising and long\-term psycho\-pharmaceutical prescribing. 

 This qualitative work led Davies and Dr Todd Rae to quantify any harms emerging from over\-prescribing, resulting in a study published in the *British Journal of General Practice* \( **R5**\), which provided the first estimate of the number of long\-term benzodiazepine users in England. It showed that approximately 300,000 such users have been taking benzodiazepines for at least one year, even though the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) \(2009\) guidelines stipulate usage should never exceed four weeks. This study revealed the scale of prescribed benzodiazepine dependency in England. It called for support services \(including a 24\-hour helpline\) and better clinical guidelines to address the problem. 

 Davies, with Prof John Read \(University of East London\), also undertook a comprehensive systematic review into the incidence, duration and severity of antidepressant withdrawal \( **R6**\). The systematic review concluded that the withdrawal reactions when stopping antidepressants are, on average, far more severe, protracted and common than existing UK \(NICE 2009\) and US \(APA 2019\) national clinical guidelines acknowledge. For example, for two decades the NICE guidelines have stipulated that antidepressant withdrawal is ‘usually mild, self\-limiting, resolving over about one week’. In contrast, the Davies and Read systematic review showed that at least half of all antidepressant users experience withdrawal, that around half of these report that withdrawal as severe, and a significant proportion experience withdrawal for far longer than one week – in some cases many months. 

 The study concluded that such inaccurate guidelines were leading many doctors to misdiagnose withdrawal as ‘relapse’ \(the original problem returning\) with drugs being wrongly reinstated. This can partly explain why the average duration of time a person spends on an antidepressant has doubled since the guidelines were first issued in 2004, accounting for rising long\-term use and prescriptions overall \(4.4 million people in England have been taking antidepressants for at least two years\). The Davies and Read systematic review therefore recommended that NICE must revise its national guidelines to better recognise withdrawal, to support patients in withdrawal and to prevent doctors from wrongly attributing withdrawal to relapse \(changes that would also significantly lower prescribing rates\).

1.  **Shaping health policy in the UK: informing Public Health England review and government recommendations** 

 In 2013, Davies presented his research on mental health in the UK Parliament \( **R1**, **R2**\). Following concerns raised by parliamentarians after the sharing of his findings, Davies contributed to the founding of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Prescribed Drug Dependence \(APPG\-PDD\) in 2015, then Chaired by Sir Oliver Letwin MP & Norman Lamb MP. The purpose of the APPG is to liaise with policy makers and government to improve recognition of, and provision for, UK patients harmed by prescribed drug dependency and withdrawal. 

 In recognition of his research, Davies was appointed as the APPG’s Head of Research, and since 2015 has co\-led its secretariat. His research was fundamental to the founding of the APPG, and has also been pivotal in informing the subsequent actions of the APPG by enabling the group to lobby the government using evidence\-based findings to provide support and services for UK patients suffering adverse effects from prescribed drug dependency and withdrawal \( **IMP1**, **IMP2**\). 

 In 2015, the APPG wrote and submitted a report, that was co\-edited by Davies and drew on his research, to the British Medical Association \(BMA\) calling for a review of prescribed drug dependency and withdrawal in the UK. Specifically, the report drew on Davies’ research findings regarding the extent of prescribed drug dependency in England \( **R2**\) to justify the call for support for those suffering dependency and withdrawal. After a series of round\-table meetings, the BMA adopted the APPG’s call for a national prescription drug helpline on October 24th 2016 to tackle prescribed drug dependence in the UK. 

 During these meetings it became clear that the Department of Health would not fund such services \(and helpline\) in the absence of up\-to\-date, evidence\-based estimates regarding the number of long\-term users \(e.g. of benzodiazepines\) in England. In direct response, Davies undertook research into the likely number of such users, publishing his findings in 2017 \( **R5**\) on the advice of Prof Parveen Kumar \(Chair of the BMA’s Board of Science\). The research was widely covered in the media \(e.g. BBC Radio 5 Live, *BBC News, The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Daily Mail*\), with a combined potential audience of 3,132,948 reached via print media; 812,381,768 impressions through online media, with 908 public comments; 5,713,000 reached via radio, and 5,276,000 reached via television \( **IMP3**\). This extensive coverage substantially raised the pressure on public health officials at the Department of Health to address the problem. As the APPG Co\-Chair states: ‘Davies’ research has significantly raised the policy profile of prescribed drugs harms in the UK, bringing essential awareness and coverage to issues that affect millions of people in Britain and beyond’ \( **IMP1**\). 

 In March 2017, the APPG met in Parliament with representatives from Public Health England \(PHE\) and the BMA to discuss background work on overprescribing \( **R4**\), to share Davies’ research findings \( **R5**\) and to present new data on the costs of unnecessary long\-term prescribing in England \(for benzodiazepines £15.2m per year; for antidepressants £44m per year\). The principal outcome of this meeting was an agreement that the research should be presented to Duncan Selbie, Chief Executive of PHE. Representatives from the APPG met with Selbie in September 2017, where they presented the research findings and costings data. This led to Selbie’s agreement that a PHE review on prescribed drug dependence was warranted. The review was formally ratified two weeks later by the then Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt MP. The PHE review into prescribed drug dependency took two years to complete. Davies was appointed to its Expert Advisory Panel and contributed to the PHE Rapid Evidence Assessment, helping determine the review’s scope, the design of its data reviews and systematic analyses, as well as the suitability and outcomes of existing service models. The final PHE report, Dependence and withdrawal associated with some prescribed medicines: an evidence review, was published in September 2019 \( **IMP4**\); its policy recommendations to government were directly based on those called for in Davies’ research \( **R5**\), including: 

-  A 24\-hour national helpline and associated website to provide advice and support for those adversely affected by prescribed drug dependency and withdrawal; 

-  Updated clinical guidance and improved doctor training; 

-  Further research into the nature and severity of withdrawal and its successful treatment; 

-  Appropriate support from the NHS for patients, including dedicated support services. 

 As the Chair of the APPG states: ‘Dr Davies’ research findings into long\-term benzodiazepine use, and the substantial media reporting that followed, played a seminal role in raising the public profile of prescribed drug dependency in the UK and convincing public health officials at PHE to undertake a government review into prescribed drug dependency.’ \( **IMP2**\). His comments are echoed by the Co\-Chair of the APPG: ‘Dr Davies’ research findings regarding the number of long\-term benzodiazepine users in England \(as well as regarding the NHS costs incurred by unnecessary long\-term prescribing of antidepressants and benzodiazepines\) were crucial in launching the Public Health England review into prescribed drug dependency. \[…\] Without the research undertaken by Davies and colleagues this review and its recommendations would not have materialised’ \( **IMP1**\). Following publication of the review, in November 2019 the current Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock MP, publicly announced plans to fund a prescribed drug national helpline, including for antidepressant and benzodiazepine dependency and withdrawal \( **IMP5**\). In October 2020, NHS England and NHS Improvement established a prescribed medicines oversight group. This group will work closely with the APPG to oversee implementation of the NHS recommendations from the PHE review, including the aim to establish a national helpline, and to implement these recommendations by 2021/2022. 

1.  **Changes to national guidelines: national clinical guidelines \(NICE\) and Royal College of Psychiatrists’ official position** 

 During the PHE review, it became clear that there was a significant disparity between what the NICE guidelines stated about antidepressant withdrawal and what a large percentage of patients and grassroots organisations were reporting. To test the accuracy of NICE’s statement that antidepressant withdrawal was invariably mild ‘resolving over about one week’, Davies undertook a comprehensive systematic review of antidepressant withdrawal \( **R6**\). This evidenced that national clinical guidelines \(NICE\) significantly underestimated the severity, duration and incidence of antidepressant withdrawal, leading to increasing long\-term use and rising antidepressant prescriptions overall. Recommendations from the research called for UK national guidelines to be urgently updated to safeguard doctors against wrongly attributing withdrawal to relapse \(leading to lengthening use, rising prescriptions and additional harms\). 

 This research was sent by the APPG to NICE in October 2018. Substantial media coverage of this review \(e.g. most UK newspapers, Sky News; BBC Radio 5 Live; BBC Radio 4’s *All in the Mind*; **IMP3**\) and the significant academic debate that ensued, provided prescribed antidepressant and benzodiazepine users with a voice and increased public and professional support for changes to be made to the guidelines. As the APPG Chair stated in *The Guardian* \(2<sup>nd</sup> October 2018\): ‘This systematic review provides important new data on antidepressant withdrawal… suggesting that existing medical guidelines in this area should be urgently updated to reflect the fact that antidepressant withdrawal is much more common, severe and long\-lasting than previously stated. Furthermore, we hope that other medical bodies will take note of this new research, and update their own guidance accordingly.’ \( **IMP3**\). Following the systematic review and the significant public debate that followed, NICE, after appraising the research \( **IMP6**\), changed its clinical guidelines in October 2019 \( **IMP7**, **IMP8**\), bringing them in line with Davies' research conclusions \( **R6**\), to assert that antidepressant withdrawal can be protracted and severe: 

 ‘Explain that whilst the withdrawal symptoms which arise when stopping or reducing antidepressants can be mild and self\-limiting, there is substantial variation in people's experience, with symptoms lasting much longer \(sometimes months or more\) and being more severe for some patients.’ \( **IMP8**\) 

 Alongside this work with NICE, the APPG also shared the systematic review findings \( **R6**\) with the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists \(RCPsych\) in November 2018, recommending that the RCPsych change its official position on antidepressant withdrawal to bring it in line with the systematic review’s findings and the agreed changes to the NICE guidelines. RCPsych formally changed its position on antidepressant withdrawal via publication of a new ‘position statement’ in May 2019 \( **IMP9**\). 

 Both the PHE and NICE initiatives affect millions of people in England alone; 7.4 million adults in England were prescribed antidepressants in 2019 \(with over half taking antidepressants long\-term\). Approximately 300,000 people are long\-term users of benzodiazepines, and therefore dependent. The relevant withdrawal support, once established, will span face\-to\-face and helpline provision, and assist up to 1.3 million eligible patients in the UK. As well as the profound human cost of over\-prescribing, the financial cost to the NHS runs into approximately £400 million annually as a result of unnecessary prescription and consultation costs. As the APPG Chair states: ‘By addressing such over\-prescribing as well as revising NICE guidelines we are likely to save the government substantial sums in the coming years via mitigating the costs incurred by unnecessary long\-term use’ \( **IMP2**\). He concludes: ‘Dr Davies’ contribution to achieving a reduction in prescription drug dependence through a change in policy and practice, underpinned by his research findings, is a substantial achievement and a great service for those affected by prescribed drug dependency across the UK.’ 

 Davies continues to investigate the scale of the financial costs of over\-prescribing practices to the NHS in the UK. Through his ongoing contribution to the APPG, he aims to ensure his resultant research findings will inform and influence future assessments of service provisions within the NHS while also informing national de\-prescribing and social\-prescribing initiatives currently being developed in the NHS.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Flooding and pollution are increasing worldwide. Urbanisation and climate change are producing insecure, degraded ecosystems. Coventry University \(CU\) has pioneered research in Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) that has revolutionised the way infrastructure and ecology can combine. Our work has discovered new ways to deactivate pollution, enhanced ecology and assisted world\-famous sporting icons. Our research has guided sector expertise for practitioners draining catchments, resulting in landscape transformation. Informed by CU work, over 100 km<sup>2</sup> of permeable paving \(PP\) has been installed in the UK alone, since conception. Marshalls paving, for example, have applied CU’s contribution to SuDS development globally, installing 5 million m<sup>2</sup> of PP since 2014. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 SuDS research at CU has aimed to discover and improve measures that facilitate rainfall soaking into the ground, rather than running off and generating flooding. Once the water is below ground, work has investigated ways to remove pollutants, deactivating toxins in\-situ by microbiological processes. The innovative nature of the research has led to numerous collaborations with partners including the EU, Highways England, charities and SMEs. In 2003, CU researchers were first to identify the importance of biology in engineered SuDS, which could improve pollution prevention properties in engineered permeable pavement \(PP\) \(R1\). Research in this area, focussed on microbiological remediation of pollution in stormwater, contaminated from urban and industrial runoff, continues to the present day \(R5\). 

 In a KTP beginning in 2004 \(G1\), Coupe was the first to investigate the impact of herbicides on PP and from 2012\-15, work on herbicides in SuDS was advanced by Mbanaso, Charlesworth and Coupe, working with Interpave, a major UK paving and landscaping trade body. Research demonstrated that herbicides brought considerable environmental risk to SuDS; researchers documented methodologies for \(and tested the feasibility of\) deactivating the much\-used herbicide Roundup, within these systems \(R2\). 

 CU research also established that pollution in water and gases can be remediated by SuDS. From 2011\-2014, Newman, Coupe and Mbanaso investigated the potential application of SuDS for landfill gas remediation, working with the company SEL Environmental. Landfill produces methane, a greenhouse gas, from waste disposal. Research assessed how SuDS could be used to soak up harmful gases, to vent explosive gases away from nearby buildings. Coupe and Newman showed how this technology could combine with stormwater recovery to both reduce flood risk and provide treatment sites for removing urban contaminants \(R3\). 

 From 2014\-16 Marshalls sponsored a £100,000 programme of research \(G2\), led by Coupe and Sañudo Fontaneda, to examine the benefits of new PP designs and new paradigms on water quality, whilst supporting risk analysis on disposal of SuDS after use \(R4\). Pollution receptors inside SuDS are not inert, but strongly biologically active, with microbial communities that remove biodegradable material and toxic non\-biodegradable metals by biological interaction. This work is being continued in the CU contribution to a 30 partner, 15 university, €3.8m Marie Curie ITN project led by Coupe, named SAFERUP\! \(R5\). 

 Since 2017, field\-scale green infrastructure devices were tested onsite at CU by Sañudo Fontaneda, Lashford and Coupe \(2020\), with research on swales \(R6\) and green roofs. Green roof work was led by Coupe and Trenchard in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(G3\), proving the potential for green roofs to enhance insect and plant biodiversity \(2017\-2019\). 68 plant species were established on a retrofitted green roof incorporating the SEL/Permavoid blue green roof design beneath, replicating a wildflower meadow. Beneficial ecological function is shown in SuDS microbiological action, including bioremediation and in our new blue and green roof designs that demonstrably facilitate biodiversity. Discovery and elucidation of beneficial biological action in engineered stormwater infrastructure, is unique to CU SuDS, explaining the novelty of our work and enthusiasm of funders to collaborate.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CU researchers have worked extensively with industry to bring new knowledge to SuDS, enabling the effective integration of these techniques into drainage designs. Introducing paving surface permeability and plants to SuDs, has resulted in tangible impacts on companies working with CU; this has been both in terms of product development and compliance, benefiting the downstream environments \(please see the chart below for a summary of impact flow\). 



 A major project has been the development of permeable pavement, an innovative drainage solution, which CU was involved in from the earliest stages. The journey began through the creation of a joint patent with the company Formpave in 2000, the first move to establish PP in a way that replaced traditional, often inadequate pipe and gully drainage. The UK Committee on Climate Change stated that during 2009\-13, “an estimated 5,100,000m<sup>2</sup> \(510 ha\) of permeable paving was installed in England” \- 8% of the total area of block paving \(S1, p.1\).  The market has grown since then, led by Marshalls, the UK’s largest SuDs installer; since 2014 they have generated a profit of £14 million based on turnover of £2.5 billion, of which £500 million is in permeable paving \(S3\).  They alone were responsible for installation of 5,000,000 m<sup>2</sup> of PP during 2014\-2020, which has led to around 1,500,000 m<sup>3</sup> of stormwater being diverted from the UK’s overloaded and flood prone sewer network. Marshalls observed the success of improving water quality in their offer, changing their design to include filtering geotextiles, after research at CU \(S2\). Explaining the impact of CU research in 2020, Marshalls head of SuDS said: “we lead the market because of this relationship with Coventry University…the collaboration with CU helps us in staying at the front of the sector. Coventry University is the only institution that we have active research with” \(S3, S10\). 

 CU and SEL Environmental have collaborated since 2000. CU research rigorously tested the properties of the Permavoid module, a key water storage element, found in all SEL designs since its initial development. SEL’s managing director, stated that Permavoid\-related products, drawing on this research, make up 60% of total sales for the company, who in 2019 had a turnover of £2 million \(S5\). 

 He noted that much of the SEL collaboration with CU, “related to Permavoid systems and the many ways that they can be deployed, to attenuate water, gases and pollution \(and\) has been fundamental to our technical and commercial development as a company. As described in the case study, we have won many drainage and gas migration installations due to our collaboration with Coventry University” \(S5,S10\). 

 As acknowledged above, CU research revealing new SuDS properties has been invested in product development, generating new designs, new products and impact in the environmental sector. Testing of Permavoid at CU has inspired a range of new patented SEL drainage products, brought to market from 2004\-2020. Of these, SEL have sold kilometres of novel linear drainage and water treatment products including Permaceptors, Permachannels and virtual curtain explosive gas migration barriers, with 50 UK schemes \(S5\). 



 Permavoid drainage is now used at Tottenham football stadium \(2019\) and the refurbished Anfield Stadium, Liverpool \(2017, pictured above\), where it prevents match postponement for a combined 2.2m supporters per annum – a significant cultural impact \(S9\). The Chief Executive Office of the Institute of Groundmanship attributes Liverpool’s 2019\-20 Premier League title win in part to the “revitalised pitch benefits” delivered through the CU\-informed Permavoid design, which contributed to their achievement of “100 points from their last 102 available on offer at home” \(S9\). Permavoid systems drain 161,860 m<sup>2</sup> of sports pitches in the UK alone representing 5 sports \(S5, S8\). 

 SEL used CU research on gas migration prevention technology to develop gas protection schemes, protecting human life from explosions arising from landfill gases leaking into buildings, and enabling regeneration of difficult environments. Using CU\-trialled Permavoid design criteria to separate methane and water, in 2017, SEL vented gases from a site in Warrington, allowing safe construction of an £11,850,000 development: 104 low\-rise dwellings, roads and parking. \(S4\). This achievement also built on our original publication \(R3\). SEL have installed Permavoid in 9 countries: UK, Ireland, USA, Bahrain, Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Belgium, Poland \(S5\). 



 The KTP project with SEL from 2017 – 2019, demonstrated ecological impact, placing retrofit green roofs onto existing infrastructure \(pictured above\). Research has enabled better water management alongside habitat enhancement \(S6,\). An independently conducted ecological survey revealed 5 insect species with national and local rarity value, from a total of 120 insect species on the green roofs at Coventry University \(S7\). The innovation in green roofs improved and increased the total constructed habitat for rare insects \(S6\).  This research has been incorporated into SEL’s product range, where green roofs are now used across four sites in Coventry, London, Aylesford and Blackburn.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Biodiversity faces anthropogenic threats including habitat loss and disturbance. University of Bristol research into the effect of these threats has informed guidance and policy for bat conservation nationally and internationally, especially in the EU: new UK licensing procedures now require compulsory training of consultants in the methods established by our research. Changes to policy and practice have ensured the conservation of threatened bat roosts, including historic and culturally significant buildings. Consensus between historic building and wildlife conservation groups has improved the public perception of bats, especially important given increased negative perceptions during the COVID\-19 pandemic. Collaborative research with ecological consultancies has also informed the development of acoustic deterrents for bat mitigation at large infrastructure projects. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) lists a third of bat species globally as threatened or data deficient. Loss of roost and foraging sites is the greatest threat to bat species worldwide, and many bat populations are in decline. Evidence\-based research is fundamental for informing national and international conservation policy and practice for the management of bat populations. Bat species play crucial ecological roles as pollinators, seed dispersers and suppressors of pests in many ecosystems yet are among the most under\-studied mammals. University of Bristol \(UoB\) research \[1\-6\] led by Prof Gareth Jones has been used to inform conservation decisions to mitigate negative impacts and manage protected bat species with a particular focus on historic buildings and artificial light at night. 

 Churches are important features of the historic landscape of England. Damage to historical artefacts from bat urine and droppings is a widespread problem. Bats are legally protected because of historic population declines, hence developing mutually beneficial solutions for both bats and church conservation is important. In collaboration with the Bat Conservation Trust, Natural England and the Church of England, and with funding from Defra, SITA Trust and English Heritage \[i\-iii\], UoB research assessed the impact of management actions for bat populations. Radio\-tracking data and population modelling showed that excluding bats from churches is likely to have a negative impact on their welfare and conservation status, but that novel solutions such as judicious use of deterrents, especially high intensity ultrasound, and construction of bespoke roost spaces can mitigate problems \[1\]. Acoustic deterrents have also been implemented in novel ways to potentially deter bats from tunnels along proposed high\-profile railway developments \[iv, v\], following evidence\-based research \[2\]. Novel methodologies were evaluated by using thermal imaging cameras to monitor how bats responded to broadcast ultrasound via a BBSRC Impact Acceleration award \[vi\]. 

 Large roosts of bats can cause problems in domestic dwellings. Radio tracking was employed to investigate the impact of exclusion from dwellings on survival, roosting and foraging behaviour. Following exclusion, soprano pipistrelles found alternative roosts and no difference in roosting or foraging behaviour before and after exclusion was found. Population modelling showed that any reduction in survival following exclusion could have a negative impact on population growth, whereas a reduction in productivity would have less effect. While the number of soprano pipistrelle exclusions currently licensed each year is likely to have little effect on local populations, the cumulative impacts of licensing the destruction of large numbers of roosts would be of concern \[3\]. 

 NERC\-funded UoB research \[vii, viii\] has also investigated the impact of artificial street lighting for bat behaviours crucial for survival, including foraging and reproduction. Bats are almost exclusively nocturnal and therefore highly vulnerable to artificial lighting at night. The research revealed negative effects of street lighting on bats, including changes in the use of established flight routes and commuting behaviour \[4\]; it has also identified consequences of switching to novel LED and metal halide lighting \[5\], which reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This research highlighted the complexities of simultaneously meeting targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss, and the need to carefully test new technologies. The research also identified potential mitigation methods such as dimming or spectral change to minimise the detrimental effects of lighting on bats \[6\].

#  Informed conservation guidance and policy nationally and internationally 

 UoB research led by Prof Jones is cited in European guidance for the conservation and management of bats, including the 2018 European Commission’s ‘Action Plan for the Conservation of All Bat Species in the European Union \(2018\-2024\)’ \[A\]. Research outlined here on artificial lighting \[4, 5\] resulted in authorship of the Eurobats publication ‘Guidelines for consideration of bats in lighting project’ \[B\]. The guidelines were developed in pursuance of Resolution 7.13 on Implementation of the Conservation and Management Plan established under the EU Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, commissioned by the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\)/EUROBATS Secretariat \(Bonn\). Artificial light at night is increasing globally in quantity, especially through street lighting, and the spectral quality of lighting is changing due to the transition to LEDs. Our research \[4, 5, 6\] has informed recommendations to limit the impacts of artificial light on: i\) feeding areas and commuting routes \(Table 5.1 p.39.\), and ii\) on roosts \(Table 5.3 p.43.\)  \[B\]. For example, the recommendation *‘conserve dark areas’* was informed by \[4\], and *‘adapt lamp spectra’* by \[5\] and \[6\]. 

 Concurrently in 2018, updated UK guidance covering ‘Bats and artificial lighting’ produced by the Bat Conservation Trust \(BCT\) and Institute for Lighting Professionals \(ILP\) \[C\], incorporated the body of work led by Jones \[e.g. 4\-6\], which *‘significantly increased \[our\] knowledge about the impact of artificial lighting’* \[H\] and recommended measures for mitigating impacts of artificial lighting. The lighting research \[4, 5\] also informed Defra’s Biodiversity 2020 report \[D\], which cites this work to highlight the vulnerability of bats to light pollution \(p.67\). 

#  Informed new licensing procedures and changing practice in ecological consultancies 

 Protection by law requires that anyone surveying bats must have a licence to prevent disturbance of roosts. UoB research has resulted in the introduction of new licensing procedures for training bat conservation consultants to implement mitigation in churches \[E\]. The English Statutory Nature Conservation Organisation, Natural England, brought in new licensing arrangements in 2015 to train consultants in our methods proposed and developed in \[1\], such as installing bespoke bat boxes \[E\]. The team at Natural England responsible for developing the ‘Bats in Churches Class Licence’ note that studies led by Prof Jones *‘have informed the content of the licence itself \(e.g. licensed activities, conditions\) and guidance’* \[F\]. To date 27 ecologists from commercial and public bodies carrying out ecological surveys have been successfully trained in these new methodologies and are currently registered to use the licence \[H\] and bat mitigation systems have been installed in seven churches despite limitations on implementation caused by COVID\-19 in 2020 \[Jiii\]. 

 The Bat Conservation Trust \(BCT\) runs training courses for professional ecologists and cites Prof Jones’ work extensively to inform practice guidance, including acoustic surveys, radio tracking including 20 papers cited in ‘Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists’ \[H\]. These guidelines are *‘the authoritative reference for bat surveys by Natural England, Scottish Natural Heritage, Natural Resource Wales and Northern Ireland Environment Agency licensing’* \[I\]. 

 Our work on acoustic deterrence \[2\] evolved into developing methods for deterring bats from tunnels along the proposed HS2 route. The research involved collaboration with the Ecology Consultancy, linking academics with practitioners, proved effective in deterring bats, and won two awards from the Acoustics & Noise Consultants \(2019\) \[I\]. 

#  Conserved roosts of threatened bat species and aided conservation of historic and culturally significant buildings 

 Since 2017, GBP5,000,000 of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund has been secured for mitigation actions, bringing together church and wildlife conservation groups \[H\]. This funding is being used to deliver a five\-year partnership project, bringing together wildlife, heritage conservation and church organisations to save bats and protect churches so that future generations can enjoy and benefit from both. The project is supporting 102 of the most severely impacted church communities across 26 counties in England, to reduce the negative consequences of bats on the church, without harming the bats. The churches supported are *‘home to locally and even nationally important roosts’* \[H\]. 

 The project is also creating a new network of fully trained volunteers who can undertake bat surveys and support congregations who have bat roosts at their church. The network also provides training for professional ecologists and historic building specialists in new techniques, enhancing knowledge and improve their advice to congregations. In 2016, a one\-day conference was attended by national and local representatives from the church, built heritage and conservation sectors \[H\]. Natural England is working in partnership with the Church of England, Historic England, Bat Conservation Trust, and the Churches Conservation Trust to deliver this ambitious and innovative project. Key outcomes to date include: 

#  i\) Created consensus between historic building and wildlife conservation groups 

 Prior to our work, considerable conflict existed between church conservation groups and bat conservationists. St Nicholas’ Church in Stanford on Avon is a Grade 1 listed building that contains monuments dating from the 16th\-19th century. Many of these monuments were damaged by bat droppings and urine, with >GBP60,000 spent on restoring them. Underpinning research \[1\] led to exclusion of the bats from the roost, whilst providing suitable alternative roosts located nearby, verified through radio tracking. In effect, artificial roosts have been created on the outside and the inside of the church, and there are signs that these are beginning to be used. The congregation at St Nicholas’ are delighted with the results and are beginning further restoration of the church artefacts. 

#  ii\) Changed public perception of bats 

 Work on the ceiling at a church in Braunston\-in\-Rutland has stopped droppings and urine entering the church, and church services can now proceed without clearing of bat droppings \[H, Ji\]. The church has engaged with bat conservation and held a ‘beer and bats evening’ on International Bat Night. The success was documented via the BBC News website \[Jii\], and in the Daily Telegraph, and the work was implemented after the local MP raised the situation with the Church Commissioner in Parliament. 

 Feedback from the Bats in Churches project has highlighted the change in attitudes and enthusiasm of congregations and local communities \[H\]: 

 *“We all learnt a lot about bats and what the Bats in Churches project is endeavouring to achieve … we all felt more positive about all the problems we have been enduring over the past years”* \(Church warden, St Edmund’s, Egleton\). 

 *“Explaining and showing the children how this issue is a local one and how they can help really motivated them to think about how we can help make sure bats are looked after* 

 *without damaging our local churches.”* \(Teacher, Rissington School\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Abortion in England & Wales is at its highest recorded rate, but women who experience abortion often feel isolated and stigmatised. Professor **Hoggart** and Dr **Newton’s** research on women’s experiences of abortion highlighted the problems of stigma and identified ways to combat it. They initiated a programme of activities with abortion providers, and women who have experienced abortion. Resulting public engagement activities have improved knowledge, made strides towards normalising abortion, and challenged abortion\-related stigma. In addition, the research has: helped to change the way information is provided for women at national abortion services in England; contributed to new curriculum in relationships and sex education \(RSE\); contributed to a change in the abortion law in Northern Ireland; and resulted in the formation of a new charity. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research by **Hoggart** and **Newton** produced a body of work that provides unique insights into the ways in which women experience internalised abortion\-related stigma in contexts of social stigma and enacted stigma \(for example where treatment is negatively affected by stigma felt by healthcare workers\) **\[O1\]**. The underpinning research was a significant mixed methods study funded by Marie Stopes International and conducted between 2012 and 2015. The overall objective of the study was to investigate different aspects of young women's \(aged 16\-24\) experiences of one or more unintended pregnancies ending in abortion. The first phase of the research was a quantitative telephone survey with 430 women following an abortion at one of Marie Stopes’ main centres. The second phase, for which **Hoggart** and **Newton** were responsible at the OU, was qualitative longitudinal research. Thirty\-six young women were interviewed following their abortion. Seventeen of these participants were interviewed for a second time approximately five to eight months later. The interviews and data collection were followed by data analysis, and report writing. 

 The analysis showed how respondents internalised a perception of abortion as morally questionable and socially unacceptable \(social stigma\) and that in some instances they had experienced stigmatising treatment \(enacted stigma\) **\[O2\]**. In the qualitative interviews, abortion\-related stigma was a feature in all the women’s recollections of their abortion journey, and some women recounted instances of encountering abortion negativity, from family and friends and by practitioners, that caused referral delays. The qualitative research findings highlighted the negative effects that internalised abortion stigma can have on women who have experienced an abortion; it leads many to feel ashamed of their action and blame themselves for what they felt was generally viewed as moral transgression. In particular, the research shows that abortion stigma is associated with secrecy and shame around abortion experiences. The extent to which women internalised abortion stigma differed between participants. There was strong evidence that popular discourses about abortion had influenced how many young women felt about their decision: *“I just felt like a bit of a wrong ‘un, you know”* **\[O3**, p.28 **\]**. 

 The research findings led to recommendations **\[O3**, p.30 **\]** about how to reduce the stigmatisation of women who access abortion\(s\): 

-  By establishing the ordinariness of abortion, so that women who experience an abortion do not feel they have transgressed, or that they are alone. 

-  By ensuring women receive non\-judgmental abortion care. 

-  By ensuring that Relationships and Sexuality Education \(RSE\) includes non\-judgmental, non\-moralistic, discussion of abortion within its remit. 

-  By creating resources that tell the stories of women’s abortion experiences \(from the research\) which helps women undergoing an abortion to feel less alone and stigmatised. 

 **Hoggart** and **Newton** drew on their research to develop relevant theory concerning abortion\-related stigma **\[O1\-O6\]**. This shows how internalised stigma is magnified for women who have more than one abortion **\[O4\]** but also how labelling reveals an implicit assumption of abortion as morally wrong, an important driver of internalised abortion stigma **\[O2\]**. They point to stigma resistance and rejection as important elements of stigma that are often ignored **\[O1\]**. They developed theory on moral agency, arguing that women who are morally confident and thus exercise moral agency are less likely to internalise abortion stigma **\[O2\]**. Finally, they assessed a number of other studies to examine closely language \(the ‘explanatory schema’\) that women draw upon to challenge abortion\-related stigma **\[O5\]**; and how health care professionals may themselves internalise abortion\-related stigma as well as unwittingly enact stigma **\[O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 A new consortium was created to build on the research \(Dialogue Workshop \- **G2**, My Body My Life \- **G3**\) which includes abortion providers \(British Pregnancy Advisory Service \(BPAS\), Marie Stopes United Kingdom \(MSUK\), as well as national advisory services and policy makers \(Public Health England, Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, British Society of Abortion Care Providers\), and providers of sexual health and contraception \(Brook, Family Planning Association\). A key pathway to impact is through an interactive abortion story\-telling initiative – *My Body My Life* \( *MBML*\). MBML is a travelling exhibition, website, and booklet **\[**evaluation **C1\]**. The consortium has undertaken a programme of public engagement, based on the research, which has challenged abortion stigma with beneficial effects for service providers, practitioners, people who have had an abortion and the wider public. 

 **Impact on information provided to women at the time of their abortion** 

 The two main abortion providers in the UK \(BPAS and MSUK\) have developed and adopted stigma\-challenging initiatives to improve women’s abortion experiences as a direct result of recommendations from **Hoggart** and **Newton’s** research **\[O3\]**. BPAS worked with **Hoggart** on an abortion story\-telling booklet *MBML: real stories of abortion* **\[C2\]**. This initiative has been positively evaluated in an independent evaluation **\[C1\]** which illustrates the meaningfulness of the booklet for practitioners and their end\-clients. The report recommended that booklets should be made available electronically for women when they first contact BPAS \(approximately 90,000 women per year\), and that BPAS make hard copies of the booklet available in all their clinics. BPAS reached the decision that the booklet “ *helps to reassure them* \[women\] *their lives will be okay”* **\[C3\]**, and actioned both these recommendations ordering a further 500 booklets to retain in their waiting rooms, and placing the electronic booklet prominently in information sent to women **\[C2\]**. The booklet is available in all BPAS clinic waiting rooms \(over 40 clinics\) and online on the BPAS website. In addition, the second largest abortion provider, MSUK \(who commissioned the original research\), responded by developing a women’s story\-telling section on their website and stocking the *MBML* booklet, noting that “ *a booklet of women’s experiences was invaluable in prompting questions clients might have about their own abortions”* **\[C4\]**. It is estimated that since 2018 over 400,000 women have had direct access to the booklet through abortion providers. 

 **Impact on service providers** 

 The research led to increased awareness that abortion providers need to provide sensitive, compassionate and – above all – non\-judgmental care to women who use their services. The evaluation report noted clinic staff “ *felt the booklet has potential to raise awareness and understanding of the different circumstances that lead to an abortion and that this knowledge can help clients feel comforted and less isolated”* **\[C1**, p.12 **\]**. The research has also changed counselling practice at BPAS. The lead counsellor at BPAS recommends that all counsellors read the booklet and promote it to clients: “ *I use it in my own face\-to\-face counselling with clients and in my supervisorial role as lead counsellor I have recommended that other counsellors also use it”* **\[C3\]**. The *MBML* exhibition has been invited to large national and international medical conferences. The exhibition was showcased at the British Society of Abortion Care Providers conference and two significant and influential international conferences \(FIAPAC international conference of abortion and contraception providers \[456 participants\] and 2019 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Global Congress \[over 4,000 attendees\]\). An evaluation **\[C1**, p. 23 **\]** of the impact of the exhibition at FIAPAC showed that a high proportion of practitioner respondents agreed the exhibition is useful for their work \(83%\) and 76% thought that ‘ *visiting the MBML exhibition helped to increase my understanding of women’s experiences of abortio*n’ **\[C1**, p.23 **\]**.  Some of the written comments indicated that respondents had become more reflexive in their practice “ *I believe it helps us as practitioners to understand the experience from a woman’s perspective*” **\[C1**, p. 22 **\]**. Following its success at FIAPAC, the exhibition was invited to the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health Conference in Dublin, May 2020, the largest international conference of relevant practitioners \(re\-scheduled for October 2021\). 

 **Impact on public awareness of the normality of abortion**The *MBML* public engagement exhibition has had considerable reach **\[C1\]**, having been open to the general public in six venues in Edinburgh, Oxford, Belfast, and London. By the final public exhibition in London 2018 *MBML* had achieved: over 1,200 exhibition visitors; over 140 stories submitted \(online and hard copy\); 13,726 website views; 691 Twitter followers and >300,000 impressions between July 2017 and February 2018; over 350 attendees at speaker events; and, circa 1,000 views on YouTube **\[C5\]**. The exhibition also enjoyed substantial reach through media coverage, including pieces in The Independent and Metro. A BuzzFeed social media piece that led with the headline, Women Are Sharing Their Abortion Stories To Try To Tackle The Stigma Of Ending A Pregnancy, was highly visual showing many images from the exhibition and was visited 1,628,000 times **\[C5\]**.The *MBML* exhibition has also had a significant and meaningful impact on people who have visited it **\[C1\]** demonstrated through stories submitted on the website. Of 345 responses, the quantitative data is overwhelmingly positive, and written responses show how the exhibition raised visitor awareness about the incidence of abortion and the range of circumstances leading to an abortion: “ *I found the experience eye\-opening. Got me to consider issues I wouldn’t usually”*; *“I had never thought about how abortions could happen as a result of medical issues and finance. Before this I assumed it was young girls who had made a mistake, I didn't think it was as common in older people who already have children*” **\[C1**, p.14 **\]**. 

 Using the research MSUK launched their own \#SmashAbortionStigma campaign which also involves collecting women’s abortion stories for the MSUK website. The collaboration continued with the advocacy and public affairs advisor noting *“the My Body My Life website was an important resource for MSUK because it collected testimonies of women’s past experiences of abortion to augment the recent testimonies of clients that were coming through the MSUK website*” **\[C4\]**. 

 **Impact on women who have had abortion**   Perhaps the most profound impact has been on women who have had an abortion. The exhibition had a powerful effect on visitors, especially those who had experienced an abortion or supported someone close to them through abortion. Many comments reflected this: *“It made me feel less alone, that so many other women go through this.”* Over 140 women contributed their own abortion stories on a public storyboard and testified to the power of the project. One of the visitors who had experienced an abortion later submitted her story to the website: *“I am grateful to the exhibition and this portal which has helped me heal. It made me feel I am not the only one. It made me feel connected to strangers who have had this experience and I am ever grateful to you for this”* **\[C1**, p.21 **\]**. The report on booklet use in abortion clinics also noted the positive impact the booklet has had on women attending BPAS clinics, with high levels of agreement with the statement: *“the booklet helped me to understand how common it is for women to have an abortion”;* and comments, such as: “ *it has put me at ease knowing that a lot of other women have or are going through the same as me. I feel more comfortable and openminded, not under pressure”; “It made me feel less alone and that so many other women go through this”* **\[C1**, p.11 **\]**. 

 **Impact on change in law in Northern Ireland** 

 The research supported campaigning activities in Northern Ireland that contributed to a change in the abortion law in October 2019 **\[C6\]**. **Hoggart** has twice presented the abortion research at the Northern Ireland Assembly Knowledge Exchange Seminars; and has worked closely with Alliance for Choice \(AFC\), a civil movement in Northern Ireland which campaigned for the decriminalisation of abortion and continues to campaign to end abortion discrimination. The co\-convenor of AFC confirmed “ *My Body My Life contributed to the campaign to end abortion criminalisation in Northern Ireland and continues to contribute to the campaign to end abortion stigmatisation and discrimination*” **\[C6\]**. As part of AFC’s activities to normalise abortion, *MBML* visited Belfast in December 2017 achieving over 1,000 visitors \(exhibition and associated events\) **\[C6\]**. The MBML booklet has been used in community workshops and by AFC for their campaigning and advocacy in briefings to Westminster MPs and peers and in a submission to the Women and Equalities Committee Inquiry on Abortion in Northern Ireland **\[C6\]**. AFC’s report on the community workshops describes *MBML* overall as “ *an essential tool in tackling abortion stigma, breaking the silence and normalising abortion as part of reproductive healthcare”* a change that was an essential prerequisite for legal reform **\[C7\]**. 

 **Influencing relationships and sex education in schools Hoggart** and **Newton’s** research had noted that it was important to include material that helped young people understand about the commonality of abortion in Relationships and Sex Education \(RSE\) **\[O3\]**. As a result, the OU developed a course on abortion with Brook Learn, for teachers delivering RSE. This course is non\-moralistic and offers a radical change to the tone and nature of abortion information designed for school students: *“The e\-learning module on abortion was designed to give secondary school teachers a training on teaching abortion in a way that prompted them to question their own values”* **\[C8a\]**. Material from the abortion research, from the booklet, and from the *MBML* exhibition \(including stories\) is embedded in the course **\[C8b\]**. 

 The Brook Learn abortion course was launched in March 2020 **\[C8b\]**. Brook Learn courses are currently taken up by an average of around 900 teachers/trainers but due to COVID this has been delayed. Evaluation of a pilot noted: “ *the \[MBML\] videos added to the learning experience providing real stories told by actors that helped personalise what otherwise could be quite an abstract subject. The videos helped teachers feel more prepared to teach RSE, and not only helped them to be more aware of the different circumstances young people faced with an unplanned pregnancy, but also highlighted examples and scenarios that they could use in class*” **\[C9**, p.14 **\]**. 

 **A new charity** 

 The research was foundational to the formation of a new UK abortion charity \(number 297667\), named *Abortion Talk.* The primary objectives of the charity are to develop online resources which challenge abortion stigma in society and offer information and support; provide a helpline and tailored discussion space and support for people affected by abortion; present provider workshops to share information, resources and support; provide safe spaces for people emotionally affected by abortion to talk, and seek support, around their experiences; and, provide a social media platform for talking about these experiences. The charity is supported by the British Society for Abortion Care Providers, BPAS, Brook Young People and Doctors for Choice; and will start the helpline and workshops early in 2021. *MBML* is a core element of the charity, as noted by one of the founder members: “ *MBML has been central to the setting up of this new charity which will challenge the stigma and accepted secrecy around abortion by providing a helpline and workshops where people can discuss their experiences, including the emotional impact, of having/providing abortions”* **\[C10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 McKillop’s research has played a key role in shaping a dramatic transformation of the credit union sector in Ireland; much of this change has occurred since August 2013. The transformation has, in part, emanated from a series of recommendations made by a government\-appointed body, the Commission on Credit Unions \(CCU\), which was chaired by McKillop and drew extensively on his research. Research on regulatory change has helped guide the introduction of a strengthened regulatory framework to promote financial stability and offer diversification opportunities for credit unions. Research on mergers has influenced industry consolidation as credit unions, through transfers of engagements, have sought efficiency gains. Research on organisational change has helped to progress business model development through the identification of change enablers.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 McKillop, over the course of the past twenty\-five years has developed a considerable body of research on credit unions in the US, Canada and Ireland. This research is invariably empirical in form and based upon extensive panel datasets. Work on US credit unions is undertaken with Goddard \(Professor Emeritus, University of Bangor\) and Wilson \(Professor, St Andrews University\) and jointly contributed to in each instance. Work on Irish and Canadian credit unions is led by McKillop and undertaken with Glass \(Professor Emeritus, University of Ulster\), Hyndman \(Professor Emeritus, Queen’s University Belfast\), Goth and Rasaratnam, \(PhD students of McKillop\) and Quinn \(Lecturer, Queen’s University Belfast\). Three of the issues on which McKillop’s research has focused are regulatory change, sectoral consolidation, and business model development. 

 *Regulatory Change* 

 Research \(with Goth and Hyndman\) compared governance in Irish and Canadian credit unions. The analysis found that the governance process in Irish credit unions had not accommodated or responded to developments elsewhere in corporate governance. For many Irish credit unions governance was little more than a regulatory technicality, and not an instrument for improving board quality \[ **R1**\]. Research \(with Glass and Rasaratnam\) investigated regulatory compliance and found that regulatory guidance, particularly with regard to bad debt, resulted in a deterioration in non\-parametric measures of efficiency for a third of all Irish credit unions \[ **R3**\]. Research \(with Goddard and Wilson\) investigated the capitalisation of US credit unions before and after the introduction of the capital adequacy regulatory framework in 2000. The research found that capitalization varied pro\-cyclically and, until the financial crisis of 2008, credit unions classified as adequately capitalized or below followed a faster adjustment path than well capitalized credit unions. This pattern was reversed in the aftermath of the crisis \[ **R5**\]. 

 *Sectoral Consolidation \(Mergers\)* 

 The comparative research, referred to above, on governance in Irish and Canadian credit unions identified the importance of strategic mergers in the promotion of stability and the generation of member benefits. In contrast, mergers between strong and weak credit unions resulted in a dilution in membership focus, an increase in loan arrears and reduced dividends \[ **R1**\]. Research on industry structure \(with Goddard and Wilson\) explored the impact of exit through merger and acquisition \(M&A\), or through failure and internally generated growth, on the size distribution of credit unions in the US. The research found that M&A was the principal cause of the reduction in US credit union numbers, but that its impact on concentration was small. Divergence between the internally generated growth of smaller and larger credit unions was the principal driver of a rise in concentration \[ **R4**\]. 

 *Business Model Development* 

 Research \(with Goddard and Wilson\) investigated the influence of diversification on business model development. The analysis found that small credit unions should avoid diversification and continue to operate as simple savings and loan institutions while large credit unions should exploit new opportunities around their core expertise \[ **R2**\]. McKillop and his Queen’s Management School colleague, Barry Quinn, examined complexity and diversity in the business model of Irish credit unions. Three classes of business models were identified with two of the three classes subject to diseconomies of scale. The analysis concluded that such complexity and diversity could not be accommodated within a one size fits all regulatory framework \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 McKillop’s research has played a key role in effecting and shaping a dramatic transformation of the credit union sector in Ireland; much of this change has occurred since August 2013. The transformation has, in part, emanated from recommendations made by the CCU, chaired by McKillop, which drew extensively on his research \[ **A, C**\]. By June 2016, 48 of the 54 recommendations made by the CCU had been enacted through the Credit Union and Co\-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, either by regulation or by other means \[ **B**\]. 

 *Regulatory change* 

 The recommendations which drew, in particular, on McKillop’s research concerned enhanced reserves, liquidity and capital requirements, and other prudential and governance measures \[ **C, D**\]. The introduction of the strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions began on 1 August 2013 with the commencement of a bespoke fitness and probity regime for credit unions followed by new governance and prudential requirements on 11 October 2013. The remaining sections of the 2012 Act, which were commenced on 1 January 2016, provided the Central Bank with the power to make regulations. The 2016 regulations covered reserves, liquidity, lending, investments, savings, and borrowings, building on existing prudential and governance requirements in these areas \[ **E**\]. 

 At the launch of these regulations, in January 2016, the Registrar of Credit Unions, Anne Marie McKiernan, said: 

 The Report of the CCU made a number of recommendations regarding the strengthening of the regulatory framework for credit unions. These regulations mark a further important step in the development of a strengthened regulatory framework for the credit union sector and will contribute to the maintenance of the financial stability of the sector \[ **E**\]. 

 The improved regulatory framework made a positive impact on the sector, as Patrick Casey, then the Registrar of Credit Unions, observed in November 2018: 

 We see higher performing credit unions have typically moved beyond a mere ‘tick box’ compliance attitude to exhibit a more rounded governance culture, with the board and management teams demonstrating strong risk awareness and understanding \[ **F**\]. 

 Commenting on the contribution of McKillop’s research, the head of the Department of Finance’s Shareholder and Financial Advisory Division noted: 

 The academic research on credit unions undertaken by Professor McKillop helped inform the work of the CCU, the Credit Union Advisory Committee \(CUAC\) and the work of the Department of Finance. Professor McKillop’s work in these roles was instrumental in  the delivery  of  in\-depth  policy research and  practical  recommendations  which  could be  progressed by  legislators,  regulators and the credit union sector itself  \[ **C**\]. 

 *Sectoral Consolidation \(Mergers\)* 

 One of the key recommendations made by the CCU was the establishment of a credit union restructuring board. In response to this recommendation, the Irish government established the Credit Union Restructuring Board \(ReBo\) in January 2013. Restructuring was a way of addressing weaknesses in the sector and a business strategy for credit unions that wanted to achieve the scale necessary to move to a more sophisticated business model \[ **A**\]. McKillop’s research on the importance of strategic mergers to yield scale and scope economies helped influence the types of mergers encouraged and supported by ReBo \[ **G**\]. When ReBo ceased its restructuring operations on 31 March 2017, it had supported 82 mergers involving 156 credit unions with total assets in excess of €6.7bn \(approximately 50% of the total assets of the sector\) \[ **H**\]. 

 As Bobby McVeigh the Chair of ReBo, noted in July 2017: 

 Positive outcomes have been evidenced in the credit union sector’s financial stability as a result of the mergers enacted, and perhaps just as importantly, a marked positive difference in the credit union attitude toward restructuring has been effected throughout the sector \[ **H**\]. 

 At the launch of the Central Bank’s thematic review of restructuring, in February 2019, the Registrar of Credit Unions, Patrick Casey, observed: 

 Since 2013 restructuring has transformed the sector, as credit unions transferred to become part of larger, stronger credit unions, with multiple business locations. Today’s report highlights that credit unions that have completed transfers are delivering higher lending growth and improved cost to income metrics compared to peers \[ **I**\]. 

 Commenting on the contribution of McKillop’s research, the CEO of Credit Union Development Association \(CUDA\), and member of the ReBo board \(January 2014 to July 2017\) noted: 

 … Donal and his colleagues’ work on credit union transfer of engagements helped shape ReBo’s approach to restructuring, in particular its emphasis on building up stronger credit unions to ensure that restructuring does not reward failure and that ultimately members benefit from being part of a much stronger entity \[ **G**\]. 

 *Business Model Development* 

 CCU stated that business model choice could vary from a simple savings and loan model to a more complex and broader product mix model. However, greater complexity necessitates more stringent regulatory requirements \[ **A**\]. McKillop’s research has helped inform business model choice by highlighting that diversification may be detrimental for small credit unions and, although large credit unions are better placed to exploit new opportunities, diversification should be tied to core product areas \[ **J**\]. To support business model development, the Central Bank in 2019 issued new lending measures which enabled larger and better capitalised credit unions to engage in longer term lending including home mortgage and business lending. 

 Introducing the changes in November 2019, the Registrar of Credit Unions, Patrick Casey said: 

 The amending regulations represent significant and fundamental structural framework changes, providing sufficient capacity and flexibility to enable safe and sound business model transformation on a sustainable basis serving members’ long term interests \[ **K**\]. 

 In September 2018, the Central Bank facilitated the establishment of a CEO led Business Model Forum \(chaired by McKillop\) to identify change enablers that would facilitate business model development. The work of the CEO Forum in the intervening period has been outcomes\-focused and has delivered product solutions, a collaborative model, and intermediated services \[ **L**\]. 

 Commenting on the contribution of McKillop’s research on business model development, the Chairman of CUNA Mutual Group Europe, a leading global provider of financial solutions to Credit Unions and Mutuals, noted: 

 Professor McKillop and his research colleagues have empirically assessed the constraints faced by credit unions in developing their business model\(s\) and explored means through which constraints can be overcome, most notably through collaborative ventures. This research has been influential to the thinking of a variety of stakeholders including Credit Unions, their representative bodies and the Central Bank \[ **J**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Woodthorpe’s research at University of Bath has demonstrated that Government support for low\-income households facing funeral costs is unclear, inconsistent and ineffective. It has led to reforms in the UK Funeral Payment scheme, making it more accessible and transparent. It influenced the Scottish Government, in their policy review and their 2017 plan for funeral payment reform. It has prompted a wider investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\) into the funeral industry and funeral costs. It has shifted public understanding.  There are significant impacts in terms of the social welfare of low\-income households, the transparency of benefit administration and the regulation and competitiveness of the funeral industry.

 **2. Underpinning research** *\[numbers in square brackets refer to the references in Section 3\]* 

 From 2011 to 2014, Woodthorpe developed a body of research at the University of Bath on funeral costs, with support from AXA Sun Life Insurance.  Funeral directors and their representative trade bodies had been lobbying for raising the maximum amount that could be awarded to claimants of the DWP Funeral Payment. 

 The initial research examined the experience of claimants and other stakeholders and evaluated the efficiency of the DWP Social Fund Funeral Payment \(FP\) \(now renamed Funeral Expenses Payment\). Woodthorpe interviewed claimants from across the UK who had claimed a FP in the two years previously, as well as funeral directors, funeral sector trade organisations and local authorities. She found that the process of application lacked coherence, with considerable confusion regarding eligibility and what the FP could and would cover.  FP claimants were obliged to incur funeral costs before submitting their claim.  Moreover, even if successful, many claimants fell into debt **\[1\]**. The system also failed to take account of the diversity of family relationships and obligations, which affected where the burden of funeral costs would fall **\[2\]**. 

 In 2012, Woodthorpe produced a report for AXA **\[1\]** based on this empirical research \(with academic publications following during 2013 and 2016\). This report recommended: 

-  Simplifying the guidance on the scope and remit of the FP; 

-  A rapid system for assessing eligibility of applicants for a FP, prior to incurring funeral costs; 

-  Negotiation by DWP with the funeral industry, over the definition of, and the price for, a basic funeral; 

-  Attention to the strength of relationships within the family of the deceased. 

 To contextualise and enable the development of policy recommendations, the research included a comparative analysis of state support for funerals in 18 countries, involving key informants **\[3\]**. The study examined the state mechanisms, processes and funding available for bereaved individuals and families when they could not afford a funeral. The findings indicate that the British system is hampered by a discourse of welfare dependency rather than entitlement, which stigmatises those who need support with funeral costs, at a time when they are under pressure to ensure that the deceased person receives a ‘dignified’ send\-off. 

 These research findings fed into the policy world through the AXA report and the policy briefs of our Institute of Policy Research in 2014 and 2017.  They were picked up by a wide range of policy actors, including the DWP Select Committee Special Enquiry in 2016, the Scottish Government’s policy review in 2017 and the CMA in 2018 \(see section 4 below\). 

 Subsequent publications **\[4,5,6\]** have raised larger issues exposed by this research, going beyond funeral costs and affordability, to include the family disputes which these sometimes provoke and the transparency and competitiveness of the funeral industry.

 **4. Details of the impact** *\[Letters in square brackets refer to references in Section 5\].* 

 Woodthorpe’s research has demonstrated that the public support for funeral costs facing low\-income households is unclear, inconsistent and ineffective.  Between 2014 and 2020 she has taken her findings to a wide range of stakeholders and policy actors: 

-  The research has led to a series of reforms in the UK Funeral Expenses Payment scheme, making it much clearer for applicants and more cost\-effective; 

-  It has influenced the Scottish Government, in their policy review and their 2017 plan for funeral payment reform; 

-  It has prompted a wider investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority into the transparency and competitiveness of the funeral industry; 

-  It has shifted public understanding of dying and funerals. 

 During 2020 Woodthorpe’s advice was sought by the UK Government with regards to the COVID\-19 \(SARS\-CoV\-2\) pandemic and funerals and for the production of guidance to support the bereaved **\[Evidence A\]**. 

1.  **Reforms to the UK Funeral Payment Scheme** 

 The findings of the AXA Report were picked up by a wide range of policy actors at Westminster.  Woodthorpe took her research to interested Parliamentarians, then to a DWP Select Committee \(where she was their Special Advisor\), then into the heart of Government, through a secondment to the DWP: 

 **2014:** The *All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Funerals and Bereavement* discussed Woodthorpe’s *IPR policy briefing: ‘*Funeral poverty in the UK’.  Woodthorpe then advised *the Member of Parliament for South Shields* on a Private Member’s Bill. 

 **2015:** Invited speaker at a further *Parliamentary Roundtable:* bringing together MPs and Industry to discuss the Funeral Payment Scheme. 

 **2016:** Special Advisor to *Department for Work and Pensions Select Committee Inquiry into Bereavement Benefits:* Woodthorpe provided input to witness sessions, reports and recommendations to government for policy change **\[Evidence B\]**.  The Committee secretary writes: “ *Dr Woodthorpe supported throughout the inquiry. \[Her\] research was particularly important for the report’s analysis of the current problems and failings of the Social Fund Funeral Payment”* **\[Evidence C\]**.   The Government in June 2016 committed to take appropriate action. 

 **2017:** February–September: Secondment to the DWP *,* contributing an internal report on priority areas for change, and evidence for review of Social Fund Funeral Payments.  The Department confirms Woodthorpe’s key role “ *in applying her expertise in this specific field… \[so as to\] support reforms to the benefit”* **\[Evidence D\].** 

 A Parliamentary Briefing report \(2018\) by Kennedy and Gheera devotes the whole of chapter 8 to Woodthorpe’s research.  It shows that many of the recommendations in Woodthorpe’s original AXA Report were picked up in these Parliamentary processes and in the Government reforms of 2017 onwards **\[Evidence E\]**.  This is summarised in the Table below: 

| **AXA Recommendations** | **Policy Improvements during 2017\-20** |
| --- | --- |
| Simplified guidance on the scope and remit of the FP. | Improved the advice about eligibility for funeral payments on the UK Government’s website.  [](https://www.gov.uk/funeral-payments/eligibility) |
| A rapid system for assessing eligibility for FP, prior to incurring funeral costs. | Claim period extended, final invoice no longer needed, evidence can be submitted electronically, no penalty for raising funds from other sources before FP entitlement confirmed. |
| Establishment of a set price for a basic funeral, to decrease shortfall between FP award and actual cost. | Increase to the maximum award \(thereby reducing shortfall\). |
| Attention to the strength of relationships within the family of the deceased. | Simplification of rules on whom can claim \-partner, child, parent or sibling, step\- relationships. |

 The last Annual Report from the Social Fund \(covering 2018 and 2019\) shows the successful claim rate for FEP increased from 61% in 2016 and 2017, prior to the reforms, to 66.8%. This strongly suggests that the reforms have succeeded in making the process of application easier to understand and administer **\[Evidence F\]**. 

1.  **Scottish Government** 

 Woodthorpe was invited to the Scottish Government *Social Security Roundtable* on funeral poverty welfare reform in October 2016; and to their *National Conference on Funeral Poverty **,** in November that year.   She was invited on account of her “ *substantial research…., her overview and understanding of the issues, and … her track record of working with the UK Govt and the private sector”* **\[Evidence G\]**. 

 Woodhorpe then contributed to the Scottish Government policy review.  Her research findings were cited in Parliament as having *“important implications for existing and future demand for public health funerals*” **\[Evidence H** page 28 **\]**.  This culminated in Government publication of a 10\-point plan in 2017 and implementation of its Funeral Expense Assistance \(FEA\) benefit in Autumn 2019. 

 This was expected to cost approximately GBP8,300,000 per annum, and involve around 5,600 payments. The Scottish government’s first report covers the period between 16 September 2019 \(when the benefit started\) and 30 June 2020. In the event, they received 5,710 applications and awarded GBP6,000,000 worth of payments to 4,380 individuals.  Indeed, here the successful claim rate following the reforms was even higher than in England, at 77% compared with 66.8% \(see above\) **\[Evidence I\].** 

1.  **Funeral Industry** 

 More recently, the Government has moved to address wider issues foreshadowed in the original AXA report.  The 2016 DWP Select Committee Special Inquiry \(with Woodthorpe as Special Advisor\) recommended a Competitions and Markets Authority \(CMA\) investigation of the funeral sector. 

 CMA instigated this in 2018 and a full CMA review of funeral practice and costs followed in March 2019.  In July 2019, Woodthorpe gave evidence at a CMA hearing on whether a funeral was a ‘distress purchase’, exposing the purchaser to unfair pressure. Her published research and her hearing evidence are referred to frequently in the CMA’s final report \(2020\), which recommended that funeral directors publish their costs, that large\(r\) companies provide annual financial reports to the CMA, and that there should be a funeral regulator **\[Evidence J\]**. 

1.  **Public Understanding of Dying and Funerals** 

 Woodthorpe has been regularly involved in broadcasting and the media, helping to shape public understanding. She was an invited participant in BBC Radio 4 Moneybox and Joan Bakewell programmes in 2018; a BBC Breakfast interviewee in 2017; and substantial coverage in broadsheet newspapers and online **\[Evidence K\].** 

 Woodthorpe has been invited to join various forums that seek to shape public understanding of dying and which value her research contribution to this goal: 

-  She is the sole academic to have been invited into the *Dying Matters Advisory Group*.  This is a broad\-based, inclusive and rapidly growing national coalition, which aims to change public knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards dying, death and bereavement.  Funded by NHS England and Hospice UK, it supports the Department of Health’s End of Life Care Strategy. 

-  The Fair Funerals Campaign comments: “ *Woodthorpe’s expertise … around funeral poverty … provided much of the initial context for the Fair Funerals campaign. This work helped us demonstrate to funders, politicians and the media the need around funeral poverty and make a case for change*” **\[Evidence L\]**. 

 Woodthorpe is also the sole academic invited to be on the Funeral User Standards Group, a consumer representative body that is advising the newly created Funeral Consumer Group, established by the National Association of Funeral Directors, the Society for Allied Independent Funeral Directors, and the major funeral companies.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Fisheries are a critical part of the UK and global economy \(reflected in UN SDG 14\), worth $130 billion globally, €7.5 billion in Europe and almost £1 billion in the UK. Research conducted by Professor Barnes and colleagues at the University of Hull is shaping domestic and international fisheries governance in two significant ways: 

1.  by providing expert evidence to Parliamentary Committees and stakeholders, which is enabling scrutiny of Government policy, and shaping post\-Brexit policy and legislation on fishing in a way that advances public benefits; and 

1.  by advising and influencing the policy position of the WWF, enabling them to leverage change in fishing policy and practices around the world. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The operation of rights\-based fisheries management and international legal barriers to reform have been marginalised within the broader literature on fisheries management. The Marine and Maritime Institute \(MMI\) at the University of Hull, with its strong maritime heritage and world\-leading research, is advancing marine fisheries regulation. University of Hull research feeds into international research networks and has been pivotal in unpacking and explaining how social, economic and political forces shape regulation **\[R1, R2 & R6; G2\-5\].** Professor Barnes’ research shows how law is instrumental in shaping fisheries management options and policy instruments \(such as ‘smart regulation’\): how it can enable or constrain specific economic or political options for fisheries management and governance **\[R2\].** He was first to establish and explain the structural limits and features of international law that determine what form specific rules may take, especially for shared resources **\[R2; G1\],** and proposed theories of change to facilitate interventions in fisheries management and governance **\[R6\].** There key research findings underpin the impact: 

 **Key research finding 1: Legislating for fisheries management and governance** 

 The research broke new ground by showing how the regulation of fisheries must encompass certain public \(policy\) interests: meeting food supply needs, maintaining political and social order and protecting the interests of future generations **\[R2; G1\].** It extended this analysis to high seas fisheries, providing new insights into the tragedy of the commons debate. It further articulated how requirements of co\-operation and sustainability come from international fisheries law, and must be accommodated within domestic management regimes **\[R1\]**.  By demonstrating how international law sets limits on which policy instruments can be adopted by States to manage fisheries, the findings showed how domestic legal frameworks can support or diminish the effectiveness of fisheries management **\[R3; R4\].** 

 **Key research finding 2: Governance options for fisheries** 

 Fisheries management is a typical wicked problem. In light of the limits of traditional regulatory approaches, Barnes’ research shows how the rights\-based approaches and techniques of ‘smart regulation’ can and should be applied to international fisheries management and governance **\[R6\].** It therefore makes an important contribution to the new environmental policy instruments and new modes of governance literature **\[R1, 2, 4 & 6; C7\]**. This research was conducted as part of a WWF think tank **\[R4 & 5\]**, with action research in two tracks: to seek out information from regional fishing concerns and to provide practical scalable advice for fishery managers and industry. The findings show how to implement rights\-based approaches and instruments, which have been traditionally confined to domestic fisheries due to the institutional limitations of high seas fisheries. Barnes’ research shows how excludability of access can be enabled in law **\[R2, R6\].** Combining these research findings with insights from partners on a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation project **\[R5\],** we show how combinations of legal/non\-legal interventions in fishing practices can improve fisheries management on the high seas and contribute to UN SDG14 **\[R5; G1\-3\].**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Through international, interdisciplinary research projects and networks **\[G1\-5\]**, the research enabled dialogue between academics, practitioners and policy\-makers to better understand and address barriers to sustainable fisheries regulation **\[R4&6; G1&3\]**. This impact was manifest in two areas of policy/practice: 

 **\(1\) Shaping UK fisheries policy** 

 Barnes’ research has influenced the UK government’s post\-Brexit fisheries policy. Due to his recognised expertise in domestic and international fisheries law \[ **R1\-7**\], Barnes was invited to provide expert evidence to Westminster and Welsh Assembly committee inquiries on eight occasions in respect of the policy and the content of the Fisheries Bill. The House of Lords 2016 **\[C1\]**, the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee **\[C4\]**, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(EFRA\) Committee **\[C3\]** and the Welsh Assembly Climate Change, Environment and Rural Affairs Committee \(CCERA\) \[ **C6\]**, have all relied on this advice to inform: their scrutiny of Government policy on fisheries management post\-Brexit; the content of the Bill; and the decision to give legislative consent to a Bill. Barnes is cited more than 50 times in their reports. This influence has advanced public benefit in three key ways: 

 **\(i\) Embedding sustainable management and accountability in policy** 

 New provisions in the Fisheries Act 2020 evidence the influence of the underpinning research \[ **C12\]**. A critical element of this is advice **\[R2&3\]** on international obligations to cooperate in managing fisheries and ensuring the sustainable regulation of fishing: Commenting on the CFP and Law of the Sea Convention to the Lords European Union Committee, ‘Professor Barnes argued that fisheries management had to ‘proceed on the basis of co\-operation, without which we will have to go back to situations of competitive overfishing.’ **\[C1: 85\]** This resulted in the Committee recommendation that: ‘The UK should not discard the positive elements of the CFP that successive Governments have worked hard to achieve, such as sustainability and regional co\-operation.’ **\[C1: 87\]** In turn, this generated the Government response: ‘The Government … \[is\] ready to co\-operate with adjacent states to ensure that shared and straddling stocks are managed sustainably and effectively. We want to avoid the risk of over\-fishing at all costs.’ **\[C2: 2\]** 

 Other key advice that was followed by the Lord’s Committee included: the need to avoid a regulatory deficit in withdrawing from the CFP and to align UK policy with the CFP post\-Brexit **\[C1: 25& 52\]**; the need to address historic fishing rights **\[C1: 37&38\]**; the need to make access to surplus stocks available to other States **\[C1: 36\]**; the need to secure independent membership of RFMOs was accepted **\[C1: 198\-199\]**; and the need for continued structural funding for the industry recognised **\[C4: 115\]**. Drawing on his research **\[R2&3\]**, Barnes was a leading voice among academics whose advice, via the Committee findings, was accepted in the Government’s policy response on future UK fisheries management **\[C2: points 1, 2, 4, 11, 21, 22 & 34\]**, with corresponding provisions in the Fisheries Act 2020. 

 The EFRA Committee accepted Barnes’ recommendation that the Bill should contain statutory duties \[ **C3: 27**\]: ‘Professor Richard Barnes argued for restating the objectives in Clause 1 as duties, suggesting it would “aid decision\-makers by providing a clear set of reference points that must be considered in the exercise of discretionary powers”’ **\[C3, 71\]**. In written evidence to the Public Bills Committee on the 2018 Fisheries Bill, Barnes called for a strengthening of the fisheries objectives and a greater focus on promoting public benefits **\[C11\]**. Government introduced a revised Fisheries Bill that restated these objectives as duties, thus strengthening the environmental credentials of the Bill and, ultimately the Fisheries Act, thereby providing a mechanism to hold decision\-makers to account for the mismanagement of fisheries. It also included a new ‘national benefits objective’ **\[C12: clauses 1\(8\) and 6\-11\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Enabling Parliamentary scrutiny** 

 The research enabled critical scrutiny of government policy and legislation, by providing and presenting the evidence base to Parliamentary committees to challenge the government policy position. Specifically, the EFRA Committee adopted Barnes’s advice \(underpinned by **\[R6\]**\) that financial support must be linked to the coastal community development and sustainable fishing: 

 ‘… Barnes suggested that the fisheries objectives would be enhanced by “linking the provisions on financial assistance under Clause 28 to the objectives in Clause 1” … to “facilitate an alignment between developmental activities and the operational delivery of sustainable fisheries”’. **\[C: 84\]** This resulted in the recommendation that ‘The Government should also make direct reference to this issue in the Bill by expanding Clause 2 to make specific reference to economic regeneration of coastal communities.’ **\[C3: 90\]** 

 Additionally, the Welsh Assembly CCERA committee accepted Barnes’ advice \(underpinned by **\[R3\]**\) that the Fisheries Bill 2018 requires stronger oversight and should include management duties **\[C6: 44, 59 & Conclusion 7\]**. This resulted in a recommendation to give legislative consent to the Fisheries Bill by the Committee. 

 Furthermore, Barnes’ research enabled the Lords European Union Committee to challenge the government position on the separation of fishing and trade. The Committee juxtaposed Barnes’ comments on the need for access to EU markets for the seafood sector as a whole \(underpinned by **\[R6\]**\) against the Secretary of State for Environment’s position. Lord Teverson, the Chair of the Committee specifically drew upon Barnes’ evidence to challenge the Governments strategy/policy of trying to separate out trade and fisheries issues in the negotiations with the EU **\[C13: pp.5\-6\]**. Barnes continues enable this legislative scrutiny, giving a private briefing to the EFRA Select Committee on key issues facing the UK in post\-Brexit management of fishing, and receiving an invitation to give evidence to the Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union. 

 **\(iii\) Enabling stakeholder participation in legislative processes** 

 The reach of the impact extends to the fishing industry. In his advice to the Welsh Assembly, the Chairman of the New Under Tens Fishermen’s Association \(the industry association representing thousands of inshore fishing vessels\) directly relied upon Barnes calling for stronger controls on Fisheries Statements in the Fisheries Bill: 

 ‘With regard to the Joint Fisheries Statement, a more technical element of the draft Bill, we make no apologies for referring to the wise and erudite comments made by Professor Richard Barnes of Hull University in this respect. \[…\] his written comments … we therefore copy below…’ **\[C5\]** 

 Barnes’ wider influence on the sector was enabled through a keynote address about the legal complications around leaving the CFP \(underpinned by **\[R3 & 6\]**\) to UK fishermen, hosted by the Blue Marine Foundation and the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers in May 2018 and numerous media engagements **\[C10\]**. 

 **\(2\) Changing fisheries management and governance on the high seas** 

 In addition to shaping UK government fisheries policy, Barnes has engaged with key stakeholders to influence policies, procedures and practices in international waters. Through research services to the WWF, Barnes’ research has enabled the WWF to develop strategies and action points that can be used by fisheries management bodies to improve sustainable fishing on the high seas. Barnes, as a consultant and member of a global think tank \(GLoTT\), advised the WWF on how it can leverage change in the practices of high seas tuna fisheries through legal instruments **\[R4 & 6; C7\]**. The GLoTT was part of a larger project on Tuna Fisheries and Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction \(Tuna ABNJ\). The WWF is a lead partner in this ongoing project.  Research by Barnes has been taken up by the WWF and is being used by a network of WWF advisers to inform their work across 11 Regional Fisheries Management Organisations \(RFMO\), where the WWF is working to transform regional fisheries management so that RFMOs take sound policy decisions and adopt practices that help reduce harmful overfishing, illegal fishing and bycatch practices. Barnes’ research **\[R2, R6\]** was used to shape WWF’s position on ‘Bellagio statement’ on ‘rights\-based management’ that led to a multimillion\-dollar World Bank project on incentive\-based change in tuna fisheries. Vishwanie Maharaj, Lead Economist \- Oceans, WWF\-US, states: ‘ *Barnes’ research, particularly his advice on the regulatory limitations of implementing right\-based measures on the high seas, is used by our team, and has been helpful in shaping our policy and approach to advocating reform of fisheries management in the East Pacific Ocean/high seas*’ **\[C8\]**. This has resulted in calls to reduce fleet capacity through rights\-based mechanisms and incentive based tools in the Inter\-American Tropical Tuna Commission where capacity is to reduce from a potential 296,415 m<sup>3</sup> to a target of 158000m<sup>3</sup> **\[C9\]**. An independent evaluation of the Tuna ABNJ project in 2020 states that the number of stocks managed under a harvest strategy \(HS\) or having a HS being developed increased from one to fourteen, while the number of overfished stocks decreased by more than 60%; The percentage of stocks fished at a sustainable level almost doubled, increasing from 43% to 78%.  Although it was impossible to objective determine the precise contribution of the ABNJ Tuna Project, ‘the project efforts undoubtedly have contributed significantly to this outcome’. \[ **C10**\] 

 **\(3\) Summary** 

 Barnes’ research **\[R 1, 2, 3&6\]** has shaped the development of UK fisheries law and policy, and improved its capacity to deliver sustainable management for the public benefit. It continues to influence the way fisheries are managed on the high seas.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Zana Vathi’s research into migration in the Western Balkans and regional patterns of migration has had significant impact on migration management and overall social and child protection policymaking in the Western Balkans region. Throughout several research projects, an evidence base has been developed to inform policy and decision making on key issues including children’s rights in the context of migration and reintegration. The research findings have been adopted by international agencies, cited by leading decision\-making organisations and individuals, and informed policy decisions across the EU. The research has also directly influenced the work of international agencies and practitioners in the region and placed social protection and children’s rights at the heart of the migration and social policy agenda at national, regional, and international levels. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Migration in the Western Balkans has recorded some of the highest relative records worldwide. Western Balkan countries have been listed among countries with highest percentage of emigration \(e.g. Albania, 25%\), including high rates of irregular migration. They are also major senders of refugees to the EU, major recipients of remittances, and more recently, main countries from where most EU returnees originate \(EUROSTAT 2017\). Literature on migration in the Western Balkans at regional level is limited and inconsistent, due to the very dynamic migratory profiles of countries in the region, the differences across the region and the particularities of migratory profiles of different countries, and also due to the lack of systematic data collection. 

 Dr Vathi’s academic research has shed light on some of the least researched aspects of migration in the Western Balkans, such as: child migration, regional migration of the Roma families and street work patterns, and more recently, return migration and reintegration of children and families, including minorities such as the Roma communities. Her research has been multi\-country \(Western Balkan countries\) delineating regional patterns, multi\-sited \(exploring differences within one particular country \(e.g., Albania\)\), cross\-generational and cross\-sectional, involving children, adult migrants, policy makers and practitioners. 

 Alongside commissioned research on the regional migration patterns in the Western Balkans, in 2013 Vathi launched a project on return and reintegration to Albania, titled ‘The Return and \(Re\)integration of Albanian Migration and Their Children to Albania: Implications for Policy\-making’, funded by Edge Hill University. 

#  Migration in the Western Balkans and Return. 

 Vathi’s work has looked at both regional patterns as well as migration from and into specific countries \(e.g. Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia\). Specific aspects of different forms of migration and settlement in Western Balkan countries have been explored; e.g. child migration and child protection policies and systems in Albania **\[RO6\]** and more distinctly, the return process. In this latter strand of her research Vathi’s work has highlighted innovative aspects of migration, such as the psychosocial wellbeing and vulnerability of returnees **\[RO2 and RO5\]**; the positionality of returnees towards the formal and informal social protection actors in the country of origin **\[RO4, 5\]**; regional similarities and differences on social protection and vulnerability of returnees **\[RO5\]** and reintegration from a socio\-cultural and institutional perspective **\[RO1, 2, 5, 6\].** Her key work on the psychosocial wellbeing of return migrants was first published in the format of an article in the reputable journal *Childhood* **\[RO2\].** This paper was also included in the study pack and invited as a lecture for the *Master of Advanced Studies in Children’s Rights \(MCR\)*, University of Geneva, Switzerland, 10 June 2016. The course attracts practitioners or aspiring practitioners from around the world. Following this output, she also edited a volume titled *Return Migration and Psychosocial Wellbeing*: *Discourses, Policy Making and* *Outcomes for Migrants and their Families,* edited by Vathi and Prof Russell King \(U. of Sussex\), for Routledge \(2017\) **\[RO5\].** 

 **Regional patterns of migration and mobilities of minorities \(Roma, Ashkalie and Egyptians\).** Through a project funded by Terre Des Hommes in South Eastern Europe, part of a larger pan\-European Project \(MARIO\), Vathi led the work on Roma Ashkalie Egyptians’ \(RAE\) migration and mobility from Albania, Kosovo, and North Macedonia. RAE migration was a key topic at the time as the decade of Roma \(2005\-15\) was taking place in Europe aiming to address issues of discrimination and marginalisation of this minority at international level. However, seasonal and regional patterns of RAE migration in the Western Balkans remain understudied. In this regard, Vathi’s work **\[RO3\]** looked at circular migration and street work and the child protection issues linked to it. More recently, she was also invited to work on a further research commission for the World Bank on a project that looks at the specificities of return migration of RAE minorities and the response of the Western Balkan countries to the issues of their reintegration **\[RO6\].**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The research has had impact on policy, decision makers and international organisations supporting and managing migration. Vathi has worked with a number of international actors, via directly commissioned research and policy consultation and invited keynotes. The results of these projects have been a series of impacts across the Western Balkans and more broadly across the EU. 

#  Impacts on policy\-oriented research, advocacy and practice at national, regional and EU level 

 The findings and recommendations put forward by Vathi in reports on regional patterns of migration and street work in Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia served as the basis for advocacy by Terre Des Hommes on children and adolescents’ rights in the subregion; new trainings were designed in Albania on the basis of the research’s findings, and the anti\-trafficking authorities in Macedonia considered the possibility of joining the multilateral agreement frameworks outlined above **\[S5\]**. 

 Vathi has delivered training informed by this research to practitioners and service providers. She has acted as a keynote speaker in 2 country policy events \(Kosovo 2017, **S6** and **S3;** North Macedonia 2018 **, S1**\). In the first policy event in Kosovo \(2017\) she was invited to give a keynote speech drawing on research on the inclusion of the returned children in the Kosovan education system, with a focus on the Roma children, in a national stakeholders conference organised by Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit \(German corporation for international development\) GIZ, which brought together representatives of the international organizations, various ministries and INGOs as well as practitioners working at local level. 

 The focus on returnee children in the Western Balkans context is in line with the agendas of major stakeholders working in this field, which aim to train local practitioners as part of their mission in the region. As confirmed by GIZ **\[S6\]**, the recommendations offered from the policy event relating to Vathi’s research, particularly those on the inclusion of child migration in the framework for child protection, facilitation of bilingual schools and other services that recognise children’s double identities and promoting education as a community\-focused system and process, have been very insightful and have stimulated development work to further shape policies and programmes in this area. ‘ *The psychosocial well\-being of children and the challenging process of reintegration in the society and in the educational system were of particular interest for the audience; hence, the major insights given from Dr. Vathi, have contributed to stressing the needs of children….* *Her recommendations on good practices, particularly those on the inclusion of child migration in the framework for child protection, facilitation of bilingual schools and other services that recognise children’s double identities and promoting education as a community\-focused system and process have been very insightful and have stimulated some debate and consideration to further pursue and accommodate these activities within the framework of assistance to these categories.’. GIZ Programme Manager **\[S6\]**.* 

 Vathi was also subsequently invited to speak in a policy event organised by the European Policy Institute \(EPI\) in Skopje, North Macedonia in April 2018 on Roma migration and reintegration after the visa liberalisation. The event prompted the EPI to incorporate the findings into the new Strategy for Reintegration to be used to underpin the reintegration of returning citizens, **\[S1\].** *‘The conference….discussion and the presentation gave food for thought to the representatives of the institutions in the audience, especially those coming from the three key institutions: MLSP, MOI, MFA. Most importantly Dr Vathi’s valuable input given during the conference did not only reach the representatives in the audience but will also be used to upgrade the findings which will be further disseminated to the highest political level, namely the Prime Minister’ Executive Director of the European Institute of Skopje* **\[S8\]** 

 Further work on the reintegration of returned children to Albania was conducted by Terre des Hommes on the basis of Vathi’s recommendation outlined in a report she was commissioned to write in 2016, which led to the appointment of additional social workers in regional and municipality offices in Albania linked to her recommendation for the focus to shift onto the local service level **\[S11\].** 

 The policy events in Albania \(2015\) and Kosovo \(2017\) where Vathi presented as a keynote speaker were covered by the national medias, raising awareness among members of the public. As part of her engagement in GIZ’s work in Kosovo, in November 2017 Vathi gave an interview for the national TV channel in Kosovo RTK Morning Show on the issue of reintegration into schools of returned children **.** The policy event organised by GIZ was covered by seven different media pieces in Kosovo **.** *‘The public event was widely quoted in several newspapers. Moreover, feedback from public institutions and civil society organizations showed that the speech helped to increase the awareness on the relevance and the severity of the issues. Among other things it was reinstated that it is of crucial importance that there is ongoing cross\-sector collaboration between central and local level as well as civil society in achieving the successful integration of returnee children and ethnic minorities.'  Head of component on Educational Inclusion of Returnees and Ethnic Minorities, GIZ, **\[S6\]** 

#  Impacts on the policy framework and policymaking at national, regional and EU level 

 Vathi’s academic work and consultancy research have had significant impact on migration management and overall social and child protection policymaking in the Western Balkans region and at international level. Her report on transnational migration and street work in Albania and Kosovo \(Vathi 2014\) was cited in the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in Albania, second evaluation round adopted on 11 March 2016. **\[S11\]** The same work led to concrete policy outcomes such as a *multilateral treaty and subsequent Standard Operating Procedures that were signed and ratified by three countries in the region \(Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo\).* This research and advocacy changed the way the EU institutions and governments in the region approach the issue of European migration of children and youth and also impacted on the situation of children at national level. *A new law on child protection in Kosovo* was adopted, taking into account the findings and recommendations outlined in her research.  Terre des Hommes, an international humanitarian children’s rights organisation, utilised the research findings of the research in Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia **\[RO3\]** to lobby the European institutions on these issues. Among the different initiatives that Terre des Hommes launched informed by Vathi’s research, 2 international conferences at the European Economic and Social Committee in 2015 and in TDHIF headquarters in 2016 have led to the changes in policy and practice within the European Commission: *‘More importantly, we utilised the research findings to lobby the European Institutions on these issues. Among the different initiatives that we launched and which were informed by the research conducted by Dr Vathi, 2 international conferences at the European Economic and Social Committee in 2015 and in TDHIF headquarters in 2016 led to the inclusion of the specific needs of European migrant children in the European Commission’s work agenda as well as the opening of EU funding instruments to EU migrant children.’ Regional Child Rights Advisor – Europe Terre des Hommes* **\[S5\].** 

 A more recent consultancy report \(Vathi and Zajmi 2017\) is starting to affect policy making in the fields of child migration and social protection. According to Terre des Hommes \(2017\): *‘The study can serve as a basis for further improvements to the legal, policy and institutional framework concerning migration management, which should include the provision of services for those vulnerable groups who take difficult journeys in the hope of finding a better life’* **\[S9\]**. 

 In particular, the focus on psychosocial wellbeing in the context of return appears to be an innovative approach, which is attracting a significant interest from policymakers. The focus in the context of return migration has, for a long time, been on the *sustainability of returns*, and very explicitly so in the context of Western Balkans. However, the EU Commission and major stakeholders, such as the World Bank, are starting to shift the attention onto a more individualised needs\-based approach and look at the *sustainability of reintegration*, considering the vulnerabilities of returnees. 

 Vathi’s research on this topic **\[RO1, 2, 4, 5\]** was at the basis of an invitation to work as an international expert on the project ‘Supporting the Effective Reintegration of Roma Returnees In The Western Balkans’ commissioned by the EU Commission and managed by the World Bank. In 2017 the European Commission’s \(EC\) Directorate General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations \(DG NEAR\) approached the World Bank to develop an evidence base and policy advice for supporting the effective reintegration of Roma returnees in the Western Balkans. The European Commission works closely with Western Balkan countries under the Instrument for Pre\-Accession Assistance \(IPA – the instrument that guides the process of EU membership for the countries of the Western Balkans\) to support Roma inclusion programs at the national, regional and municipal levels. The objective of this project, therefore, is *to identify relevant policy responses and implementation pathways for the effective reintegration of returnees in the Western Balkans – with a particular focus on Roma returnees \- based on the evidence of reintegration experiences* **\[S7\].** 

 The project started in Dec 2017 and its findings have influenced the EU agenda for the EU enlargement in the Western Balkans. Participants of the workshop included representatives of DG NEAR of the European Commission, World Bank senior managers and advisors, academics and international research consultants. The research Dr Vathi has undertaken has been invaluable in different stages of this project, starting with her review of the key issues related to migration in the Western Balkans and the situation of the Roma, which then fed into the World Bank’s overall survey and other work in the region. The project integrated an inception workshop in Vienna **\[S2\]** where Vathi presented on the topic of vulnerabilities of returnees in the Western Balkans region. Furthermore, Dr Vathi’s input in the methodology of the project ensured that a more robust data set was generated from World Bank’s survey with Roma and non\-Roma returnees in 6 Western Balkan countries. **\[S7\]** 

 Based on this material, Dr Vathi produced a research report **\[RO6\],** which the World Bank relied on to prepare policy papers containing recommendations to the European Commission/DG Near on policy responses and implementation pathways for the reintegration of the Roma in the Balkans. *‘Dr Vathi’s research has directly informed a number of recommendations, which have been considered for further action by EC DG Near and form a key part of its policy on re\-integration in the region and inevitably affect the implementation of the Instrument for Pre\-Accession Assistance \(IPA\) – the foundation document that regulates Western Balkan countries’ accession in the EU. Therefore, the outcomes of this research have a broad and significant bearing on the region’s present and future status and relations with the EU, alongside the impact on migrants, national policy makers and international organizations in the Western Balkans. The recommendations will also help inform the technical assistance to Western Balkans by preparing the six countries for their accession negotiations.’* *Senior Policy Advisor, World Bank Group, Washington DC* **\[S7\]**. Subsequently the European Commission have formally incorporated the research evidence and recommendations from the World Bank report into an instrument for pre\-accession assistance \(IPA\) for the Western Balkans. Specifically, component 2 *‘enhance the ability of Western Balkan’s authorities at central and local level to implement effective reintegration policies and respond effectively to the needs of vulnerable returnees…*’ is underpinned by Vathi’s recommendations within the report **\[S13\]**. 

 Based on her expertise in migration and integration, Vathi was invited to co\-author a chapter on migrants' integration in the United Nations World Migration Report 2020. The World Migration Report is published every two years; it is a key resource for academics and practitioners globally, it is digitally published and easily accessible and widely used by practitioners, policy makers and journalists worldwide.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Computer simulation models based directly on University of Southampton research are now in routine use by the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health for planning the recruitment and training of health professionals. As a direct result of the first model, for dental surgeons, over 1.5 million people with no previous access to state\-funded care are now able to visit a dentist once a year. There has been a significant improvement in population oral health and the number of unemployed qualified dentists has fallen from over 250 in 2010 to zero today. Following the success of this model, in 2016 the Ministry established a Human Resources Division to support its 125,000\-strong workforce, and since 2018 simulation models are being used to plan postgraduate medical training in 56 specialties.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Operational research \(OR\) modelling to improve decision\-making in healthcare has been a research strength at Southampton since the 1980s. Professor Sally Brailsford has been involved in, and since 2000 has led, a number of research projects in this area, with a variety of funders including EPSRC, NIHR, various NHS organisations and The Health Foundation. Close collaboration with healthcare organisations and clinical stakeholders is a major feature of her research \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\].  She has also developed methods \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\] for including human behaviour in simulation models, using concepts from health psychology, for healthcare applications where it is important to recognise that the modelled “entities” are actually human beings, often in stressful situations, who do not always behave rationally. 

 Brailsford is recognised internationally as an expert in health OR. From 2010\-19 she was Coordinator of the EURO Working Group in OR Applied to Health Services \(ORAHS\), and she was a founder Editor\-in\-Chief of the UK OR Society’s journal *Health Systems* \(2012\-19\). She is the only three\-time winner of the UK OR Society’s Goodeve Medal, awarded annually for the best paper published in the *Journal of the OR Society*. All three of these papers \(\[ **3.1**\], \[ **3.2**\] and \[ **3.6**\]\) describe real\-world applications of system dynamics modelling to improve decision\-making in healthcare. Since 2010 her research interests have included investigating the factors that determine the take\-up \(or the lack of it\) of OR modelling for routine decision support within the NHS.  She has led two research projects in this area: one in 2010\-11 funded by the NHS Institute for Innovation & Improvement \[ **3.5**\], and one in 2018\-19 funded by the Health Foundation. Key findings from the earlier research, summarised in \[ **3.5**\], include the need for the model to address a business\-critical problem, the importance of senior management engagement, the need for models to take account of human behaviour, and the need for a clinical “modelling champion” within the NHS organisation. Other challenges include data\-related problems, political issues, and constant organisational change; clinical modelling champions rarely stay in the same role for long. 

 In 2007 Dileep De Silva, a qualified dentist working as an administrator in the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health, discovered Brailsford’s research through an internet search and immediately saw its relevance for Sri Lanka. Like the UK, Sri Lanka has a publicly funded state health service which also includes dental care. As a low\-middle income developing country, only a tiny number of people are able to afford private dental treatment and the vast majority of people are totally dependent on state\-funded care. However, by 2007 nearly two decades of poor coordination between the country’s Ministries of Health and Higher Education had resulted in over 250 qualified dentists being unable to find employment due to a lack of government\-funded posts, despite very low levels of population oral health and a desperate need for dental care, especially in rural areas. Since the early 1990s increasing numbers of new graduates – of whom De Silva was one – either worked in non\-clinical roles, took up short\-term locum posts, or travelled overseas for specialist dental training \(at government expense\). Instead of clinical training, De Silva decided to study for a PhD in OR at Southampton under Brailsford’s supervision. They developed a simulation model that used several findings from her previous research: the need for clinician engagement, the importance of including human behaviour, and ways to facilitate and support the clinical champion role to engage with decision\-makers. In 2010 he presented this model at a Sri Lankan Government Cabinet meeting and demonstrated the impact of different policy options. As a result, the Ministry of Higher Education agreed to fix the intake of dentistry students for ten years and the Ministry of Health created 400 additional government\-funded posts over four years \(2011\-14\). The journal article \[ **3.6**\] describing the model and its early impact won Brailsford’s third Goodeve Medal.

###  4. Details of the impact

The most significant impact of this research since 2014 has been on the oral health of the Sri Lankan population. The Sri Lanka National Oral Health Survey is carried out every 10\-12 years and provides a comprehensive evaluation of dental care provision and population oral health status. The most recent survey \[ **5.1**\] was conducted in 2015\-16 and published in 2018. Of course, many factors contributed to the improvements seen in this latest survey, but the benefits arising directly from an increase in dental service provision, especially in rural areas, were due to the model \[ **5.2** \- **5.4**\]. The Chief Dental Officer in the Ministry of Health stated: ‘ *Having implemented the System Dynamics model findings; by 2014/2015, the entire waiting list for employment of dental surgeons was cleared. Moreover newly graduating dental surgeons' awaiting time for employment was brought down to 1\-2 months. With the employment of new graduates, more than 2 million new patient visits were recorded from the entire country, mainly from the rural areas. Further it helped this ministry to launch new National programs in Dental Public Health, such as ""Save molar program"" and ""Pregnant mothers program’* \[ **5.3**\]. The Past President of the Sri Lanka Dental Association stated: ‘ *This has helped to improve the accessibility of dental services in the country, especially in the rural areas and hence the dental health status of the Sri Lankans, as shown by latest National Oral Health Survey*’ \[ **5.4**\]. 

 The 2015\-16 national survey \[ **5.1**\] includes data from the previous survey, undertaken in 2002\-03, which reported a significant lack of dental care, especially in rural regions. Nationally, in 2002\-03 there were only 765 practising dental surgeons and 312 government clinics for a population of around 20 million; less than 10% of the population regularly visited a dentist; over 90% of adults had gum disease; and 51% of the 1.8 million dental visits per year were for extractions \[ **5.1**\].  By 2015 service provision had increased substantially. The numbers of dental surgeons and government clinics had doubled since 2002\-03, rising to 1,535 and 712 respectively. The 2015\-16 report \[ **5.1**\] states that “ *When compared to the previous National Oral Health Surveys, there has been a reduction in the oral disease burden and an improvement in oral health habits of the Sri Lankan population, regardless of age, sex, ethnic and sector variations”* \(p61\) and “.. *there has been an improvement in dental service utilization patterns”* \(p59\).  The increase in regular attendance, seen across all age groups, but particularly striking for 15\-year\-olds, is shown in Table 1. 

 **Table 1. Percentage of people who visit a dentist at least once a year \[source: 5.1\]** 

| **Age** | **2002\-03** | **2015\-16** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | 43.1 | 59.6 |
| 15 | 13.7 | 31.4 |
| 35\-44 | 25.6 | 30.9 |
| 65\-74 | 12.6 | 18.4 |

 The 2015\-16 survey found that around 40% of the population, approximately 8,000,000 people, now visit a state dentist annually and over 65% of people in both urban and rural areas live within 5km of a government dental clinic \[ **5.1**\]. The overall percentage of visits for extractions, an indicator of poor general oral hygiene and lack of regular preventive dental care, had fallen from 51% to 33%. Table 2 summarises the improvements in population oral health, which were seen across all age groups. The greatest improvements are seen in the younger age groups; for people aged 65 and above, the effects of decades of poor dental care cannot be entirely reversed. 

 **Table 2. Comparison in oral health indicators \[source: 5.1\]** 

| **Indicator** | **Age** | **2002\-03** | **2015\-16** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mean no. of teeth present | 12 | 25.7 | 26.1 |
|| 15 | 27.8 | 27.9 |
|| 35\-44 | 26.4 | 27.5 |
|| 65\-74 | 12.2 | 15.3 |
| % prevalence of dental caries | 12 | 40.0 | 30.4 |
|| 15 | 52.2 | 41.5 |
|| 35\-44 | 89.8 | 92.5\* |
|| 65\-74 | 71.1 | 98.3\* |
| % lacking all their natural teeth | 35\-44 | 0.1 | 0 |
|| 65\-74 | 21.8 | 11.3 |
| % with gum disease | 12 | 72.8 | 44.7 |
|| 15 | 96.8 | 51.9 |
|| 35\-44 | 89.9 | 77.9 |
|| 65\-74 | 98.1 | 94.4 |

 \* increase over 2002\-03 due to greater proportion of people retaining their natural teeth 

 A second, more general, impact has been on the Ministry of Health itself. The Sri Lankan Ministry of Health, Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine has been in existence for 120 years. In 2013 it catered for 54 million outpatient visits and 6 million inpatient stays per annum \[ **5.5**\]. It employs over 125,000 staff whose salaries constitute over 50% of its total budget. Nevertheless, prior to 2017, the Ministry had no Human Resources Division. Sources \[ **5.5**\- **5.8**\] confirm that the creation of a new HR Division, headed by De Silva and with a staff of 10, was a direct consequence of the impact of the dentists model, and a recognition by the Sri Lankan Government that planning the future healthcare workforce is a complex task, requiring detailed analysis, often over very long timescales given the length of time it takes to train doctors and dentists. The Minister of Health stated: *“\[We\] recognize the importance and relevance of HR strategy objectives and basic principles of HR policy, planning and development*” \[ **5.5**\]. 

 Among the things De Silva was asked to do was to extend the dentist model to 2030 and to develop models for advanced medical training up to 2025 \[ **5.9**\]. The Director General for Health Services at the Ministry of Health confirmed in November 2017 that the recommendations \(increasing the intake of the pre\-MD training programme for surgical specialties, but reducing it for medical and paediatric specialties\) had been “… *discussed with all Professional Colleges and Associations”* and had then been accepted by the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine at the University of Colombo and would be implemented across all 56 specialties. He said “ *This is the first time such a scientific and innovative methodology was developed in this Ministry, shifting Health Human Resources Planning of the country to an advance and scientific platform*” \[ **5.9**\]. It is of course far too early to observe any direct impact on population health from this more recent modelling work, since the changes only came into force for the 2018\-19 academic year. However, the creation of this new HR Division is evidence of the societal impact of Brailsford’s research. 

 Image source: \[ **5.1**\], p14 

The third impact was on dentists themselves: their career prospects, their job satisfaction and their general wellbeing. This was evaluated in a survey \[ **5.10**\], conducted by De Silva in summer 2019, of the 455 dentists \(roughly one third of the total dental surgeon workforce at the time\) who had graduated since the implementation in 2011 of the original model recommendations \(response rate  51%\). It takes at least six months to obtain Medical Council registration and complete all the necessary administrative processes, but nevertheless 87% of respondents had obtained government employment within a year of graduation, compared with the former average wait of over 40 months. 96% of respondents were happy or very happy that unlike their predecessors, they were able to start their clinical careers immediately, remain in Sri Lanka and do the job they had been trained to do. One respondent commented “ *As an undergraduate at the Faculty of Dental Sciences University of Peradeniya, it was frustrating to see our seniors wasting around 3 years doing nothing but few locum work while awaiting for state sector jobs. Unemployment of dental surgeons was a big headache for us”* and another said “ *I am so happy to receive Government employment within a short period from Graduation. This helped me to plan my professional career as well as family matters. I consider myself very lucky to receive government employment without waiting 2\-3 years for permanent employment*” \[ **5.10**\]. 

 91% of respondents reported a job satisfaction score of at least 7 on a scale of 1\-10, where 10 is high.  The survey also found that 78% of respondents had been posted to rural areas, 17% to semi\-urban and 5% to urban areas.  This finding was particularly important given the low level of rural provision in the past.  29% of respondents regularly saw between 1\-10 patients per day, 64% saw 11\-25 patients per day and 7% saw 26\-40 patients per day. Scaling these figures up to include all 455 newly qualified dentists, using the mid\-point of each range, gives roughly additional 1,560,000 patient visits per annum, of which 1,250,000 are in rural areas \[ **5.10**\]. Taken in combination with the findings reported in \[ **5.1**\] and the Ministry’s figure of 2 million new visits by 2014/15 \[ **5.3**\], this yields a  conservative estimate of 1.5 million people with no previous access to state\-funded care who are now able to visit a dentist once a year.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken by Lab4Living has developed products that have **enhanced dignity and quality of life for individuals with long\-term conditions**. The Head\-Up neck orthosis has **delivered** **‘life\-changing’ improvements for people living with Motor\-Neurone Disease** \(MND\) and is now **in use at 25 NHS Trusts in the UK and available worldwide**.  Lab4Living’s Support4All garment has i **mproved modesty and dignity for women undergoing treatment for breast cancer** whilst **increasing the accuracy of radiotherapy** procedures. 

 The research\-informed product Life Café has **enabled people to engage in open conversations about the care of the dying**. Life Cafés have been **adopted by terminal cancer charity, Marie Curie, for their national programme** of work on enhancing end of life care. Lab4Living’s Journeying through Dementia intervention has **shaped national policy and provision of care for people living with dementia** across Scotland and Wales.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Medicine is a material science and is enacted through instruments, objects, furniture and products. Dominant medical discourses can neglect to understand this materiality and the meaning of these products in the context of patients’ lives. This disconnect is most apparent during major health transitions, for instance in the diagnosis of chronic conditions such as dementia or in the experience of invasive treatments such as those for cancer. 

 A programme of funded research \(British Council, NIHR i4i, Marie Curie, NES, Alliance Scotland\) has used design methodologies to understand the challenges that individuals experiencing these transitions face and developed informed responses through the creation of products and tools that challenge existing medical discourses, placing emphasis on dignity and quality of life. Central to this research has been overarching methodological principles that bring together diverse communities of stakeholders from the outset, foregrounding the experiences of the end\-users and a thinking\-through\-things methodology \( **R1**\) drawing on exhibition and collective making as knowing. In doing so, an overly dominant discourse and reliance on written and verbal methods of data collection is challenged and knowledge is situated within and across the communities where it is generated. \( **R2**\) 

 A methodology centred on collective making creates the right conditions for research knowledge to be mobilised by addressing issues relating to stakeholder relationships and enabling the discovery, sharing and blending of different forms of knowledge from different perspectives.  This can be applied across different contexts, enabling stakeholders from diverse methodological paradigms in design and health to learn about the practical implications of knowledge use and to collectively create actionable products \( **R2**\). 

 Reed and Langley led a series of collaborative workshops with neurologists clinicians, industry, people with MND and their carers and identified a need to increase usage of traditional neck orthoses by people living with MND \( **R3**\). Research revealed a number of factors leading to non\-use including restrictiveness, levels of support and stigma. Funding through the NIHR i4i programme was secured with partners and through an iterative practice\-led method of co\-designing and testing with the research partners led to the design of a new customisable collar named **Head\-Up** \( **R3**\). 

 A similar collaborative methodology was adopted by Reed et al. for the research programme **Support for All**, \( **R4**\) which sought to improve the experience of woman undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer. Research focused on an area of unmet need \- the development of a bra providing a more dignified, stabilising and positioning garment for use during post\-operative breast cancer radiotherapy. \( **R4**\). 

 Medical advancements have resulted in an extended ‘end of life’ where people live with and die from multimorbidities that has placed more pressure on palliative care services. In 2017 cancer charity Marie Curie commissioned a programme of research to inform the development of new models of end of life\-care. 141 older people were recruited from community and third sector organisations to participate in the study which utilised a thinking through things methodology named exhibition in a box \( **R1**\). A key finding of the research was that people did not have the opportunity to talk about what was important to them and how they gave and received care \( **R5**\). It was found that the curated creative activities named **Life Café**, developed as a methodology through collective making within the research, offered a vehicle through which individuals could articulate the values, meanings and motivations that individuals regarded as a priority \( **R5**\). 

 Dementia impacts on the quality of life of 850,000 individuals in the UK. Craig’s \(2017\) enquiry \( **R6**\) brought together people living with dementia and their families to gain insight into what would promote wellbeing following diagnosis. This led to the co\-designed intervention **Journeying through Dementia**, equipping individuals with the skills required to redesign their life\-style to accommodate the challenges that living with dementia brings. This research then brought together policy makers and lead clinicians to understand what was required to operationalise the intervention across health services and collectively co\-create tools with them \( **R6**\). 

 These outputs form part of Lab4Living’s portfolio of research that supported the success in gaining the Expanding Excellence in England \( **E3**\) Award from Research England  in 2019. As one of only 13 recipients nationally, the award was a recognition of the quality of the research undertaken. This quality has been endorsed through a number of awards \(ROMPA Quality of Life Award 2010, Innovations Award, 2010\). Research Councils cite Lab4Living research as examples of excellence in applied research \(e.g. NIHR 2018\) and methodologies as best practice in co\-design \(NIHR INVOLVE 2019\). 

 Lab4Living has established wide reaching pathways to the dissemination of research in this field. These mechanisms include \(but are not limited to\) the International Design4Health conference, which attracts world leading design and healthcare researchers the Design for Health Journal and the Design4Health Global Network.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Products developed by Lab4Living have improved quality of life and wellbeing for individuals living with MND, cancer and dementia, promoting dignity and independence. Lab4Living’s methodology, which strategically engages stakeholders throughout research programmes, has established pathways to impact and has led to shaping government policy, the commissioning of interventions within health and in the extension of commercial markets. 

 **Head\-Up:** Head Up was selected as one of four case studies from a total of 170 funded projects for a report by RAND on the NIHR Invention for innovation \(i4i\) programme to evaluate outputs and impacts emerging from the programme. The report identified that common enablers included the multidisciplinary skill mix of the Lab4Living team as well as consultation and access to patients \(users\) and proactive efforts to understand the regulatory landscape. Insights generated through the Head\-Up research \( **R3**\) resulted in a product distinct from any existing orthosis \( **E1**\) offering support whilst also providing freedom of movement. Head\-Up has enabled ongoing participation in meaningful activity including, driving, work and interacting with others. Patients have described the ‘life changing’ impact the collar has had on their **quality of life** \( **E1**\) and carers also affirmed benefits on their own **wellbeing**. 

 *I could not contemplate life without my husband having the collar* \(UK customer, **E1**\) 

 *‘Her life has been transformed by the use of the head collar. She is able to sit more upright…it has been life enhancing in that she can sit in her wheelchair and spend more time outdoors’* \(French carer, **E2**\) 

 Head\-Up wearers have noted the non\-stigmatising appearance of the collar  which promotes **dignity** as ‘ *it looks like a piece of clothing rather than a medical device*’ \( **E1**\) and its unique design allows it to be customised to the exact needs of the individual so that as their needs change the collar can provide additional support with demonstrable outcomes. In a study of 140 patients Head Up scored significantly better \(p<0.005\) than previous collars used by patients in terms of satisfaction, level of support offered, residual head movement possible, appearance, and lack of interference with eating and drinking. **Patient health outcomes have been improved**. In a trial of 100 patients in 10 sites across the UK, key **functional improvements** were seen and Head Up was found to be more effective than previous collars in enabling patients to eat, drink and swallow \( **E3**\). Correspondingly, care practices have changed and by 2018 the collar was **offered by 25 hospital trusts in the UK** \( **E4**\). 

 Head\-Up has been licenced to, and manufactured by leading medical device supplier, Talarmade. This has opened up a **new market** for the company \[Text removed for publication\]. Patents have been granted in the UK and the USA. Head\-up is CE marked, complies with US standards and has been granted the ‘L0170’ code \(pre\-requisite for clinical prescription in US\) \( **E2**\). Head\-Up is currently distributed across all mainland EU countries, Nordic countries, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. It has three distributors in the US including the two largest in the sector \( **E5**\). 

 **Support4All:** Research \( **R4**\) led to the design of the Support4All garment \(S4A\) which stabilizes and positions the breast during radiotherapy treatment. This has improved the **accuracy** of the procedure, preserved the **dignity** of the patient, who is not required to fully undress or undergo as many permanent tattoos to guide treatment. A randomised feasibility trial involving 50 patients showed improvement in mean ipsilateral lung breast irradiation dose when using the garment \( **E6**\). User experience was improved with evidence of increased **patient wellbeing**, **modesty**, **dignity** and **empowerment** \( **E6**\). The research was named in the top 100 university discoveries \( **E7**\). 

 ‘ *This is exciting and innovative research with the potential to improve both the accuracy and experience of radiotherapy*.’ \(Nicola Blackwood, Public Health Minister\) 

 A **patent** for S4A has been granted with national validations in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, GB, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden. A US patent application is pending, and **licencing** discussions are underway with  [www.macromedics.com](http://www.macromedics.com/) \( **E5**\). 

 **Life Café:** The outcome of the Design to Care research programme \( **R5**\), the Life Café is a product comprising a set of curated creative activities which has enabled individuals to engage in conversation about end of life and, where appropriate, has informed treatment planning. Over 200 Life Cafes have been purchased by the 3rd sector terminal cancer charity, Marie Curie, who have **adopted the product** to support a national programme of work to promote **wellbeing** by engendering conversations about end of life care: 

 *‘Lab4Living’s Life Cafes stood out as a truly innovative method of community consultation and development. The Life Cafes proved much more useful than interviews, because we heard answers to questions that had not necessarily occurred to us, as service deliverers’* \(Clinical Director, Marie Curie, **E10**\) 

 Since 2018, over 50 Life Cafés have been held in communities, care homes, hospitals and hospices where it has supported conversations about care requirements promoting **dignity** and **quality of life** in the context of care. \( **E10**\) A study evaluating the Life Café on a national scale has been delayed due to COVID\-19, however data collected to date shows that **participants value the Life Café** in promoting conversation and in sharing hopes and fears around the taboo subject of death **promoting mental wellbeing**\( **E8**, **E10**\): 

 ‘ *It’s been wonderful to communicate with people on this level and think about the moments that are not very far for some of us…what would we like when we’re in that position*’, \(Life Café participant, **E8**\) 

 *‘Wherever Life Cafes are held, they generate a tremendous amount of enthusiasm; also a kind of relief that it is possible to be open, spontaneous and creative about such a difficult subject as the death of ourselves, and those we love*’, \(Clinical Director, Marie Curie, **E10**\) 

 In Higher Education settings, including in Sheffield and Lincoln, it has been recognised as a ‘powerful and innovative tool … to cultivate significant connection and conversation’ around end of life care for students of Occupational Therapy. 

 **Journeying through dementia:** The *Journeying through Dementia* programme has been **a key component in the delivery of the dementia strategy for Allied Health Professionals \(AHP\) in Scotland.** The programme has **been adopted by Alzheimer Scotland**. It has also formed the basis of a Royal College of Occupational Therapists **AHP career Fellowship Scheme** \( **E9**\). *Journeying through Dementia* is cited as **a central element of the AHP Scottish policy**, *Connecting People, Connecting Support* \( **E9**\) and, as part of a national roll\-out, has been **successfully implemented by health services** in Fife and Aberdeenshire. AHP consultant, and lead for Policy Research in Scotland, has secured Alliance self\-management funding for roll out across a further 7 Boards in Scotland. She reports that: 

 ‘ *Data captured following its implementation across Fife and Aberdeenshire showed that **71% of participants reported improved quality of life as measured using QoL\-AD.** People with **dementia described feeling more confident and more able to engage in meaningful activities**’.   \( **E9, E10**\) 

 The original programme developed by Craig has been the focus of an RCT in England \(Mountain et al 2015\) involving 480 people living with dementia and 50 staff and is now **part of the** **West Wales dementia wellbeing pathway** \( **E9,E10**\). The focus on individuals at an early point of their dementia journey was **a complete departure from existing approaches to practice** and one which they embraced \( [https://youtu.be/RtooHE3hNYk](https://youtu.be/RtooHE3hNYk)\). Facilitators using the resource reported ‘ **increased confidence, self\-efficacy and engagement in new and previous activities, leading to increased social contact’* for their patients \( **E9**\). Reflecting on the adoption of *Journeying through Dementia*, an occupational therapist in West Wales noted that the programme ‘ *enables patients to face the future with hope that life can be lived well. It aligns with our occupational therapy philosophy, looking for strengths, concentrating on the person and what is important for them and the importance of occupation in all our lives’* \( **E9**\). 

 Materials from programme are hosted on the web\-platform *Connecting People, Connecting Support* which has been **accessed over 56,000 times** in the ten months since it was established. Alzheimer Scotland reported that ‘ *People with dementia and their families have described this as a life\-line*’ \( **E10**\). The materials are cited in the NHS England \(2020\) response to COVID\-19 and endorsed by the Royal College of Occupational Therapists \( **E9,E10**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professors Dasgupta and Coyle, Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team at Cambridge lead a global movement looking beyond gross domestic product \(GDP\) to determine how an economy can prosper sustainably, without sacrificing the natural environment or the future health and wellbeing of its people. Their Inclusive Wealth Framework, developed by Dasgupta in the early 2000’s, provides the theoretical foundation for the practical calculation of sustainable development indicators seen in the United Nations’ \(UN’s\) Inclusive Wealth reports \(2012, 2014, 2018\). It underpins India’s Green National Accounts \(2018 onwards\) that seek to reshape government decision\-making for a ‘better environment, better tomorrow’. Their research has enabled the UN statistics division to account for changes in ecosystems such as air purification, with a direct effect on human health. Their social capital metric supports the Industrial Strategy Council \(2019 onwards\) in evaluating how policy and economic change affect public trust.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 GDP growth has been the overarching goal of economic policy for over 70 years. Whilst material gains have been substantial, they have been accompanied by unprecedented environmental and social change, the consequences of which threaten to wipe out a century of gains. It is a fact widely acknowledged that GDP is a useful, but insufficient measure of economic prosperity. Research by Professors Dasgupta and Coyle, Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team at Cambridge provides a pathway for local and national governments, and international institutions, to move beyond GDP and adopt new frameworks that emphasise a society’s wealth and wellbeing \(rather than its income\) and to develop new measures that account for “missing” capital stocks, in particular natural and social capital. 

 Professor Dasgupta’s welfare economics research on Inclusive \(also called Comprehensive\) Wealth from the early 2000’s **\[R1, R2\]** provides the theoretical foundation for placing human wellbeing, and natural, social, and human capital at the centre of economic statistics. His research at Cambridge shows why the most relevant welfare metric should be wealth and not income, and why the wealth measure must be inclusive and capture not only reproducible and human capital but also natural capital, health improvements and technological change. Inclusive wealth can be measured as a linear index of the economy’s capital stocks. A key theoretical result **\[R2\]** is that changes in Inclusive Wealth have direct consequences for welfare and sustainability. The theory provides a practical wealth management rule for delivering sustainability: Inclusive Wealth must be non\-declining for intertemporal social welfare to be preserved over time. This Inclusive Wealth Framework provides the conceptual cornerstone for the development of new measurement frameworks that can guide policy, as demonstrated in Dasgupta’s 2012 paper **\[R3\]**. The framework not only demonstrates what should be measured from a welfare theoretical point of view, but it offers general guidance on how the theory can be translated into practical metrics for guiding policy and measuring sustainability. 

 Professor Coyle’s research since 2018 at Cambridge **\[R4; R5\]** translates the theory **\[R2; R3\]** into directly applicable policy guidance. Under her leadership, the Wealth Economy team at Cambridge has shown the impact of natural capital mismanagement, and how these impacts can be valued and reflected in new official statistical standards, using research commissioned by the UK Government and the United Nations \(UN\). **\[R6\]** places Dr Agarwala’s 2019 framework within the nexus of food\-water\-governance, showing how the wealth approach can generate real\-world agricultural management improvements. **\[R7; R8\]** form part of the Cambridge Wealth Economy team’s contributions to the development of the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounts \(SEEA\). Dr Agarwala demonstrates **\[R8\]** how the SEEA can be used by Finance Ministries and Central Banks for direct integration with the standard macroeconomic models in use by national governments around the world and **\[R7\]** shows how air filtration ecosystem services can be integrated into the SEEA. Professor Coyle outlines **\[R4; R5\]** how GDP\-oriented measures increase inequality, and how changing HM Treasury rules on Cost\-Benefit valuation can lead to greater investment in those who are ‘left\-behind’ to improve human wellbeing and reduce inequality. This research shows how tangible measures of trust and social capital can be used to evaluate policy and help explain the ‘productivity puzzle’ facing many developed economies.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Professors Dasgupta and Coyle, Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team at Cambridge lead a global revolution in thinking about Inclusive Wealth which has a profound effect on policy making across the world. The impact of the research is evidenced by the widespread adoption by policymakers of the frameworks they developed to conceptualize and to measure Inclusive Wealth. By the end of the REF period, at least 69 countries had implemented the United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting \(SEEA\), and a further 22 were planning to do so **\[S1\]**. Adoption of Inclusive Wealth measures help governments to avoid short\-term policy biases and to promote sustainable development. 

 *‘Professor Dasgupta’s research provided the economic theory underlying the landmark UN Inclusive Wealth Reports* \[2012, 2014 and 2018\] *for which he served as Chief Scientific Advisor.’* **\[S2\]**. His Inclusive Wealth Framework **\[R2, R3\]** provides the theoretical foundation for the practical calculation of sustainable development indicators and is replicated in the foreword to the ‘Inclusive Wealth Report’ 2018 **\[S3**, pp V\-X \(Roman\) **\]**. These reports estimate Inclusive Wealth, including human and natural capital, across the world. They demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate a country’s progress towards achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The Chief Environmental Economist at the Ecosystems Division of the UN Environment Programme states that *“We are now better able to measure the stock of each of these capitals, are developing official statistical standards for countries to report changes in wealth, and will continue to use the wealth framework in pursuit of our mission and in delivering the 2030 Agenda”* **\[S2\]** and the Chief of the Environmental\-Economic Accounts Division says that “ *the development of natural capital accounts is closely linked to the theory of Inclusive Wealth developed by Professor Dasgupta.*” **\[S4\]**. 

 Dr Agarwala has worked with the UN Statistics Division \(UNSD\) since 2019 to develop a process to value air filtration ecosystem services within the United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting – Experimental Ecosystem Accounts \(SEEA\-EEA\), paving the way for the framework to be adopted as a statistical standard in 2021 **\[R7\]**. Air purification improves human health, which boosts labour productivity, improves quality of life, and reduces healthcare costs. The Chief of Environmental Economic Accounts at the UN states that this *“work is directly linked to the pressure of economic activities on the environment in terms of air emissions captured in the air emission accounts.”* **\[S4\]**. Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team **\[R8\]** have *“provided convincing arguments describing why the SEEA Central Framework and SEEA Ecosystem Accounts are important to macroeconomic decision\-makers, particularly in finance ministries, central banks, and investors…This … demonstrates that the SEEA system of accounts is needed in economic, as well as environmental policy making.”* **\[S4\]**. 

 Professor Dasgupta chaired the high\-level  [Expert Group convened by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation \(MOSPI\)](https://seea.un.org/content/natural-capital-accounting-and-valuation-ecosystem-services-india), Government of India, to design a framework for green national accounts in India. The Expert Group published its report in 2013 which included a roadmap for implementing the Green Accounting Framework and recommended that economic evaluation be based on Dasgupta’s *Inclusive Wealth Framework* **\[R2, R3\]**. The 2018 publication from MOSPI, ‘Envistats\-India’ is explicit about the intention to “ *provide the technical ‘push’ to public policy imperatives in India, so that environmental information is mainstreamed to reshape government decision\-making for a “better environment, better tomorrow*” **\[S5** \(2018\) pX \(Roman\), paragraph 25 **\]**. All recommendations made by Dasgupta’s Expert Group were accepted by the Government of India and can be seen in the 2019 Envistats\-India report **\[S5** \(2019\) p3, paragraph 5 **\]**. 

 In 2018, Professor Coyle was appointed to the UK’s Industrial Strategy Council, an independent body set up to assess the UK Government’s Industrial Strategy. In October 2019, the Wealth Economy team’s measurement of social capital and trust was selected as one of the six ‘Headline Outcomes’ by the Council **\[S6\]**. This metric facilitates improvement in policy design by supporting the Council in evaluating how policy and economic change affect trust. The Head of Research at the Industrial Strategy Council is explicit about the role of the Cambridge Wealth Economy Team: *“The metrics identified by Dr Agarwala, with their robust theoretical backing, are now being used as part of the Council’s success metrics...and will inform the Council’s evaluation.”* **\[S7\]**. 

 Professor Coyle “ *trailblazed*” **\[S8\]** a new local industrial strategy when she chaired the Greater Manchester Independent Prosperity Review \(IPR\) from 2018 to 2019. Building on **\[R5; R6\]**, this culminated in March 2019 with the ‘Reviewers’ Report’ **\[S9\]**. The IPR analysis was accepted, in its entirety, by HM Treasury in June 2019, and provided the intellectual case for subsequent governance reforms. The Chief Economic Advisor to the Greater Manchester Combined Authority views *“Prof. Coyle’s contribution to the IPR to be an exemplary demonstration of the way in which specialised academic excellence and the credibility it can bring can be mobilised effectively to influence public policy and practice.”* **\[S8\]**. Professor Coyle also served as a Commissioner on the Cambridge and Peterborough Independent Economic Review until this concluded in September 2018. One of the founders of ‘Cambridge Ahead’ attests that Professor Coyle’s impact on the review’s thinking on measurement of natural capital was of the “ *highest importance.*” **\[S10\]**. 

 Professors Dasgupta and Coyle, Dr Agarwala and the Wealth Economy team’s research on Inclusive Wealth has profound ongoing effects on policy making in the UK. In March 2019, HM Treasury announced that Professor Dasgupta would lead a major assessment of the economic value of biodiversity **\[S11\]**. The \(interim\) Dasgupta Review was published in April 2020 and is due to be presented at the delayed meeting of the  [UN Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int/meetings/COP-15) in May 2021. The Wealth Economy team at Cambridge is working with the Office for National Statistics on incorporating ‘missing capitals’ such as social capital into official statistics **\[S12\]**. Lastly, Professor Coyle contributed **\[R4\]** to a review of the HM Treasury Green Book  [published in November 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/final-report-of-the-2020-green-book-review). *“Combined, the works of Professor Dasgupta, Professor Coyle, and Dr. Agarwala provide the economic rationale for moving Beyond GDP. Their work has highlighted the need for balanced investment in all components of wealth – natural, human, physical, and social capital – and crucially, the interdependencies between them.”* **\[S2\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In Ethiopia, the government rolled out second chance education programmes for out\-of\-school children in five regions on the basis of evidence produced by a Sussex research evaluation, which demonstrated that ‘Speed Schools’ in Ethiopia significantly reduce dropout, improve learning outcomes and enhance school completion rates. In Ghana, the government used similar research evidence to commit 1% of the basic education budget to complementary basic education targeting school dropouts. In both countries, the evidence was used to justify government adoption of second chance education programmes targeting 450,000 school dropouts to access public basic schools and address governments’ commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Achieving educational equality is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG 4. The widest inequalities occur in the least developed countries, where only about 4 in 10 children complete primary education. Of all Africa’s regions, Sub\-Saharan Africa \(SSA\) has the highest rates of children who do not complete primary and lower secondary education; over 20% of 6\-11 year olds, 33% of 12\-14 year olds and almost 60% of 15\-17 year olds are out of school \(UNESCO Institute of Statistics\). Once children miss a few years of school, bringing them back is very difficult because many public school teachers lack the ability to teach to bridge these learning gaps. 

 The Centre for International Education \(CIE\) at the University of Sussex conducts research into educational inequalities and the causes and effects of school dropout in low\-income countries \[R6\]. CIE research has also focused on the production of knowledge for education policymakers in sub\-Saharan Africa \(SSA\) to improve access to quality education for all. In particular, CIE’s research \(2004\-2016\) on educational access, transitions and equity produced knowledge \[R6\] underpinned the framing of research on second chance accelerated education programmes for out\-of\-school children in Ghana and Ethiopia. 

 A CIE research programme \(2005\-2010\), the Consortium for Educational Access, Transitions and Equity \(CREATE\), analysed regional variations in educational access and participation in SSA. This showed that in much of SSA, most children who are out of school have attended school at some point but the major cause of dropout was the poor quality education many experienced in the early years of schooling. The risk of dropout was highest in the early years of primary education, where many children were ‘silently excluded’ from learning due to teachers teaching above their level \[R6\]. CREATE concluded that for public schools to deliver quality education in African contexts, it needs fundamental reconceptualisation of teaching and learning in the early years so that funds of knowledge from African children can find better and deeper expression to achieve meaningful learning and prevent school dropout \[R6\]. 

 In 2009, CIE’s two\-year Teacher Preparation in Africa research Project \(TPA\), funded by the US Hewlett and Flora Foundation, examined teacher preparation in six African countries \(Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, Tanzania & Uganda\). It found that many trained teachers lacked the capacity to organise suitable learning in the early grades for many children to master basic literacy and numeracy skills, and contributed to the skills gap and school dropout \[R5\]. 

 In 2014, CIE researchers, funded by the US philanthropy consultancy company Geneva Global, studied the long\-term impact of a 10\-month second chance education programme ‘ *Speed School*’ for out\-of\-school children in Ethiopia to measure the impacts on formal primary school completion, learning outcomes, and attitudes towards learning. It found that former out\-of\-school students: 

1.  Perform consistently better than government school students for all three basic school subjects – math, Sidama and English 

1.  Are generally less likely to drop out compared to government school students who have had the same primary education 

1.  Are more likely to have aspirations to progress beyond primary education. 

 Crucially, this research revealed that the Speed School instructional approach was superior to the standard instructional practices of teachers in government schools \[R1\]. The pedagogy transformed the learning environment, enabling children who were initially unable to recognize letters to progress to reading passages in just 10 months. It found that the Speed School pedagogy was effective because it: utilised traditional group and multimodal learning methods; promoted greater collaboration in knowledge construction, linguistic expression and learner contribution to curriculum content; awakened and sustained the ability to learn among poor and marginalized children; and enabled them to repurpose learning after transition into public schools. In addition, Speed Schools achieved long\-term impact because of the use of mother\-tongue instruction and produced persistence and commitment to learn \[R1\]. 

 Subsequently CIE tested the effectiveness of another second chance complementary basic education \(CBE\) programme for Ghanaian school dropouts. This two\-year DIFD\-funded CBE research completed in October 2018, confirmed that it was possible to raise the achievement levels of previously out\-of\-school children to levels attained by children who have had four years of schooling in government schools. Many significantly outperformed their peers in government schools in literacy and numeracy skills. It also revealed \[R2, R3, R4\] that: 

1.  As in the Speed Schools, local language learning is essential for bridging the learning achievement gap for former primary school dropouts 

1.  CBE graduates developed skills, learning strategies and confidence, that they used to repurpose their education in public schools.

 **4. Details of the Impact** 

 CIE research on educational access, equity and transitions generated evidence that was used to engage key policy makers and stakeholders to influence policy and practice. Meetings held with Ministry of Education officials and key education stakeholders in both Ethiopia and Ghana discussed the significance of evidence showing how school dropouts closed basic skills gaps and successfully transitioned to public basic schools. The discussions on the evidence gave government officials confidence to introduce policies and strategies to roll out second chance education programmes for out\-of\-school children to access public basic education in both countries \[S4, S5, S6\]. 

 In Ghana, evidence from the CBE research was used to inform Ghana’s Education Strategic Plan on how to increase access to 250,000 out\-of\-school children \[S3, S4\]. Akyeampong presented evidence of the impact of CBE in Ghana to a specially convened meeting attended by the Minister of Education, his senior officials, and officials from the UK Department for International Development \(DFID\) and the US Agency for International Development \(USAID\) in September 2018. According to a senior official in Ghana’s Ministry of Education, the Sussex research “was instrumental in informing the Ministry’s policy”, directly influencing Ghana’s Education Strategic plan including the policy decision to spend 1% of the basic education budget on extending CBE to reach all out\-of\-school children \(equating to a spend of USD26,200,000 according to World Bank figures for 2018\) \[S4\], as also indicated in the press release by DFID \(now reconstituted under the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office \- FCDO\) \[S1, S2\]. 

 The British High Commission in Accra reported that the evidence from research led by “Professor Kwame Akyeampong from the University of Sussex, in collaboration with academics from the University of Cambridge, showed the importance of the government of Ghana taking forward the CBE programme to reach children from the poorest, and rural communities” \[S2, S3\]. In particular, they emphasised the findings of the research that, “after completing the CBE programme, CBE children placed in public schools \(often at P3 and P4 levels\) showed similar learning levels as children in public schools” \[S2\]. The key argument of the research was that the CBE programme was capable of meeting the learning needs of children who had dropped out of school and provided a way back into public schools. The result was new policy on second chance education to provide quality education for out\-of\-school children in Ghana \[S3\]. 

 Ghana’s Education Strategic Plan emphasised government adoption of the CBE to improve educational access for out\-of\-school children in Ghana. In November 2019, Akyeampong was invited by the Ghana Ministry of Education to present findings of the CBE research at the annual Education Evidence Week in Accra. The presentation showcased the role of mother\-tongue instruction and participatory pedagogy in improving learning in CBE schools. Evidence from the research inspired the Ministry of Education to introduce policies and reforms to ensure that all out\-of\-school children had a second chance to access quality basic education \[S3a, S3b\]. As a result of the government’s decision to increase focus on CBE in its education strategic plan, progress had been made in reducing the population of out\-of\-school children from 153,986 in 2018 to 35,432 in 2019 \[S3c\]. 

 In Ethiopia, the government adopted a second chance education programme upon the advice and support of Geneva Global, using Sussex research on Speed Schools. According to the Luminos Fund “The diligent work of Akyeampong and his team to provide robust evidence on the positive long\-term impact of the second chance program on out\-of\-school children … was used to secure commitment from the Ethiopia Ministry of Education to pursue government adoption and nationwide scale\-up of the program” \[S6\]. 

 The Ministry of Education commissioned Mekelle University in Ethiopia to confirm the Sussex findings on Speed Schools. Evidence from both was presented at a national education policy event in June 2018 \[S5\]. A senior official from the Ministry of Education said the Sussex research “contributed significantly in persuading many decision makers on the merits and usefulness of the Speed School model” and is “also influencing the country’s education system to bring about a system change … and bring about \[a\] shift in mindset of education officials and practitioners in Ethiopia” \[S5\]. 

 The model was first adopted by the Tigray Regional Education Bureau which fully financed 32 Speed School classrooms. Following this, the Ministry decided to use the Speed School model to condense the school curriculum into the national and regional curriculum frameworks and included Speed Schools in the sixth education sector development plan \(2020\-2025\) \[S5\]. Already the Oromiya region has started to set up a Speed School class in each of its 14,000 schools to help older children catch up; “just one example of the many other usages of the research to positively change the education system in the country” \[S5\]. The Ministry of Education’s investment in second chance education programmes has been seen as a key strategy in reaching 2.2 million out\-of\-school children. Starting in four regions, the programme is intended to be rolled out in other regions across the country \[S5, S6\]. 

 Sussex research continues to have influence. Over the next three years \(2020\-2023\), the Ministry of Education is taking further steps to take full ownership of Speed Schools in Ethiopia, using them as the preferred strategy for reaching out\-of\-school children throughout the country. The Ministry credits the work of Akyeampong and colleagues for this bold decision which is expected to reach over 4.7 million primary school aged children \[S5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at the University of Sheffield has directly impacted on a local regeneration strategy placing heritage at its heart. Sheffield Castle is a significant heritage resource in an area of extensive redevelopment and regeneration in the city centre. Its potential has not yet been fully realised, but by analysing and interrogating excavation data and artefacts, Moreland has revealed the full significance of the site. This research has supported the council to make decisions on funding work in Castlegate, the area surrounding the historical site of the castle, and in their efforts to use the heritage of the site to create a modern sense of place. Moreland has also increased public understanding and engagement with the site through augmented reality and has piloted this approach for use in future decisions about regeneration.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Excavations by University of Sheffield archaeologists James Symonds and Glyn Davies at Sheffield Markets in November and December 2001 demonstrated the survival of substantial remains of Sheffield Castle \(R1\). In 2002 Sheffield Department of Archaeology were commissioned by English Heritage to carry out an assessment of the archives from investigations in the 1920s and 1950s \(R2\). This confirmed the scale and significance of these legacy archives. In 2009, responding to questions raised late in 2008 by Sheffield City Council \(SCC\), Sheffield archaeologists Mark Stenton and Mike McCoy used our detailed knowledge of these archives to model the layout of the main buildings and associated archaeological deposits of Sheffield Castle \(R3\). In 2016, we secured the funding to finally undertake the first comprehensive study of the archives, including new analyses of the artefacts \(R4\). 

 In 2020, Moreland published the results in *Sheffield Castle: Archaeology, Archives, Regeneration, 1927\-2018,* \(R4\) the definitive account of the archaeology and long\-term history of the site of Sheffield Castle. Situating an innovative and meticulous analysis of these unpublished archives and new analyses of not previously studied or understudied artefacts in the context of unpublished lectures, newspaper reports, and redevelopment proposals, Moreland’s research generated new insights into the origins and development of Sheffield Castle, and into the lives of those who lived and worked there. It has shown how the ‘afterlife’ of the castle influenced the urban fabric of early modern Sheffield, and played an important part in its political, cultural, and sporting development. Further, it provides unique insights into the practice of archaeology in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, a pivotal moment in the development of the discipline. Critically, it has generated a detailed understanding of the sequence of deposits and structures across the site – knowledge of immense value to developers and urban planners. 

 *Sheffield Castle: Archaeology, Archives, Regeneration, 1927\-2018* transforms our understanding of the life history of the castle, from its origins through to its ‘sleighting’ on the orders of Parliament in 1646/7. We have shown that the castle was, in fact, only partially demolished, and that both its physical form and fabric, and the idea/memory of it, were major influences on the buildings and topography of 19<sup>th</sup>\- and early 20<sup>th</sup>\-century Sheffield. The bowling green constructed in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century, on what had once been the castle’s courtyard, was probably the first purpose\-built sporting venue in Sheffield. Our new analyses of the artefacts have brought ordinary men and women, often absent in castle studies, into the light of history, revealing, for example, their tastes in footwear, food, and drink, and confirming Sheffield as a centre of pottery production, leather manufacture, and \(of course\!\) cutlery. 

 Moreland’s meticulous investigation of the archives has demonstrated the sophistication of the recording practices that produced them, revealed the unexpected presence of a network of finds specialists who provided reports on metalwork, silver, plants, and more, and highlighted the importance of local archaeological societies. As such his work serves to rehabilitate the reputation and records of earlier generations of amateur archaeologists who have been uncritically denigrated since the professionalisation of the discipline in the 1960s. 

 Moreland has deployed his research to inform an augmented reality \(AR\) model of the castle \(created to emphasise its importance in Sheffield in the Middle Ages\), to contribute to a sense of civic identity that goes beyond stereotypes of ‘Steel City’, and as a step towards imagining possible futures \(R5\).

 Putting heritage at the heart of regeneration strategy 

 In 2013 Sheffield Markets \(which covered an area of c.17,000m<sup>2</sup>\) were closed and moved to the Moor in the west of the city. This new development cost £18 million. This was a direct result of Sheffield excavations and archival research which, having established the scale and importance of the surviving castle remains, informed SCC’s decision to halt the extension of the markets and relocate them, placing the castle remains at the heart of the regeneration of the castle site. 

 A 2014 Heritage Lottery Fund bid, informed by Moreland’s knowledge and expertise, to initiate this regeneration failed, but Moreland then secured funds from the University Alumni Office to address the key ‘known unknowns’ highlighted in the feedback. Moreland thus addressed the question of the quality of the surviving archaeology **\(S1\)** and the publication of archival material from earlier investigations **\(R4\)** which removed a significant block to future regeneration funding and enhanced knowledge of the nature, location, and scale of surviving archaeological structures and deposits **\(S1\)**. 

 Drawing on his archaeological expertise, and in his roles as Chair of the University’s Castlegate Steering Group and University representative on SCC’s Castlegate Partnership, in late 2016 Moreland worked with postgraduate students from the University’s School of Architecture on their *Revealing the Castle* project. Presentations to councillors and to SCC’s Growth Board demonstrated that excavation and regeneration of the castle site could take place in tandem, and persuaded them \(in July 2017\) to spend £786,000 to kickstart this process. This began with new excavations to evaluate the location and quality of the surviving archaeology \(so resolving the second of the ‘known unknowns’\) **\(S2, S3\)**. This key step towards regeneration has been supplemented by over £10 million to demolish and relocate the market, pedestrianize the area, convert Castlegate \(the road\) into a linear park with sustainable urban drainage and cycle routes, and to promote environmental sustainability **\(S3, S4\)**. 

 Moreland’s research was ‘absolutely essential’ in determining the location of excavations by Wessex Archaeology in 2018. It ensured that the most valuable information was recovered and interpreted **\(S5\)**. This work confirmed the existence of an early motte\-and\-bailey castle and detailed the deep history of the area, from the Middle Ages to the present day **\(S5, S6\)**. The scale and nature of the remains encountered ensured that SCC’s regeneration policy will ‘mix heritage and new development’ **\(S5, S6\)**. 

 Moreland’s understanding of Sheffield Castle’s archaeology has been acknowledged by Castlegate Programme Director Simon Ogden as pivotal in framing policies for future development, providing a deeper understanding of the social history of Castlegate, and using this to create a modern identity for the site. The physical remains of the castle and our sense of it as an articulating centre \(of culture, performance, decision making etc.\), as well as the multi\-layered history of the place, will be central to a regeneration which fulfils SCC’s ambition to establish a new role for Castlegate by making it into a distinct place again **\(S5, S6\)**. 

 Enhancing public understanding 

 Market research commissioned by SCC and the University in June 2014 revealed that 46% of those interviewed had never heard of Sheffield Castle and almost everyone else knew little about it **\(S7\)**. To rectify this, Moreland, along with colleagues from the Departments of Archaeology and Computer Science, the Friends of Sheffield Castle, and Human Studio created an \(AR\) reconstruction of the castle within the modern cityscape **\(S8\)**. This visualisation of Moreland’s research, linking heritage to regeneration, premiered at the University's Festival of the Mind in 2018 to 7,199 people **\(S8\)**. A further 8,620 people viewed and interacted with the model at the National Videogame Museum \(2019\) and 4,000 more at the Sheffield Heritage Fair \(2020\). Simon Ogden, speaking of the impact of the AR experience at the latter public event, called it “ *an excellent way of introducing people to the physical setting, landform, and complexities of the site and its history*,” and notes that “ *its real value as a public engagement medium is coming to fruition*” **\(S9\)**. It forms the centrepiece of SCC’s public consultation on the regeneration of the site \(delayed due to COVID\-19 restrictions\) **\(S8, S9\)**. Moreland also devised and presented a short film, celebrating the castle’s history and foregrounding its role in regeneration. It premiered at Festival of the Mind \(2020\) and was followed by a panel discussion, attracting 374 people **\(S5\)**. 

 Dissemination also occurred through dedicated university webpages, social media \(over 150,000 video views on Facebook, 4700 upvotes on Reddit\), excavation open days, AHRC funded walking tours, videos, traditional presentations, TV, radio, national and regional press, and the 2015 Castlegate Festival, which attracted over 1,000 visitors **\(S6, S8, S9, S10\)**. The 2018 excavation blog received over 3,000 hits and 17,000 enquiries **\(S6\)**. The book, which is free in digital format, has been downloaded 903 times since publication in September 2020. As a result of Moreland’s work, the public in Sheffield and beyond now know more about the long\-term significance of the Sheffield Castle site, and recognise the links between past and future regeneration. His approach has also provided a model for future work on ‘legacy archives’. 

 Moreland’s research on the site of Sheffield Castle has had a major impact on local authority decisions on urban planning and on public awareness of the city’s heritage. His work on the archives, his dissemination of the results through open access, and his use of AR to stimulate debate about future regeneration are models with much wider applicability.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Corrosion costs the oil and gas industry USD8,000,000,000 per annum in the USA alone. Concern about its impact on plant\-life limits the operator’s ability to take advantage of lower cost feedstocks because they are more corrosive. Our research solved this problem by monitoring corrosion in real time and in harsh conditions, with data transmitted directly to the plant control room. We invented two novel monitoring systems, one for high temperatures up to 600<sup>0</sup>C and another for temperatures up to 300<sup>0</sup>C with the ability to operate through coatings.  The impact of our research is: 

1.  We founded a spinout company, Permasense Ltd, to commercialise the research. The company was sold to Emerson for GBP32,400,000 in 2016 and now employs 52 staff in the UK. 

1.  Over 20,000 corrosion sensors have been deployed in over 200 sites world\-wide, generating revenues exceeding USD72,000,000 for the company over the current REF period. 

1.  Providing economic benefits and enhanced safety to companies in many industrial sectors including oil and gas, power generation and material processing companies, resulting in economic benefits estimated to be in several USD100,000,000 per annum. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Corrosion costs developed countries 3.4% of GDP \(Source A from Section 5\) and the annual cost of corrosion to the US oil and gas industry alone has been estimated to be about USD8,000,000,000 \(Source B from Section 5\). Wall loss is usually detected from ultrasonic thickness measurements but a particular problem is monitoring the progress of wall loss at high temperatures that are beyond the operational range of most piezoelectric materials from which ultrasonic transducers are made. Following conversations with industry this issue was investigated by Cawley and Cegla in the mid 2000’s. They used a waveguide as an ‘acoustic cable’ to transmit ultrasonic waves from a conventional transducer positioned outside the insulation to interrogate the hot structure. Previous work had looked at longitudinal modes in rod\-like waveguides for this purpose but they suffer from dispersion if the waveguide is thick, and transmit most of their energy into surface waves if it is thin. They recognised that shear horizontal waves in a strip\-like waveguide are essentially non\-dispersive and will couple via a dry contact into a cylindrically spreading wavefield in the test piece. This was a significant breakthrough. The concept was patented \[R1\] and published in \[R2\] and \[R3\].  This work was commercialised through their spinout company Permasense as discussed later. 

 While the first generation of corrosion monitoring sensors resulting from their research can operate up to 600<sup>0</sup>C, many potential applications require sensors that operate at lower temperature up to 300<sup>0</sup>C, but with the added complication that the pipes are often coated, e.g. with fusion bonded epoxy. Clamping the waveguides onto this surface tended to damage the coating so it was necessary to remove it, leading to corrosion susceptibility at the interface. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers \(EMATs\) can potentially operate through coatings but they suffer from poor signal to noise ratio \(SNR\) and are generally excited with drive pulses of >100V and this is not allowed in a typical petrochemical plant where intrinsically safe operation is required.  Cegla solved the signal\-to\-noise ratio problem by introducing two new ideas: flux concentrators \[R4\] and coded excitation \[R5\].  The research on flux concentrators showed that the ultrasonic signal is proportional to the square of the magnetic flux and a new compact magnetic circuit design was conceived that tripled the magnetic flux and improved the overall measurement SNR by roughly 20dB. This led to a further patent \[R6\] and an additional range of corrosion monitoring sensors that can penetrate pipe coatings. The research on coded excitation addressed the constraint that the maximum power of signals needs to be limited to avoid the potential of producing sparks in a hazardous environment and achieve safety \(ATEX\) certification for the sensors. Coded excitation achieves this by spreading out the energy over a longer time period and then pulse compressing the signal at the receiver. Conventional coded excitation could not be used in pulse echo mode \(sending and receiving on the same transducer\); the research led to a new coding scheme that enabled the use of very long excitation codes in pulse echo mode, improving the SNR of the measurement system by a further 20dB.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Context and history of impact</ins> 

 Corrosion in pipes is a serious problem in many industrial sectors, particularly in oil and gas. It is estimated that such corrosion problems cost developed countries 3.4% of GDP \(Source A\).  It has also been reported that in the US oil and gas industry alone, the annual cost is estimated to be about USD8,000,000,000 \(Source B\). 

 BP contacted Cawley in 2006 wanting a method that would allow them to monitor internal wall loss due to corrosion or erosion in pipes and vessels operating at high \(>400<sup>0</sup>C\) temperatures during operation. The waveguide concept had recently been patented \[R1\] and BP funded a trial deployment of waveguide sensors at Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany. At this stage they were deployed on hot plant, but readings were taken manually by plugging in a standard ultrasonic test set. This was successful and BP then funded the Imperial team to develop a wireless system that involved installing custom electronics and a battery on the cold end of the waveguide, measurements typically taken every 12 hours being transmitted to a base station via a low power mesh network, so providing ‘data to desk’. This concept worked very well and intrinsic safety certification was obtained, enabling it to be operated on refineries and other plant. 

 The IP was owned by Imperial Innovations and following the success of the trial, they agreed to the formation of a spinout company, Permasense Ltd, to market the technology, initially to BP who had exclusive rights to use it in return for funding the development work. Cawley was chairman of the company, Cegla was a director and two of the original employees had been involved in the development work. BP placed an initial order for 3000 sensors to be delivered in 2010 and this enabled the company to ‘bootstrap’ without requiring capital funding. In 2011 an agreement was reached with BP for the technology to be marketed worldwide to other companies in both the oil and gas and other sectors. 

 <ins>Impact in the current REF period</ins> 

1.  **Further developing a successful spinout company Permasense Ltd** 

 During the current REF period, Permasense Ltd has “… *achieved global success and its technology has become the market leader and a global standard.*” \(Source C\). In 2015, Permasense featured as one of the 10 ‘Ones to Watch’ in the Sunday Times Tech Track 100 list.  The success of this spinout company, whose technology is derived entirely from the research from Cawley and Cegla, is clearly evidenced when in September 2016, Emerson, a Fortune 500 company, purchased the company for GBP32,400,000 \(Source D\). This synergetic acquisition provides Permasense \(and the impact of our research\) the opportunity to extend its reach by integration into the sales force and distribution channels of a large multinational company. 

 
The pipeline for translation from research to impactful industrial applications between our team and Permasense continued over the current REF period. Before the publication of Cegla’s research \[R4\] and \[R5\], the original waveguide sensors were sometimes applied on lower temperature plant, but it became clear that sales in this market were restricted by the difficulty of installing over a coating such as fusion bonded epoxy as the waveguide tips tended to damage the coating and so create a potential corrosion site. This led Permasense to license the patent \[R6\] and adopt the EMAT system based on Cegla’s underpinning research described in Section 2 above. 

1.  **Generating revenue and employment in the UK** 

 
 Over 20,000 corrosion sensors have been deployed in over 200 installations including 135 refineries, 33 upstream sites and other industrial plants worldwide \(Source E, see figure\).  Most of these sales and deployments happened since 2014.  The sales value of sensors and associated services exceeded USD72,000,000 over the current REF period \(Source F\).  The company now employs over 50 highly qualified staff at its Crawley site including 3 PhD graduates from the Imperial College group. 

1.  **Providing economic benefits and enhanced safety to companies** 

 In addition to economic impact from direct sales of the monitoring system by Permasense, deployment of our technology has also enabled refineries to optimise their feedstock and to reduce the use of corrosion inhibitor chemicals. Higher TAN \(acidic\) crude oil is more corrosive than ‘sweet’ crudes and so if processed without appropriate corrosion inhibition and/or monitoring could lead to plant failure with huge human safety and economic implications. Our technology has become a major tool in BP’s strategy for corrosion prevention \(Source G\).  As an example, the installation of the system at BP’s Gelsenkirchen refinery enabled the operator to reduce feedstock costs and process low cost but high TAN acidic crude without the risk of corroding through their pipework. This resulted in additional profit of EUR100,000,000 over a 2.5\-year period, i.e. EUR40,000,000 per year \(Source H\). 

 Another example is the PTT Global Chemical Company Rayong refinery in Thailand where savings of USD300,000 per annum in inhibitor chemicals by installing a Permasense monitoring system have been achieved \(Source I\). 



 A further advantage of the permanently installed monitoring system is that it enables improved equipment life management. This is beneficial because it reduces the number of unplanned outages and enables better scheduling of remediation work. This leads to shorter outages and hence less lost production and lower costs for the remediation work as components can be ordered in advance at better prices. Depending on the application, the installation of a small \(\~25\) sensor network can result in savings of EUR1,500,000 to EUR4,000,000 per installation. \(Source H\). 

 The monitoring system also leads to major savings in the upstream oil industry. For example, Shell Brunei had a well that was prone to producing sand, leading to severe erosion problems. Installing a Permasense monitoring system meant the well no longer had to be classified as high risk and an extra 80 m<sup>3</sup>/day \(\~500 barrels/day\) of oil could be produced at a value of USD11,000,000 per annum; a similar volume of gas was also produced. \(Source J\). 

 The four example applications discussed above are drawn from over 200 installations at customer sites. These four cases to date led to savings or increased production benefits of over USD50,000,000 per annum. Therefore, while it is not possible to compile an exact figure, it is not unreasonable to estimate that the overall financial benefit to industries from the 200 total installations is in the region of hundreds of millions of US dollars per annum. Additionally, the deployed systems have resulted in enhanced safety assurance and reduced the need for human personnel to enter hazardous environments.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor David Barford's team at The Institute of Cancer Research \(ICR\) solved the crystal structure of AKT \(also known as protein kinase B, PKB\) and helped directly to develop two innovative AKT inhibitor drug discovery approaches, leading to the following impacts: 

-  **Commercial interest.** There are currently at least 12 AKT inhibitors in clinical development, including drugs from GSK, AstraZeneca, Genentech, and Merck. One of the AKT inhibitors in clinical development, capivasertib, is from a joint ICR and Astex AKT drug discovery programme. 

-  **Patient benefit.** There have been over 80 trials of AKT inhibitors in a variety of cancers. Capivasertib is being evaluated in three phase 3 trials in endocrine\-resistant advanced breast cancer, triple\-negative breast cancer, and PTEN\-deficient prostate cancer. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background.** Proliferation, angiogenesis and programmed cell death are three cellular activities often found deregulated in cancer. The serine/threonine kinase AKT, also known as protein kinase B \(PKB\), regulates all three of these processes and is itself regulated through the PI3 kinase signalling pathway. This pathway is one of the most frequently activated pathogenic signalling routes in human cancer—affecting 30–50% of malignancies. In addition, the three closely related isoforms of AKT \(AKT1, 2, and 3\) have been found mutated, amplified, overexpressed, or inappropriately activated in a number of tumour types. As such, AKT is a potential target for anti\-cancer drugs—but development of inhibitors of AKT had been hindered by the lack of protein structural information. 

 **Elucidating the crystal structure of AKT.** By the early 2000s, it had been established that AKT is activated by two phosphorylation events. While it was known that PDK1 phosphorylates Thr309, the kinase responsible for phosphorylating Ser474 in the hydrophobic motif had not been identified. There was therefore no procedure for generating activated AKT protein for structural studies. In 2002, Professor David Barford \(ICR Team Leader\) and his team described a method whereby they introduced a peptide containing a particular hydrophobic motif \(known as PIFtide\) to mimic a phosphorylated Ser474 residue, which circumvented the need to phosphorylate Ser474. This enabled Professor Barford’s team to produce activated AKT for structural, biochemical, and functional studies. The innovative protein engineering used in the design of the phospho\-Ser474 mimetic constituted a major breakthrough in the field. Following this major technical advance, Professor Barford’s team, in collaboration with a team at the Friedrich Miescher Institute, published the crystal structure of AKT, and provided a molecular explanation for the regulation of AKT by Ser474 phosphorylation \( **Ref. 1** and **2**\). The ICR teams made the expression systems encoding the engineered protein widely available to commercial companies and academic researchers. The ICR also filed several patents relating to the crystal coordinates and methods for crystallizing the protein \(GB0119860.5, filed 14 August 2001; GB0209985.1, filed 1 May 2002; and GB0216215.4, filed 12 July 2002\). 

 **Facilitating the discovery of potential AKT inhibitors.** The Barford team collaborated with ICR drug discovery teams led by Dr Michelle Garrett \(ICR Team Leader 1999 to 2014\) and Professor Paul Workman \(current ICR Team Leader, UOA1\), with Professor Ian Collins \(current ICR Team Leader, UOA1\) as lead chemist. They began an in\-house drug discovery research programme in 2002, with an aim to find ATP competitive inhibitors of AKT. In 2003, the ICR team began a collaboration with the UK company Astex on this research programme. The collaboration saw the use of a number of innovative approaches, including fragment\-based lead discovery, which facilitated the rapid identification of novel, low\-molecular weight AKT inhibitors \( **Ref. 3**\). Another innovative approach was a ‘back\-soaking’ method for obtaining AKT\-ligand crystal structures, which allowed the teams to fully exploit AKT structural information within the drug discovery process \( **Ref. 4**\). 

 The collaborative ICR\-Astex drug discovery research programme elaborated two fragment hits from the AKT screen, using structure\-based design and medicinal chemistry based on the protein structure information from Professor’s Barford team \( **Ref. 1** and **2**\). Four chemical series were found by this approach—two were prioritised—which also helped validate AKT as a potential oncology target. A lead series that was discovered by the ICR and Astex was licensed in 2005 to AstraZeneca who then selected AZD5363 \(capivasertib\) for clinical development. Capivasertib has been evaluated in various clinical trials, including ones led by ICR researchers Professors Nicholas Turner and Udai Banerji \( *see Section 4*\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Following the ICR\-led publication of the AKT crystal structure, there has been widespread activity in developing AKT inhibitors across the pharmaceutical industry with at least 12 AKT inhibitors in clinical development and over 80 AKT inhibitors in clinical trials—either alone or in combination with other therapies **\[A\]**. Importantly, the AKT inhibitor capivasertib, which is based on a chemical series discovered jointly by the ICR and Astex, has now entered phase III trials in three therapeutic indications and is therefore benefiting cancer patients directly by offering new treatment opportunities. A second lead series \(AT13148\) was also identified, which was retained by Astex. However, based on the narrow therapeutic index and the pharmacokinetic profile seen in the first\-in\-human study, the decision was taken not to develop this compound further. 

 **Clinical development of capivasertib and patient benefit.** The first\-in\-human trial of capivasertib was carried out by Professor Udai Banerji \(ICR Team Leader, UOA1\) with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust \(RM\) and the Christie Hospital NHS Trust, both in the UK and in the Netherlands. This study recruited 90 patients with advanced solid tumours to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti\-cancer activity of capivasertib. The study identified a recommended phase 2 dose using an intermittent dosing schedule and demonstrated that capivasertib was well\-tolerated and achieved robust target modulation. The dosing schedules were optimised using pharmacodynamic biomarker assays, which were developed and run at the ICR. The study also explored single\-agent activity of capivasertib in populations of patients who had metastatic breast and gynaecologic cancers with PIK3CA mutations. Results suggest that future efforts in developing this class of drugs for the treatment of solid tumours, including PIK3CA\-mutated breast and gynaecologic cancers, could benefit from combination studies with other anti\-cancer drugs **\[B\]**. Professor Nicholas Turner led the BEECH study, which investigated capivasertib combined with paclitaxel in patients with estrogen receptor\-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and in a PIK3CA mutant sub\-population. 

 Following identification of a recommended phase 2 dose, the safety and efficacy of capivasertib was further explored in multiple molecularly and histologically defined phase 1 expansion cohorts. Through an expansion cohort, involving Professor Banerji, proof of concept was demonstrated for both single\-agent activity, and a combination of capivasertib with fulvestrant for the treatment of breast cancer with AKT mutations **\[C\]**. 

 As of December 2020, there were 27 clinical trials of capivasertib registered on clinicaltrials.gov, providing patients with experimental treatment options **\[D\]**. In 2019, the phase 2 FAKTION trial of 140 patients \( [NCT01992952](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01992952)\) reported that addition of capivasertib to fulvestrant for patients with endocrine\-resistant advanced breast cancer resulted in significantly longer median progression\-free survival \(10.3 months compared to 4.8 months for placebo\) and an improvement in overall survival \(26.0 months compared to 20.0 months for placebo\) **\[E\]**. On the basis of these results, the CAPItello\-291 trial \(NCT04305496\) was initiated, which will enrol 830 patients across 20 countries to evaluate capivasertib combined with fulvestrant. 

 Data from the phase 2 trial of capivasertib with paclitaxel, PAKT \(which involved Professor Turner\), demonstrated the impact of this combination on progression\-free survival and overall survival in previously untreated, metastatic triple\-negative breast cancer. This trial involved 140 patients and showed a median overall survival of 19.1 months for capivasertib compared to 12.6 months for placebo **\[F\]**. The results from PAKT formed the basis of a phase 3 trial of capivasertib with paclitaxel in triple\-negative breast cancer \(NCT03997123\). This trial opened to recruitment in 2019 and expects to enrol 800 patients in the United States, United Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Czechia, France, Greece, Hungary, Japan, India, Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Taiwan, Turkey, and Vietnam. 

 The ProCAID phase 2 study \(NCT02121639\) showed that the combination of capivasertib with docetaxel improved overall survival in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer **\[G\]**. Further, a phase 3 study of capivasertib in combination with abiraterone in PTEN\-deficient prostate cancer is ongoing \(NCT04493853\), and is expected to enrol 1,000 patients. 

 **Other ICR trials of capivasertib.** In an ICR trial, antitumor activity of capivasertib combined with olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was observed in patients harbouring advanced solid tumours with germline BRCA1/2 mutations and BRCA1/2 wild\-type cancers with or without somatic DNA damage response and/or PI3K–AKT pathway alterations. These results support the development of the combination of olaparib and capivasertib as a promising strategy that warrants further exploration in future clinical trials **\[H\]**. Professor Turner is investigating capivasertib in plasmaMATCH \(NCT03182634\), a phase 2 trial looking at circulating tumour DNA testing in advanced breast cancer. In this trial, capivasertib had high activity in patients with ctDNA\-identified AKT mutations, both in hormone receptor\-positive cancer with fulvestrant and in hormone receptor\-negative cancer as a single agent. 

 **Other AKT inhibitors in clinical development.** Several other AKT inhibitors have entered clinical studies including the ATP\-competitive AKT inhibitors GDC\-0068 \(ipatesertib\) and GSK2110183 \(afuresertib\), as well as Merck’s allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 **\[A\]**. The ICR’s Professor Johann de Bono led a phase 3 trial of ipatesertib in combination with abiraterone in metastatic castration\-resistant prostate with PTEN loss and initial results have shown improved progression free survival **\[I\]**. There are AKT inhibitors whose use with bortezomib, rituximab, and ofatumumab is being explored for the treatment of haematological malignancies. Finally, there are ongoing clinical studies exploring combinations of AKT and MEK inhibitors in gastric and colorectal cancers. This large number of trials benefits patients with a variety of cancers by providing them access to new experimental treatments when no other options are available. 

 **The international AKT drug discovery effort has been facilitated by ICR's work.** The ICR has made a major impact on the international search for AKT and its inhibitors. This research has enabled a number of pharmaceutical companies to advance their research programmes for the development and commercialisation of novel drugs. The ICR patents on crystal coordinates and crystalisation methods \(GB0119860.5, GB0209985.1, and GB0216215.4\) have been licensed to six commercial companies \(not named for confidentially reasons\), alongside experimental material \(e.g. plasmid vectors and baculovirus encoding AKT\). This demonstrates the interest from the commercial sector in AKT as a therapeutic target. 

 A lead series that was discovered by the ICR and Astex was licensed in 2005 to AstraZeneca who then selected AZD5363 \(capivasertib\) for clinical development. In addition to this discovery, ICR researchers have worked with AstraZeneca to develop the pharmacodynamic biomarkers that supported the early clinical development of capivasertib. The ICR team analysed these biomarkers in platelet\-rich plasma and hair follicles, providing evidence of target modulation in the first\-in\-human trial—which was pivotal in determining a recommended dose and schedule of capivasertib **\[B\]** —and also on six additional capivasertib trials, including two ICR/RM academic investigator\-initiated studies of capivasertib in combination with enzalutamide \(RE\-AKT, NCT02525068\) or the PARP inhibitor olaparib \(ComPAKT, NCT02338622\) **.** 

 ICR\-led research on the AKT crystal structure was described in two publications \( **Ref. 1** and **2**\).  27 different international commercial companies have cited Reference 1 \(54 citations\) and 40 different international commercial companies have cited Reference 2 \(>90 citations\) \(data from Web of Science, 2019\)—evidence that ICR work played a vitally important role in the research and investment of commercial companies. 

 Japanese company Otsuka Holdings Co. acquired Astex Pharmaceuticals Inc. for about USD886,000,000 **\[J\].** Their drug discovery/development pipeline, which included the AKT project, was a key attraction. At the time James Manuso, PhD, chairman and chief executive officer of Astex Pharmaceuticals stated: 

 “*We believe that Otsuka's financial resources and development expertise will enhance Astex's ability to build further its oncology portfolio, pipeline, and discovery prowess.*"" **\[J\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Despite targeted funding, participation in science\-related study and extra\-curricular activities in post\-compulsory education remains patterned along gender, ethnicity and social class lines. To explain and better understand these patterns, researchers at King’s College London proposed the concept of ‘science capital’ – an aggregate of one’s science\-related knowledge, attitudes, experiences and connections. The concept and associated research have provided the underpinning rationale for national governmental and third sector strategies aimed at supporting aspirations and public engagement in science, as well as informing national and international science assessment measures.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The impact reported in this case study has been underpinned by a ten\-year ESRC\-funded programme of research led by Professor Louise Archer – the ‘Young People’s Career Aspirations in Science’ studies \(ASPIRES 1 and 2\) \[7,8\]. The research followed a cohort of students in England from ages 10 to 19 in order to better understand the factors affecting the realisation, or otherwise, of their science\-related aspirations and trajectories. It began at King’s College London’s School of Education, Communication and Society in 2009 and moved to the UCL Institute of Education in 2017. 

 The research in the ASPIRES projects comprised a series of cross\-sectional quantitative surveys and in\-depth qualitative interviews. The surveys were completed by a cohort of students in five phases spanning the period from when they were in their last year of primary school \(Year 6\) to when they were in the final year of compulsory education \(Year 13\). Each survey was nationally representative of the school population in England \(although students participating in one survey had not necessarily completed a previous survey\). For ASPIRES 1, over 19,000 surveys were completed: 9,319 by Year 6 students, 5,634 by Year 8 students and 4,600 by Year 9 students. For ASPIRES 2, a further 20,434 surveys were completed: 13,421 by Year 11 students and 7,013 by students in Year 13 or the equivalent. The qualitative interviews were conducted over the same five phases with a smaller group drawn from the same cohort of students. These enabled the researchers to track over 80 students and their parents in ASPIRES 1 as they moved from Year 6 to Year 9 and over 60 of these same students and their parents in ASPIRES 2 when they were in Year 11 and Year 13. 

 The data showed that most young people reported liking and valuing science and that their parents valued science too. The data also showed that young people’s aspirations were relatively consistent over time, but few aspired to become scientists \[2\]. Analyses further showed that aspirations and personal perceptions of one’s ability in science are directly shaped by social class, gender and ethnicity \[2\]. For example, across all age groups, the students who were significantly more likely to express science aspirations and perceive themselves to be good at science came from socio\-economically advantaged families. Boys were also significantly more likely to report wanting to study science in the future and to perceive themselves as being good at science. By contrast, girls were less likely to aspire to study science in the future, and more likely to state that they were not good at science and that they did not see themselves as ‘sciencey’. Ethnicity was also found to be significant in determining the likelihood of young people having science\-related aspirations, with Black students overwhelmingly seeing the careers of scientist or science teacher as ‘not for me’ despite being interested in science \[3\]. Irrespective of class, gender and ethnicity, students with a family member with a science qualification and/or science\-related job were significantly more likely to have science\-related aspirations and to perceive themselves as good at science. The intersectionality of contributing factors produces a complex picture: Asian male students with a family member working in science were found to be most likely to have science\-related educational and career aspirations. Conversely, students found to be least likely to aspire to a science\-related future tended to be white and female with no family members working in science\-related fields \[1,2,3,4\]. 

 To explain these varied patterns in science aspirations and perceptions, Archer and her team proposed the concept of science capital \[4\]. Science capital encapsulates all the science\-related knowledge, attitudes, experiences and connections that an individual acquires and builds throughout their life. It equates to what you know about science, how you think about science, what you do that is science\-related and who you know who works in or engages with science. Inspired by the work of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu on the role that different forms of capital play in the inter\-generational reproduction of social and economic advantage, the concept of science capital was developed to direct attention to wider structural factors affecting a young person’s opportunities to access science, and to provide an explanation for disengagement that does not rest on a deficit construction of young people as simply lacking interest. 

 The concept was tested empirically by comparing the ability of the science capital construct to predict science aspirations\-related outcomes against a measure of cultural capital \[5\]. Science capital was found to be the better predictor. The concept and its application to educational contexts was also tested in practice by working in partnership with teachers and museum education practitioners in a follow\-up project \(‘Enterprising Science’, 2012–2017 \[9\]\). The findings of this project \[6\] highlighted the constituent components of the science capital construct that educators found clear and less clear, and identified effective pedagogical practices for building science capital, such as involving families in science learning experiences and promoting the broad possibilities of science\-related futures. 

 The concept of science capital developed and refined by Archer and colleagues provides the field of science engagement with an analytic tool that both explains and illuminates why some students feel able to participate in science\-related activities and study while others do not. Their research findings have additionally shown the importance of building a science identity from a young age and confirmed the importance of how a student’s ability to ‘get on’ in life is shaped by the diverse resources they acquire from home, community and school.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The concept of science capital and the detailed findings from the ASPIRES research have formed the bedrock for the design and implementation of new policies, initiatives and assessments aimed at widening participation, which recognise the importance of building learners’ science identities from an early age and the role played by families and schools in forming young people’s science\-related aspirations. 

#  Science identity and science capital at the heart of international and national assessments 

 On the international stage, ASPIRES research has had a direct impact on how the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment \(PISA\) evaluates science education. PISA, implemented every three years, assesses 15\-year\-olds’ performance in the fields of reading, mathematics and science. The results are widely reported and debated in the media and often used as a measure of a country’s educational success. Science capital is listed as a key indicator in the new ‘Scientific Identity’ dimension that is being introduced as part of PISA 2024. This new dimension reflects the extensive evidence linking identity to science learning and attainment and is identified as “an important and urgent priority” in the *PISA 2024 Strategic Vision and Direction for Science* report \[A p.12\]. The report further states that science capital *“plays a key role in shaping the extent to which a young person experiences science as being ‘for me’ or not, and significantly relates to post\-16 science aspirations and progression.”* \[A p.14\]. 79 countries currently participate in PISA and many shape their curricula in response to its specific dimensions. 

 Domestically, ASPIRES findings have impacted assessment practices in primary schools across England with science capital now a key criterion in the Ofsted\-endorsed Primary Science Quality Mark \(PSQM\) \[B1\]. This national award scheme recognises schools that demonstrate effective and confident science leadership and is delivered as a year\-long teacher professional development programme. Clare Warren, a senior PSQM leader, reported that *“Science capital is an important concept for primary schools to consider, because children aged 10 with low science capital, who also expressed no interest in STEM careers, were very unlikely to have changed their minds by the age of 14. It is for this very reason that, when the PSQM criteria were amended in 2017, the new criterion, ‘L3: There is a commitment to developing all children’s science capital’, was incorporated*” \[B2 p.22\]. The criterion assesses the ways in which schools build children’s science capital through extended outreach work with parents and involving children in extracurricular activities. The PSQM impacts 240,000 children and 9,000 teachers annually. 

#  Influencing strategic plans aimed at building young people’s science aspirations 

 Insights from ASPIRES findings regarding the social factors shaping young people’s participation in science, and the root causes of disengagement, have directly influenced governmental strategies for diversifying and widening participation in science education and careers. In England, the 2017 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee’s report on ‘Science Communication and Engagement’ was commissioned to enhance engagement with the public on funding, policy and future research directions in science. The report draws on the concept of science capital to frame its discussion on the opportunities for promoting greater science awareness in the public sphere \[C1 p.3,9,10,11,26\]. The report was informed by evidence submitted by the National Forum for Public Engagement in STEM \(a collective of key funders and organisations involved in setting the agenda for public engagement in STEM nationally\). The Forum’s evidence highlighted the significant contribution of ASPIRES research findings in focusing their member organisations’ attention on the ways in which children’s science identities are formed and how, for some children, intersectional factors combine with the result that science careers are seen as ‘not for me’ \[C2 p.5,7\]. 

 ASPIRES research findings relating to socio\-economic disadvantages were used in the 2017 Scottish Government’s STEM Strategy to frame the broad societal challenges that need to be overcome to widen participation in STEM education and careers in Scotland. The Strategy referenced the ASPIRES research as part of its ‘Evidence Base’ \[D p.17\], in particular its identification of the role that ‘key influencers’ \(ie teachers and parents\) play in promoting science careers awareness and the need for STEM\-related subjects to be promoted across all school ages. The social contexts in which science capital is acquired and built are also noted in the 2019 Scottish Parliament’s inquiry into ‘STEM in early years education’ \[E1 p.3\]. The report of the inquiry highlights correlations between the inclusion of STEM education in the early years curriculum and children’s continued competence and interest in STEM into adulthood, noting the importance of STEM education in the early years for children who are socio\-economically disadvantaged and/or have limited access to STEM capital in the home. This inquiry prompted the subsequent creation of a new online module for early learning and childcare staff across Scotland to help them inspire young children in science and maths \[E2\]. 

#  Refocusing outreach and engagement programmes 

 National organisations, science museums, learned societies and charities have used the concept of science capital, and the findings of associated research on how it can best be built, to direct their engagement and outreach activities. For example, the Institute of Physics – the professional body and learned society for physics in the UK and Ireland – used the research to refocus its programming upon families with primary\-aged children. The Public Programmes Manager at the Institute states that, *“The work of the ASPIRES project, and particularly the definition of Science Capital, has been invaluable in guiding and shaping the family outreach and public engagement work done by the Institute of Physics. A key pillar of the IOP’s work is in raising public awareness and appreciation of science in everyday life and how science is addressing the challenges facing society. In response to the ASPIRES findings, the focus for outreach and engagement activities are families with KS1/KS2 children to try and reach them at a time when we could have the most impact. Our approach is to engage the whole family, with follow\-on activities and resources for the home, to support families to have conversations about the relevance of science, empowering them to gradually build their own science capital”* \[F\]. 

 The British Science Association \(BSA\), the learned society founded in 1831 to aid the promotion and development of science, has similarly used ASPIRES findings to change its public engagement priorities. The Chief Executive of the BSA notes, “The ASPIRES findings showed very clearly that our \[previous\] approach was flawed: most children had already decided they did not want to ‘be’ a scientist by the time they finished primary school. We decided to prioritise primary\-aged children instead of secondary\-aged children and switched the majority of our education programme resources to our under\-developed primary CREST scheme instead. Since 2016, we have reached over 50,000 primary school children directly, and many more indirectly. We brought many of our CREST partners and stakeholders with us on this journey and the ASPIRES ‘killer slide’ \[1, figure 2, p.2\] was part of our standard presentation template during this period, to explain the rationale behind our change of strategy” \[G\]. 

 **Changing the direction of organisations’ thinking** 

 ASPIRES research findings have been used by organisations to underpin their strategic objectives. For example, the Science Museum Group has described its commitment to growing the science capital of their audiences as a core priority, stating, “We use the principles of science capital to shape all science engagement experiences… our organising principle is to build science capital to enrich people’s lives and enhance their contributions to society” \[H p.16\]. The BSA, meanwhile, acknowledges that the research has changed the very working practices of their organisation. Its Chief Executive explains that *“the work of Professor Archer and her team has helped us understand that the BSA itself needs to change, if we are to succeed in our goal of enabling more people to develop a stronger ‘science identity’. This led to us putting equality, diversity and inclusion at the heart of our mission. We recognise that we are part of the field and therefore we need to change. We have committed to improving the diversity and inclusivity of our workforce. We have invested in our own audience analysis to better understand how the most under\-served communities relate to science… \[ASPIRES research\] has had a significant effect on our work and our approach, and I believe it will continue to do so for many years”* \[G\]. 

 The impact of the ASPIRES research programme continues to grow. The research has been awarded the British Educational Research Association Public Engagement and Impact Award in 2018, was a finalist in the ESRC Outstanding Societal Impact prize of 2019 and has seeded subsequent studies and initiatives nationally and internationally. The Impact Case Study submitted by the UCL Institute of Education further describes the impact of research which utilises the concept of science capital to guide more equitable science engagement initiatives.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Edinburgh Napier University's \(ENU\) low\-latency \(LOLA\) research group, led by Dr Paul Ferguson, has introduced UK and international education institutions, rural ensembles and leading orchestras to remote real\-time rehearsal, teaching and performance over high\-performance networks. Supported by AHRC, EPSRC and Industrial Strategy Immersive Experiences funding, the work has led to new partnerships with leading audio manufacturers Focusrite and Audinate, collaboration with Abbey Road Studios, live BBC World Service radio broadcasts, and innovative digital world firsts. This has supported new product research and development, input to new professional practice and future 5G development, stimulated new media production partnerships and resulted in real\-time performances across 30 countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\)Low\-latency audio\-only long\-distance networked audio has been possible using JackTrip since around 2004, but systems incorporating video typically introduce 200ms to 500ms delay. In order for musicians to play together in time, the delay needs to be reduced to 50ms at least, with a figure of 11.5ms regarded as the ideal for real\-time synchronisation \(musicians hearing each other’s performance at the same time as if they were in the same room\). LoLa \(a low\-latency audio/video streaming system\) is the product of a research partnership between Conservatorio Tartini and network engineers at GARR \(the Italian national computer network for universities and research\), designed to reduce the delay of audio/video transmission to the point that remote musicians can successfully play together. However, much work remains to be done towards the application of this system for meaningful employment of video to enhance the musicians’ sense of engagement with one another.In July 2012, in partnership with JISC/JANET \(the UK’s National Research and Education Network\), ENU researchers carried out the UK’s first real\-time streaming trials of the LoLa low\-latency audio/video streaming system between the UK and Italy. Ferguson’s findings led directly to LoLa software changes to improve music quality \[O1\]. 

###  In September 2013, ENU were invited by JISC to give the UK’s first public demonstration of real\-time live music performance by musicians from the Royal College of Music over distance at the first Arts and Humanities Streaming Workshop. Findings from this trial resulted in further research and testing which led to a demonstration at the 2013 TERENA TNC13 conference, where a trumpet player at ENU appeared ‘virtually’ on stage in Maastricht, the Netherlands, to 

###  lead a jazz quartet performing live in front of the conference delegates. This proved to be a landmark test in this research field, that demonstrated how musicians separated by large distances could play together meaningfully and provide an engaging audience experience.In 2013\-14, ENU participated in a project consortium with partners from Conservatorio di Musica Giuseppe Tartini in Trieste, the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, and three European National Research and Education Networks \(NRENs\); CESNET \(Czech Republic\), GARR \(Italy\), and JISC/JANET \(UK\). The aim of the project was to evaluate the use of the GÉANT \(the pan\-European data network for the research and education community interconnecting NRENs across Europe\) Bandwidth on Demand \(BoD\) service, to support remote education and collaboration in music \(eLearning\) and remote access to cultural performances \(eCulture\). Although the user interface proved complex, requiring trained network engineers to operate it, the educational and collaborative impact of the activities enabled by the project was deemed significant \[O3\].In 2015 ENU carried out the UK’s first use of LoLa with a commercial ensemble. The Hebrides Ensemble, together with composer Sir James Macmillan, gave a real\-time interactive masterclass between Italy and the UK. Research emphasis was placed on the user experience and through the placement of loudspeakers and the use of a life\-sized video of the horn player. Participants noted significant improvements in both audio and visual immersion which enhanced the possibilities of rehearsal between remote locations \[O2\].In collaboration with Soluis Sublime \(creating ‘ *next\-generation immersive experiences and technology to transform the worlds of learning, work, and communication’*\), ENU employed an immersive dome environment in order to significantly enhance the experience of a remote musician during real\-time co\-performance across long distances. The immersive environment promotes a sense of ‘togetherness’ and a shared experience of ‘space’. This project involved the first use of eye\-tracking glasses in real\-time performance research \[O4\]. 

 Recent research has sought to clarify understanding and best practice in the field of remote recording and performance. ENU researchers have analysed existing online tools and resources for remote collaboration **\[O5\]**, and evaluated their use in practice with the Radio Science Orchestra at Innovation in Music 2019 \(University of West London\) **\[O6\]**, to ascertain best practice in practical application of remote performance software.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)The principal beneficiaries of this work have been musicians and commercial partners in the field of digital audio. The research has increased connectivity between geographically distant musicians, led to wider accessibility of collaborative performances, and reduced the necessity for travel and the resulting lower carbon footprint. The musicians who have benefited from this research include professional bands, soloists, and ensembles, but also musicians teaching and training at conservatoires across the UK, the USA, Australia, and Europe. The research has been shared with audiences through its inclusion in public events, through broadcast on the BBC World Service, and via the internet. The cultural impact of this shared sense of connectivity, spread through events such as the \#IPlay4Peace concert, have been significant at a time when isolation has become the ‘new normal’, and performing music together has seemed too challenging.Impact on MusiciansThe masterclass held by the Hebrides Ensemble and the composer James MacMillan was the first application of this technology for this purpose in the UK by a commercial ensemble \[C1\]. Kate Whitlock, General Manager of the Ensemble described the collaboration with the University as having ‘ *really a huge impact on the direction of the Ensemble’*. The event was attended by representatives from major arts organisations in Scotland. Fiona MacLennan, Carbon Reduction Project Manager of Creative Carbon Scotland, who attended this masterclass, described it as ‘ *having significant potential for helping artists based in locations which are remote from each to work together with high quality visual and audio communication*’ \[C2\]. 

###  The industry stakeholders group consultation, during ENU’s AHRC ENSEMBLE project \[O4\], selected the 2018 \#IPlay4Peace Armistice Centenary concert as the primary vehicle to test the next phase in international networked performance. The resulting concert involved 40 countries \[C3\] and received a House of Commons Motion to Congratulate from the Rt. Hon. Frank Field MP \[C4\]. The concert, which was streamed live currently has over 1,700 views on YouTube, and the edited video has been viewed 926 times \[C3\]. Neil MacLennan, who led the project, described the ENU team’s input as ‘ *truly outstanding*’ and attributed the success of bringing so many musicians together at the same time to the support of the team, which led to the project being repeated in 2019 and 2020 \[C3\]. 

###  The success of the Armistice project led Paul Gudgin, artistic director of the Durham Brass Festival 2016\-19, to approach the project team to facilitate a ‘Global Brass’ concert and ‘Global Jam Session’, including musicians performing live in the Gala Theatre, Durham, joined virtually from Copenhagen for paying audiences in both sites. Gudgin described this event as hopefully  ‘ *spawning lots of other collaborations, whether in brass, jazz, classical or rock and pop’*. Tony Thompson, from the Festival’s steering committee, suggested that this was a world first in terms 

###  of brass bands \[C5\].In August 2019, the BBC commissioned an 18<sup>th</sup> birthday special episode of ‘Digital Planet’, broadcast live on the BBC World Service on the 3<sup>rd</sup> September 2019, which connected the BBC Radio Theatre to studios at ENU so that musicians Andrew and Callum Huggan could perform together. Callum Huggan, Professor of Marimba and Percussion at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance said that the LoLa technology ‘ *allows for the tangible atmosphere of being in the same room to be so realistic’* and observed that the technology ‘ *allows us to be closer together than we would be in an orchestra*’. The presenter Bill Thompson observed the ‘ *sense of presence that comes from having no lag at all*’ in the duet. Andrew Huggan said that he forgot ‘ *that the link is there*’ and that he could see the technology ‘ *having a real purpose for rehearsal purposes for travelling musicians*’, saving a lot of travel \[C6\].Infrastructure ImpactWork funded by and in collaboration with Jisc \(formerly JANET\) \[O3\] has provided a showcase for both LoLa and the UK’s academic network at the launch of JANET6 and the 2018 and 2019 Jisc Digifest edtech conferences. The implementation of a multi\-person immersive dome environment \(IDE\) on stage with an orchestra from the Royal College of Music allowed performers to appear virtually broadcast from Edinburgh. Ben Hutchens, a training consultant for Pearson’s higher education digital resources, describes the performance as ‘ *amazing*’, and that ‘ *Words can’t describe how powerful the message was’*. Dominic Pates, Senior Educational Technologist at City, University of London, described the performance as ‘ *Impressive stuff that demonstrated some of the potential of the Internet for higher education’* \[C7\]. This close involvement of the team with academic network infrastructure has led to them advising fourteen institutions in the use of the technology, and directly supporting the first trials at the Royal Academy of Music, London, the Royal Scottish Conservatoire, Glasgow, and the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. From 2019\-20, Ferguson was invited to be a member of the UK5G Creative Industries Working Group, providing policy recommendations into the UK Government’s DCMS 5G Programme \[C8\] as a direct result of his work on this project and with applications in the commercial world of sound production.Sound production and recording industryThe Rogue Orchestra, Scotland’s first\-freelance cross\-genre session orchestra, have approached the team with a view to creating a competitive UK remote recording orchestra for music and film projects by international clients. Positive market research has led to feasibility testing for projects by PP Arnold and Paul Weller \[G2\]. Focusrite \(world leading audio interface builders\), Resurface \(‘ *the world\-wide marketplace for companies and individuals using professional audio mixing technologies’*\) and the technical team at Abbey Road Studios, London, regard the keynote performance given by the Radio Science Orchestra led by Bruce Wooley, with Matan Berkowitz and Harry Docherty, live in both the University of West London and ENU \[O6\] as a key moment for networked audio and remote sessions. For Focusrite, the idea that every piece of technology employed ‘ *was a current, off\-the shelf software or hardware product’* was particularly remarkable \[C9\].Recent work by the team has relied upon hardware from Audinate, manufacturers of Dante, ‘ *the leading AV\-over\-IP solution in the world*’. Audinate have invited Ferguson to give online webinars explaining his approaches to using ‘Dante over Distance’ which has been viewed by significant number of professional audio engineers, leading to significant reach within the industry \[C10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Drever’s influential concept of ‘auraldiversity’ arises from his work as a creative practitioner and theorist in soundscape composition, and the insight that notional standards of hearing in that area did not reflect the true diversity of people’s aural capacities. Further investigation showed that the same held in wider society: International Standards and practices around sound and noise – especially as they have pertained to technology, and the design of place – envisaged and serviced an ideal hearing subject whose profile is based on long out\-of\-date assumptions. This can drastically diminish quality of life for those whose hearing renders them sensitive or vulnerable. Drever has worked to transform this situation through creative practice, public engagement activities, consultancy and policy work, and pedagogy. He has impacted the ways that members of the public, architects, designers, charities, future acoustics professionals and those writing International Standards understand and organise our diverse relationships with the acoustic environment. Drever’s auraldiversity research thus shows how an arts practice can lead to significant social change. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 At the heart of Drever’s recent research \(2017 \[a\]; 2020 \[a\]\) is a critical address of the ‘auraltypical’ subject whose hearing – based on studies and thresholds set generations ago – does not reflect the true diversity of aural experiences. This model originated from the ‘Acoustics – Normal Equal\-Loudness\-Level Contours ISO 226:2003,’ from which A\-weighted decibels are derived. Benchmarks made according to this International Standard can be found in the majority of acoustics regulation and practice across the world: building and planning, noise at work, aircraft noise, and so on. 

 The equal\-loudness\-level contour \(developed by Fletcher and Munson in 1933; refined in 1956 and 2003\), establishes what Drever sees as an idealised hearing subject: its measurement requires a test subject between 18\-25 years old, ‘in a normal state of health who is free from all signs or symptoms of ear disease and from obstructing wax in the ear canals, and who has no history of undue exposure to noise, exposure to potentially ototoxic drugs or familial hearing loss’ \(ISO 226:2003\). Thus, the equal\-loudness\-level contour, and the benchmarking for ‘safe’ levels of noise in everyday life that result from it, envisage and serve only an idealised, normative demographic group. Drever has coined the provocative term ‘auraltypical’ to refer to this supposedly ‘normal’ hearer. 

 However, accompanying auraltypical hearing is the actual variety of \(often less than ideal\) hearing that we experience throughout a normal day and throughout our lives, from the trifling experience of a temporary threshold shift or transient ear noise, to the intolerable pain of hyperacusis. This reality is what Drever calls ‘auraldiversity’. Drever \(2017\[a\]\) offers numerous case studies to demonstrate the ways in which people’s lives are disrupted by notionally ‘safe’ sounds which are experienced as painful, anxiety\- or depression\-inducing. For those chronically affected, these acoustic norms perpetuate a ‘social model of disability’: ‘what makes a \[person\] disabled’, Drever writes \(2017\[a\]\), ‘is not their medical condition, but the attitudes and structures of society’ that reinforce their disadvantage. Drever argues that by adopting a more diverse and inclusive approach, designers and policy\-makers can improve the wellbeing of a heterogeneous and ageing population. 

 This research builds on Drever’s longstanding interest in the relationship between listening subjects and their acoustic environments. He has explored these issues through creative and theoretical work focused on two sonic arts practices: the soundwalk, and field\-recording centred composition. Drever \(2009; 2020 \[b\]\) theorises the soundwalk as a method through which participants – specialist or non, of ‘normal’ hearing or otherwise – may gain insight into place, or transform extant and intimate knowledge of it, by way of a range of situated listening strategies. Meanwhile, Drever \(2017 \[b\]\) stages the history and practice of field recording\-centred composition as a dense web of traditions and disciplinary norms that becomes more complex as it is obliged to manage an ever\-increasing and overlapping litany of contexts: place, heritage, urban design, accessibility, environmental noise, sustainability and ecological engagement from the perspective of sound and listening. Drever explores the tensions between the compositional mechanics of organising sound, and the apparent sociality of field recording material, arguing that artists are not *de facto* more socially sensitive or ethically minded by virtue of carrying out field recording. Drever’s creative work \(as collected in 2020 \[a\]\) aims to address these issues by replacing sonic arts composition’s usual, ‘auraltypical’ presumptions with a fully auraldiverse approach. The performances ‘Ayre \#2 \[Dan Dryer\]’ \(2016\), a site\-specific installation featuring 98 different voices including those of infants and people in their 80s, and ‘Ayre \# 3’ \(2019\), a live work for 6 performers, are participatory and inclusive, placing the performers’ hearing at the centre of the creative process.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Drever’s work on auraldiversity is evident on both local and large scales: his work has changed the thinking and activities of professionals and members of the public, and has contributed to the development of new International Standards around sound and the environment. 

 **Professionals:** For arts’ acoustics, urbanism and broadcasting professionals, Drever is a leading authority on this subject. People working in those fields have made use of Drever’s thinking on auraldiversity in diverse organisational enterprises, training sessions, and broadcasting. 

 In 2018, Drever’s work inspired composer Andrew Hugill to found the research project, auraldiversity.org. The project hosts events for acoustics professionals, as well as public concerts. Its mission statement states: ‘“auraldiversity” was coined by John Levack Drever \[...\] The Aural Diversity project applies this idea to music, the sonic arts, environmental design, audiology, hearing aid design and other related areas’ \[S1\]. The project has significantly enhanced professional engagement with auraldiverse experiences, as evidenced by the GBP20,000 developmental grant awarded to the project by hearing\-aid manufacturer, GNResound. \(Project user feedback is detailed under ‘Publics’\). 

 Drever has worked with urban planners, placemakers, civic designers and architects to increase awareness of, and implement critical thinking practices concerning, the acoustic environment. Drever is a member of the Academy of Urbanism, where his activities have helped demonstrate the importance of auraldiverse approaches to place\-making professionals. Notably, he introduced and conducted acoustic assessments for the Academy’s influential Great Place Award. Stephen Gallagher, the Academy’s Director of Engagement, writes: ‘Drever has raised awareness among the Academy and its built environment experts of the often\-overlooked importance of sound in the places we inhabit. Through his own endeavours, Prof. Drever has used his expertise on the subject to enrich our analysis of good places, which we do through The Urbanism Awards, by adding acoustic ecology as a completely new dimension to our reporting’ \[S2\]. 

 Drever regularly devises and leads soundwalks for external professional gatherings and organisations \(for example the 24<sup>th</sup> International Congress of Sound and Vibration, London, and Young Urbanists, both 2017\). He also acts as advocate of the practice in professional and other public contexts, as with his keynote ‘The Role of Improvisation in Auraldiverse Soundwalking’, given at the 2018 conference *Space, Sound and the Improvisatory: Methods, Technologies and Theories for Improvising with Natural and Built Environments*, at the Onassis Stegi, Athens, or by way of the soundwalk resources he has developed for external bodies, like the open access *DIY Primer for Soundwalking* for the Museum of Walking \(2017\). These resources enable special interest groups to approach their work differently by offering methods to explore the sonic and social characteristics of an environment. 

 Drever also has an ongoing association with the acoustics consultancy Anderson Acoustics, with which he has participated in numerous public events and a redevelopment project in the London borough of Newham. Drever’s work has shaped the company’s work beyond those collaborations. Company Director John Newman writes: ‘\[Drever’s\] work has directly helped develop and guide Anderson Acoustics’ Soundscapes and Tranquillity Practice. It is helping society understand the value of soundscapes as environmental capital and promoting it within the built environment agenda for sustainability, health and wellbeing’ \[S3\]. 

 Drever is frequently recruited by media companies and producers who wish to explore issues concerning the sonic environment. He was employed by Grapevine Digital as an acoustics expert as part of the release campaign for the film, *A Quiet Place*. In press interviews, which took place across the digital news platforms, iNews, Vice and Yahoo, Drever articulated a critical approach to the idea of silence, and its supposed desirability. Drever also contributed to monocle.com’s radio show, ‘The Urbanist’ \(2015\), discussing soundscapes and urban ecology, and to two Radio 4 segments produced by David Sillito \(2018\). Sillito writes: ‘\[Drever\] and I have managed to push the issue of sound in to some of the prime slots on the Today Programme. It was radio that provoked thought, surprise and delight and above all sounded wonderful’. Speaking on\-air of Drever’s Radio 3 ‘Music Matters’ interview \(2019\), presenter Tom Service called auraldiversity ‘just about the most transformative idea you could possibly imagine’ \[S4\]. 

 **Pedagogy:** Drever’s teaching has helped shape the careers of younger colleagues who are now further developing their own approaches to auraldiverse theory and practice. 

 The Academy of Urbanism’s Stephen Gallagher writes that ‘John has been keen to inspire the next generation of experts on the subject, through “Sound Walk” events aimed at the Academy’s Young Urbanist network’ \[S2\]. Drever’s students at Goldsmiths and other universities have been similarly inspired. The charity Theatrum Mundi, which brings together architects, planners, engineers, and urbanists to improve the understanding of cities and their design, is directed by former student John Bingham\-Hall. The charity’s Sonic Urbanism programme, which explores ‘how acoustics structure social life’, reflects Bingham\-Hall’s undergraduate study with Drever in 2008\-9. Bingham\-Hall writes that Drever’s ‘creative and academic work on urban soundscapes opened up a new set of ideas for me about what music study could mean’, and gave him interests that ‘enabled me now to lead … Theatrum Mundi’ \[S5\]. Drever is committed to coupling graduate training and social impact, and in 2018 secured a CHASE/AHRC doctoral award in collaboration with Goldsmiths and the Noise Abatement Society, for a PhD project titled ‘Liveable Listenable Cities: Human\-Centred Planning and Appraisal of Applied Soundscape Design for an Auraldiverse Population.’ Drever’s sustained commitment to teaching, and his ability to inspire among his students both creative thinking and practical action, are a central component in the continuing impact and enrichment of auraldiverse approaches across society. 

 **Publics:** Owing to the broad relevance of his thinking, and his ability to communicate ideas to general audiences, Drever is frequently invited to give talks, produce events and design educational activities for diverse publics. These explore multifaceted approaches to issues of sound, diversity, and wellbeing within the acoustic environment. 

 Drever has given over a dozen public talks since 2015, including a Royal Society of Arts Talk on the future of urban sound\-planning \(2017\), and a series of nationwide lectures as part of Sound Affects \(2018\), a series organised by the Clod Ensemble that culminated with an event at the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. Drever also addresses smaller, special\-interest groups. Unsolicited feedback from the secretary of the Quaggy Waterways Action Group exemplifies the ways in which Drever’s public lectures inspire new kinds of awareness and thinking: ‘\[I\] noticed your voice had a slight resonance in the room which you had mentioned. I realised in that moment we have our own personal “soundscape” \[...\] Your talk was very thought provoking and stimulating’ \[S6\]. The group extended an invitation to discuss further the ideas generated, and their future application to waterways conservation work. 

 In 2018\-19, the auraldiversity.org project \(described above\) hosted a series of inclusive public concerts exploring how a consideration of auraldiversity might reshape music performance and listening practices. Attendees were encouraged to move around freely, and to experiment with different modes of engagement. Anonymous questionnaire feedback conveys the impact these auraldiverse approaches had on concert attendees: one, who attended having seen the concert advertised in the Attenborough Arts Centre \(Leicester\) brochure, described it as ‘\[a\] great evening that really made me think about different ways of listening and the importance to me of sounds and soundscapes.’ Another, who lives with hearing loss, said with ‘the diversity of listening modes \[...\] I don't feel hearing impaired. I feel like I can listen better than ever’ \[S7\]. 

 **Policy:** Drever has been an important contributor to several projects that have impacted on the development of new International Standards \(‘ISOs’\) around soundscape. These Standards have been designed to ameliorate people’s diverse experience of their acoustic environment. Drever’s work around BS ISO 12913\-1:2014 contributed to the term ‘soundscape’ becoming formally recognised in acoustics and planning. The term is referenced in the award\-winning revision of Professional Practice Guidance on Planning and Noise, ProPG \(Institute of Acoustics, 2017\). This Guidance aims ‘to provide practitioners with an industry\-recommended approach \[...\] advocat\[ing\] full consideration of the acoustic environment through state\-of\-the\-art design principles’ \[S8\]. 

 Drever has developed a sustained collaborative relationship with the Noise Abatement Society \(NAS\), whose Managing Director, Lisa Lavia, has been a central figure in the development of new ISOs around soundscape since 2010. Lavia writes that Drever’s work ‘has provided the NAS with valuable insights and support to make these concepts more widely known and better understood to new audiences, namely policy makers, the public and practitioners. This has been extremely important in helping the NAS to extend its impact and achieve support for its work helping to develop the International Soundscape Standard series \(ISO 12913\-1:2014; ISO/TS 12913\-2:2018; ISO/TS 12913\-3:2019\), and numerous action research projects’ \[S9\]. 

 Max Dixon is one of the world’s leading town planning, urban regeneration and environmental analysis experts. Assessing Drever’s contribution to recent professional discourse around the acoustic environment, he writes: ‘Drever’s many contributions to cross\-disciplinary workshops, conferences and other events have had significant practical influences on the evolution of public policy and services, both across the UK and internationally ... \[H\]is theory and practice in the fields of open space soundscapes and soundwalking have undoubtedly influenced developments in the analysis, design and management of public environments … Drever’s growing body of innovative work is an outstanding exemplar of how arts and cultural activity can both maintain its own integrity and independence while engaging productively with real world problems and stimulating evolution of new practical approaches in public policy and service delivery’ \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Aberystwyth University \(AU\) research and breeding programmes have generated highly persistent clover varieties. Increasing the use of these varieties in grassland agriculture provides economic and environmental benefits. The rhizomatous trait \(i.e. spreading via underground shoots\) from Caucasian clover was introduced into white clover through interspecific hybridisation to improve persistence under grazing and drought. The first such commercial white clover variety is AberLasting with 40t of seed being produced in 2017, and the demand is rapidly increasing. Persistent red clover varieties have been developed, notably AberClaret, which produces high yields in the third and fourth harvest years. It accounts for 15% of red clover seed sales in the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research and breeding of forage crops at Institute of Biological, Environmental & Rural Sciences \(IBERS\), AU is based on clear objectives and innovative routes to generate commercially successful forage crop varieties, supported by BBSRC, the Welsh Government and Innovate UK, and funded significantly by our strategic partner Germinal Holdings Ltd. \(the largest UK owned forage seed wholesale company\) \[3.8\- 3.11\]. White and red clover are two of the most important forage legumes for temperate sustainable livestock production systems. They can fix, on average, 150kg N/ha/yr, reducing the need for industrial nitrogen fertilizer. They produce high yields of good quality forage with a crude protein \(CP\) content of 18\-19% and improve soil structure and fertility. However, greater use in the UK has been limited by its lack of persistence in swards. Increasing persistency therefore, particularly in mixtures with grasses is an important breeding target. AberLasting \[3.1\] and AberClaret \[3.2\] are white and red clover varieties, respectively, which have been developed at IBERS with this goal in mind. 

####  **AberLasting** 

 Research at IBERS underpinned the breeding of novel white clover varieties derived from introgression of the rhizomatous trait from Caucasian clover \( *T.ambiguum* M. Bieb\) as a route to improving drought tolerance of white clover and persistence under grazing \[3.3\]. A programme of hybridisation and backcrossing to the white clover parent produced hybrids that are white clover\-like in appearance, but which incorporate the rhizomatous growth habit. This research was carried out by Abberton, Marshall and Collins, and has delivered selection tools facilitating development of novel germplasm and its successful inclusion into the IBERS white clover breeding programme \[3.4\]. The first variety from the programme, AberLasting, was added to the UK National List in 2016, and is now in trials and commercial production. 

 Field experiments demonstrated that improved resilience to drought and frost compared to white clover was attained without compromising dry matter yield and forage quality, partly due to a greater root biomass at depth \[3.5\]. This genetic material is now included in the IBERS white clover breeding programme enabling the rhizomatous trait to be introduced into a range of recipient types to further improve grazing tolerance \[3.6\]. 

####  **AberClaret** 

 Under typical UK silage management, red clover tends to persist for 2\-3 harvest years, after which yields decline. Therefore, increased persistence is a major breeding target to achieve high biomass yield beyond the third year. IBERS research had already established that morphological trait variation for crown diameter and growth habit influenced mortality rates of red clover, and subsequently IBERS initiated a breeding programme to improve persistency utilising recurrent selection starting with short\-lived elite germplasm. 

 Persistent populations with high biomass yield continuing in the third and fourth harvest year led to the development of the AberClaret variety. AberClaret gave the highest dry matter yield in mixed swards in Year 4 \(61%\) in an experiment comparing 12 red clover varieties \[3.7\]. This resulted in greater CP yields on an area basis, highlighting the importance of red clover persistence to the feeding value of grass/red clover swards.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

####  **Economic and commercial impact** 

 Seed of the IBERS bred clover varieties is marketed through a strategic alliance between IBERS and Germinal Holdings Ltd. 40t of seed of ‘AberLasting’ was produced in New Zealand in 2017, with a further 40t produced in 2019. Demand is increasing as the variety is very popular in New Zealand \[5.1.1\- 4\], and seed is returned to the UK for inclusion in Germinal mixtures \[5.1.5\], such as AberSheep \[5.1.6\]. Germinal seed sales in tons are shown in Figure 1. \[5.2.1\] Trials are taking place in Japan, France and other countries. It is anticipated that in the future, seed of this and other varieties developed from this germplasm will be sold in many European countries. 



 Figure 1: Annual Germinal seed sales by country \[tons\] 

 Germinal annual seed sales of AberClaret was 34.4t in the UK \(approximately 15% of the UK market in 2017\), 20t in Switzerland and further expansion into other overseas markets including New Zealand, Australia and Canada. The England and Wales Recommended List shows that among diploid varieties, AberClaret had the second highest yield in the second and third harvest years, with a score of 106% and 111%, respectively \[5.2.2\]. Its high biomass yield, even in the fourth year, translates to approximately 2t CP/ha/yr, increases the nutritional quality of the silage, and persistence for the duration of many medium\-term leys \[5.3\]. At the farm level this equals a saving of GBP700 on imported soybean meal. Assuming a price of GBP350 per t, worth up to GBP7,000,000 for 10,000ha. Growth rates of 1.3kg/head/day \(growing ration\) and 1.5 kg/head/day \(finishing\) in beef cattle are being achieved, with no oil seed rape meal or soya required when red clover silage is available \[5.4\]. 

  

####  **Societal and environmental benefit** 

 White clover fixes approximately 150kg N/ha/yr some of which is utilised by the companion grass, providing an economic and environmental benefit to the farmer and society by reducing the need to apply mineral nitrogen fertiliser. White clover breeding programmes have focused on ensuring that the proportion of white clover in a sward is sufficiently persistent to be maintained at an optimal 30% in mixtures with grass. Such mixtures require 300 to 400kg N/ha/yr less N fertiliser compared to grass monocultures to achieve the same yield. This reduction in fertiliser application reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by approximately 1t/ha/yr \[5.5\], and provide a saving of GBP70 per ha for the farmer, assuming a cost of approximately GBP200 per t N. Furthermore, application of nitrogenous fertilisers accounts for the majority of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. For every 100kg of fertiliser N added to the soil, on average 1kg of N is emitted as N<sub>2</sub>O, which is equivalent to approximately 600kg of CO<sub>2</sub> \[5.6\]. 

 Red clover contains high levels of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase which has beneficial effects on nitrogen utilisation in ruminants. It is also an excellent break crop allowing soil fertility to build up, and reducing weed problems, particularly blackgrass in cereal crops. 

 In addition to N\-fixation, soil fertility and structure, clovers reduce the need for reseeding as they remain productive for 5 or 6 years, even under heavy abiotic stress. They continue to grow during drought periods in contrast to grass and provide more tangible benefits to the environment in terms of food and habitat for insect pollinators, thus maintaining the biodiversity in grasslands. \[5.4\]

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Queen Mary’s follow up results of the IBIS\-I trial, published in 2007 and 2015, demonstrated that for women at increased breast cancer risk, taking tamoxifen for five years has a 20\-year preventive effect. Thus, since August 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society, and the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network have recommended prophylactic tamoxifen for women at increased breast cancer risk, numbering over 7,000,000. In Australia, tamoxifen was licenced for breast cancer prevention in 2016, and was added to the Australian Government’s pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as a result of which an estimated 250,000 women will directly benefit. In April 2018, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approved the use of tamoxifen in the primary prevention of breast cancer in women at moderate or high risk. In England and Wales this amounts to approximately 500,000 women. A five\-year preventive treatment course of tamoxifen costs approximately GBP130. By contrast, the treatment for breast cancer per patient can cost GBP12,000 per year.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As the incidence of breast cancer continues to rise \(an estimated 1,600,000 cases now occur worldwide each year\), research is focussing on prevention for women at increased risk. Prior to 2002, several studies of the prophylactic utility of the selective oestrogen receptor modulator \(SERM\) drug, tamoxifen, had produced mixed results, and opinion was divided on the risk to benefit ratio. In the two follow up studies to the Queen Mary led the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study \(IBIS\-I\) trial, published in 2007 and 2015, Prof. Cuzick, as lead investigator in the IBIS\-I, demonstrated that for women at increased risk, tamoxifen taken for five years has a continuing preventive effect for 20 years. 

 In the original IBIS\-I double\-blind randomised placebo controlled trial of tamoxifen, 7,154 women considered to be at increased risk of breast cancer were allocated to five years of either tamoxifen, or placebo. The first published results in 2002 showed that after a median follow\-up of 50 months, there was an observed 32% risk reduction, but the overall risk to benefit ratio remained unclear. At median eight years of follow\-up, the long term results reported in 2007 \[3.1\] showed that the risk reducing effects of tamoxifen appeared to persist for at least ten years. This study also presented the first randomised evidence that while the benefits of tamoxifen extend beyond the treatment period, the side effects largely did not. 

 A 2013 meta\-analysis of all SERM prevention trials \[3.2\] confirmed the preventive efficacy of these drugs. In the extended long term IBIS\-I follow up \(median 16 years\) published in 2015 \[3.3\], it was found that the preventive effect of five years of tamoxifen treatment remained similar, and persisted, throughout the 20\-year period. Reductions were recorded for invasive oestrogen receptor positive cancers and ductal carcinoma in situ, but not for invasive oestrogen receptor negative cases. Tamoxifen was shown to offer a very long period of protection after treatment cessation, and therefore the benefit to harm ratio of tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention was substantially improved. 

 Cuzick and his team have subsequently published additional research on tamoxifen in breast cancer prevention, including: 

-  An assessment of uptake \[3.4\] 

-  A comparison of results with a second trial to help identify more women who would benefit from the treatment and to investigate the effect of  adding a polygenic risk score to refine the risk models \[3.5\] 

-  And a study of attitudes among general practitioners to prescribing tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention and the potential benefit of initiating prescriptions for preventive therapy in secondary rather than primary care \[3.6\]. 

 Thus, Queen Mary’s research has demonstrated that for women at increased breast cancer risk, taking tamoxifen for five years has a 20\-year preventive effect and that tamoxifen should, therefore, be considered for long\-term preventive treatment.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Queen Mary’s research has enabled access to tamoxifen as a long\-term preventive treatment for breast cancer for women at increased risk. This has been achieved through influencing international clinical guidelines and providing evidence that has facilitated approval for this new use of tamoxifen. 

  

#  Informing clinical guidelines in the US 

 Over 7,000,000 women in the US \(approximately 10% of the female population aged 35 or older\) fall into the ‘high risk’ category for breast cancer. Using tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer among women aged 55 and younger with a 5\-year risk of ≥1.66% will prevent 29 cases and 9 breast cancer deaths, and save USD47,580 per 1,000 women treated \[5.1\]. 

 Recommendations regarding tamoxifen for preventive use changed after publication of the IBIS\-I long term follow up results \[3.1, 3.2\]. The US Preventive Services Task Force, in September 2013, reviewed IBIS\-I \[3.1\] as part of the evidence for offering risk reducing SERMs such as tamoxifen and recommended offering them to asymptomatic women aged 35 or older without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ, but who are at increased risk of breast cancer \[5.2\]. The American Cancer Society also altered its guidelines, referencing \[3.2\] to note that tamoxifen has been shown to lower breast cancer risk \[5.3\]. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) guidelines of 2017 referenced Prof. Cuzick’s work on chemoprevention \[3.2\] and recommend that women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be evaluated for preventive treatment \[5.4\]. The NCCN used Cuzick’s work \[3.1, 3.3\] as part of the evidence base for their recommendation that tamoxifen is used as an option for pre\- and post\-menopausal women aged 35 or older with a life expectancy of 10 years or more, who are at increased risk for breast cancer \(generally those with ≥1.7% 5\-year risk for breast cancer using the Gail model\) \[5.5\]. 

#  Informing clinical guidelines in Australia 

 Based on the IBIS\-I and other clinical trials, in April 2016, Nolvadex \[5.6\] \(tamoxifen\) was approved with an “extension of indication” by the Australian Government’s Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration. It announced that Nolvadex was now indicated for the primary reduction of breast cancer risk in women either at moderately increased risk \(lifetime breast cancer risk 1.5 to 3 times the population average\) or high risk \(lifetime breast cancer risk greater than 3 times the population average\) \[5.7\]. Tamoxifen for women at increased risk of breast cancer was then added to the Australian Government’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme \(PBS\) \[5.8\]. The National Breast Cancer Foundation’s press coverage of this development noted that this change in policy was a result of the IBIS\-I trial evidence, which it was “proud” to have funded \[5.9\]. 

 With the approval of tamoxifen as a preventive measure on PBS, an estimated 250,000 women with a family history or a genetic predisposition to breast cancer will benefit. Australian women deemed at moderate\-to\-high high risk of developing breast cancer have access to subsidised tamoxifen \(AUD36 per script\) to reduce their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, which will, in turn, reduce costs to the health system \[5.9\]. 

#  Facilitating approval for preventive use of tamoxifen in the UK 

 In April 2018, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approved the use of tamoxifen in the primary prevention of breast cancer in women at moderate or high risk in the UK and the Cuzick team’s meta\-analysis and IBIS\-I papers \[3.1\-3.3\] were the “pivotal” publications for the clinical efficacy conclusions made \[5.10\]. 

 In the UK, around 3.7% of the female population aged 35\-74 have a moderate or high risk \[5.11\]. In England and Wales this is around 500,000 women. A five\-year preventive treatment course of tamoxifen costs about GBP130. By contrast, the treatment of breast cancer per patient can cost GBP12,000 per year \[5.12\]. 

 The NHS Accelerated Access Collaborative has named tamoxifen, as a provision to women at risk of developing breast cancer, as one of four new innovations to be addressed in its 2020\-21 Rapid Uptake Product Programme. The programme supports stronger adoption and spread of proven innovations for products that support the key clinical priorities of the NHS Long Term Plan, and will work to improve patient care and outcomes by more effectively providing tamoxifen to women who are at risk \[5.13\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research in the Department of Chemistry, at the University of Cambridge, into supramolecular assembly of microcapsules using cucurbiturils led to the spin\-out company Aqdot. Aqdot has developed a range of products based on the cucurbituril encapsulation technology. Oderase is a unique odour\-erasing household product sold by Ocado, and Acticote is an agrochemical product used throughout Europe to increase crop yield. Aqdot currently \[text redacted for publication\] employs 26 staff. The technology has been scaled up to multi\-tonne capability for incorporation into plastics, sanitary, air purification, cosmetics and food products.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The early proof\-of\-concept experiments on microcapsule self\-assembly that led to the spin\-out company Aqdot took place in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge in laboratories led by Professor Oren Scherman and Professor Chris Abell. The Scherman group has a long\-standing interest in supramolecular polymer chemistry. The Abell group is interested in the development of new applications of microfluidics in chemistry, biology and materials science. 

 **Microcapsules.** In 2010, there was a growing interest in synthetic microcapsules, because bespoke design of the size, shell structure and core contents would allow tailoring to specific applications, such as drug delivery, cell encapsulation or food additives.  However, the existing methods, such as the layer\-by\-layer technique or colloidal emulsion\-templating, suffered from poor stability, encapsulation and loading efficiencies, as well as heterogeneity in microcapsule composition and dispersion.  Hence the industry faced a challenge in achieving efficient, scalable production of microcapsules with uncompromised functionality. 

 **The supramolecular approach.** Professor Scherman had been studying the formation of termolecular complexes between a macrocyclic host \(cucurbituril or CB\[8\]\) and two guests, methyl viologen and naphthalene. Together with the Abell laboratory, they showed that it was possible to use CB\[8\] at an oil\-water interface to form cross\-linked networks between gold nanoparticles functionalised with methyl viologen and polymers functionalised with naphthalene. This system provided the basis for a one\-step approach to generate porous microcapsules with customisable functionality by implementing the host–guest chemistry in microfluidic droplets.\[R1\] The supramolecular approach offered opportunities for variation in properties through selection of different host–guest combinations, and chemical reduction of the methyl viologen guest could provide the on\-demand release of cargo. Moreover, the capsules were stable, heat resistant and highly monodisperse \(60 μm diameter\). In 2012, the scope of the approach was expanded further by fabricating supramolecular polymer microcapsules without the need for gold nanoparticles, instead relying on self\-assembly driven by electrostatic interactions.\[R2\] Subsequently, the hierarchical assembly of amphiphilic copolymers on the molecular, submicron and micron scale was realised, allowing the formation of hollow, uniformly\-sized supramolecular microcapsules. These microcapsules could be loaded with two different incompatible cargoes, i.e. a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic compound, and the contents could be released in controlled manner.\[R3\] 

 **Exploitation.** Realising the potential of their discoveries, Professors Abell and Scherman patented the key technology.\[R4–R6\] In 2012, they founded Aqdot Limited to exploit the new supramolecular approach to microcapsule fabrication. The Chief Scientific Officer is Dr Roger Coulston, the post\-doctoral research associate who worked in the Scherman group on the project, and the Marketing Director is Dr Jing Zhang, the PhD student who worked in Abell lab on the project.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Aqdot Limited.** The company was spun out as a platform technology company to develop commercial opportunities using the supramolecular microcapsules developed in the Abell and Scherman laboratories for applications in the food, cosmetics, textile, pharmaceuticals and agrochemical industries.\[E1\] In 2018, the global microencapsulation market size was valued at USD7,880,000,000 with an annual growth rate of 13.7%,\[E2\] so Aqdot’s novel approach to microencapsulation led to three successful rounds of venture capital funding, raising GBP2,550,000 in 2014, GBP5,000,000 in 2016, and GBP6,000,000 in 2019.\[E3\] Due to the potential environmental benefit of the technology, Aqdot has also received substantial support from Climate\-KIC, the EU's main climate innovation initiative.\[E3\] The company is currently located at Iconix Park in Cambridge, \[text redacted for publication\], and employs 26 staff.\[E4\] Aqdot has grown into a unique supramolecular chemistry company with a focus on developing, licensing and selling novel proprietary products based on cucurbituril encapsulation technology across multiple industrial sectors. Professors Scherman and Abell are both members of the Scientific Advisory Board, which is chaired by Abell.\[E1\] 

 **AqBit encapsulation technology.** Aqdot is working in partnership with a number of companies to develop bespoke applications of their cucurbituril encapsulation technology, which they have branded AqBit. The key component of AqBit is currently manufactured on the multi\-tonne scale by Aqdot. AqBit completed REACH registration without hazard labelling or environmental classification and has achieved a platinum level Material Health Certificate, which is the highest possible certification level under the Cradle to Cradle Certified product standards framework.\[E5\] The assessment is based on chemical hazard identification and qualitative exposure considerations during manufacture, use, and end\-of\-use. Cradle to Cradle certification guarantees that a material does not contain carcinogens, mutagens, reproductive toxicants, volatile organic compounds, or other harmful substances, and is therefore safe to use in a wide range of applications. 

 **AqFresh** is a product developed in collaboration with a leading aerospace air filtration company. AqBit technology provides a new solution for cabin air quality by capturing odour molecules and other volatile organic compounds that cannot be removed using current filter technologies.\[E6\] 

 **AqHealth** is another product currently being developed with one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies using AqBit for delivery of therapeutics for cancer.\[E7\] 

 **Oderase.** Aqdot has also launched its own branded products. Oderase is a fragrance\-free air freshener, which contains the AqBit technology and is available to consumers from Ocado.\[E8\] Oderase works through encapsulation of volatile organic compounds within cucurbiturils, and the difference between traditional air fresheners is that Oderase does not contain any fragrances or come in a pressurised aerosol, which has led to approval by Allergy UK and Good Housekeeping Institute.\[E6\] Oderase has also achieved platinum level Cradle to Cradle Certification.\[E9\] 

 **Tommee Tippee® nappy odour neutralising spray**. In 2020, Aqdot announced a major partnership with Mayborn Group, owner of the global baby brand Tommee Tippee. They have used AqBit to develop an odour neutralising product, which is being sold as a hand held spray as well as for use alongside the Tommee Tippee Twist & Click nappy disposal system, the current market leader in nappy bins.\[E10\] 

 **AqStar M1.** The use of cucurbituril\-mediated assembly of natural amphiphilic copolymers was commercialised by Aqdot as AqStar M1 in 2018. AqStar M1 is a cosmetic emulsifier that uses AqBit soft cross\-linking technology to boost the performance of natural starch with flexibility to create a wide variety of natural skin\-care formulations with distinctive aesthetics. AqStar M1 is currently distributed in the EU by Grolman and in the US by ChemSpec. Although AqStar M1 was only launched in 2018, it has already reached the consumer market.\[E11\] 

 **Acticote.** The product developed for the agrochemical market is Acticote, which is an adjuvant pod sealant for oilseed rape. Rape is the major EU oilseed crop \(17.5 megatonnes per annum worth USD15,000,000,000\), and the oil is widely used in the food industry, and to produce biodiesel. Acticote gives 18% yield increase in oilseed rape by reducing the incidence of pod shatter, and is currently being distributed throughout the EU by Intracrop.\[E7,E12\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our work relates to the annual 430 tibial fractures per million population that require surgical intervention: and the annual 1.1 million admissions within UK trauma and orthopaedics. Our research impacted patients, NHS, and other healthcare providers. Exemplar medical devices, that have achieved CE mark and/or Food & Drug Administration \(FDA\) clearance to market, demonstrate how our research has improved outcomes, enabled patients to return to normal activities sooner, and modified clinical practice. Market reach includes hospitals in 4 continents. We have influenced the profession though books and industrial articles, provided expert opinion for government, and supported ideas to market.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A multi\-disciplinary research team, comprising orthopaedic surgeons, nurses, engineers, medical device designers, statisticians, and industrialists from Keele, Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, and Royal Stoke University Hospital have developed computational models and performed patient\-focused studies to better understand how long bone fractures heal. A long bone fracture is rarely life threatening, although the outcome could be life changing for the patient. For example, unstable, complex and open lower leg fractures tend to have high complication rates and are often associated with potentially life changing limitations in function and with potential for chronic pain. We have examined how fractures heal, and in the process exposed how a better understanding of fractures can lead to development of new treatments and protocols to enhance healing and lead to improved outcomes. This research has been undertaken in collaboration with end users \(clinicians, patients and carers\), who informed the research and guided the subsequent development of new medical devices and corresponding surgical techniques. 

 *Exploring how fractures heal* 

 Continuous monitoring of fracture site movement and measurements of fracture stiffness have provided deeper insights into the relationship between mechanical stimulation and fracture healing, as well as exploring fracture healing assessment, and barriers to adoption \(3.1, 3.2 & 3.6\). This work contributed to a change in the norms associated with the outcomes of tibial fractures and developed new methods for the assessment of fracture healing. We determined that the rate at which a fracture site heals can be explained by a combination of fracture site motion and the remaining gap at the fracture site \- a measure of fracture reduction \(3.3 & 3.4\). This key finding was used as a primary assumption in our computer modelling of long bone fracture healing \(3.3\), using data gathered on the movement and stiffness of the fracture. Understanding the healing process enabled the development of engineering device solutions for fracture management, and the commercial realisation of these devices: IOS – a single\-use disposable external fixation system designed for the treatment of unstable tibial shaft fractures; and STORM \(the Staffordshire Orthopaedic Reduction Machine\) which is designed to help the orthopaedic surgeon to reduce an unstable lower leg fracture prior to fixation. 

 *Understanding existing treatments* 

 Biomechanical engineering methods were used to assess existing fracture treatments. In addition to work on long bone fractures, studies were performed on other complex fractures, such as transverse fractures of the patella \(3.5\). This work demonstrated that simple changes from the conventional principles of fixation, could optimise the compression of bone fragments needed for healing, whilst causing fewer failures and improving the stability of the construct. Arguably, pin site infection is one of the major barriers to widespread adoption of external fixation \(where pin sites are unavoidable\). Investigation of this complication \(3.1, 3.2, & 3.6\) led to the development of the METAclip, a unique universal clip for all external fixators, designed to create optimal pressure to hold dressings onto the skin.

 *Improving Outcomes through Improved Fracture Reduction* 

 Our research led to the development of an improved treatment pathway and new device to treat fractures – STORM. Used in the operating theatre \[5.1, 5.2\] STORM helps surgeons to reduce \(re\-align a fractured bone to its normal anatomical position\) and to hold the bone in place whilst selecting the best form of fixation \(method for holding in alignment whilst the bone heals\).  STORM has been independently \[5.2, 5.3\] demonstrated to shorten operating times, reduce x\-ray exposure, improve outcomes, and achieve a significant reduction in the incidence of malunions \[5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5\]. It is estimated that its use has saved between £1.6M \- £3M over the audit period through reduced operating theatre time and costs. In addition, by factoring the average incidence of malunion, an estimated £1\-2M in treatment and litigation costs has been saved over the audit period. 

 *Improving the Fracture Management Process* 

 IOS is a novel fracture fixation device which provides external fixation, once reduced, as above \[5.2\].  Patients treated with IOS \(who have previously been treated with other fixation methods\) stated a preference over previous treatments \[5.5, 5.7\]. Further, an audit conducted at the Royal Stoke Hospital demonstrated a significant reduction in healing times \(7\-8 weeks vs. 16 weeks using the “gold standard” Illizarov ring system\) \[5.4\].  Improved outcomes for patients include: ability to return to normal activity sooner \[5.1\]; reduction in the risk of malunion; 50% reduction in x\-rays over the healing period, and significantly less scaring than alternative fixation methods \[5.4\]. These improved patient outcomes result in cost savings for healthcare systems and governments through reduction in loss of earnings and productivity, reduction of repeat surgery \(malunions normally occur in approximately 10% of patients, a saving of circa £9,000 per patient – or £22.5 M per annum for the UK alone\), and reduction in the number of x\-rays and clinic time. 

 *Reducing the Incidence of Infection associated with fixation systems* 

 Pin\-site infection is a common complication of external fixation and has limited the adoption of external fixation. Our research has led to adoption of a pin\-site care pathway in NHS hospital protocols \[5.6\], and development of a new device, the METAclip. The care pathway has been presented at conferences and training sessions across the UK. The METAclip, has been influenced by both patient and clinical feedback and is sold in the UK and EU \[5.7\]. Its design allows the clinician to compress the dressing to an optimum level whilst avoiding pressure necrosis \[5.2\]. There is growing evidence that the use of our care pathway and device has reduced the incidence of pin site irritation and infection \[5.2\] and hence, a reduction in antibiotic use and associated treatment times \[5.2\]. It is also being widely used across the whole range of external fixation systems from mono\-lateral to ring fixation, and from tibia to pelvis to wrist \[5.2\]. 

 *Impact on health and health practitioners through improved protocols, techniques and training* 

 During the census period over 35,000 fractures and pin sites have been treated with the devices described above \[5.7\]. The devices, and the techniques they have introduced, are influencing the way practitioners approach the treatment of tibial fractures, in particular \[5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 & 5.6\]. Our pin site care pathway is now the basis for training most specialist fracture nurses across the UK and on any bone treated with external fixation \[5.6\]. Further, underpinning interdisciplinary research has generated significant know\-how and expertise. Medical Device Design \(now in its second edition\) is an established textbook for the teaching of medical device design and an essential guide for companies looking to take a new product idea from concept to market. This book has influenced over 38,000 medical devices practitioners \[5.8\]. 

 *Economic and Related Impacts* 

 Our three fracture management devices \(sold by METAPHYSIS LLP\) support employment and wealth creation in a supply chain that spans 8 other companies in 3 countries \[5.7\].  The devices have been used and adopted by the NHS and by other healthcare providers worldwide. The company now has products in use in hospitals across 9 countries and 4 continents \[5.7\]. Sales of STORM and IOS have increased, over the audit period, by 1,200%, with patient interventions by over 200% \[5.7\].  UK market penetration has also increased: in 2017, METACLIP sales were solely confined to the Royal Stoke hospital, but by 2020 they were in use at major hospitals across the UK, Rep of Ireland and Germany \[5.7\]. 

 In addition, expertise and know\-how from the underpinning research established the foundations of a medical innovation ecosystem in Staffordshire, which has led to the formation of a £2m EU funded programme of SME support, Business Bridge \[5.9\]. Since 2017, this programme has supported nearly 70 SMEs with healthcare and medical innovations, with 2 products achieving CE Mark in 2020. The programme has spawned a Healthcare Business Network of over 100 members.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Leisure\-based prescriptions in primary care \(‘social prescribing’\) for improving health & wellbeing are better understood, better implemented, and more widely commissioned as a result of our research.  Critically, objective and subjective patient benefits are repeatedly demonstrated from social prescribing care pathways fundamentally informed by our research.  An iterative action research and impact model is adopted, where the researchers are funded to be involved in the prescription care pathway design from the outset, with the evaluation informing future commissioning and evaluation approaches. The case study demonstrates impact from the end\-user up to the policy level. Programmes have adopted our evidence to enhance delivery and outcomes, and more national\-level implementation of social prescribing modalities in primary care have been supported by the evidence generated from the unit. Beyond, it has been included in international discussions regarding the use of social prescribing. The research has been funded by commissioners and a range of health trusts, public and third sector organisations. Ranging from the inclusion of social prescribing as part of the NHS Long Term Plan, to more local commissioning and practice advances, the impact now has national reach, with Gloucestershire internationally renowned as leading in this field of public health.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This social prescribing research builds on the international reputation and impact of the Unit’s research on exercise on prescription in the late 1990s and 2000s \(e.g., **8**\), and the subsequent research on health care pathways involving physical activity from 2010, to some of the earliest large\-scale observational studies of arts on prescription in the 21<sup>st</sup> century \(e.g., **6, 7**\).  More latterly, our reputation has drawn in other significant commissioners, including the Wildlife Trust health partnering for nature prescriptions, and Macmillan for cancer patient arts therapy. 

 Poor mental health is the second largest source of disease burden in England \(Public Health England, 2019\), and is associated with a variety of physical health indicators.  Poor mental health intersecting with physical health issues can also drive up the cost of healthcare spending per patient by as much as 50% \(NHS England Mental Health Taskforce, 2016\).  Over many years, our Unit’s expertise and track\-record in the application and impact of leisure\-based prescriptions in health has now placed us at the forefront of advancements in the growing social prescribing movement in primary care, with notable contribution to the July 2017 All\-Party Parliamentary Group Arts, Health & Wellbeing Inquiry Report. 

 A selection of research outputs are provided in section 3.  To quote from one of our testimonials, the convenor of the Arts, Health & Wellbeing special interest group of the Royal Society for Public Health, “ *I would say that nationally and probably internationally, the Artlift evaluation is regarded as a beacon in relation to the whole concept of social prescribing.  Certainly, I know that in the context of the recent training provision for link workers within the social prescribing initiative for England, the work of University of Gloucestershire has been flagged up as a very important source of evidence on the value of this kind of activity.  In a recent review of social prescribing, the authors reached the conclusion that, as yet, there is not very much published evidence on social prescribing aside from that produced by University of Gloucestershire.*”  Over five commissioned UK\-based funded research projects have led to these outputs, and outcomes have been presented both nationally and throughout the European Union.  The presented body of research dates back to 2009, showing the evolution of social prescribing research, and the growing interest in arts, wider wellbeing, and nature. 

 Adopting an iterative action learning and impact research model \(a genuinely non\-linear co\-production approach\), researchers were always funded to design the intervention as well as the evaluation, and then evaluation learning was fed into future commissions.  Learning was informed by objective and subjective patient outcomes and benefits, as well as pathway design factors.  Critical to commissioners was the overall efficacy and cost\-benefit implications.  Examples of learning included the potential to shorten the duration of these expensive interventions whilst maintaining the efficacy.  Similarly, better targeting of the interventions based on patient sociodemographic and medical history resulted from the research.  This combination of both process and outcome evaluation within a co\-production environment, resulted in rapid advances in funding, practice and patient benefit. 

 The body of research provides an authoritative evidence base that is routinely cited in national policy for social prescribing in primary care, including for the first time in the field prospective observational studies with large participant cohorts \(n=245 to 1297\) and drawing on epidemiologic quantitative analysis techniques \(e.g., **1**, **3**, **5**\).  This is novel in this field of research, with no other studies of this size or complexity.  To explore further the patients’ and other actors’ experiences and perspectives, a range of qualitative approaches have been adopted, drawing data from this large body of participants \(e.g., **2**, **4**\).  The combination of findings from all research approaches can sometimes reveal novel insight \(e.g., **2**\) that is not possible from the approaches in isolation. In particular, some of these findings have moved our work into the further contemporary areas of wider wellbeing \(given the social isolation dynamics, for example\) and nature \(given the uptake rates and overall efficacy for arts\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The recognition of the impact of the Unit’s research at a national level is exemplified by this quotation from the Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, Prof Helen Stokes\-Lampard in 2019:  “ *for me to be able to wholeheartedly encourage NHS England and Government to support initiatives – as time has gone on, the evidence base has widened considerably and you are an important part of that.  As a result of our combined efforts, this means that we now have Social Prescribing specifically mentioned within the NHS Long Term Plan for England and Social Prescribers are being funded as part of the 2019 GP Contract, a 5\-year settlement for the profession.  Thank you for your ongoing research and interest in this area and I look forward to reading more of your inputs in the coming years.*” 

 Furthermore, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Arts for Health inquiry report \(2017\) had a special whole page ‘exemplar of innovation in health’ based on the Gloucestershire model of arts commissioning for health, and the integration of research evaluation by the Unit from the outset \( **A**\).  The significant impact of the research is also evident from the WHO Report \( **B**\), What is the evidence on the role of the arts in improving health and well\-being? A scoping review \(Fancourt, D., & Finn, S., 2020\). This report shows the importance of the unit’s research in the emerging international focus of social prescribing, and its gaining momentum as a key source of support for patient health and wellbeing beyond the UK. 

 The research\-impact relationship is iterative, based on a co\-production model.  The commissioning of evaluation at the same time as care pathway design, leads to rapid implementation of evaluation findings, and subsequent benefits for future commissioning, and the patients and other actors.  On behalf of the Royal Society for Public Health, Arts, Health & Wellbeing Special Interest Group \( **C**\), the convenor, Prof Stephen Clift outlines the impact of the research.  “ *I have been impressed with the data collection for many reasons. The first is that the numbers of patients they have been able to follow has increased, and so it is in the order of several thousand now across the county.  Secondly, they have been able to gather information on different models of delivery to provide important evidence for practice.  They have also been able to look at different art forms, because Artlift offer different kinds of arts activity and some might suit some people better than others.  They have been very good making use of widely used validated standardised instruments for assessing wellbeing.  One of these is the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. They have recently been able to supplement that with more clinically oriented measures of anxiety and depression, again, showing positive results.  All of these studies have produced a solid evidence base that people clearly benefit from participation.  They have also been able to look at repeated cycles of referral.  This kind of re\-referral is a very important aspect of these kinds of projects and UoG’s work has been able to capture that.  The other thing I would say is very strong, is that UoG has also gathered a lot of qualitative feedback.  They have collated and analysed a lot of narrative accounts from people accessing these programmes, and it is very clear from what people have to say, that they have benefited.  This type of evidence gives greater insight into how these interventions work, what the kind of processes are that lead to benefits for people in terms of their wellbeing.*” 

 Clinical Lead for Social Prescribing at NHS Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group \( **D**\), Dr Simon Opher MBE, further exemplifies the co\-production model. “ *The evaluation was done as a co\-production as we developed the arts on prescription service*.”  In his testimonial, he also goes on to explain the national impact of the research conducted within Gloucestershire.  “ *On a national level, I think the research influenced people who were looking at new ways of working. The new reformed GP contract from the NHS, providing primary care networks with the ability to set up their own social prescribing schemes, partly came from the work in Arts and Health, and that work has been very much contributed to by work in Gloucestershire, so it definitely had a big impact nationally.*” 

 The significant impact of the research for Clinical Commissioning has been outlined by the Senior Programme Manager, Social Prescribing & Cultural Commissioning, Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group \( **E**\), Ms Jules Ford.  The Head of Public Health and Wellbeing, West Berkshire \(formerly Gloucestershire\) Clinical Commissioning Group \( **F**\), Mr Matthew Pearce, explains how integrated the research evaluation model has become, and how influential it is now beyond Gloucestershire.  The Executive Director, Artlift \( **G**\), Ms Cath Wilkins, also supports that national reach of the impact of the research, illustrating how Gloucestershire is now a leader in the field, and novel in the underpinning evidence to inform practice. 

 The impact to the end\-user is emphasised and made possible by the iterative action research and impact model adopted by the research team. Here, social prescribing programmes have been refined and improved through these iterative processes to provide meaningful and profound impact to the end users. This is outlined by Macmillan’s Professional Development and Knowledge Manager, Ms Libby Potter \( **I**\): “ *The work UoG undertook helped me hugely to understand the role of social prescribing and the potential for something like Flourish to be something that could be prescribed. Because we were able to identify the particular features and benefits via the research, we could then apply that to the person and what matters to them particularly.”* The impact on both patient\-participants and the NHS is also echoed by Dr Simon Opher MBE \( **D**\), who alongside being the clinical lead for social prescribing in Gloucestershire, is also a local GP: “ *the effects on patients have been varied but quite profound, so that people have actually felt better in themselves having completed the Art Intervention, they have got lower rates of consulting their GP \(which I have personally seen, as a GP\). They often do not need other agencies once they have engaged in the arts project, and they also quite often have carried on doing art outside of their prescribed course. That is really a fantastic outcome for the NHS because it means that we do not have to fund continuing therapy that is working for patients, and it has allowed a degree of patient autonomy as well.”.* Ultimately, without the research from the unit many of these services would not be commissioned, nor continued, nor extended to use as models for UK social prescribing provision to make these profound impacts on the lives of UK primary care patients. 

 The impact of the research is also now well beyond arts, with the Head of Community Programmes, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust \( **H**\), Ms Lorna Fox, illustrating how the research has informed nature prescriptions in Gloucestershire, and also now influence national nature and health policy.  Similarly, the Macmillan Senior Learning and Development Manager for South West & Midlands \( **I**\), Ms Libby Potter, illustrates how cancer patient therapy is now embracing Arts, and the profound impacts on the patients’ wellbeing and identity, and sense of purpose.  Photography is also now featuring as a growing intervention, particularly involving nature, with the Director, Look Again \( **J**\), Ms Ruth Davey, showing how enterprises are already building in the prior evidence and evaluation models developed through the Unit’s research to enhance practice and optimise benefits for the end users.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 GRiST is a mental\-health clinical decision support system \(DSS\) delivered by Aston as a cloud\-computing service. It is used around the clock by NHS, charity and private hospital practitioners to assess and manage risks associated with mental\-health problems, including suicide, self\-harm, harm to others, self\-neglect and vulnerability. 5,879 practitioners have registered 126,305 new patients with GRiST and completed 367,047 risk assessments, including over 1.5 million separate risk evaluations. GRiST has changed organisational and clinical processes through its systematic collection of risk information and associated clinical risk judgements. Machine\-learning predictions validate the judgements and help GRiST’s principled risk formulations generate appropriate management plans. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 One in six people suffer mental health problems at any moment in time \(Public Health England, 2019\). In the UK, there are almost nine suicides per 100,000 \(and many more attempts\) making it the second\-highest cause of death in people aged 15 to 29. Assessing the risks requires specialist training and current risk\-assessment tools collect unstructured data that are difficult to analyse and share by machines. GRiST is a new approach conceived and developed by **Buckingham** at Aston. It emerged from his research into interpreting clinical decision\-making as three linked, iterative classification tasks: diagnosing; assessing potential outcomes; and making intervention decisions **\[R1\]**. Concurrently, **Buckingham** showed how his “Galatean” model of psychological classification **\[R2\]** can be used to capture mental\-health practitioners’ knowledge and reasoning processes. The two research strands were integrated to build a formal model of risk assessment expertise **\[R3\]** and put it at the heart of a mental\-health web\-based Decision Support System \(DSS\), GRiST \( [www.egrist.org](http://www.egrist.org/)\), that communicates data, risk levels, and appropriate advice **\[R4\]**. 

 A series of grants **\[e.g. G3, G5\]** enabled the psychological underpinnings of GRiST to elicit clinical expertise in a format that end users could fully understand and apply across different assessment contexts **\[R4\]**, including versions for people without mental\-health expertise **\[R5\]**. The result is a unique, machine\-processable model of mental\-health risks and machine learning advice **\[R6\]** that directly led to research impact via its incremental deployment within the GRiST DSS. 

 GRiST’s web\-based system \[www.egrist.org/try\-grist\] helps clinicians: \(i\) collect and record relevant risk data for particular patients and assessment circumstances; \(ii\) see how the data contribute to risk evaluations; \(iii\) benchmark their judgements against thousands of mental\-health colleagues and the 1.5 million risk judgements they have made \[GRiST database\]; and \(iv\) identify where patients need help. It motivated national **\[e.g. G2,G5\]** and international **\[e.g. G3,G4,G6\]** research funding that ensured GRiST works right across the care pathway, from people living in the community – e.g. Improving Access to Psychological Therapies \(IAPT\), independent living villages – to specialist secondary\-care services – e.g. forensic and learning disabilities. US funding **\[G6\]** enabled **Buckingham** to explore suicide causes by analysing GRiST records and serious incident reports that led to the implementation of risk formulations. A US/UK collaborative grant **\[G8\]** came out of the GRiST research to explore health inequalities and helped ensure GRiST avoided racial and gender biases. 

 The generic nature of GRiST’s methods and psychological underpinnings enabled the technologies to be applied in different knowledge domains, such as logistics and water\-pipe condition assessment. The logistics project **\[G7\]** applied **Buckingham’s** Galatean model to implement shared decision\-making between individual transport depots. It subsequently informed the collaborative clinical and self\-assessments built into GRiST **\[R5\]** that empowers people to co\-create their own health, as advocated by Government policy \(e.g. DHSS, 2018: the future of healthcare\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 GRiST \[www.egrist.org\] changes practice by formalising data collection, visualising where risks originate, analysing and displaying risks over time, enabling customised risk reports, and comparing individual risk judgements with expert consensus to improve accuracy and highlight potential errors. Impact is integral to the research process as clinician and user involvement was written into grants **\[e.g. G3,G5\]**. 

 **GRiST usage:** 5,879 mental\-health practitioners have used GRiST 436 times a day on average to register 126,305 new patients, complete 367,047 risk assessments, including over 1.5 million separate risk judgements, and review patients’ reports \[GRiST database\]. GRiST has been used in seven secondary care NHS organisations, eight primary and community care services, and 19 private healthcare organisations and charities \[www.egrist.org/sponsors\]. 

 **GRiST shared decision\-making:** GRiST’s potential for shared decision\-making and collaborative care was recognised by the Health Foundation **\[G5\]** and Horizon2020 **\[G3\]**. Development of the new self\-assessment version – myGRiST – was an international collaboration **\[G3\]** with technology for translating into any language. Dutch was used by KU Leuven for older adult evaluation **\[E1\]** and Portuguese for child and adolescent risk evaluations **\[E5\].** The new myGRiST assesses workplace mental health in the SURFWELL programme, run by Devon and Cornwall Police **\[E2\]**, and in Evolyst's grant\-funded Lumien project **\[G2\]**. Linking GRiST with sensors that monitor people at home led to collaborations with ExtraCare retirement villages, and an international sensor company, RedGear **\[E3\]**. 

 **Improving clinical practice:** GRiST’s expanding dataset is one of only four identified UK specialist mental\-health datasets **\[E4\]**. Its analysis of mental\-health clinicians’ risk judgements **\[R6\]** feeds into practice through the GRiST DSS, generating international interest. Examples include: Portuguese mental\-health training using GRiST **\[E5\]**; a Walden University \(USA\) doctoral study, where “the screening tool that would guide the development … was the GRiST tool'' and “Monies have been budgeted for the cost of the GRiST software'' **\[E6\]**; a collaboration with European academic and technology organisations **\[G3\]**; and funding from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention which said: “We are so happy to have helped you complete important work in the field of suicide prevention'' **\[G6, email to Buckingham\]**. GRiST also improved management plans by linking assessments to them via risk formulations: “GRIST has provided a solution that has worked much better than previous risk assessment tools utilised in the Trust. It supported structured risk assessments and the development \[of\] formulations and safety plans'' **\[E7\]**. 

 Care Quality Commission \(CQC\) reports evidence impact. Examples include Humber NHS Trust: “We found thorough risk assessments on the case files we reviewed in the CAMHS teams using GRIST. These were completed to aid the planning and delivery of support and intervention.'' **\[E8\]**; and Imagine Independence: “Any incidents were recorded and monitored immediately using the GRIST tool, which enabled staff to monitor risk and revise support plans, reviewing the level of risk on a daily basis'' **\[E8\]**. CQC reports show GRiST supports shared and person\-centred risk assessment and management **\[E8\]**. Examples include Mental Health Concern: “GRIST… provided information on how individual risks were changing and any improvement to the risk to assist recovery. Staff worked in partnership with people and they provided one\-to\-one support meetings with the person to try to alleviate the risk'' **\[E8\]**. Similar reports relate to young\-person's GRiST assessments. Durham County Council’s website states the use of GRiST for improving quality assurance systems \( [https://www.durham.gov.uk/article/21413/Specialist\-services](https://www.durham.gov.uk/article/21413/Specialist-services)\), and its collaborative role is confirmed by an OFSTED report: “Case managers ensure that children’s risk assessments and risk management plans incorporate all known and potential risks. They work with children to help them to understand how their emotions and frustrations may increase these risks” **\[E9\]**. 

 **Training and awareness: Buckingham** has trained hundreds of practitioners on GRiST \(e.g. 184 from six organisations in 2018\) and an independent company uses GRiST in its mental health training **\[E10\]**. A Brussels GRiST presentation led to an EU Erasmus project \[G4\], training older adults and their carers in IT for independent living. GRiST workshops were attended by mental\-health practitioners and users nationally \(e.g. Meridian IAPT conference, 2019; Oxford University, 2016 and 2015; National Information Board, 2016; British Science Festival, 2014\) and internationally \(e.g. Vienna, 2017; Health Informatics Society, Dublin, 2017; Amsterdam EACH conference, 2014\) \[ [www.egrist.org/news](http://www.egrist.org/news)\]. A KU Leuven ATHENS module \( [www.athensprogramme.com](http://www.athensprogramme.com/)\) included GRiST, with 29 students attending from 9 different universities across Europe in 2018 \[https://www.egrist.org/node/611\]. 

 **Economic impacts:** GRiST is linked to several patient record systems: IAPTus \( [https://iaptus.co.uk/](https://iaptus.co.uk/)\) , which supports most primary care IAPT services; Carenotes \( [https://www.oneadvanced.com/solutions/carenotes/](https://www.oneadvanced.com/solutions/carenotes/)\) and RiO \( [https://www.servelec.co.uk/product\-range/rio\-epr\-system/](https://www.servelec.co.uk/product-range/rio-epr-system/)\) in secondary care; and Salesforce via Sandyx \( [https://www.sandyx.com/aboutus/](https://www.sandyx.com/aboutus/)\) in community care. Private and charitable organisations using GRiST's patient record system improve market strength by having a validated risk and safety system, with GRiST regularly featuring positively in quality evaluations \[E8, E9\]. GRiST directly generates income from licence to use fees \(£115,350 in 2019/2020\) **\[E11\]**, spinning out as a separate company: egrist ltd \( [https://find\-and\-update.company\-information.service.gov.uk/company/11638424](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11638424)\). Its commercial viability is shown by winning an ICURe grant and being selected for the second stage where GRiST can pitch for up to 300K from InnovateUK **\[G1\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Age\-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of blindness, affecting more than 600,000 people in the UK and 200 million globally. Low macular pigment density is a risk factor for the disease, but screening has been hampered by technological limitations. University of Bristol research showed that our ability to see the polarization of light could be used for rapid and non\-invasive assessment of macular pigment density. In 2016, spin\-out company Azul Optics Ltd was formed to develop the product, MP\-eye, and has attracted over \[text removed for publication\] of investment. MP\-eye has sold \[text removed for publication\] across the UK, mainland Europe and Scandinavia, Canada, Australia and the Philippines. MP\-eye improves personalisation of consultations with optometrists and changes individuals’ behaviour to protect their long\-term eye health. Opticians have reported increased sales of sunglasses, supplements and blue filtering lenses.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Polarization is a property of light, like colour and brightness, which can provide distinct and useful information about a visual scene. Many animals use the polarization of light to improve visual contrast and to inform behaviours including navigation and communication. Prof Nicholas Roberts and Dr Shelby Temple, with funding from the BBSRC \[i, ii\], developed a new, real time display\-screen technology for visualizing different polarization images which was used to test how well different species of both invertebrates and vertebrates \(cephalopods, fish and crustaceans\) \[1, 2\] could see the polarization of light. 

 Roberts and Temple realised that the same technology could be extended to test how sensitive humans are at seeing the polarization of light \[2\]. The test was based on “Haidinger’s brushes” – an entopic visual phenomenon that relies on the absorption of light by macular pigments in the eye. They hypothesized that the threshold of being able to see Haidinger’s brushes \(HB\) as the percent of light that was polarized was decreased would relate to the density of macular pigments in the eye. 

 Macular pigments \(MPs\) absorb short\-wavelength \(380–500nm\) visible light and thereby provide protection to the most vulnerable and arguably important region of the retina, the fovea at the centre of the macula. In addition to blue light protection, the macular pigments are antioxidants and neutralize free radicals that are a causative agent for age\-related macular degeneration \(AMD\). Higher levels of MPs reduce later life risks of developing AMD. 

 While working on publication \[2\], Temple made the connection that this technology could be used as a tool to assess an individual’s risk factor for AMD. Follow\-up research funded through a BBSRC Research Grant \[ii\], an associated Impact Acceleration Award \[iii\], and an Innovate UK Innovation to Commercialisation of University Research \(ICURe\) Aid for Start\-Ups Grant \[iv\], uncovered the full details of the relationship between the macular pigment density and our ability to see the polarization of light, proving this was a feasible approach \[3, 4\]. 

 The core technology was patented \[5\], and a company \(Azul Optics Ltd\) was set up and incorporated in August 2016. Independent investment and grant funding were obtained, and over three years the company has developed a product called the MP\-eye. The approach is elegantly simple. Individuals are asked to identify the direction of rotation of HB when presented with a circular stimulus illuminated with an even intensity of polarized white light in which the electric field vector rotates either clockwise or anti\-clockwise. By reducing the degree of polarization of the stimulus light, a threshold for perceiving HB \(degree of polarization threshold\) is determined. Unlike previous methods of assessing macular pigment density, the speed and ease of measurement of degree of polarization threshold makes it well suited for large\-scale screening of macular pigmentation. In 2017, Dr Temple was awarded the BBSRC Innovator of the Year award for his success in translating his research into a transforming commercial entity.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Age\-related macular degeneration \(AMD\) affects more than 600,000 people in the UK alone and is estimated to cost the UK healthcare system GBP1.6 billion annually. This number will rise over the coming years as we all continue to live longer and diets worsen for many. Globally the number affected by AMD is predicted to increase to 288 million by 2040. 

#  Commercialization of a new diagnosis technology 

 Following the application to patent the core technology \[5\], Azul Optics Ltd was set up in August 2016 and, over a three\-year period, a novel diagnostic to assess the amount of macular pigment present in the eye was developed. The device, the MP\-eye, is designed for optometrists and enables them to identify people who are at a current increased risk of AMD. Consequently, customers can be empowered to take preventative actions such as wearing protective eyewear and hats, quitting smoking, improved diet and / or supplements and increased fitness, all of which can reduce the risks of sight loss later in life. MP\-eye was registered with the MHRA as a class 1 medical device in October 2018 \[Ai\]. 

 To date, Azul Optics has attracted total investment of \[text removed for publication\] \[Ai\]. The MP\-eye was shortlisted for the ‘good’ award \(best use of technology for doing good\) in the South West ‘SPARKies’ awards \(2018\) and was a finalist for the ‘Product of the Year’ at the Association of Optometrists \(AOP\) awards \(2020\). 

 In 2018, Azul Optics signed an exclusive UK distribution agreement with BIB Ophthalmic Instruments that increased MP\-eye product reach across the UK \[B\]. Subsequent to this, Azul Optics has started working with distributors across \[text removed for publication\] \[Ai\]. 

#  Improved optometrist service provision 

 Optometrists value the additional service and highlight how ‘ *the technology has really added an extra dimension to our service’* \[C\] *.* Feedback from a number of UK practices confirms the added value to both individual customer consultations: 

-  ‘*a more personalised and individualised consultation to our patients, meaning we can give them advice on what treatments would be best for them. It’s also a really quick test, around a minute long, which benefits both us and the patient’* \[C\]. 

-  *‘Unlike an OCT image or fundus photograph that require me to interpret the output for them, my patients engage with the MP\-eye test and so find it easy to understand their score’* \[E\]. 

-  *‘I had a conversation \[with a younger patient\] about eye disease and preventative care that I would typically have had with someone over 55’* \[E\]. 

-  *‘The MP\-eye is a great piece of new technology that has become a focal point for conversations with our patients about what they can do to maintain good eye health through life’* \[E\]. 

-  *‘The fact that there is a device specifically designed to measure this seems to add weight to the conversations we always used to have anyway. It’s certainly easier for our patients to understand a number on a 1 – 10 scale than the potentially abstract explanation & advice we would have given them in the past, and so responses to macular pigment screening have been overwhelmingly positive’.* \[Hi\]. 

 and the practice: 

-  *‘the practice has significantly improved sales of supplements, blue blocking lenses & sunglasses, leading to a quick return on investment for the MP\-Eye’* \[D\]. 

 Of 432 customers at one practice, 151 \(35%\) scored low on the MP\-eye and, of these, 43 chose to select lenses with increased protection against light damage \(e.g., sunglasses, photochromics and blue filtering lenses\). The effect of this on revenue for the practice is in the order of GBP1,500 per month. This increase in sales not only improves protection and benefits the eye health of customers, but also increases positive cash flow for optometrists who are able to sell protective products to customers \[Aii\]. 

#  Change in consumer behaviour to improve eye health and ageing outcomes 

 Feedback from a practice in Northampton, reports nearly 2,000 people in about 1 year had been tested with their MP\-eye system. Based on the availability of MP\-eye \[text removed for publication\], nearly 20,000 people have been screened in the UK. Global figures, \[text removed for publication\], would put this number at over 50,000, of whom 30% who would have scored low, have consequently been given advice about how they can make lifestyle changes to decrease their risk of developing AMD. CEO of Distributor BIB Ophthalmic Instruments commented on the positive feedback from eye care professionals who report that ‘ *the MP\-eye has encouraged patients to take action on what they can do to protect their long\-term eye health*’ \[Bi\]. 

 Data collected by Azul Optics \[text removed for publication\], to understand customer behaviour, has shown that the score an individual receives from the MP\-eye assessment is associated with purchases of protective products. 78% of people that scored very low \(1, blue test\) bought protective products. This decreased to 43% of people that scored low \(1 to 3, white test\) and 17% of people that scored med \(4 to 6\), while 0% of people that scored high \(7\-10\) bought protective products \[Hii\]. 

 Macular pigments can only be obtained from our diet. To maintain healthy macular pigment levels, people must eat a diet high in lutein and zeaxanthin, which can be obtained from foods such as kale, spinach, red and yellow peppers, corn and various other dark and brightly coloured fruits and vegetables. Many people do not eat enough of these foods and/or spend too much time in sunlight or using up their macular pigments through poor lifestyle choices such as smoking and unhealthy food items. 

-  *‘it has encouraged better buying decisions from some of our patients with respect to macular supplements, blue\-protective lenses, Transitions & sunspecs’* \[Hi\]. 

-  *‘a female patient, aged 60 who has some drusen in her periphery, scored very low initially. I provided recommendations, including supplements, and 6 months later during the next check\-up, the same patient measured had substantially increased. This is a great outcome for the patient’* \[E\]. 

-  *‘I \[tested\] a mother and her son….last year and she said, oh I’m sure he’ll be brilliant because he’s always quicker than me... We weren’t busy so I said well let him have a go, and he scored really badly and she was quite shocked. Then opening the discussion we talked about his diet and she said he will not eat any fruit and vegetables. So since then she’s been in and she said he’ll let her make him kale and blueberry smoothy now. He’s having it for breakfast because he wants to beat her*.’ \[F\]. 

 Data collected by Azul Optics from their customers shows a 70% increase in sunglasses sales, a 100% increase in supplement sales and 200% increase in customers choosing blue filtering lenses creating a return in investment in 6\-7 months \[E\]. 

 A practice in Northamptonshire teamed up with their local association for the blind during National Eye Health Week to offer free drop in assessments using the MP\-eye, aimed at people who don’t get their eyes examined regularly. The Marketing and Fundraising Manager for the charity explained that *‘By taking these readings now we can hopefully spot the signs of potential problems at an early stage and recommend ways of improving eye health.’* \[I\]. 

#  Improved practitioner and public understanding of blue light risks 

 Many people are aware of the risks of UV light but often fail to realise that blue light is another wavelength in the light spectrum that can be dangerous for eye health. Dr Temple has given talks and interviews for both practitioners \(e.g., Association of Optometrists \(AOP\)\) and the public on the subject of blue light \[G\]. A recent webinar for Thea, a global pharmaceutical company, attracted 800 participants from their customer base and approximately 250 participants viewed a further webinar hosted by Azul Optics themselves \[Giii\]. Dr Temple has since been asked to provide scientific content on the blue light, reactive oxygen species and macular pigment topic to \[text removed for publication\] \[A\]. Feedback from an optometrist working with \[text removed for publication\] highlighted the benefit for his practice; *‘it has improved my team’s understanding of – and confidence in discussing – the blue light hazard’* \[Hi\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor David Edgerton’s research has changed understandings of key issues of 20th\-century British history among politicians, journalists and intellectuals. He championed the idea of British nationalism, rather than imperialism, as a key concept within public discussion around the causes of Brexit. Through radically rewriting the history of industrial strategy in Britain, he informed a cross\-party shift towards taking policy for innovation and industry seriously. By challenging national myths of the Second World War, particularly the idea that the UK was weak and alone in 1940, Edgerton not only reframed the public understanding of the conflict, but also the parallels drawn from it, notably Brexit and COVID\-19. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Edgerton’s series of ground\-breaking books has presented a concerted challenge to hackneyed tropes and well\-entrenched orthodoxies in the history of the UK during the 20th century, changing the terms of academic study as well as popular understanding of the period. 

#  Taking British nationalism seriously 

 *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation*, which to date has sold 18,000 copies, centres on a novel conceptualisation of a new British nation and nationalism after 1945 emerging out of the British empire/global economy and forged within a new national political economic framework. This contrasts with earlier approaches that see imperialism and nationalism as one and stress the continuity of imperialist delusions after 1945, leading to economic decline, racism and as explanatory causes to Brexit in the recent past. 

 *The* *Rise and Fall of the British Nation* also contains an empirical and theoretical critique of the dominant accounts of the nature of British capitalism and capitalists and relations to the British state. Far from an anti\-industrial political culture, Edgerton stresses the close links, not least in politics, between state and capital, arguing that the high point of British industrial production was in the 1950s and 1960s and that there has since been a determined move away from promoting a national capitalism. 

#  Writing in Britain’s developmental state 

 *Warfare State* and *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation* show that after the Second World War UK governments of both political parties maintained a strong military and industrial policy designed to strengthen the new post\-imperial nation, which directly complemented post\-war welfarist and social policies. His approach contrasts sharply with previous orthodoxies insisting on the centrality of the welfare state only and which portrayed industrial and innovation policy as weak and at best misdirected. Edgerton, in other words, allows us to see that the UK had a developmental state in the post\-war decades, in which politicians and bureaucrats sort to foster national industries and promote national inventions. 

#  Neither weak, nor ‘alone’ 

 *Warfare State* and *Britain’s War Machine* \(which has sold more than 17,000 copies\), in contrast to the view that British arms were weak in the inter\-war years and thus in 1939–40, show that for most of the time, the RAF and Royal Navy were in fact second to none and were supported by probably the largest military\-industrial\-scientific complex in the world. 

 *Britain’s War Machine* shows that during the Second World War the UK and the British empire relied on capital intensive forces, much more so than Germany. Furthermore, the nation was not alone, nor believed to be alone \(as modern historiography suggests\), but was part of an empire, always had allies and also depended on massive overseas supply. All this represents a major revision of older and recent works on the war. The book was widely reviewed in the national press \(and was lead review in *The Observer*\), was shortlisted for the Hessell\-Tiltman History Prize and was a *Guardian* Book of the Year. 

 As the academic reviews noted, all these works rely on extensive primary research to make radically new arguments about 20th\-century British history, including the public\-facing works.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Following the 2016 Brexit referendum, there was a dramatic transformation in the public life of the UK. For some, it involved much heart\-searching about the true nature of Britain and British history, while for others it was a moment to celebrate and replay the Second World War. For many politicians it was a time to rethink British policy, not least industrial and innovation policy. In these contexts, reshaping understandings of history, understood to be of central political relevance, had a material impact. Edgerton’s work made people think in new ways. This impact was achieved through writing books for the general public \[2,3\] and drawing directly on the books, multiple articles for the press, speaking at government and other events, and many appearances on TV and radio \[D\]. His books became necessary reading for many in public life on both the left and the right. The *New Statesman* said of *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation* that: “Every so often a book comes out that the entire political class needs to read”. *The Rise and Fall* was noted as a feature of the literary year 2018 by *Whitaker’s Almanac* and was a book of the year in *Prospect, History Today* and the *New Statesman* \[A\]. It was reviewed in nearly all the national press and most of the major weeklies, often as a lead review. 

 The impact revolved around three themes: \(i\) putting the idea of British nationalism, rather than imperialism, and the decay of a British national capitalism into the discussion on Brexit; \(ii\) creating a new account of national policy for innovation and industry, which helped to reinvigorate the contemporary desire for a coherent industrial strategy; and \(iii\) undermining key myths of the Second World War that Britain was alone and weak in 1940 and, in turn, rethinking what many consider to be its contemporary analogues, Brexit and COVID\-19. 

#  Putting nationalism and the national economy into the Brexit debate 

 Edgerton transformed the public debate on Brexit by framing its causes in terms of British nationalism and the demise of the national economy. The standard view, among many historians and among the largely Remain\-backing commentariat, was that the Brexit vote was, like the failure to enter the EEC in the 1950s, a product of an underlying British imperialism. This was one of the many ways British history was linked to Brexit. *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation* was a powerful force in changing minds and in introducing new elements into the debate. The intervention was two\-fold. First, the importance of post\-war nationalism, rather than imperialism, in shaping the politics of Brexit: that Brexit was a longing for a national politics and a national economy that had been central to Britain in the 1960s and 1970s. The second was his argument that the old British national capitalism had given way to a strong non\-British capitalism in the UK, which necessarily had very different connections to the Conservative Party. This helped explain the mystery of why the Conservative government was pursuing a Brexit policy that business in Britain did not support and why business was so acquiescent. 

 It was clear from commentary on the book and related work that Edgerton had taken a distinctive and politically significant view on Brexit that gave him a pathway to impact. Opinion formers took note of *The Rise and Fall* and Edgerton was invited to contribute op\-ed pieces of major reach. He was commissioned to write five *Guardian* articles, while the *New Statesman* commissioned a cover story on the transformation of British capitalism and a long read on the historical politics of British trade. The distinctiveness and significance of the arguments led him to be invited onto Radio 4’s *Today* programme \(reaching around 5 million listeners\) to discuss his book on the first anniversary of the Brexit vote. He was often paired with the most important pro\-Brexit historians: for example, with Robert Tombs on the BBC World Service and on *Newsnight,* and with the Thatcher biographer and former editor of the *Telegraph* and *Spectator* Charles Moore on a *Channel Four News* podcast. In a truncated online clip, this had 364,000 views and 4,000 retweets on Twitter, with thousands of reactions, comments and shares on Facebook, and led to stories on it in the *New European* on the *Independent* website \[B,D\]. 

 Edgerton’s argument that one needed to take account of a deep but unrecognised non\-imperial British nationalism in Brexit became part of a national discussion. As one comment on Twitter put it: “Are you sure that Brexiters are longing for the Empire, rather than the pre\-Thatcher British nation which David Edgerton’s book is about?” \[D\]. The *New Statesman* recognised how *The Rise and Fall of the British Nation*: “challenges many of the fundamental preconceptions of Brexiteers and Remainers alike”. In the *Economist*, a dedicated column hailed its call to rethink what “we thought we knew about British national character” \[A\]. For other people, it helped make sense of the politics of Brexit: a socialist activist \(with 120,000 followers on Twitter\) noted: “I’m struck how coalitions, shifting party loyalties, constitutional skirmishes and multiple nationalisms are the historical norm for British politics – not some terrifying modern malfunction” \[D\]. 

 The idea of an imperial origin of Brexit, that the empire was striking back, was also strong in the policy world in Brussels and Edgerton’s book had a role in changing that. Dr Eoin Drea, Senior Research Officer at the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies in Brussels \(the official think tank of the European Peoples’ Party \(Christian Democrats\)\), organised a panel with Edgerton in June 2019 attended by around 100 EU officials and others concerned with EU policy to discuss the empire strikes back thesis and his critique. Dr Drea noted in his opening remarks: “The Rise and Fall of the British Nation: \[is\] the inspiration for this event” \[F\]. 

 Edgerton’s work on the specific nature of British capitalism also altered the terms of the Brexit debate. One article in *The* *Guardian* on this theme garnered a quite exceptional 4,430 comments, 4,171 social media posts and at least 500 discrete tweets. The noted French intellectual Bruno Latour \(26,000 followers\) tweeted in response: “If you despair of understanding Brexit, David Edgerton’s piece is most remarkable in the link between forms of capitalism, influence on party politics, and the problem of who defends national interests” \[D\]. More generally, the claims about Brexit being driven by a Conservative Party no longer tied to a national capitalism were seized on by foreign journalists who found Brexit otherwise inexplicable. The argument was picked up very strongly by business and economic journalists, both in Britain and aboard, who wished to explain to their business readers the strange politics of Brexit \[A\]. 

#  The policy implications of Britain’s developmental state 

 The standard view of post\-war industrial and innovation policy was that it was weakly developed and was a failure. In revising the standard account of post\-war policy \[1,3\], Edgerton argued that the British record in industrial policy after 1945 was one of serious policy activism and ambition, and one in which the state spent a great deal on R&D and achieving some success. This argument gave courage to advocates of fresh policy initiatives across the political spectrum, from Policy Exchange on the right and the Institute of Public Policy Research on the left, and in the government and in the opposition. The issue gained new salience after the Brexit referendum as some politicians in the Conservative Party sought to develop a more national policy for innovation and industry under Theresa May, and also in the post\-Brexit Labour party. 

 Edgerton’s work on the history of industrial and innovation policy changed the view of policymakers and politicians. Tony Curzon Price, Economic Advisor to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy between 2016 and 2019, cited Edgerton’s work extensively in briefs for his minister on industrial strategy, innovation policy, consumer protection and regulation for innovation; decisions on nuclear power, energy policy and decarbonisation; and increase in state R&D. Curzon Price noted that “David Edgerton’s Rise and Fall of the British Nation had a material impact in all of these policy areas” because it changed minds about the success and nature of industrial strategy of the past. The impact of Edgerton’s ideas at senior levels in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) may also be judged from the fact that he was invited to address more than 100 civil servants at BEIS \[G\]. 

 In the Labour party too, there was new interest in national economics and industrial policy, which was sharpened and made more confident as a result of Edgerton’s research. The Rt Hon Rachel Reeves MP, the former chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, said: *“*David’s history provides an important historical guide in helping us think about how in future we can develop a Labour political economy” \[E\]. She also cited his arguments in a contribution to a Fabian Society book, *Beyond Brexit: The Left’s Agenda for the UK and EU* \(edited by Olivia Bailey, with a foreword by Sir Keir Starmer, 2018\). Edgerton has also become a regular participant in Labour Party policy seminars run by Rachel Reeves and attended by other members of the Shadow Cabinet. 

#  Never ‘alone’ and always strong 

 The standard popular argument in academic histories, on television and in popular histories of the Second World War was that in 1940 the UK was not only weak militarily and industrially, but also found itself alone and turned inward to find strength. This argument has been central in the political uses of histories of the war not least in the context of Brexit and COVID\-19. Edgerton’s argument that it was neither weak nor alone in *Britain’s War Machine*, that it was relatively strong and had many allies, as well as being *part* of the British empire and dependent on the rest of the world, challenged the core of the standard story. He contributed to the *New Statesman* on the meaning of VE Day, which provoked a Twitter storm \(1,400 retweets, 101 quoted tweets and 7,400 likes\) and generated an article in the *Daily Express* \[D\] *.* 

 The impact of these arguments was evidenced in a slew of books and programmes of very wide reach that took up his arguments explicitly, and in others where the older arguments were quietly dropped. For example, James Holland’s bestselling *War in the West* takes up Edgerton’s non\-declinist position. As he put it on Twitter \(to his 37,000 followers\), Edgerton “had a huge impact on my own studies into \#WWII & done much to kick the declinist view into touch” \[D\]. A BBC Radio 4 series on the economic history of 1940 gave pride of place to Edgerton’s arguments in its discussion of the UK. Similarly, his fresh account of the British case represented the UK in a VoxEU collection on the economics of the war for economists \(and was cited in the *Sunday Times\).* 

 Edgerton was also invited to present the British story from his point of view in many documentaries, including an outstanding ABC Australia series on the Second World War and the *War Factory* series \(2019\). The extent of the transformation can be gauged from an episode of the very popular Second World War podcast We Have Ways of Making You Talk *\(*Al Murray and James Holland\), which reflected on the ways Edgerton has changed understanding of the war \[C\]. As someone put it on Twitter, “Britain’s War Machine … will change your view of the war and Britain’s place in it forever” \[D\]. 

 His specific arguments about the war – that the nation was well\-prepared in advance and that the war involved extensive connections to the rest of the world – were also taken up as a distinct challenge to the view that there were good analogies between the war and COVID\-19 and which led to more responsible thinking about policy during the pandemic. His picture of the Second World War was also important in rejecting analogies between the war and the COVID\-19 crisis. One contribution was noted by John Naughton in the *Observer* as “a bracing post by historian David Edgerton on his terrific blog”. His view that the wartime analogies were false and dangerous helped reduce the prevalence of the argument and was widely adopted. A *Guardian* article on this was shared on social media 1,700 times. He was invited to contribute on this theme to the *New Statesman* and the *New European* and Evan Davis’s BBC Radio 4 *Bottom Line* business programme \(28 May 2020\) to elucidate comparisons between the Second World War and COVID\-19, as well as for the VoxTalk podcast for economists \[A,B\]. He was also quoted in a *Spears Magazine* cover story, a *Financial Times* long read and in *Fortune* and *Forbes* to support the argument that the wartime analogy was highly misleading \[A\]. The cumulative impact of these interventions among politicians, journalists and public intellectuals has been a definitive refashioning of key issues of 20th\-century British history and the implications of such frameworks for understanding Brexit Britain.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Based on their research into the characterisation of atmospheric aerosols, University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) researchers developed low\-cost Optical Particle Counters \(OPCs\) that measure airborne particulates at high resolutions. These were patented and commercialised by UK SME Alphasense Ltd; since 2015, 18,420 units have been integrated into air quality monitoring systems in 70 countries. This delivered significant economic impact: at least £53.2m in associated commercial revenues and 32 new jobs. The OPCs were used by the UN Environment Programme to map air pollution hotspots in the developing world and by World Athletics to monitor the impact of poor air quality on athletes’ health and performance. They were key to the establishment of comprehensive air quality monitoring networks by city authorities for more effective regulation and stronger public health protection, including three cities in China with a combined population of 24 million. Their affordability democratised access to air quality monitoring for citizen groups in five countries.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Accurate characterisation of atmospheric aerosols improves our understanding of how particulate matter affects air quality and the climate. However, accuracy has traditionally come at a prohibitive cost. About a decade ago, high\-resolution OPC instruments, which used light\-scattering technologies to count and size airborne particulates, typically cost in excess of £10,000, constraining the creation of air pollution monitoring networks capable of addressing what the World Health Organisation has defined as a ‘public health emergency’. 

 Between 2000 and 2011, researchers in the Particle Instruments and Diagnostics Research Group, led by Kaye and funded by NERC, the UK Met Office and the US National Science Foundation \[ **G1\-G5**\], were focused on the development of complex aircraft wing\-mounted cloud analysis instruments capable of the *in situ* identification, classification and sizing of atmospheric cloud particles such as ice crystals, microdroplets and mineral dust. The so\-called ‘SID’ \(Small Ice Detector\) probes provided data on the abundance, size and shapes of these atmospheric particles that profoundly affect cloud radiative properties – a primary source of uncertainty in climate change modelling. Critically, to avoid affecting the particles being measured, the SID instruments had to be ‘open\-path’ designs \[ **3.1**\], i.e. free from mechanical obstructions such as aerosol sampling tubes onto which droplets could impinge or ice crystals shatter. The Group’s aerodynamic and aerosol behaviour modelling ultimately resulted in wing\-mounted instruments that used two complex optical assemblies to spatially define a ‘virtual’ measurement zone in free space at the nose of the instrument, and a third to determine a particle’s size and shape. These instruments \(SID\-2 and SID\-3\), have since been successfully deployed by atmospheric scientists on more than 50 campaigns by the UK’s FAAM research aircraft \[ **3.2**\- **3.4**\]. The SID\-2 was the first device to successfully measure and classify high altitude atmospheric particles down to micron sizes \[ **3.4**\]. 

 In 2010, the Group applied the SIDs’ open\-path sampling principles to the design of OPCs for a ground\-based sensor network to study air quality at Heathrow Airport, as part of a NERC\-funded consortium led by the University of Cambridge \[ **G5**\]. The project required a network of sensor nodes to measure gases and particulates around the airport’s perimeter for a 15\-month period, but at the time there was no affordable solution for monitoring particulates. The challenge was two\-fold: firstly, traditional OPC designs were based on air pumps to draw in ambient aerosol. These pumps required protection from particle contamination \(a frequent cause of failure\) by an upstream particle filter. These filters would become blocked on a monthly basis and require manual replacement, an activity the Heathrow authorities would not accept. Secondly, conventional OPCs could suffer water damage by sampling fog droplets, not uncommon at Heathrow. 

 The pumpless, open\-path measurement protocol employed in the SID aircraft probes was, in principle, the ideal solution. However, the wing\-mounted SID designs were far too large and expensive for use at Heathrow, so the UH Group undertook extensive optical and aerodynamic modelling of various designs. The final design, later patented worldwide in 2015 \[ **3.5**\], was based on a unique geometry of custom\-designed elliptical mirror and dual\-element photodiode detectors, creating a ‘virtual’ particle measurement zone in free space, unencumbered by mechanical structures. It represented a breakthrough in OPC technology, offering accuracy approaching that of high\-end commercial instruments but at a small fraction of the cost, weight and power requirement. Critically, its design allowed long\-term unattended operation. 

 The OPCs were deployed at 42 locations around Heathrow, running continuously for 15 months without manual intervention, delivering 110 million particle size profiles and confirming their commercial viability as low\-cost, high\-quality sensors. The ‘Heathrow project’ demonstrated that major sources of air pollution outside the airport perimeter in fact originated from traffic emissions from central London \[ **3.6**\]. Consequently, the commercial potential of the OPCs was recognised by Alphasense Ltd, the sensor company that had provided the pollutant gas sensors to the Heathrow project. Alphasense licensed the technology from UH in 2013 and have since funded Kaye’s group to carry out further research for OPC design and performance improvement.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Having established itself as one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of gas sensor technologies, UK\-based Alphasense Ltd sought to expand into the particle monitoring field. In September 2013, the company signed a licensing agreement with UH to commercialise the patented OPC technology. Reliant on the expertise of Kaye’s group in optical and laser light\-scattering techniques, Alphasense commissioned UH to produce 150 OPC\-N1 prototype devices and design the algorithms required to assess particulate matter \(PM\) and convert particle size and count data to PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> for air quality monitoring. The prototypes were sold into the UK, US and Europe as core components that could be incorporated into commercial air quality monitoring systems. Customer feedback verified that the low\-cost OPC\-N1 units provided PM data comparable to that from existing OPCs, which were many times more expensive. 

 UH’s technology had opened up a market that was previously unachievable; the OPC’s low cost made the sale of monitoring systems capable of measuring PM commercially viable and, unlike other OPCs on the market, it was designed for unattended operation in inaccessible locations such as rooftops and trunk roads \[ **5.1**\]. Demand grew rapidly and Alphasense accelerated production, bringing the OPC\-N2 to market in early 2015. Growth was aided by independent evaluations confirming the efficacy of the OPC’s field performance, which were published in peer\-reviewed journals from 2017 onwards \[ **5.1**\]. With further research support from Kaye’s group, the company released the OPC\-N3 in March 2018, which, for the same price, extended the device’s capabilities to pollen and spore monitoring. 

 **Economic impact via revenues for SMEs in UK and overseas – and the wider supply chain** 

 At the end of 2020, Alphasense had sold 18,420 OPC\-N2 and OPC\-N3 units at £285 each, with sales rising to an average of \~500 per month. The OPCs have generated Alphasense £5.2m in revenue from sales in 70 countries, directly creating seven jobs at the company and making a significant contribution to its business performance \[ **5.1**, **5.2**\]. A further two FTE research roles have been created and sustained at UH through \~£100,000 a year in development funding from Alphasense. The product profit margin peaked at 64% in 2018. The company’s 2019 strategic report \[ **5.2**\] read: “ *The results for the year reflect further growth in turnover of 16% … Recently developed new products* \[referring to the OPCs\] *continued to perform well as concerns about air quality, especially in the Far East, led to impressive demand*.” Summing up the strategic importance of the OPCs, Alphasense’s Technical Director said: “ *Alphasense had concentrated on gas detection for 21 years but for the last seven years we have focused on developing our capability in particle monitoring, which has allowed us to cover all critical measurements in air quality at a time when air pollution has risen to the top of policy and media agendas* \[ **5.1**\].” 

 The majority of Alphasense’s customers over the impact period were commercial companies that manufactured and sold air quality systems and networks. Without the OPC, these products would not have come to market \[ **5.1**\]. Thus, UH research has resulted in economic impact via the wider supply chain. Its customers range from large companies, including GRIMM Aerosol, Bosch and Thermo Fisher, to SMEs, including South Coast Science and Atmospheric Sensors Ltd in the UK and QuantAQ in the US. Other significant customers are Kunak Technologies and Libelium, both based in Spain, and Sail Hero, the largest provider of air quality systems in China. According to Alphasense’s Technical Director, the OPC\-N3 has allowed these companies to enter or establish a competitive advantage in a global air quality monitoring market projected to reach $6bn in 2025 \[ **5.1**\]. Based on its own data, Alphasense reports that at least £48m in commercial revenues were generated and 25 sales, manufacturing and engineering jobs were created and sustained over the impact period through third\-party sales of integrated systems \[ **5.1**\]. As an example of how an Alphasense customer has benefitted from the OPCs, GRIMM Aerosol selected the OPC\-N3 for a new range of mid\-cost PM instruments after finding it outperformed competitor sensors; the company deployed the OPC\-N3 in a German government\-funded project to establish a smart air quality network in the city of Augsburg. Having long manufactured high\-end air quality monitoring reference and validation systems, the mid\-cost instrument means GRIMM has the capability to offer a fully integrated network comprising three tiers of instrumentation, increasing its market share and enabling urban authorities to widen their air quality sensor networks \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Supporting the establishment of air quality monitoring networks in major cities to address the health impacts of air pollution and better inform citizens** 

 In June 2014 the UN Environment Assembly, the world’s highest\-level decision\-making body on the environment, adopted a resolution to ‘strengthen the role of the UN Environment Programme \(UNEP\) in promoting air quality’. In September 2015, UNEP unveiled a low\-cost air quality monitoring device in September 2015, which the UN said could ‘ *revolutionise air quality measurement in developing countries and help prevent deaths from air pollution that claim seven million lives each year*’ \[ **5.4**\]. The incorporation of Alphasense’s OPC, based on UH’s research and patented technology, allowed the device to measure harmful particulate matter; its low cost ensured the device’s viability \[ **5.4**\]. UNEP’s Executive Director said its device cost $1,500 per unit, allowing governments to establish countrywide networks of monitoring stations for $150,000 \- $200,000 – less than the cost of just a single monitoring station \($250,000\) at that time \[ **5.4**\]. UNEP published the blueprint for its UNEP Air Quality Monitoring Unit, specifying the use of the OPC\-N2, ‘ *as a global public good*’ to ‘ *enable governments and organisations to purchase, assemble or fabricate the units themselves*’ \[ **5.4**\]. UNEP launched the Unit in Nairobi to map the city’s air pollution hotspots before deploying the system in 30 cities in developing countries \[ **5.4**\]. 

 City authorities around the world are using Alphasense’s OPCs via the purchase of integrated air quality monitoring systems, in which the OPC\-N3 is necessary to measure PM data \[ **5.1**\]. As an example, Chinese SME Shenzhen Cambri Environmental Technology purchased \~800 OPCs from Alphasense, integrated them into their own air quality monitoring instruments and supplied them to city authorities in three Chinese cities \(Shenzhen, pop. 12.5m; Dongguan, pop. 8.25m; Rizhao, pop. 2.8m\) for measuring hyperlocal air quality \[ **5.5**\]. Through the OPCs, environmental protection bureaus at these municipal governments can identify key sources of particulate emissions and enforce regulation where appropriate, e.g. if a factory is breaching emissions limits or operating without a license \[ **5.5**\]. Shenzen Cambri reports that the availability of the OPCs has facilitated the rapid growth of the company; since its formation in 2018 it has created 25 jobs \[ **5.5**\]. 

 In the US, Massachusetts\-based start\-up QuantAQ, a spin out from MIT, uses the OPC\-N3 in its integrated air quality monitoring system Modulair™\-PM \[ **5.6**\]. Example use cases \[ **5.6**\] include monitoring indoor air quality in Georgia Institute of Technology’s classrooms during the Covid\-19 pandemic to guide decisions around the resumption of in\-person teaching. The Modulair is being used at several airports \(e.g. Boston Logan International Airport\) to measure emissions and their impact on local communities; citizen\-led activist groups are collaborating on these projects. The US National Park Service is using it to monitor the impact of wildfires on air quality. 

 **Facilitating UN\-World Athletics collaboration to raise global awareness of air pollution, protect athletes’ health and study the impact of poor air quality on athletic performance** 

 In May 2018, World Athletics \(then IAAF\) announced a five\-year partnership with UNEP to install air quality monitoring systems at all of its 1,000 outdoor athletics tracks. The collaboration aims to study the correlation between poor air quality and athletic performance; to identify the best times for events to be held based on pollution levels; and to create greater global awareness of the wider importance of air quality monitoring. The IAAF awarded the contract for the provision of the air quality monitoring devices to Spain’s Kunak Technologies, a key customer of Alphasense. The first stadium air quality monitor \(using the OPC\-N3 to measure particulate matter\) was installed in Monaco in September 2018, providing real\-time, publicly available data. Monitors were then installed over an 18\-month period in Addis Ababa, Sydney, Mexico City and Yokohama \[ **5.7**\]. On launching the programme, the director of UNEP’s Global Environmental Monitoring System Unit said: *“The IAAF partnership provides practical insight into the use of low\-cost sensors, so it can be the first step to build capacity at city\-level networks, bringing together science for policy; using evidence\-based air quality assessments to develop better urban policies* \[ **5.7**\].” Air quality monitoring has since become a central element of World Athletics’ *Sustainability Strategy*, which pledges carbon neutrality by 2030. In August 2020 Kunak’s system captured air quality data along the Tokyo Olympic marathon course in Sapporo, a year ahead of the scheduled race itself \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Democratising access to air quality monitoring devices for civic activism on pollution** 

 The low cost of OPC technology has helped open up air monitoring to citizen\-led science projects designed to empower communities and pressure governments to act on air quality. US\-based Safecast describes itself as a global volunteer\-centred citizen science project working to empower people with data about their environments. Twenty of the organisation’s *Solarcast* air quality sensors, incorporating an Alphasense OPC\-N2, were deployed around Los Angeles in September 2017 \[ **5.8**\]. Three months later, when Southern California experienced serious forest fires, Safecast moved a number of these sensors “ *to help give people an idea of what they might be breathing and where to go to avoid increased exposure*”. The Arvin Air Quality Project is a citizen science project run by the Central California Environmental Justice Network across the city of Arvin which has some of the worst air pollution levels in the country. Having purchased air quality sensors from LA\-based technology company Valarm, which were built around the Alphasense OPC\-N2, the project deployed sensors across Arvin and real\-time data was published on a dedicated website \[ **5.8**\]. From 2018, the Open\-Seneca initiative deployed citizen science networks of low\-cost air quality sensors \(using Alphasense OPCs\) in Cambridge, Buenos Aires and Mendoza, Nairobi and Belo Horizonte. Local stakeholders have taken ownership of the sensor networks for long\-term sustainability \[ **5.8**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Sanders has transformed the regulation of the sex work industry. Historically, police and health practitioners focussed on physical environments as the primary location where crimes against sex workers occurred and support interventions were required. Sanders’s research has catalysed a shift in emphasis to digital spaces, which now form the primary location of the sex work market. This scholarship has fostered positive change in policies, practices and interventions focused on online sex worker safety. Sanders’s research has transformed approaches to supporting the health and safety of online sex workers to improve support for those who are victims of crime and how the police engage with sex workers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Sanders is amongst the most prolific researchers in the UK exploring sex work in relation to safety, regulation and working conditions. Her internationally significant research has made a transformative contribution to the social, cultural and regulatory understanding of sex work in the last twenty years. 

 **Beyond the Gaze \(2016–ongoing\):** In the last two decades, the sex industry has undergone a substantial transition towards digital technology: most commercial sex work now happens through or on the internet. Sanders led a ground\-breaking, large GBP608,000,000 ESRC\-funded study, involving 5 researchers and 8 co\-researchers for 3 years, to examine this change from the perspectives of sex workers, customers, health and charity workers, police, policy makers and IT adult entertainment web platforms **\[R1–R5, G1\]**. The project was underpinned by participatory action research methods, recruiting and training sex workers to be co\-researchers throughout. The data sets included a 652\-response sex worker survey; a 1,352\-response customer survey; 62 interviews with sex workers; interviews with 53 police officers from 16 police forces; and interviews with 12 IT platform experts. Project outputs include a film for public engagement; tools and resources for practitioners; and guidance and safety resources for sex workers—written by sex workers. 

 The project was the first of its kind in the world, gaining significant international media and academic attention. Practitioner partners were involved at all stages of the project to ensure that the outcomes had a direct impact on policy and practice that was timely, relevant and feasible. Before this project, there was very limited knowledge of how the internet affected the working practices and safety of sex workers, or the implications for regulation. Findings have outlined several key issues, for example: 

-  Differences in the **diversity, characteristics and demographics** of sex workers using the internet in their work, compared with sex workers in other areas, such as street\-based work. 

-  Job satisfaction was high amongst online sex workers given the advantages of working virtually; however, there were also disadvantages such as isolation, stigma and the **fear** of being outed and breaches of privacy. 

-  An increase in **digitally facilitated crimes** such as doxing, harassment, stalking and unwanted contact. These were experienced by most participants, while other types of violence were reported less. 

-  The internet makes sex work **safer** and is now the prime space for interventions around safety, health and well\-being; yet online outreach is not widely harnessed by support projects. As a result, **netreach as a primary intervention** was established **\[R6\]**. 

-  The police are at an early stage in understanding online sex work, and often struggle to differentiate types of exploitation or trafficking. The need for a **nuanced understanding** of online sex work was established and interventions continue to be provided through training, guidance and tools. 

 *Beyond the Gaze* **\[G1\]**, a body of **recommendations and resources**—co\-produced with practitioners and sex workers—was made for police, practitioners, health commissioners and advocates. For example: 

1.  Safety Strategies for Online Sex Workers. 

1.  Privacy and Safety Tips published in four languages: English; Portuguese; Romanian; and Mandarin. 

1.  Practice Guidance for working with online sex workers and establishing a netreach intervention. 

1.  Five briefing papers: summary; for customers; for police; for practitioners; and mapping. 

1.  The Film *Online Sex Work in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century*: to enhance public understanding and demystify what sex work is.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Transforming the regulation of sex work** 

 Sanders’s research has developed clear recommendations for the regulation of sex work, both online and offline. These have underpinned developments in practice and policy, for example influencing new policing guidelines **\[E3, E8\]**. The National Police Chiefs’ Council stated: *“Professor Sanders’ research findings . . . were integral in shaping policy development and revision including in the re\-writing of the NPCC Sex Work and Prostitution Guidance”* **\[E3\]**. 

 This research has directly influenced the UK government’s agenda on sex work through contributions to influential policy briefings, such as her provision of oral evidence to the Women and Equalities Commission **\[E7\]**. The work is cited in the All Party Parliamentary Group on Prostitution and Global Sex Trade report, “Behind Closed Doors; Organised sexual exploitation in England and Wales” **\[E5\]**, and the Home Office and Office of South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner’s report, “The nature and prevalence of prostitution and sex work in England and Wales today” **\[E10\]**. Welsh Women‘s Aid and Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan’s “Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence Strategy 2018” committed to reviewing the findings of *Beyond the Gaze* **\[E9\]** and *Beyond the Gaze* research is cited extensively in the Department of Justice 2019 Review of the Criminalisation of Paying for Sexual Services in Northern Ireland **\[E6\]**. 

 Recommendations have been adopted by practitioners, specifically the National Crime Agency **\[E3, E4\]** and the National Police Chiefs’ Council with the College of Policing **\[E3, E8\]**. The National Police Chiefs’ Council stated: *“The creation of safety resources for police to use on welfare visits have been a direct benefit of working with the Beyond the Gaze project. After resources were produced in English, Romanian and Portuguese, and sent to all Chief Constables to cascade down, at the request of the Metropolitan police, resources were also made in Mandarin to reach the Chinese community. These resources have a direct impact on how police can engage with migrant sex workers and assess their vulnerable status. Such practical tools have been an invaluable resource which have assisted officers on the ground”* **\[E3\]**. 

 **Introducing a ground\-breaking practitioners forum, improving policy and practice** 

 National Ugly Mugs \(NUM\) – the UK’s leading charity supporting sex workers – has transformed its operational focus as a result of *Beyond the Gaze*, taking the national lead in educating police and practitioners and improving policy and practice of online sex work **\[E2, E3, E5\]**. As a consequence of the raised awareness of online crimes and safety resulting from the research, NUM has experienced an increase in sex worker membership by 4,100 new members, and an increase in reports of online abuse, stalking and harassment, rising by 23% in 2016, 36% in 2017, and 13% in 2018. The CEO of NUM stated: *“Between 2017 – 2018, when the BtG project \[was\] at its most visible, NUM experienced increased demands on our services as sex workers were calling in to report online harms, particularly stalking and harassment, with renewed hope that police would follow\-up this type of victimisation”* **\[E2\]**. 

 New mechanisms for supporting victims of crime have developed from the project, facilitated by a new digital platform at NUM **\[E2\]**. NUM leads training directly informed by *Beyond the Gaze* scholarship, to support cross\-agency awareness of the needs of online and offline sex workers. In partnership with NUM, training sessions have been delivered to 336 police across 16 forces; and to practitioners across England and Wales **\[E1, E3\]**. NUM have established a paid Research and Development advisory group staffed by ‘experts by experience’ who can progress the NUM business plan based on *Beyond the Gaze* findings **\[E2, E4\]**. 

 Training has changed operational practice in the police service, with the implementation of new strategies and interventions by specific police forces and the introduction of Special Point of Contact Officers/Dedicated Liaison Officers across the UK, who are using the resources created by *Beyond the Gaze* around privacy and safety to engage sex workers **\[E1a\]**. These Special Point of Contact Officers/Dedicated Liaison Officers are trained annually by Sanders, using evidence generated from *Beyond the Gaze*. **\[E1a, E3\]**. This training has transformed the approach taken to policing. The Inspector for the North Yorkshire Police Safeguarding and Vulnerability Unit stated: “ *It’s not so much changes, as there was nothing before. . . . \[A\]s a result we set up a sex worker working group . . . that’s got police representation . . . a safeguarding manager, health, and we’ve got someone from the Sexual Assault Referral Centre. . . . \[E\]very 24 hours \[we identify anything that\] might have been reported by a sex worker. . . . \[We\] review every single occurrence or incident reported by a sex worker to make sure that that offence has been properly investigated and that that sex worker has been treated with dignity and respect”* **\[E1a\]**. 

  

 Sanders has designed and introduced a sector\-wide Practitioner Forum \(sexual health, independent sexual violence advisers, victim case workers, trainers, community development workers, and outreach workers\) to improve the quality of evidence\-based decision making and practice development across the working practices, regulation and public understanding of online sex work **\[E4, E1c\]**. This is currently the only forum/network of its kind providing much needed interactions between often\-isolated practitioners across the UK. The Forum has acted quickly to move to a virtual format to address COVID restrictions and new ways of online networking. 

 Sanders’s research influences the everyday practices of police leads, local and national regulation experts and support workers, having demonstrated that online advertising platforms such as Vivastreet and Adultwork provide a digital footprint that enables criminal behaviour to be traced and can warn sex workers about potentially dangerous clients **\[E1\]**. These changes have improved online sex worker access to support and advice about safe working practices and facilitated the development of online support services **\[E1b. E4, E11\]**. 

 **Developing new strategies to support the health and wellbeing of sex workers** 

 Evidence from *Beyond the Gaze* has directly influenced how health and wellbeing practitioners engage with the online sex work community. Practitioners reported a range of changes instituted since their involvement with *Beyond the Gaze* **\[E1b, E1c\]**. The Senior Sister of GUM at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust stated: *“It’s definitely changed our practice \[and\] the focus of our work was on street sex workers and therefore . . . there was a huge group of people that we weren’t even reaching . . . \[our GUM service\] only saw females so we changed that as well to look at males and trans too”.* **\[E1b\]**. The CEO of a sex worker project stated: “ *We had to change how we do netreach, as a result of the information we found out . . . it led us to look at how we as an organisation . . . use marketing in general to meet potential clients \[and make them\] aware of the services that we offer. I think previously, we were very, very behind on doing that”* **\[E1c\]**. 

 Fifty four training sessions have been delivered to 450 health, outreach and charity professionals since 2016, plus individual consultancy on more than 30 projects to advise on their digital netreach strategy. These spanned outreach, health and wellbeing services and charities across the UK and Ireland, including Leeds, Merseyside/Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, Cleveland, Leicester, Dublin and Cork. Since March 2020, these requests for interventions and guidance to set up netreach to respond to COVID have been intense, with more than 30 projects benefiting from direct guidance. As a result, working practices have changed with many practitioners reporting that they have been influenced to develop digital strategies to address the local needs of sex workers. In 2019, Chrysalis, a harm reduction charity based in Dublin, developed a new online outreach service in Dublin using the findings, resources and practitioner guidance from *Beyond the Gaze* **\[E11\]**. A Case Manager, Chrysalis Community Drug Project, stated: “ *without . . . building up my own knowledge base through* Beyond the Gaze *, \[I don’t think\] that I necessarily would have started looking in that direction \[netreach/digital\] and then we developed the website as part of that”* **\[E1b\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Affecting approximately 10,000,000 people in the UK, arthritis is a leading cause of pain and disability in daily activities and at work. In order to reduce the burden on the NHS, growing pressure is being placed on individuals and society to self\-manage this long\-term condition. In response, Salford’s research team designed, developed and tested a suite of arthritis\-specific clinical assessments to unravel the myriad ways in which this condition can affect individuals so that tailored self\-management strategies could be devised. Innovative treatments were developed and tested for their clinical efficacy and cost\-effectiveness, as well as ease of implementation in the NHS. Findings were utilised to inform treatment policy, guidelines and clinical practice changes. This has led to improvements in rehabilitation services for people with arthritis, an upskilling of health professionals in rheumatology and cost savings across the NHS. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Timely assessment and interventions are key to preventing disability from arthritis. Researchers at Salford addressed the gap in the use of Patient Reported Outcome Measures \(PROMs\) in clinical assessment and evidence\-based treatments of the difficulties people with arthritis experience during daily activities and at work. There was a particular focus on hand pain and loss of function due to chronic pain and fatigue, since this prevents participation in daily life and paid work. Our research findings underpinning the impact of these studies are grouped across five themes: 

 **2.1. Changes in arthritis glove use leading to savings for the NHS** 

 Arthritis \(compression\) gloves are commonly provided in the NHS to people with inflammatory arthritis. These apply pressure and warmth, relieving hand pain and stiffness and improving hand function. However, there was little evidence to support their use. A National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\)\-funded multi\-centred randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) was carried out at Salford \(2014 **–** 2018\) to test effectiveness, in terms of use and cost, of the commonly used arthritis gloves against control \(placebo\) gloves. Findings showed that arthritis gloves had higher costs but comparable benefits to control gloves. At a cost of GBP83,700 to gain one quality\-adjusted life year \(QALY\), they were judged not to be cost\-effective **\[3.1\]**. 

 **2.2. Standardisation of PROMs in rheumatology to aid clinical assessment and evaluation** 

 Clinicians’ understanding of the effect of arthritis and its treatment on patients’ daily lives is poor. PROMs assess the quality of care delivered to NHS patients from the patient perspective. NHS therapists are encouraged to utilise standardised, validated PROMs to assess their patients, devise a treatment programme through shared decision making and evaluate their interventions more precisely. Within rheumatology, there was a gap in valid and reliable PROMs to enable this. We developed a suite of PROMs for a British population of adults with arthritis to aid clinical assessment. Testing the use of these PROMs across multiple rheumatic and musculoskeletal conditions showed they are easy to complete, valid, reliable and comprehensive. Therefore, they were recommended for clinical and research use to assess upper limb functioning and participation in daily activities and at work **\[3.2, 3.3\]**. 

 **2.3. NHS prioritisation of patients’ arthritis\-related work problems** 

 Arthritis leads to work disability, sickness leave and loss of productivity at work. We developed and tested the effectiveness, in terms of application and cost, of a brief work rehabilitation intervention delivered through a multi\-centred pilot RCT. The project demonstrated that job retention work rehabilitation helps people with arthritis to stay in employment and can be cost\-effective. As a result, it is a credible and acceptable intervention to provide in the NHS for people with arthritis who have concerns about continuing to work in the future **\[3.4\]**. 

 **2.4. Improving clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction for people with fibromyalgia** 

 Fibromyalgia affects one in 20 people in the UK, but it is more common among people who have Rheumatoid Arthritis \(RA\). This often leads to difficulties in treating arthritis. Clinical guidelines recommend non\-pharmacological treatment modalities, as there is no scientific evidence to support effective medical treatment. However, access to non\-pharmacological therapies are limited in the NHS. We designed a 6\-week evidence\-based Fibromyalgia Self\-Management Education \(FAMe\) Group Programme for people with fibromyalgia and trained specialist occupational therapists to deliver this standardised programme over two years. Following the adoption of this programme across two hospital sites, a Service Evaluation of the programme was conducted at the Mid Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust. Findings showed significant improvements on chronic widespread pain, fatigue, mood management and self\-efficacy of the patients who attended **\[3.5\]**. 

 **2.5. Increasing access to self\-management through ePROMs and online technologies** 

 Patient information and education have been shown to improve pain and self\-efficacy while increasing overall quality of life in people with arthritis. Informed patients are better able to distinguish and manage symptoms, use treatments effectively, access required services, manage work and cope better with the psychological impact of their conditions. Electronic PROMs \(ePROMs\) are online questionnaires which ask patients to self\-rate their health status. However, existing ePROMs in rheumatology for rehabilitation \(e.g. daily living activities and work assessments\) were either not scientifically validated or not freely accessible to the general population of people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases \(RMDs\) or health professionals \(e.g. occupational therapists/physiotherapists in rheumatology departments\) unless their Trust subscribed to costly systems. Even existing ePROMs were limited to treatment duration, whereas self\-management of long\-term conditions requires life\-long management. Helped by Public and Patient Involvement \(PPIE\), we developed and tested the usability and acceptability of an online self\-management platform \( [mskhub.com](https://mskhub.com/)\) for people with arthritis to help them access valid and reliable self\-assessment using Salford’s suite of ePROMs to provide tailored self\-management advice and online patient education programmes **\[3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1. Changes in arthritis glove use leading to savings for the NHS** 

 Salford’s award\-winning randomised clinical trial **\[3.1\]** demonstrated that the costlier Isotoner arthritis gloves \(the commonest type in the UK\), provided by therapists to one in three patients with RA and Early Inflammatory Arthritis in the NHS, were no more effective than the cheaper placebo versions, which did not apply any compression. This meant that therapists could instead recommend that patients try warm, fingerless gloves with Lycra, available on the high street, to gain the same benefit as arthritis/compression gloves previously provided by the NHS. 

 These findings led to **immediate clinical practice changes** across the <ins>17 NHS Trusts</ins> who took part in the study, as well as provision of more **patient education and promotion of hand exercises** instead of gloves prescription, and ultimately resulted in **savings on the cost of stocking and prescribing** **these specialist gloves** within Trusts **\[5.1\]**. The changes have been **incorporated within the advice** given for arthritis gloves at the <ins>Royal College of Occupational Therapists’</ins> *Hand and Wrist Orthoses for Adults with Rheumatological Conditions Practice Guidelines* \(2<sup>nd</sup> edition\) **\[5.2\]**, which governs all relevant occupational therapy practice across the UK. **Changes to the prescription of arthritis gloves** were also acknowledged in the *Oxford Handbook of Musculoskeletal Nursing* \(2<sup>nd</sup> edition\), with reference made to the A\-Gloves study findings **\[5.2. p. 588\]**. This handbook is an essential companion for all nurses and allied health professionals seeking the latest evidence\-based treatments for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal conditions. Specialist clinical training programmes in rheumatology, which certify all qualified health professionals in rheumatology across Europe through the <ins>British Society of Rheumatology \(BSR</ins><ins>\)</ins> and <ins>European League Against Rheumatism \(EULAR\)</ins> also **changed the advice provided on the use of arthritis gloves** to inform specialists that the efficacy of this treatment is not supported **\[5.2\]**. This recommendation was also **incorporated into the online self\-management course app ‘My Arthritis’** developed by the <ins>National</ins> <ins>Rheumatoid Arthritis Society \(NRAS\)</ins> and social enterprise <ins>Ampersand Health</ins>, freely available to anyone with inflammatory conditions looking for self\-management advice **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.2. Standardisation of PROMs in rheumatology to aid clinical assessment and evaluation** 

 PROMs are essential for clinicians to quantify the impact and severity of rheumatic diseases on patients’ lives to make appropriate management decisions. However, there was a paucity in disease\-specific PROMs in rheumatology and a growing need for sensitive\-to\-change, valid and reliable outcome measures to aid treatment plans and evaluation of rehabilitation interventions. 

 Salford’s research programme for developing and testing PROMs in rheumatology **\[3.3\]** has led to **increased use of standardised, linguistically and culturally validated, disease\-specific PROMs** in rheumatology across the <ins>rheumatology rehabilitation departments in the NHS</ins> **\[5.3\]** in line with NHS evidence\-based practice recommendations. As these PROMs are also made freely available for patients to access for self\-assessment on mskhub.com **\[3.6, 5.4\]**, this led to **more effective use of therapists’ time in clinics** and the **empowerment of patients** through being involved in their own clinical assessment, described as being *‘invaluable’* **\[5.5\]**. These PROMs were subsequently translated into several other languages \(including German, Turkish, Czech, Swedish\) for testing and have been **implemented in practice in Turkey** **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.3. NHS prioritisation of patients’ arthritis\-related work problems** 

 Work problems are not traditionally discussed at clinical appointments in rheumatology. The widespread use of work assessments and interventions developed at Salford and implemented through mskhub.com showed that a brief vocational rehabilitation intervention can **help people with arthritis to stay at work** **\[5.3\]**. 

 Training resources born from this research helped to **upskill the NHS therapy workforce** **to start delivering work interventions** across NHS Trusts in the UK **\[5.7\]** subsequently leading to widescale **prioritisation of arthritis\-related work problems**. This development in practice led to large, national organisations \(e.g. <ins>Public Health England \(PHE\)</ins>\), professional bodies \(e.g. <ins>Royal College of Occupational Therapists \(RCOT\)</ins>\) and arthritis charities \(e.g. <ins>Versus Arthritis</ins>\) **changing their agendas to campaign for the NHS to prioritise work problems** in clinical assessments to help people stay employed **\[5.8, 5.9\].** Salford researchers carried out the first phase of evaluation, which revealed that in a six\-month period 487 staff were in training and there was a **statistically significant improvement in their knowledge and confidence** to talk about employment in their clinical services **\[5.8\]**. The project also had a positive impact on the Health and Work champions’ personal and professional development. Work outcomes are now becoming part of **standard clinical assessment and intervention delivery in the NHS**. One of these initiatives was the <ins>PHE and RCOT\-led ‘Work Champions’ initiative</ins> that encouraged therapists to ask work\-related questions of their patients, as work outcomes were not routinely measured in rheumatology services **\[5.8\]**. The evaluation of this programme recommended the implementation of this initiative England\-wide in NHS Trusts to prioritise work assessments for people with chronic and long\-term conditions, including arthritis. As a result of this, **all the NHS Trusts in England are now progressing towards including work outcomes within their standard clinical assessments** **\[5.9\]**. 

 **4.4. Improving clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction for people with fibromyalgia** 

 A Service Evaluation of the Fibromyalgia Self\-Management Education \(FAMe\) Group Programme **\[3.5\]** led to the rolling\-out of the programme across two hospitals under the Mid Cheshire NHS Trust \(2018 – 2020\). 

 This programme **reduced waiting lists** \(n=200\+\) and **improved patient and clinical outcomes** **\[5.3\]**. During the COVID\-19 pandemic, chronic pain\-related face\-to\-face services were suspended in NHS rheumatology departments across the UK. Mid Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust subsequently digitised the FAMe Group Programme **\[3.5\]** into an **open access, online self\-management education programme** \(FAMe Online\), hosted via mskhub.com, to **enable patients to have continued access \[5.3, 5.5, 5.10\]**. This led to **rapid uptake from other NHS Trusts in England** \(including the <ins>Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust</ins> and the <ins>Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust</ins> in the first two weeks\) **\[5.10\]**. As the resource was shared through clinical networks, social media and webinars held by the <ins>British Society for Rheumatology</ins>, uptake of the online programme from community\-based adults with fibromyalgia is now UK\-wide. 

 **4.5. Increasing access to self\-management through ePROMs and online technologies** 

 The design and implementation of the online self\-management platform mskhub.com **\[3.6\]** with PPIE and health professionals’ involvement means that this system is both easy to engage with and adhere to. 

 An **increased proportion of the general population of adults with RMDs** now access self\-management and patient education through mskhub.com, helping to **reduce time spent on assessments and paperwork within the NHS** as a result **\[5.3, 5.5, 5.10\]**. **Use of mskhub.com has** **doubled during the COVID\-19 pandemic**, as increasing numbers of health professionals started signposting NHS patients to mskhub.com for remote assessment through ePROMs and self\-management advice **\[5.3, 5.10\]**. By saving time spent on assessment in clinics, these ePROMs **help clinicians to spend more time with patients** on shared decision making, goal setting and evaluation of their interventions. Online self\-management programmes such as the FAMe Online helped approximately **500 NHS patients with fibromyalgia to access treatment remotely** during the pandemic, instead of remaining on waiting lists until the face\-to\-face rehabilitation programmes become available in the NHS in 2021 **\[5.10\]**. Free online training programmes and resources made available for health professionals on mskhub.com also helped them to **deliver remote work rehabilitation assessment and treatment** during the pandemic. Equally, mskhub.com is utilised by the general population of adults with arthritis and/or joint pain and problems to **prevent hospitalisation and aid self\-management** **\[5.10\]**.

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Global environmental pressures are increasing to avoid the opening of new oil wells and to optimise outputs from existing wells. Existing technologies can only recover less than one third of the reserves that they reach due to ingress of water or gas. ERPE researchers at Heriot\-Watt University investigated and modelled an innovative intelligent Autonomous Inflow Control Valve technology \(AICV®\) within a multi\-partner industry consortium, led by the Norwegian limited company InflowControl AS \(InflowControl\). Impacts arising include: 

 \(A\) – AICV technology is now mass\-manufactured in multi\-country supply chains including the UK and has been installed in over 100 petroleum industry wells worldwide; 

 \(B\) – InflowControl, a start\-up company in Norway, now with a USD 17 Million turnover; 

 \(C\) – Oil recovery has been enhanced, where AICV is deployed, by an average of 38% with consequent increases in revenue and savings in production costs; 

 \(D\) – New knowledge and practice across the international industry sector deriving from the ERPE parametric approach to optimising AICV deployment; and 

 \(E\) \- Water ingress and co\-produced waste can be reduced by up to 89% with consequent positive environmental impact.

# 1.  Underpinning research 

 Enhancing oil recovery \(EOR\) from existing wells is a strategic aim of the UK Government Oil and Gas Authority, the European Union and international bodies, and a key imperative for multi\-national and national oil companies and their supporting supply chains, including many Small to Medium Enterprises \(SMEs\). Environmental pressures require production companies to increase and optimise outputs from existing wells rather than open new ones. Around the world, however, only 32% of the available reserves are extracted from existing oil fields, leaving 68% behind. A major challenge in oil production is to enhance and maximise the total oil recovery from the reservoir. Such low oil recovery rates are mostly due to ingress of water or gas into the well.  In the early 1990s, the oil industry introduced Inflow Control Devices \(ICDs\) to passively control the influx of fluids into a well. Multiple ICDs restrict flow inside a petroleum production well to improve its productivity. Field experience demonstrated that ICDs could only balance the well influx initially but, being passive, could not adapt to the changes in the inflow conditions as the well matured over its production life. To reduce water and gas ingress, known as ‘breakthrough’, on an ongoing basis over the lifetime of the well required the development of active, rather than passive, control. 

 This led to the development of Autonomous Inflow Control Valve \(AICV\) technology that would require pioneering ERPE complex modelling of the geo\-statistical features of different reservoir geologies and production inflows to ensure that their deployment was effective. 

 Development of this new AICV technology was enabled by a collaborative, interdisciplinary effort. The EU Framework 7 REVIVAL project \[P1\] \(2013\-2015\) was completed by a European consortium of four SMEs, one large company and three research and technology developers \(RTDs\), with Heriot\-Watt University \(HWU\) as the lead university. The consortium was led by InflowControl, a Norwegian company that was the primary inventor of AICV technology. 

 As one of the world leaders in inflow control technology research, ERPE prior studies \(2001\-2013\) underpinned the research in REVIVAL. An ERPE Joint Industry Project \(JIP\) ‘Added value from Intelligent Well Technology’ started in 2001, supported by an international consortium of petroleum operator and service companies. By 2013 this project and its multiple successors, funded by over 20 oil companies, produced over 40 publications on inflow control technology. Notable contributions, relevant to the subsequent REVIVAL’s AICVs studies, included: 

 \[3.1\], 2005 – was the first research to relate the geostatistical features of different geology reservoirs to their suitability for the flow control device technology. The REVIVAL project’s AICV suitability for various oil field geologies was informed by this research. 

 \[3.2\], 2007 – this research thoroughly reviewed the application, modelling, and evaluation of the types of inflow control device technology in oil and gas fields. This technology assessment framework was later extended to include REVIVAL’s AICV studies. 

 \[3.3\], 2010 – these studies developed comprehensive analysis, assessment, application, modelling, and screening of all the inflow control device technology types commercially available at the time. This work was a fundamental enabler of ERPE REVIVAL studies that compared the performance of AICVs to other earlier ICDs and demonstrated the AICVs’ potential advantages, leading to their adoption by the industry. 

 **ERPE contribution to REVIVAL \(2013\-2015\):** 

 ERPE modelled the long\-term, oil recovery benefit of the AICV technology and defined and quantified the criteria that determined the suitability of an oil\-field for AICV deployment.  The ERPE team led the development of a reservoir recovery model for AICVs that assessed their necessary flow performance, evaluated their application envelope and quantified their long\-term benefits at oil\-field scale. This was vital to assess the potential of AICV for improving oil recovery and thereupon in justifying the investment in AICV technology. The stages of the work were as follows: 

 In Stage 1, comprehensive research delivered the first collected appraisal of all available types of flow control devices in use and identified where an AICV was best\-suited and most economically able to increase yield. 

 In Stage 2, AICV performance modelling approaches were critically analysed and a parametric basis developed to determine how they could immediately be used in several leading, commercial, reservoir simulators. The parametrised AICV flow model that ERPE developed also enabled optimisation of AICV performance to achieve a required reservoir response \(later related to the quantity of its ‘good’ and ‘bad’ water or gas flows \(as explained below\). 

 In Stage 3, the approach was also applied to multiple generic reservoir models to demonstrate the potential benefit and application envelope of the AICV technology, and to provide appropriate guidelines on its assessment and adoption \[3.5\]. 

 The ERPE modelling of a wide range of possible generic oil fields, geologies, fluid properties, and production scenarios informed the engineering design and optimisation of AICV technologies within the REVIVAL consortium. 

 In Stage 4, the above work was extended to derive and produce a novel, generalised approach to modelling, evaluation and fast optimisation of flow performance of any type of AICV. This used 3D mapping of a parametrised response to a given reservoir and was illustrated for AICVs in heavy oil reservoirs \[3.6\]. 

 The ERPE team showed that the AICV technology would promote the flow of ‘good water’ \(i.e. the level of unwanted fluid acceptable in the efficient oil production in wells\) while restricting the ‘bad water’ \(i.e. the level of unwanted fluid adversely affecting the oil production performance in wells\), and how the AICV flow performance should behave to achieve this \[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]. This informed the AICV engineering design of the REVIVAL consortium that was able to achieve the optimal AICV flow performance.

# 1.  Details of the impact 

 Lift, processing, transportation, storage and disposal of unwanted fluids \(i.e. trapped water and gas in the geological reservoirs\) co\-produced with oil is one of the most expensive, energy consuming and environmentally unfriendly activities in petroleum production. It is also a key factor limiting the quantity of oil recovered during production. The range of impacts resulting from the ERPE research resulted in not only in a **world\-first** **new technology** that significantly reduced this co\-produced residue but also delivered a **series of multi\-partner country economic, business and environmental impacts** as follows. 

 **\(A\) Development of a multi\-country partnership supply chain for AICVs** 

 The primary objective of the REVIVAL project was to develop an innovative low\-cost, high\-performance Autonomous Inflow Control Valve to enable increased recovery of oil by preventing breakthrough of water and gas into the oil well. ERPE research \[3.4\-3.6\] underpinned this development and led to a multi country partnership to manufacture and commercially test the AICV technology including: InflowControl \(Norway\), HP Etch \(Sweden\), International Syalons \(UK\), Seal Engineering \(Norway\), RT Filter Technike \(Germany\), Norner \(Norway\) \[5.1\]. Today, ‘ *InflowControl sources the AICV parts from suppliers in Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK and Switzerland, and assembles these parts in Norway to produce the AICV*’ \[5.2\]. 

 **\(B\) World First Installation and Company Growth** 

 InflowControl was a new start\-up company in Norway. As a result of the ERPE modelling, the benefits of the technology were quantified, the technology was adopted and the world’s first installation of the AICV occurred in August 2015 \[5.3\]. InflowControl confirmed that, by November 2020, AICVs had been ‘ *installed in over 100 wells worldwide’* \[5.4\] and the 2019\-20 turnover for InflowControl from AICV technology and deployment had been circa USD17,000,000 \[5.1\]. 

 **\(C\) Economic Impact with International Reach** 

 Each oil field may typically require 100 valves \[5.2\] and the AICV modelling designed and developed by the ERPE team demonstrated \[3.4\] the positive impact of the AICV on the oil production and recovery rates, allowing full economic justification and payback to be clearly provided for different reservoirs/customers \[5.1, 5.5\]. 

 Provision of quantifiable evidence from the ERPE reservoir simulation model assisted in overcoming a major marketing barrier by allowing customers to model the additional cost/benefits offered by the novel AICV system for their oil fields \[5.1\]. The CEO of InflowControl has stated that the ‘ *research helped to* *identify and develop the best approach to model the performance of a well completed with AICVs in one or more reservoir simulator\(s\).*’ \[5.1\]. The modelling also demonstrated the ability of the AICV technology to improve the production and recovery rates, enabling more complete economic appraisal of reservoirs to a wider customer base \[5.1\]. This enabled InflowControl to grow substantial global reach: 

 \- By late 2020 inflow client companies were installing the AICV in ‘ *Canada, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Oman, Norway, Bahrain and China. The AICV® wells cover a large number of applications, onshore and offshore, carbonate and sand stone, new and retrofit, ultra\-light, light, medium, heavy and extra heavy oil for gas, steam, CO<sub>2</sub> and/or water choking/shut\-of*f’ \[5.6\]. Further, the technology has demonstrated significant increase in oil production of 38% on average \[5.4\]. In some cases, depending on the geology and other characteristics of the oil field the AICV can increase oil recovery from 50% to 80% \[5.2\]. 

 \- InflowControl reported operational cost savings for a client in the Middle East in 2020, for one field alone in the ‘first year’ of operation, of USD2,000,000, with a ‘water cut’ reduction of 68%, \(due to reduced water handling costs\). Oil recovery from the existing wells as a result of the AICV deployment was enhanced by 18% \[5.7\]. 

 \- Another major operator with one of the largest fields in the world had areas of the field that could not be recovered, due to an excessively high Gas Oil Ratio \(GOR\). After fitting AICVs in a well, the GOR *‘reduced by over 85%’*, resulting in significantly enhanced oil recovery \[5.8\]. 

 \- In a Middle East AICV deployment, ‘ *within the first 12 months of the well having been brought on line with the AICV retrofit completion, the operator earned a net gain of over 51 times the cost of the retrofit completion, including rig costs’* \[5.9\] 

 **\(D\) Optimisation Modelling and Knowledge Exchange for AICV Deployment** 

 The ERPE underpinning research \[3.4\-3.6\] showed how the AICV technology and modelling could be deployed successfully while also ‘adding value’ when compared to existing passive valve control technologies and approaches. This evidence through reservoir simulation models supported the InflowControl marketing strategy and the additional cost/benefits offered by the novel AICV system. With \[3.4\-3.6\] and an early consultancy project for Woodside Energy by ERPE \[5.5\], to assess the future potential of the AICV, the engineering design process was informed across the consortium partners, which was previously stated by the CEO of InflowControl as ‘ *helping to identify and develop the best approach to model the performance of a well completed with AICVs in one or more reservoir simulator\(s\)*.’ \[5.1\]. The ERPE findings and partnership with InflowControl has also been disseminated widely through the international network called the ‘InflowControl Forum’ supporting knowledge exchange involving major oil and engineering companies such as Total, Chevron, Shell & Halliburton \[5.10\] 

 **\(E\) Positive Environmental Impact** 

 Water and gas trapped in the geological reservoirs, co\-produced with oil, is one of the most expensive, energy consuming and environmentally unfriendly activities in the petroleum business. Over 75% of fluid produced from oil reservoirs today is dirty water.  ERPE researchers were the first to quantify the long\-term potential of AICV technology to restrict inflow of unwanted fluids \(improving environmental outcomes\) and enhance oil recovery. Based on the results from the REVIVAL project, the performance and the functionality of the AICV were compared to competing technologies. The significant advantage of this AICV compared to the passively controlled valves is that it can operate actively and, if necessary, close completely to prevent breakthrough of unwanted fluids.  Enhancing oil recovery and reducing co\-produced waste reduces significantly the direct environmental impacts and importantly also reduces the operational carbon footprint \[5.1\] through reduced unwanted water/gas handling with consequent economic cost savings. InflowControl reported in 2020 that, across the range of client projects with AICV installations, *‘the gas oil ratio \(GOR\) and/or water cut \(WC\) had been reduced significantly’* \(by 89% on average\) \[5.4\]. This has supported the environmental marketing aspects for InflowControl to their clients “ *Environmental benefits are achieved by reducing gas and water production, which supports companies goals of being less carbon intensive within their total production operations”* \[5.11\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 School\-based teacher education, where experienced teachers have responsibility for the professional learning and development of student teachers, has increased markedly in recent years. University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) research exploring the challenges facing school\-based teacher educators \(SBTEs\) and identifying their professional development needs has had an impact on policy and practice in the UK and overseas. The research shaped key elements of new national standards, published by the UK Government, to improve the consistency and quality of school\-based mentoring for trainee teachers, and a new professional framework for teacher educators, published by a national association that reaches 10,000 trainee teachers. UH’s White and Dickerson translated their insights on challenges experienced by teacher educators into novel online professional development resources that have been widely used by SBTEs, teacher education providers and their partner schools, and practitioner associations internationally. This has resulted in qualitative evidence of significant impact on professional practice and learning. Adapted for Dutch speakers, these resources have also influenced teacher education practice in the Netherlands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Following far\-reaching educational reforms introduced in 2010, the UK Government has relocated 50% of initial teacher education from Higher Education Institutions into schools in England \(Department for Education \(DfE\), 2017\). A similar shift towards school\-based teacher education also occurred in other OECD countries. This has led to an increase in the number of school\-based teacher educators \(SBTEs\), who have been asked to assume greater responsibility for the professional learning and development of student teachers and mentors. SBTEs have a particularly complex dual role of teaching both pupils and student\-teachers, often without access to a community of practice. While SBTE roles have diversified in response to these rapid structural changes in teacher education, many countries have no relevant professional learning policy. The European Commission’s 2013 report *Supporting Teacher Educators for better learning outcomes* observed: ‘ *Teacher educators are crucial players for maintaining – and improving – the high quality of the teaching workforce… Yet they are often neglected in policy\-making, meaning … teacher educators do not always get the support and challenge they need … in terms of their education and professional development*.’ 

 Responding to this policy context, and recognising that SBTEs significantly influence the quality of teacher, and therefore classroom, education, White and Dickerson led a research programme exploring the learning and practice of professionals responsible for educating new teachers in schools. Their qualitative research sought to first understand the wider issue and then provide practical, deliverable solutions. Studies identified the experiences and learning needs of SBTEs, and those working in partnership with them, through interviews, questionnaires, reflective journals, student\-teacher focus groups and stories of practice. The findings made the following contributions to the knowledge base: SBTEs need different professional knowledge from teachers and from university\-based teacher educators; and dialogue is more effective than providing written resources alone to support their understanding of effective teaching approaches with student teachers \[ **3.1**\]. 

 The research indicated personal benefits of the teacher educator experience: building their capacity to lead continuing professional development \(CPD\) for their colleagues by growing their confidence; re\-igniting a passion for pedagogy through increased engagement; and improving their classroom practice through becoming more reflective practitioners \[ **3.2**\]. It also revealed the value that student teachers place on the complementary contributions of teacher educators from school and university to their learning, but there were concerns over the lack of recognition of the SBTE role. Developing professional knowledge is more challenging for SBTEs than university\-based teacher educators as they may not have the requisite professional support through a teacher educator community of practice *.* This indicated a need for such a community whilst SBTEs are developing their new role \[ **3.1**\]. The research made it clear that the dual role of SBTE and teacher adds greater complexity for the development of teacher educators’ identity and confidence. The findings suggested that in developing high quality initial teacher education it is more important to focus on the development of the teacher educators than to be concerned about who employs them or the location of their work, and to recognise that <ins>all</ins> teacher educators have development needs and benefit from working together \[ **3.3**, **3.4**\]. 

 These findings led to collaborative research, from July 2017, with Dr Miranda Timmermans, Applied Professor at Avans University of Applied Sciences \(Breda, Netherlands\) and Chair of the Dutch Association of Teacher Educators \(VELON\); similar issues exist for Dutch and English SBTEs. The team collected teacher educators’ narratives on challenges experienced ‘on the ground’ in their professional practice \[ **3.5**. **3.6**\]. The stories revealed complexities of working across institutional borders with multiple stakeholders. Many teacher educators sought their own solution rather than discussing the challenges with others in the partnership. The stories provided authentic teacher educator voices for use as a professional learning tool in developing collaborative practices in initial teacher education partnerships \[ **3.5**, **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research by White and Dickerson into the role, experiences and learning needs of SBTEs has informed policy frameworks at European and national level that facilitate the professional development of teacher educators. Their findings were translated into learning resources and tools that have supported English and Dutch\-speaking SBTEs in developing their practice to enhance the quality of school\-based teacher education. Beneficiaries of the research include: DfE policymakers; SBTEs; further and higher education institutions; initial teacher education providers; national and international teacher education associations. 

 **Informing the development of national\-level policy** 

 In 2015 the Secretary of State for Education asked an expert group, chaired by the Teaching Schools Council, to develop new national standards to bring greater coherence and consistency to school\-based mentoring arrangements for trainee teachers. In response to an invitation, White and Dickerson submitted written evidence based on the research in **3.3**. In their submission, White and Dickerson identified the key skills and attributes that mentors need. These included approachability; sensitivity for working with adults of differing personalities and development needs; an ability to support trainees to critically reflect on their own practice \[ **5.1**, p19\]. They highlighted the benefits to mentors from having this role. These included: the opportunity to deconstruct and articulate their practice for their own professional development; develop transferable skills in lesson observation, feedback, mentoring and coaching; engage with the research community to further improve their practice \[ **5.1**, p20\]. The resulting *National Standards for school\-based initial teacher training mentors*, published by the Government in July 2016, incorporated key elements of the UH evidence \[ **5.1**\]. The document included: ‘… *effective training supports mentors to further improve their practice by training them in how to deconstruct and articulate their practice*’ \[ **5.1**, p7\]. It said: ‘ *Trainees should use the standards to … develop transferable skills, for example, in lesson observation and feedback’* \[ **5.1**, p10\]. The Standards specified that mentors should ‘ *be approachable*’ and ‘ *encourage the trainee to reflect on their practice*’ \[ **5.1**, p11\]. They also said mentors should engage with academic research to develop their own mentoring practice and enable trainees ‘ *to access, utilise and interpret robust educational research to inform their teaching*’ \[ **5.1**, p12\]. 

 The research led by White ‘ *made a significant contribution*’ to a new policy framework designed by The National Association of School\-Based Teacher Trainers \(NASBTT\) to enhance the professional development of SBTEs \[ **5.2**\]. NASBTT is a registered charity that represents School\-Centred Initial Teacher Training \(SCITT\) providers, School Direct Lead Schools, Teaching Schools and HEIs. It has more than 200 members representing in excess of 10,000 trainees; its members include 96% of accredited SCITTs \[ **5.2**\]. Based on her research, White helped NASBTT to develop its *Professional Framework for Teacher Educators* in 2019, which underpinned NASBTT’s subsequent publication of practical tools and resources \(further details in the next sub section on developing practice\). This marked ‘ *the first time NASBTT has provided courses, resources and a framework specifically to support the professional learning of school\-based teacher educators, and this provision is unique within England*’ \[ **5.2**\]. The UH research was also cited in a 2017 report by not\-for\-profit advocacy organisation Cambridge Primary Review Trust that sought to present evidence for strengthening initial teacher training in primary schools. *Policy and Research Evidence in the ‘Reform’ of Primary Initial Teacher Education in England* cited **3.2** and **3.3** seven times throughout the report \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Developing the professional practice of school\-based teacher educators** 

 White and Dickerson used their research findings and insights to create a novel, evidence\-based, online CPD resource *For Learning in Teacher Education* \(FLiTE\). This resource comprises a set of 12 stories that cover challenges in practice in initial teacher education partnerships; the stories represent real scenarios \(collected from teacher educators during the research process\) designed to provoke reflection, facilitate discussion, and support development of professional practice.  Each story is cross\-referenced to the DfE’s national standards. The FLiTE platform is aimed at both practitioners and training/education providers and has four main objectives: 

-  Inspire critical reflection on school\-based practice in teacher education; 

-  Deepen the professional learning and development of teacher educators; 

-  Develop collaborative working in initial teacher education partnerships; 

-  Enhance the quality of learning opportunities for student teachers. 

 White and Dickerson publicised the FLiTE resources through social media, professional associations and teacher educator networks. Between its launch in December 2018 and 31 December 2020 there were 1,107 direct downloads of the resources from the FLiTE website \[ **5.4**\]. White worked with NASBTT to develop a suite of Teacher Educator Programmes \(TEP\) designed to provide professional development for teacher educators at all stages of their careers. The FLiTE resources were used for the TEP Level 3 Programme, which focuses on developing the skills of senior mentors who train other teacher educators in the TEP Level 1 and TEP Level 2 Programmes \[ **5.2**\]. The Level 3 mentors reported that they would use FLiTE resources in the Level 1 training \[ **5.2**\]. The Level 3 programme lead said that delegates ‘ *really liked the stories*’ and ‘ *could see that the stories would be good \[for\] Level 1 ... \(i.e. mentor training\) ... \[t\]hey felt that the scenarios provided a helpful alternative approach*’ to role playing \[ **5.5**\]. She felt that the FLiTE resources ‘... *provoked the teacher educators' thinking about their understanding of the mentor role and the role of training trainees*’ \[ **5.5**\]. NASBTT’s *Professional Framework for Teacher Educators* \(covered in the previous policy sub section\), which White helped to develop, underpinned the Association’s Teacher Educator and Mentoring Zone \(TEMZ\), launched in April 2020. Made available to all NASBTT members, TEMZ houses a suite of professional development materials and signposts to the FLiTE resources \[ **5.2**\]. 

 The resources were used in workshops hosted by the International Professional Development Association; Association for Teacher Education in Europe; the UH Network of Teacher Educators \(a 68\-member community of practice launched by White\); Universities’ Council for the Education of Teachers; and European Association for Practitioner Research on Improving Learning. Feedback included: ‘ *Narrative: so specific but in the same time so general. It touches us all. We could all identify/contribute*’; ‘... *has certainly made me reflect on this situation – would I handle it differently now?*’ \[ **5.6**\]. In 2019, SBTEs working with UH \(over 500 schools, 465 active in 2019\) evaluated the resources. Comments included: ‘… *liking the focus on professional development and quality assurance*’ ; ‘… *working through one of the FLiTE stories…has been absolutely fantastic. The quality of discussion that it provoked, and the thinking has just been invaluable to the professional mentors*’ \[ **5.6**\]. During a professional conversation for mentoring certification, an assessor noted: *‘looking at research and case studies \[FLiTE resources\] enabled deep thinking about \[mentor’s\] own actions leading to modified actions*’ \[ **5.6**\]. 

 In addition to the direct impact of FLiTE, White’s two books for practitioners underpinned by her research in **3.1** and **3.2** resulted in an invitation to co\-lead, since 2014, annual *Becoming a Teacher Educator* workshops run by the Teacher Education Advancement Network for university\-based teacher educators in the UK. The most recent workshop in 2019 saw 69 teacher educators participate, with a similar number attending in each of the previous years \[ **5.7**\]. This represents the induction of about 40% of newly appointed university\-based teacher educators each year in the UK \[ **5.7**\]. The FLiTE resources have become an important part of these training workshops. The training lead said: ‘ *We recommend these \[FLiTE resources\] as valuable and relevant resources during the workshops each year and encourage participants to use them in their mentor training’* \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Influencing mentor training policy of Initial Teacher Education providers** 

 At the 2016 Initial Teacher Training Provider Regional Network, facilitated by the National College of Teaching and Leadership, White shared her research findings about needing to recognise SBTEs and support their CPD. Four training providers attended UH to discuss these issues. White then worked with The Pilgrim Partnership, a school\-centred initial teacher training provider, to recognise their mentors’ work through developing existing UH Coach\-Mentor Certification and aligning it with the *National Standards for school\-based initial teacher training mentors*. This certification was further developed to include mentors working with UH through partnership schools. Since 2017, UH has awarded certification to 89 mentors \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **Facilitating collaborations with practitioner associations overseas to effect policy and practice change** 

 Through the research collaboration with Timmermans, the FLiTE resources were developed into a book and published in Dutch on *Platform Samen Opleiden en Professionaliseren*, a Dutch Government\-funded support tool for teacher educators across the Netherlands. Between its launch in October 2020 and December 31, 2020, the book of resources was downloaded more than 700 times, making it the most popular download on the website \[ **5.9**\]. A copy of the book was distributed to all 106 school\-university partnerships in the Netherlands and used in an online conference attended by 25 teacher educators \[ **5.9**\]. Feedback demonstrated that the book is used by both school and university\-based teacher educators during CPD activities and is well received ‘ *because of the practical usefulness*’ \[ **5.9**\]. 

 The research led to invitations for White to contribute to annual meetings \(Brussels, 2016; Edinburgh 2017\) of the International Forum for Teacher Educator Development \(InFo\-TED\) and participate in the establishment of an international network to support teacher educators’ professional learning \[ **5.10**, p1 and pp3\-5\]. InFo\-TED is a partnership of eight university teacher education institutions in Europe that promotes the professional learning and development of teacher educators. White, recognised by InFo\-TED as a key person in research on professional development of teacher educators, contributed to the increased discourse and culture change in this field, which drove changes in policy and strategy. Thus, InFo\-TED’s White Paper, *The Importance of Teacher Educators: Professional development imperatives* \(2019\), called for more formal support systems for teacher educators’ learning and dedicated financial support for SBTE CPD programmes \[ **5.10**, p12\], and the DfE’s *Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy* \(2019\) included a breakthrough commitment to ‘ *fully funded mentor training*’ \[ **5.10**, p40\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research into customer\-to\-customer interaction \(CCI\) has led to development of customer service strategy at The Hive \(a large library and council services hub\) and other libraries in the region. The research enabled a better managerial understanding of the complexity of the interactions taking place between customers in libraries, and an enhanced managerial appreciation of the potential for employees to contribute to the effective management of such interactions. The wider impacts of the research are social and cultural, by enabling a diversity of users \(e.g. different age, social class, ethnic background, purpose of visit\) to use public facilities simultaneously in a more harmonious and supportive environment. The impact of the research also extends to improving the wellbeing of employees faced with difficult CCI situations. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Traditionally, research in the area of customer\-to\-customer interaction \(CCI\) has focused on the customer’s perception of CCI. Nicholls’ research has been influential in shifting attention from the customer’s experience of CCI to the management of CCI. Nicholls’ research has focused on the frontline employee perspective on CCI. 

 The research that this case study is based on focused on enabling libraries and other community hubs to solve some of the issues they face with a diverse customer base simultaneously consuming a range of services, in a variety of consumption styles, in a shared physical service setting \(Reference 1 & 2\). These issues include: 

-  How a user copes with the physical presence of other users \(e.g. the sound and visual impacts of others\) 

-  How users share resources in a mutually acceptable way 

-  How a user copes with their perceptions of those different to themselves 

-  How users view the appropriateness of the activities that other users are engaged in 

 The need for effective and innovative ways to manage the interactions between fellow users of libraries and other community hubs is clear \(Reference 2\). There is a requirement to operate in an inclusive way that maximises the physical, mental and social comfort of users, and does not deter some groups from using the facilities. This gives rise to the concept of managing CCI, a key aspect of which is using frontline employees to detect, prevent and deal with negative CCI \(NCCI\) and to foster and endorse positive CCI \(PCCI\). The objectives of the main underpinning research were to gain insights into how frontline employees perceive and experience CCI, and to explore how they handle CCI. Details of the two studies follow: 

-  **Diversity and customer\-to\-customer interaction**: This research \(Reference1\) explored the concept of CCI in terms of customer diversity. It revealed that the prevailing perspective that customer diversity was problematic for CCI was an oversimplification and that diversity could in some circumstances be favourable for CCI. The study focused upon the consequences for CCI of customers being from different age groups. 

-  **Managing customer\-to\-customer Interaction**: This research \(Reference 2\) focused on exploring the capacity of frontline employees to provide insights into CCI and its management. The study found that frontline employees: \(i\) are able to recall CCI encounters with ease; \(ii\) are capable of conceptualising and exploring complex nuances surrounding CCI encounters; \(iii\) can distinguish levels of seriousness of negative CCI and variations in customer sensitivity to CCI; \(iv\) vary in their comfort in intervening in negative CCI situations.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The primary impact of the research has been on  [The Hive](http://www.thehiveworcester.org/) in Worcester, a University and Public Library, although it has also extended to other Library Services in the region. The Hive, developed in collaboration between the University of Worcester and Worcestershire County Council, was the first joint university and community library in Europe when it opened in 2012. The Hive also functions as a community hub, contains a significant exhibition space and houses a Business Centre. 150 staff \(both University and County Council\) work in the Hive. It attracts over 700,000 visitors per year \(making it the 8<sup>th</sup> most visited library in the UK in 2019\). Its event’s and exhibition’s programme is targeted across all age ranges from young children to older generations, so its visitor profile at any one time is very diverse. 

 The senior management team at the Hive approached Nicholls in 2015 to undertake a study of employee perspective on customer\-to\-customer interaction in the library. Management wished to address an ongoing issue with customer behaviour and the impact that was having on both staff and other customers. A report on the findings made an initial set of recommendations to amend the customer service strategy and to develop new approaches to training \(Source A\). Further discussion led to a significant re\-orientation of the Hive’s customer service strategy \(Source B\). This had three main elements: 

-  *Recruitment:* The research identified the importance of staff being able to deal effectively with CCI situations, including tense and complex triadic situations. This led to modification of employee recruitment processes. The recruitment process now includes an interactive activity that requires applicants to engage with a user of the Hive. Greater emphasis is also placed on recruiting people who have resilience, with explicit interview questions that probe for evidence of resilience. 

-  *Incident management:* The research demonstrated that a significant proportion of incidents in the Hive were a product of CCI. This led to the development of a new approach to how staff managed behaviours \(Sources C and D\). This included improvements to the way in which incidents were logged so that characteristics of incidents could be noted and used to help determine training priorities \(Source A\). 

-  *Training:*  The Hive has redesigned and rebranded its customer service training \(Sources D and E\). The new training approach has a strong focus on preventing negative CCI. It was recognised that there was a need for the early detection of situations which might negatively impact other customers. This involves awareness of what is happening and its wider impact on those in the environment. At the heart of the new training are regular training sessions, held several times a year, for all staff where real scenarios form the basis of discussion about how to handle situations. The training is customised with the selection of incidents used being tailored to the trainees from different sections of The Hive \(e.g. library, housing, archives\). Empowering Hive staff to handle CCI enables many potentially negative situations to be de\-escalated before they become serious or for firm interventions to be made rapidly. The training has been attended by all Hive staff who have customer contact. In the region of 50 staff undergo this training at least twice a year. 

 The re\-orientation of the Hive’s customer service strategy has had the following specific benefits: 

1.  Employees have a better understanding of the range of interactions occurring between customers at The Hive \(Source F\) 

1.  Employees have a better understanding of when and how to intervene in negative CCI situations \(Source D\) 

1.  Employees experience less stress when handling difficult CCI situations \(Source F\) 

1.  Customers at The Hive enjoy a better customer experience and encounter a more consistent employee handing of CCI situations \(Sources A and D\) 

 The impact of the research has extended to several other libraries in the region. An event, partly designed to showcase the new approach to managing customer service at The Hive, was held on 23<sup>rd</sup> November 2018 in Worcester \(Source G\). This one\-day workshop, which was organised under the auspices of Mercian Collaboration Staff Development Group, a professional network of SCONUL higher education libraries in the East and West Midlands, addressed the issue of managing challenging and unorthodox behaviour in academic library environments and was attended by around 20 professional participants responsible for delivering training in libraries, including University of Coventry, Warwick University, and Birmingham City University.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Tens of thousands of young people in the UK die each year due to severe bleeding following traumatic injury. To optimise trauma care, Prof. Brohi’s team at Queen Mary developed a damage control resuscitation \(DCR\) strategy and a massive haemorrhage protocol \(MHP, or ‘Code Red’\). DCR was accepted by NHS England in 2014, and the MHP is now an essential criterion for accreditation of all 23 major trauma centres \(MTCs\) in England. After the DCR and MHP strategies were adopted by the NHS in 2014, mortality rates for patients with major bleeding after trauma fell by 29.4% at the Royal London Hospital \(2014–2020\). The team have shown that viscoelastic haemostatic assays \(VHA\) can identify patients for activation of DCR and MHP within five minutes of arrival in the Emergency Department. They have also showed that a single dose of the drug, Tranexamic acid \(TXA\), is effective for the MHP, thus reducing unnecessary exposure to TXA. These findings resulted in a change in national and international clinical guidelines in 2016.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Trauma is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. The increasing burden of trauma is highest in young adults and children, with 90,000 people under 30 dying each year in Europe, and half of these deaths are due to bleeding. The UK mortality rates for trauma patients with massive haemorrhage is almost 50%, with one of the main reasons for this high mortality rate being abnormal blood clotting after injury. 

 Prior to the work of Queen Mary’s Prof. Brohi, loss of clotting function \(coagulopathy\) in severe bleeding was thought to be a late phenomenon caused by the loss or dilution of blood coagulation factors. Brohi retrospectively analysed blood samples from trauma patients brought by the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service to the Royal London Hospital, and identified that 1 in 4 patients already had established coagulopathy on arrival — and that this ‘Acute Traumatic Coagulopathy’ \(ATC\) was associated with a four\-fold increase in mortality \[3.1\]. 

 Brohi’s group has since focused on understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this condition, specifically: 

-  *The emergence of Trauma\-Induced Coagulopathy \(TIC\) due to suboptimal transfusion protocols during resuscitation.* Suboptimal transfusion causes blood coagulation factors to be diluted, and results in clots that are poorly formed and rapidly broken down. Brohi’s team has refined blood transfusion strategies for treating TIC, creating a ‘balanced’ resuscitation regimen — involving transfusion of blood and coagulation products in equal ratios \[3.2\] — that promotes blood clotting and targets early clotting changes post\-injury. The group has also shown that a single dose of tranexamic acid \(TXA; a drug used to reduce bleeding risk\) is effective for this regimen, thus reducing unnecessary exposure to TXA \[3.3\]. 

-  *The utility of near\-patient diagnostics for goal\-directed therapy*. ATC is an issue predominantly relating to clot strength and breakdown, and standard laboratory clotting assays are insensitive to its presence. Brohi’s team has determined a diagnostic threshold for the condition, and was one of the first research groups to show that viscoelastic haemostatic assays \(VHA\) can identify patients with ATC within five minutes of arrival at the Emergency Department \[3.4, 3.5\].

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Queen Mary’s damage control resuscitation \(DCR\) strategy and massive haemorrhage protocol \(MHP\) have been adopted or recommended both nationally and internationally. As a result, Queen Mary’s trauma team has: 

#  Drastically reduced mortality 

 As a result of Queen Mary’s MHP and DCR strategies, mortality rates from bleeding reduced by 29.4% between 2014 and 2020 at Europe’s biggest trauma centre, the Royal London Hospital. The average number of red blood cell transfusions required by each patient in the first 24 hours also dropped from 12 \(2008\) to just 4 \(2020\), and the number of patients requiring a massive transfusion \(10 or more units, essentially replacing their entire blood volume\) dropped by over half \(from 68% to 17% from 2008–2020, and so a fourfold reduction from 2008\). 

#  Driven a change in clinical management and cost savings in the NHS 

 DCR was adopted by the NHS Commissioning Board \(now NHS England\) in April 2014, and became the primary resuscitation and clinical management strategy for patients suffering from major traumatic bleeding. MHP, or ‘Code Red’, has been adopted as an essential criterion for the accreditation of all 23 major trauma centres \(MTCs\) in England \[5.1\], with Prof. Brohi acting as a steering group member of the Clinical Advisory Group. Approximately 8,600 severely injured patients per year are admitted to MTCs in the UK, of which \~10% activate the local MHP. 

 The introduction of ‘Code Red’ is estimated to save the NHS GBP6,600,000 a year, with wider social cost savings estimated over a five year period being GBP3,600,000,000 in 2010 prices \[5.2\]. Furthermore, the Department of Health and Social Care submitted the team’s work to Treasury as one of only two examples of NIHR\-funded work \[EQR.1\] having impactful research with regards to spending \[5.2\]. 

#  Influenced national and international clinical guidelines 

 Both DCR and MHP are now used internationally \[5.3, 5.4\]. Based on Brohi’s work on DCR and MHP, and findings that a single dose of TXA is effective for their regimen, the 2016 guidelines from the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) for Major Trauma \[5.5\] recommend that all 11 ambulance trusts, 23 MTCs and 105 trauma units in England should have: a specific MHP for adults and children; a fixed\-ratio protocol for blood components \(blood and plasma\); and early use of TXA. This coagulation\-centric approach has also been incorporated into: 

-  UK national transfusion guidelines for all major bleeding \[5.6\] 

-  European guidelines on the management of trauma haemorrhage \[5.4\] 

-  The global Advanced Trauma Life Support Manual \(ATLS\), which was updated in June 2018 \(10<sup>th</sup> ed.\) to include TIC\-targeted therapy in its protocols \[5.7\] 

-  The international Viscoelastic Testing in Trauma Consensus Panel, of which Brohi and Dr. Davenport were members \[5.8\], and guidelines from the British Society for Haematology \[5.9\]. 

#  Improved public awareness and understanding of trauma science 

 Queen Mary’s work on TIC has been featured in national television programmes and is part of the Barts Charity ‘Transform Trauma Appeal’, which has been the subject of seven feature articles in the Sunday Mirror \(readership approximately 1,600,000\). In December 2017, the first Transform Trauma Appeal video had 4,200,000 views; Brohi’s 2017 appearance on ITV’s This Morning had around 2,000,000 live viewers; and the online video has been watched more than 34,000 times \[5.10\]. 

 The team has showcased its work to the public \[5.11\] at: 

-  The British Science Festival \(2014\): 50\-80,000 attendees each year 

-  International Clinical Trials Day \(2014 and 2019\) 

-  A sold\-out ‘Pint of Science’ talk by Brohi \(May 2017, ‘Bloody hell\! *’*\): Pint of Science festival events reached roughly 120,000 attendees in Europe in 2018, 24,000 of which were in the UK\) 

-  Big Bang Fair South East \(2014, 2015 and 2018\): approximately 9,000 children and teachers 

-  Big Bang Eastbourne \(2018\):  approximately 100 children and teachers 

-  Big Bang Newham \(2018\):  approximately 2,500 attendees 

-  Queen Mary’s Festival of Communities \(2018 and 2019\):  approximately 3,000 local residents 

 When surveyed, 100% of the visitors to these events agreed that they had “learnt something new about trauma today,” with many demonstrating a change in their perception of what trauma is: over 90% of children initially referred to psychological trauma, after which the team was able to introduce the notion of trauma as bodily injury. 

 Children gained a good understanding of why blood samples are taken from trauma patients — 100% learnt that blood samples are studied to understand Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome \(MODS\), and also understood the differing roles of a\) the immune system and b\) the cells making a blood clot. When asked to identify the “coolest thing \[they had\] learnt about trauma \[at the event\]” \(Figure 1\), children showed knowledge of information that is not taught to their age group in the school syllabus, reflecting the central role of Queen Mary’s engagement work in increasing children’s awareness and understanding of trauma. This work is reinforced by the team’s educational programme TSCIPP, which produced the educational resource on trauma *Billy and His Blood Cells* \[5.12\]. Brohi’s team distributed the document to medical professionals across the Emergency Department at the Royal London Hospital, who in turn use it to educate children about trauma.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at Edinburgh Napier University has addressed the requirement for human trust in the capture, storage, use and sharing of sensitive data, notably that collected and used in health care. The patented work has been used in a wide range of applications, such as providing governance of the information sharing within health care and finance, and provides a scientific base for a highly successful spin\-out \(Symphonic Software\), recently acquired for USD31million \(11\-2020\). Our research has led to the development of secure, robust and scalable information infrastructures which benefit both individuals and society in areas such as the health and finance sectors.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Weaknesses in information sharing within the UK’s public sector have led to many issues, such as those identified within the Victoria Climbié case where police forces failed to share important information which might have saved Victoria’s life. Along with this, there are well\-known weaknesses within health care around the lack of data integration of the citizen within their health and social care practices. 

 Over the past decade, Professor Bill Buchanan, Alistair Lawson and Professor Christoph Thuemmler \(a clinical practitioner\) led a team of researchers focused on developing new secure infrastructures addressing these issues, developing novel data governance models which support information sharing and integrate the rights of the citizen. The research addressed gaps around data governance related to ownership rights, governance, and privacy through the creation of a framework that set out new processes relating to citizen\-defined access policies. 

 The research began with a collaboration with Police Scotland, looking at weaknesses around information sharing within law enforcement **\[P1\].** Through this project, the team developed a way of solving the complex problem of the large\-scale integration of rights across interconnected domains, where a domain is defined as the entity which stores citizen data \(for example, storing health data within the NHS, or social care data within Council\-owned systems\). The team created a method of using Binary Decision Diagrams \(BDDs\) **\[O1\]** to model complex policies, which enables novel approaches to integration of risk models **\[O3\]** and the abstraction of legal requirements using a novel data obfuscation method **\[O4\].** The team then evaluated this in the context of protecting citizen data within investigations.  The approach enabled complex sharing policies to be structured, and the detection of rule anomalies \(allowing something, and then disallowing it at another place\) and rule shadowing \(where rules are contained in a large set or where they can be merged\). 

 This research was patented in US, UK and World patents filed in 2013/14, defining a ground\-breaking method of modelling information sharing between organizations and where the permissions for the sharing of information are represented as Boolean functions using Binary Decision Diagrams \(BDDs\) **\[O1\]**. 

 The research, also led by Professor Buchanan \(funded within two EPSRC/Innovate UK funded projects: DACAR **\[P3\]** and Trust **\[P2\]**\) was then further developed by introducing the concept of data\-buckets owned by the citizen **\[O2\].** The team evaluated this in health and social care domains **\[P3\]** in a collaboration with clinical researchers in Imperial College, and clinical staff at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Trust **\[P2\]** focused on improved health care within the home environment, with a special focus on the risks for elderly citizens. The new platform ensured that the citizen had complete ownership and governance of their own health care data. As well as the health and social care evaluation **\[O2\]** the researchers evaluated this in the context of integration with home environments **\[O6\]**, focusing on citizen rights within information sharing. 

 The team have extended research into the secure and robust storage of data within Cloud\-based systems, using secret encrypted shares to distribute data across multiple Cloud systems **\[O5\] \[P11\]**. This method considerably enhances both the security and resilience of the storage of health care records. It led to new research projects related to trust architectures within health care **\[P4\]\[P5\]** and the detection of frailty in a home environment **\[P6\]\[P10\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The work has led to a highly successful spin\-out, Symphonic Software, which was acquired by Ping Identity in 2020 for USD31million \(11\-2020\). The software infrastructure sold by Symphonic Software has been used within the information sharing of personal identifiable information \(PII\) in health\-care related applications, including health\-care sharing across EU borders, and has had many commercial applications, including the finance sector. Successful collaborations have taken place with a range of companies on citizen\-focused privacy\-related work, resulting in a patent that will be used in the US education sector.  The impacts are summarized in the following sections: 

 **A. Integrating the citizen and their rights** 

 Proof\-of\-Concept funding from Scottish Enterprise **\[P9\]** allowed the underlying research on proving a large scale information sharing architecture in health care to be developed into the sa.FIRE \(Secure Analysis and Filtering Risk Engine\) information architecture engine. This attracted further investment and in 2013, a company was spun\-out: Symphonic Software **\[C2\]**.  By Dec 2020, Symphonic Software had 35 full\-time employees and has been through several rounds of investment **\[C3\]**. It has developed markets around the world, and has been involved in large\-scale integration projects, including health and social care information sharing within the NHS National Services Scotland and Scottish Ambulance Service **\[C2\]**. The developed engine has now been applied to different application areas, including in the finance sector, and in information sharing across the public sector. Symphonic Software’s customer list includes: Ping Identity, NHS National Services Scotland, Tesco Bank, the Scottish Government, Janrain \(part of Akamai\), and OneLondon **\[C2\]**. 

 Symphonic was acquired by Ping Identity in November 2020 for USD31million \(11\-2020\). The CEO and Founder of Ping Identity says: “ *The acquisition of Symphonic accelerates our vision for enterprises to not only maintain security and compliance with confidence, but to easily deliver personalized, trustworthy experiences*” **\[C7\]**.  For the last four years, Ping Identity has been defined as a leader in Gartner’s 2020 Magic Quadrant for Access Management. 

 The CEO of Symphonic says: “ *I would like to thank the University for providing us with the opportunity to scale the research work from the DACAR project and other related research into the creation of Symphonic.  From the core ideas and working within Symphonic, we have developed the fundamental research into a number of sectors and industries, including Health, represented by EU Horizon 2020 work, the NHS in Scotland and in some of the US's largest health\-related organisations. The fundamental ideas that originated in Napier's research work have provided a core focus around the citizen and their rights, and we have appreciated the opportunity to scale the core research principles into a range of application areas”*. **\[C10\]** 

 The information sharing infrastructure developed in the research **\[O2\]** is also being used in the EU\-funded SHiELD \(European Security in Health Data Exchange\) programme of which Symphonic Software is a partner. This aims to share citizen health care data across borders **\[C5\].** Symphonic thus successfully applied information sharing to a range of health and social care applications. The Director/CIO of OneLondon, North London Partners in health and care, says: "" *Symphonic provided us with the services and support to deliver the outcomes needed for the OneLondon information governance programme. The solution is used across the whole of London to protect access to patient data, streamline data governance and improve patient care*"" **\[C2\].** The Head of Finance Crime at Tesco Bank says: “ *Through a collaborative approach, Symphonic provided a sophisticated orchestration layer and policy decision platform enabling Tesco Bank to meet demanding regulatory requirements”* **\[C2\]**. CEO at RAIDIAM – a UK\-based identity company \- explains: "" *Symphonic brings a real step change to digital policy decision making. Their solution makes solving complex business use cases at an internet scale easier to deliver and easier to manage”* **\[C2\].** 

 **B. Citizen\-focused data privacy** 

 Our work around data privacy has led to successful collaborations. A collaboration with HAS Technology focused on new infrastructure for health and social care, leading to wearable technologies to predict the risk of people falling. This won “Innovation of the Year” at the Scottish Knowledge Exchange awards in 2020 **\[C8\]**. 

 The research team has scaled their work into secure storage of citizen data within public clouds, working with Payfont Ltd in the creation of a Cloud\-based architecture which uses data fragments. The developed system is known as ADeCA \(Anonymised Distributed eCloud Architecture\) and is a heterogeneous, keyless, non\-linear, hybrid data architecture that renders data completely fragmented and contextless, making it meaningless to outsiders **\[O5\]**. This won ‘Innovation of the Year’ in 2017 at the inaugural Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards **\[C6\]**. It has resulted in a patent **\[C11\]**, which was acquired by Leading Software Limited in December 2019 and is being applied within an education product within the US. Charlie Morrison, a Director of Leading Software Limited, outlines: “ *We are building on this patent and will provide a solution that could be used globally i.e. in every one of the 61,000 colleges/universities worldwide. It would be a highly secure 'data vault' facility where highly sensitive University/College/High School student transcript files are removed/transferred in from the student records systems and stored separately using ADeCA principles \(as defined in the patent\) in an application that is only viewable or accessible by approved students, admin staff employers and so on, authenticating with multi\-factor tests*” **\[C12\]**. 

 The long\-term drive around trust, governance, consent and privacy resulted in Prof Bill Buchanan receiving an ""Outstanding Contribution Award"" in 2018 at the Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards for sustained work within areas such as health care **\[C9\]**. Along with this, the success of this work has supported the university in the creation of the world's first Blockchain Identity lab **\[C1\]** which has a core focus on the citizen and their rights **\[P7\]\[P8\]**, attracting further funding in 2020 **\[C4\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our research developed innovative and cost\-effective cyber solutions for online safety and has gone on to have substantial impacts on small medium\-sized enterprises \(SMEs\) in the UK and overseas. It provided better protection in people’s homes and businesses against modern advanced online threats. In Nigeria, our free training programme for businesses has enabled over 1,500 SME employees to become more resilient to cyberattacks during the COVID\-19 pandemic. In the UK, our technology\-sharing project SOLVD has brought new software to cybersecurity companies through a partnership programme with Telford & Wrekin Council. Furthermore, our new spin\-out company Onlyn Shield Ltd is bringing cost\-effective pioneering security solutions to the UK market.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The COVID\-19 outbreak has impacted daily lives, with more people accessing their work data from home while looking after their families. This situation has been exploited by cybercriminals to attack people and businesses. The Wolverhampton Cyber Research Institute \(WCRI\), established in 2017, brings together academics from the School of Mathematics and Computer Science and builds on the established strength of its members in the areas of cyber incident response, online safety, artificial intelligence, and cyber\-physical systems. In an ever\-changing online world, the expertise within the group has been utilised to support online safety against substantial risks. Many individuals/organisations do not have the resources to deploy expensive cybersecurity solutions; therefore, our research aims provide free training and cost\-effective software to businesses and people around the world. The following findings \[F\] have been key in that mission: 

 <ins>F1. Forensically\-enabled methods for proactive</ins> <ins>i</ins><ins>ncident</ins> <ins>r</ins><ins>esponse</ins> 

 The Internet is an enabler for cyber\-attacks including the victimisation of vulnerable groups \(e.g. children, disabled people\) which includes radicalisation, bullying, stalking and grooming. However, the Internet can also provide an environment for near\-real\-time detection and mitigation. Novel methods have been designed by our researchers to identify, assess risk and cover the forensic preservation of various types of cyber incidents. A model has been developed to leverage distributed ledger technology and Internet of Medical Things \(IoMT\) data to detect stressful events \[R1\]. For example, when bullying takes place, the model will allow quicker and better decision\-making, while revolutionising aspects related to compliance, double\-entry, confidentiality, and privacy. To provide a proof of validity, the concept of “Digital Witnesses” \(DW\) is introduced to the context of our work where data produced by digital devices becomes fully documented \[R2\] to support incident response methodologies in smart environments \[R3\]. DW helps to make sure that event reconstruction is viable, and data integrity \-and therefore admissibility\- to a Court of Law can be achieved with A Chain\-of\-Custody \(CoC\) maintained in near real\-time \[R2\]. 

 <ins>F2. Assessing information gleaned from web browsers to preserve user privacy</ins> 

 The data collection of online browsing habits of individuals can enable effective advertisement targeting and retargeting. However, these data collection practices can cause leakage of private data belonging to website visitors \(end\-users\) without their knowledge. Furthermore, this data can be utilised to enable cyberstalking. \[R4\] presents a new method \(AdPExT\) to extract third\-party parameter key\-value pairs at an individual key\-value level. This feeds into a process to monitor and analyse what personal data is collected by online servers. Furthermore, a survey gathered the perceived sensitivity sentiment for various representative tracking parameters to help in the risk assessment of visited websites. 

 <ins>F3. Parameter reduction technique for efficient classification with optimal decisions</ins> 

 Statistical classification has many applications including pattern recognition and decision\-making, which is needed to support the digital solutions presented in this case study. However, existing classification techniques that were proposed previously for eliminating data inconsistency could not achieve an efficient parameter reduction in soft set theory, which affects the obtained decisions. Meanwhile, the computational cost made during the combination generation process of soft sets could cause machine infinite state, this is known as nondeterministic polynomial time. An efficient soft set reduction\-based binary particle swarm optimized by biogeography\-based optimizer \(SSR\-BPSO\-BBO\) algorithm was developed \[R5\]. It generates an accurate decision for optimal and sub\-optimal choices. Additionally, a novel COVID\-19 optimizer Algorithm \(CVA\) was developed based on an efficient optimizer algorithm that can solve non\-deterministic polynomial\-time hardness \(NP\-hard\) in addition to applied optimization problems \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research helped SMEs to transform their employees’ understanding of cyber threats and the ability to deploy appropriate security controls and incident response. Additionally, our research aided SMEs to bring innovations to the market. The following impacts \[I\] have been realised: 

 <ins>I1.</ins> <ins>Impacting understanding of</ins> <ins>and response to</ins> <ins>online risk for SMEs in Nigeria</ins> 

 Our research on innovative cyber solutions against online threats \[F1\] and user privacy \[F2\] has informed training of thousands of employees to become more resilient to cyberattacks during the COVID\-19 pandemic *.* The pandemic has raised the issue of cybersecurity in relation to the new normal of expecting staff to work from home. This has increased the possibility of state‐sponsored, phishing and ransomware attacks. 

 Through the Cybersafe Foundation, a Nigerian based Non\-Governmental Organisation \(NGO\) on a mission to facilitate a safer internet for everyone with digital access in Nigeria, employees from over 1,500 SMEs across Nigeria are now better informed about how to protect themselves and the businesses they work for from cyber threats. The project was delivered in partnership with the UK Government through its Foreign and Commonwealth and Development office \(FCDO\) under the initiative *Safe Digital Community During COVID\-19*, and we were the only University to contribute to the programme. Our findings on forensically enabled methods incident response \[F1\] and user privacy \[F2\] were used to create educational materials, including slides, handouts, videos and other reference materials \[C1\], aimed at arming employees with the knowledge and skills required to identify, protect, detect, defend and respond to COVID\-19 instigated cyber threats. In October 2020, the free 8\-week virtual programme was delivered to 3057 participants, across 1504 SMEs, in 35 states across Nigeria, via an eLearning platform and biweekly live conferences \[C1\]. 

 This represents a hugely significant push forwards in the cybersecurity training available to SMEs in a country where such training is almost non\-existent. The UK Government’s Head of Digital Access Programme and Country Adviser indicated: 

 “This project demonstrates the UK Government’s continued support for Nigeria and its digital sector, recognizing the tech ecosystem’s role in inclusive growth and development,” \[C2\]. 

 The Founder of Cybersafe further commented that: 

 “This training raised the bar in cybersecurity preparedness for Small and Medium Scale Businesses in Nigeria who until this time were indeed worst prepared to defend against prevalent cyber\-attacks” \[C1\]. 

 Feedback from the attendees was very positive with comments such as: “The training opened my eyes to cloud data privacy, practical ways to secure web applications, cloud computing, how to secure my passwords, etc”, “as a staff \(member\) of a local trading organisation, joining the training helped me to learn how to protect my organization from cyber\-attacks and how to secure my business for the future”, and , “the lessons learned from this training were helpful in my daily task of ensuring the protection of my clients’ and organisations” 

 In terms of the success of the course in enhancing cyber resilience, the Founder of Cybersafe further clarified that “57% of beneficiaries could not identify a phishing email before training” but following training on incident response”, and that “83% beneficiaries now understand prevalent attack vectors and preventive measures” \[C1\]. Furthermore, “76% of beneficiaries have now implemented one or more security controls” \[C1\]. 

 Overall, the training campaign was transformative and impactful, with SMEs continuing to enrol their employees for the training programme in 2021. This is a prime example of how high quality cyber research can be used to significantly benefit businesses, who would otherwise been financially unable to access such expertise. 

 <ins>I2. Developing skills of UK based SMEs</ins> <ins>during the pandemic</ins> 

 The effect of the COVID\-19 crisis on SME performance across the UK is immense. In the year prior to the pandemic, 80% of SMEs reported stable or growing revenue. However, after the pandemic begun, 80% of SMEs say their revenues are declining. Research on forensically enabled incident response \[F1\], user privacy \[F2\] and efficient classification \[F3\] helped to establish SOLVD, a new initiative formed between the University of Wolverhampton and Telford & Wrekin Council to improve knowledge and skills for the digital economy in the region. Through free workshops, seminars and 1\-to\-1 sessions, up until December 2020, SOLVD has helped 2 businesses to find growth opportunities at this challenging time by learning about emerging digital technologies. The Co\-founder of Lockdown Cyber Security Ltd commented 

 “The SOLVD workshop provided us with new technology to use within our business, which adapted our business plan and brought it to life, maintaining our business agility and creating the roadmap to assist in the creation of our software prototype”, “This experience has shown the value the University can bring, to start\-up businesses, throughout its business journey.” \[C4\]. 

 <ins>I</ins><ins>3</ins><ins>. Bringing</ins> <ins>innovations to market</ins> 

 The findings on cyber\-attacks \[F1\] and online browsing \[F2\] were used to create new software and form a new SME, the spin\-out company Onlyn Shield Ltd \(Company number: 112462631\), registered in 2020. The product is an intelligent safeguarding software platform to protect children from harmful online communications at schools and households. With the increase in online activity due to the COVID\-19 pandemic, and recent studies showing 1 in 4 children have been exposed to racism or hate messages online, the need for such innovative software has never been more prevalent. Onlyn Shield offers quicker intervention and better filtering capabilities than previous alternatives, with the ability to address emerging threats targeting children on social media. The project also aims at achieving Incident Response and safer Internet surfing without having to block popular services and websites. 

 The Market Validation Report \[C5\] for Onlyn Shield Ltd was compiled as part of the CyberASAP programme, and included data collected from a conference attended more than 30 teachers, with 7 interviews with headteachers and 18 interviews with parents. Given a relatively low product annual license fee of GBP35 per family or GBP7 per pupil, the overall annual UK Market Potential was estimated at approximately GBP266,000,000, with sales potential for Onlyn Shield of GBP5,320,000 aiming for 2% market penetration, with potential growth to GBP18,620,000 \(7% market penetration\), and further potential global growth beyond the UK market. This indicates a huge potential market for Onlyn Shield making it a significantly viable product, both in terms of potential revenues, but also in terms of the potential benefits to families who will have access to a cheap and effective tool for keeping their children safer online. 

 Overall, in a world where online risks have never been more prevalent, our research is being used to good effect to provide solutions to businesses and people who otherwise may not have the financial means to protect themselves.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at Strathclyde led to the development and commercialisation of a pioneering lighting system that can kill bacteria, fungi, and, under certain circumstances, viruses on surfaces and in the air. ‘Whole\-room’ environmental decontamination is achieved with high\-intensity narrow\-spectrum violet\-blue light, which is safe for patients and staff, material and equipment, and can be continuously operated without the need for trained staff, or time consuming and potentially hazardous manual cleaning protocols. Licensees of the technology include two major US manufacturers, with implementation in over 300 healthcare facilities to date, with benefits to patient health, cost savings for hospitals, and economic benefits to commercial suppliers. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Hospital\-acquired infections are a worldwide problem, and the increasing emergence of multi\-drug resistant microbes presents both a major risk to public health and a significant economic burden on the global healthcare system. Environmental contamination is a significant source of infection transmission, with potential sources of cross\-infection being contact from contaminated surfaces, the hands of medical staff or equipment, and through the air. In the fight against healthcare infection, Strathclyde researchers developed an antimicrobial high\-intensity narrow\-spectrum \(HINS\) violet\-blue \(indigo\) light system, through highly interdisciplinary research at The Robertson Trust Laboratory for Electronic Sterilisation Technologies \(ROLEST\) involving engineers, microbiologists, optical physicists and statisticians, in collaboration with clinicians from Glasgow Royal Infirmary and at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge. 

 Initial work involved fundamental investigation of the microbial sensitivity to narrow bandwidths of near\-UV and visible light, using broad\-spectrum light sources and a series of optical filters, identified a peak of antimicrobial activity in the region of 405nm. Further investigation led to development of 405nm narrow\-band light emitting diode \(LED\) array systems as suitable sources for improved optical and energy efficiency. Irradiance and dose experiments using 405nm sources established broad antimicrobial efficacy against bacteria, endospores, fungi and, under certain conditions, viruses \[ **R1**\]. The team conducted a detailed safety analysis of these antimicrobial wavelengths against international standards \(International Committee on Non\-Ionising Radiation Protection \(ICNIRP\) and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists \(ACGIH\)\). This established the safety of these wavelengths, and enabled identification of optical irradiance levels, which could be utilised for safe, continuous exposure of humans \[ **R2**\] – a major safety advantage over UV light. The advantage of being able to utilise 405nm violet\-blue light in the presence of humans led to the concept of developing an antimicrobial technology which could provide safe, continuous environmental decontamination, in occupied environments, as a novel infection control strategy \[ **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\]. 

 A Scottish Enterprise Proof of Concept Award to the ROLEST research team at Strathclyde led to the technical development of a 405nm High\-Intensity Narrow\-Spectrum Light Environmental Decontamination System \(HINS\-light EDS\). The objective of this project was to advance from the use of single small\-scale light sources to the development of a large\-scale, ceiling\-mounted, blended white light system which had appropriate optical output to provide continuous decontamination efficacy over large ‘whole room’ areas, whilst being within the acceptable human safety limits. Significant technological challenges were involved in this, including: identification of appropriate light sources for antimicrobial effectiveness; integration of optical components for a blended white\-light output; irradiance profiling to ensure optimal optical output; thermal management of the optical components; power and energy efficiency requirements to ensure the system was in line with standard lighting systems; and antimicrobial testing against a range of microbes to ensure decontamination efficacy \[ **R3**, **R4**, **R5**\]. The decontamination source also required optical blending in order to produce a lighting system which had an overall ‘white’ optical output similar to standard room lighting, in order to ensure usability and acceptability of the final prototype \[ **R2**\]. A range of custom\-build prototype and demonstration units for laboratory, clinical and industrial use have been designed and developed, with specifications fit for end user applications. Overall, there is a significant body of underpinning research conducted at Strathclyde into this antimicrobial technology covering aspects including: energy efficiency, germicidal efficacy and synergy, microbial resistance, material degradation, pulsed efficacy and safety \[ **R2**, **R5**, **R6**\].

###  Notes on the quality of research: All references journal articles and conference papers were peer\-reviewed ahead of publication. The underpinning research to develop the prototype was supported by a Scottish Enterprise Proof of Concept Award \(MacGregor & Anderson. POC7 HINS\-light system for the control of MRSA. Scottish Enterprise, 02/10/2006 – 31/05/2009, GBP457,000\) and was awarded Research Project of the Year 2011 by Times Higher Education. The research has been patented and has led to four licensing agreements. 
","
##  4. Details of the impact 

 Clinical evaluation of the HINS\-light system provided validation of the decontamination efficacy of the technology and external recognition of the research, with isolation rooms found to be cleaner \(up to 90% less environmental contamination\) when the system was used in conjunction with standard cleaning and infection control procedures \[ **R3**\]. The IP for the technology is protected by two families of patents \(Process and Device patents e.g. \[ **R2**\]\) with patents granted in the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, China, Australia and Japan. Through licensing this technology, the Strathclyde research has: 

-  Enabled commercialisation of the HINS\-light technology, leading to the growth of two major US manufacturers, 

-  Established a safer and more effective decontamination method; 

-  Supported decontamination in hospitals, resulting in improved cleanliness and infection control; 

-  Reduced surgical\-site infections and improved patient health, resulting in cost savings through improved patient treatment and mitigation against hospital penalties. 

###  Enabling commercialisation of HINS\-light technology 

 Underpinning research led to IP generation \[ **R2**\], and the subsequent licensing of the technology to two major US lighting manufacturers: Kenall Lighting in June 2015 \[ **S1**, **S2**\], and Hubbell Lighting Corporation in April 2018 \[ **S3**\]. These licensing agreements have generated a royalty income to the University of Strathclyde of nearly GBP1,000,000 from 2015 to date. Kenall Lighting, who are licensees for the healthcare field, have developed and commercialised the technology under the brand name *Indigo\-Clean.* The establishment of this dedicated branch within Kenall Lighting has resulted in a significant increase in income \[Text removed for publication\] and the creation of 5 jobs directly related to Sales & Marketing of the products \[ **S2**\]. In addition, the technology ‘has had a key impact on the company’s future as it was a large factor in its recent acquisition by Legrand, a multi\-billion dollar French company specializing in the building environment’ \[ **S2**\]. \[Text removed for publication\] Hubbell Lighting Corporation are licensees of the technology for applications outwith the healthcare industry, and have commercialised the technology under the brand name *SpectraClean.* \[Text removed for publication\] Their products have won a number of awards including a 2019 US Vision Award which ‘honor innovation and excellence in products that contribute to the efficient and profitable operations and management of institutional and commercial buildings in the United States *’* \[ **S4**\]. Recent licensing developments have been sub\-licensing of the patents by Kenall to Pinnacle Lighting \(May 2020\) \[ **S5**\], and a first European license to Linea Light of Italy \(November 2020\). Announcing the sub\-licence, the President of Kenall stated: ‘Kenall is moving into our next phase of championing disinfection using safe wavelengths of visible light. Sublicensing Strathclyde’s core patent using the Indigo\-Clean brand will further expand the use of this unique, life\-saving technology’ \[ **S5**\]. 

###  Establishing a safer and more effective decontamination method 

 Cleaning and disinfection play a major role in reducing hospital\-acquired infection, but are dependent upon staff competence and compliance with protocols. In this context, the clinical research partner and previous Head of Microbiological Services for NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde highlights: ‘It is well known that these may be compromised, particularly in busy institutions with high bed occupancy rates, or where there are shortages of appropriately trained staff’ \[ **S6**\]. The key advantage of this technology is that it can be operated without the need for trained staff, as it is a simple light switch, and is safe for continuous operation in occupied environments: 

 ‘Some of the more potent chemical disinfectants e.g. formaldehyde gas or vapour have been used in recent years for terminal disinfection of ward areas affected by outbreaks of multi\-resistant or hypervirulent strains of “superbugs”, as has UV irradiation. However, because of their hazardous and toxic effects, they cannot be used while patients and staff are present, hence are unsuitable for routine environmental decontamination. Against this background, the discovery by these researchers that High Intensity Narrow Spectrum 405nm light \(HINS\-light\) had broad\-spectrum antimicrobial activity, even at levels of irradiance that do not pose a hazard to humans, was a major breakthrough.’ \[ **S6**\] 

 In addition to the Strathclyde research demonstrating the efficacy of the technology against a wide range of superbugs, including MRSA and C. difficile \[ **R3**, **R4**\], a range of independent studies has validated the benefits of the technology. At IDWeek Conference 2016 \(USA\), data was presented to show the efficacy of the system against a range of microbial pathogens on surfaces, with successful inactivation of three key problematic bacteria \(MRSA, VRE, MDRA\) on surfaces \(>80% reduction in 24\-hr\) \[ **S7**\]. At the same conference, other clinicians presented on the effective use of the technology within an intensive care unit for environmental decontamination and confirmed its efficacy as a complementary strategy in the fight against hospital environmental contamination, with the levels of environmental staphylococcal contamination reduced by 99.4% after 2 weeks use \[ **S7**\]. In 2016, another independent UK study highlighted clinical use of the technology in an NHS specialist burns unit as part of an infection\-control bundle to help control environmental contamination from multi\-drug resistant bacteria, and prevent transmission to other patients \[ **S7**\]. 

###  Supporting decontamination in hospitals, with improved cleanliness and infection control 

 Kenall Lighting’s *Indigo\-Clean* technology has been adopted in more than 300 US healthcare facilities in just 5 years since commercial launch, which ‘highlights how strongly the value of the technology resonates with healthcare providers’ \[ **S2**\]. The CEO and Managing Director of Henderson Hospital, stated: ‘We currently have Indigo\-Clean disinfectant lights in all of our inpatient and outpatient surgical suites and emergency department patient bays….Indigo\-Clean has been a great partner in our fight to maintain a safe, clean environment for our patients. There are many disinfectant technologies available, but we feel Indigo\-Clean is the right tool to help keep our patients safe’ \[ **S1**\]. Medical Director, New Century Spine and Outpatient Surgical Institute, noted the benefits for them: ‘We chose to invest in Indigo\-Clean for our operating room lighting not only because of the proven high antimicrobic rates, but we appreciated the ease of use, and the ability to continuously disinfect our operating rooms without any downtime. That translates into more procedures and more revenue for us.’ \[ **S1**\]. In 2019, Kenall Lighting announced a partnership with SLD Technology, Inc. to incorporate the technology into a fully\-integrated, modular ceiling system that combines the HINS\-light disinfection with ventilation, electrical, filtration, ambient light, that is easily installed into operating rooms \[ **S1**\]. Kenall Lighting ‘have a vision for this technology in which it becomes the “standard” light fixture within healthcare institutions worldwide’, and due to the current pandemic ‘the opportunities for HINS technology have grown dramatically *’* \[ **S2**\]. In April 2020, in response to the urgent need for lighting in temporary hospitals during the pandemic, Kenall introduced portable Indigo\-Clean fixtures which ‘provide generous ambient light while safely and continuously killing harmful bacteria, bolstering existing cleaning and infection prevention protocols, and reducing harmful bacteria when used as recommended’ \[ **S8**\]. 

###  Reducing surgical\-site infections and improved patient health, resulting in additional cost savings in penalties and expenses for hospitals 

 Annually, in the USA, approximately 2,000,000 patients suffer from a healthcare\-associated infection, and an estimated 90,000 of these patients die. Data published in 2019 demonstrates that use of the *Indigo\-Clean* environmental decontamination lighting system during surgical procedures resulted in a 73% reduction in surgical\-site infections \[ **S9**\] **.** This publication by US clinicians is major independent validation of the technologies ability to not only reduce environmental contamination, but to significantly reduce surgical site infections during its use. ‘The significance of this…finding should not be underestimated, as there are exceedingly few decontamination/disinfection technologies that have been able to demonstrate clinically\-proven reduction in rates of infection as opposed to mere efficacy of decontamination *.’* \[ **S6**\]. Looking specifically at how this impacted the hospital in which the study was conducted, there was ‘a reduction of 14 infections in just one year within only 2 rooms saving the hospital approximately 300,000 USD in penalties and excess costs’ \[ **S2**\]. The technology was also part of a clinical study at the NHS St Andrew’s Centre for Plastic Surgery and Burns, Chelmsford, UK, where it was used as part of a successful infection control bundle for control of multi\-drug resistant infections \[ **S7**\]. Since the study, the systems have been retained and ‘they have continued to provide infection control support for our patients’ \[ **S10**\]. Based on the reductions in infection rate achieved by use of the installed lighting system, and the published costs associated with SSIs, Indigo\-Clean estimates that use of the antimicrobial lighting systems will result in each hospital facility saving USD197,400 \(11\-2020\) per operating room per year \[ **S1**\]. 

 This technology is also supporting health beyond hospitals. Kenall’s Indigo\-Clean products have application in the wider healthcare field, and have been used in nurse’s facilities in schools and therapy/rehab centres and in athletic training facilities: ‘We chose to install the Indigo\-Clean Technology in our athletic training room and adjacent areas. These high\-traffic areas are an opportune environment for bacteria to hide.’ Co\-Head Coach, University of Utah, Dumke Gymnastics Center \[ **S1**\]. On a wider scale, Hubbell Lighting’s SpectraClean products have been applied to food manufacturing \[Text removed for publication\] general office environments and health club/athletic venues, where provision of a cleaner environment will provide public health benefits \[ **S3**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A project spanning the UK, Germany and Bosnia & Herzegovina, *Bolero* created partnerships between the Balkans and the UK and led to youth theatres being set up in Bosnia and Kosovo. The project lasted four years and its impact is still being felt in the Balkan region today. 

 **Impacts on Creativity,** **Culture and Society.**  Collaboration with venues and artists across Europe led to an original form of artistic expression, manifested in a touring performance. Research\-led engagement with under\-engaged audiences in post\-conflict areas led to their participation in Youth Theatres and engaged them in the arts. 

 **Impacts on Understanding, Learning and Participation.**  The project and its themes of music and conflict contributed to processes of commemoration, memorialisation and reconciliation in both Sarajevo and Pristina. Methods of learning have been incorporated into subsequent youth theatres and educational curricula in the Balkan region.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 *Bolero* was part of a practice\-as\-research enquiry into the dramaturgy of music and conflict. The research proposed that Ravel’s music was significantly changed due to his experience of World War One. Owing to this context and its subsequent performance histories \(ballet, concert, ice dance etc.\) parallel research enquiries emerged into post\-conflict theatre and commemoration. 

 The research imperative was framed by Ravel’s instruction to conductors to ‘follow the score’ and the work ‘biographises’ the piece of music, *Bolero*. Using verbatim text, devising techniques and archival research, the body of work advances Rebstock and Roesner’s *Composed Theatre* \(2013\) by using music to structure theatre in both form and content, to propose a ‘post\-music theatre’. The project’s dramaturgy followed Barba’s notion of ‘weaving together’ found and fictional texts about Ravel’s music to create a biography of the original composition fused with the performers’ ‘auto\-dramaturgy’ of surviving conflict. 

 *Bolero* argued that Ravel was influenced by his personal experience of conflict and explores how his post\-WWI music performs commemoration of war, whilst at the same time exhibiting traits of the onset of his own dementia, the dissolution of memory, and ‘acts of memoricide’ \(Donia, 2006\). *Bolero* stages Ravel’s score by creating post\-dramatic, post\-music performance and deconstructing post\-conflict narratives around its original composition. The collaborative processes of the research tested the conventional delineation of artistic roles, especially in reconfiguring the relationship between audience and performer and exploring ‘orchestral theatre’ \(Curtin, 2019\). This led to a conceptualisation of the ‘immersive concert’ as frame. 

 The process was iterative and organic and involved archival visits and site\-writing at Museé Maison Ravel and L’Opéra Garnier in Paris, where *Bolero* was premiered in 1928, and the Olympic Museum at Zetra Stadium, Sarajevo, where Torvill and Dean won gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics, as well as research into Ravel’s opus and its musicology. Interdisciplinary methods used to make this work have included verbatim theatre, multiple devising processes, as evidenced in the Digital Theatre \+ *Making Postdramatic Theatre Handbook* \(2018\) \(3.5\), and archival and musicological study of scores, with creative, critical and dramaturgical input from dancers, pianists, conductors, musicians and ice skaters. 

 This particular enquiry is part of an ongoing investigation into practice\-as\-research as a dramaturgical process evidenced through an iterative process of practical exploration, conference papers and published outputs. For the underpinning research, Pinchbeck drew on Klaic’s contribution to *Theatre in Crisis* \(2002\), where he writes about the catalysing role theatre plays in times of conflict. The Bosnian cast of *Bolero* \(2014\), who lived through the war, shared their experiences and this addressed the act of ‘memoricide’ that took place there \(Donia 2006\). Their autobiographical narratives allowed the final piece to explore the materiality of memory, both personal and cultural, and weave together ‘dramaturgies of remembrance’. This was explored in *Staging Loss: Performance as Commemoration* \(2018\) and related writing and talks on the topic.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research acted as a catalyst for young people’s participation in theatre in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Kosovo.  This Balkan youth theatre work linked directly to the themes of *Bolero*, exploring the relationship between music and conflict and the performance of commemoration.  In October 2014, *Bolero* toured Bosnia & Herzegovina \(Sarajevo, Zenica, Mostar, Tuzla\) as part of the British Council’s Connecting Creatively Project which generated economic impact \(Euro 208k\) between May 2014 and March 2015 reached an audience of 740k across TV and radio **\[5.1\]**.  In March 2016, *Bolero* also toured Kosovo \(Pristina, Prizren\) and represented a drive from the British Council to bring a high\-quality British cultural export to areas of low cultural provision affected by the Balkan conflicts **\[5.1 & 5.2\]**.  The project was an opportunity to bring together British, Bosnian and Kosovan partners to use theatre to engage new audiences and local artists, theatres and youth from post\-conflict areas in contemporary performance and showed a wider audience in the UK the history of Sarajevo **\[5.1, 5.2, 5.3 & 5.5\]**.  The overall audience for *Bolero* was 2k across the UK, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, including a performance to ‘a full house’ in Nottingham **\[5.5\]**. *Bolero* was the first educational programme run by a professional theatre in Sarajevo and received national press coverage **\[5.4\]**.  The performance of *Bolero* in Sarajevo featured on Radio 4’s *Today* programme and Nottingham Playhouse’s satellite project – *Mass Bolero* – featuring Torvill and Dean, was shown on BBC’s *The One Show* and has now received over 177k views on YouTube **\[5.3\]**. 

 Following training in Nottingham in 2014 fledgling youth theatres were established in Sarajevo \(SARTR Theatre’s FAKAT Drama\) and Pristina \(TEATRI ODA Theatre’s, ODA for youth\), adopting Nottingham Playhouse’s processes for working with young people, and new methodology, to create a unique offer for people in the Bosnian and Kosovar capitals **\[5.1\]**. An independent evaluation report collated for the British Council highlights how ‘For both theatres \(and to an extent for Nottingham Playhouse\), the *Bolero* project has been a hugely important articulation of their respective desires to incorporate young people more centrally in their plans. Frustrated by a restrictive education system that teaches facts, they see their respective youth theatres as being exemplary projects that restate the role of young people in society, value their ideas, and develop new audiences for a more diverse programme of work’ **\[5.1\].** The project played a significant role in developing the confidence and transferable skills of the participants. In the British Council’s evaluation of the Fakat Drama workshop, over 80% of participants said that the intensive week changed their behaviour with most citing increased confidence, improved focus, and opportunity for friendships outside of school, and they described a change experienced through ‘finding my voice’, ‘being listened to/valued’ and ‘having ideas accepted’ **\[5.1\]**. 50% of participants felt they were now better at listening and they ‘had more respect for others’, and 100% of the sample said that it had changed their view of theatre: before the workshops only 20% went to the theatre, with 80% now saying they would **\[5.1\]**. The Head of Arts for the British Council in the Western Balkans also noted how parents and facilitators recognized the workshops as a mechanism for enhancing self\-confidence, communication skills, creative development, critical thinking, working with differences, and \[they\] witnessed significant progress in these participants’ \[the children’s\] skills.’ **\[5.1\]**. Pinchbeck’s work contributed to the model used in these workshops by devising exercises and educational resources, that continue to influence theatre\-makers, academics and educational policy across Europe. For example, the Director at Teatri ODA Theatre highlighted how the workshops led to changes in educational policy and the curriculum in Kosovo, and the dramaturg at the studiobüjnekoln at the University of Cologne noted how ‘exercises in the handbook have now been built into our teaching provision here at the University of Cologne’. **\[5.2 & 5.6\]**. The project also provided a case study in an international volume on performance and ruins as a model for practitioners seeking to understand how to present events in ruined spaces **\[5.7\]**. The British Council Head of Arts in the West Balkans, also noted how ‘...this project kick\-started a new way of working for theatre organisations and individuals working in the theatre that still has a tangible impact today.’ **\[5.1\]**. The workshops were transformative for the creative teams, workshop leaders, and the young people participating in Sarajevo, Pristina and Nottingham \[ **5.1 & 5.5\]**. For example, one of the young participants in the FAKAT Drama workshops noted how they ‘opened us up to talking about our emotions’, bonding the group and teaching them teamwork, while the experience of performing at the Nottingham Playhouse also ‘opened me up to a number of options for my career and what I will do with my life’, with the participant now \(6 years later\) considering studying drama in the UK **\[5.5\]**. Similarly, another participant from Bosnia felt the experience opened up ‘a completely new universe’ that altered their perception of their own ability, with them going on to become a screenwriter and actor in films such as *Scream for me Sarajevo* \[2017\] **\[5.5\]**. A workshop leader in Sarajevo has also gone on to become a drama teacher and stated that ‘...during the Fakat Drama workshop in the UK, at that moment just one universe opened up for me, which I wasn’t even thinking about...’ **\[5.5\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lymphoma is the fifth most common cancer. More  than 100,000 people are diagnosed annually with lymphomas in the UK and US alone, and many more globally. Research by King's on the application of positron emission tomography \(PET\) to lymphoma diagnosis and management has led to the following impacts: 

-  a new primary test for staging and for assessing patient response in lymphomas using a 5\-point PET\-CT scanning reporting scale developed at King’s, now included in international guidelines ; 

-  patients experiencing fewer side\-effects and improved cure rates for patients with advanced disease globally; 

-  bone marrow biopsy is now an unnecessary test in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma \(HL\) changing practice in the UK, Europe, Australia and US; 

-  substantial change in practice for the treatment of Hodgkin Lymphoma internationally, using an early PET\-CT scan to stratify and guide treatment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Lymphomas are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hodgkin lymphoma \(HL\) is the most common cancer in teenagers and young adults but also affects older patients with 2,000 new diagnoses in the UK annually. Non\-Hodgkin lymphomas mainly affects  patients over 60 with 14,000 patients diagnosed annually in the UK. 

 There are several different treatments that are used, with varying levels of intensity and risk/side effects. Treatment can include different combinations of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.  Some chemotherapy programmes are more intensive and more effective than others but have more side\-effects e.g. those that include the drug bleomycin can cause significant lung damage in some patients.  Radiotherapy may also have long term side\-effects such as heart and lung disease and increased chance of developing second cancers. 

 Until King’s work in this area, doctors have struggled to select the right treatment for each patient.  This is because assessment using Computerised Tomography \(CT\) provides only structural information making it hard to tell whether treatment is working until it is too late and which fails to identify patients with a high risk of relapse and treatment failure. 

 Since 2000, academics at King’s College London pioneered the use of Positron Emission Tomography \(PET\) imaging to solve these issues. PET gives information on tumour metabolic properties \(i.e. tumour activity\). In particular, a reduction in metabolic rate is a very early indicator of therapy working. 

 King’s led this practice\-changing research in two randomised controlled trials **\(1,2\)** which established that an early PET read\-out could guide and improve treatment in HL. The ‘RAPID’ trial, funded by Blood Cancer UK, recruited patients from 2003 to 2010, and involved 602 patients from the UK; the ‘RATHL’ trial, funded by Cancer Research UK, which recruited from 2008 to 2012 involved 1,204 international patients. These trials demonstrated that it was possible to reduce treatment while maintaining a successful treatment outcome after two or three months of a planned 4\-6 months course of treatment, for those patients with a complete metabolic response \(no evidence of the disease\) on PET. We developed a new 5\-point staging scale to assess initial disease, as well as a rapid readout for response to treatment **\(1\-4\).** 

 Additionally, the RATHL trial demonstrated that PET scans were superior to CT scans and bone marrow biopsies to stage and map the extent of disease before treatment **\(3\)**. This meant that patients with Hodgkin lymphoma no longer need biopsies which are invasive and painful if they have a PET scan instead. The research found a high level of agreement between PET experts, indicating that our 5\-point reporting criteria was robust **\(3\)** and this has subsequently become the international standard **\(5,6\).** A recent King’s analysis further refined the use of the scale and helps with stratifying treatment, by suggesting modifications to the point on the scale used by clinicans to define an inadequate response \(based upon disease stage and measured effectiveness of treatment\) **\(7\).** 

 King’s have also shown that PET research\-based end of treatment approaches can be applied to non\-Hodgkin lymphoma. They collaborated on a third international study in non\-Hodgkin lymphoma \(‘GALLIUM’, funded by Hofman la Roche Pharmaceuticals\) involving 533 patients. King’s and colleagues in Europe and Australia showed that PET is superior to CT, in terms of overall patient response to treatment, when using the 5\-point scale in another more indolent lymphoma type, Follicular Lymphoma \(FL\). Our results suggest that PET is a better imaging modality than contrast\-enhanced CT for response assessment after first\-line immunochemotherapy in patients with follicular lymphoma **\(8\).** 

 Taken together, this research means that we can now personalise lymphoma therapy: clinicians can assess assess very rapidly which patients are responding well to therapy, and which are not \(and therefore need to be switched immediately to an intensive regime\). This ultimately means that more lymphoma patients survive, and fewer patients experience long\-term damage from treatment. King’s method has transformed the approach to lymphoma treatment worldwide, as evidenced in various guidelines.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research at King’s on the approach to management of lymphoma using PET scanning has led to the development of new international guidelines and shaped professional practice and treatment around the world. This work has ultimately improved patient diagnosis, management and outcomes nationally and internationally for those diagnosed with lymphomas. 

 **King’s research has changed international guidelines.**  The methods developed in the King’s\-led RATHL and RAPID trials **\(1\-3\)** have contributed to the harmonisation of practices across PET imaging centres worldwide, stratification of patients and management of the disease. Specifically, King's research led to changes to international guidelines for management of lymphoma from the European Society of Medical Oncology \(ESMO\) and the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network **\(A, B\)**; and contributed to European guidelines for performing quality\-assured PET imaging from the European Association of Nuclear Medicine \(EANM\) **\(C\)**. The 5\-point scale developed at King’s **\(5\)** has become the international standard also known as the ‘Deauville criteria’ and has been adopted in multiple countries since 2014. Previously, there was no agreed common method to perform and report PET scans in lymphoma. 

 **King’s research has influenced clinical practice and health services internationally.** The approaches tested in these trials using PET have become the new standards\-of\-care amongst the haematology and oncology community and are widely used in the UK, USA, and parts of Europe and Australia. This is evidenced by professional material **\(H\),** and patient booklets **\(I\).** This is also confirmed by the Head of Department of Haematology at Concord Hospital, the University of Sydney \( **Australia**\) and past Lymphoma Chair of the Australian Lymphoma and Leukaemia Group: *""*The PET guided approaches tested in RATHL and RAPID have shaped the management of patients treated in Australia, which is reflected in guidelines that will be published in Feb 2021 *”* **\(J\).** 

 The continuous influence King’s researchers have had in professional practice can also be evidenced by \(1\) Prof Barrington’s Research Professorship flagship award from the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) in 2017 and \(2\) her four\-year membership of the European Lymphoma Institute’s scientific committee for international clinical workshops on PET and lymphoma \(2010\-2018\) **\(D\).** The Scientific Advisor at Lymphoma Research Foundation \( **USA**\) attested to the clinical significance of her work: *“*Dr. Barrington’s practice changing research now allows physicians to alter treatment in high risk patients resulting in improved outcomes, and reduce the amount of therapy for those at low risk, with a reduction in toxicities *”* **\(E\).** 

 **King’s research has improved outcomes for lymphoma patients.** The adoption of international best\-practice guidelines resulting from King's research has ensured that PET\-CT is now the standard imaging test at diagnosis of HL worldwide **\(A, B\),** allowing patients to avoid painful and invasive bone marrow biopsies, as documented by patient\-advocates in the UK charity Lymphoma Action Booklet **\(F\).** 

 Moreover, the quality assured PET reporting led to improved outcomes for HL patients treated with ABVD chemotherapy with inadequate early response to initial treatment in the RATHL trial. These patients received more intensive treatment following this PET assessment and as a result 67% of them were alive and free of lymphoma 3 years after treatment **\(2,3\).** This is in contrast to previous reports where only 20% of patients with adverse early PET scan findings survived using the then standard\-of\-care. More than 85% of patients in the RAPID and RATHL trials **\(1\-3\)** who received less toxic treatment as a consequence of the quality\-assured PET reporting were alive without lymphoma three years after treatment. 

 The Chair of the **UK** National Cancer Research Institute’s Hodgkin Lymphoma Research Group has said: *“*Professor Barrington has led the core PET laboratory at King’s which has resulted in practice changing research that has directly improved the care for patients with lymphoma. PET adapted therapy is \[now\] routinely practised worldwide for Hodgkin lymphoma and Professor Barrington pioneered this approach by leading the PET component of the RAPID and RATHL international studies. The resulting practice change has limited acute and late toxicities of treatments for patients and improved the cure rate for advanced stage disease *”* **\(G\).** 

 **Research by King’s has informed the work of cancer charities in the UK.** Lymphoma Action is the UK's only charity dedicated to lymphoma and has provided in\-depth, evidence\-based information for over 30 years, helping thousands of people affected by lymphoma. In 2016, their website, which had over 1,000,000 unique website users, reported on the RATHL trial conducted on HL at King’s **\(K\).** In 2018, at their National Patient and Carer conference, they highlighted the benefits of using PET to guide treatment demonstrated in RAPID and RATHL **\(L, p.17\-23\).** 

 Blood Cancer UK, a charity dedicated to beating blood cancer since 1960, reported how findings from the RAPID trial conducted on HL at King’s were changing practice worldwide *“*making Hodgkin lymphoma treatment kinder *”* by offering less intensive treatment to patients with fewer side\-effects which can include secondary cancer and heart disease **\(M\).**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Digital Cultural Heritage \(CH\) research at the University of Brighton \(UoB\) has transformed the practices of organisations and professionals in the global museum sector. Leading a network of over 100 experts across three continents, UoB researchers have created innovative digital technologies and methods that are now deployed by major heritage institutions across the UK, Europe and Brazil. Computational tools for creating tactile and audio\-visual experiences have improved access to CH collections for thousands of users, resulting in enhanced societal wellbeing, a measurable increase in audience engagement, including a six\-fold increase in visitor engagement with exhibits, and the ability to reproduce the ‘real\-world’ for visually impaired users. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2001, UoB researchers have pioneered a new field of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of Computing Science, Cultural Heritage \(CH\), Art and History. Early UoB research focused on overcoming disciplinary fragmentation between researchers and practitioners from multiple contributing disciplines. Cross\-EU projects \[references 3.7, 3.8\] led by UoB created new research and professional practice communities who co\-created unique technologies and innovative research methods with a specific focus on improving deployment into CH organisations \[3.1, 3.2\]. These pan\-EU programmes led to the consolidation of a new field of research in computer graphics for cultural heritage that is now a firmly established and thriving world\-wide community within the Digital Humanities discipline. 

 Between 2004 and 2012 UoB researchers led two major European projects: EPOCH \(an FP6 Network of Excellence\) **,** and 3D\-COFORM \(an FP7 Integrated Project\) \[3.7, 3.8\]. Bringing together over 100 universities, research centres and CH institutions across Europe and Egypt, EPOCH developed a joint agenda to address the digital needs of the CH sector \[3.1\]. Its successor, 3D\-COFORM **,** developed affordable, practical and effective mechanisms for long\-term documentation of tangible cultural heritage and techniques for the digitisation of CH artefacts. UoB research led a breakthrough in access to 3D CH content over the web, leading to the availability of the first 3D CH content through the Europeana web portal in 2011 \( [https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d\-content\-in\-europeana](https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana)\). Between 2011 and 2015, UoB was a partner of the V\-MusT.net FP7 Network of Excellence \[3.9\] and led an EPSRC funded project \[3.10\], which enhanced the capacity of CH organisations to create digital experiences from digitised resources that are educational, enjoyable and sustainable. UoB developed digitisation workflows, web\-based approaches and semantic technologies for facilitating access to previously inaccessible artefacts \[3.3\] in ways that are sustainable in a heritage context \[3.2\]. This research was subsequently deployed \(2016–2017\) in the National History Museum \(NHM\) in Rio de Janeiro to enhance access to collections, where UoB researchers co\-developed web\-based interactive exhibits of ivory artefacts \[3.4\]. 

 UoB researchers developed computer graphics technologies for design and multi\-sensory experiences of CH collections to support richer documentation and interpretation \[3.5, 3.6\]. Through the deployment of digital and fabrication technologies, this research created novel workflows for tactile and audio\-visual experiences \(eg fabricated physical 3\-dimensional puzzles of authentic CH artefacts for visitors to assemble in the archaeology gallery at the Brighton Museum \[3.5\]\). The fragmentation algorithm makes it possible for a museum to create a 3D puzzle by ‘breaking’ a digitised artefact into fragments that are later manufactured using 3D printing, without any damage to the original. UoB researchers co\-led a programme that produced 3D\-printed replicas that enabled blind audiences to experience works of art normally exhibited in glass cabinets and inaccessible to non\-sighted visitors \[3.6\]. Through a partnership with Future Creators \(an organization supporting the creative potential of young people\), the research developed a novel approach for connecting young people with CH in their local area, by giving them access to museum collections. As a result, young people can create personal narratives in the urban landscape accessible via web\-based Augmented Reality \(AR\) technology. Later research focuses on addressing pressing needs, including preserving heritage at risk, the decolonisation of UK collections acquired from communities across the world and digital inclusivity among international communities, including in Mexico, Brazil and Egypt. This recent work, through an ongoing partnership with FGV in Brazil, involves developing visualisation technologies for digital collections.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 UoB researchers work with CH organisations, professionals, community/civic groups and cultural\-education partnerships to transform how art and heritage collections, with their often fragile and carefully protected artefacts, are documented, accessed and experienced. To provide technological solutions with broad practical applications the research design is co\-developed to respond to the shifting agendas and priorities of the CH domain. Partnerships with CH organisations are built at the local, national and international levels \(eg Royal Pavilion and Museums Brighton and Hove, Sussex Archaeological Society, Victoria & Albert Museum \(UK\), **Staatliche Museen zu Berlin \(Germany\),** Royal Museums of Art and History \(Belgium\), Fundação Getulio Vargas, and the National History Museum \(Brazil\)\). These organisations attract a combined total of \~13,000,000 visitors per year \[Source 5.1\]. This research has broadened access to 3D technologies for professionals and visitors, underpinned organisational strategies and laid the foundations for the development of multiple new projects. 

##  4.1 Broadening access to 3D technologies and processes in the CH sector 

 The legacy of the learning from the 3D\-COFORM project has continued across the whole census period. The Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels \(RMAH\), have described the 3D\-COFORM project as the ‘leverage needed to generate change’, acting as a ‘catalyst’ and a ‘knowledge resource’, for the expansion of research into an application of 3D technology \[5.2\]. At RMAH the learning has fed into a new strategy for the production and application of 3D digital objects, both on\-site and online, with the 3D\-COFORM project’s tools still in daily use at the museum \[5.2\]. Together with KU Leuven, RMAH led the Pixel\+ project \(2018\-2020\), a direct descendant of 3D\-COFORM and funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office. New technology developed in this project enables 3D depth images to be reconstructed, creating a better\-defined resource to utilise, study and preserve heritage materials. This allows professionals and the public to view centuries\-old objects and reveal hidden details, making artefacts more accessible, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. This technology was used to study the figures in the 13th\-century *Rijmbijbel* \(the oldest preserved illustrated manuscript in the Dutch language\), which led to the discovery that the heads of some of the figures were painted over at a later date. At the RMAH the technology was used to make heavily weathered texts on almost 4,000\-year\-old Egyptian figurines readable again. This technology is taking major steps forward in the documentation of CH and is an example of the standardisation of processes made possible by the 3D\-COFORM project \[5.2, 5.3\]. 

 The vision in 3D\-COFORM evolved via the European portal for Cultural Heritage, Europeana, which has made provisions for the leading role 3D CH will play in education, research and the creative industries. In 2019\-2020 a taskforce, with a cohort directly descended from the 3D\-COFORM project, developed a framework and provided guidance on publishing 3D content for cultural institutions, data creators and aggregators. 3D technology requires new approaches to all aspects of digital CH, its production, documentation, management and exploitation. ‘ *These realisations were made in 3D\-COFORM and still form the bases for today’s lines of thinking \[…\] without doubt, the ground\-breaking work carried out in 3D\-COFORM still resonates*’ \[5.2, 5.4\]. The 3D ICONS project, led by Europeana, that comprises a programme that builds on the results of 3D\-COFORM, has digitised architectural and archaeological masterpieces of world and European cultural significance providing over 1,000 3D models and related digital content to Europeana over the course of the project. The project focused on UNESCO World Heritage monuments and other monuments of outstanding value at European level, to illustrate a particular strand of Europe's history. It has become ‘ *a trail blazer for the production and publication of 3D content’* generating worldwide interest in the project’s digitisation activities with 17,830 unique visits to the online material in 157 countries \[5.5\]. 

 At the National Museums in Berlin the 3D\-COFORM project led directly to 5 new projects and twenty new collaborations that built on this knowledge, with additional investment of approximately GBP500,000 through funding in the period. The tools and technologies developed within the 3D\-COFORM project are still being employed within the organisation and the project has ‘ *opened up the door to the National Museums in Berlin for the strategic development of 3D techniques in cultural heritage. At the same time, the bases of a steadily growing 3D repository were laid. As a result of the 3D\-COFORM project, the topic of 3D reproductions and virtual representation has become one of the focal points of digital transformation.*’ The 3D\-COFORM project’s materials have been a first reference for questions in the 3D sector that are still being discussed today \[5.6\]. 

##  4.2 Directing training to deliver changes in professional practice 

 Through training and dissemination events across Europe and Brazil, UoB researchers have engaged with over 1,000 CH professionals, and provided training for more than 100 CH professionals across 10 countries since 2014. The training was tailored to the specific needs of different institutions and drew on knowledge from European and EPSRC\-funded projects and built capacity of CH practitioners on technological approaches for digitisation and reproduction of CH artefacts \[5.7\]. Individual professionals who engaged with the training reported that it was a ‘game\-changer’, providing opportunities to find new ways to preserve heritage and explore roads to test and learn new photographic techniques for digitisation and the development of new ways of working \[5.8\]. 

 The 3D\-COFORM exhibition *Reshaping History* was brought to Rio de Janeiro in 2014 after a European tour. Hosted by the Getulio Vargas Foundation \(FGV\) the exhibition was accompanied by a one\-day workshop that engaged with \~65 CH professionals. A broad set of processes and technologies for deploying 3D technologies were disseminated across the sector, many of which were more affordable and accessible to professionals. This motivated individuals and stakeholders to introduce or expand the use of 3D documentation methods in their work \[5.8\]. Thereafter, the National Museum and the National History Museum \(Rio de Janeiro\), commissioned projects deploying these technologies to capture, preserve and share knowledge on artefacts and collections with the public. A further two international workshops led by UoB and attended by 80 CH professionals from Brazil, Mexico and Egypt, took place in the UK and Brazil \(2018 and 2019\). The exchange of knowledge fulfilled the FGV’s aim to enhance the potential that technologies have in safeguarding cultural heritage assets \(sites, monuments, artefacts, intangible practices, craft etc\) which might have suffered damage, are under risk or situated within vulnerable communities. This research collaboration has been recorded as ‘invaluable’ in the advancement of FGV’s work with 3D technologies \[5.8\]. 

##  4.3 Improved digital plans enabling greater visitor access to heritage artefacts 

 UoB researchers have advanced exhibition design in the development of curation processes in museums and galleries. The Barbican House Museum and the Brighton Museum and Art Gallery feature Sussex archaeological findings including nationally significant human skulls and historical artefacts. UoB research provided a foundation for these organisations to create historically accurate 3D facial reconstructions by deploying digital workflows to produce 3D copies of human skull remains. Curators were able to display 13 previously inaccessible artefacts and had a greater flexibility of choice of artefact as a result of the digitisation process \[5.9\]. Through documenting and providing access to their collections UoB research has influenced the Royal Pavilion and Museums \(RPM\) Research Plan 2018 \- 2022 and Digital Plan 2018 – 2022. The former identified UoB research as an enabler for developing new knowledge and enhanced access to RPM’s collections whilst the latter confirmed UoB as a future partner to undertake further digitisation and build a rich narrative about RPM’s collections, buildings and knowledge \[5.9, 5.10\]. UoB’s approach to community engagement, in partnership with Future Creators, has led to positive impacts on children’s wellbeing through building a sense of identity and place, enhancing learning and encouraging children’s competencies \[5.11\]. Engagement activities involving over 190 children in primary schools between 2018 and 2020 showed improved connection with others, their communities and living heritage. The evaluation, led by Future Creators, showed an increase of 45% in participants feeling happy, a 15% increase in participants feeling liked by other people, and a 15% increase in participants reporting they coped well in difficult situations. This engagement supported children through challenging transitions including from primary to secondary school. A plan is now in place to upscale this approach to a national level \[5.11\]. 

 CH audiences benefit from improved access to fragile archaeological artefacts, natural history collections, architectural heritage and 3D artworks. This has affected certain demographics including children and young people, visually impaired and online museum visitors. The exhibits include interactive replicas \(Brighton Museum/Booth Museum\), and a web based ivory exhibit \(NHM, Rio de Janeiro\), together reaching more than 260,000 people per year. Interactive and multi\-sensory exhibits developed using UoB research significantly increased interest and engagement, proving an effective way to expand the reach of collections; the average visitor time spent on an interactive exhibit increased from 34 seconds to 2.6 minutes \[5.12\]. The use of physical replicas in relation to user needs was tested at the Booth Museum and the Blind Veterans charity \(Brighton\) and the Centre for the Education and Rehabilitation for the Blind \(CERB\) in Thessaloniki, Greece \(2019\). Visually impaired users \(18\-60\+\) reported they felt actively connected with CH, that their knowledge about heritage was enhanced and they developed awareness about the physical, urban environment, and communities locally and abroad. Feedback showed that by recognising their needs these users felt valued by the museum, experiencing equal opportunities to other museum visitors; they were not only able to visit the museum but become part of it and the ‘real\-world’. Personal reflections from these users included an emotive connection: ‘ *You almost felt that you are actually looking at the real thing.*’ ‘ *The relief gave me an understanding of putting back into a shape, back into my mind… what I was able to do in the recesses of my mind, it was to imagine...’. ‘We would be able to “travel” to a world which is unknown to someone who cannot see’* \[5.13\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Paisey’s research seeks to understand what it means to be an accounting professional at a time of increased public scrutiny and higher ethical expectations. Evidence based upon her research has \(i\) informed revisions to an International Educational Standard and a resultant policy shift to ensure that the Continuing Professional Development of almost 3 million accountants worldwide legitimises the profession’s claim to serve the public interest. Through engagement with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland \(ICAS\), Paisey’s research has \(ii\) underpinned changes to ICAS policy and practice via bold new ethics guidance for its 23,000 members, which supports speaking up and whistleblowing. In turn, this has \(iii\) influenced the wider business community \(e.g. by informing ethics policy within PwC, the UK’s largest professional services firm\). These constitute significant impacts on ethical culture and maintaining public trust. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **2.1. Context** 

 Historically, professional accountancy bodies have stressed competence, ethical practices and serving the public interest as constituents of their professional status. However, the financial scandals of the early twenty\-first century resulted in widespread mistrust of the profession. Paisey’s research has investigated the responses of professional accountancy bodies to serving the public interest through enhanced Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) and processes to ensure that they remain appropriately skilled and grounded in an ethical culture in which member integrity is seen to transcend all other business objectives. 

 **2.2. Education research** 

 Paisey’s research into the development of the accounting professional **\[3.1, 3.2\]** has a key focus on education at all stages from school, through university, to initial professional development and CPD. Having identified a gap in the CPD literature, she has published in this area since 1996, most recently publishing two outputs with N. Paisey \(Emeritus Professor, Heriot\-Watt University\) **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. Based upon an analysis of the CPD policies of twelve professional accountancy bodies, a key finding is the need for accounting CPD to relate to all accountants who are members of professional bodies. While medicine and law have clear definitions of a professional practitioner and the scope of professional work, the accountancy profession lacks such a precise definition. Thus professional accountancy bodies retain many members whose current work is diverse and not necessarily related to accountancy, even if defined broadly. 

 A key concern identified is that some influential professional bodies only require CPD to relate to their members’ current roles, rather than to accountancy itself. This results in professionally qualified members satisfying their requirement by undertaking CPD that develops competence in roles that may be devoid of accounting content. This is not the intention behind mandatory CPD, nor is it sufficient to assure the public interest claims on which the accountancy profession is based. On the other hand, making every member undertake narrowly defined CPD would result in many members undertaking CPD that is relevant to their profession but not to their role, which may not be acceptable to them. The research **\[3.3, 3.4\]** concludes that more effective CPD is therefore needed, including accounting rather than solely role\-related material, since if a professional accountant does not act competently in whatever capacity, that could reflect negatively on the profession and themselves, with consequences for wider society and the public. 

 **2.3. Ethics research** 

 Paisey’s research \(with N. Paisey and I. Tsalavoutas\) has focused on the ethical dilemmas faced by chartered accountants, including how they handle them and the support they receive. The first stage of the research **\[3.5\]** consisted of a review of academic literature on speaking up, listening up, and whistleblowing, ethics and organisational culture, followed by a questionnaire survey of Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland \(ICAS\) members building on the literature review. For the second stage **\[3.6\]**, 48 interviews were conducted, primarily with ICAS members, to gain a deeper understanding of interviewees’ real\-life ethical dilemmas and actions, and in particular their speak up, listen up and whistleblowing responses to those dilemmas. 

 The principal findings and insights from this research have been that while whistleblowing policies are commonplace in the larger firms, they are rare in smaller firms, pointing to a need for more widespread usage. The first monograph **\[3.5\]** also shows that younger members are less likely to claim to have encountered ethical dilemmas or to have spoken up. The second monograph **\[3.6\]** confirms the need for a more listening\-focused approach and shows that chartered accountants encounter very significant ethical dilemmas much more frequently than previous research had indicated. The report concludes that there is a need for more widespread use of speak up/whistleblowing policies and support for chartered accountants who face ethical dilemmas, including enhanced networking and ethical mentoring arrangements.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###   

 **4.1. Pathways to impact** 

 Paisey’s research into the accountancy profession has enhanced our understanding of the role of the profession at the beginning of the twenty\-first century. Through direct engagement with international organisations and standard\-setting boards, it has contributed directly to the worldwide restoration of public trust in the profession by shaping international education and ethics policies and practice, as outlined below: 

 **4.2. Impact on international education** 

 The International Federation of Accountants \(IFAC\) comprises more than 170 accountancy bodies in over 130 countries, representing almost 3 million accountants worldwide. Its purpose is to serve the public interest by enhancing the relevance, reputation, and value of the global accountancy profession. Paisey’s work has informed the work of two IFAC standard\-setting boards, the International Accounting Education Standards Board \(IAESB\) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants \(IESBA\). The IAESB established a range of International Accounting Standards in professional accounting education, including the mandating of CPD for all members of accountancy bodies that are members of IFAC since International Education Standard 7 \(IES7\) *Continuing Professional Development* became effective in 2006. All IFAC member bodies are obliged to adopt and implement these standards. 

 Paisey’s research underpinned a significant shift in policy in IES7 to ensure that CPD continues to legitimise the profession’s claim to serve the public interest. In August 2017, evidence from the research was submitted to the IAESB **\[5A\]**. It proposed changes to two aspects of the IES7 exposure draft: First, Paisey’s submission argued that accountants whose role was no longer within accounting should nevertheless be required, on the basis of the research findings, to undertake CPD related to the field of accounting. Second, Paisey questioned the focus on planned CPD, proposing that unplanned but relevant activities should also be included. 

 Paisey’s formal comments were discussed at IAESB meetings in November 2017 and April 2018. The minutes of the April meeting **\[5B\]** record a debate on the exposure draft wording to accord with Paisey’s first point. In July 2018, an Issues Paper recorded that: *“Based on respondent feedback \[…\] it is critical that IES7 \[revised\] make clear that IFAC member body responsibilities for CPD relate to the role of the professional accountant”*, rather than to non\-accounting roles \(p.7\-9\). This point was only made in the Paisey submission, thus the now finalised revised IES7 has been amended on the basis of Paisey’s evidence **\[5C\]**. Moreover, guidance to support the implementation of IES7 includes a discussion of the importance of unplanned as well as planned activities, a revision that aligns with Paisey’s second proposal **\[5D\]**. 

 These changes are significant in both geographical reach and regulatory depth as they ensure that the mandatory CPD of almost 3 million accountants worldwide will be undertaken in a manner that is acceptable to both individual members and to the wider profession. The IAESB Director of Skills and Assessment confirmed that: *“the new standard talks of the professional accountant, rather than the role in the accounting profession \[…\] It’s very clear now—and the explanatory material really sets out—that CPD is relevant to you as a professional accountant, regardless of the sector in which you work, regardless of the size of the organisation.”* She added: *“Individuals within professional accounting bodies will be able to better see why they need to do CPD, and take better ownership and responsibility, and therefore, the relevance because it’s there, will lead to enhanced quality of CPD being chosen”* **\[5E\]**. 

 **4.3. Impact on ICAS ethics policy and practice** 

 Paisey is a member of the Council and Ethics Board of ICAS, and through this engagement seeks to keep her research relevant to current concerns within the profession. ICAS is a professional body of more than 23,000 members and 3,000 students who work in over 100 countries around the world. The reports of Paisey’s research on the ethical experiences of chartered accountants, the dilemmas they face, and the support they would like to receive, were launched at events held by ICAS in London and Edinburgh in October 2019. The research findings were further disseminated to all ICAS members via an article in the monthly magazine *CA Today* **\[5F\]**, thus increasing member awareness of ethics dilemmas. 

 Paisey’s research is now underpinning the creation of new ICAS practitioner\-focused documents for its members under the *Power of One* motif. ICAS is currently drafting plans to implement one of the research report’s key recommendations relating to the need for a system of ethics mentoring to support members with ethical dilemmas. The ICAS CEO confirmed, *“the research has been extremely informative, insightful and useful to ICAS. It highlights the need for organisations to have appropriate mechanisms in place to encourage speak up and listen up procedures and the benefits that they can bring to organisational culture \[…\] the research has assisted ICAS to identify areas where greater attention and focus is required in order to better meet the needs of members and also to serve its public interest mandate.”* **\[5G\]**. As a direct result of the research and in order to assist its members, *“ICAS decided to further the offering by facilitating access for its members to advice provided by Protect”*. Other initiatives in progress in Autumn 2020, which directly stem from the research, include a focus on bullying via a webinar and associated guidance, and the establishment of an ethics mentoring facility to support members with ethical dilemmas **\[5G\]**. 

 The research has also supported ICAS submissions to two reviews. First, ICAS included Paisey’s research findings in its submission to the UK Financial Reporting Council’s consultation on revisions to the Corporate Governance Code. Second, in its comments on the Exposure Draft on the Role and Mindset Expected of Professional Accountants, issued by IESBA \(the international standard\-setting ethics board\), ICAS proposed that: *“to ensure a successful organisational culture, employees need to feel they can speak up about concerns without retribution, that their concerns are listened to, and, most importantly, are followed up”*. ICAS evidenced this by means of appending links to Paisey’s two monographs at the end of its submission **\[5H\]**. The need for this additional inclusion in the exposure draft was discussed at the December 2019 meeting **\[5I\]** and included in the marked\-up copy of the proposed exposure draft **\[5J\]**, which includes reference to protection for whistleblowers as part of the promotion of an ethical culture. The ICAS CEO confirmed: *“This assisted in ensuring that the IESBA Task Force in charge of this project considered the need for inclusion of a specific reference to whistleblowing in relation to possible new content on organisational culture”* **\[5G\]**. 

 **4.4. Impact on the wider international business community** 

 The findings and recommendations from Paisey’s research are also relevant to the wider business community. ICAS has sent the reports to various international bodies; for example, the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants has uploaded links to the two reports on its  [website](https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/building-trust-ethics/discussion/when-do-you-speak-listen-whistleblow). The Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment \(CISI\) also believe that the results contain important messages for their members, and hence participated in the research monograph launch events with ICAS. In addition, the Head of Professional Standards at CISI invited Paisey to deliver a presentation in Cyprus in November 2019, writing that: *“while your research focused primarily on Chartered Accountants, I strongly feel that your findings \[…\] are relevant for all professionals – including those CISI members working within securities, investment, wealth and financial planning”* **\[5K\]**. 

 Other international organisations have found the research useful in clarifying or supporting their thinking, informing policy evaluation \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5L\]**\). For instance, PwC is the largest professional services firm in the UK with revenues of GBP4.2bn in 2019 and approximately 25,000 employees. PwC’s Ethics Partner commented that: *“the information \[in the research monographs\] about the experience of the wider accounting profession was helpful in contextualising the reports we receive on our Speak Up facility”*. He confirmed that PwC had been reviewing its own in\-house Speak Up facility and wrote that the research findings were, *“helpful in considering the specifications of the new arrangements”* and added, *‘I particularly found the focus in the Report on “Listen Up” of interest and supportive of views emerging within PwC as to how best to handle whistleblowing in its widest sense’* **\[5L\]**. 

 **4.5. Beneficiaries** 

 Taken together, Paisey’s education and ethics research has highlighted issues that need to be addressed by the accountancy profession, professional firms and other organisations \(these practitioners are the primary beneficiaries of the research\). This has led to changes to professional services in order to provide a culture in which accountants \(and professionals in other sectors\) effectively maintain professional competence and feel able to speak up where they have concerns, both of which are necessary conditions for public trust and the protection of the public interest \(therefore, the public are secondary beneficiaries of this research\).

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Virtual reality \(VR\) is a ground\-breaking technology in principle, but in practice most of its applications have been inspired by established cinematic and gaming forms. Goldsmiths' Computing Department has provided the milieu for a cross\-disciplinary collaboration which brings together visual art, software engineering and scientific modelling to create a suite of highly original VR experiences with deep and diverse social and scientific impacts. 

 William Latham and Frederic Fol Leymarie’s Mutator platform enables users to immerse themselves in experientially rich virtual landscapes, based on rigorous mathematical modelling of biological systems. This has led to the creation of a family of pioneering VR experiences that are evocative \(as art\), illuminating \(as scientific visualisations\), educational \(as models of biological processes\) and entertaining \(as immersive games\). 

 These have secured deep engagement with international cultural audiences, found significant real\-world applications in science and more recently attracted significant commercial interest. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 William Latham pioneered the use of evolutionary algorithms – those that mimic biological processes – in computer graphics at IBM's UK Scientific Centre in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The products of the FormGrow system were appreciated both as art \(exhibited in galleries\) and in popular culture \(via the ""rave"" scene\) but rooted in rigorous mathematical modelling by the biologist William Hamilton and software engineering by computer scientist Stephen Todd. Frederic Leymarie founded Goldsmiths' pioneering MA in Computational Arts and in 2005 invited Latham to present his work. That began a process of increasing engagement and collaboration which culminated in Latham becoming a professor at Goldsmiths in 2007. 

 **Computer art:** The initial focus was to reimplement, update and expand FormGrow, the result being the Mutator modelling and visualisation platform. Mutator has been used to create a range  of experiences with diverse applications, but which all allow their users to generate and explore limitless new worlds. **\[R1\]** These environments, and their simulated inhabitants, react and develop according to accurate biological principles. **\[R2**\] The initial screen\-based presentation was implemented as a series of immersive virtual reality environments from 2016 onwards.

| **Visualisation:** Because the system renders millions of points of scientific data into a custom model, controlled by a novel but carefully designed user interface using standard VR hardware, it became apparent that the platform could also support scientific visualisations if applied to actual biological systems. Latham and Leymarie, working with collaborators at Imperial College, Oxford University and the University of York, developed systems – FoldSynth and CSynth **\[R3,R4\]** – which give both laypeople and researchers an intuitive way to explore and understand the structure, composition and function of biological molecules, including DNA, proteins and entire viruses such as SARS\-COV\-2.  **Outreach:** The visualisation work found substantial application in public outreach, which became the focus of a subsequent project with Imperial College. Between 2013 and 2017, the partners developed BioBlox an educational game allowing laypeople to explore how proteins “dock” with each other, as well as 3D graphical tools for scientists. **\[R5\]**  This work was funded by a four\-year, £1m BBSRC grant and is now being expanded to illustrate the molecular mechanisms used by Covid\-19.  The common strand through each of these four areas of development is the combination of intensive data modelling, a novel interface and gamification, applied to both real and simulated biological systems. There is also a shared emphasis on cross\-disciplinary collaboration, rapid prototyping and development through iteration – a combination uniquely facilitated by the culture and objectives of Goldsmiths' Computing Department. **\[R6\]** Typically Latham works with collaborators to identify realisable areas of mutual interest; Leymarie supplies the mathematical modelling and Todd the software engineering needed to implement it. Releases are driven by outreach at public events, which allows feedback to be gathered and acted upon quickly, as well as attracting further collaborators. |

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **1: Large and diverse audiences for a new form of art** 



 *Image: Mutator VR Vortex exhibited at the Kinninji Buddhist Temple in Kyoto, March 2019* 

 Mutator VR allows users to create and explore virtual landscapes that are procedurally generated from mathematical rules and inhabited by organisms which obey biological principles. Each experience is unique as users explore endless worlds, unseen and unheard until called into existence. There are now several variants – Vortex, FormScape and Tadpoles – which explore different permutations of interaction with the environments and their occupants. **\[S1\]** 

 These new artefacts have been continuously exhibited at major international cultural venues. For example, during 2019/20 they were featured in public exhibitions at such globally renowned institutions as The Lowry in Manchester; the Pompidou Centre in Paris; the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the Modern Art Museum in Shanghai. They have also appeared in numerous less formal locations, ranging from the Shoom 30 rave to the New Scientist Live science festival and the Kennin\-iji Buddhist Temple in Kyoto. **\[S2\]** 

 This has exposed the work to a far larger and more diverse audience than is typical for computer art. For example, at New Scientist Live, 2,300 people experienced MutatorVR for themselves, while its presence as an ""anchor"" exhibit with large\-scale projection meant it would have been apparent to all 25,000 visitors to the event. This is all the more impressive given the challenges of mounting such exhibits. 

 ""Taking VR artworks in exhibitions like the public realm festival Lightwaves 2018 and gallery exhibition The State of US \[at The Lowry, Manchester\] both have challenges. They both produce a high footfall of public engagement and the artworks have to adapt to high levels of audience interaction whilst also producing a rich artistic interaction for the public,"" says Lucy Dusgate, the producer at The Lowry responsible for Mutator's appearance in both these shows. ""Working closely with Professor Latham enabled us to jointly develop and adapt the artwork to address these key issues … We were particularly impressed and received public feedback that the artwork was engaging for all ages, social demographics and produced an accessible and seamless high\-quality experience for audiences. It effortlessly created a learning environment that captivated curiosity and encouraged broad participation in the learning."" **\[S3\]** 

 This appeal has proven to be globally applicable, even in cultures that might not be considered receptive to VR art. ""Asians prefer expression of the world so that it looks like nature in our real world rather than a pure virtual world. Therefore, it is a big challenge for \[Latham\] and me to exhibit the Mutator VR in Japan,""  writes Naoko Tosa of Kyoto University. Nonetheless, it was shown at Kyoto's oldest Zen temple, where ""interestingly and fortunately against our worry, most of the visitors … appreciated the exhibition. This means the worldview expressed by the Mutator VR is global and could be understood and shared by people over the world."" **\[S3\]** 

 **2. Illuminating visualisations help scientists share their research**

 Molecular biology deals in microscopic entities – proteins, genes, viruses – whose structures are enormously complicated and whose behaviour is radically unintuitive. It thus presents a challenging communication problem, despite its fundamental importance and applications in healthcare. 

 ""A significant outcome of this work meant we developed several high\-profile public engagement experiences with CSynth at the core. This work was initially funded by a Wellcome Trust Public Engagement award and called “DNA Origami: How do you fold a genome?” and resulted in worldwide coverage and exposure of our research to thousands of members of the public,"" says Stephen Taylor, Head of the Computational Biology Research Group at the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford. 

 Visualisations of protein docking and of viral structures have been shown to the general public at high\-profile outreach events including New Scientist Live, the Imperial Spark Festival, the Royal Society Summer Exhibition, the Cheltenham Science Festival and at the Crick Institute to inform public understanding of scientific research. Inclusion in these events is highly competitive and selected work must be scientifically rigorous while also accessible to the public. **\[S4\]** 

 ""The Virus VR set up to illustrate our latest research in the modelling of viruses based on our paper “Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle” on virus tilings in the journal Nature Communications in 2019 … has been very well received by the general public and has changed their perception of the importance of Mathematics in Virology as the feedback forms demonstrate,"" writes Professor Reidun Twarock of the University of York, including comments such as “A clear visual look at mathematical structures in biology” and “I didn’t know how important mathematics were in understanding viruses before I used the VR”. 

 ""Such outreach projects that are designed to change perceptions on the impact of mathematical research in virology are even more important at present in view of the current Covid\-19 pandemic, as they illustrate the contributions academia is making to the health sector, and highlight the solutions that science has to offer to society."" **\[S5\]** 

 **3\) Educational games inform young people’s understanding of how viruses work** 

 Bioblox is a free mobile game for young people, ages 11\-18, which demonstrates how proteins dock. Users drag, rotate and swipe to move protein shaped ‘jigsaw pieces’ around the screen in a manner akin to Tetris. This is an important problem in molecular biology and understanding it is key to developments in medicine and public health, as testified to by the £1m in funding granted to the project by the BBSRC. **\[S6\]** 

 
This topical game has been endorsed by games industry bodies Ukie and TIGA. The latter's CEO, Richard Wilson noted: ""It is timely to see Goldsmiths and Imperial Researchers using games technology to promote understanding of the corona virus, medical science and social distancing in a very novel way"". **\[S7\]** The game was rated the second\-best educational app for Android by Science Focus magazine in September 2020. 

 The collaboration's public\-facing, iterative approach to research and development has led to continuing collaborations with an increasingly diverse set of partners. For example: 

-  Showing the work in Shanghai led to a Visiting Professorship for William Latham at Jiao Tong University and the commissioning of a major ""Master Studio"" retrospective exhibition and lecture series, funded by JTU, to be delivered in 2020/21. **\[S8\]** 

-  Exhibiting MutatorVR led to discussions with the R&D division of hardware manufacturer HTC Vive. This has in turn led to a memorandum of understanding with the University of Maryland to investigate if MutatorVR can be used in pain relief for medical patients. **\[S9\]** 

-  Work done on virus modelling with partners at the University of York under a Wellcome Trust award is now underway to turn genetic information into musical notes. The objective is to create an instrument that will simultaneously play music and simulate genetic mutation, illustrating this important concept in an accessible way. **\[S10\]** 

-  Adding generative audio to the MutatorVR set\-up has created a compelling but highly intuitive creative platform combining sight, sound and movement. This has attracted substantial interest from major music labels and games companies and is being prepared for spin\-out as a standalone commercial company.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by Lewis has played a central role in transformation of the protection available to whistleblowers nationally and internationally. In the 2014\-20 period this research further raised the public profile of whistleblowing, including via the International Whistleblowing Research Network hosted by Lewis at Middlesex, to produce two areas of impact. First, through *changing employer practice on whistleblowing in large public and private sector employers,* including the NHS and Irish Garda. Here, the introduction of codes of practice directly drawing on Lewis’ work shifted mechanisms of corporate and organisational accountability in respect of whistleblowing and improved employment protection for millions of workers. Second, evidence\-led *reshaping of legislation to protect whistleblowers internationally* resulted from Lewis’ work, informing the conceptualisation and drafting of whistleblowing law and policy. Notably this included the development of a new EU directive in 2019, covering not only the 27 EU member states of the EU but also influencing legislative development across a wider number of Council of Europe countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to the whistleblowing research undertaken at Middlesex University Business School during the 1990s, little scholarly interest had been shown in whistleblower protection. Researchers at Middlesex in the field of employment relations \(Lewis, Sargeant\) collaborated with staff in the Law School \(Barrett, Homewood\) initially in relation to employment protection for environmental whistleblowers. With publication of his edited volume Whistleblowing at Work in 2001, Lewis led the development of a body of research published across business ethics, employee relations and law journals, which clarified and defined both the principles on which whistleblowing statutes are founded in different countries, and the essential practical features of whistleblowing policies and procedures. This research has raised understanding of the importance of protection of whistleblowers nationally and internationally, with research findings making major contributions to promoting employer good practice and shaping the development of government legislation and guidelines. 

 *\(1\) Improving employer practice and understanding whistleblowers* 

 Empirical research into employer practice in relation to whistleblowing began with projects funded by the Employers Organisation for Local Government and the Nuffield Foundation. This focused on public sector whistleblowing procedures and then developed in relation to the practice of FTSE top 250 companies via major surveys funded by the British Academy \(2007\) and Sai Global \(2010\). 

 On the basis of this expertise, in 2014 the UK Department of Health commissioned Lewis to conduct quantitative research for the independent *Freedom to Speak Up* \(FTSU\) review of the NHS chaired by Sir Robert Francis. Findings showed defects in existing NHS procedures as regards encouraging whistleblowing and handling reports of wrongdoing and identified preferred mechanisms for both staff and employers in improving practice \[1\]. A quarter of survey respondents did not know whether or not their employer had a confidential reporting procedure. Where staff were aware of procedures, a lack of trust in the system and fear of victimisation hindered reporting. When concerns were raised, 20% of respondents indicated they were then ignored by management and 17% actively victimised by management. The research evidenced that those who did follow their employer's procedure when raising a concern had better outcomes, and identified measures to make it more likely that workers would raise concerns. These included an ability to raise a concern anonymously, an undertaking by the employer to protect a person’s identity, and the presence of an independent person or organisation to receive information about concerns staff wished to raise; aspects of good practice equally applicable to both public and private sectors. 

 Further research into institutional frameworks for protecting whistleblowers and responding to their concerns, explored the roles that trade unions might adopt in order to improve responsiveness in the whistleblowing process \[2\]. This research demonstrated a key role for trade unions in negotiating whistleblowing procedures, advising and representing their members, and raising collective concerns on behalf of the workforce, as well as in ensuring that proven wrongdoing was rectified and whistleblowers did not suffer retaliation. Research from the employee perspective studied the motivation to whistleblow and the impacts on the whistleblower. Findings identified key factors influencing the decision to whistleblow, especially morality and emotion, and the demonstrable effect of perceived negative consequences on the intention to whistleblow. Study of the costs on whistleblowers in terms of their jobs, economic security, physical health and mental well\-being, demonstrated negative health effects, and the implications of this for whistleblower protection \[3\]. 

 *\(2\) Whistleblowing legislation and enforcement* 

 Following initial research from 2001 into the position of whistleblowing in relation to employment and discrimination law within the UK, Lewis pioneered comparative research into statutory provisions for whistleblowing and their effect in Australia, the US and UK \(2004\), developed further through studies in South Africa \(with Uys, 2007\) and Norway \(with Trygstad, 2009\). This research demonstrated how national legislation on disclosure reflected different labour relations systems and democratic values, and the importance of enforcing statutory whistleblowing protection via an accessible legal system. In the UK, Lewis’s comprehensive analysis of the effects of 20 years of legislation showed the limited objectives of the legislation, its restricted personal and material scope, its complex requirements, and inadequate mechanisms for obtaining redress following victimisation. 

 Research into the relationship between employment law and other civil law jurisdictions clarified the interplay between whistleblowing and defamation. This demonstrated that defamation laws exposed whistleblowers to redress from persons innocently, but falsely, accused of wrongdoing, and argued whistleblowers should have absolute rather than qualified privilege if they made a protected disclosure \[4\]. Findings highlighted the unique role whistleblowers play in struggles against corruption and labour market abuses, where detection and enforcement are difficult. The lack of an effective labour inspectorate in the UK meant enforcement authorities relied on information about wrongdoing supplied by individual workers, as well as trade unions, competing employers and the public \[5\]. 

 A critical review of international official guidelines on whistleblowing procedures produced by Lewis and Vandekerckhove \(2012\) examined the principles on which legislation should be based and what constituted good management practice. Lewis subsequently developed this analysis to set out the case for a specific EU Directive on whistleblowing, showing the value of such a Directive in getting Member States to first base in whistleblowing arrangements and encouraging other countries to do likewise. This also argued that to achieve best practice in legislative provision, Member States would need to go beyond the minimum standards specified in the Directive \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Lewis’ research has raised the public profile of the significance of whistleblowing, highlighting the public interest in encouraging whistleblowing and showing that this interest cannot be adequately protected by general employment measures. Dissemination and review of specialist findings via the *International Whistleblowing Research Network* \(IWRN\) hosted by Lewis at Middlesex since 2008, has contributed to a new public profile for whistleblowing. The growing IWRN comprised of over 200 researchers, practitioners and policy makers from across the world has encouraged networking and dissemination of research and good practice including via regular conferences \(Sarajevo, 2015; Oslo, 2017; Utrecht, 2019\). In 2014, Lewis, with colleagues, edited and contributed to the landmark *International Whistleblowing Research Handbook* \[5.1\] widely read internationally by policy makers, and practitioners. Middlesex University has also sponsored the *Whistleblower of the Year Award* since 2013, presented to an individual or organisation in recognition of outstanding achievement in making a disclosure of information in the public interest \[5.2\]. Winners, selected by a five\-person international jury drawn from IWRN, have included whistleblowers from Oxfam, HMRC and the NHS, and have attracted considerable media coverage. 

 Lewis has been routinely engaged by a range of governmental, non\-governmental organisations and political parties to advocate protection for whistleblowers, including involvement in Transparency International and The Green Party’s agenda\-setting “Directive” on whistleblowing in 2015, through to advising on the whistleblowing provisions in the Labour Party’s Industrial Relations Bill in 2019 and the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on whistleblowing in 2020. His contribution through commissioned studies, professional presentations, and evidence to businesses, governments and other bodies, has provided an evidence base for work towards reform, moving from a relative lack of public and political awareness of whistleblowing principles, policies and benefits to the introduction of corporate and legal initiatives in many countries. Impact has been evident in two areas: changed employer practice towards whistleblowers; and the reshaping of legislation internationally to protect whistleblowers. 

####  Changed employer practice on whistleblowing 

 The former Chair of the Industrial Law Society states of Lewis that: “ *His work has influenced mechanisms of organisational accountability in relation to whistleblowing through the introduction of codes of practice and guidelines that directly draw upon his research findings, which have been especially influential on large public and private sector employers*” \[5.3\]. In 2013, the UK's leading online Human Resources organisation Xpert HR, in seeking evidence\-led processes towards reform and innovation related to whistleblowing, commissioned Lewis to produce a widely used, comprehensive “Guide to good practice” and subsequent quarterly updates. This comprehensive good practice guide has been extensively used since by Xpert HR’s customers, which are spread across 45 countries, and employ one in four of the workforce and include one in three FTSE\-100 companies in the UK \[5.4\]. 

 A number of recommendations made by the 2015 *Francis FTSU Report* incorporated Lewis’ findings on defects in existing NHS whistleblowing procedures. Of the 20 principles identified to create an open and honest report culture in the NHS in the Francis report, six related directly to Lewis’s research findings: principle 3, on culture free from bullying; principle 7 on raising and reporting concerns; principle 8 on investigations; principle 10 on training; principle 11 on support; and principle 19 on primary care \[5.5\]. For principle 20, on enhancement of legal protection, Lewis advised the report author directly on the failure of the law to protect against discrimination against whistleblowers at the point of hiring. UCL Partners subsequently commissioned Lewis to deliver training workshops \(2016\-2017\) on the implications of the FTSU review, which encouraged human resource practitioners to base their own tailored approaches on underpinning principles and evidence. The principles of the Francis review not only shaped major changes in whistleblowing report culture in the NHS \(notably principles 7,8,10,11\) \- the UK’s largest employer of 1.2m staff \- but have been widely drawn on by other organisations across the public and private sectors \[5.3\]. A subsequent study of published procedures used by the FTSE top 100 firms showed how these principles have been widely applied in these companies \[5.6\]. 

 In 2016, in response to growing public controversy over the provision of a safe environment for whistleblowing in the Garda Síochána, Lewis was contracted by the Irish Policing Authority to review their policy and procedures for the making of protected disclosures. The review’s recommendations identified changes to ensure compliance with the 2014 Protected Disclosures Act regarding who could make a protected disclosure, how to make a protected disclosure, the role of the protected disclosures manager, and employee safeguards. Following consultation on the review, in November 2016 the Irish Policy Authority published a *Report of the policing authority on the Garda Síochána protected disclosures* policy. This set out 17 recommendations and led to the Garda’s introduction of an amended policy to cover its 15,000 workforce in 2017 \[5.7\]. 

 As part of work to embed an overall shift of employment culture internationally, since 2015, Lewis has served as a member of the British Standards Institute working party preparing an international standard on whistleblowing. This ISO standard will be the international benchmark for all whistleblowing policies and is expected to be agreed in 2021. 

####  Reshaping legislation internationally to protect whistleblowers 

 The whistleblowing model Lewis first proposed in 1995 in relation to the UK of protecting whistleblowers via employment protection rights, has since informed the conceptualisation and drafting of legislation and policy internationally, particularly as countries have recognised the value of whistleblowing legislation in fighting corruption. In 2016 a three\-day UNODC anti\-corruption mission to Liberia aimed at training judges and senior civil servants across 12 West African countries, engaged Lewis as a whistleblowing expert. The resulting *Monrovia Statement on Whistle\-blower and Witness Protection in West Africa* \[5.8\], jointly drafted by Lewis, was adopted by all participants to facilitate the establishment of effective whistleblower and witness protection systems within these 12 nation states. In Japan, Lewis provided evidence based on his empirical research and expertise on international best practice to a national committee in 2019, as part of an impact review of their 2005 Whistleblower Protection Act. In Australia, Lewis was adviser on the Griffith University’s *Whistle while you work* project, funded by the Australian Research Council Linkage scheme, as well as recent legislation providing whistleblowing rights under existing workplace arrangements. 

 In Europe Lewis has worked with particular European states to develop frameworks for whistleblower protection, particularly with a view to tackling corruption. Following Lewis’ address to a major OECD anti\-corruption workshop in Athens in 2017, he was commissioned by the Council of Europe as part of the *Project against Economic Crime in Kosovo* \(PECK\) to contribute to drafting a whistleblowing statute, subsequently enacted in Kosovo in 2018 \[5.9\]. The Council of Europe’s “highly positive experience” of engaging Lewis \[5.10\] led them to further commission Lewis in 2020 to produce two technical reports in support of action against economic crime in North Macedonia. These reports informed major revisions of existing legislation to enhance the protections provided to whistleblowers in Northern Macedonia. A resulting draft law is currently undergoing Parliamentary review with expected adoption in early 2021 \[5.10\]. 

 The impact of Lewis’ expertise and advocacy is most notable through his contribution in pushing the EU to adopt a whistleblower protection Directive, overcoming opposition from those who argued there was no legal basis or political will for such a measure. Previously in 2011, in oral and written evidence to the Budgetary Control Committee of the European Parliament, Lewis had urged the introduction of EU\-wide whistleblowing measures. In 2017, he was called on as one of two academic experts to advise during the consultation process, including participation in the DG Justice workshop in Brussels shaping the Directive \[5.11\]. In 2019, *Directive \(EU\) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law,* was adopted. Prior to this Directive, there was no EU measure devoted solely to whistleblowing. The Directive draws directly on Lewis’ body of research, which demonstrates the need to set detailed standards for handling concerns, offer wide access to whistleblowing procedures, ensure confidentiality, provide effective deterrents to retaliation, and access to justice. The Directive provides minimum standards for all member states and requires member states to put in place relevant legislation. The Directive was transposed in December 2021, with member states now consulting and drafting national legislation on their whistleblowing practices and procedures. Beyond direct impact on the 446 million population of the 27 EU member states, the Directive will have a further effect on countries wishing to join or trade with the EU. The 47 Council of Europe countries have been formally urged to comply with this Directive, and several have taken steps to do so, including North Macedonia and Kosovo, as advised by Lewis.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study details impacts arising from the work of **Mairs Dyer and Baker**. In research\-led civic projects such as *Women’s Vision from Across the Barricades \(WVAB\)* and *Traditions in Transition \(TiT\),* **Mairs Dyer** and **Baker** worked collaboratively with marginalized social groups, leading to impacts in: 

 **\(I1\)** enabling cultural understanding amongst marginalized groups in Northern Ireland, encouraging them to think critically and reflexively about how they are perceived in the media. 

 **\(I2\)** informing debate between and across marginalized republican and loyalist communities in Northern Ireland about the role of the media and how they might find their own voice and engage in their own media activism. 

 **\(I3\)** cultivating the autonomous self\-expression of working\-class women and men in loyalist and republican North Belfast by providing them with key media literacy skills and technical production skills. 

 **\(I4\)** engendering the political empowerment of hitherto marginalized groups by convincing them that they have a right to occupy the public realm and engage in a public discourse aimed at addressing matters of social and political importance in their locale, as well as in the broader political public sphere.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Mairs Dyer** and **Baker’s** work is defined by a commitment to socially purposive research and civic engagement. *Women’s Vision* *from Across the Barricades* emerged out of a dialogue between **Mairs Dyer** and various North Belfast women’s groups, resulting in the publication of a volume of photographs or photobook. *Traditions in Transition* began as a project looking at the media representation of Ulster Loyalism. It resulted in a report authored by **Baker**, which was submitted to the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland \(OFMDFM\). Subsequently Baker collaborated on a documentary film, released as a DVD with an accompanying essay, an abbreviated version of his OFMDFM report. 

 **Mairs Dyer’s** and **Baker’s** underpinning research combines traditional academic scholarship \(i.e., monographs, peer\-reviewed journal articles\) with related impactful civic activity and media outputs \(i.e., film, photobook\). It is important to understand that these two things – the academic scholarship and the impactful civic activity – *happen in tandem,* *forming a virtuous circle or feedback loop of mutual imbrication and influence*. In other words, it would be too simplistic to say that **Baker** and **Mairs Dyer** conduct their underpinning research and use their findings to then drive or initiate impact. Rather, *it would be more precise to say that the impactful civic activity shapes their research scholarship and findings as much the research and findings drive the impact.* 

 For many years now, **Baker** has been interested in how dominant media and other elite narratives tend to marginalize specific groups in Northern Ireland. Through researching and writing his monograph *The British Media and Bloody Sunday,* 2016 **\(R1\),** **Baker** became increasingly aware of the political urgency of finding out why it is so difficult for certain marginalized groups in contemporary Northern Irish society to think critically about how they are perceived in the media, and how problematic it is for such groups to better understand the political influence of the media, find their own voice, and engage in their own media activism. These key insights or findings relate to impacts **\(I1\), \(12\)**. It is no accident that the writing of the *Bloody Sunday* book happened at the same time **Baker** was deepening his engagement with marginalized groups outside the academy. On the one hand, **Baker’s** involvement in civic projects like the *Traditions in Transition* project represented a concrete translation of his insights into a real\-world and phenomenologically rich setting. On the other hand, his findings and insights were also critically reflected back to him through his experiences of working with others on the project. These experiences then informed not just the emerging intellectual trajectory and writing of his monograph, but his subsequent research work. For example, in his article, ‘Tribeca Belfast and the On\-Screen Regeneration of Northern Ireland’, 2020, **\(R2\)** **Baker**, drawing directly on his civic engagement with marginalized groups, began to think more purposefully about how screen culture need not simply be a vehicle for reproducing dominant and exclusionary narratives, but one that it could also challenge such narratives by providing the means for those hitherto excluded to better represent themselves in the broader political public sphere. This key insight relates to **\(I4\).** 

  

 Similarly, **Mairs Dyer** has, for many years, been interested in how we can encourage marginalized groups to think about how they may find their own voice and engage in their own media activism. This was a core insight and problem she wanted to explicitly address in her photobook project, *Women’s Vision from Across the Barricades, 2015*. **\(R3\)** During this project, **Mairs Dyer** became acutely aware of the political urgency of finding ways to explore how co\-creative and collaborative forms of media activism with marginalized groups could lead to their political empowerment through autonomous self\-expression, better informing discussion across and between disenfranchised communities, as well as in the broader public sphere. These key insights relate to impacts **\(I2\), \(I3\), \(I4\)**. The experiences, insights and findings garnered by **Mairs Dyer** through her civic engagement informed subsequent research. That is to say, the photobook project didn’t simply work by downloading a pre\-determined understanding or methodology of collaborative media practice, but, rather, brought such a media practice and methodology to life in a real\-world and phenomenologically rich setting. The insights and findings gained in her collaborative exchanges in *WVAB* informed **Mairs Dyer’s** more recent article: *‘The risks and benefits of collaborative documentary filmmaking in post\-conflict Northern Ireland: an analysis of participant and audience responses to telling and hearing stories from the Troubles’, 2019*. **\(R4\)**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **\(I1\)** **enabling cultural understanding amongst marginalized groups in Northern Ireland, encouraging them to think critically and reflexively about how they are perceived in the media.** 

  

 **Baker’s** *Traditions in Transition* project and documentary film grew out of a cross\-community initiative that brought together residents, young people and ethnic minorities in flashpoint areas of Belfast. Funded by the OFMDFM, ‘The Belfast Interface Project’ commissioned a report from **Baker** looking at the media image and public reputation of Ulster loyalism. **Baker** submitted the report in 2015 and it laid the foundations for the *Traditions in Transition* documentary film. The director of the *Traditions in Transition* documentary **\(C1\)** emphasised how **Baker’s** research was crucial to the project: *“Throughout the Traditions in Transition project **Baker** was able to translate many of the profound insights from a book like his* The British Media and Bloody Sunday *in ways that made sense to those involved in the project, thereby immediately encouraging them to think in profound ways about how they are perceived in the media”*. 

  

 The *Traditions in Transition* project operated within a broader set of cross\-community initiatives that **Baker** is involved in through the auspices of organizations like *Expac* and *Trademark*. *Trademark*, the anti\-sectarian unit of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, works in the field of cross\-community relations and political education. The Co\-Director of *Trademark* **\(C2\)** remarked on **Baker’s** *“significant and measurable contribution to both Trademark’s anti\-sectarian work and political education programmes…Through sharing his research work, in particular insights from his brilliant book* The British Media and Bloody Sunday *, he has become a central figure in shaping the critical thinking of participants regarding how they are perceived in the media…, inspiring and enfranchising hitherto voiceless and marginalized citizens to make themselves better heard in broader cultural and political life”*. **Also \(I4\)** 

  

 **\(I2\) informing debate between and across marginalized republican and loyalist communities in Northern Ireland about the role of the media and how they might find their own voice and engage in their own media activism.** 

  

 **Baker’s** *Traditions in Transition* project operates within a broader ecology of community initiatives and he has strong and ongoing links to community organizations such as *Expac*. *Expac* is an ex\-prisoner’s organization that engages with marginalized republican and loyalist community groups seeking to afford each an insight into the thinking and outlook of the other. As the *Expac* Project Manager **\(C3\)** points out: “ *The impact of Dr **Baker** has been to facilitate a more informed debate within and across marginalized republican and loyalist communities about the role of the media in society and how it touches their lives in particular. Most of these groups feel ignored, misunderstood or misrepresented by press and broadcasters, but Dr **Baker**’ **s** research work has encouraged them to think about how they might find their own voice an engage in their own media activism.*” **Also \(I1\)** 

  

 **Mairs Dyer’s** *Women’s Vision from Across the Barricades \(WVAB\)* project and photobook involved an engagement with marginalized constituents \(bringing together, for the first time, a group of women from Protestant\-Unionist\-Loyalist and Catholic\-Nationalist\-Republican working\-class interface areas of North Belfast\). Beyond the specific impacts on the participants involved in the project \- detailed below in **\(I3\)** and **\(I4\)** \- the photobook has found a place in the broader public sphere as part of The Linen Hall Library Collection in Belfast, NI. More significantly, it has also been acquired by a well\-known British photographer as part of a photobook collection curated for, and held at, the Tate, London. The Director of Learning and Research at Tate **\(C7\)** expressed “ *delight at its presence in Tate’s collection”,* referring to the photobook as a *“significant and impactful piece of community art and media activism that importantly, and very publicly, foregrounds the voices of women too often drowned out in contemporary Northern Irish society”*.  **Also \(I4\)** 

  

 **\(I3\)** **cultivating the autonomous self\-expression of working\-class women and men in loyalist and Republican North Belfast by providing them with key media literacy skills and technical production skills.** 

  

 The co\-creative or co\-productive nature of **Mairs Dyer’s** photobook was central to the project, allowing for autonomous self\-expression in a group whose voices are rarely heard in public space. One participant **\(C4\)** stated, *“I think the fact \(we\) were taught how to take photographs was something that was new…\(We\) actually went out and took photographs of what it was that \(we\) were unhappy about...It was about \(…\) our social expression through photographs because \(we\) were unable \(…\) to get around the table to voice these and that’s why the book really came about”*. **Also \(I2\), \(I4\)** Another participant in **Mairs Dyer’s** photobook project **\(C5\)** confirmed that this type of autonomous and creative expression challenges the silencing of *“ordinary women who are trying to improve their community and who don’t have their voices heard. I believe that we achieved that as a collective by doing that book because they can’t silence that book.”*  **Also** **\(I2\), \(I4\).** 

  

 In a similar vein, the director of the *Traditions in Transition* film **\(C1\)** emphasised how **Baker’s** research and contribution became part of an ongoing co\-creative exchange with the filming team. As he says: “ *Dr **Baker** didn’t just provide broad ideas for the filming team, he worked very closely with us on how we framed the work visually. He was instrumental in influencing various aesthetic and technical choices made during the making of the film, advice that was significant for the team as they set about expressing themselves through the film”.* 

  

 **\(I4\) engendering the political empowerment of hitherto marginalized groups by convincing them that they have a right to occupy the public realm and engage in a public discourse aimed at addressing matters of social and political importance in their locale, as well as in the broader political public sphere.** 

  

 *Traditions in Transition* was screened to a variety of community groups and it was shown at Irish Joint Secretary of the British Irish Secretariat’s residence in Belfast on Thursday 26th May 2016.  Following that event, 1,000 copies of *Traditions in Transition* were produced and distributed, accompanied by an essay based on the original report written for OFMDFM.  As the director of the *Traditions in Transition* **\(C1\)** pointed out: “ *Traditions in Transition enabled participants to begin a more positive and confident public engagement with others, evident in the encounter with the Irish Joint Secretary.”* 

  

 Just as the *Traditions in Transition* film facilitated a direct exchange with key political actors, so too did the *WVAB* photobook, distributed, as it was, to prominent local politicians. Indeed, the political significance and impact of this project is immediately evidenced in the appearance of the photobook itself, launched in October 2015 by a former MLA and the then leader of the *Progressive Unionist Party* in Northern Ireland.  A participant **\(C4\)** confirmed that *“every politician in North Belfast got that book”. The group even managed to present a copy to Northern Ireland’s First Minister.* The participant **\(C4\)** stated *, “I gave it to her; and I put ‘trust women’ on the front of it.”* 

  

 It is important to again underline how the co\-productive nature of **Mairs Dyer’s** photobook project engendered the political empowerment of these hitherto marginalized groups of women. For not only did the photobook highlight current challenges faced by the women, it also emboldened and convinced them that they had a right to engage in a public discourse that aimed to address the immediate, real\-world, issues on their doorstep. For example, the women used images from the photobook to kick\-start public conversations around issues of social housing and, specifically, allowed them to call for the removal of paramilitary flags from a nearby children’s playground. In relation to the latter, one participant **\(C6\)** reflected on how, “ *we \(had\) paramilitary flags at either end…now there’s no UDA flags*.” Another stated, “ *when the community takes a hold of something like that \(…\) they re\-claim \(it\)*.”  What these testimonies show is the photobook’s clear impact in building the confidence of the women involved, in giving them the freedom and courage to address matters of local political importance. **Also \(I3\)** 

  

 **Baker’s** and **Mairs Dyer’s** projects are experiments in dialogically meaningful and impactful co\-creation, of reciprocal learning that aims at a genuinely democratic exchange between the academy and the civic culture\(s\) within which it is situated. As Co\-director of the *Left Bloc Irish Media Collective* **\(C8\)** says: *“To be sure, there is often a degree of cynicism concerning the way academics engage with groups that are determined ‘marginalized’, a worry that the former \(whether consciously or not\) will exploit the latter for their own ends, rather than seeing their working together as a transformative end in itself. The* Traditions in Transition *and* Women’s Vision from Across the Barricades *projects are distinctive, original and significant examples of transformative media activism in that they make no claims to speak for marginalized communities from a predetermined position of power or authority, but instead are about attuning the ear to the low murmur of exclusion experienced by such groups and then empowering them with a freedom to amplify their own voices within their own communities and beyond”.* 

 As the testimonies above make clear, those involved in *WVAB* and *Traditions in Transition* were never simply representationally shackled to some abstract expert academic discourse or somehow haughtily ventriloquized by their supposed intellectual superiors. Rather, they benefited purely and simply by way of their own media activism; that is, by collaboratively developing the communicative means to represent themselves in the most novel, immediate, meaningful, unmediated and authentic way possible.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at Essex has transformed the way Profusion Media Ltd undertakes digital marketing, leading to new revenue streams for Profusion and increased income for commercial clients. Essex data science research in event time models, feature engineering and machine learning was embedded within Profusion’s first product, the AI Marketer. This acted as a catalyst for Profusion's transformation from a ‘services\-only’ company to a hybrid ‘services and products’ company through the creation of a separate division. The application of Essex research to address the business challenges of Profusion’s customers has led to significant benefits: a major British home improvement retailer gained over GBP13M in 5 months; a luxury automotive company gained over GBP30M by December 2020.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Successful digital marketing requires an understanding of why customers may choose to purchase from companies at certain times and not others. Improving the estimating of future customer transaction value allows better allocation of budgets and supports informed financial and strategic decision making. Such tasks are referred to as Customer Lifetime Value \(CLV\) modelling. Marketing efforts are typically focused on retaining customers with a high potential lifetime spend and hence many companies now collect large data sets of customer purchasing behaviour in order to interpret purchasing patterns, make predictions, and target their marketing. To do this more efficiently, new data science methodologies are required. Collaboration between Essex and Profusion Media Ltd \(Profusion hereafter\) intensified from 2015 onwards resulted in the ESRC and Technology Strategy Board funding a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) between the University of Essex and Profusion \[ **G1**\]. 

 Medellin\-Gasque and Fridman Rojas integrated University of Essex research in specialised software that was utilised in large datasets on the marketing campaigns for clients of Profusion, leading to the development of their first product, the AI Marketer. The scalability was made possible by adapting the penalty optimisation approach \[ **R1**\]. This directly addressed the optimal frequency that clients should send marketing emails so that individual customers stay engaged with the brand. Timing between campaigns was determined using penalised survival models \[ **R2**\]. Using machine learning methodologies an algorithm was developed to enable a large retail customer of Profusion \(a British multinational, the largest home improvement retailer in Europe, with 1,300 stores in ten countries across Europe, and the third largest in the world\) to identify customers as being neutral, active, at risk of not interacting again with services within a certain duration \(churning\), or churned based on their frequency of purchase and the time elapsed since their last purchase. The research led to the development of an R package available for download on the CRAN website \[ **C1**\]. The model had a predictive accuracy of 91% for churned customers and it allowed for the smart targeting of inactive customers. 

 The AI Marketer was further developed by applying and implementing machine learning approaches and feature engineering developed at Essex \[ **R3, R4, R5**\]. Optimal tree ensembles \(OTE\) \[ **R3**\] exploit the observation that the predictive performance of a random forest ensemble is highly associated with the strength of individual trees and their diversity.  LASSO, random forest, optimal tree ensembles \(OTE\) \[ **R3**\], ensemble of a subset of k\-NN classifiers \[ **R4**\], new feature selection methods \[ **R5**\] and deep neural networks \(DNN\) were implemented. The response variable represented the value of all transactions in the future year and the feature space was computed from the past transaction data. No other information about the customer’s characteristics or the features of the coming year was used. We demonstrated that OTE and random forest outperformed DNN and LASSO modelling within the AI marketer.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Profusion is a UK\-based data science and marketing services consultancy company, which specialises in helping retailers, FMCGs, SMEs and financial services businesses to grow their businesses using the power of data science. Its clients include Kingfisher, Topps Tiles Screwfix, HSBC, and First Direct \[ **S1**\]. From 2014 Profusion worked together with Essex researchers ‘ *towards applying state of the art statistical techniques and machine learning methods to solve business problems’* CEO/Director of Science, Data & Innovation, Profusion \[ **S2**\]. Profusion goes on to note: ‘ *In retrospect, this was a very significant moment in Profusion’s history as a company. It marked the beginning of a transformation for Profusion from a company mainly focused on digital marketing services with a strong emphasis on email delivery towards the company that it is today in which data science, data engineering, data visualisation and data strategy are Profusion’s core offerings to the market*’ \[ **S2**\]. 

 **Improved marketing and business performance for Profusion clients** 

 Profusion applied Essex research to address the real world business challenges faced by its customers \[ **S3**\]. The CEO/Director of Science, Data & Innovation at Profusion testifies that Essex research was ‘ *very beneficial to the successful delivery of projects for Profusion’s clients*’ \[ **S2**\]. Profusion worked with a leading DIY retailer on a project which addressed a need to predict customer churn, i.e. when a customer might stop making any further purchase \[ **S2, S3**\]. Profusion notes: *‘Essex’s mathematical sciences research \[ **R1**\] was applied to develop a sophisticated customer churn model with a predictive accuracy of 91% for churned customers. This enabled the firm to predict which of their customers were most at risk of churning and design a win back email campaign to retain as many customers as possible. **This generated approximately £4 million from previously inactive customers who were at risk of becoming permanently churned in the first month of using the algorithm**. Subsequently, this number **rose to an uplift of £13 million in the first 5 months and which was reflected by 76,264 inactive customers shifting to being active**.’* \[ **S2, S3**\]. 

 One of Profusion’s customers, a leading bank, wanted to determine the optimal frequency of sending their marketing emails to increase customer engagement \[ **S3**\]. Profusion state that this was *‘accomplished in collaboration with researchers at Essex by adapting the penalty optimisation approach to enable the scalability of Penalised Regression with Individual Deviance Effects as proposed in \[ **R2**\]. The approach had **good results improving the open rates and dwell time of the email marketing communications**’* \[ **S2**\] *.* This work led to **a member of Profusion’s Data Science team winning the Data Scientist/Big Data Leader category at the data IQ Talent Awards 2016** for the innovative application of these mathematical methods in a new business context \[ **S2, S4**\] **.** 

 Predicting customer behaviour can give a company the edge in a fierce and competitive market and Profusion worked with a luxury automotive company to design a model that could predict when its customers were likely to buy a new car. Research from \[ **R3**\] was ‘ *applied successfully to predict a window of opportunity for when different customers are most likely to be receptive to make a purchase. These insights were given to sales agents in different locations worldwide. **This has created an uplift of £30 million to date**’ \[ **S2, S3**\]. 

 Profusion worked with a global airline, to address their need to identify customers who were most likely to purchase a flight within the next three months, a challenging problem because of the complex and very large dataset. Profusion testifies that research from \[ **R5**\] ‘ *was used to discover the most important features to focus on to predict which customers were likely to fly’*. They add ‘ *This allowed the **project to be delivered well beyond the performance contractually agreed of 80% precision and recall, exceeding their expectations with 93% precision and 97% recall in identifying customers** that would go on to purchase a flight’* and conclude that ‘ *this project **provided Profusion with an initial contract worth £53k**’ \[ **S2**\]. 

 **AI Marketer and transformation of Profusion business** 

 In addition to the examples above, Essex research led Profusion to develop a new product, the AI Marketer. According to the Profusion CEO/Director of Science, Data & Innovation, this online platform ‘ *has within it some of the most successful statistical and machine learning methodologies we had learned to apply, including many methodologies directly inspired by research done at Essex such as \[ **R3, R4**\] to make customer lifetime value predictions or \[ **R1**\] for propensity to purchase*’ \[ **S2**\]. The AI Marketer was launched in 2020 and the University of Essex and Profusion were awarded a second KTP in July 2019 \[ **G2**\], to further develop the product \[ **S5**\]. The development of the AI Marketer product is an entirely new revenue stream for Profusion, who previously only focused on consultancy \(services rather than products\) \[ **S2**\]. \[text removed for publication\] The AI marketer enabled Profusion for example to win an important new retail client at a time when many retailers were suffering due to the pandemic. This **new contract is worth GBP70,000 of work initially, followed by annual recurring revenue of GBP20,000** for the continued use of the AI Marketer \[ **S2**\]. 

 **Expansion of Profusion’s data science capability and skills** 

 \[text removed for publication\] The development of a product function in the business with the AI Marketer also led to two direct new jobs being created, further jobs created as a result of partial redeployment of existing resources to support this \[ **S2**\] \[text removed for publication\]. Profusion CEO/Director of Science, Data & Innovation state: ‘ **Lausen and Perperoglou’s research increased the depth and breadth of Profusion’s Data Science team’s skills and knowledge directly** and **its application enabled the recruitment of new members**. Moreover, if it was not for the success of selling data science services, which benefited heavily from knowledge sharing and collaboration with the university, the Data Science team would not have grown to the extent which it has with **12 FTE jobs created since 2014**.’* \[ **S2**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Fiona Stafford enhanced the work of the Woodland Trust, Royal Forestry Society and other organisations, enriching understanding of the cultural importance of trees in the history of the British Isles and advancing present\-day conservation and new planting. Through authorship and promotion of the Charter for Trees, Woods and People she improved UK environmental policy\-delivery at national and local level, increasing institutional and individual engagement with planting and preservation. Her exemplary work of New Nature Writing, *The Long Long Life of Trees,* informed 2019 Pulitzer\-prize winning novel *The Overstory*. *The Brief Life of Flowers* inspired ‘literary garden’ design at Oxford Botanic Garden. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research brings literary criticism, history, ecology, art history, plant sciences and politics to bear on the study of trees. The principal underpinning publication is *The Long, Long Life of Trees* \( *LLLT*\) \[3.i\], which brings a cross\-disciplinary view to its subject and addresses an audience beyond academia. Stafford’s first book\-length endeavour in New Nature Writing, it interweaves individual emotional and imaginative responses to actual trees with a practical response to contemporary ecological threats. Paying ‘lyrical tribute’ to the diversity and beauty of trees, their special characteristics, uses, and ‘ever\-evolving’ meanings, it examines past and contemporary conservation challenges: tree diseases, environmental loss, and the role of trees in helping to counter climate change. Stafford reveals pressures on particular species as well as general threats to woodlands: the extraordinary longevity of the yew, for example \(the Ankerwycke Yew bore witness to Magna Carta\), once threatened by harvesting of timber for long\-bows, faced renewed threats after 1992 when Taxol – extracted from bark and needles – was found to have powerful anti\-carcinogenic properties. *The Brief Life of Flowers* \[3.ii\] is a companion text, unpacking the cultural, social and medicinal history of flowers including bluebells, daisies, foxgloves, poppies, and ghost orchids. 

 Several academic articles articulate the critical\-theoretical methodology. ‘Memory, Imagination and the Renovating Power of Trees’ \[3.iii\] argues for a new kind of dendrocriticism attentive to physical arboreal facts as well as literary/artistic representations. ‘The Roar of the Solway’ \[3.iv\] offers a novel literary\-critical approach to nature writing, grounding texts from Ruskin to Ciaran Carson in a shared, fully realised place: the Solway Firth as ‘a border between England and Scotland, opening towards the Isle of Man, Ireland, Wales’ and beyond. 

 These cross\-over publications, read within and beyond academia, build on Stafford’s expertise as a scholar of Romantic poetry, with interests in nature writing and writing place. She has written extensively about the history of literary responses to the natural environment. Relevant work includes the monograph *Local Attachments* \(2010\) \[3.v\], identifying and examining a Romantic\-period shift toward viewing local specificity as a strength rather than a limitation of poetry: close readings of Heaney, Burns, Wordsworth and others demonstrated the development of a perception that the local contains the universal. The larger implications of local environment were further explored in Stafford’s critical edition of a canonical text of Romanticism, Wordsworth and Coleridge’s *Lyrical Ballads* \(2013\) \[3.vi\]. Her introduction and notes elucidated the relationship between first\-hand experience and literary traditions such as Aesop’s poetic dialogues, the Virgilian *Eclogues*, and subsequent adaptations. Stafford has contributed to *Archipelago*, a literary journal of place and nature, and is currently editing an anthology of the magazine.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Stafford’s exploration of close connections between physical characteristics of tree types and their cultural associations has **encouraged public involvement in woodland conservation and tree planting**. The Woodland Trust’s Tree Charter Project Lead acknowledges her **‘pivotal role in … defining and communicating’ a new Charter for Trees, Woods and People**, 800 years after the Carta Foresta re\-established free men’s access to royal forests \(5.1\). Public interest was raised by Stafford’s 15 BBC Radio 3 programmes on *The Meaning of Trees*, 2012\-17, based on *LLLT* research \(5.2.i\). Recognizing the value of the programmes’ approach, the Trust appointed her in June 2017 to write the charter \(5.1\). Stafford worked closely with Trust management, creating the wording—drawing on her own expertise, a text analysis of the Tree Story Project \(60,000 members of the public articulated how trees and woods enhance their lives\), and consultation with representatives of 70\+ cross\-sector organisations and 130,000 people. Her achievement was to **capture common goals between often disparate groups:** conservationists, commercial wood managers \(e.g. Forestry Commission, Royal Forestry Society\) and mixed\-interest organisations \(e.g. Church of England, National Trust, National Farmers’ Union\). Stafford gave numerous talks, **making the case for shared interests in conservation, disease prevention and halting spread of pathogens** \(e.g. Institute for Chartered Foresters, 300 attendees; National Association of Local Councils, 150\) \(5.2.ii\). GreenBlue Urban, a sustainable cities consultancy, praised her ‘eloquen\[t\], … at points poignan\[t\]’ **articulation of a political way forward**: ‘the combination of narrative to create a sense of place and community’ and accessible expertise ‘will help us to win the argument for increased canopy cover on a global scale’ \(5.3\). The final Charter text, distilling 10 principles that define and protect the place of Trees in Britain, acknowledges Stafford’s authorship \(5.4\). 

 Publication of *LLLT* in mid\-2016 assisted engagement with the Charter’s development and enactment, the Project Lead reports, ‘ **rais\[ing\] the profile of trees and their associations** **with … culture and history’** \(5.1\). At July 2019 *LLLT* has sold 23,378 copies \(25,521 copies, December 2020\) \(profit undisclosed; cover\-price equivalent, GBP318,000.\) The editor recognises ‘a break out book for Yale University Press’, ‘ **an anchor for further books in … cultural history and nature writing’;** it ‘ **changed the perceptions of booksellers and buyers towards \[the press\]**’, showing ‘that we could \[have\] broad commercial appeal’ \(5.5\). 17 UK book\-talks **encouraged local uptake:** Stafford worked with The Reading Agency, a reading promotion charity, **inspiring regional libraries** to create displays centred on *LLLT* and visiting the winner, Hartlepool \(photographic evidence, 5.2.iii\). 

 The Charter officially launched at Lincoln Cathedral and Castle on 6 November 2018. The National Association of Local Councils applauded **the first ‘clear, unifying statement about the rights of people in the UK to the benefits of trees, woods and forests’** \(5.6\). Stafford encouraged institutional and personal engagement with the principles through linked events including a talk for the Sylva Foundation environmental charity \(attendance c. 150\) and British Library conversation with a legal sustainability expert \(5.2.ii\). **11 oak Charter Poles, carved by sculptor Simon Clements, were erected across the British Isles**, providing **durable expression of the principles** \(one per pole, a chief pole at Lincoln\). From 2018 Stafford served as Woodland Trust Special Advisor **assisting delivery of the Charter’s objectives** through \(e.g.\) an annual Tree Charter Day engaging communities, schools, businesses, families with planting and education \(5.1.ii, 5.4—‘Legacy’ page\). Commissioned radio programmes and interviews in the UK, Ireland and USA **maintained the prominence of the conservation message**. **By March 2020, individual signatures stood at 144,413**; **639 Charter Branches \(community groups\)** operated across the country committed to delivering the principles \(5.4\). **Local practices have started to replicate the old tradition of meeting at trees** \(photographic evidence, 5.7\). The Woodland Trust and partner organisations honoured a commitment to plant a tree marking each signature, with **114,000 trees planted** by the end of the 2018\-19 planting cycle \(5.2.iii and 5.8\). Assisting local involvement, Stafford wrote articles for the Trust’s newspaper *Leaf\!*, distributed to schools, leisure centres and community centres \(print run 10,000, readership 80,000\-90,000\) \(5.2.iv\). Numerous **councils have incorporated the Charter in biodiversity planning and communications** \(indicatively, Cam Parish, City of Edinburgh, and Wolverhampton Councils\) \(5.9.i\-iii\). The **Northern Forest Scheme** reforesting large areas around Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, and Hull \( **GBP5,700,000 government funding\) acknowledged that it was ‘Inspired by \[…\] the Tree Charter’** \(5.9.iv\-v\). 



 Map showing Charter Branch locations across the UK \(5.8\) 

 In the wake of the Charter Stafford’s ongoing collaborations with biologists and arborealists have **validated incorporation of the emotional significance of trees \(hitherto under\-acknowledged by scientific studies\) into conservation agendas**. The Sylva Foundation Chief Executive credits her with **assisting this environmental charity in ‘convey\[ing\] complex ideas and messages to stakeholders, ranging from woodland owners and professional foresters to members of the public**’ \(5.10.i\); she is ‘transforming hearts and minds’ through literature’s ‘capacity to translate difficult concepts, not only into palatable ideas, but into engaging stories’ \(5.10.i\). Through *LLLT* itself and close involvement in subsequent cross\-constituency conversations \(e.g. co\-organiser, ‘Trees and Wellbeing’ conference, June 2018; keynote lecturer for ArtdotEarth and the Royal Forestry Society conference, June 2019—respectively 130 and 229 delegates from forestry, conservation and creative sectors\) she has 'set the framework for discussion’ \(RFS Chief Executive\): ‘Using examples of how poets and artists … have captured the value of trees beyond the utilitarian, she was able to illustrate how the emotions that trees provoke \[are\] deeply rooted in human experience. … It was clear that forestry is not the preserve of STEM disciplines and that cross pollination … with other disciplines is hugely valuable’ \(5.10.ii\). Her RFS lecture was published in a general\-audience interdisciplinary art book, *Evolving the Forest* \(2020\) \(5.10.iii\). 

  

 Writer Richard Powers credited *LLLT*’s ‘attention to the literary and cultural meaning that humans have assigned \[trees\] throughout history with ’ **inform\[ing\]’ his best\-selling work of New Nature Writing, **The** **Overstory** \(5.11\). A German reader of *LLLT* was ‘inspir\[ed\]’ to start a Dresden Treetrail project, creating an urban tree trail and integrating it into English as a second language teaching exercise for ‘students of horticulture, environmental monitoring and landscape planning \(also … business and IT students on demand\)’ \(5.12\). An Oxford Botanic Garden lecture on trees \(March 2020, 230 attendees\) led to **development of a ‘literary garden’,** using *A Brief Life of Flowers* as guidance \(5.13.i\). The garden was seen by 178,344 visitors in its first year \(to Dec 2019\) \(5.13.ii\).

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Fenton and Neil founded Agena Ltd in 1998 based on their research on Bayesian Networks \(BNs\). Its software, AgenaRisk, incorporates their algorithms and has gained over 4,500 new users since 2014. The software combines data and expert knowledge to improve decision making and prediction for risk assessment. Thus, Fenton and Neil’s research has made BNs directly accessible to decision makers without advanced mathematical and statistical skills, and helped them to improve predictions and decision making in situations that are highly uncertain and where data is often limited. 

 AgenaRisk is being used to model and predict cybersecurity risk, in operational risk management, to evaluate the safety of medical devices and support medical decision making for trauma patients and to support planning and decision making in major developing world infrastructure, environment, and food resource projects. Fenton and Neil’s algorithms have also been used to develop a set of guidelines for lawyers and forensic scientists for efficiently processing pre\-trial evidence. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Typically, most mathematical approaches to risk assessment and decision analysis are not appropriate in circumstances where there is uncertainty, such as catastrophic banking failures or terrorist attacks. This is because they require ‘big’ data and rely on assumptions that are typically made in statistical analysis. Moreover, even for common risks with extensive historical data, for example, in medicine, law and finance, crucial information about causal and explanatory factors is typically missing, even though it is known to subject matter experts. Conventional mathematical and statistical approaches do not work in these situations and Bayesian Networks \(BNs\) can address these problems. However, most work in BNs involves ‘machine learning’, where it is assumed that causal structures and relationships can only be learnt from data.  For risk assessment, even of highly constrained problems, with small numbers of variables, the machine learning approach is only viable when very large volumes of data are available and the majority of relevant relationships are observable.  In other words, when BNs are typically ‘learnt from data’ the causal mechanisms underlying the problem are poorly identified, and so provide little new insight or make inferences that are difficult to explain. 

 Queen Mary Profs. Fenton and Neil have developed a range of novel elicitation and modelling techniques that make it much easier for subject experts who are not trained in Bayesian methods or statistics to build and use models. This includes breakthrough work on tailoring BN idioms \[3.1\], which provide common templates for building BNs to particular subject areas \[3.2\]; ranked nodes ‎\[3.3\], which significantly reduce the burden on defining probability tables required for BN models; and making the most of messy and incomplete data ‎\[3.4\]. They have also developed an alternative ‘smart data’ approach that combines data with expert knowledge to produce causal BN models. This research has been incorporated into the software system, AgenaRisk \[3.5\], commercialised by the company Agena Ltd. Agena Ltd was founded by Fenton and Neil in 1998. Since, in practice, it is often very difficult for decision makers to directly use BN algorithms, a focus of Fenton and Neil’s research has been on maximising the usability of the approach and software, ie making sophisticated probabilistic modelling accessible to non\-statisticians. 

 Since 2014, Agena Ltd have used Fenton and Neil’s research to develop a significant new ‘learning’ component in the AgenaRisk desktop software, which enables users both to automatically learn all Bayesian network parameters from data, even if the data are incomplete, and also easily incorporate expert knowledge. The underlying philosophy has also led to a methodology for a\) measuring and predicting resilience and vulnerability in complex systems such as banking and b\) modelling and evaluating sensor technologies in real world settings such as psychology, privacy and the law. 

 Fenton and Neil have also developed a breakthrough dynamic discretisation algorithm \[3.6\], which enables modellers to use continuous variables alongside discrete ones without going through the time consuming and intrinsically inaccurate process of static discretisation. This enables a broader class of risk assessment problems to be solved with much greater accuracy. Their binary factorisation algorithm \[3.7\] enables much larger models with continuous variables to be computed. As a result, Agena Ltd have developed new functions in the AgenaRisk desktop software to compute a\) hybrid influence diagrams, and b\) value of information. These two important new tools used Fenton and Neil’s published papers \[3.6\] \[3.3\] \[3.7\] describing the necessary algorithms. While there are several other tools that compute influence diagrams and values of information, AgenaRisk is the only one that can do this accurately for hybrid models \(ie those with both discrete and continuous variables\).

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 AgenaRisk is now in use by organisations to support risk assessments. Typical benefits to users are solving safety and reliability problems, solving cost benefit problems and satisfying regulators. Since 2014, AgenaRisk has added over 4,500 registered users, including several hundred commercial users with paid licences \[5.1, 5.2\]. Over 70% of Agena Ltd’s income is from organisations outside the UK. 

#  Evaluating the safety of medical devices 

 The world’s largest medical devices company Medtronic has 40 licences of AgenaRisk, which are used in evaluating safety of devices, as well as for project decision making. Since 2015, Medtronic has used AgenaRisk to model SureValve \(used in heart failure management\) and PlasmaBlade \(used in surgery\) for single use or mission reliability. It has also used AgenaRisk to model the probability of patient harm due to issues with an Accelerometer used in Micra and LinQ pacemakers. This enabled a timely and successful launch for the Micra device, which was recognised by US News and World Report as Medical Product of the Year for 2016. Eric Maas, senior Director at Medtronic, has said that the deterministic modelling that Medtronic engineers use does not adequately address the “manufacturing variations, variations in patient anatomy, variations in usage by medical personnel, and variation in the environment of use,” which are not directly controlled by development engineers. Thus, the modelling needs to be “augmented with a probabilistic or stochastic modelling approach. AgenaRisk not only provides such a tool – it enables the engineers to THINK probabilistically. It allows them to visualise the variations in use conditions and optimise the design of our medical devices so as to maximize the probability of successful medical applications and minimise the likelihood of harmful actions *”* \[5.3\]. 

#  Supporting clinical decision making 

 In partnership with trauma surgeons at the Royal London Hospital, one of the busiest trauma centres in Europe, Profs. Fenton and Neil have developed two clinical decision support \(CDS\) tools to construct “causal networks” that reproduce the reasoning pathways that clinicians use when working out if a patient is likely to be at risk of a particular condition or outcome \[5.4\]. The first tool has been shown to be as accurate as specialised blood tests for coagulation, but in a way that obviates the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment. This allows the clinical team to offer damage control resuscitation to patients who need such treatment, and spare patients who do not need it from the potential side effects of this treatment. Similarly, the Limb Salvage CDS tool is designed to help doctors make decisions about how to save an injured patient’s limb\(s\). Nigel Tai, consultant Trauma & Vascular Surgeon at the Royal London hospital confirms, “these decision\-support tools, designed to meet the needs of time\-poor clinical decision\-makers working under pressure, will improve patient care – especially so in under\-resourced settings where sophisticated laboratory kit or the absence of senior surgical support threatens optimal patient care” \[5.5\]. 

#  Informing Government decisions on an agriculture for nutrition strategies \[5.6, 5.7\] 

##  Kenya 

 In collaboration with Fenton and Neil, the ICRAF \(part of the World Agroforestry Centre in Kenya\) calculated costs and benefits of two alternative agricultural development project proposals over a period of 10 years to enable decision making. A group of subject experts defined the primary risk factors that could affect the outcomes of the projects. The projects benefit the local community by improving the quality of food and water supplies. They also have environmental benefits by decreasing the ecological footprint. One of these proposals had higher costs and uncertainty but could also lead to more benefits. The other project was a safer option requiring a smaller budget but its potential return was also smaller. Fenton and Neil built a model to calculate the costs and return on investment of the projects. 

##  Uganda 

 Uganda Vision 2040 provides development paths to operationalise Uganda’s Vision statement:  “A Transformed Ugandan Society from a Peasant to a Modern and Prosperous Country within 30 years” as approved by Cabinet in 2007. It aims to transform Uganda from a predominantly low\-income country to a competitive upper middle\-income country. The Vision 2040 agricultural and nutrition strategy addressed poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition in the country but lacked clarity about household nutrition. Therefore, Fenton and Neil used AgenaRisk to develop an impact model of the strategy. The strategy, among other objectives, sought to transform the country’s agricultural landscape from traditional systems to large\-scale commercial agriculture. Model results suggested that the strategy was likely to have negative outcomes for the rural livelihoods it intended to support with no appreciable influence on household hunger but, by influencing preferences for and access to quality nutritional foods, increased the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency. The results highlighted to the Government the trade\-offs to be negotiated to support decision making around agriculture for nutrition. 

#  Modelling and predicting cybersecurity risk 

 Five US and Indian technology companies are using AgenaRisk to model and predict cybersecurity risk. The international collaborative project BARD \[5.8\] \- funded by the US Intelligence and Research Agency \(IARPA\) \- used AgenaRisk across all its sites to tackle a variety of intelligence related problems. The companies considered problems where agents were presented with multiple pieces of evidence from different sources of varying accuracy, some of which could be contradictory. Fenton and Neil worked as consultants to develop intelligence related models and train users to build and run the models. Since the end of the project, Monash University, Australia has been using the AgenaRisk application programming interface \(API\) as a platform for its own web\-based intelligence modelling system. 

#  Developing tools and training for law and forensics 

 Fenton led the prestigious 6\-month Programme on Probability and Statistics in Forensic Science \(FOS\) at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences \(INI\), University of Cambridge, which was heavily focused on the use of BNs in law. The programme not only attracted the world’s leading legal and forensic scholars, but also attracted many high\-level judges, lawyers and decision makers. A significant output of the programme was a set of guidelines for lawyers and forensic scientists \[5.9\], which led to the decision by the International Criminal Court in the Hague to train all their judges and lawyers in the use of Bayesian methods to efficiently process pre\-trial evidence. In July 2017, Fenton was invited to provide the majority of the training. Fenton and Neil’s work is also cited as recommended reading in the new Guidelines for Advocates document produced by the Royal Statistical Society and the Inns of Court College of Advocacy \[5.10\]. Finally, Fenton and Neil have developed an on\-line tool, jointly with researchers at the Dutch Forensic Institute, which automatically generates the necessary BN models for forensic analysis of cases of linked crimes \[5.11\]. 

#  Assessing financial risk 

 AgenaRisk is used by eight of Milliman LLC’s \(the world’s largest independent international actuarial firm\) clients for operational risk management, risk tolerance and for other financial/insurance risk applications such as pricing and investment performance assessment \[5.12\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Developing technology to enable the non\-invasive early detection of cancers is one of today’s global challenges.  Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer globally and accounts for 900,000 deaths every year. Symptoms of bowel cancer are non\-specific making it challenging for GPs to detect. Many patients are sent to hospital for an invasive colonoscopy which is usually negative. There is a desperate need to improve primary care triage methods to ensure the correct patients are prioritised for treatment and unnecessary referrals avoided.  By the time many \(\~60%\) patients present with symptoms, it is often at an advanced stage.  Using a multi\-disciplinary approach, a research team led by Professor Peter Dunstan \(Physics Dept, Swansea University\) and colorectal surgeon Professor Dean Harris \(Swansea Bay University Health Board & Medical School, Swansea University\) have used spectroscopy and AI technology to develop a rapid blood\-based test effective in detecting early\-stage bowel cancer. On the back of this success and the significant potential of our technology platform for the early detection of other cancers, we have established CanSense Ltd, an award\-winning spin out company.  The company has advanced development of the diagnostic, identified and commenced on a clear route to market, championed public awareness and charity research support, and put patients at the forefront of our plans to detect cancer early when it is most treatable.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Peter Dunstan co\-leads a cutting edge Biospectroscopy research group together with clinician and consultant colorectal surgeon, Professor Dean Harris. The group represents a significant multidisciplinary initiative between Swansea University’s \(SU\) Physics Department and Medical School and utilises SU’s Centre for Nanohealth. 

 **Early research** 

 Dunstan’s developments in Raman spectroscopy, soft matter and analytics can be demonstrated from earlier work based upon the development of nanoscale sensors for intercellular pH measurement using surface enhanced Raman Spectroscopy \(SERS\) \[ **R1**\].  Using principal component analysis \(PCA\) a more reliable and robust methodology than peak ratiometrics was established to identify spectral changes. Subsequently Dunstan collaborated with clinician and consultant colorectal surgeon, Professor Dean Harris \(honorary clinical professor at the Medical School, SU\) on a funded pilot study of the analysis of serum from colorectal cancer \(CRC\) patients \[ **G1**\].  Based on the pilot study showing the ability to produce distinctive spectra from blood serum, the opportunities offered by SERS and PCA analytics, and knowing patient CRC outcomes, the group were successful in winning a competitive Cancer Research Wales grant \[ **G2**\].  The grant supported PhD researcher C. Jenkins and an initial evaluation article of Raman spectroscopy applied to cancer diagnostics, from surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy through to endoscopic approaches was published \[ **R2**\]. Extending our studies to SERS labelling of specific proteins were found to be subject to inconsistencies, complex assay development and inadequate performance.  A label\-free approach with serum was investigated using PCA analytics and it was found that with technical adaptions to sampling approaches the spectra demonstrated sensitivities to patient clinical outcomes in relation to colorectal cancer \[ **R3**\]. 

 **Identification of key spectral biomarkers for bowel cancer** 

 In recent years, interest in the field of liquid biopsies has grown, given they can be less invasive for patients.  Research by Dunstan et al. \[ **R3**\] thus developed a high throughput \(HT\) platform for Raman spectroscopy based around biofluids \(blood/serum samples\).  Laser molecule interactions produce a spectral output from a patient’s serum sample. These are generated on a modified Raman spectrometer with innovations in biofluid handling and high\-throughput capability for producing rapid and reproducible results.  This was combined with machine learning \(ML\) analytics to develop a label\-free platform for cancer diagnostics \[ **R4**, patent filed – at National Phase\]. The algorithms interrogate Raman spectral features identified as cancer\-specific amide, lipid and nucleic acid by\-products which dynamically change with cancer activity. 

 Critical to identifying key cancer biomarkers in the blood was establishing reliable measurement criteria and sampling consistency \- sample preparation and protocols formed a major part of this effort. In terms of analysis time, the HT platform takes only 10 minutes per sample and based on pilot dataset of serum from 30 patients with CRC and 30 matched controls, achieved a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 83% for detecting colorectal cancer \[ **R3**\]. The in\-house development of propriety data analytics and chemometric methods utilising high performance computing methods and bespoke analytic packages \(written in Mathematica, Matlab, Python and R\-programming language\) that incorporate patient outcome and machine learning has been a key factor in producing an early\-stage diagnostic technique that can impact upon healthcare provision. 

 Based on the outcomes from **R4**, funding has been won from the Welsh government \[ **G3**\] and Cancer Research Wales \[ **G4**\] to help extend the number and type of patient samples, and also to compare Raman with FIT \(faecal test\) in 800 primary care patients \[ **G5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

###   

 **Introduction** 

 We have founded an award\-winning spin\-out company, CanSense Ltd, that takes Raman spectroscopy as the base technology for application to rapid biomarker testing for early cancer detection via a blood test.  Its primary product is based around colorectal cancer \(CRC\) detection and relies on award winning research \[ **C1**\] by Harris and Dunstan in 2016. 

 **Clinical impact** 

 Our pilot work developing a CRC blood test has overcome previous limitations affecting Raman spectroscopy in clinical diagnostics using new sampling innovations on a modified research Raman microscope \(currently at TRL4\). The test has a clinical proof of concept with expanded patient training sets producing the **latest results,** showing **sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 91% for CRC** \[ **C2**\]. The cancer AI model also detects pre\-malignant polyps \(adenomas\) down to 2 mm size with 84.2% sensitivity and 89.5% specificity \[ **C2, C3**\]. 

 A high negative predictive value **\(NPV\) >98%** means that there is high confidence in the test ruling out cancer \(c.f. colonoscopy NPV 99.5%\).  Additionally, good patient acceptability was found when the test was employed within an academic study of primary care patients \(n=595\). \[ **C4, preprint**\]. The study introduced a mechanism for the introduction of the test directly into primary care as a triage tool for GP referrals and evidenced that it would be well received. The positive predictive value \( **PPV\) \(> 11.8%\)** offers GPs the opportunity to triage patients more effectively for referrals \(c.f. only 3% under current NICE guidelines for suspected cancer pathway referrals\), **potentially reducing colonoscopies by 49.8%** representing **significant NHS savings \~GBP418 per patient and \~GBP265,000,000** annually. 

 Our test's clinical potential has been guided by the company’s co\-founder Dean Harris, a practicing colorectal cancer surgeon and researcher. Trial patient testimonials include *“It has changed my life, to know to have a blood test which can prove very very quickly if the cancer has come back. This is incredible.""* \[Patient testimonial **, C5**\] 

 Our blood test has been endorsed by the National Cancer Clinical Director for Wales, Clinical Lead Transforming Cancer Services, Professor Tom Crosby OBE who said, *“Thousands of bowel cancer deaths could be prevented every year through earlier diagnosis of this disease. This is a potentially game changing innovation in terms of population\-based access to a cheap, convenient and acceptable test. This innovative test will mean subjecting less patients to invasive endoscopic examinations. This is an important step in the development of precision medicine undertaking the right test for the right patient at the right time.”* \[ **C6, page 10**\]. 

 CanSense Ltd now has access to more than 1300 patients which have been recruited through this network and current on\-going trials will considerably increase this number. NHS services and trained personnel including GPs are also impacted as they help the trial recruit patients, and then process, store and record all samples prior to transfer into our laboratory. 

 *“You can say to \(the patient\) there’s a 98% chance it’s not going to be cancer, how relieving is that. It would be a huge weight off his mind and reduce a lot of patient anxiety*” \[GP testimonial *,* **C5**\] and *“Being Timely, if the blood test is normal, you can get on with your rest of your life\!”* \[GP testimonial, **C5**\]. 

 We have already witnessed greater patient acceptance of a blood test rather than the usual unpleasant, poor compliance screening techniques \(faecal sample/ colonoscopy\), as clearly identified in the first mixed methods clinical evaluation study which evaluated test performance and patient acceptability via focus group interviews \[ **C4**\].  Further trials which continue to expand evidence on this are underway. 

 A new national clinical trial called Combined Raman and FIT \(CRaFT\) commenced in 2018 with the goal of recruiting 800 participants. The trial now has participating GPs from at least 4 Welsh health boards across South Wales and one English health board. This trial will inform on Raman performance compared to current faecal testing \(FIT\) and reports in the next 12 months. 

 **Formation in 2018 of an Award\-Winning spin\-out company \- CanSense Ltd** 

 As a vehicle to achieve wider immediate translation of the diagnostic technology a spin\-out company, CanSense Ltd \[ **C5**\], was registered in 2018.  CanSense is working in partnership with SU and Swansea Bay University Health Board to clinically develop the technique to detect cancer early. Along with the researchers \(Dunstan, Harris, Jenkins\), a share\-holding CEO with over 20 years’ finance experience was appointed in 2018, along with 5 advisory board members \(ranging from specialised healthcare consultants to a patient involvement consultant\). CanSense leveraged ongoing clinical trials in 2020 \(>35 primary care practices participating\) and has recruited 4 secondary care champions to influence stakeholders in health boards and ensure wide scale clinical interest, adoption and procurement in various Welsh regions. Since 2019, 3 Pharmaceutical companies \(under NDA\) have expressed an interest for their trials of oncology therapeutics as a test for minimal residual disease detection. CanSense is a business\-to\-business service provider with a direct fee\-for\-service model through a centralised processing laboratory.  Given the need for timely primary care decision\-making in line with the Single Cancer Pathway we have modelled returning the result to the GP within 48 hours. 

 The company collaborates with the University and the charity funders Cancer Research Wales \(CRW\).  CRW’s strong endorsement of the activities of CanSense are provided in a letter of support \[ **C7**\], which includes the following quote: 

 ‘*Importantly, the greatest accolades have come from the end\-users themselves, patients, GPs and the Wales Cancer Network. Those patients who were involved in the trials for the Raman blood test are unanimous in their agreement that this blood test, even at the early pre\-clinical stage is a welcomed and a much\-needed novel intervention that can transform how, and the speed at which, bowel cancers are diagnosed”.* 

 The company and its founders support bowel cancer awareness and the CRW charity champions to promote fund raising and awareness of the impact of the charity’s funding of research \[ **C8**\].  This has led to a one\-hour BBC Radio Wales programme which featured the blood test \[ **C9**\] and wider dissemination through public talks and workshops. 

 **Innovation Funding** 

 At present the company has had innovation funding in excess of GBP250,000 since 2019. A proportion of this funding came from winning competitive catalyst/accelerator programs including: 

-  BioCity Oxford *Launch program 2020*, GBP50,000 in\-kind funding and Venture Capital potential, GBP50,000 convertible note \[ **C10**\] 

-  ICURE Midlands participant funding, GBP32,114 \[ **C10**\] 

-  BioCity/Oxford AHSN *Accelerator program*, 2019, in\-kind funding GBP25,000 \[ **C10**\] 

-  University of Southampton Science park *Catalyst* and *Catalyst \+* *programs 2019/2020*, in\-kind funding GBP15,000 \[ **C10**\] 

 **Awards** 

 CanSense has won a number of key awards since its inception, namely: 

 South Coast tech awards, best start up and best innovative tech company, winner 2020 \[ **C11**\] 

 Empact Ventures\-Super Connect for Good: Regional winner, 3<sup>rd</sup> place nationally, 2020 \[ **C11**\] 

 MediWales: Best Innovation winner 2020 & Best Start\-up winner 2019 \[ **C11**\] 

 MediLink – Start\-up award \- CanSense Highly Commended 2020 \[ **C11**\] 

 CanSense has interviewed over 200 customers \(clinical commissioning groups, GPs, pharmaceuticals, diagnostic companies\) thereby validating our business plan and identifying our early adopters as pharmaceutical clinical trials and private/public primary healthcare providers. CanSense is focussed on the product’s clinical development for CE/UKCA marking and NICE approval. 

 The Coronavirus pandemic has undoubtedly affected our company journey in the past 12 months, as trial recruitment was suspended, and diagnostic clinical development impacted.  This period has however highlighted the urgent need for rapid and early cancer diagnostics based around non\-invasive procedures, and how diagnostic triage tools can reduce unnecessary referrals into secondary care. Due diligence is being conducted by several investors at time of writing \(December 2020\) and we await the outcomes of two impactful NIHR awards \(AI: GBP1,400,000 and i4i PDA: GBP1,100,000\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Centenary of WW1 2014\-19 represented an opportunity for researchers to change and broaden public perceptions of the conflict’s history. Sharp used her research into women’s anti\-war activism in Germany and Britain to counterbalance the battle\-centric and thus male\-centred approach that characterised the planned commemorations. The only researcher working on German resistance to WW1 during the period, she co\-founded a national Peace History Working Group to amplify and internationalise peace narratives and bring marginalised stories to the public’s attention. 

 Her work has: 

-  raised the public profile of the anti\-war narrative during the centenary; 

-  centred women’s anti\-war activism, raising public awareness of the range of positions taken by women; 

-  inspired local history and community groups to explore anti\-war activism; 

-  changed public understanding of and attitudes to German resistance to war; 

-  changed the practice of external partners from the peace activist and engaged arts communities.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Sharp’s research locates and amplifies marginalized and hidden voices, especially those of political women and anti\-war activists. Much of her work on WW1 and its aftermath focuses on rebalancing scholarly narratives to take account of the experience of defeated nations and to make the resistance within these nations visible. She argues that including these voices does not simply add to our historical understanding, it fundamentally changes it. 

 Based on archival research conducted between 2004 and 2019, Sharp is sole or co\-author of a substantial body of academic publications on women’s organised response to WW1 and its aftermath within and beyond Germany. Since 2005, Sharp has attracted RCUK funding to consolidate links between and coordinate the activities of an international network of feminist WW1 scholars, and this is reflected in her co\-edited and co\-authored publications **\[1**\- **4\]**. 

 Her 2007 co\-edited volume **\[1\]** was the first in a series of distinctive comparative works that make Central and Eastern European scholarship accessible to Anglophone readerships through collaboration and co\-authorship. It examines women’s war activism from 1914 to 1919, with the tight time\-frame allowing international commonalities and differences to emerge. A second volume in 2011 **\[2\]** extended the sphere of investigation to women’s hitherto under\-researched transnational activism and organisation in the immediate aftermath of WW1, while a third in 2017 **\[3\]** explored women’s war activism thematically in chapters co\-authored by international teams. 

 Sharp also co\-authored three Special Issues in 2007, 2016 and 2018, of which **\[4\]** reflects on the centenary from an international gender history perspective, finding a common pattern of neglect of women’s wartime experiences in most European nations, countered by members of Sharp’s feminist scholar network intervening in public narratives **\[1\-4\]**. 

 Based on ongoing archival research into the German revolution of 1918, **\[5\]** is one of the first scholarly articles to make women visible as revolutionary political agents and place them at the centre of the narrative. This moves us beyond the stalemate of historical interpretations based on a very narrow view of the revolution in terms of time, space and sphere of action. It places the events of October \- November 1918 within a broader revolutionary cultural context, arguing that without the participation of women in widespread industrial unrest and anti\-war protest from early 1915, the revolution could not have spread. 

 Comparing feminist anti\-war activism during WW1 with the principles and implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 \(2000\), **\[6\]** examines the legacy of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, founded during WW1 and still active as an NGO today. Together with a cultural history of peace \(1815\-1920\) published in March 2020, this work challenges the periodisation that uses war and conflict as the dominant framework for interpreting the past. Focussing instead on developments conducive to fostering sustainable peace such as campaigns for social and gender justice, food security, public health and democracy allows the underlying continuities in these areas to emerge and radically changes our perspective. Sharp’s push to include dissenting and diverse voices in the historical narratives around WW1 is essential to counter persistent claims of national enthusiasm for war in either Britain or Germany. 

 Sharp’s research into marginal voices and scholarship is ongoing, with three further publications forthcoming and a book contract on international revolutionary women with Bloomsbury for submission in 2021.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Sharp noted that dissenting voices and German perspectives, particularly women’s anti\-war activism, were being overlooked in the UK’s WW1 centenary commemorations, and sought to embed them into the public narrative. The main beneficiaries were Sharp’s external partners from the peace history and activist community, the creative and heritage industries as well as theatre, conference and exhibition audiences and MOOC learners. 

 **\(i\) Peace History and Activism:** **amplifying and internationalising anti\-war voices.** 

 Sharp worked closely with leading activists within the peace community, sharing her knowledge of German anti\-war resistance and women’s role within it and inspiring others to make their own contributions to peace history awareness. This work was informed by her study of the historical roots of contemporary peace organisations and the many continuities that help us understand and measure the effectiveness of anti\-war campaigns over time. 

 The reach and resonance of Sharp’s research is reflected in the unusually high number of national and international invitations to contribute to commemorative events beyond the academy, including some high profile international events such as the German Foreign Office \(December 2014\), the Kiel Maritime Museum \(March 2016\), the Kansas National WW1 Museum, America’s official WW1 museum and memorial \(October 2017\), the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom centenary conference in Zurich \(May 2019\), and the Tshisimani Centre for Activist Education, South Africa **\[I\]**. 

 Between 2014 and 2019, Sharp’s public\-facing activities included 53 related talks, interviews, podcasts and lectures locally, nationally and internationally as well as published articles for a wider readership **\[I\]**. The scale and scope of the interventions show that Sharp’s ongoing and sustained efforts to link her historical research to present\-day anti\-war and gender activism resonated strongly with the public. In 2016, she organised two public\-facing international peace history conferences in Leeds in 2016 \(300 delegates from activist and academic communities\), that took a comparative approach across several countries to questions of gender and peace history. 

 In 2014, Sharp co\-founded the national Peace History working group, which brought activists and academics together to coordinate and amplify peace history efforts during the centenary. She worked in particular with the Convenor of the Peace History working group and Peace History Conferences at the Imperial War Museum, who is also a member of the First World War Peace Forum, and a Vice\-President of the international peace society Pax Christi. For this person Sharp’s work ‘brought an otherwise missing dimension’ to their events, and made it ‘impossible to consider planning a WW1 “peace history” event that did not examine the German experience’ **\[A\]**. She felt that Sharp’s inclusive approach ‘made a real difference, helping to bridge the gap between academics and campaigners’ and thus challenging entrenched hierarchies of knowledge. In particular, it stimulated local groups ‘to research the history of opposition to the war in their area, to create exhibitions and local events of their own to mark the centenary – and to make sure the experience of women was included’ **\[A\]**. 

 **\(ii\) **Women of Aktion:** play and exhibition** 

 **Changed Practice** 

 Sharp worked collaboratively over 18 months with partners Bent Architect Theatre Company \(BA\), on the *Women of Aktion* theatre project, focused on the Kiel Uprising **\[E\]**. BA is a socially engaged theatre company with a commitment to bringing lesser known historical stories to the contemporary stage which brings cultural value to Bradford, a culturally diverse city with a high proportion of economically deprived citizens. Sharp’s research and translations of primary sources in German allowed BA to create a historically accurate and ethically justifiable portrayal of the protagonists, which spoke powerfully to the audience’s emotions and sense of justice. BA attest that their experience of working with Sharp caused a shift from highly localised, site\-specific projects to a more ambitious national and international approach. ‘It is the first time we have toured abroad’ and ‘we reached new and wider audiences with untold history’ **\[D\]**. Sharp’s input enabled a more nuanced, layered historical understanding and gave BA access to German\-language materials. ‘It’s really brought us on professionally, I think it’s really changed the way that we will work from now on’ **\[C\]** ‘and opened up a whole new working methodology for us’ **\[D\]**. 

 **Changed Understanding** 

 The play has won critical accolades as a piece of theatre \( **\[H/i\]** ‘What’s on Stage Top Pick’ 30.10.2019\) that was ‘powerful, funny and taught me loads\!’ **\[H/iii\]** and successfully ‘sneaks research into an engaging and entertaining show.’ **\[H/iii\]** It toured in theatres in the UK and Germany, with 17 performances reaching a total audience of 1,000. Audience responses recorded on film **\[C\]** and social media show empathy with the characters’ suffering, admiration for the women and surprise, even anger, that these powerful stories had been suppressed **\[H/iii\]**. This was especially important in the German city of Kiel, where the city’s role in the revolution has historically been forgotten or considered shameful **\[F\]** and the commemoration privileged male accounts while erasing women’s history. One viewer commented: ‘The actors play their roles with such appealing energy that you can’t help sharing their outrage at being left out of the history of the revolution.’ **\[H/iii\]** 

 Sharp also worked with the Chair of the Bradford Peace Museum to produce an exhibition entitled *Women of Aktion* informed by her research insights into women’s contribution to the Kiel Uprising of November 1918. The exhibition has so far been displayed at the Bradford Peace Museum, a pop\-up shop in Bradford city centre, MShed Bristol, Manchester Central Library, Manchester Working Class Library, Leeds City Museum, Glasgow Women’s Library and Richmond Barracks, Dublin, mostly accompanied by public talks. Commenting on the Bradford iteration, the Museum Chair noted that ‘For a largely British audience, used to a male, military, patriotic and establishment analysis of that time, it was revelatory to engage with narrative and critique that were female, civilian, German and revolutionary’ and that Sharp’s input had ‘changed the historical understanding and perception of all who engaged with it’ **\[B\]**. Responses elsewhere have included emotional engagement and identification with the revolutionary women: ‘\[t\]he rallying call of revolutionary German foremothers echoes down the century’ **\[H/iv\]** \(Tweet 30/08/2019\). 

 Further plans to exhibit as part of the Newington Green Revolutionary Ideas since 1708 festival  in April\-May 2020 were interrupted by COVID\-19. The project has an accessible database **\[G\]** that offers a template for academics wanting to work effectively with creative partners, reflections on the project and teaching materials including mini\-lectures, worksheets and summaries for schools and colleges wishing to follow up on topics raised by the project. 

 **\(iii\) MOOC: **Changing Faces of Heroism 

 Sharp led the Leeds bid to work in partnership with the BBC, culminating in the BBC/Futurelearn MOOC ‘Changing Faces of Heroism’/’Heroism through Art and Culture’. This reached a global audience \(39,172 participants from all inhabited continents registered from October 2014 to December 2018\) and attracted highly positive evaluations and 22,550 unique participant comments, 2,344 specifically on Germany **\[J\]**. Sharp’s transnational anti\-war activism research was prominent in the course, challenging dominant attitudes to heroism coded as masculine and nationalist. 

 Participants’ comments and engagement reveal that they thought more comparatively and critically about a wider range of heroic figures, including women, war resisters and German nationals as the course progressed. E.g. ‘Where have I been all this time\! I have been giving the women who took part in the war very little consideration and got swept along with the attention given to the men’ **\[J\]** \(comment ID 2555400\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Atomic Weapons Establishment \(AWE\) is responsible for maintaining the UK’s Continuous at Sea Deterrent in the age of the comprehensive test ban treaty. That responsibility requires the ability to assess and evaluate with extreme confidence the condition of highly complex assemblies comprising multiple and exotic materials. Research at Heriot\-Watt University \(HWU\) has developed key relevant optical, non\-destructive in\-situ inspection techniques to provide essential physical and chemical data, within complex and costly engineering trials and long\-term materials ageing experiments. AWE deploy HWU’s technologies to provide invaluable and previously unobtainable key information that AWE uses in its critical role supporting the defence and security of the UK. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Common to all of AWE’s needs is the ability to monitor conditions in extremely hazardous \(ionizing\) and space\-constrained environments, often where the capacity to monitor these conditions over long periods was not part of the original design. These measurements are essential to determine component health over decades of use, maintenance, and storage and must be achieved without intervention. This imposes extreme requirements on sensor configuration, reliability and longevity and is exacerbated by very limited permitted changes to the engineered environment. Heriot\-Watt researchers have successfully addressed these challenges by developing optical sensing solutions uniquely configured for this demanding application. 

 Heriot\-Watt research enables key areas of interest to AWE, including i\) Gap and shape sensing \[3.1, 3.2\], ii\) Gas sensing \[3.3, 3.4\] and iii\) System Integration \[3.5, 3.6\]. 

 **Gap sensing** using fibre optic based interferometry to permit sub\-micron measurement accuracy coupled with flexible deployment in complex structures and hazardous environments was researched at Heriot\-Watt \(Harrison, Maier, Barton, Jones\) and subsequently transferred to AWE from 2004\-present. That research has created a core technology that underpinned a series of critical AWE internal engineering trials which could not have been performed otherwise. These trials are essential to assurance activities, enabling access to empirical data to inform key decisions whilst enabling the development of a more cost\-effective future programme. 

 **Trace gas sensing** has provided a route to monitor material changes in sealed environments. The complexity of the environment and sensor constraints posed by AWE are unique and pose demands which could not be met by existing technologies. Heriot\-Watt researchers \(Carter, Maier\) demonstrated optical technologies which enabled AWE, to achieve continuous in\-situ monitoring of gaseous species in the test environment. 

 **System Integration** poses specific challenges in meeting AWE requirements. There is the need to provide fibre optic access to sealed cavities without compromising structural component integrity. This was addressed by developing original fibre embedding processes through Heriot\-Watt’s innovative additive manufacturing of polymers \(Maier\) in which the fibre is embedded as an integral part of the manufacturing process. These manufacturing strategies and novel architectures are at the forefront of sensor integration. As a result AWE and Heriot\-Watt are now able to embed fibres and optical sensors directly into metallic composites \(Maier, MacPherson\). The resultant know\-how and capabilities are enabling AWE to progress in implementing sensor suites in long term, engineering test environments prior to deployment in increasingly complex systems. AWE consider that this disruptive technology has the potential to deliver more efficient manufacturing processes with savings in the tens of millions of pounds. 

 The AWE Heriot\-Watt research partnership has culminated in research that has created bespoke sensor and instrumentation systems designed to support long duration tests, typically 25\+ years. HWU and AWE have worked together to achieve understanding of commercially available components and those developed by research in order to satisfy those timescales. Together they possess all necessary expertise to build and deploy complete instrumentation systems \(MacPherson\), and hold all relevant development knowledge and IP. That expertise has become the backbone of future sensing capabilities across a wide range of sensing requirements in AWE. This knowledge provides AWE with an unprecedented new capability in deploying the technology across their development, test, engineering, storage, monitoring and maintenance activities. The direct benefit is the ability to make otherwise infeasible but critical measurements, hence improving safety and reducing risks, and substantially reducing costs. Indirectly, access to and the ability to influence the direction of emerging technologies and techniques, ensures that AWE’s scientific and engineering expertise benefitting their staff in their wider professional networks.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 For AWE, the impact of this work has been both significant and enduring \[5.1\]. For almost 70 years, AWE has been responsible for delivering and maintaining the UK’s nuclear deterrent. Since 1996, when the UK became a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, it has no longer been possible to assure the safety and performance of the UK nuclear deterrent using data obtained from new underground tests. In response, AWE has retained an ongoing need to develop alternative approaches to obtain empirical data relating to the operation and safety of designs, systems, components and materials. AWE’s Strategic Alliance Partnership with Heriot\-Watt University has been invaluable in developing solutions to address these challenges \[5.2\]. 

 The greatest individual success, in terms of impact, has been the successful deployment of optical gap gauge sensors within a unique AWE\-fielded weapon sub\-system engineering trial \[5.3, 5.4, 5.5\]. The challenge of retrofitting an existing design with miniaturised diagnostics, capable of operating to high level of accuracy and precision, is extremely demanding. To date commercially available devices are unable to meet the deployment requirements. The unique optical sensor technology and interrogation hardware used in this trial arose directly because of the research performed at Heriot\-Watt. As a direct result of this trial, AWE has been able to obtain in\-situ measurements that would have been impossible to obtain through any other means, providing new understanding of how weapon sub\-systems perform within dynamic environments. The most significant benefit of performing this work has been to provide increased confidence and assurance in assessments made relating to the deterrent, helping AWE to underpin the UK’s security and defense through its ability to continue to maintain Continuous at Sea Deterrence. A significant secondary benefit from this work has been the de\-risking of future programme activities, enabling the scale of planned work to be reduced. This represents an estimated cost saving to the MoD of \~GBP25,000,000 within AWE’s GBP1,000,000,000 annual budget. 

 In addition to engineering trials, a significant amount of work performed at AWE involves research into how a wide variety of unconventional materials types behave over extended timescales. AWE has benefited from joint research with Heriot\-Watt in this area to develop new knowledge and expertise. Projects have been tasked with designing, developing and maturing technology options to enable empirical data linked to chemical ageing to be obtained \[5.6\]. These data are critical to the decades long deployment, storage and decommissioning cycles with which AWE must contend. The sensor technology developed so far has been able to facilitate a more targeted approach to future materials ageing programmes, which are costly and time consuming. Obtaining more frequent, higher quality data in an automated manner has led to a high degree of confidence that material and component properties have not changed over decades long deployment, thus significantly reducing the need for physical inspection with the associated safety benefit from reduced staff exposure to extreme\-hazard materials. Fewer inspections and tests have also resulted in a reduction in the associated footprint and other overhead costs required to support these activities, again leading to a more cost\-effective programme of work, saving many millions of pounds. \[5.7\] 

 The highly specialized nature of these applications has necessitated in radically new approaches being identified. However, impact for these techniques expands beyond AWE’s interest as evidenced by an in\-progress patent \(GBP1,820,122.8\), providing intellectual property for the UK Government, whilst others have been published in peer reviewed journals, enhancing AWE’s reputation and visibility internationally. 

 The interactions with Heriot\-Watt have also led to an increase in AWE’s organizational agility, facilitating a significant amount of higher risk \(in terms of success\) lower Technology Research Level \(TRL\) research activities that would previously have been performed by AWE staff. Facilities, expertise, and capabilities made available to AWE via the alliance have further increased AWE’s operational capabilities without increasing in\-house costs in terms of staff and equipment. This has enabled the company to redirect these staff to support activities that can only be performed at AWE – improving the company’s delivery to their customer, providing an indirect cost saving. 

 The overall span of work that has been run with Heriot\-Watt has enabled AWE to demonstrate the effectiveness of our capabilities to our key customer, MoD and has significantly improved our visibility and standing with AWE’s key partners in the US.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers in Bath Spa University’s Writing for Young People faculty have demonstrated the importance of writing ambitious, wide\-ranging, and experimental literature for young audiences. Their research increases readers’ empathy for others and facilitates thoughtful engagement with the world around them – much needed qualities in the current global situation. Reading their books gave young people new understandings of the world, for example young readers had learnt about “facing our fears and having the courage to be different”, as well as gaining the knowledge that “our beautiful world is always around us, we just need to remember to appreciate it” \(from a selection of over 45 online reviews, E3\). The Writing for Young People research team are acknowledged as a distinctive force in the field of creative writing, disseminating their research through school visits, reading projects and an MA that has seen over 66 debut authors published by mainstream publishers since 2004. They have had a wide\-reaching, impact on the publishing industry and a new generation of writers; a leading expert on children’s literature stated that their “focus on developing the craft of writing has helped to ensure that writing for children, whether it is literary or commercial, is regarded as a serious genre of fiction” \(E6\).

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research by the Writing for Young People team at Bath Spa University has explored the ways in which writing for young people helps to develop empathy and deepens readers’ understandings of themselves and their relationship with the world around them. The researchers have also examined how experimentation and innovation across literature for multiple age groups can enrich the field of writing for young people and encourage distinctive voices in a new generation of writers. This research is significant and innovative within the field of creative writing, which often focuses on the effects of writing for adults. The Writing for Young People research team are creating new knowledge about the complexity, richness, and benefits of writing for young people. 

###  Empathy and new understandings of the world 

 The research team employ writing as a research methodology, exploring the ways in which fiction can draw young readers into a story, creating empathy between readers and the characters as they navigate complex and challenging events and decisions. The research invites deep learning from the process of empathising with others and asks young people to consider what values and behaviours they would like to integrate into their own lives. 

 Almond, Christopher, Green, Nadin, Skuse and Voake have developed original approaches to narrative and structure in order to engage their readers and to address universal themes and important issues through the specific experiences of young protagonists. In *A Song for Ella Grey* \(2014, R1\), Ella’s best friend Claire is employed as the narrator. This narrative choice compels the reader to watch with Claire from the side\-lines as Ella is caught up in a tragic tale, and draws the reader into Claire’s process of grieving, her desire to celebrate Ella’s life, and her discovery of how to move forward after the loss of her friend. 

 *The Killing Woods* \(2014, R2\) employs two narrators, each with different knowledge of events, highlighting the difficulty of knowing the truth about the world and exploring the ways in which an individual’s choices, words and actions influence others, while *The Deviants* \(2016, R5\) makes use of an unreliable narrator who gradually reveals the uncomfortable truths she is trying to hide from herself, the world, and the reader. *To the Edge of the World* \(2018, R3\) and *The House of Light* \(2018\) both make use of close narrative, employing the third\-person in a carefully controlled manner that makes the reader feel that they are travelling alongside the protagonist and viewing the world from his or her perspective. 

 The Writing for Young People research team have explored empathy through the process of writing, employing characters’ partial knowledge of events and their limited, sometimes unreliable, perspectives in order to compel the reader to ask questions, fill in the gaps and relate to the characters. The discoveries made through this research has deepened the researchers’ knowledge of how to draw young readers into a close relationship with the story’s narrator. These discoveries provide new knowledge for other practitioners and future generations of writers and are shared through academic papers and attendance at conferences and workshops, including an annual, collaborative research conference with Vermont College of Fine Arts and presentations at Association of Writers and Writing Programs conferences \(USA\), which included a 2013 session on *‘*Sex, Love and Censorship in Young Adult Fiction’. 

###  Experimentation, depth and breadth 

 As well as exploring narrative and empathy, the research team are known for their experimentation with language and form, and their determination to write meaningful works for readers across all age ranges and multiple genres within the discipline of Writing for Young People. Experimentation with language and form by the researchers includes the playful use of language and inclusion of regional dialect, showing that universal themes can be explored through the speech and culture of people in a very specific place and time. Researchers have developed expertise in specific areas, including the evocation of place and experimenting with the role of setting as a key component of storytelling. 

 Respecting the intelligence of their young readers, researchers have reworked and re\-presented classic stories for a new audience. *Storm\-wake* \(2018, R2\) revisits *The Tempest*, merging aspects of Shakespearean theatrical form with conventions of modern YA \(Young Adult\) novels, while *A Song for Ella Grey* \(2014, R1\) retells the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice in present day Tyneside, making it accessible and relevant to a young adult audience. Researchers are also introducing classic works of literature to a younger audience, with an illustrated retelling of Jane Austen’s *Sense and Sensibility: Awesomely Austen* \(2020, R4\). 

 The research team are committed to exploring the breadth of writing and publishing for young people. They have produced picture books tackling themes of loss and fear \( *The Dam,* 2018; *Shadow*, 2019, R2\) and series fiction for younger readers \( *Flying Fergus* series, 2016\-19, R4; *Hooey Higgins* series *,* 2014, R6 *; Maxwell Mutt* series, 2016\-2019, R6\) that encourage a love of reading for pleasure. They are also inspiring young audiences to gain new knowledge of the world through non\-fiction publication \( *Alan Turing, A Life Story,* 2020, R4\). 

 Knowledge arising from the research \(including research on empathy, setting, voice, narrative, tone, and process\) is communicated to Writing for Young People MA students, enriching the work of a new generation of writers. This research is also disseminated through the teaching of language, creative writing and literature in schools and other organisations, as well through festivals and events related to the publishing industry.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Bath Spa University Writing for Young People research is demonstrated in three key, interlinked ways: impact on young readers, impact on practitioners and impact on industry. 

###  Developing young readers’ capacity for empathy and opening up new perspectives 

 The team’s research has impacted on the richness, range and quality of books available to young people. Experimentation with narrative, language, setting and form have led to numerous prize nominations and awards: Almond won the Andersen SuperPremio *\(*Italy\) in 2019 and the Guardian Children’s Fiction Award \(UK\) in 2015 and was nominated every year from 2014\-2020 for the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award \(the world's largest award for children's and young adult literature\); over the same period, research team members have received 6 nominations for the UK’s most prestigious award \- the CILIP Carnegie Medal \- amongst many other nominations \(E1, p1\). Bath Spa University researchers sold 196,411 copies of 40 publications in the UK between August 2013 and December 2020 \(using Nielsen Bookscan TCM data, which covers approximately 90% of all UK retail print book purchases\) and they have been published in over 20 countries, including Germany, Italy, Australia, the USA, Brazil, Vietnam and China \(E1, p1\). In encouraging reading for pleasure, researchers have supported young people’s learning and opportunities in life, as well as developing their capacity for empathy \(E2; E3\). Researchers have an “incredible respect” for young audiences \(E5, p1\), resulting in research that opens up new worlds, new knowledge, new approaches to language and new ways of thinking, as evidenced by readers’ responses to their work \(E3\). The BBC adaptation of Nadin’s *Joe All Alone* \(published 2015; TV adaptation 2018\) reached a wide audience \(CBBC reaches c. 500k weekly visitors\) and won a BAFTA \(2018\) and an NI Royal Television Society Award \(2018\), as well as being nominated for an International Emmy in 2019 \(E1, p1; E9\). Comments posted on the CBBC website by young viewers showed that they were deeply involved with the storyline and themes, and that they empathised with the problems faced by its characters, with some offering advice on how Joe should deal with his situation \(E9, p1\). 

 Psychology research has demonstrated that reading for pleasure develops empathy and can provide readers with significant improvements in their emotional vocabulary and emotional knowledge, leading to positive changes to their real\-world helping behaviours \(Kumschick et al., 2014; E2, p1\-2\). An examination of reviews by book bloggers and reading group members demonstrates that young readers have been deeply engaged by the narrative voices and characters in books written by Bath Spa University researchers. One 15\-year\-old reviewer of *A Song for Ella Grey* described how “I found myself with an ache in my chest as I was reading it, and I realised that I was feeling what the characters did” \(E3\). Many readers appreciated the complexity of the books’ protagonists \(“\[the\] main character is so flawed and complex”; “I sympathised with her so much”; “Something about how he so desperately wanted to believe the story he was telling struck me so hard I literally had to stop and reread the passage a couple of times”; E3, p1\) and stated that they had gained new perspectives on the world as a result of their reading \(“The story handled really serious and sensitive topics that really got me thinking”; E3, p2\). Adults also gained empathic insights from reading these books, reconnecting with their younger selves, and gaining vital understandings of the emotions and issues that challenge young people today. These adult reviewers included teachers and school librarians, whose ability to connect and empathise with young people is fundamental to their jobs. A secondary school teacher wrote of *The Deviants*: “so many incredibly important issues are touched upon in this one book but they are all made to feel so relevant and significant, it was a real reminder of what life can be like for a teenager” \(E3, p1\). 

 Faculty members extended the reach of their research through school visits, author residencies and festival appearances, reaching over 20,000 people through in person events, and at least 15,000 more through events broadcast on television, radio and online \(E4\). Visits ranged from workshops for small groups of children, to class events for 30\-60 children, and festival events for audiences of 150\-300. During a residency with The Literature Centre \(Australia’s only centre for young people’s reading and writing\) Christopher spoke to over 3,000 gifted and talented students across Western Australia in 2014, and another 3,000 in 2018 \(E4, p5\-6\). Meanwhile, Christopher’s *The Killing Woods* \(2014\) is used as a set text on 2 curriculums across 4 secondary schools in Mexico City \(reaching approximately 2000 students from 2014 \- 2019\). A teacher from one of these schools said that the reading program focused around Christopher’s books and author visits makes their students **“better human beings”** \(E7, p1\). Confirming the importance of author publications and visits, a primary school librarian discussed a 2018 visit from Green, saying: **“Her visit definitely had an impact on the children and me, and we talked about her ideas afterwards, and about challenging stereotypes and looking for other new children’s books that were doing the same”** \(E7, p2\). 

 In 2018, The Reading Agency sent 100 packs featuring Green’s *To The Edge of the World* \(2018\) to Chatterbooks reading groups in public and school libraries across the UK \(Chatterbooks is the UK's largest network of children's reading groups, with almost 9,000 members\). 10 and 11\-year\-old group members described the book it as “A heart\-warming read. Daring and joyful emotions all in one book” and felt that the story was **“all about facing our fears and having the courage to be different”** \(E3, p2\). Another of Green’s books, *The Wilderness War* \(2016\), was a key text used by East Ayrshire Council to encourage learning outdoors; a councillor stated that this reading program created: “memorable, meaningful times that help young people enjoy their learning, so it stays with them into adulthood” \(E3, p2\). One 10\-year\-old reader said that *The Wilderness War* was “a wonder of a book that teaches you a crucial lesson about the wilderness and is a must read for anyone interested in animals, books and the wilderness *”* \(E3, p2\). 

 Environmental researchers have argued for the importance of narrative in children’s books in promoting the development of environmental empathy and environmental literacy, while psychologists have demonstrated that resilience and empathy are very closely related to psychological wellbeing in young people \(McKnight, 2010; Vinayak and Judge, 2018; E2, p5\-6\). A primary school teacher reviewing Green’s *The House of Light* said: “the resounding message is one of hope and the belief that individuals can make positive changes and shine their light in a challenging world” \(E3, p2\). 

###  Impact on practitioners: developing a new generation of writers 

 Research through experimentation in form, language and subject is disseminated to other practitioners through the MA in Writing for Young People at Bath Spa University, festival workshops, school visits and exhibitions. 

 The MA in Writing for Young People has impacted on a new generation of writers for young audiences. Alumni published 43 debut books between 2014\-2020 and have been nominated for and won many awards \(including winning the 2019 Costa Children's Book Award; E1, p1\). These writers are appreciative of the impact of faculty research expertise on their own practice and how the research team’s strengths have enhanced and added to their own skills as writers: “\[my book\] would not have been this good, if it were not for the things I’ve learned on this course”; “The MA was key to my writing journey \- from start to end \- I would not have written my debut without it”; “I have learned to become a better more conscious writer”; “Getting my Costa Award would not have happened without the MA” \(quotes from interviews and feedback from over 30 alumni; E5, p1\). An agent for children’s writers and illustrators at United Agents stated that some alumni might have got published without the course but “I think they are better writers because of the course” \(E6, p6\). the publishing director of David Fickling Books sees a “strong pattern” in the work of alumni: **“stories that are given a special edge, a truly distinctive and original twist, by singing with the author’s own truth”** \(E6, p1\). 

 Numerous local, national and international events between 2014 and 2020 have established the faculty research as a cornerstone of excellence in writing for young people \(E4\). *Where Your Wings Were* \(2018\), an exhibition of Almond’s work, was held at Seven Stories: The National Centre for Children’s Books in Newcastle \(approximately 80,000 visitors a year\). A YA writer, who interviewed Almond in an author event at Seven Stories, said of the exhibition: “the power of stories and the ancient human instinct to tell them flies with you out of this gallery” \(E8\). 

###  Shaping the industry of Writing for Young People 

 The research team’s work has been published and sold in large quantities \(E1\); but it is the experimentation, depth and breadth of their research that has had most impact on the industry. Award\-winning books \(E1, p1\) and research have played an important role in raising public and industry awareness of quality writing for children and young people and its reappraisal as a significant and meaningful form of literature. An annual event, with a panel of recently published alumni, takes place at the Bath Festival of Children’s Literature \(Europe’s largest dedicated children’s literature festival\). The event involves discussion of MA writing and research on the industry, provides a barometer of writing for young people, and brings together researchers, writers, editors and potential new authors \(E4, p13\). 

 Industry experts are clear on the far\-reaching impact of Bath Spa University research on the children’s publishing industry and on literary culture. *The Bookseller* writes of Green’s name “being whispered in the halls of… Bologna Children’s Book Fair” \(the key global children’s publishing event; over 1,400 exhibitors; approximately 30,000 professional visitors\) due to the success of MA graduates \(E6, p8\). Chicken House publisher and managing director discussed the impact of specific researchers on the industry, saying that Skuse’s writing “has had profound influences on new generations of writers”, while Christopher’s research has helped to change the way publishers look at the YA market “encouraging a more mature level of content with a high level of personal identification with themes and characters” \(E6, p5\). He also talked about the “unique blend of adventurous content” combined with firm style and structure that makes Bath Spa alumni distinctive \(E6, p5\). A children’s book expert and director of the Hay Children’s Book Festival noted that alumni’s publications were “extending inclusivity by portraying all kinds of childhood experiences not just the ones that are most likely to attract headlines” \(E6, p3\), while the publishing director of David Fickling Books confirmed that they were contributing to diversity within the industry and offered “a wider perspective than many others on the market in this area” \(E6, p2\). An agent for children’s writers and illustrators at United Agents stated that Bath Spa University’s research “is taken extremely seriously in the industry” putting “a mark of quality against them that is rare, or kind of unique” and “has impacted the wider field of children’s literature” \(E6, p6\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Mental health\-related involuntary hospital detentions have more than doubled in England over the last 30 years, and high rates of readmission following mental health crisis care are recognised as a shortcoming of current care provision. Research at UCL has underpinned the recommendations for national policy change to improve care and reduce detention in the Independent Review of the Mental Health Act in England and subsequent White Paper. A model of community care that reduces readmissions and improves patient experience has been developed, along with a means of defining, measuring and achieving high quality in\-community crisis care that is central both to NHS England’s programme for improving quality care, and to additional policy initiatives abroad. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2018/2019, there were 64,845 admissions to acute mental health inpatient wards. This summary describes findings and impacts from three linked research programmes on mental health crisis care, led by Professor Johnson and Dr Lloyd\-Evans at UCL. 

 1\) The UCL team have conducted a programme of research over two decades examining ways of diverting people from acute hospitalisation. Crisis Resolution Teams \(CRTs\) are a service model that has been implemented internationally and in all English health care regions since they were mandated in the NHS Plan \(2000\). CRTs provide brief periods of intensive home treatment as an alternative to hospital admission for people in mental health crisis. The North Islington randomised controlled trial \( **R1**\) evaluated this model at the time of its introduction and demonstrated that CRTs reduce inpatient admissions. Odds ratios for being admitted for those in the CRT\-treatment group compared to a Treatment As Usual \(TAU\) control group were 0.19 \(CI 0.11\-0.32\) at eight weeks follow up and 0.20 \(CI 0.12\-0.34\) at six months. In the trial, inpatient bed use \(mean bed days over six months follow up\) was correspondingly reduced to 16 per patient in the CRT group, compared to 35 in the TAU control group. Service users’ satisfaction with acute care was 1.6 points higher in the mean score on the questionnaire for the treatment group on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire scale at eight\-week follow\-up. An accompanying economic evaluation by the UCL team using data from the trial shows that CRTs are cost\-effective. When in\-patient costs were included, CRT\-care saved GBP2,438 per patient \(90% CI 937\-3,922\) over the six\-month follow\-up period after adjusting for the baseline costs. The research team also investigated the effectiveness of other adjunctive models of crisis care in reducing admissions and improving patient experience. 

 2\) Following this trial, the UCL team conducted two studies \(making up the CORE programme\), focused on refining the CRT model and improving quality of crisis care. 

 First was a series of national surveys to describe service provision and variation in crisis care and generate benchmarking data \( **R2**\). Informed by a systematic review and a national programme of qualitative research with multiple stakeholders, the following were developed: a model of best practice, a fidelity scale and an accompanying quality assessment process for CRTs; the latter were previously underspecified as a service model in research and policy guidance \( **R3**\). A set of service improvement resources for CRTs were developed and tested in a multi\-site cluster randomised trial of 25 CRTs. The service improvement programme was effective in improving CRTs’ model fidelity and reducing inpatient admissions by 12% \(incidence rate ratio, IRR 0.88 \(CI 0.83\-0.94\)\) and bed use by 4% \(IRR 0.96 \(CI 0.95\-0.97\) \( **R4**\). The research generated an evidence\-based model of how to achieve and sustain high quality in community alternatives to hospital. 

 The second CORE programme study \(informed by qualitative stakeholder interviews and two systematic reviews of relevant literature\) developed, piloted and evaluated a peer\-supported self\-management programme for people leaving acute care, designed to support recovery, improve continuity of care, and reduce readmissions to crisis care. In a trial involving six NHS sites, the programme proved effective in reducing readmissions from 38% in the control group to 29% in the treatment group \(odds ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.43–0.99\) over one year follow\-up \(the primary trial outcome\) and increasing service users’ satisfaction with care \( **R5**\). 

 3\) Focusing on hospital\-based acute care, in 2017\-19 the research team were commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care through the NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit to conduct a national review of the legal frameworks and process for involuntary admission to hospital to support the work of the Independent Review of the Mental Health Act \( **R6**\). The UCL team’s research consisted of: 

1.  systematic reviews of crisis planning interventions; compulsory community treatment; social and clinical predictors of detention; interventions to reduce detentions; and service users’ and carers’ experiences of detention 

1.  evidence syntheses and model building to understand international variation in rates of detention, and the rising rate of detentions in England since 1983.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 This body of research has provided crucial evidence to change national and international policy and practice in mental health crisis care, with resulting benefits for patients \(in particular reduced use of hospital detention\) and significant cost savings to the NHS. 

 **Impact on UK mental health policy** 

 The UCL team worked closely on the Independent Review of the Mental Health Act \(MHA Review\) launched by the UK Government in 2017. The MHA Review was specifically tasked with addressing the steeply rising rate of detentions in England and the ethnic inequalities in rates of detentions, and to provide recommendations for modernising the legal structures and processes for detention, most of which are unchanged since the 1983 MHA. As well as co\-ordinating specifically commissioned research **\[R6\]**, they provided expert advice to committees and working groups in areas including ‘Crisis Planning Intervention’, ‘Compulsory Community Treatment to Prevent Readmissions’ and ‘Understanding Increasing Rates of Detention’. Their work is contained in the 40\-page research summary included in the Review Report *Modernising the Mental Health Act* **\[S1\]**. This summarised nine research studies completed by the UCL team \(eight evidence reviews and an analysis of health records – all subsequently published as scientific papers, including a summary of the report itself as **\[R6\]**\), covering reviews of interventions to reduce detentions, risk factors for being detained, international comparisons of legal systems and detention rates, and the nature of and patterns in the rise in detentions in England. “ *As a result, the \[review\] was directly informed by research evidence to an unprecedented extent*. \[…\] *This body of research helped shape the Review’s recommendations and strengthened the case for policy change*” **\[S2\]**. 

 Specific examples of recommendations underpinned by the UCL team ‘s research are **\[S2\]**: 

 i\)  The recommendation that patients at risk of detention should routinely be supported to write Advance Choice Documents. 

 ii\) Recommendations for increased limits and safeguards for the use of Community Treatment Orders in England. 

 ii\) A clear list of recommendations including enhanced rights for patients to: advocacy and choice over who acts as their nominated relative; a clear treatment plan early in detention; and challenge specific treatments while detained. 

 Recommendation i\) was immediately accepted by Government on the day of the Review launch, and in the 2019 Queen’s speech the Government committed to legislating to implement all the recommendations from the MHA Review, leading to the publication of a White Paper in January 2021. 

 The programme of research for the MHA **\[R6\]** also established important evidence gaps in this field, including **:** how to arrest the rising rate of detentions in England; understanding and improving the experiences of detained patients from Black and minority ethnic groups, and improving carers’ experiences – three areas prioritised in a subsequent NIHR research call. These were reinforced and prioritised through a public event and online survey organised by Johnson through the Mental Health Policy Research Unit in March 2019, generating a list of priorities shared with Department of Health and Social Care policy leads. This has led to a GBP4,000,000 DHSC\-commissioned research call for *“research to address gaps in the evidence base as identified through recommendations arising from the Independent Review of the Mental Health Act \(MHA\)*” **\[S3\]**. 

 **Impact on national and international practice, guidelines and resources** 

 The UCL research is cited in the NICE 2014 *Schizophrenia Guidelines \(CG178 Psychosis and schizophrenia in adults: prevention and management* **\[S4\]**; as evidence of the patient benefits and cost\-effectiveness of CRTs, the UCL randomised controlled trial **\[R1\]** underpins its recommendation that CRTs should be provided in every catchment area as an alternative to inpatient admission. The research also led directly to new recommendations for peer support and manualised self\-management programmes in mental health **\[S4\]**. 

 The research has been used by NHS England to evidence national practice and resource allocation. According to NHS England’s Mental Health Crisis Care Lead, the Spending Review for Mental Health in 2015 was nearly completed, with no commitments around crisis care *.* “ *At the time it was extremely challenging to make the case for anything for mental health without a clear evidence base and ‘invest to save’ case. I was very grateful to be able to use the CORE study and associated systematic review to provide evidence that crisis teams did have intended impact where implemented in full \[…\]. Through this we were able to use the CORE study to make the case to the Treasury for funding to implement all crisis teams to a high fidelity”* **\[S2\].** This resulted in allocated funding in the spending review of GBP419,000,000 for CRTs and ‘crisis alternatives’ over four years from 2017/18, including GBP69,000,000 available through Clinical Commissioning Group baselines in 2017\-2019 **\[R5\].** Evidence from the fidelity study **\[R4\]** was used successfully in the modelling for this exercise, showing that, where implemented to high fidelity, patient experience improved and hospital admissions decreased, and that the issue lay not with the Crisis Team Model but in the failure to implement and resource them as intended. The research team helped distil the key findings into simple clear messages for commissioners – “ *This clarity has now supported use of ringfenced transformation funds – with every single area confirming that they will implement and resource teams to high fidelity by 2021”* **\[S2\]** *.* NHS England has used the CORE Fidelity scale in several policy and guidance documents **\[S5\]** as a target to drive service improvement, including the Crisis Care Concordat, NHS *Implementing the five\-year view for mental health* and *Crisis and Acute Care for Adults*. These reports provided a national agreement between services and agencies involved in the care and support of people in crisis, and highlight additional funding for CRTs and ‘crisis alternatives’ to implement best practice, in line with CORE CRT fidelity standards; “ *With significant restrictions \[…\] on being able to publish new NHSE guidance, being able to provide a simple link to the fidelity scale was even more helpful. I know that this has led to fidelity reviews across the country*” **\[S2\]**. 

 The research has generated increased resourcing for crisis and post\-crisis support. Local crisis care clinical leads report using the CRT fidelity scale and service improvement programme trial and resource pack to construct business cases for additional resources, and to inform and support service improvement initiatives within CRTs. The peer\-supported self\-management programme trial influenced them to retain and expand peer support resources, design their training, and define their role **\[S2\].** Cardiff and Vale University Health Board \(Wales\) have introduced the intervention to their early intervention in psychosis team to a positive response and are recruiting a peer support worker and building the plan into team performance measures **\[S6\].** 

 The research has also influenced practice internationally. The CORE CRT Fidelity Scale has been recommended in an international review of fidelity measures conducted under the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Evidence Based Practices Program **\[S7\]** as the only tool suitable for measuring good practice in mental health crisis care. UCL’s evidence base for CRTs has led to national policy programmes and, crucially, the inclusion of crisis home treatment in health insurance schemes in Switzerland and Germany **\[S2\]**. The University of Sydney \(Australia\) have begun adapting the peer\-supported self\-management workbook to an Australian setting, although the work has been delayed by the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[S6\]**. 

 **Impact of reduced readmissions** 

 The high rates of readmission following mental health crisis care are recognised as a shortcoming of current acute mental health care provision. The CORE peer\-supported, self\-management programme helped significantly reduce readmissions following CRT care in six study sites from 38% to 29%. As well as providing a much better outcome for the patients involved, this resulted in GBP270 in cost savings \(using 2018/2019 values\) for each person who received the intervention \(including the cost of training and supervision for the peers delivering the intervention\). In the 2018/2019 year there were 64,845 admissions to acute mental health inpatient wards. Assuming that people who are admitted have 1.5 admissions per year, \~43,000 people had an admission to an acute mental health ward in 2018/2019. On this basis, if the intervention were to be rolled out across the NHS England, and all 43,000 people were given the intervention, this would translate to cost savings of GBP11,600,000 per annum **\[S8\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Practice\-based research by Gary Embury at UWE has challenged and changed both perceptions and the practice of reportage drawing or ‘visual journalism’. His work has impacted widely, domestically and internationally, through his publications and exhibitions, and his personal contributions to participatory projects, residencies, symposia, conferences, editorships and awards. His work has enriched and changed the understanding and practice of reportage among both leading practioners, and many artists and illustrators earlier in their careers. He has challenged the assumption that ‘on the spot drawing’ is a passive observational activity, demonstrating to an increasingly wide\-ranging, international network of practitioners, that reportage constitutues proactive journalistic practice – and in the process shifting and enriching that practice itself. His work has shown that in an age of digital media and 24\-hour rolling news, traditional analogue drawing is still a valuable interpreter of contemporary events. Embury’s research has impacted on artists and practioners, art directors, publishers, educators and students. It has also impacted on wide\-ranging public perceptions and experiences of reportage drawing, in a new age of visual journalism across multiple media channels. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Reseach carried out by Gary Embury has included written and published outputs, including the influential *Reportage Illustration: Visual Journalism* \( **R1**\); practice\-based outputs, including Embury’s own work in *Reportage Illustration* and its exhibition \( **R2**\); and practice\-based work produced in collaboration with others through residencies and events \( **R3, R4**\). 

 Traditionally placed within the field of illustration, reportage drawing in the 20<sup>th</sup> century had been largely eclipsed by the public’s belief in the photographic image as an objective conveyor of truth, relegated to little more than a decorative page filler. More recently, digital images and print media have been increasingly questioned as a guarantee of truth, leaving a void to be filled by other forms of journalism. 

 Embury’s research demonstrated the opportunity for reportage to reclaim and redefine the role of ‘visual journalist’ \( **R1**\). According to Embury, much current illustration exists on a purely aesthetic level as ambient decoration. It fails to comment, debate or inform, but merely exists on a secondary level to support the text. Embury’s research has laid the groundwork for artists to re\-establish themselves as a pro\-active research\-led community. \( **R1**, **R5**, **R2**\) Artists are now able to question the traditional role of drawing in news reporting and the impact drawing can have on the way in which an event is covered. Embury quotes Milton Glazer, the celebrated American graphic designer, who once stated: ‘ *The great benefit of drawing is not to replicate reality but to understand what is real*.’ 

 Embury’s own practice\-based research has included reportage drawing for a number of exhibitions, publications and awards. In 2016, he produced work as one of 16 international artists for a cross\-media storytelling project exhibited at The Paten Museum in Nepal \( **S5**\), subsequently published in *Varoom* magazine. Embury has also been the recipient of the prestigious Association of Illustrators Gold Award, exhibited at a number of UK galleries and contributed a number of drawings for the critically acclaimed *Beneficial Shock* magazine. In 2018, Embury exhibited work at the Topolski Studio on London’s Southbank as part of the ‘Drawn in Residence’ project \( **R2**\) with the Topolski Residency Artists, in conjunction with Chelsea and Westminster hospital.

 Embury’s research has encouraged a greater understanding and debate around reportage drawing, with illustrators seen as pro\-active visual journalists. Much of this work is brought together and showcased in the web\-based journal and platform  [*Reportager*](http://reportager.uwe.ac.uk/projects18/booklaunch/index.htm), edited by Embury since 2013, with a membership of some 35 active artists and illustrators \( **R5**\). 

 Through practice\-based residencies, networks and events, Embury, as a practitioner and researcher, has sought to establish an international community, bringing together artists, art directors, journalists and academics to question the role of the reportage artist and how the artist documents and comments through drawing contemporary society \( **R3**, **R4**\). Embury’s research identified a significant gap in the field for critical discussion on the role of the artist reporter \( **R6**\). The research has aimed to inspire a new generation of reportage artists to scrutinise and uncover visual narratives, and to disseminate these through a range of online, digital and analogue means; authorially co\-designing, self\-publishing content and proactively collaborating with journalists as an alternative to traditional print and broadcast journalism \( **R3**\).

 Embury’s own creative practice has broadened understanding and illustrated how reportage artists can cross the divide and change the balance from passively making commissioned images to proactively and authorially creating content driven, media rich visual essays. This includes collaborating with designers, journalists and art directors in an equal partnership, to founding and curating the international reportage award and making and curating *Reflections 2016* \- a cross disciplinary exhibition. Embury has given many public talks and workshops for prestigious organisations and venues including: Ravenna, Italy at the Komikazen Festival; Temple University Tokyo; the Victoria and Albert Museum \(V&A\) and the House of illustration in London; and The Arnolfini in Bristol.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Impact on artists, art directors and educators**Embury’s research has highlighted and redefined the work of established and emerging artists domestically and internationally to other artists, art directors, educators and the public. It has raised their profile and the work of unknown and early career artists, demonstrating that ‘ *there is in fact a thriving community of critically astute reportage illustrators’* \( **S1**\). 

 As a result of Embury’s research, reportage and documentary drawing is now established and underlined as a distinct practice, outlining its specific journalistic intent, which is unique and different to that of ‘urban sketching.’ 

 A renowned reportage artist and author of *The Etiquette of the Arms Trade* noted its influence: 

 *‘Your \[Embury’s\] research \[ **R1**\] has had a profound impact on my understanding of Illustration in general, and Reportage Drawing in particular, demonstrating that they can be critically acute, experimental and an innovate means of research and communication. I realise now that I had internalised a number of prejudices, assuming that illustration is primarily decorative, and that reportage drawing made false claims to objectivity’* \( **S1**\). 

 **Topolski Studio and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital residencies**Feliks Topolski was one of the most prolific and well\-known illustrator\-artist chroniclers of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. His work spans over half a century and his legacy is preserved in the Topolski Studio Residency Programme based in his original studio on the South Bank of London. 

 Drawing on his own research, Embury co\-founded and delivered the studio’s Chronicle Residency Programme starting in 2013. Funded partly by the South Bank Centre and the studio’s external arts activities, the international annual residency has offered thirty six placements in total to selected postgraduate art students. They each received an expenses paid three months’ residency at the Topolski studio, including masterclasses from Embury and internationally renowned reportage artists. This included workshops in printing, culminating in a publication and exhibition in London and nationally. 

 As part of the residency, students organised public workshops in reportage drawing in and around London’s South Bank. Residents also achieved a Silver Arts Award Qualification, managed by Trinity College London in association with Arts Council England. The award is a personal learning programme which develops and assesses both arts\-related and transferable skills, such as **creativity, communication, planning and teamwork.** 

 Through the Topolski residency: 

 *‘Gary has helped to create a community of like\-minded practitioners, both on the residency and online on the Reportager website, which has led to more debate around the subject and further opportunities to showcase projects’  \( **S2**\). 

 Former residents have gone on to make their living as lecturers, curators, artists and researchers. There have so far been six residencies, including a further recent collaboration with the current permanent artist in residence at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in 2018, culminating in an exhibition at the Topolski studio, a permanent residency at the hospital and publication *Drawn in Residence* \( **R2**\). The Topolski studio residency and the subsequent collaboration with Chelsea and Westminster Hospital are significant as there are currently no discipline\-specific postgraduate study opportunities for reportage artists available internationally. 

 An artist, author and instructor at Parsons School of Design in New York complimented Embury’s work as researcher and practitioner, noting that she had used it as a resource with her own students because it had: 

 *‘brought together many examples of visual journalism and narrative, bringing legitimacy and an academic viewpoint to this important form of communication and citizen journalism’* \( **S3**\). 

 **Awards, exhibitions and impact on public perception of reportage**As part of efforts to promote and highlight this community of artists to the public, Embury founded an international drawing award and exhibition, re\-framing the discipline of ‘on the spot drawing’ \( **S4**\). Through an international call for submissions for entries from professional and student artists, the subsequent award and exhibition promoted, initiated, and repositioned the work of artists as reportage and documentary journalistic drawing within a distinct discipline area. This was the first time reportage drawing had been grouped and exhibited within this new discipline of visual journalism. In total 350 images were exhibited, with entries from artists from the US, China, Mexico, Uganda, South Korea and Australia. The International Reportager Drawing Award and exhibition were sponsored by the Milan\-based global company Moleskine. The company funded two awards and drawing travel bursaries, one professional award to Chandigarh in India, and a student award to Cuba. The total funding amounted to GBP4,800 in total including two additional Moleskine Special Mention awards totalling GBP250 each. 

 Reportage as visual journalism was explored by Embury in the multiple journalism, cross media, 2016 project *Reflections,* culminating in a visual journalistic collaboration involving international journalists, photographers and artists, in the form of a curated parallel exhibition taking place in Nepal and the UK \( **S5**\). **‘** *For the first time, someone had started to bring together examples of best practice. It gave the field gravitas’* \( **S6**\). 

 In 2018, together with The House of Illustration \(a London based public arts organisation dedicated to illustration, founded by Sir Quentin Blake\), Embury organised a sold out ticketed public lecture in front of 70 attendees followed by a panel discussion. The event brought together five leading practitioners and an art director to discuss the future of reportage drawing \( **S7**\) **.** The panel discussed the ethics and future of journalistic drawing. This was followed by Embury’s book launch for *Reportage Illustration Visual Journalism* \( **R1**\) and an exhibition of reportage drawing by leading practitioner and panel member Lucinda Rogers. 

 A former senior art director of the Times newspaper and House of Illustration panellist said of the research: 

 *‘Whereas Reportage is not a new name inside the industry, it has been the label for a very few artists until now. I feel the name has surfaced quite publicly through Gary's work and has now been quite rightly promoted as a positive and exciting movement’* \( **S8**\). 

 In July 2019, Embury gave an open public lecture at the V&A in London to an audience of 70 including Alan Male, Emeritus Professor of Illustration at Falmouth University, presenting reportage drawing as a valuable interpreter of contemporary events, offering a different perspective to that of traditional journalism and 24 hour rolling news \( **S9**\). In the presentation, Embury reiterated that reportage illustration was now finding a new and powerful role in the era of fake news and disposable fast\-moving media, and that reportage art has re\-emerged at a time when we are being bombarded by an endless stream of often confusing images, with no explanation of who made them and for what purpose. This theme was revisited and further discussed in 2019 in an interview for *The Journalist* magazine’ \( **S10**\). 

 A renowned reportage artist, working as a visual journalist for many newspapers, for *The Times* at London’s 2012 Olympics and *The Daily Telegraph* during the 2018 men’s football World Cup in Russia, praised Embury for his contribution to reportage: 

 *‘Gary has brought together a disparate community and created a vital network in an area where much work is solitary. He has started off a conversation about the future of reportage drawing, demonstrating that it is an activity not merely rooted in the past but with a life in the present and a path towards to the future’* \( **S6**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 We have impacted beliefs and behaviours beyond academia on matters concerning the *scope of ethics* through research\-driven writing, public events, and online materials. Our research supports the claim that ethical considerations extend beyond the traditional moral circles of the ‘nearby’ and apply more widely to distant people, future people, and non\-human individuals, whether terrestrial or not. 

 Our research and corresponding engagement activities have been used for community\-building purposes by the NGOs *The Life You Can Save* and the *Centre for Effective Altruism.* Additionally, a variety of analytics show that 10s of 1000s of people from around the globe have engaged with our public philosophy through events and media including *The Conversation*, *The Guardian*, *The Times*, *Fox News*, *Vox*, *The Express*, and *Newsweek*; notably in one of our events, feedback showed 13% of 12,000 people \(respondents\) changed their viewpoint. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Our underpinning research deals with the *scope of ethics.* This requires us to examine challenging questions, such as: Which things in this vast universe *matter*? Which things have interests? Which have rights that give rise to moral obligations? Many believe that all humans matter, regardless of their distance from us. What are the implications for our obligations to distant persons living in extreme poverty, e.g., through charitable giving? What are our duties to nonhuman animals? Or to extra\-terrestrials? Or future generations? Questions such as these demonstrate that our ‘moral circle’ is potentially broad enough to encompass all individuals; this requires a reassessment of both our moral priorities as well as our ‘place’ within the moral universe. 

 We argue that global social structures, which fail to uphold human rights to subsistence are unjust, and that morality demands we contribute to reforming these structures \( **R1**\). In a world where many agents are failing to contribute, and where reform takes considerable time, affluent individuals are under a duty to aid distant needy individuals by giving to NGOs. We further argue that it is not only our duty to give *more* \(a standard focus in the literature\), but to give *better*, that is, more cost\-effectively – the same monetary gift to one life\-saving charity can prevent ten times as many deaths as when given to another \( **R2**\). Duties to give more and duties to give effectively can come apart; in many cases, it may be morally acceptable not to give large sums of money to charity, but nonetheless be wrong to give ineffectively with what money one does choose to donate. These findings support engagement with the ‘effective altruism’ movement, which provides recommendations to those looking for the most cost\-effective ways of making a positive difference with their time, talents, and money \( **R3**\). 

 Looking beyond human persons, we have argued that nonhuman individuals, such as terrestrial animals, also fall within the scope of ethics. In particular, we have argued that an act’s harmfulness can be sufficient to make it wrong, regardless of whether the individual harmed is a human being. Since nonhuman animals are capable of suffering harm at our hands, they fall within our moral circle \( **R4**\). Therefore, there are moral constraints on using animals for food and for medical experimentation. This same harm\-based argument for taking account of nonhuman animals applies to extra\-terrestrials, insofar as we can potentially cause harm to extra\-terrestrials. This, in turn, places important constraints on space exploration, which comes with non\-negligible risks to potential extra\-terrestrial civilizations. Nor do we believe that the scope of ethics ends with those \(human or otherwise\) who exist *presently*. Just as we can be called upon to answer for our behaviours to those who exist presently, so too we can be called upon to answer to future generations, especially considering they will have to contend with a largely broken global ecosystem for which earlier generations bear responsibility \( **R5**\). Finally, we have argued that if the scope of ethics is as wide as suggested above, humanity occupies a less central place in the moral universe than has been traditionally assumed \( **R6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Our activities have expanded people’s circles in two ways: First, they have induced changes in public opinion; second, they have influenced the research and outreach strategies of two effective altruist NGOs. 

 <ins> *Contributing to the Awareness of the Moral Importance of Non\-Humans*</ins> 

 The activities of Sachs and Mulgan have led to increased scepticism about the human\-centred message embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and increased awareness of the fact that the universe is not made for, nor is the dominion of, humankind. 

 Sachs has engaged in activities enabling the spreading of a central message from his recent book \( **R4**\), namely that causing harm to other sentient beings is no less wrong\-making than is causing harm to humans. First, Sachs produced an article for *The Conversation* titled “Eight ethical questions about exploring outer space that need answers” in 2018—an article that challenged its readers to expand their ethical circle by thinking about how humanity’s exploration of space could affect non\-human life forms and environments. This piece was republished in *Quartz*, *The Wire* \(India\), *The Independent*, and the *World Economic Forum*, and in the print edition of *The Scotsman*, among others, and was widely read on all 6 inhabited continents \(see map below\). As of 16 December 2020, it has garnered over 73,000 reads \( **S1**\), putting it in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile for readership among all articles in *The Conversation* in 2017\-18 \(“ *for politics/society/business/arts pieces, the average number of reads is between 10,000 and 20,000*”\) \( **S2**\)—a remarkable figure given that the typical readership for an article in the humanities is many times smaller than that for a typical article in the sciences. Those who read 

this article were challenged to broaden their ethical outlook. 

 Global readership of The Conversation article \(2018\) entitled, “Eight ethical questions about exploring outer space that need answers” 

 In addition, between 1 July 2019 and 7 July 2019, Sachs co\-presented a physics/philosophy cross\-disciplinary exhibit at The Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition \(RSSSE\) called ""A Message from Afar"". The exhibit showcased the SETI \(Search for Extra\-terrestrial Intelligence\) research of the project lead, Prof. Martin Dominik \(University of St Andrews, School of Physics and Astronomy\) and various other researchers, alongside Sachs’s philosophical research. Through the exhibit, we engaged the public in dialogue about, and surveyed them on, how wide our ethical circle ought to be, including whether our efforts to make contact with alien civilizations should be brought to a halt *for the sake of the aliens themselves*. \(This question implicitly draws upon **R4\-R6**.\) The 2019 RSSSE was attended by 12,653 people, an overall increase of 8% from 2018 \(1,500 students \( **S3**\), and ""A Message from Afar"" was covered extensively over a period of many months, e.g. by *The Guardian*, *The Times*, *Fox News*, *Vox*, *The Express*, and *Newsweek* \(with combined total readership/viewers in hundreds of millions worldwide\) \( **S4**\), with *Fox News* commenting that the survey constitutes “at long last” an attempt to understand how the public feels about these questions \( [https://www.foxnews.com/science/what\-would\-you\-do\-if\-we\-found\-aliens\-survey\-asks](https://www.foxnews.com/science/what-would-you-do-if-we-found-aliens-survey-asks)\). The survey, completable both online \( [https://www.fromafar.world/opinion](https://www.fromafar.world/opinion)\) and using iPads at the RSSSE, has received 14,111 responses as of 10 December 2020 and still receives about 80 responses per month, according to Prof. Martin Dominik, who is administering the survey \( **S5**\). The exhibit and survey were so well received that the team were invited to, and did, exhibit again at the Dundee Science Centre. The Head of Development at the Centre reported that hosting “A Message from Afar” helped the Centre “ *to provide an engagement programme that accurately reflects cutting\-edge science and showcases the diversity within STEM careers*” \( **S6**\). 

 Finally, Sachs and Mulgan have both participated in public events seeking to spread the message about humanity not sitting at the centre of the moral universe. Mulgan, for his part, participated in a public debate in 2016 in London, with several hundred people in attendance, on whether the universe has a purpose. He argued there, based on his book \( **R6**\), that the universe *does* have a purpose, but humanity is not central to it, thus showing that humanity does not sit at the centre of the ethical circle. The podcast of the debate \( [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/theforum/does\-the\-universe\-have\-a\-purpose/](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/theforum/does-the-universe-have-a-purpose/)\) was downloaded over 4,000 times, though this is an under estimate – more tellingly, 48% of the audience never studied philosophy \( **S7**\). Sachs, for his part, organized an event at the Edinburgh Science Festival titled ‘Get Your Hands Off Me You Damned Dirty Alien\!’ on 5 April 2018. The audience of 70 people \(members of the public\) were given, as background information, a quote from the first sentence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \( [https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/the\_universal\_declaration\_of\_human\_rights\_an\_archival\_commentary.pdf](https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/the_universal_declaration_of_human_rights_an_archival_commentary.pdf)\), proclaiming the “ *inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family*”. They were asked the following question before and after a panel discussion on human\-alien encounters \(featuring an astrobiologist, a theologian, a political theorist, a philosopher\): *Could the existence of a superior form of life elsewhere in the universe make this proclamation untrue?* Only 16% answered ‘yes’ before the discussion, and 29% answered ‘yes’ afterwards \( [https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/59/3/3.41/4995443](https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/59/3/3.41/4995443)\). In other words, attending this discussion caused a near *doubling* of scepticism about the moral outlook that forms the basis of the most famous and influential human\-centred rights proclamation in history. 

 <ins> *Influencing the</ins> <ins>Research and</ins> <ins>Outreach</ins> <ins>Strategies</ins> <ins>of two</ins> <ins>Effective Altruist</ins> <ins></ins><ins>NGOs*</ins> 

 Drawing upon his research \( **R1\-R3**\) on effective altruism, which argues that privileged people ought to de\-centre their ethical circle by prioritising impacts on others in their deliberation about where they direct their charitable giving, Pummer’s outreach efforts have influenced the research and outreach strategies of two NGOs focusing on ‘effective altruism’ \(as seen with, for example, cost\-effective charitable giving\). 

 First, drawing upon \( **R1\-R3**\), Pummer organized a series of public events and workshops between 2015 and 2017, which forged connections with the *Centre for Effective Altruism* \( [https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/)\) and influenced their focus and research priorities in building an international network of PhD and postdoctoral researchers \( **S8**\). This NGO is the flagship organisation of the effective altruism movement. It serves to educate people about the most cost\-effective ways of improving the world in a number of areas, including world poverty, animal welfare, and reducing risks of existential catastrophes. They do this through conferences, online resources, donor coordination strategies, and grant\-making focused on research and outreach. Their impact as an NGO includes moving approximately USD1,000,000,000 to effective charities \( [https://www.effectivealtruism.org/impact/](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/impact/)\). 

 Second, with two PG Research Assistants and an IT Officer, Pummer produced an easily searchable online database to facilitate outreach and lesson planning on effective charitable giving \(released October 2019\). The NGO *The Life You Can Save* \( [https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/)\) helped to construct the database and are now helping to promote it \( **S8**\). This NGO encourages making charitable giving a regular part of one’s life and it provides publicly available rankings of the cost\-effectiveness of charities, including an ‘impact calculator’ showing how far a given donation can go \( [https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/impact\-calculator/](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/impact-calculator/)\). 

 His article “Effective giving: how the world’s wealthy could help millions more people for free” published on 8 June 2017 in *The Conversation* \(directly inspired by \( **R2**\)\) was read by people in the USA, Australia, Canada, India, South Africa and Europe and was republished in *EconoTimes* \(they reach over 500,000 people \(unique visitors\) per month\) and in *Alliance* \(they reach 20,000 people \(unique visitors\) per month and their newsletter has 13,000 people \(registered contacts\)\) \( **S9**\) and elicited a response from the Director of *Giving Evidence*, a donor consultancy organisation, who agreed with Pummer that people need moral principles to guide their charitable giving. Also drawing upon **R1\-R3**, Pummer released a video interview and followed it up with a long\-form article on his research, titled “What’s bad about being good?” This article outperformed all previous long\-forms at St Andrews in terms of early views, with clear evidence that the majority of people stayed on to read the page \( **S10**\).

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research led by Kruschwitz in the University of Essex's Natural Language and Information Processing \(NLIP\) research group demonstrated the capability for industry strength application of state of the art insights/research in Natural Language Processing \(NLP\) and Information Retrieval \(IR\). Specifically, research presented in \[G1\] led to the development of an enterprise\-level intranet search engine for real world scalable applications \[R1\] and provided insights into improving suggestions to guide users \[R2\]. This demonstrated the capability required for \[G1\] through which a new media monitoring platform \[R3\] was developed. Subsequent research \[R5, G3\] advanced it further. 

 Work on supporting field operatives for British Telecom with contextual search \[R1\] progressed enterprise search level towards performance quality comparable to mainstream Internet search engines, i.e. those able to process large quantities of information in structured mark\-up \(typically HTML, but also PDF and Microsoft Word formats\). The work in \[R1\] also provided insights into processing and indexing and then retrieving document collections residing in different data silos, which importantly, is analogous to processing a heterogeneous stream of news articles. In practice, the search engine in \[R1\] was developed and deployed for technical support staff. This ran live for several years and was accessed by the field force of the large telecommunications company. Kruschwitz et al.’s interactive adaptive query suggestion mechanism proposed \[R1\] guided users' searches through suggestions \(for words and phrases users enter into a search box to obtain a list of results\) derived from previous interactions. Further insights into generating such suggestions to enhance search, not of the whole web but smaller and more focused collections \[R2\] demonstrated: \(1\) the usefulness of log analysis to extract query modification suggestions; \(2\) a more fine\-grained approach than grouping search requests into sessions allows for extraction of better refinement terms from query log files \[R2\]. 

 Search method insights \[R1, R2\] resulted in \[G2\] by evidencing industry applicability. Research by Kruschwitz, Poesio and Martinez\-Alvarez to build a scalable architecture for automated information provision resulted in a novel information search and filtering platform \[R3\]. This aggregates, analyses and classifies news articles so that they can be matched against a client's bespoke search profile. The cloud based architecture formed by an analytics pipeline comprising: *Document Stream > Summarisation > Named Entity Recognition* \( *NER\)/* *entity recognition and disambiguation \(ERD\) > Topic Classification > De\-duplication > Clustering > Email Delivery to Client*. Each one of the 5 text analytics modules between document stream and Email delivery has a different component. Each document is processed through all the components, extending the information available for it. For instance, after the summarisation component, the system has access to the summary of the document. Near\-duplication detection addresses the problem caused by republished articles in written media. Moreover, if not considered duplicates, often there are tens or hundreds of articles focused on the same information. These are addressed using clustering and event detection mechanisms. The pipeline uses a queuing system between components, allowing them to scale independently. This characteristic provides a scalable solution while minimising the complexity of the architecture. This also allows focus on specific solutions for each one of the components in order to improve the quality of the system over time \[R3\]. This addressed information filtering systems' growing problem of information overload, in particular to obtain insights to inform strategic decision making from disparate sources. The media monitoring platform \[R3\] allowed information search, filtering and summarisation on a scale and at a speed that was previously not possible as a single business service to analyse all the news of the world in real\-time. 

 Essex NLIP researchers addressed the media monitoring platform’s next stage in development in \[G3\]. The new approach for scalable visualisation of sentiment and stance, which addressed scalable visualisation of planning data in e\-government, \[R5\] was presented to Signal AI, demonstrating capability to address the problem in \[G3\]. Moreover, the first published paper into the problem of identifying whether a news article can be identified as topical or an aggregation of different news stories \[R5\], showed that the process can be broken down into a two\-stage approach: first segment an article into smaller units, examine possible topic shifts and then apply a neural\-network\-based approach akin to image processing to identify whether the article/image resembles an aggregate or a topical piece. This advanced topic detection and filtering summary articles – key to the media monitoring system’s analytics modules. Narrow searches may exclude important information. Broader scope was exceeding existing monitoring products. Some articles, e.g., summaries should be excluded \[R2\]. Further work by Chamberlain and Brill on \[G3\] addressed turning a large feed of news articles into a digest of a small number of articles summarising and covering the key insights in those articles. They developed IR algorithms \(based on clustering and ranking\) for this \(as noted in \[S5\]\). \[text removed for publication\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Development of a novel media monitoring platform contributed to business success for MBS and the rapid expansion of Signal AI** 

 Company executives require regular, up\-to\-date news tailored to their business or sector to inform decision making. MBS Group \(MBS\), a leading global executive search and selection firm, found its manually produced newsletter was not providing the width and depth of coverage or the high quality, relevant, personalised external information required by its senior executives. \[text removed for publication\] Essex’s NLIP researchers demonstrated their research was applicable to this \[R1, R2, G1\]. Consequently, \[text removed for publication\] they began a project \[G2\] in 2013 to build the architecture required. Their resulting media monitoring platform is a state\-of\-the\-art, cloud\-based information processing architecture solution \[R3\] that not only enables scalable automation of providing tailored news but proved capable of delivering the high quality business intelligence companies demand more widely. The platform analyses world news, filtering out noise and focusing on trends and strategic information, users are provided with a structured stream of documents relevant to their business needs. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Importantly, through ongoing collaboration with Essex's NLIP researchers, the underlying technology for a new company, Signal AI, was established \[text removed for publication\]. According to Signal AI, the collaboration with the University of Essex ‘ *created tangible value for Signal AI by allowing us to bridge the academic and industrial ecosystems in a seamless way through application of the University of Essex’s research. The first project allowed us to set the foundations of our Natural Language Processing \(NLP\) pipeline, Signal AI’s platform, by working in collaboration with Prof Udo Kruschwitz and Prof Massimo Poesio to apply their NLP expertise*' \[S2\]. **The project transformed the business so significantly and led to winning in 2015 the best Knowledge Transfer Partnership award of the year** \[S3\]. Essex research was further embedded in Signal AI through Albakour becoming Data Scientist \(in 2015\) and Kruschwitz continuing as Signal AI’s Senior Advisor to ‘ *advise and guide Signal AI in all research matters*’ \[S4\]. 

 Essex’s research was an essential part of Signal’s rapid expansion. Signal AI generated its first substantial sales to several well\-known brands and organisations \[text removed for publication\]. This project *‘helped the company secure investment of over £5.8m. This played a pivotal and transformative role in the development of Signal’s AI\-powered media monitoring capabilities as well as the company’s growth’* \[S4\]. In the second Innovate UK project with the company \(started January 2019\), Signal AI worked with Kruschwitz \(until June 2019\) and, leading thereafter, Chamberlain *‘who provided his expertise and advice, based on his research at Essex, not only on NLP but also on Human Computer Interaction \(HCI\) in order to maximise the value of the new developments in our product. This project started a new product line in the company*' \[S2\]. Signal AI adds ‘ *the collaboration provided us the support to move one level higher in the value chain, looking at how to provide more strategic insights to our clients based on our data*’. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Commenting on the company’s growth, Signal AI note *‘During the course of these collaborations, Signal AI has gone from three people working in a garage to over 150 full\-time employees now based in offices in London, New York and Hong Kong’* \[S2\]. They add that Signal AI’s collaborations with the University of Essex, as well as the features delivered as a result, have been a key selling point in discussions with investors *‘Signal AI has obtained more than £50,000,000 of investment to date, with the most recent Series C funding round of almost £20,000,000 completed in 2019*’ \[S2\].  \[text removed for publication\] Signal AI developed a new feature, Signal Briefings, which provides clients with an executive level summary of a large feed of news to save time and keep clients updated with industry news \[S5, S6\]. \[text removed for publication\]. In reporting the next generation of AI technology in the Signal AI platform in February 2020, \[S6\] highlights ‘ *Signal AI, one of the leading companies transforming how business leaders make sense of the world’s information*' in 2019 *'saw unprecedented success, more than doubling its customer base, international expansion into the US and Asia Pacific, and a successful Series C funding’*. Signal conclude that ‘ *Working with Essex's natural language processing and text analytics researchers gave our start\-up the technical expertise needed to differentiate ourselves in a competitive market*' CEO, Signal \[S2\]. This collaboration ‘ *helped us drive innovation in the company*’ \[S2\]. 

 **Signal AI’s** \[text removed for publication\] **global clients benefit from the Signal media\-monitoring platform** 

 \[text removed for publication\] The Signal AI platform has gone on to change the practice of its business clients in areas such as, tracking press coverage, monitoring global news, monitoring policy change and content generation and business intelligence \[S7\]. Public relations teams use Signal AI’s platform to track news coverage of their clients, for both promotional campaigns and to monitor negative news stories for reputation management and competitor performance. The platform has enabled MBS themselves, as well as leading international law firms such as Bird and Bird and Simmons and Simmons, to save time enabling them to process more information and adding value to their business. Bird & Bird’s PR team saved over an hour a day using the platform and note “ *We have halved our annual expenditure on media monitoring, but expanded and improved the speed of our coverage tracking.*” Head of Marketing and Communications, Bird & Bird \[S7\]. Simmons and Simmons, save 4\-5 hours a month tracking news coverage, improving efficiency and enabling more information to be processed. The platform is also used to monitor enterprise\-level legal policy and law. Deloitte, the largest professional services firm in the world, report that the platform enables over 1,200 of its clients  to stay informed about changes proposed and enacted in law and regulation transforming the way they monitor and assess changes to tax law and regulation \[S7\]. 

 Beyond business, the platform is used by NGOs such as Scholars At Risk, Amnesty International and the Disasters Emergency Committee to monitor and verify reports of human rights violations, and to deliver efficient responses to global disasters \[S7\]. Scholars At Risk, an organisation, which aims to protect threatened academic scholars around the world, report a 50% reduction in time spent monitoring global news for human rights violations, potential attacks on higher education institutes and to strategically plan campaigns and advocacy. The product has measurably helped their cause ‘ *time saved is people saved*’ Senior Program Officer, Scholars At Risk \[S7\]. Amnesty International is using the platform to verify eyewitness reports of human rights violations happening globally. Within the first few weeks of using this, they were able to quickly corroborate an eyewitness video of an extrajudicial execution in Mexico by locating a local Spanish language news story. Amnesty International was then able to compile sufficient evidence to call upon the authorities to perform an independent investigation. ‘ *We were able to discover relevant news from sources we didn’t know existed*’ Head of Digital Verification Corps at Amnesty International \[S7\]. The Signal product, enables the Disasters Emergency Committee, which coordinates the delivery of efficient disaster responses in the world’s poorest countries ‘ *to have unlimited clippings during busy times without extra cost \[…\] the flexibility of controlling our media monitoring service from our desktops allows valued agility to keep up with unpredictable and fast moving crises’* CEO, Disaster Emergency Committee \[S7\]. 

 In conclusion, the CEO of Signal AI notes **' **Our partnership with the University of Essex has been long and fruitful, and it has helped shape Signal into the innovative media company it is today**.’ CEO, Signal AI** \[S2\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Tax Gap \(the difference between tax liabilities and what is actually collected\) is a major concern to government, with the UK’s being £31 billion annually and the EU\-28’s, €1 trillion. 

 **Informing UK Tax Policy:** Engaged research by the University of Exeter’s Tax Administration Research Centre \(TARC\), provided the UK body responsible for tax collection \(HMRC\), with powerful, robust confirmation of existing Tax Gap estimates for self\-employment income, additionally identifying relevant economic sectors most prone to under\-reporting, and so informing their tax gap reduction strategies. 

 **Informing International Tax Policies:** Internationally, research underpinned: \(1\) the Greek Tax Administration Authority’s decision to restructure its national tax auditing strategy \(at a cost of €160 million\); \(2\) changes to the Bulgarian National Revenue Agency’s VAT Tax Gap measurement process; \(3\) the Rwanda Revenue Agency’s re\-evaluation of its tax auditing strategy; and \(4\) strengthened the work of the prominent EU Tax Gap Project Group. Additionally, Kotsogiannis was asked to work with the International Monetary Fund to evaluate their world\-leading TADAT tool, to improve performance of tax assessment globally.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Tax Gap is the difference between the amount of tax that should, in theory, be paid, and what is actually paid.  Measurement of the Tax Gap is an important tool in helping governments to understand the relative size and nature of non\-compliance, and then to develop effective strategies aimed at reducing the gap. Better understanding and measurement of the Tax Gap is a top priority for all revenue agencies. The UK’s HMRC estimates the UK *income* Tax Gap to be in the region of £12 billion annually and in the EU\-28 it is estimated to be over €50 billion a year. Corresponding annual UK Tax Gaps relating to *all forms* of tax are estimated to be £31 billion \(UK; 4.7% of total theoretical tax liabilities\) and €1 trillion \(EU\-28\). 

 The major piece of research **\[3.1\]** underpinning this impact case study is the outcome of a longstanding close collaboration between the UK’s HMRC, and Professors Kotsogiannis and Myles of the University of Exeter Business School Tax Administration Research Centre \(TARC\). HMRC representatives sit on TARC’s Advisory Board and a PhD was delivered thorough this research \(Ana Cinta G. Cabral\). 

 The TARC/HMRC collaboration was consolidated through a research project led by Kotsogiannis \(2013\-2017\) on Tax Gap measurement, which specifically focused on the UK’s *Self\-employment Income* Tax Gap – estimated to be £1 to £2 billion annually **\[3.1\]**. The project was commissioned directly and co\-developed with the HMRC. Its aim was to contribute to improving understanding around some of the more challenging areas of tax gap estimation. The research **\[3.1\]** builds on the existing literature, which utilises the expenditure\-based methodology to measure income tax non\-compliance, and exploits the differing opportunity for under\-reporting of the two employment groups, the self\-employed and employed. 

 As income from employment is subject to ‘withholding taxes’, there are minimal possibilities for under\-reporting, and thus the income of the employed is assumed to be accurately reported. Through observing the expenditure pattern of the employed, the level of income necessary to sustain a certain level of expenditure can be ascertained. Therefore, any discrepancies between the income reported by the self\-employed and the employed, at a certain level of expenditure, can be used to elicit the extent of hidden income by the former group. A key research finding was that the discrepancy observed is due to the taxpayer’s decision to under\-report their tax liabilities, as opposed to being due to reasons related to the heterogeneous behaviour of occupational groups and the differences in their preferences, or by consumers saving and consuming differently, or error in measuring the variables of interest **\[3.1\]**. This is an important finding and innovation because, when events are studied that do not lend themselves to measurement \(as with the under\-reporting of income\), there might be several other explanations that challenge the underlying assumptions of the analysis, and could potentially bias the results, in this case, leading to a false attribution to income under\-reporting. 

 Following several robustness tests, the research **\[3.1\]**, confirms that the results are not caused by different preferences between the self\-employed and the employed. It shows that, on average, the self\-employed report only 80.4% of their true income \(or the self\-employed income\-gap is 19.6%\). Given that self\-employment income in the UK for the period of study \(2010–2012\) represented 5.5% of GDP, this translated into an estimate of unreported taxable income of 1.6% of GDP. 

 Further analysis **\[3.2\]**, carried out in collaboration with HMRC, identified the economic sectors which are contributing to the UK’s Hidden Economy \(defined as the economy operating outside formal channels\) with the highest risk of income under\-reporting. 

 The initial major piece of research **\[3.1\]** subsequently led to cooperation with a number of other national revenue authorities, including the Bulgarian National Revenue Agency \(BNRA\). With the support of the BNRA, TARC was awarded £100,000 by the Alan Turing Institute \(2018\-2020\) for the project ‘Detecting Anomalies in Networks: The Case of VAT’, which investigated Value Added Tax \(VAT\) fraud, being a component part of the Tax Gap. The project was delivered in collaboration with University College London. Insights obtained from the work with HMRC **\[3.1\]** were combined with Bulgarian administrative tax data, and resulted in a report and scientific contribution analysing how the VAT Tax Gap, resulting from fraud, can be minimised in Bulgaria **\[3.3\].** Using an algorithm, the research identified 8,000 registered traders from the Bulgarian tax base, previously categorised as low risk, that were in fact non\-compliant. 

 The initial research **\[3.1\]** was also developed to estimate the income Tax Gap in Greece in 2018 in collaboration with the Hellenic Republic’s Independent Authority for Public Revenue \(IAPR\). 

 Kotsogiannis’ continuing collaboration with UK’s HMRC’s Tax Gap team, and the new work with the BNRA **\[3.3\]**, subsequently led to the development and presentation of research which considered how revenue agencies can optimally choose the sample of tax payers to audit, with the objective of narrowing the Tax Gap **\[3.4\]**. 

 The TARC research portfolio also led to cooperation with the Rwanda Revenue Authority on an original policy report evaluating its audit strategy **\[3.5\]**. This delivered preliminary and provisional estimates of the effect of Rwanda Revenue Authority \(RRA\) audits on reporting behaviour after one and two years following the end of the whole audit process for Corporate Income Taxes \(CIT\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Better understanding and measurement of the Tax Gap is a top priority for all revenue agencies. TARC research has delivered impact to national government tax and revenue collection agencies in four different countries – the UK, Greece, Bulgaria, and Rwanda \- generated through collaborative working approaches with national agencies: UK’s HMRC, the Independent Authority for Public Revenue of the Hellenic Republic \(IAPR\), Bulgarian National Revenue Agency \(BRNA\) and Rwanda Revenue Agency \(RRA\). TARC research has **provided robust confirmation of existing estimates of Tax Gaps**; helped **identify the economic sectors which are more prone to under\-declaring their tax liabilities**; and **contributed to national reforms including the restructuring of tax auditing and planning**. The research also contributed to the international tax and revenue community through work with the prominent European Commission’s Tax Gap Project Group and through leading an influential International Monetary Fund review of their TADAT tool. 

 **Informing UK Government Tax Policy**: The underpinning research **\[3.1\]** confirmed HMRC estimates of Tax Gap magnitudes relating to self\-employed income in the UK, providing them with *“external assurance”* **\[5.1\]** and a powerful measure of the robustness of their own analytical approach. The research was the *“outcome of longstanding collaboration”* **\[5.1\],** co\-developed by TARC and the HMRC’s Tax Gap team between 2014 and 2016, along with contributions from HMRC’s Knowledge, Analytics and Investigations Team and Hidden Economy Team. It was driven by HMRC’s strategy around the validation of its approaches by obtaining alternative measurements of the UK’s Tax Gap, to deepen its understanding of that gap, and provide “ *the foundation for HMRC’s strategies which are most effective at reducing the gap*” **\[5.1\].** . 

 The TARC Programme Manager for HMRC explained: “ *Professor Kotsogiannis provided work which supported HMRC’s understanding of the self\-employed income Tax Gap. This has been a valuable contribution to HMRC. Estimating the Tax Gap…is an important tool for understanding the relative size and nature of non\-compliance.*” **\[5.1\].**  As the research also identifies ‘risky sectors’ \(i.e. those most prone to tax under\-reporting\), she further confirmed that HMRC was able to more efficiently target their auditing and tax investigation resources towards these sectors **\[5.1\]:**   *“the research developed the approach to explore under\-declaration of second/additional incomes, which are part of the moonlighting hidden economy”* and therefore *“provided valuable external insight into the key sectors in which this took place”* **\[5.1\].** Between 2014 and 2018, Kotsogiannis’ team delivered six presentations \(based on **\[3.1, 3.2\]**\) to HMRC’s Tax Gap team which *“helped to build shared understanding on the range of analytical approaches”* available to HMRC **\[5.1\].** 

 **Informing International Tax Policies** 

 **European Commission Tax Gap Project Group**: The impact of the research **\[3.1\]** was extended through Kotsogiannis being invited to present findings to the prominent Tax Gap Project Group, established under the EU’s FISCALIS 2020 programme. Coordinated by the EC’s Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union, this Group was established to pool knowledge and share experience in existing Tax Gap estimations across the EU\-28. In Nov 2015, Kotsogiannis presented to representatives of EU member states’ National Revenue Authorities working on the Tax Gap and the Hidden Economy, and the research was cited in, and contributed, to the Tax Gap Project Group’s 2016 report: ‘The Concept of Tax Gaps. Report on VAT Gap Estimations’ **\[5.2\].**

 **International Monetary Fund \(IMF\)**: As a further measure of the global significance and impact reach of TARC’s work, Kotsogiannis was approached by the IMF to work collaboratively with a team of experts, to evaluate the impact of their world\-leading TADAT tool – the International Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool. This tool assesses the speed of tax administration reforms and intends to improve performance of tax assessment globally.

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 While conservation genetics grew rapidly as a discipline from the 1990s onwards, it had little impact on real\-world conservation activity. Conservation policies and activities at best ignored genetic biodiversity, and at worst, eroded it. A Cardiff research programme to assess genetic diversity of species, monitor genetics in conservation and highlight the dangers of intentional genetic manipulation changed: 1\) the Namibian government’s national policy on selective breeding; 2\) species\-specific conservation practice for the African rhinoceros, Bojer’s Skink and Monserrat Mountain Chicken Frog; and 3\)  global standards for monitoring biodiversity for worldwide conservation efforts, including EU commitment to inclusion of genetic monitoring in their Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Genetic variation is an essential component of biodiversity and an important factor in building the resilience of populations, species and ecosystems against environmental changes. Until recently, consideration of genetic variation in biodiversity planning and conservation policy was minimal. For example, the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity \(CBD\) *Strategic Plan 2011\-2020* only focussed on genetics in one out of its twenty strategic aims. 

 A series of Cardiff ecological research studies, led by Bruford, helped address this gap. Focused on genetic analysis and biodiversity in both wild and domesticated animal species, they highlighted a complex interplay of genetics, behaviour, social structures, physical environment and human activity required for biodiversity conservation **\[3.1\]**. 

 Key research expertise, and studies, that underpinned Cardiff’s impact are outlined below: 

 **2.1 Understanding genetic risks to endangered species: key methodologies** 

 The Cardiff team’s relevant biodiversity expertise included: 

 **a. Assessing genetic diversity** to understand the extent of species loss in a range of endangered populations by analysing mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of various species and quantifying the full extent of genetic loss in wild populations. This type of analysis enables conservation actions, such as translocation of individuals to improve localised breeding which protects or improves genetic diversity at the same time as improving population numbers **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]**. 

 **b.** Compiling **genetic data to monitor populations** of conservation concern, thereby ensuring that captive populations are representative of the genetic diversity of the full wild population. This is particularly important in species at known risk from fast\-acting threats, such as the threat of chytridiomycosis to amphibians, which can decimate a population in less than a generation **\[3.1, 3.4\]**. 

 **c.** Highlighting the damaging effects of **intentional genetic manipulation** on wildlife **,** including approaches such as unregulated breeding, inbreeding, hybridisation and translocation of animals. Such practices are motivated by organisations who prioritise the desires of tourists and game hunters, rather than the best interests of species conservation **\[3.5\]**. 

 Application of Cardiff’s research methods consolidated an approach to conservation which prioritised the assessment of genetic data to inform conservation practice on the ground. 

 **2.2 Genetic analyses of endangered species** 

 Through a systematic series of collaborative research projects, Cardiff researchers brought their broader expertise in genetic analysis \(Section 2.1\) to inform understanding of the following endangered species: 

 **a. Bojer’s skink** 

 The Bojer’s skink is the only species in its genus, having diverged from its nearest living relative over 30 million years ago. It is both genetically unique and critically endangered. The Cardiff Team, led by Bruford, undertook an analysis of genetic diversity in these reptiles in their native habitat of the offshore islands of mainland Mauritius. The research discovered demographic population history and a likely origin and recommended using additional translocation from other south\-eastern islands to further genetically support the diminishing populations **\[3.3\]**. 

 **b. Montserrat Mountain Chicken Frog** 

 In a collaborative research project initiated by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Cardiff group, led by Orozco ter\-Wengel, carried out genetic analysis of a critically endangered species of frog, the Montserrat Mountain Chicken Frog, following the effects of a devastating chytridiomycosis epidemic. They characterised the range of genetic diversity within the species and discovered that populations on two separate islands share the same mitochondrial haplotype, strongly indicating that Dominican and Montserrat mountain chickens represent the same species and the same evolutionary significant unit **\[3.4\]**. 

 **c. Black rhinoceros** 

 The Cardiff team, led by Russo, worked with the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Species Survival Commission African Rhino Specialist Group to analyse the genetic structure of historic and modern rhinoceros populations using the largest sample of black rhinoceroses ever studied. Using mitochondrial and nuclear datasets, the team discovered a 69% loss of the species’ mitochondrial genetic variation, highlighting the critical need for new conservation management approaches for this species **\[3.2\]**. 

#  2.3 Establishing pathways to influence conservation policy 

 To facilitate inclusion of conservation genetics in international policymaking, Bruford led the European ConGRESS project \(€1.14M FP7 funding, 12 European partners\) **\[G3.1\]** to develop an integrated genetics policy\-making portal. The team used Cardiff’s research findings to advocate for a closer partnership between academic conservation geneticists and conservation practitioners, thereby maximising the potential of genetic analysis to support conservation efforts **\[3.6\]**. 

 Following the success of ConGRESS **\[G3.1\]**, in 2014 the IUCN established the Conservation Genetics Specialist Group \(CGSG\) as an evidence provider for conservation policymakers in its 208 member states. IUCN appointed Bruford as co\-chair, with Segelbacher \(University of Freiburg\). Additionally, Cardiff’s Russo was appointed to co\-lead the African chapter of the CGSG, while Orozco\-terWengel was appointed to co\-lead the South American CGSG. Under the Cardiff team’s leadership, CGSG worked on reports and evidence guidelines, which included Cardiff research. 

#  2.4 Describing deficiencies in the Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework 

 Upon release of the draft Post\-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework by the Convention on Biological Diversity \(of which the EU are key contributing members\), Bruford collaborated with geneticists and environmental conservation organisations to assess the efficacy of the Framework as a policy mechanism to maintain biodiversity, highlighting deficiencies with species scope. Cardiff’s research recommended that all species should be conserved rather than limiting the Framework’s remit to species of agricultural value. The research also proposed new indicators to support improved monitoring of genetic diversity of species **\[3.7\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 Since 2014, Cardiff research: 1\) led to policy change in Namibia to counter the detrimental impacts of intentional genetic manipulation on ecosystems; 2\) changed species\-specific conservation practice for the African rhinoceros, Bojer’s Skink and Monserrat Mountain Chicken Frog; and 3\) generated global standards for monitoring biodiversity, used worldwide in conservation, and influencing the proposed EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030. 

 **4.1 Combatting genetic manipulation in Namibia** 

 Trophy hunting is a multi\-million dollar industry in some Africa nations \(article in *The Conversation,* ‘Counting the contribution of hunting to South Africa’s economy’, 15 November 2018\), and creation of game animals with unnatural genetic traits, such as specific novel coat colours, has become a threat to natural biodiversity. The Namibian Government engaged with the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Conservation Genetics Specialist Group \(CGSG\) to facilitate development of a robust policy designed to stop these genetic manipulations. Based on Cardiff research **\[3.5\]**, the Namibian Government launched a National Policy on Selective and Intensive Breeding of Wildlife for Commercial Purposes **\[5.1\]** to “ *protect the long\-term viability of…wildlife populations*” **\[5.2\]**. The policy committed to **\[5.1\]**: 

-  regulate the practice of selective and intensive breeding “through development of regulations…including the registration of selectively and intensively bred animals”; 

-  manage and mitigate “environmental aspects associated with intensive and selective breeding of wildlife”; 

-  monitor “genetic integrity of the selectively and intensively bred wild animals…and to protect free roaming wildlife from potential impacts of genetic manipulation”. 

 Deputy Director of Wildlife Monitoring and Research in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia confirmed: *“The involvement of the IUCN Conservation Genetics Specialist Group via Professor Mike Bruford…and the recent publication of the article ‘Intentional Genetic Manipulation’ as a conservation threat’* **\[3.5\]**… *has played a central role in the development of our policy thinking in this arena”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.2 Species\-specific genetic conservation** 

 Through leadership of the IUCN CGSGs, and a long\-term collaboration between the Cardiff team and the Durrell Wildlife Trust, Cardiff research changed conservation management plans for the following endangered species: 

 **a. Bojer’s skink** 

 Found only in Mauritius, conservation of the Bojer’s skink was a critical priority for the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation \(MWF\). Working in conjunction with the National Parks Service of Mauritius, the MWF’s Conservation Director confirmed that Cardiff research **\[3.3\]** analysing the genetic diversity of the local population “ *supplied the evidence required to assist our conservation efforts”* **\[5.3\]**. The Foundation used the 2018 analysis **\[3.3\]** to support translocation of populations between Mauritius’ islands. This evidence helped “ *in managing the re\-establishment of the skink populations on Il de la Passe and Ile aux Fouquets”*, two islands where the native populations had significantly diminished **\[5.3\]** *.* “ *A further two skink translocations from the other islands”* were since undertaken **\[5.3\]**. 

 **b. Montserrat Mountain Chicken Frog** 

 The Durrell Wildlife Trust used Cardiff research on the genetic diversity of the Montserrat Mountain Chicken Frog **\[3.4\]** to improve their captive breeding programme. The Trust’s Head of Herpetology, notes that Cardiff’s study was the “ *first to describe the impact of the* \[chytridiomycosis\] *disease on the genetic diversity of an affected species*” **\[5.4\]**. Cardiff’s confirmation that the Trust currently held “ *a representative sample of genetic diversity from the species*” **\[5.4\]** allowed the organisation to design a new captive breeding programme which avoided the need for additional animals. The research “ *was essential in developing our captive breeding strategy for the species, excluding the need for further collections of individuals, with the focus now on maintaining the diversity already present*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 Further, having discovered that the two remaining populations of frog on Dominica and Montserrat had the same mitochondrial haplotype, the Trust consolidated their species management across the two islands: “ *Using this finding as evidence… we moved from managing the populations independently, to managing them as a single unit. This has freed up resources*” **\[5.4\]**. The Trust committed to use the insights beyond the frog population: “ *In Durrell’s wider work, this has made us more cognisant of the need for pre\-emptive action in securing genetic diversity in populations facing similar disease threats*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 **c. African rhinoceros** 

 Cardiff research on the African rhinoceros **\[3.2\]** was also highly prized by the IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group. A joint statement from the Chair and Scientific Officer of the group confirmed: “ *Our genetics education has been advanced thanks to the understandable and clear way…\[Bruford\] presented and explained the latest genetic issues and concepts \(especially to those of us rhino conservationists who are not geneticists\)*” **\[5.5\]**. Previously absent, genetic data is now used in conservation strategies for these critically endangered animals. For example, it was used to inform a decision “ *to move away from the static idea of a subspecies to the dynamic idea of populations”* **\[5.5\]**. The Africa Rhino Specialist Group committed to use the insights to “ *inform future translocation planning*”, in particular information about when genetic exchange in specific situations is and is not an optimal conservation option **\[5.5\]**. 

 **4.3 Global impact on biodiversity policy and standards** 

 **a. Global standards for monitoring genetic biodiversity** 

 Cardiff researchers partnered with the Group on Earth Observations \(GEO\), a global collaboration of 111 world governments and a further 129 ‘participating organisations’, including UNEP \(United Nations Environment Programme\). GEO uses big data to tackle some of the world’s most complex challenges in sustainable development and environmental management. Working directly with the GEO Biodiversity Observation Network initiative, the Cardiff team played a key role in the production of *The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,* a manual setting out global standards for genetic monitoring of biodiversity **\[3.1, 3.2, 5.6\]**. 

 The *Handbook* has been downloaded 251K times since its 2017 publication **\[5.7\]**. ‘Chapter 5: Monitoring Changes in Genetic Diversity’ \(co\-authored by Bruford and informed by Cardiff’s genetic conservation research **\[3.1\]**\) was cited in a UN Environment Program policy document highlighting the importance of genetic diversity “in maintaining and enhancing the diversity of cultivated plants and breeds of livestock underpinning the resilience of agricultural systems and food security” **\[5.8**, p153 **\]**. 

 **b. **EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030** 

 In January 2020, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity \(CBD\) started consultation on a draft *Post 2020 Global Framework on Biodiversity*. Bruford’s research highlighting the deficiencies of the draft Framework **\[3.7\]** also influenced the *EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030*. While finalisation of the *Global Framework* was impeded by Covid\-19, the *EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030* launched in May 2020 **\[5.9\]**. 

 The *EU Biodiversity Strategy* implements Bruford’s recommendations **\[3.7\]** to ensure a broader focus on species outside of agriculture. Moving beyond agricultural species protection, the EU Strategy further commits to “no human\-induced extinction of species” and establishes a target that “\[t\]here is a 50% reduction in the number of Red List species \[the IUCN’s species at risk of extinction\] threatened by invasive alien species” **\[5.9\]**. To achieve this, the Strategy commits that \(a\) the EU should “set up ecological corridors to prevent genetic isolation” and \(b\) each member state should “ensure no deterioration in conservation trends and status of all protected habitats and species by 2030” **\[5.9\]**. 

 In summary, Cardiff research on genetic diversity and conservation shaped policy, recommendations and engagement work of the IUCN CGSGs, a critical platform which transformed conservation policy, and practice in endangered species management, around the world.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The beneficial effects of flavonoid compounds on cardiovascular function, validated through randomised control trials led by University of Reading researchers, has underpinned the development of functional food products by two major multi\-national companies. PepsiCo has developed a new process for retaining flavanones and fruit fibre that are normally lost in the juicing process. This led to the launch of a new premium drink range, Tropicana Whole Fruit \[ *text removed for publication*\]. Early findings on the benefits of flavanols supported the development to market of CocoaVia \[ *text removed for publication*\]. Following the team’s determination of the optimum daily intake of cocoa flavanols for promoting vascular health, in 2019 Mars, Inc. increased the concentration of cocoa flavanols in CocoaVia® to 450mg per serving. Collaborative research with Mars, as part of the EU FLAVIOLA project, also led to first AOAC \(Association of Official Analytical Chemists\) method for analysing cocoa flavanols in food products, which is steering consistent product labelling across the vitamin and supplement industry.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Evidence from observational studies suggests that diets high in polyphenol\-rich foods, such as apples, blueberries, cocoa, and black tea, are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the ability to fully harness the health benefits from dietary polyphenols requires an understanding of the bioactivity of individual compounds, their optimum dose and recommended daily intake from food products. 

 Since 2004, research by Professor Jeremy Spencer and colleagues at the University of Reading has helped to define the paradigm\-changing concept of how flavonoids and other dietary polyphenols act, via non\-antioxidant mechanisms of action, to mediate clinically significant health benefits. This body of research has included studies supported by Mars, Inc and BBSRC to understand the human absorption and metabolism of dietary flavanols, providing evidence linking the intake of flavanol\-containing foods/beverages to beneficial changes in the gut microflora as well as to cognitive and vascular function \[1\]. 

##  Establishing the optimum intake of cocoa flavanols for promoting vascular health 

 Between September 2009 and February 2013, as part of the EU\-funded FLAVIOLA consortium, Spencer and colleagues determined the dose\-dependent effects of pure \(\-\)\-epicatechin \(a cocoa\-derived flavanol\) on human vascular function. This randomised, double\-blind, placebo\-controlled clinical trial in 20 people established that **significant increases in vascular function and improved blood flow occurred at intake amounts as low as 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight \(BW\)** 

 **\(\-\)\-epicatechin intake but were optimal at 1 mg/kg BW** \(hence 70mg is the optimal intake for a 70kg individual\). These data provided **further evidence that \(\-\)\-epicatechin is a causal vasoactive molecule within flavanol\-containing foods/beverages** \[2\]. 

 In further FLAVIOLA studies using a CocoaVia test product containing 73 mg \(\-\)\-epicatechin \(450mg total cocoa flavanols\) the team also demonstrated: 

1.  in a study of 42 healthy men, that \(\-\)\-epicatechin improves vascular function \(improved endothelial function in large arteries and enhanced vasodilator function in resistance arteries\) and **reduces systolic blood pressure in elderly individuals** \(n = 20\), in a similar manner to that observed in the younger individuals \(n= 22\) \[3\]. Spencer *et al*.’s findings provided clear evidence and novel insights that scientifically **underpin the** **potential of dietary cocoa flavanols to reverse, or at least to attenuate, features of circulatory dysfunction associated with vascular ageing in healthy men**, a major contributor to atherogenic risk independent of age. 

1.  that male and female vascular responses to cocoa flavanol intake were statistically similar \(in a randomised, controlled trial \(RCT\) in 100 healthy men and women aged 35\-60 years\) \[4\]. 

1.  that substantial interactions between cocoa flavanols and methylxanthines such as caffeine and theobromine \(which were also present in the test product\) occur during absorption; the methylxanthines mediate an increased plasma concentration of \(\-\)\-epicatechin metabolites \(up to 37% higher than from cocoa flavanols alone\). This coincides with enhanced vascular effects commonly ascribed to cocoa flavanol intake \(evidence from four RCTs in 47 healthy volunteers which measured flow\-mediated vasodilation, brachial pulse wave velocity, circulating angiogenic cells and blood pressure\) \[5\]. 

 Spencer and Kuhnle also addressed a key challenge of attaining an accurate measurement of flavanol concentration in blood after eating. They established a new protocol which minimised the loss or degradation of flavanols and metabolites during sample preparation \[6\]. This work was validated across the FLAVIOLA consortium through inter\-laboratory ring trials and was successfully employed to analyse the large number of samples that emanated from FLAVIOLA activities. 

##  Demonstrating the health benefits of flavanone\-rich orange juice 

 Research at Reading showed **for the first time that dietary flavanones \(found in citrus fruits\) are capable of counteracting transient impairments in vascular function induced postprandially** by a double meal challenge \[7\]. In a randomised, controlled, double\-masked, cross\-over intervention study in 28 healthy middle\-aged men, improvements in vascular function coincided with the peak of naringenin/hesperetin metabolites in the circulation \(7h\) following the consumption of flavanone\-containing beverages \(flavanone\-rich orange juice and homogenised whole orange\). Sustained levels of plasma nitrite indicated that citrus flavanones are effective at counteracting the negative impact of a sequential double meal on human vascular function, potentially through the actions of flavanone metabolites on nitric oxide. 

 The flavanone content of standard orange juice is lower than in whole fruit: flavanones are removed during the juicing process along with pomace – the \(edible\) fibrous component of orange segment walls. In additional RCTs, Spencer and colleagues found that the addition of pomace to orange juice elicited a significantly beneficial effect on blood glucose and insulin responses after sequential meals in men with moderate cardiometabolic risk factors \[8\]. They postulated that the high levels of polyphenols in pomace may have contributed to the observed postprandial responses, along with higher levels of soluble fibre in pomace \(compared to whole fruit\), which they suggested may have slowed stomach emptying and thereby contributed to enhanced satiety.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Research led by Spencer *et al.* to better understand how dietary flavonoids can mediate clinically significant health benefits has underpinned the development of two functional food products by two leading multinational food and drink companies. 

##  PepsiCo develops and commercialises Tropicana Whole Fruit 

 Collaborative research between PepsiCo and the University of Reading, to understand the physiological impact of flavanone\-rich, high\-fibre pomace and juice consumption, was used as justification by PepsiCo for three additional clinical studies \[ *text removed for publication*\]. “ *Ultimately, University of Reading research contributed to a body of research demonstrating that orange pomace is a dietary fiber with functionality in glycemic control, satiety, and digestive health. This nutrition science research was instrumental in driving a commitment to R&D investment and business innovation using fruit pomace.”*  Principal Scientist, PepsiCo USA \[E1\]. 

 As a result, PepsiCo installed new equipment \[ *text removed for publication*\] to develop and commercialize a proprietary enzyme\-treated pomace ingredient, and numerous patent applications have been filed to protect PepsiCo’s method for producing pomace with an improved sensory and nutritional profile \(e.g. US20200236976A1, and \[E2\]\). *“This was a significant and first\-of\-its\-kind innovation for Tropicana to be able to add more nutritional value to the daily diet of juice drinks with a functional dietary fibre from the fruit itself.” * Principal Scientist, PepsiCo USA. 

 Tropicana Whole Fruit, consisting of both apple and orange drinks, was launched in May 2019. The new range was viewed by PepsiCo as a premium addition to the brand, and not merely a line extension, as evidenced by the 83% higher price \(GBP 0.44 per 100ml\) compared to standard Tropicana orange and apple juice products \(GBP 0.24 per 100ml, November 2019 prices\). \[ *text removed for publication*\] \[E3\]. 

 Tropicana Whole Fruit products contained 150% more fibre than standard Tropicana orange and apple juices, when compared in November 2019 \[E4\]. A single portion of Whole Fruit juice \(both orange and apple\) contained 2.3g fibre, equating to 7.6% of UK recommended average intake. Only 30% of UK adults and approximately 10% of 11–18\-year\-olds meet the ‘5\-a\-day’ recommendation for fruit and vegetables \(Public Health England, 2019\). This is a public health concern: diets low in the essential nutrients \(vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre\) as well as polyphenols provided by fruit and vegetables are at higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as CVD and diabetes. The Tropicana Whole Fruit range was developed with this concern in mind, appealing to health conscious but time\-poor consumers. *“Some of the reasons people give for not eating enough fruit and veg include lack of convenience and messiness,” … “This is especially true of people living an on\-the\-go lifestyle. The Whole Fruit range seeks to break that down – by packaging up more of the whole fruit in an easy to consume 150ml format”.* Marketing Manager for juices at PepsiCo UK \[E5\]. 

##  Mars, Inc. reformulates CocoaVia® with higher flavanol content 

 Initial flavanol research conducted at the University of Reading, which demonstrated the beneficial changes to the gut microflora from consumption of flavanols as well as improvements to cognitive and vascular function, supported the market launch of the CocoaVia® dietary supplement in 2010. The original product formulation contained 250mg total cocoa flavanols/30mg of \(\-\)\-epicatechin per serving. Further collaborative research with Mars, Inc., led by Spencer as part of the EU FLAVIOLA project, showed that this flavanol concentration was below the active amount required for a physiologically beneficial effect. As a result, Mars, Inc. reformulated CocoaVia® to contain 450mg of total flavanols and 73mg of \(\-\)\-epicatechin per serving, which was in line with the intake range demonstrated by Spencer and colleagues to increase vascular function. Furthermore, scientific evidence on the benefits of cocoa flavanols is highlighted on the ‘See the Science’ page of the CocoaVia® website with Reading research providing eight of the 30 papers cited. On the benefits of heart health specifically, two of the three scientific papers cited are from Reading research \[3\],\[4\], \[E8\]. Since 2016, CocoaVia’s product packaging has also highlighted the role of cocoa flavanols in promoting healthy blood flow \[E6\]. 

 The reformulated 450mg product has been on sale to US consumers since August 2019. Sales data for the 450mg product was not available \[ *text removed for publication*\] \[E7\]. 

##  Enabling accurate flavanol analysis across the food industry 

 Spencer and Kuhnle’s analytical expertise and validated protocol for measuring flavanol intake in biological samples underpinned a collaborative study, with Mars, Inc scientists, that resulted in the first AOAC\-accredited method \(2012.24\) for the analysis of cocoa flavanols and procyanidins in food products \[E9, Robbins 2013\]. In August 2020, the AOAC adopted a new method of analysis \(2020.05\) which ‘revised and expanded’ this previous methodology, on which Mars commented: *“This opens the door for consistent product labelling, ultimately empowering consumers by providing them reliable information to compare products, which is particularly important given the wide variability in flavanol content that exists in the marketplace today,”* \[E10\]. Independent laboratory analysis confirmed that CocoaVia® contained the highest level of flavanols of any supplement on the market in 2020 \[E8\]. 

 **Summary:** Evidence from clinical trials conducted by Spencer and colleagues has underpinned the development and launch of the Whole Fruit drink range by PepsiCo, which contained higher amounts of a functional dietary fibre compared to standard juice products, and the reformulation of a Mars, Inc dietary supplement to include higher levels of flavanols to boost vascular function. The team’s expertise and protocol has also underpinned the first AOAC\-accredited method for the analysis of cocoa flavanols and procyanidins in food products, enabling consistent food labelling across products to aid consumer choice.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Public services must meet the challenge of supporting older people who live with diseases and disabilities to continue living independently for as long as possible. One way to do this is to integrate health and care services with housing. Northumbria University researchers have focussed on these integration processes and identified that, to be successful, services needed to identify and respond to issues early, upskill housing staff, and create pathways for integrated working across services. This research led to three key impacts. 1\) New models of integrated services for older people were created that have resulted in reduced hospital admissions in North Tyneside and enable older people to live in their own homes for longer, thereby reducing the cost of care. 2\) The approach has led to a collaboration with master planners and policy makers to shape the design of housing developments that aim to support independent ageing\-in\-place. 3\) The research was used by The Centre for Ageing Better to lobby the UK Government for better funding of the Disabled Facilities Grant \(funding home adaptations\), helping drive subsequent budget increases of GBP92,000,000 between 2018\-2020, taking annual funding to GBP505,000,000.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the current national policy and practice landscape, the integration of housing services with health and care sector services, to best support people to remain independent in their own home as they age, is often overlooked. Professor Glenda Cook and her team addressed the problem of lack of integration processes through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership between North Tyneside Council \(NTC\) and Northumbria University from 2011 to 2015 \(KTP 8717, \[ **G1**\]\). The KTP focussed on the delivery of the Council’s sheltered housing services for older people. This began with a mixed methods Health Needs Assessment \(HNA\) of 978 sheltered housing tenants \[ **R1**\], which then formed the evidence base for pilot service improvement initiatives, designed and evaluated by the research team \[ **R2**, **R3**\]. 

 The HNA used a parallel three strand mixed methods design, including an exploration of tenants’ perspectives, analysis of routinely collected data in the sheltered housing service and hospital admission data. This was used to identify conditions that typically result in high hospital emergency rates for tenants \(such as exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or injurious falls\) and to design preventative interventions that may reduce such non\-elective admissions \[ **R1**\]. These interventions included the introduction of a pilot telehealth service, whereby tenants can have direct access to a health care professional. A qualitative case study evaluation of this pilot, specifically focussed on respiratory conditions, highlighted requirements for workforce development and the feasibility of this service operating across sheltered housing and health service boundaries \[ **R2**\]. Further interventions included a process for routine collection of falls data and the development of a “healthy living falls prevention programme”. The successful evaluation of the pilot programme led to this becoming integral to North Tyneside’s community falls service and falls pathway \[ **R3**\]. In addition, new housing health and care referral and treatment pathways have been developed, one of which enables older sheltered housing tenants to be referred directly from sheltered housing services to multidisciplinary community NHS services within 2 hours, often avoiding hospital admission altogether \[ **R3**\]. 

 Following the success of service development and horizontal service integration based in sheltered housing, a new health\-focused service – Safe and Healthy Homes \(SHH\) – was embedded in the Local Authority’s housing service across all forms of housing and tenures \[ **R4**\]. The SHH service replicated the referral and treatment pathways that had been designed and evaluated by the team for the sheltered housing study \[ **R3**\]. This new service allowed for \(self\)\-referrals of older and disabled people living in all forms of housing and all tenures if they considered that a housing need \(such as mould and damp\) was affecting their health. Northumbria researchers undertook a qualitative exploration of experiences and outcomes, through in\-depth semi\-structured interviews with 15 householders. The findings confirmed the importance of SHH officers performing ‘facework’ to provide a trusted source of guidance to help householders navigate through the complex systems of assistance in order to receive an integrated programme of housing, health and care interventions \[ **R4**\]. 

 More recently, innovative research featuring phenomenological interviews \(N=30\) and wearable cameras has been carried out with local authorities to ensure their home adaptation services have taken a similarly holistic approach to supporting older people to remain in their homes. This can be achieved by identifying improvements in key services, from funding support to product design \[ **R5**\]. In addition, the team gathered the views of 41 older people on self\-contained housing developments providing facilities, care and support, and age\-friendly accommodation \(referred to as integrated villages\) using Q methodology, which is a process allowing the systematic appraisal and ranking of people’s views on key features \[ **R6**\]. The findings provided a unique insight into the views and orientation of older people regarding the relative attractiveness of features of specialist housing. Whilst the provision of good care was important, the study also highlighted the diversity of older people’s needs and wishes, as well as the fact that they valued attractive and practical features too, such as gardens and transport links and the potential for social interaction \[ **R6**\]. These insights have informed local authorities’ housing plans and those of a housing consortium, which successfully secured planning permission and initial development of an accredited ‘garden village’.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research has led to three key impacts. 1\) It has created and rolled\-out integrated service pathways between health, social care and housing for older people in sheltered and general housing, resulting in improved outcomes, including enabling older people to live independently in their own homes \[ **E1**, **E2**\]. 2\) It has contributed to securing outline planning permission for a national test\-bed garden village in County Durham. The approved scheme has underpinning principles of integrated health and social care to support householders to age\-in\-place and to optimise their wellbeing through prevention and enablement \[ **E3**, **E4**\]. 3\) The research has also directly informed housing policy on a regional level in relation to integrated older people’s health and care services and housing across the combined authority of North of Tyne \(population \~820,000 \[20% 65\+\], ONS 2020\) \[ **E5**\] and contributed to national policy debates on housing for older people \[ **E6**, p73\]. 

 **4.1 Integrated care practice improvements: Sheltered and private housing** 

 The KTP with NTC was graded as ‘outstanding’ and recognised by awards from a number of regional and national bodies \[ **E1**\]. It established new procedures for data collection and analysis \[ **R1**, **R3**\] which have underpinned the roll\-out of three integrated housing, health and social care service improvements. The first enabled direct referral of tenants from NTC’s sheltered housing officers to NHS community multidisciplinary teams. This resulted in older tenants being treated in their own homes within 2 hours instead of having to access NHS primary care or experience long waits for treatment by emergency services. In 2014, analysis of this new care pathway was shown to lead to a 60% reduction in non\-elective admission to hospital and treatment by primary care \[ **E1**\]. This success meant that the service, which began in three sites, has been extended and made standard across all of the Borough’s service \(26 sites\). 

 In recognition of the high incidence of falls by sheltered housing tenants, identified through the HNA \[ **R1**\], the “healthy living falls prevention programme” was the second improvement established during the KTP. This has been delivered in sheltered housing schemes by NHS professionals, leading to improvements in balance and gait, which result in improved wellbeing \[ **E7**\]. As a consequence, this programme is now integral to the North Tyneside’s multisector falls pathway \[ **E1**, **E8**\]. 

 These innovative approaches to integrating health and care services with housing to address falls within the older population have led to the development of a third service. Eleanor Binks, Senior Manager \(Integration, Transformation and Social Care, NTC\), stated *‘Involvement in the NTC/NU KTP influenced the decision to collaborate with North East Ambulance service…\[in piloting\]…an alternative response to ambulance in the event of a non\-injurious fall*’ \[ **E1**\].  Consequently, NTC now collaborates with the North East Ambulance service, with North Tyneside’s Care Call service responding to calls that are triaged through the 111/999 system as ‘non\-injurious falls’ \(46% of all calls for patients over 65 who have fallen\). This alternative response service has reduced ‘long\-lies’ and has, in turn, led to an 83% reduction in admission to hospital for non\-injurious fallers over 65 \[ **E1**, **E8**\]. In 2018, this alternative response to ambulance service received recognition in the MJ \(Municipal Journal, the management journal for local authority business\) Achievement Awards \[ **E1**, **E8**\] and has subsequently been rolled out to five localities in Northern England \[ **E1**\] \(County Durham \[excluding Darlington\], Gateshead, Hartlepool, Newcastle, Stockton\-on\-Tees and Sunderland\). These collective approaches to early intervention enable older people to live independently in their own homes rather than move to long term care environments. By 2015 the KTP\-driven changes in service delivery led to an estimated cost saving of GBP620,018 from the public services budget for long term care, and maximising of rental income to NTC through tenants remaining in their sheltered housing accommodation \[ **E9**, p5\]. 

 The KTP research demonstrated how early intervention and integrated care services can help reduce urgent and emergency admission to hospital and improve outcomes. In response, and building on the sheltered housing referral pathways, a Safe and Healthy Homes \(SHH\) service was established in 2015 for older and disabled residents living in private housing \[ **E1**, **E2**\]. This new service adopted the core principles of integrated health, care services and housing that were produced during the KTP. This facilitated home improvements for those with housing issues exacerbating or causing health problems, as well as providing rehabilitation and early interventions by health and care services \[ **E1**\]. 

 SHH is available across North Tyneside to older and disabled people, and during the period 2014\-2019 an estimated 2.2% of households in the Borough used the service \(N=1,855\) \[ **E1**\]. The service addressed health\-related housing issues such as cold \(22%\), damp and mould \(18%\), the removal of home hazards \(38%\) or electrical or heating issues \(26%\) \[ **E1**, **E2**\]. As well as home improvements, SHH staff also refer to a range of health and wellbeing services resulting in transformational living conditions for some clients: 

 ‘*Ms F’s concerns about falls and cold have been reduced, and she now has more opportunity to engage in the community and become more active. In her review questionnaire, the client claimed that she had felt suicidal before the team’s involvement and stated that her Safe and Healthy Homes Officer saved her life’* \[ **E7**, p11\]. 

 SHH interventions are estimated to have prevented falls for 18% of people referred to the service \[ **E1**\]. 

 **4.2 Impact on alternative housing options for older people** 

 Those involved with housing planning have not traditionally worked in collaboration with health and social care services during planning applications. IDpartnership \(architect\) and Plan B \(social housing consortium\) drew on the outcomes of the KTP and learning from the pilot interventions and research to include prevention and enablement features and services in the design of a village outline planning application \(South Seaham\) \[ **E3**, p54, p72; **E4**\]. The proposed 1,500\-household village includes: a health and wellbeing hub, with the potential to link the village digitally with primary and community care services; indoor/outdoor space and walkways to promote physical activity to reduce falls; 5G on\-site to support use of telehealthcare and the inclusion of adaptable homes. 

 Outline planning permission was obtained from Durham County Council in November 2018 for South Seaham, and it was also granted ‘Garden Village’ status by the Government in 2019 \[ **E3**, **E4**\]. Since outline planning was granted, Northumbria researchers have worked with the master planners to embed the principles of integration of housing with health and care in this village. Funding has been secured from the Innovate UK healthy ageing catalyst to co\-design \(with older people, health and care professionals\) seven experimental homes to provide prototypes of adaptable, connected \(with health and care services\) homes, for future development in the village. Northumbria researchers continue to work with the master planners to embed the principles of integration of housing with health and care in this village, with construction due to start in 2021 \[ **E4**\]. 

 **4.3 Impact on public policy** 

 The North of Tyne devolved authority is a partnership of three local authorities: Newcastle, North Tyneside, and Northumberland. The Combined Authority Housing and Land Board seeks to drive forward the accelerated delivery of new homes to improve the housing offer in the North of Tyne area. The KTP outcomes were cited as evidence for integrated housing, health and care within the accelerated delivery model, and have informed the Innovation Plan for the Combined Authority with respect to housing for an ageing population \[ **E5**, p16, p23, p59\]. 

 The Centre for Ageing Better creates change in policy and practice informed by evidence, working with partner organisations across England. It aims to improve employment, housing, health and communities as part of the Government’s “What Works Network”. The Centre drew on Northumbria research \[ **R5**\] as part of their evidence that increased central spending on the disabled facilities grant by GBP55,000,000 from 2017/19 and a further 8% \[ **E10**\] \(GBP37,000,000\) to a final total of GBP505,000,000 in 2019/20. The additional funds have enabled councils across the UK to invest in home adaptations for older and disabled people \(e.g., GBP500,000 in Milton Keynes\) \[ **E10**\]. Northumbria’s research was also cited as evidence in a House of Commons report on housing for older people \[ **E6**, p73\]. 

 While the initial KTP research was focused in one locality in sheltered housing services, the underlying principles have led to new ideas that have had a direct impact on the services that older people, living in all tenures of housing, can now access across the region. Subsequently this has expanded into the policy and practice of housing developers, influencing how they work with health and care services, and also steering housing policy makers in how they serve the needs of this population \[ **E4**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Every week, millions of people experience romantic breakups. The near\-ubiquitous presence of social media in contemporary life opens up new avenues for individuals to monitor or be exposed to their ex\-partners activities. Dr Tara Marshall’s research on online behaviour during relationships and after breakups indicated that post\-breakup monitoring of an ex\-partner is linked with negative personal growth and post\-breakup adjustment. As a direct result of this research, Facebook introduced a new feature which allows users to “See Less” of an ex\-romantic partner following a breakup. Within the first 6 months of piloting this feature with approximately 8,000,000 Facebook users, over 3,000,000 had engaged with the feature in some way. It has since been rolled out internationally, making it available to over 2,700,000,000 active users. Consequently, this feature, which has the potential to make Facebook more compassionate by ameliorating negative outcomes and promoting emotional recovery in the immediate aftermath of a breakup, has extraordinary reach.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Tara Marshall’s research has contributed to understanding how social networking platforms are used to maintain relationships and the potential barriers of social networking sites to personal growth following a breakup \(R1\-3\). 

 Dr Marshall’s research extended previous findings by investigating the manifestation of attachment\-dynamics in a novel context: social networking sites, which are ubiquitous and differ from traditional contexts due to the ease, anonymity, and low\-risk of detection with which one can engage in covert observation and surveillance. For example, Dr Marshall’s research suggests that, within a romantic relationship, attachment anxiety and avoidance predict levels of Facebook–related jealousy and surveillance \(R1\). Attachment orientations are a core aspect of personality which shape how individuals engage in relationships. Secure individuals believe they are worthy of love and others can be relied upon or trusted. Anxious individuals fear rejection and may be preoccupied with fears of abandonment because they do not have a positive model of self; they may engage in hyperactivating strategies to avoid rejection and abandonment by their romantic partner. Avoidant individuals strive for emotional independence and report low trust of others. Dr Marshall’s research indicated that anxious individuals reported increased Facebook\-jealousy and surveillance; higher jealousy and surveillance were explained in part due to anxious individuals’ decreased trust in their partners. Indeed, anxious individuals checked their partners’ Facebook pages more frequently, in part due to their increased Facebook\-jealousy. Conversely, avoidant individuals avoided looking at their partners’ Facebook pages. Thus, Dr Marshall’s research indicates that Facebook is an additional method through which individuals high in anxiety can surveil their partner. There are also implications for the importance of Facebook in relationship maintenance, as Facebook surveillance was also prevalent in more passionate and committed partners; this may be because individuals find looking at their partners’ page rewarding and use it as symbolic proximity seeking. 

 Crucially, Dr Marshall has also investigated the role of social networking sites in the aftermath of a romantic breakup \(R2; R3\). Dr Marshall’s research indicates that monitoring of an ex\-partner’s online activities such as their Facebook page or friends lists, which are available functions *even if* one is no longer friends, is a barrier to personal growth and is linked with greater post\-breakup adjustment, including breakup distress, negative feelings, and longing for an ex\-partner. Although remaining Facebook friends with an ex\-partner was linked with less negative feelings and longing, it was also associated with lower personal growth \(R2\). Thus, as remaining Facebook friends with an ex\-partner is likely to expose individuals to updates about their ex\-partners separate lives, individuals may find it difficult to engage in making meaning of the breakup and constructing a personal growth narrative to move on. In other words, exposure to an ex\-partner via Facebook may obstruct personal growth and prevent people from moving on after a relationship breakup. These effects may be particularly pronounced in anxious individuals \(R3\). Anxious individuals report greater breakup distress, which may serve as a catalyst for greater personal growth at a later time. This association is in part explained by greater reflection and brooding. Dr Marshall’s research highlights that those individuals who might experience the most breakup distress may, in turn, report great personal growth; however, Facebook surveillance may impede the process of reflecting on a breakup and building personal\-growth narratives \(R3\). 

 In sum, Dr Marshall’s research has allowed us to develop an understanding of how social networking sites can buffer or impede individual personal growth and post\-breakup adjustment following relationship dissolution, as a result of the ease with which information and updates about ex\-partners can be retrieved.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 With more than 2,700,000,000 active users and an annual revenue of USD70,700,000,000, equivalent to GBP51,548,430,500 \(01\-2021\), Facebook is currently the world's most popular social networking site. In addition to using the network to keep in touch with friends and family, it plays an important role in many romantic relationships. Not only do people use Facebook to keep in touch with, and monitor the activities of, current romantic partners, but as many as 900,000,000 people use Facebook to keep tabs on former romantic partners. 

 Dr Marshall’s research on the links between Facebook usage and personal growth following break\-ups directly informed the development of new features by Facebook, that allow people to modify how they receive information about former romantic partners after a relationship breakup. Specifically, Dr Marshall’s research underpinned the introduction of the “See Less” feature in October 2015. This feature allows users to opt to see less of a former partner's name and profile picture around Facebook without having to unfriend or block them. When activated, it means that a former partner’s posts will not show up in users’ News Feed and their name will not be suggested when people write a new message or tag friends in photos. The feature also allows users to limit what their former partner sees of their posts on Facebook, and gives the option for people to edit who can see past posts with their former partner. The Facebook Compassion Team described the development of this feature \(and Dr Marshall’s contribution to its development\) on their blog in November 2015: “For this product…we also devoured academic research detailing peoples' experiences after a breakup, including Tara Marshall's work about Facebook surveillance of former romantic partners” \(E1\). In a testimonial from Facebook, they state that: “The Facebook Compassion team builds products to help ease the experience of difficult life moments online. In 2015 one of our areas of focus was romantic breakups, and our work was heavily informed by Tara Marshall’s 2012 work, ""Facebook Surveillance of Former Romantic Partners: Associations with Post\-Breakup Recovery And Personal Growth.” This work was considered a “100% must read” by our team, and heavily informed our decision to build a new feature entitled “See Less.” This feature allows someone to stop seeing updates in their News Feed and elsewhere on Facebook without having to remove them as a friend. Our intention is that it serves two of the needs Tara identified — it helps reduce surveillance by not sharing content about the former partner in an unplanned way, but gives the person access to the former partner’s content on their own terms \(by navigating to the profile\). We deeply appreciate that Tara choose to research in this area — it had very tactical application in our product design.” \(E2\) 

 The feature was initially rolled out for testing with 5% of Facebook users, equivalent to 135,000,000 people, in the USA in October 2015. By March 2016, over 3,000,000 users had engaged with some aspect of the break\-up flow that contained the See Less feature \(E3\). Since then, the feature has been rolled out worldwide \(E4\). 

 Facebook has more than 2,700,000,000 active users globally – and Facebook noted that millions of people break up on their site weekly \(E1\) – so the impact of this research has <ins>extraordinary</ins> reach. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people’s lives have been affected by this work.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Worldwide clinical trials are the mechanism by which the safety and effectiveness of medicines and interventions are assessed. Mathematicians from the University of Liverpool discovered a systemic problem with outcome selection and reporting bias across the entire clinical trials sector and established the COMET Initiative \( **C**ore **O**utcome **M**easures in **E**ffectiveness **T**rials\) in response, generating key policy and societal impacts. COMET is now the international standard for harmonising outcomes \- making decisions about treatments more robust by ensuring that effectiveness data can be compared and combined, and making trials relevant to patients. COMET has transformed patient participation in outcome\-setting during the REF period from 16% to 93%. Endorsed by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\), COMET is being used by ten healthcare decision\-making organisations including guideline developers such as NICE, and trial funders including the NIHR and the pharmaceutical industry.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Results from clinical trials guide treatment decisions for patients and health professionals and are needed for licensing new medicines. Clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluating treatments such as drugs, procedures or psychological interventions, by comparing relative effects on health outcomes. ‘Outcomes’ are what is measured in participants to assess the effect of an intervention. Thousands of different outcomes may be identified across many different diseases and conditions. University of Liverpool mathematicians retrospectively analysed clinical trial data and uncovered i\) a lack of consistency in outcomes selected for measurement across trials for particular conditions, and ii\) subsequent selective reporting of outcome results in a biased way. These two issues make comparing and combining trial data difficult. 

 The rigorous study of and statistical adjustment for the detrimental effects of poor outcome selection and reporting bias within individual clinical trials originated in 2000 by Prof Paula Williamson, then a senior lecturer in the Division of Statistics and Operational Research, Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Liverpool. Prof Williamson initiated work with Prof Jane Hutton \(Newcastle University\) to establish the potential consequences of selective outcome reporting bias in clinical trials and to propose statistical methods to assess the robustness of a trial to this problem **\[3.1\]**. Prof Williamson also investigated this issue of within\-study selective reporting bias more generally at the time, recruiting statistician Dr Seokyung Hahn to Liverpool to work with her and Liverpool’s pure mathematician E. Victor Flynn and Cochrane Editor Prof Paul Garner \(Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine\) on the selective reporting of patient subgroup analysis within clinical studies **\[3.2\]**. Researchers from this same group published the first cohort study to evaluate the extent of within\-study selective reporting, identifying that the problem of reporting bias they had uncovered could be significant **\[3.3\]**. 

 In 2002, Prof Williamson established a new Centre for Medical Statistics and Health Evaluation \(now the Department of Biostatistics\) at Liverpool, with promotion to Reader and then Professor in 2005. Her continuing work in this centre provided empirical evidence for the widespread existence of outcome reporting bias specifically, estimating the prevalence and impact in systematic reviews and more recently developing preventative initiatives and statistical approaches to adjust for this bias. This whole corpus of research was based on the initial insights detailed in **\[3.1\-3\]**. A small selection of the many publications arising from the initial research into these biases are listed below **\[3.4, 3.5\]**. 

 In summary, **references \[3.1, 3.2, 3.4\] represent the body of underpinning statistics research** that established the problem and potential consequences of outcome selection and reporting bias. **\[3.3, 3.5\]** represent research on the scale of the problem, with **\[3.5\]** cited in the New York Times as ‘ *empirical evidence that the biases are widespread*’ \(Carroll, AE.  [*Congratulations. Your study went nowhere*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/upshot/publication-bias-threat-to-science.html) New York Times, 24<sup>th</sup> Sep. 2018\). 

 These findings motivated Prof Williamson to found the COMET Initiative \( **C**ore **O**utcome **M**easures in **E**ffectiveness **T**rials\), launched by the University of Liverpool in 2010 to improve the consistency of outcome selection and reporting across the whole clinical trials sector. In 2014 a Liverpool\-led systematic review populated the COMET database with all available **C**ore **O**utcome **S**ets \(COS\) **\[3.6\]**. This has since been updated six times \(annually\) to ensure COMET remains current. COMET is a global first in bringing COS together, where each COS defines a minimum agreed set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials for a particular condition. 

 Prof Williamson was the overall Principal Investigator on grants from the MRC \(MR/J004847/1 and MR/K025635/1\) and the European Commission FP7 \(305081\) that funded the set up and establishment of COMET, totalling GBP2,891,413.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 This body of research conducted by mathematicians at the University of Liverpool exposed fundamental problems with bias in outcome selection and reporting across the global multibillion \(US\) dollar clinical trials sector **\[3.1\-5\]**. Accordingly, Prof Williamson launched the COMET Initiative \( **C**ore **O**utcome **M**easures in **E**ffectiveness **T**rials\) at Liverpool in January 2010, the COMET website in 2011 and populated the open access COMET database in 2014, to introduce standardisation of outcomes in clinical trials **\[5.1\]**. Standardisation is vital for ensuring results from different trials can be compared, combined and made relevant to patients for better informed decisions about treatments, and to robustly establish which treatments work. 

 The COMET database brings together 722 minimum outcome sets **\[5.1a\]** that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials for particular conditions \( **C**ore **O**utcome **S**ets – COS\) in a dedicated and unique global repository. Since August 2013, with Prof Williamson as Chair **\[5.1b\]**, COMET has been adopted by at least ten key healthcare decision\-making organisations **\[5.2, 5.3, 5.4a, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7a, 5.7d\-f, 5.8\]**, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) and other regulators, funders and pharmaceutical companies in the UK, Europe and the US, and has transformed public participation in outcome\-setting **\[5.1c\]**. These societal **\[4.1\]** and policy impacts **\[4.2\-5\]** are described below. 

###  4.1. Establishing patient involvement 

 Up to August 2013 only 16% \(31/198\) of all published COS involved the public **\[3.6\]**, rising to 93% \(303/325\) of all COS in development by October 2020 **\[5.1c\]**. The Irish Neonatal Health Alliance charity explains how the COMET Initiative has been ‘ *instrumental in ensuring COS embody outcomes that matter most to patients*’ **\[5.9\]**. Through its People and Patient Participation group, COMET has established a patient voice in COS development that did not previously exist, and made this standard practice across the clinical trials sector. Mechanisms include a video animation explaining COS first published March 2018, translated by request into twelve languages **\[5.1d\]**. Global pharmaceutical company UCB Pharma Ltd uses COMET’s resources to explain COS to their patient partners **\[5.8\]**. A patient participant with diabetes describes feeling ‘ *empowered*’, and having his opinions valued as ‘ *simply amazing*’ **\[5.1e\]**. 

###  4.2. Making clinical guidelines more robust 

 COMET is improving recommendations for clinical practice. Since 2014, NICE has incorporated COMET into its clinical guidelines **\[5.2a,b\]**. NICE has since developed and published more than 150 clinical guidelines which health professionals in England must take fully into account. NICE describes COMET as ‘ *an excellent resource for NICE guideline developers to check whether there is a COS relevant to a guideline they are developing*’ **\[5.2a\]**. NICE also uses COMET to trigger guideline updates \(since 2016\) **\[5.2a\]**, in digital health technologies guidance \(2019\) **\[5.2c\]**, and in guidance for the life sciences industry developing medicines for COVID\-19, in which the use of COMET is ‘ *strongly recommended*’ \(2020\) **\[5.2d\]**. NICE explains how ’ *COMET is establishing consistency in outcome selection across COVID\-19 clinical trials, meaning that urgently\-needed trial data can easily be combined and compared for robust decision\-making about the best possible treatments for COVID\-19’* **\[5.2a\]**. NICE also uses COMET to identify outcomes for use in NICE Quality Standards, helping to ensure measures that ‘ *matter most for patients and service users’* **\[5.2a\]**. 

 Overall, NICE values COMET’s ‘ *commendable achievements in improving the robustness of assessment of health care interventions for clinical guidelines in England’* **\[5.2a\]**. 

 The equivalent of NICE in Sweden, the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services \(SBU\) cites inconsistent outcomes as ‘ *…one of the most common reasons clinical trial results cannot be combined, leading to inconclusive evidence for effectiveness…* *Resulting guideline recommendations lack clarity and robustness, which increases variability in clinical decision\-making and patient access to the best possible treatments.’* **\[5.3\]**. Since 2019 SBU has used COMET to check for COS in production of approximately 15 assessments annually **\[5.3\]**. SBU recognises how COMET has ‘ *successfully spread the usefulness of COS to key stakeholders such as researchers, HTA* \[Health Technology Assessment\] *organisations, funders and patient organisations*’, describing the COMET database as ‘ *the internationally accepted tool for easy access to COS and is therefore a critical resource for guideline developers’* **\[5.3\]**. 

###  4.3. Required by regulators 

 The UK Health Research Authority best practice guidance for clinical trial design sets out ‘ *an expectation that the core outcomes will be collected and reported’* using COMET **\[5.4a\]**. The UK’s main trial registry ISRCTN, recognised by the World Health Organisation \(WHO\), states users should consult COMET **\[5.5a\]**. The ISRCTN registry processed 7,943 trials for the six year period from August 2013 to July 2020, including 5,826 trials that are now completed **\[5.5b\]**. 

 The US\-based Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium describes COMET as ‘ *an essential tool for transforming how key outcomes data is collected, analysed and reported consistently around the globe’* and is ‘ *enabling the application of agreed standardised core outcome sets \(COS\) in global data standards’* **\[5.6\]** *.* These data standards are mandated for submissions to the national drug licensing authorities in the US and Japan. 

 COMET is explicitly welcomed by the Senior Medical Officer of the European Medicines Agency **\[5.1f\]**, with their Paediatric Network reporting how COMET ‘ *has contributed significantly to the assessment of medicines in paediatrics’,* recognising *‘its positive impact on the clinical trials sector’* **\[5.10\]**. 

###  4.4. Changing government funding guidelines 

 The Director of the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) Health Technology Assessment \(HTA\) programme – the UK’s largest government\-funded programme of clinical trials – explains why COMET is important to funders: *‘As a funder I see it as our duty to promote the use of core outcome sets so that the results of our publicly funded clinical trials can be compared and combined with other trials’* **\[5.1g\]**. NIHR funding guidelines require applicants to use the COMET database **\[5.7a\]**. Between April 2015 and March 2019, this guidance underpinned 1,557 applications for Health Technology Assessment funding, resulting in 320 funded trials **\[5.7b\]**. NIHR guidance for COVID\-19\-related funding \(March 2020\) states: ‘ *it is critically important to include the relevant core outcome sets for COVID\-19 as indicated on the COMET website*’ **\[5.7c\]**. 

 Equivalent major funders in Ireland **\[5.7d\]**, Belgium **\[5.7e\]** and the US **\[5.7f\]** have adopted COMET in their guidelines. 

###  4.5. Setting new standards for industry 

 COMET is enabling the pharmaceutical industry to select and report consistent outcomes for commercially funded clinical trials, in which companies globally invest tens of millions of \(US\) dollars. Consistent outcomes ensure trials are relevant to patients and serviceable for other decision\-makers such as NICE. In 2018, the *Big Data for Better Outcomes* toolkit was developed by a consortium of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Roche **\[5.4b\]**. This toolkit cites the COMET database throughout, as best practice in commercial trials **\[5.4b\]**. 

 The *Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials*, ‘SPIRIT’ statement is an international framework for clinical trials that incorporates COMET. Between August 2013 and December 2019, approximately 699 new trial protocols used this framework **\[5.4c\]**, which is endorsed by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson **\[5.4d\]**. 

 Global pharmaceutical company UCB Pharma Ltd uses the COMET database to ‘ *determine what outcomes we should consider setting for our \[commercial\] trials*’, describing COMET’s mission as ‘ *essential*’ **\[5.8\]**.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Older women with breast cancer have poorer outcomes than younger women, partly due to the non\-standard treatment they receive.  As there is little to guide older patients or clinicians when faced with a treatment choice, decisions are often based on personal preference, rather than being evidence\-based. Sheffield Hallam research developed a decision support intervention \(DESI\) to guide optimal, personalised treatment for older women with certain breast cancers. This led to: changes in clinical practice and treatment received, improved patient knowledge, greater shared decision\-making, enhanced quality of life and a sense of empowerment. The DESI has benefitted both clinicians and older women with breast cancer. The DESI quickly achieved global reach, having been used by clinicians on all six continents. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The standard treatment for women with oestrogen sensitive breast cancer is surgery plus endocrine therapy. However, there is a group of women \- those aged 70 and older with \- for whom there is an undetermined difference in treatment outcome, whether they have surgery plus endocrine therapy, or primary endocrine therapy alone. These are likely to be women who are older, less fit or frail, and with a life expectancy of 2\-3 years.  This is largely due to the lack of women in this age group in clinical trials.  In this scenario the choice of treatment is often one of personal preference.  Women ≥70 years of age with breast cancer are consequently less likely to receive surgery \(standard treatment\), which may contribute to the inferior outcomes. Since there is little research to guide best practice or support treatment decision\-making, there is wide variation in treatment across cancer units. 

 Lack of evidence\-based guidance is a significant issue, as there are 2 million cases of breast cancer globally \(WHO 2018\) and 55,000 new cases annually in the UK, with 13,000 in women over 75 years of age \(Breast Cancer UK 2020\).  Sheffield Hallam’s Age Gap study identified and calculated the key elements which allow prediction of outcome in this group of women.  The Age Gap study particularly responded to challenges set to: i\) address this wide variation in treatment \( *Breast Cancer Clinical Outcome Measures*, 2007\) and, ii\) improve patients' treatment information and shared decision\-making \( *Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS*, Department of Health, 2010\). 

 The Age Gap study was a GBP1,900,000 NIHR\-funded programme collaboration between the universities of Sheffield, Sheffield Hallam and Cardiff. The Sheffield Hallam team comprised Professor Karen Collins and Dr Maria Burton. Professor Collins was key in the development of the proposal and a co\-applicant. She has extensive expertise in cancer research and public and patient involvement in health research \(retired May 2018\). Dr Burton is a senior researcher, with significant experience of qualitative and mixed methods research with older adults, who has remained with the study since its inception. The Sheffield Hallam team were responsible for all the underpinning qualitative elements of the DESI development, for user training and implementation in the randomised controlled trial \(RCT\), and for the planning, execution and analysis of the concurrent process evaluation. The study had two phases: 

 **Phase one** consisted of a multi\-centre cohort study that recruited 3,375 women \(≥70\) with operable breast cancer from 56 sites across the UK \( **R1**\).  The aims were to: i\) determine the patient and cancer characteristics which predict whether primary endocrine therapy is safe and effective in breast cancer treatment, and ii\) produce a DESI to support shared treatment decision making. 

 The DESI was developed to support the choice between surgery and endocrine therapy, and primary endocrine therapy. It consists of a brief decision aid \(a summary of frequently asked questions\), a booklet about treatment choices, and a clinician\-facing online treatment decision tool. 

 Online tools exist to support decision\-making in cancer \(e.g. NHS PREDICT and Adjuvant On\-Line\), but no tool existed where there was a choice of surgery and endocrine therapy, or primary endocrine therapy alone. The Age Gap DESI was rigorously developed using cancer registry data, an evidence synthesis to understand the information needs of older women, and with input from 46 patients, 14 healthy volunteers and 25 clinicians \( **R2**, **R3**, **R4**\). The Age Gap DESI is unique, as it is underpinned by data solely from women ≥70. 

 The online tool allows prediction of survival outcomes, stratified by age, co\-morbidity and frailty, depending on the type of treatment the woman receives \(freely available at  [https://agegap.shef.ac.uk/](https://agegap.shef.ac.uk/)\). It also produces personalised patient survival estimates for differing treatments, providing the ability to calculate individually\-tailored decisions about treatments. 

 **Phase two** was a cluster randomised controlled trial \(cRCT\) that tested the impact of the DESI on treatment decisions \( **R5**\). To understand how the intervention worked in clinical practice, a process evaluation was also undertaken. The aims of the cRCT were to test whether the DESI would improve: i\) quality of life \(QoL\) and ultimately the cancer outcomes, and ii\) the treatment decision\-making experience of older women with breast cancer, in line with the *NHS Long Term Plan*. 

 46 breast units were randomised \(21 intervention, 25 control\) and recruited 1,339 women \(670 intervention, 669 control\). Clinicians and patients reported benefits of using the DESI, specifically enhanced information and knowledge leading to altered treatment choice, and increased confidence and involvement in discussion and decision\-making \( **R5**\). 

 The Age Gap study was the first of its kind in the world and has provided evidence and tools to address the need for improved cancer outcomes and shared decision\-making, identified in the *NHS Long Term Plan*, the *NHS Constitution*, and *Achieving World\-Class Cancer Outcomes: A Strategy for England 2015\-2020*.  The scale, design and rigour of the study led to the collection of high\-quality data from over 3300 older women, something previously shown to be unachievable \( **R6**\), enabling the online tool to be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Global Usage of the Age Gap DESI 

 Since becoming available in November 2019, the clinician\-facing online tool has been used increasingly at cancer treatment sites across the world. Figures to December 2020 show 10,257 accesses \(Figure 1\), across 449 cities, in 69 countries, and all six continents. To\-date the greatest uptake is in Europe \(56.3%\), followed by North America \(28%\), Asia \(10.6%\), with Africa, Oceania and South America 3.8% collectively \(Figure 2\). Of the 10,257 accesses, it was used on 7,571 occasions to calculate outcomes for surgery and endocrine therapy, or primary endocrine therapy alone; and 2,382 to calculate outcomes for surgery and chemotherapy, or surgery and no chemotherapy; demonstrating the immediate value of the tool to clinicians. On 304 occasions the information was also printed out for patients’ use; although the tool can produce a leaflet demonstrating the outcomes for the patients, clinicians are selective about which patients this would be most appropriate for. \( **E1**, **E2**\) 



 Figure 1: Three\-monthly usage of the Age Gap DESI, from its launch to Dec 2020 

 Figure 1 illustrates an upward trajectory in use of the tool, but also how the Covid\-19 pandemic affected its use. Following submission of the final study report in July 2020, and the dissemination via virtual events, media coverage grew significantly \( **E3**\), leading to an upsurge in clinician usage in Period 6 \(Figure 1; note P7 is half the duration of the other periods\). 

 Figure 2: Global usage of the Age Gap Tool \(Nov 2019\-Dec 2020\) 

####  Change in Clinical Practice 

 Following the introduction of the DESI, clinicians \- predominantly surgeons \- reported a change in clinical decision\-making and practice \( **E4**\). Prior to the tool being available, the treatment was largely based on clinician preference, with age shown to be an independent factor in that decision, contrary to the NICE guidelines \(CG80\). 

 The tool demonstrated to the surgeons that in some patients, primary endocrine therapy could be more beneficial than surgery, and vice\-versa. The survival figures calculated by the tool, were sometimes unexpected and, when faced with this, they were forced to rethink the appropriateness of their usual management: *“When I look at the two \[treatment options\]… it says... there’s hardly a two or three percent difference, but when I look at the graphs... \[it\] sways me one way or the other... In a lot of patients that I would have thought that they must have been better off with surgery, the tool swayed me… and also the patients; so it has changed in my practice.”* \(Consultant Oncoplastic Breast Surgeon, Participant 2\) \( **E4**\) 

 “W *hereas previously \[prior to the tool\] I would have just said, I think you should have an operation. So, I think in that respect it’s probably meant that I would have the discussion with more people about endocrine therapy, \[rather\] than just surgery…. I’m certainly having a better discussion with the patients.”* \(Consultant Surgeon, Participant 5\) \( **E4**\) 

 Clinicians were pleased to have evidence\-based information, presented as numbers, as this supported their data\-led preferences: *“It has \[impacted on own clinical decision\-making\] because now I have got something that I can solidly… tell somebody.”* \(Consultant Breast Surgeon, Participant 4\) \( **E4**\) 

 The graphical representation of the outcomes was clear and provided a common platform to discuss treatment selection with the patient and/or families/carers.  This had the effect of changing the dynamic of the consultation. Clinicians thought that information from the DESI gave the patient confidence to engage in the decision\-making process and feel more content with their treatment decision. This encouraged their continued use of the DESI: *“I think that the... interventions \[have\] been really good at… empowering patients and helping them make a decision, and we've felt that patients are much more part of the decision making.”* \(Consultant Breast Surgeon, Participant 4\) \( **E4**\) 

 The DESI is not only changing practice, it is also influencing the education of clinicians \- it has been included in the *Communicating Evidence to Patients* course run by University of Cambridge’s Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication as an example of good practice.  [https://moodle.wintoncentre.uk/](https://moodle.wintoncentre.uk/) \( **E5**\) 

####  Impact on Patient Experience 

 Patients interviewed said they felt involved in the decision\-making process, stating that the combination of information formats, i.e. the written and the numeric information, helped them more fully understand the options and possible outcomes, and had given them the confidence and knowledge to engage in the consultation. \( **E4**\) 

 This sense of greater shared decision\-making from the patients’ point of view was confirmed by high scores in CollboRATE, a validated measure of this, and was further supported by a bespoke questionnaire to assess knowledge of treatment options, which similarly demonstrated improved scores \( **E6**\).  These patient experiences are entirely consistent with those of clinicians, suggesting that both were being assisted to make better informed decisions about treatments, upon which they agreed. Patients also found the written information prompted further questions, which they raised during future consultations. Some described how this helped them cope with the treatment journey, as they understood the process and what to expect: *”I thought \[the sheet\] was very good... I’ve always thought it’s good to be able to read these things and see what they think. \[It\] gives you a good idea what's happening, because sometimes people, you know, they seem to clam up, saying the big C and oh, oh. Silence\! But...I don’t believe in that.”* \(82 year\-old surgery patient\) \( **E4**\) 

 The evidence of these impacts supports the plans of the NHS *Five Year Forward View* \(2014\) and the NICE *Shared Decision\-Making Collaborative \- An Action Plan* \(2016\), which commit to empower patients by providing up\-to\-date information about the possible treatments \- to enable them to make more informed decisions. It can also be viewed as a practical step towards nurturing a culture of shared decision\-making \- by providing tailored, patient friendly information to facilitate informed patient choice, as highlighted in the Macmillan report *Cancer in the UK 2014: State of the Nation*. In short, the DESI helped to bring about long\-awaited relational improvements between clinicians and a vulnerable group of older patients, marking an important shift towards an inclusive culture of decision\-making, at a critical time in the life course of these women. 

 The capability for the Age Gap Tool<sup>©</sup> to impact on the treatment and on the experience of older women with breast cancer has been recognised by Professor Riccardo Audisio \(University of Gothenburg\) who  [tweeted](https://twitter.com/raaudisio/status/1222293350935617538) \(28/1/20\): "" *There is no doubt that the*  [*@AgeGapStudy*](https://twitter.com/AgeGapStudy) *will contribute to bringing to an end the under treatment of older women with breast cancer.""*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 This case study focuses on Marine Engineering, illustrating three complementary strands of research for improving ship design, and focusing on improved safety, comfort, stability and performance for ships and vessels. From the original UCL trimaran concept, the US Navy has built a fleet of thirteen Independence Class ships. World leading construction companies of offshore installations such as Hyundai Heavy Industries \(HHI\) and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering \(DSME\), implement UCL research outputs for their safety engineering of topside modules of floating production storage and offloading vessels \(FPSOs\). Shipbuilder, Incat, have incorporated UCL outcomes to guide the design of their vessels, introducing structural changes and saving EUR4,700,000 worth of alloy and fabrication costs. Novel design and analysis methods have been incorporated into the MAESTRO software to optimise ship structural design \(used globally across 23 countries\), and Paramarine® \(SURFCON\) software \(with over 200 user organisations worldwide\).

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 UCL Marine Engineering research focuses on improved ship engineering for defence, commercial and complex ship designs. This is presented in three complementary strands of research; i\) novel design concepts for trimarans, catamarans and complex ships \(ii\)  shipping optimisation through nonlinear finite element models and \(iii\) reduced waste emission from the shipping industry. 

 UCL research on ship design has focussed on novel designs for trimarans and catamarans and new design approaches for complex ships. UCL developed the trimaran ship concept and led research activities in this field; from initial design concept, computational and experimental research and analyses of ship trials, along with contributions to a Classification Society’s Ship Design Rules \( **R1**\). The concept was adopted by the UK Ministry of Defence \(MoD\) with a scaled 6m trimaran model of a 3,000\-tonne destroyer, designed at UCL. When commencing an extensive series of trials for design and operational performance in 2000 \(such as sea\-keeping and helicopter operations\), the results of this UCL\-led research were sufficiently promising for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency \(DERA\) to commission a two\-thirds\-scale Trimaran Technology Demonstrator built by Vosper Thornycroft, Southampton \(UK\). 

  

 UCL revolutionised the trimaran concept through predicted performance from hydrodynamic and structural perspectives, in turn publishing a comprehensive guide to the preliminary design of trimaran vessels \( **R2**\). UCL research into trimaran performance continued through Office of Naval Research \(ONR\) funding with The Atlantic Center for the Innovative Design and Control of Ships \(ACCeSS\), with UCL as the only UK academic partner. Working with the Naval Surface Warfare Center \(NSWC\) Carderock on the design, testing and technology development for trimaran hullforms research addressed parametric resonance \(the interaction of waves with hullform\) and side\-hull positioning, namely the relative location of the smaller sidehulls to the centre hullform \( **R3**\). 

 Catamaran hullforms are predominantly used as high\-speed craft for both commercial and naval applications. They need to be lightweight, but strong enough to withstand loads imparted onto them from large waves. Research at UCL, in collaboration with Incat Tasmania, Revolution Designs and the University of Tasmania, has investigated the motions and loads characteristics of high\-speed craft through a combination of numerical work, full\-scale measurements and physical model experiments \( **R4**\). This work has been funded by a series of Australian Research Council Linkage grants, the most recent awarded in 2018; with additional partners being the National Research Council of Italy \- Institute of Marine Engineering \(CNR\-INSEAN\) and the University of New South Wales. Results from both towing tank and drop test experiments with a hydroelastic model provided a new understanding of the effect of hullform shape on the magnitude of wave loads and how changes to the form of the centrebow can reduce the loads experienced by the vessels \( **R4**\). 

 UCL research into a more architectural approach to complex ship design resulted in a highly novel approach, the Design Building Block \(DBB\) approach. This changes the basis of the initial ship synthesis and hence the resultant design process from the largely ""outside\-in"" underwater hull form focus to an ""inside\-out"" architectural approach, integrated with traditionally preferred sizing with a balance between weight, space and stability. By driving the size of a given design option from the internal and upper decks architectural demands this enables a more informative design exploration, bringing critical operational and human aspects to the fore in initial complex ship design decision making \( **R5**\) and with this a better basis for costing and efficient design for production. 

 From a safety perspective, accidents associated with ships and offshore structures continue to occur and can lead to environmental catastrophes with loss of lives and assets. Work at UCL identified that qualitative approaches with intuitive models and insights are not accurate enough to calculate frequency and consequence and assess risks. Therefore, to improve floating production storage and offloading vessels \(FPSOs\) safety against accidents, quantitative risk assessment methods have been developed using advanced computational models and physical model testing. 

 A new probabilistic method was developed to select a set of credible accident scenarios, where probability density distributions for individual random parameters affecting an accident were characterised based on a large database of historical evidence and a sampling technique was employed to select a limited number of realistic scenarios. Nonlinear finite element method models involving structural crashworthiness in accidents have been formulated for the consequence analysis. Ultimate Limit States \(ULS\) for ship structural design optimisation with multiple objectives, were implemented for ship optimisation process. ULS calculations \( **R5**, **R6**\) were incorporated in ship design software Paramarine® and MAESTRO, to perform fast ULS calculations at each iteration step for the optimisation process. 

 Full\-scale or large\-scale physical model tests on steel stiffened plate structures \(which are the dominant feature of ship and offshore structures\), have been conducted in association with direct measurements of welding\-induced initial imperfections, ultimate compressive limit states at cryogenic condition triggered by brittle fracture, ultimate limit states under lateral patch loading in fires, blast pressure characteristics in hydrocarbon explosions, and collision impacts between ships and icebergs in Arctic operations \( **R6, R7**\). 

 Global shipping currently accounts for approximately 3% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Two major EPSRC research projects were led by UCL to find solutions to reduce these emissions.  UCL developed technical models of ship performance with the ability to accurately predict the influence of alternative fuels, hydrodynamic devices and efficiency improvement techniques, such as sails and micro bubbles, on fuel consumption and emissions. A concept design tool, the Ship Impact Model \(SIM\), was developed to rapidly calculate the technical performance of a vessel with one or more Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies \(CRTs\) at an early design stage. The SIM was used to assess which selection \(individual or combination\) of CRTs have the most potential, in terms of cost\-effectiveness and under other technical, operational and regulatory influences \( **R8**\). These technical models were then integrated into a UCL\-developed techno\-economic model of the global shipping industry, GLOTRAM. The GLOTRAM model reflects changes in the shipping sector by simulating its growth over time. 

 UCL researchers identified that greater efficiency could be achieved through waste heat recovery and worked with a marine diesel\-engine manufacturer \(MTU\), Lloyds Register and Bowman Power Ltd with funding from Innovate UK. In this work, the waste heat recovery process was modelled and practical testing carried out in conjunction with Cranfield University. The energy efficiency results were applied to typical operational profiles of small ships \(such as ferries and coastal tankers\) to determine overall efficiency savings; typically, savings of 5% were identified leading to a payback in approximately six years.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 UCL engineering continues to work on shipping optimisation for defence and commercial use, to improve ships’ design, performance, safety and stability. For example, through novel design shipping concepts, research outputs continue to generate shipping contracts and reduce manufacturing costs. UCL work has also implemented additional safety parameters through ship design software, in turn promoting environmental changes for shipping emissions pathways.  As such, work on low carbon technology and waste recovery have reduced environmental impact in the naval industry. 

 **UCL trimaran concept in shipping industry** 

 UCL developed the new concept of a trimaran ship; the research demonstrated advantages of trimaran ships for ferries and naval vessels \( **R1\-R3**\). These ships have high speed characteristics due to their slender hulls, large deck areas for carrying cargo and equipment, inherently good performance in waves \(over 50% reduction in motion sickness compared to a catamaran\), yet providing extended operational profiles compared to monohulls \(up to 70% improvement\) \( **S1\)**. Large ship builders have used UCL research outputs \( **R1\-R3**\) to build their vessels. For example, 13 Independence Class trimarans of ​Littoral ​Combat Ships \(LCS\) have been constructed for the US Navy between 2010\-2020 \(the latest USS Savannah was launched on 8<sup>th</sup> September 2020\). Four LCS are currently under construction with a further three on order **\(S2\)**, with the contract for each vessel worth approximately USD584,000,000 \( **S2**\). UCL research also led Austal USA \(a global defence and commercial ship builder\) to construct four high speed trimaran ferries for Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, each costing approximately AUD95,000,000 **\(S2\)**. 

 Another large high\-speed ferry builder, Incat, has used research outputs \( **R4**\) to guide the design of their vessels, to ensure that their vessels are structurally reliable. UCL research has led to changes in the bow shape of Incat vessels to reduce the wave loads and improve passenger comfort \(by 25%\), leading to structural weight savings of the order of “\[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] *in large vessels, this reduction in alloy and fabrication costs is worth approximately* \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\]” **\(S3\)**. 

 The DBB approach \( **R5**\) has be used to develop ship designs for organisations and companies such as the UK MoD, BMT, DSTL, UK Shipbuilders & Shiprepairers Association, Canadian Defence Dept, US Navy ONR and Columbian Navy. Many of these studies were in support of governments and industry decision\-making on major warship programmes \(e.g. UK Type 26 Frigate, Canadian Joint Support Ship programme, UK Offshore Patrol Vessels, new Colombian Frigate\). The DBB approach has also provided insights to inform specific design policies \(e,g, topside design \(NDP\), personnel movement beyond just escape \(UK DNA\), design for survivability \(DSTL\), AXV impact on ship design \(Babcock, BAES, NDP\) and distributed systems \(USNavy\-ONR\). 

 **Improved safety for naval architecture design** 

 UCL research into safety approaches \( **R6, R7**\) has led to changes of practice in global industry leaders. The outcomes from UCL research associated with quantitative risk assessment and management against fires and explosions have been transferred to the world’s leading construction companies of offshore installations, namely Hyundai Heavy Industries \(HHI\) and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering \(DSME\). They partnered in the Joint Industry Projects and are using research outputs \( **R6, R7**\) for their safety engineering of topside modules of FPSOs, for safer structures against extreme conditions and accidents. The outcomes have been used to achieve safer structures with improved tolerances against such extreme conditions and accidents. HHI state **\(S4\)** that using research outcomes has “ *provided the impacts associated with not only economical benefits by lowering engineering costs but also safer structural designs by enhancing the safety and production quality. Depending on the complexity and size of structures, the benefits have been achieved up to 5 million USD per vessel*”. 

 UCL research outputs on ULS \( **R5, R6**\) have been directly implemented into MAESTRO software, for design optimisation. Specifically, into ALPS/ULSAP and ALPS/HULL computation modules, to provide computational efficiency and greater accuracy for buckling and ultimate strength for plates and stiffened panels, and hull girder collapse for ships. These outputs have been successfully integrated into MAESTRO to improve ship structural design. MAESTRO Marine LLC state “ *The combined capabilities of MAESTRO with ALPS/ULSAP has ensured that MAESTRO has an advanced capability for structural panel\-level limit\-state analysis. Together the ALPS computational tools enable large scale optimization of sophisticated warships and advanced commercial vessels…and in supporting effective in\-service structural engineering for ships through their life cycles*.” **\(S5\)**. 

 There are 90 active ALPS users are in 23 countries, including Navy \(eg US, Japan, Australia, Spain, Brazil, Columbia, South Korea\), Coast Guard \(eg USCG\) and engineering companies \(eg Navantia, Ingles, BIW, DSTO, SeaxeMers, Serco\). User SpaarnWater have used Maestro for structural evaluation of maritime objects for over a decade **\(S6\)**. In a testimonial SpaarnWater state “ *MAESTRO is an excellent tool to perform a structural analysis of a complete maritime structure already in an early stage of the design process supporting the naval architect in his design decisions. SpaarnWater will continue to use MAESTRO as its main tool in structural design and analysis of maritime objects*.” 

  

 Qinetiq, another user of UCL computational models through Paramarine®, state the tool is "" *an integrated naval architectural design and analysis tool set \(enabling\) seamless collaboration between global teams*"", including *""over 200 organisations worldwide""* and used on "" *designs from aircraft carriers and submarines to commercial ships and megayachts*"" **\(S7\)**. 

 **Reducing the environmental Impact of shipping** 

 Through stakeholders’ collaborations, UCL research outputs have also helped reduce the environmental impact of the shipping industry by providing tools that support development of low carbon technology and better waste recovery. The improved technical models for ship designs, technology developments, and low carbon technology \( **R8**\) were amalgamated into GLOTRAM, UCL Energy Institute’s \(UCL\-EI\) techno\-social\-economic model of the global shipping industry. GLOTRAM influenced the shipping industry through changes in transport demand, macroeconomics \(such as fuel, carbon price and newbuild price inflation\), and the availability of technology and regulation \(such as regulations on greenhouse gases and other emissions to air\). 

 As such, the success of UCL\-EI collaboration led to the allocation of the 3rd IMO GHG study, commissioned by the UN agency International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\) estimating the total GHG emissions from shipping; and has become a key reference in industry and policy debates. This work was submitted in its entirety to the IMO by the governments of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Marshall Islands, Netherlands, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu in the 71<sup>st</sup> session UN IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee \(MEPC\), at a critical point in the negotiation leading up to the climate deal **\(S8\)**. Not only has the MEPC become the key reference for future shipping emissions pathways aligned with the Paris Agreement temperature goals **\(S9\)**, but also provides technical background for specifying key commitments in the UK government’s breakthrough policy Clean Maritime Plan, as well as to achieve UK government objectives on reaching net\-zero by 2050. 

 Through the UCL\-Bowman Power collaboration on marine engines, UCL research outputs on waste recovery led to the development of a new marine waste heat recovery unit.  Independent tests at Cranfield University showed that this new system “ *recovers 30% of waste heat thereby improving efficiency in the region of 5%”* **\(S10\)**. It is now being readied for commercial and naval marine markets with ongoing discussions with shipping company Stena.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Mathematical analysis and modelling by Dr Cook at the University of Strathclyde has identified ways to improve the internationally accepted assessment of a shared cod stock to the west of Scotland. This work resulted in a review of the assessment and a consequent change to the estimated exploitation rate of the stock by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea \(ICES\). On the basis of this and the related underpinning research, Cook has established international reputation that has led to him making significant contributions in similar activities, including: reviewing fisheries assessments conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the USA; being invited to assess the Marine Stewardship Council quality certification standard for fisheries worldwide; and influencing the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\) fisheries policy. Together, these activities are helping fishery managers around the world manage fish stocks more effectively, sustainably and profitably.

##  2. Underpinning research 

###  Context 

 The widespread and growing global demand for fish products supports a multi\-billion\-dollar commercial fishing industry. However, there is increasing scientific, political and public awareness of the damage to marine ecosystems caused by overfishing, especially since the widely reported collapse of Canada’s Atlantic cod stocks in the early 1990s. In order to balance the demand for fish products with the need to protect marine environments, it is increasingly important that fishery managers have access to accurate assessments of fish stock health so that they can effectively and sustainably manage such stocks. Cook’s research aims to provide this through multiple lines of enquiry, as detailed below. 

###  Review of Northeast Atlantic fish stocks 

 In 2013, Cook analysed fish stocks in the Northeast Atlantic, where the majority of stocks are subject to the European Union’s Common Fisheries Policy \(CFP\), a set of rules governing fishing fleets with the aim of conserving fish stocks. The analysis demonstrated that most stocks in the region were recovering and that management interventions were showing some success \[ **R1**\]. This finding challenged the widely held perception that fish stocks in the Northeast Atlantic were in decline and that the CFP had been a failure. A 2019 assessment by Cook of cod stocks in the west of Scotland also suggested that these stocks have experienced a decline in fishing mortality rate and an increase in spawning stock biomass \[ **R2**\]. 

###  Development of new methodologies to assess fish stocks 

 In order to accurately assess the effect of fishing on marine ecosystems it is essential that robust assessments can be made of exploited fish stocks. Cook’s research has focussed on the development of state\-space models that can integrate data from a variety of sources, by accounting for the processes that gave rise to the observations and weighting the data in an objective statistical framework, so that the exploitation status of fish stocks can be monitored. The models make use of time series methods and are cast in a Bayesian framework. Particular novel aspects of this research relate to fish discarded at sea and bycatch of less abundant species that are important for biodiversity. 

 Quantities of discarded fish can be large, accounting for as much as 50% of the catch. However, as discarding occurs at sea it is rarely observed, and discard data are often extremely sparse and unreliable \[ **R3**\]. Further research by Cook therefore focussed on developing a methodology to account for discards in fish stock assessments \[ **R4**\]. This was achieved by modelling the size selection of fish by fishers and the effects of quota limits on discard behaviour. Where the available data are very limited to assess stocks, methods were developed which made greater use of research vessel survey data that have been collected for many years but not fully exploited as an information source \[ **R5**\]. By combining this information with landings data, new models were developed which allow the use of size frequency data to assess population status for stocks. The population model is stage structured \(recruits, juveniles, adults etc.\) making it possible to use length data as a proxy for age. This allows the assessment of stocks for which the absence of age data had previously prevented assessment and which therefore resulted in little or no advice being available to managers \[ **R5**\]. 

###  Investigating the effect of seal predation on cod stocks 

 Another important strand of Cook’s research has focussed on quantifying the effects of grey seal predation on the west of Scotland cod stock \[ **R6**\], a previously overlooked area of cod stock assessment. This work required the development of a state\-space population dynamics model that included a predation sub\-model for seals. The model can make use of periodic observations of seal diet collected by the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University to estimate the parameters of a predator functional response and hence estimate the predation mortality. The model can more realistically estimate current fish stock size by taking into account this mortality and can be used to investigate fish stock recovery under different seal population scenarios \[ **R6**\]. As relevant data is limited, a key element of the modelling is to include time series processes to overcome the problem of missing data. Using a Bayesian approach it is also possible to obtain more realistic posterior distributions of quantities of interest, such as stock biomass, so that uncertainty can be made more transparent to fishery managers. Knowing the level of uncertainty in assessments is important as it allows managers to avoid fishing strategies which might deplete stocks past minimum biomass levels. This research concluded that grey seal predation was suppressing stock recovery despite a drop in fishing mortality \[ **R6**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Cook’s academic reputation has enabled him to make significant and internationally important contributions to sustainable fishing, which is a key factor for food security globally and of major economic importance for many countries. Cook’s contributions include assessing fish stocks, reviewing prior fish stock assessments, providing advice in managing major fish stocks and providing guidelines to government in negotiating fish quotas. These activities cover jurisdictions in Europe, North America and Africa, and are exemplified by the following examples of impacts of Cook’s work, where a ‘fishery’ refers to the harvesting of stocks by national fleets. 

### 1.  Reassessing the state of west of Scotland cod stocks 

 The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea \(ICES\) is the official inter\-governmental body for providing scientific advice on fishery management in the northeast Atlantic. EU and Norwegian fisheries management is based on ICES advice. The stocks on which it advises cover over 200 stocks of fish and shellfish that are worth hundreds of millions of pounds at first sale each year. Changes to ICES advice therefore often have significant economic impacts for fisheries. 

 Until Cook’s research, the internationally agreed ICES assessment of the west of Scotland cod stock suggested that the exploitation rate remained very high and that the stock has collapsed. The resulting zero catch limit for cod prevents trawlers from catching associated healthy stocks such as haddock and whiting, with corresponding economic impacts. However, the research reported above suggested that this assessment had not taken into account the significant role of seal predation on cod stocks. Moreover, the 2013 analysis of west of Scotland fish stocks indicated that the stock may have been recovering and that exploitation had reduced substantially since the beginning of the 21st century. The impact of these findings was widely reported in the mainstream press and trade media \(e.g. BBC News, The Scotsman, Science Daily, World Fishing and Aquaculture\), focussing on the threat posed by seals to fish stock recovery \[ **S1**\]. In January 2019, ICES agreed to review its assessment of west of Scotland cod in light of Cook’s research, and in February 2020 ICES adopted a new model that confirms the reduction in exploitation \[ **S2**: references **R2**, **R4** and **R6**\]. As a result of this review, the role of seals is now recognised in ICES advice to the European Commission \[ **S3**\], which explicitly cites Cook’s work \[ **R6**\]. 

### 1.  Ensuring the quality of US fish stock assessments 

 The Center for Independent Experts \(CIE\) is an organisation funded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the USA to conduct reviews of stock assessments carried out by the National Marine Fisheries Service \(NMFS\). NMFS provides scientific advice to the USA’s Regional Management Councils to determine whether their systems of stock assessment provide fishery managers with the necessary information to effectively and sustainably manage fish stocks. This work ensures the quality of assessments in the USA, the world’s third largest fish producing nation, and contributes to sustainable development and stewardship of the country’s marine ecosystems. As Regional Management Councils are required by US law to manage fisheries in a manner consistent with each fishery’s maximum sustainable yield, the work of CIE is intrinsic to the effective and sustainable management of federally owned fish stocks in the USA, which account for the majority of the country’s total catch. 

 The CIE requires highly experienced authorities with an established research track record for reviews. The body of work described above established Cook as a suitable expert, and since 1998 to the present he has consulted on more than 25 reviews covering nearly 100 stocks for all 8 Regional Management Councils of the USA, focussing on a variety of issues from data\-poor stock assessments \[ **S4**\] to modelling discard estimates \[ **S5**\]. Independent expert reviews such as these are an important factor in fisheries management decision making in the USA. Cook’s review of migratory sharks in the Southeast USA, which concluded that the Regional Management Council’s assessment failed to sufficiently inform fishery managers, resulted in withdrawal of the assessment and a subsequent revision which explicitly addressed the review comments \[ **S6**\]. His 2019 review of the Pacific sablefish stock assessment contributed to an understanding that stock exploitation was decreasing rather than increasing, as previously thought. This realisation has allowed the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to raise the advised catch limit for sablefish for the years 2021\-2030 \[ **S7**\], a change which will result in an estimated USD5,100,000 \(10\-2019\) additional catch annually over the said time period. 

### 1.  Promoting sustainable fisheries through the Marine Stewardship Council \(MSC\) 

 The MSC is an international organisation that promotes good fisheries management practice and sustainable exploitation by encouraging consumers, restaurants and retailers to only buy fish products that have received MSC accreditation, certifying a fishery’s environmental and management credentials. Acquiring the accreditation through an initial assessment, and maintaining it via annual audits and five\-year reassessments, is demanding but gives suppliers a competitive advantage as it allows their catch to be sold with the sought\-after MSC ecolabel. As of 2019, 15% of marine catch worldwide is MSC certified, equating to almost USD10,000,000,000 \(02\-2019\) annually. In the UK, consumers spend nearly GBP1,000,000,000 on MSC products annually, and over 3,500 restaurants serve MSC\-accredited products \[ **S8**\]. 

 Assessing fisheries for MSC certification requires a high level of qualification \[ **S9**\]. The body of research reported in Section 2 again qualified Cook as a suitable expert, and since April 2016 he has assessed different fish stocks in many locations around the world, including cod and haddock in the North Sea \(multi\-country\), yellowtail flounder in Canadian waters, hake in Namibia, Patagonian toothfish in French Antarctica and halibut in Greenlandic\-Canadian waters. For Namibia, for example, Cook was a principal co\-author of the assessment that led to MSC certification of the country’s hake demersal trawl and longline fishery, the largest fishery in Namibia. Fishing is the third largest sector in Namibia’s economy and is expected to grow as a direct result of this certification \[ **S10**\]. In another example, Cook’s evaluation of models used to assess North Sea cod confirmed the stock had been over\-exploited by two fisheries and led to suspension of MSC accreditations for both fisheries in October 2019, demonstrating how protection of fish stocks is aided by the MSC process. 

### 1.  Influencing UK fishery policy 

 As a direct result of Cook’s reputation in the field, in September 2020 he was invited to participate in a high profile project, commissioned by the UK Government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\) and led by the Defra Director of Marine and Fisheries, to establish guidelines for officials negotiating fishing quotas post Brexit. The project report, completed in November 2020, sets out methodology to ensure UK fishery management of stocks shared with other coastal states is compliant with maximum sustainable yield. The resulting document, which includes contributions from Cook, is confidential for understandable policy reasons, though a public version will be published when possible.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The number of people worldwide with limb loss is increasing, with over 1.6 million in the US alone and 185,000 amputations every year. NTU research on advanced prosthetic hydraulic ankles and microprocessor\-controlled knee devices demonstrated improved patient mobility and quality of life. NTU research impacts have increased sales of Blatchford Ltd’s hydraulic ankle devices, including making it the preferred \[text removed for publication\] prescription option, and changed clinical practice improving patient’s clinical outcomes. Blatchford Ltd have used NTU’s research outcomes as research evidence for Medical Device Regulation compliance requirements, in white papers used for product promotion, sales and marketing, and tendering for clinical contracts, and in training at clinical sites in 52 countries. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Incidence of limb loss worldwide is increasing. The 1.6 million people living with limb loss in the United States in 2008 was predicted to double by 2050. In the UK, the leading causes of amputation occurring in adults over 50 years are diabetes and/or peripheral vascular disease. Therefore, most new referrals to prosthetics centres \(6,000 annually in the UK\) involve older patients with health comorbidities. Although prosthetic device prescription is a key determinant of an individual’s long\-term health outlook and quality of life, they typically receive functionally basic prosthetic devices. Research is lacking relating to the efficacy of advanced prosthetic devices that have the potential to improve mobility and quality of life in prosthesis users. This prevents the widespread provision of more advanced devices, as awareness and prescription of these devices must be based upon their clinical efficacy. To address this issue, Barnett \(from NTU’s Exercise and Health Research Group, in our *Sport, Health and Performance Enhancement Research Centre*\) has led work with Blatchford, a multi\-award winning, world\-leading prosthetic device manufacturer, since 2016. The research underpinning this case study has been supported with significant in\-kind contributions from Blatchford \(£80,495 to date\) and has been conducted in collaboration with NHS Trusts and both academic and commercial colleagues. 

 Blatchford supported \(staff time, prosthetic devices\) an NTU\-led cohort study which was the first in the world to quantitatively establish mobility improvements when using hydraulic ankle devices in transtibial prosthesis users with lower activity levels \( **R1**\). Participants walked further during clinical walking tests, with a more even distribution of limb loading and improved gait progression, when using a hydraulic ankle device compared to using a routinely prescribed rigid non\-articulating device. This impact on patient mobility is highly significant given any improvement in mobility leading to increased quality of life is positive in a patient group with low mobility levels and associated health issues. These results confirmed findings from an earlier study, which showed that a prosthetic device's mechanical function consistently has a meaningful impact on gait \( **R2**\). This meant that clinicians could make effective decisions regarding prosthetic prescription based on a gait evaluation from a single session. 

 Further funded patient surveys and public consultation was conducted to shape the research programme and increase the magnitude of patient impact \( **G1**\). This led to a multi\-centre randomised feasibility trial called STEPFORWARD, funded by the National Institute for Health Research \( **R3**, **G2**\). Led by Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, it involved four universities and three NHS Trusts; Barnett was a co\-investigator, a member of the Nottingham site research team and Trial Management Group member. Advanced prosthetic devices such as hydraulic ankles and microprocessor\-controlled knee devices are available within some healthcare systems internationally. Despite demonstrating the positive impact of hydraulic ankles on mobility \( **R1**, **R2**\) there was still a need to demonstrate their effectiveness and cost effectiveness vs. the standard basic devices routinely prescribed, in order for them to become part of standard care. For the trial, 55 participants were randomised across five sites. Whilst in the intervention \(hydraulic ankle\) group, quality of life scores increased, quality of life scores remained the same in the control group. Walking distances in the two\-minute test increased by 7.8 m in the intervention group, compared with a *decrease* of 10.8m in the control group, and sedentary time decreased by 114 minutes in the intervention group compared with a smaller decrease of 34 minutes in the control group. A key outcome was that the study procedures proved feasible and acceptable to both participants and professionals delivering the study. 

 The success of the aforementioned projects related to hydraulic ankle provision in people with transtibial limb loss, convinced Blatchford to support further research in\-kind at NTU \( **G3**\) focussing on transfemoral prosthesis users. An initial case study led by the University of Salzburg, in which NTU’s Barnett was a co\-investigator, was the first to demonstrate that during slope walking, intact limb hip joint loading was reduced when using a hydraulic ankle device in combination with a microprocessor\-controlled knee, compared to a non\-articulating ankle device \( **R4**\). This is significant as the hip and lower back are common sites of pain, discomfort and osteoarthritis for transfemoral prosthesis users. A full scale investigation, led by Barnett, into the effects of prosthetic knee and ankle component combination use on the function and performance in transfemoral prosthesis users, demonstrated that the combination of a hydraulic ankle and microprocessor\-controlled knee, resulted in improved mobility during clinical mobility tests, when compared to less advanced combinations of prosthetic devices \( **R5**\). Beyond demonstrating improving patient mobility and well\-being, NTU’s research is highly relevant for countries with insurance\-based healthcare systems such as the USA. There, clinical evidence informs the eligibility of claimants for more advanced prosthetic devices. Without these demonstrable benefits, these claims may be denied.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Prior to studies led by and involving Barnett at NTU, there was limited evidence of the clinical efficacy and cost\-effectiveness of advanced, self\-aligning hydraulic ankle devices, compared with the basic standard devices routinely prescribed to transtibial prosthesis users with lower activity levels. The benefits of combining a hydraulic ankle device with a microprocessor\-controlled knee device were also undocumented. Barnett’s studies have increased provision of these advanced devices for the improvement of mobility in lower limb prosthesis users, leading to commercial benefits for prosthetics manufacturers and distributors, changes to clinicians’ prescribing practices and increased patient satisfaction. 

 **Economic impacts via improved commercial performance of a world\-leading prosthetics manufacturer and across the wider industry.** 

 Blatchford Ltd is a world\-leading international prosthetic device designer, manufacturer and rehabilitation provider. Headquartered in the UK where its manufacturing operation is based, the company has nine office locations around the world including Russia, US and India. The self\-aligning hydraulic ankle device used in Barnett’s studies was the Avalon<sup>K2</sup>, a commercially available ankle device manufactured by Blatchford, who also own the trademark and patent rights. The outcomes of the clinical studies at NTU \( **G3**\) have directly resulted in the commercial impacts benefiting Blatchford detailed below, including:  ensuring its marketing strategy is based on peer\-reviewed scientific evidence, increasing sales revenues and enabling the company to comply with stricter medical device regulations governing one of its largest markets \( **S1**\). 

 **Marketing strategy impacts**:** Blatchford’s director of research and technology wrote: ‘ *We take an evidence\-based approach to product promotion and place science at the core of all our activities. Dr Barnett’s work has helped us maintain that strategy in several important areas*’ \( **S1**\). The research related to the hydraulic ankle devices \( **R1**, **R2**\) has been cited in six key documents produced by Blatchford to market its products, such as the Avalon<sup>K2</sup> hydraulic ankle device and communicate the evidence underpinning their efficacy. For example, in November 2018 ‘ *a white paper titled, ""A Study of AvalonK2 "", of which Dr. Barnett's research constituted a key part, was downloaded 400 unique times in its first year. It has been extremely well received*’ \( **S1**\). This paper outlined the benefits of hydraulic ankle devices for prosthesis users with lower activity levels, including Barnett’s conclusions around increased walking speed \( **S1**, **S2**\). Research papers \( **R1**, **R2**\) were also cited in Blatchford’s 2020 White Paper looking at the clinical benefits of hydraulic ankle devices more widely; one paper \( **R1**\) was cited in the company’s product brochure for Avalon<sup>K2</sup>; other papers \( **R1**, **R2**, **R4\)** were cited in Blatchford’s ‘clinical compendium’ for hydraulic ankle\-foot products \( **S3**\). Dr Barnett's research used in commercial documentation has helped “ *provide a key part of the training and education of \[the company’s\] staff both at the company’s UK headquarters and distributors around the world*” \( **S1**\). 

 **Contract awards and increased sales revenues impacts**:** Barnett’s research has led directly to an increase in Blatchford’s sales revenues from its hydraulic ankle products, ‘ *The research conducted by Dr. Barnett and its wide\-reaching impact, has almost certainly led to an increase in the sales of our hydraulic ankle products*’ \( **S1**\). Specific examples are provided \[text removed for publication\]. 

 **Regulatory compliance impacts**:** New EU Regulations for Medical Devices came into force in May 2017, imposing stricter requirements for the provision of clinical evidence to demonstrate user benefits. Implementation was planned for May 2020 but was delayed a year due to the onset of the COVID\-19 pandemic. To meet the May deadline, Blatchford submitted Clinical Evaluation Reports for the Avalon<sup>K2</sup> for which Barnett’s research \( **R1**, **R2**, **R4**\) was a key source. Blatchford described Barnett’s research contribution as ‘ *of extremely high importance* *in the R&D department, as it is used as part of the clinical evidence in the Clinical Evaluation Reports*’, a requirement for ensuring Medical Device Regulations compliance and thus enabling the company to continue accessing one of its important markets and maintain its global\-leading position \( **S1**\). 

 **Clinical impact via improvement to evidence\-based professional development and changes to clinicians’ prescription practices.** 

 **Impacts on professional development and training:* Blatchford is a supplier of clinical services, such as rehabilitation and prosthetic provision, to national health services, the military and private sector providers and, as such, clinical education is a key component of its business model. For example, they provide 400,000 appointments annually at 23 NHS prosthetic clinics and five private clinics across the UK alone. Their Principal Prosthetist and Commercial Manager referred to papers \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R5**\) and commented, ‘ *I have engaged with Dr. Barnett’s research through such direct contact as well as journal publications and the conference presentations*’ \( **S4**\), and followed with, ‘ *I have used the research as a key part of the training and education I provide to our staff both at our UK headquarters and clinical sites in 52 countries around the world. For example, I have used the research and commercial documentation to train prosthetists in the fitting and adjustment of prostheses and to solve complex clinical cases. I have recently conducted four webinar series on these components \(May 2020\) that was attended by 309 people from 35 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Germany, India, Israel, Portugal, South Africa and Singapore*’ \( **S4**\). 

 **Impacts on changes to clinicians’ prescription practices**:** Barnett’s research has informed clinicians’ decision\-making relating to prosthetic devices and changed their prescribing practices. One prosthetist \( **S5**\), who is responsible for fitting patients with new prosthetic legs and sees around 100 patients with lower limb amputation wrote that \(specifically referring to\) Barnett’s research *‘has resulted in me changing my clinical practices and I supply more hydraulic ankles to my patients*’ and added that these changes ‘ *have also* *benefitted my patients’ clinical outcomes in terms of mobility and quality of life*.’ The clinical lead for an NHS prosthetic clinic at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, with around 800 patients, said \(specifically referring to\) Barnett’s research ‘ *has resulted in me altering the centre prescription guidelines*’ which has ‘ *led to the prescription of more hydraulic ankles*’, adding that ‘ *these changes in my clinical practice have also benefitted my patients’ clinical outcomes in terms of mobility and quality of life*’ \( **S6**\). \[text removed for publication\]. Blatchford confirmed the global clinical impact of the research: ‘ *Dr. Barnett’s work is influencing prescription of devices throughout the world enabling access to more advanced technologies for lower activity amputees* \( **S1**\).’ 

 **Improved trial patient satisfaction, mobility and health outcomes.** 

 This Avalon<sup>K2</sup> device was also used in the NIHR project \( **G2**\) and associated *STEPFORWARD* trial, for which “ *Blatchford and Sons have had no part in the study design, nor are they involved directly in the research, its subsequent analysis and ultimate dissemination*” \( **S3**\) in order to maintain the independence of the trial. Results from NTU’s research contributions to the *STEPFORWARD* trial have demonstrated that more advanced prosthetic devices lead to better outcomes for patients \( **S8**\). Twenty\-seven patients benefitted from using the self\-aligning ankle device for the *STEPFORWARD* trial and all of them decided to keep the prosthesis at the end of it, indicating that they preferred it to a standard device and that it enhanced their ability to move around and their quality of life \( **S8**\). According to the final report submitted to the NIHR \( **S8**\): ‘ *Some participants described how they felt more mobile in terms of using stairs, the ease of going on slopes, and walking on different surfaces. The transformation was sometimes immediate. Participants acknowledged that they still needed to be careful, but they felt overwhelmingly more confident when moving around*.’ This was corroborated by statements from the study participants themselves. On being provided with the new ankle device, one participant said *‘You felt the difference as soon as they put the foot on and I stood up and walked. There was just no pressure in the knee, none in the hip and no pain at all…it was a lot better walking. It’s more comfortable’* \( **S9**\). Another participant noted *‘I’m not walking stiff. I’m walking like a normal person now’* with a further participant stating, *‘I don’t know what the price difference is but this \(new ankle\) is so much better and if you were learning to walk on one, this would be so much better to learn to walk on one’* \( **S9**\). The ankle device also became integral parts of people’s lives, with a study participant exclaiming ‘ *you can’t have this \(new ankle\) leg back\!*’ \( **S9**\). One comment from a *STEPFOWARD* trial participant reflects the large personal impact the research has on the individual *‘It’s really changed my life doing the study and made it all better’* \( **S9**\).

 1. Summary of the impact 

 UEA research by Terry Haydn has contributed to a shift in public and policy discourse around pupil behaviour in English schools. Haydn’s research challenged DfE and Ofsted claims that behaviour was ‘satisfactory or better’ in over 99.7% of schools. His results influenced the recommendations of the Bennett Review on the impact of behaviour on pupils’ learning.  Teacher\-development tools incorporating the Haydn Scale are widely used resources for assessing and mitigating school behaviour challenges and have been used in training thousands of teachers in the UK and internationally. 
","
 2. Underpinning Research 

 **Identifying the extent of behaviour problems in schools** 

 The ability of pupils to learn in an environment free from disruption significantly improves their attainment and the morale of their teachers. In England, government publications had consistently claimed that poor behaviour was not a significant problem in schools \(Patten, 1994; the Steer Report, 2005/2009\). As recently as 2012, the Department for Education \(DfE\) and Ofsted claimed that behaviour was ‘satisfactory or better’ in over 99.7% of schools in England. UEA research by Terry Haydn was the first body of research to challenge this view. Through a survey of 250 trainee teachers and interviews with over 150 teachers in English schools, he demonstrated that pupil behaviour was, to some extent, a problem in most English schools \(R2, R6\). 

 **The Haydn Scale as response, and use in teacher development** 

 In 2002 Haydn introduced an instrument, now commonly referred to as *the **Haydn Scale** following media coverage**, to describe and assess classroom climate \(R5\). The scale, based on extensive classroom observation in English schools, describes classroom climate on a continuum of ten levels, from being ideally conducive to learning \(level 10\) to one in which the right of pupils to learn, and as a result their attainment, is severely inhibited by poor behaviour \(level 1\). Each level is defined by a descriptor, addressed in the second person to a teacher, with a short vignette of corresponding classroom dynamics designed to resonate with the experiences of teachers and school leaders. The descriptors capture the balance of emphasis on ‘control’ factors \(at lower levels\) versus ‘learning’ factors \(at higher levels\), and the implications of that level for pupil outcomes and the teacher’s enjoyment of their job. The scale was the first to bridge research and practice by providing an instrument enabling teachers and student teachers to consider reflectively the extent to which the teacher is in control of the classroom, and able to create and sustain a working atmosphere that optimises pupil learning \(R1\). 

 **Using the Haydn Scale to generate teacher testimonies about classroom climate** 

 Haydn’s more recent research \(R2, R3, R4\) used the Haydn Scale to elicit ‘teacher testimonies’, in which teachers report their experiences of addressing common problems relating to pupil behaviour. Haydn’s website presents coded teacher testimonies from 150 interviews with teachers \(R6\), and provides a resource enabling student\- and newly\-qualified teachers’ access to both the views of experienced teachers, and the strategies they use, to establish a working atmosphere in the classroom which is conducive to pupils’ learning. 

 **What the Haydn Scale and teacher testimonies tell us about behaviour in schools** 

 As well as radically changing perceptions of the extent to which behaviour is a problem in English schools, the research provides insights into the complex factors contributing to deficits in classroom climate and their influence on pupil attainment, teacher wellbeing, and morale. Teacher testimonies from the research give insights into ‘in\-school variation’ in classroom climate. By detailing the varying and subtle relationships between teaching skills, subject knowledge, learners and contexts, the testimonies illustrate why some teachers are able to secure higher levels on the Haydn scale than others, even when working with the same pupils. The testimonies also provide usable insights into teachers’ views on how teachers get better at managing pupil behaviour.

 4. Details of the impact: 

 **1. Influencing policymaking in the UK:** The landmark Bennett Review, published in 2017 \(S2\), was commissioned by the DfE to review the impact of standards of behaviour on pupils’ learning, and staff satisfaction in English schools. Bennett, Lead Advisor to the DfE on behaviour, invited Haydn to be an expert contributor to a series of DfE meetings. The Bennett Review cites 8 Haydn publications, including R1 and R2, and directly quotes 922 words of Haydn’s work \(R2\) to support Bennett’s proposals for improving school learning cultures by addressing behaviour. Bennett says: *‘To emphasise the case that there is a substantial opportunity to improve behaviour in schools, it is useful to quote extensively from Professor Terry Haydn* \(2014\) \(R2\) *below who made a careful exploration of both the appearance and the lived reality of classrooms in the UK’* \(S2\). 

 \[redacted text\] writes about the role Haydn’s research played in shaping the review: 

 *‘The report draws in particular on \[Haydn’s\] 2014 paper* \(R2\). *The research questioned the positive picture which had previously been painted of standards of behaviour in English schools and suggested that behaviour was a much more significant and widespread problem than was generally acknowledged at the time. The research contributed to the decision of the DfE to look into the issue of behaviour in schools... Since the publication of the reports, there is now a much more general acceptance of the importance of behaviour as an issue for schools to address, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to pupil wellbeing and attainment by deficits in classroom climate.’* \(S1\) 

 The Bennett Review has had far\-reaching consequences for policymaking on behaviour management in English schools. In 2014, Ofsted requested a copy of Haydn’s research \(S3\) and Haydn was subsequently invited to be part of the DfE commissioned review of behaviour in schools. Ofsted’s most recent policy document on behaviour, ‘HMCI commentary: Managing behaviour research’ \(2019\) cites the Bennett Review at length and marks a radical shift from their earlier \(2012\) statements on behaviour in schools. 

 **2. Developing teacher education to improve pupil behaviour: ** The Haydn scale is the most widely used instrument for understanding the issues of classroom climate and pupil behaviour in England \(S5\). Haydn’s research is adopted by many university\- and school\-based providers of initial teacher education. It has been presented to the 99 university members of the Universities’ Council for the Education of Teachers \(UCET\), its Executive Director stating *‘the research has been shared widely – and utilised – by HEI based educators since it was disseminated to them through UCET forums and the annual UCET teacher education conference. The 10\-point scale has had a positive impact on how classroom management is covered in ITE programmes and as a result, how it is dealt with in schools’* \(S5\). In October 2020, the National Association of School Based Teacher Trainers \(NASBTT\) selected Haydn’s research for inclusion in the online Routledge School Based Teacher Training Hub, commissioned ‘to provide trainee teachers and their mentors with focussed, accessible, evidence\-informed guidance that will help develop skills and confidence for successful classroom practice’. The online hub serves NASBTT’s 200 member providers and over 10,000 trainees. It is complemented by the book ‘Secondary Behaviour Management: The Essentials’ \(2019, edited by Oberholzer for Routledge\).  Both of these training resources present Haydn’s research, initially published in R1, to trainee teachers, mentors and teacher educators \(S8\). 

 Many thousands of student teachers have been inducted into the use of the scale in face\-to\-face invited lectures in ITE institutions since 2010 \(S5\), and the research instrument and teacher testimonies are used by many partnership schools when students go out on placement.  Feedback from institutions where Haydn’s lectures present the Haydn Scale shows a high proportion of attending trainee teachers find the research and supporting teacher testimonies to be useful. At the University of Oxford \(2016\), for example, of the 107 trainees making an evaluative comment on Haydn’s PGCE lecture and resources, over 94% considered them at least ‘valuable’, with 73% considering them ‘very valuable’ \(S6\). Trainee teachers at University College London \(2019\) stated the lecture and resources ‘ *really resonated with myself and everyone around me*’ and ‘ *put me at ease with the very tricky and daunting prospect of classroom management*’ \(S7\). The Haydn Scale improved trainees’ understanding of the complex judgements needed to establish good working atmosphere \(‘ *not just binary choices’*\), raised aspirations \(‘ *given me some goals I’d like to achieve*’\) and supported action for improving teaching \(‘ *something I will use when observing classrooms’*\) \(S7\). School mentors use the scale in observation/lesson evaluation practices, remarking on the impact of the Haydn Scale for overcoming ‘ *trainees’ anxieties about class management*’ through ‘ *discussion of the levels’* \(S7\). 

 Several Course Directors of leading Initial Teacher Education providers and behaviour experts attest to the usefulness and impact of the research \(S4, S5\), for example: 

 **UCL:  ‘...for more than a ten year period… he* \[Haydn\] *has reached 600\-700 student teachers each year, just as they begin teaching in schools across London and SE England. So, his research and findings have reached about 6,000 secondary teachers, and upwards of 300 schools....* \[The\] *research and the 10 point scale he used in the research has been very well received by the student teachers, in their evaluations and has had real impact in enhancing their classroom management, thereby improving teaching and the learning of young people, often in socially/economically disadvantaged circumstances. Terry’s research and dissemination has thus contributed to social justice for young people in London and beyond.’* \(S5\) 

 **Oxford:  ‘Terry Haydn has delivered an annual lecture on classroom management to our PGCE cohort \(n. 190 each year\) for the past 11 years. The lecture is based on the research outlined in Terry‘s book ‘Managing pupil behaviour: working to improve classroom climate’ and the 10 point scale on which the research was based. The lectures have been exceptionally well received by our student teachers and the evaluations of the sessions have been consistently positive. The 10 point scale instrument is therefore highly likely to have influenced the thinking and practice in classroom management of over 2000 student teachers from the University of Oxford. The vast majority of these student teachers now work in state education and many are in senior positions in schools.’* \(S5\) 

 Attesting to how the Haydn Scale and teacher testimonies evince recognition in those who teach in classrooms, \[redacted text\] \(Teachers’ TV, behaviour consultant and trainer\) commented on how they promote reflection, discussion and action relating to classroom climate: ‘ *I have used the scale and teacher comments arising out of the research in my own professional development work with teachers and student teachers. The scale unfailingly intrigues and interests those involved and is an excellent resource for exploring why some teachers become better than others at managing pupil behaviour. I have recently undertaken some work with STEM training and note that Professor Haydn’s work is used by them in their influential teacher training projects.’* \(S4\) 

 In April 2020, Haydn distilled and coded teacher testimony from his research in a way that clearly articulated the views of experienced teachers on the most common behaviour problems teachers encounter in classrooms. The teacher testimony resource accompanying the Haydn Scale gives teachers and student teachers better understanding of complex factors influencing pupil behaviour, the effect that classroom climate has on pupil learning, and insights into why pupils behave better for some teachers than others. This enhanced the accessibility of an important part of Haydn’s research, making the data, findings and tools easily available to initial teacher education students/tutors in higher education, and students/mentors in schools, to use in conjunction with the scale itself. This increase in the reach and impact of the research has been acknowledged by DfE’s Behaviour Advisor: 

 *‘The more recent accessibility of “themed” teacher testimony from the research, on the behaviour section of Professor Haydn’s website, has also, in my opinion, enabled student teachers and NQTs to benefit from the views of experienced teachers on how to address common problems related to pupil behaviour, such as how to get the class quiet, refusal, sending pupils out, moving pupils etc.’* \(S1\) 

 Many more teachers and student teachers have accessed the scale and teacher testimony on the scale via the Teachers’ TV lecture on the research. Several Teacher Education MOOCs/VLEs have featured the use of the scale, including UCL, University of Reading, Manchester Metropolitan University, University of Oxford, University of Sussex, University of Nottingham and University of York. 

 **3. Raising awareness and improving teaching and classroom management in schools:** 

 Haydn’s research has also contributed to changes in school management, school improvement and continuing professional development programmes associated with pupil behaviour. Behaviour consultant \[redacted text\] states *‘...Haydn’s research dispelled the rather cosy ideas about standards of behaviour in UK schools which prevailed a few years ago and has contributed to an acknowledgement that poor pupil behaviour is a major issue in the UK education system.’* \(S4\) 

 Setting issues of classroom climate in the context of school improvement, in 2016 Schools Minister Nick Gibb asked academy directors ‘ *What is behaviour like in your schools?*’, citing Haydn’s research and acknowledging Haydn’s findings about ‘the continued prevalence of disruption’ and their importance. Presenting Haydn’s findings relative to OFSTED’s ‘Under the Radar’ report and the Bennett Review, Gibb emphasised ‘ *understanding of the classroom culture in your schools*’ as a complement to school\-level data, and for ensuring ‘ *your academy trust allow*\[s\] *every pupil to go as far as their talents will take them.*’ \(S3\) 

 Bennett’s online Master’s level course on managing pupil behaviour makes extensive use of Haydn’s research. \[redacted text\] acknowledges that ‘... *Haydn’s research has had a significant influence in shifting perceptions of the issue of behaviour in English schools, and the scale and associated materials have had a positive influence on the quality of training available to teachers and student teachers in UK schools.’* \(S1\) 

 For school leaders and middle managers, the Haydn scale and materials have had an influence in terms of steering them towards making behaviour issues a higher priority, and in focusing on the problem of ‘in\-school variation’ in classroom climate.  At the level of individual trusts, Haydn’s research has contributed to academy improvement by providing tools to inform continuing professional development for existing teachers, for example by invitation from Sapientia Trust, whose Professional Development Lead invited Haydn’s training for *‘supporting and working alongside my teachers’* and requested *‘resources to use … across the wider Trust of four high schools and eleven primaries, and within the Teaching School.’* \(S7\) 

 **4. Influencing policy and practice and raising awareness internationally** 

 Since 2014, the Haydn Scale has been adopted in several other countries \(S9\) following translation of the scale and accompanying teacher testimonies into languages including Polish, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. The 2015 paper \(R3\) brought the scale to a wider international audience, and Haydn has subsequently been invited to talk about the research at a number of national and international conferences and seminars. The metrics for R3 in *Creative Education*, with large south east Asian readership, report 3,841 downloads and 4,927 views \(taken from scirp.org, as of December 2020\). The research is featured on teacher education MOOCs which include online interviews and simulations relating to the Haydn Scale and supporting teacher testimony resources, which have attracted subscriptions from over 140 countries \(S10\). Blog commentary from one of the FutureLearn MOOCs provides insights into why teachers find the Haydn Scale and accompanying materials useful. Participants praise the Haydn Scale’s ‘ *realistic approach*’ and linked ‘ *self\-review*’ resources for enabling teachers ‘ *to be honest*’ about classroom climate, helping them ‘ *address the factors that are influencing the learning environment*’. Teachers stated they ‘ *learnt a lot on behaviour management*’ thanks to the well explained articles \(S10\). 

 The translated Haydn Scale and materials have been accepted for publication on a major Polish education website \(S9\), and in February 2019, Haydn was invited to give a lecture and seminars on his research at the University of Tallinn, Estonia \(S9\). The Haydn Scale is widely used in schools and ITE in New Zealand; the Editor of *Principals’ Digest* described the scale as ‘one of the most widely requested and useful resources for school principals and lead teachers in New Zealand’ \(S9\). The research and supporting materials were presented and shared with 200 participants at the Innovation Teach National Conference on Behaviour in Chicago, 1st July 2014. Haydn was also invited to talk about the research at a national teacher conference in Slovenia \(S4\) and provided an online workbook on the working atmosphere of the classroom for its teacher delegates \(S9\). An adapted version of the scale for use with mathematics teachers has been used as part of the MathTASK teacher development programme in the UK and Greece \(S9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton into the numbers of women working in the British film industry and the collection of their career stories injected quantitative and qualitative evidence into debates about equality and diversity in the screen industries. It engaged the film industry through related public institutions and organisations, working professionals, filmmaking educators and film production students. This work increased awareness of the reality of gender inequality and its intersection with ethnicity within the industry, facilitated discussion of these issues, and advocated for and contributed to policy change. Key outcomes included the use of the project data by the British Film Institute \(BFI\) as evidence and support for new equality and diversity policies. The research helped many individual filmmakers to make the case for tackling gender inequality in their own roles and to influence others in this highly collaborative industry. Media attention to the project increased the public visibility of these issues, tying them to wider debates about equality while challenging the cinema and film\-loving public to recognise the barriers facing women filmmakers and to think of ways they might better support them.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research largely emerged from the AHRC\-funded project ‘ *Calling the Shots: women and contemporary film culture in the UK, 2000\-2015*’ \(£589,710.31, September 2014 – August 2018\), of which Dr Shelley Cobb was the Principal Investigator. The project produced two main strands of primary research: data collection of the numbers of women working in six key production roles \(director, writer, producer, exec\-producer, cinematographer, and editor\) on all British qualifying films from 2003 to 2015; and a set of recorded interviews with women filmmakers working on UK films. 

 Though women’s film authorship had been a key issue for early feminist film studies and theory, interest in this area had waned due to academic developments in gender studies and a cultural backlash to feminism. Cobb’s book *Adaptation, Authorship and Contemporary Women Filmmakers* was an early contributor to the resurgence in research on women and film authorship in the contemporary period \[ **3.1**\]. Cobb’s research argues for the feminist significance of films made by women, whether those films are explicitly feminist in their politics or not, in an industry where male directors dominate \(and consequently reap the critical and/or commercial benefits of their advantage\) \[ **3.1** & **3.4**\]. The gender imbalance in the industry is replicated in the scholarly film canon, film history, and film studies’ methodological approaches to film production and reception, as Cobb’s research regularly shows \[ **3.1**, **3.2**, **3.3** & **3.4**\]. 

 The reality of gender bias in these two contexts – where very few women get to make films and then those that do are largely left out of canonical film histories – were the impetus for ‘Calling the Shots’. An initial version of the project that collected gender data on British films for the years 2009\-2010, funded by the University of Southampton, showed that gender inequality in the UK industry was indeed a problem: fewer than 20% of key filmmaking roles were held by women \[ **3.6**\]. 

 The first data report made publicly available was published in May 2016. It is a detailed account of the exclusion of women in the British film industry. Of all the films in production during 2015, 25% had no women in any of the six roles, and women made up only 20% of all the workers in those roles for that year. Women producers are the largest group at only 27%. Screenwriters were 20% women, editors were 17% women, directors were 13% women and cinematographers were only 7% women. The report also showed BAME women were doubly discriminated against, as they accounted for only 1\-2% of each role, except for cinematographers where there were *no* BAME women \[ **3.2** & **3.6**\]. Eight additional reports have been completed \[ **3.7**\]. The report on BAME women shows that 90% of all British films in a four\-year period had no women of colour in any key role. The research comparing films with small budgets \(<£0.5m\) versus those with high budgets \(>£30m\) shows a tendency for numbers of women to decrease as budgets increase; not one film in the higher budget category had a woman cinematographer. In the context of Brexit, the research shows that co\-productions \(films funded by both the UK and at least one other nation\) have more than twice as many women directors than all domestic and inward investment \(usually US\-funded\) films. Two reports were shared at the 2018 Cannes film festival. One showed that, effectively, no improvement in gender inequality had been made between the years 2003 and 2015. The other gave a comparison of our data with data on American films and clearly showed that the British film industry is not any better at gender equality than Hollywood \[ **3.6**\]. All of Cobb’s and Calling the Shots’ research makes it undeniably clear that women are widely and consistently excluded from key creative roles in the British film industry. 

 The research team interviewed 59 women working in the six key creative roles in the datasets. The qualitative research in the interviews adds detail to the macro\-view of the quantitative research \[ **3.2**\]. They offer evidence of the gendered barriers individuals have experienced, from sexual harassment, to loss of job while pregnant, to inappropriate questions about childcare, to comments about not needing any more women or persons of colour \[ **3.3** & **3.5**\]. Alongside the quantitative data, the oral histories offer evidence of success and women’s ideas about how to combat sexism in the UK film industry, which include on\-set crèches, budget line\-items for childcare, having a female producer lead hiring and more \[ **3.3**\]. Collectively, the interviews help to correct the bias toward men in scholarly film history and offer an example of an alternative methodology for researching and understanding women’s film authorship \[ **3.3**\]. These oral histories of women filmmakers construct a detailed account of the significance of women’s work and experiences in twenty\-first\-century British filmmaking. The interviews will be housed in perpetuity in the British Entertainment History Project \(upon deposit in late 2021\), run by the British Broadcasting Entertainment Communications and Theatre Union \(BECTU\). The addition of the interviews will increase the numbers of women in the UK’s largest collection of oral histories with professionals in the film and television industries from 17% to 25%.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **a\) Influencing British Film Policy** 

 ‘Calling the Shots’ \( **CtS**\) has sought to engage the British Film industry with the findings of the project from its inception. Indeed, the British Film Institute and Women in Film and Television – UK, were key project partners throughout. 

 The publication of the project datasets raised awareness of continuing inequalities and facilitated discussion of these within the industry. The launch of our first dataset at **BFI Southbank** in May 2016, was open to the public and invitations were sent to 30 key industry executives, producers, filmmakers, guild leaders, union leaders and activists. CtS first presented their data on gender behind the scenes on British films made in 2015 and then had five special guests respond, ending with an open Q&A. The panel guests were: Lizzie Francke of the BFI Film Fund, producer Sarah Curtis \( *Mrs. Brown*, *Run Fat Boy Run*\), director Hope Dickson Leach \(BFI\-funded *The Levelling*\), critic and Bechdel Test Fest founder Corrinna Antrobus, Kate Kinninmont, CEO of WFTV\-UK and director Gurinder Chadha \( *Bend It Like Beckham*\). Attendees included: Amanda Neville, CEO of the BFI; Robbie Allen, Senior Screen Exec for Creative Scotland; Celine Haddad, Head of Creative England; Nichola Martin, BBC Films Development Exec., Iain Softely, chair of Directors UK; Eva Yates, Film 4 commissioning executive. Audience members were asked the question *how did the event change your views about women working* *in film*? Responses included: ‘I don’t feel so isolated in the struggles’; ‘It has reinforced my feelings that there may be hope but that change is too slow’; ‘Views not changed but enthused by the energy and the useful ways to make change’; ‘I think I’ve become used to being the only one or one of the only women on shoots, so in a way I didn’t understand just how unequal the stats are. It just makes me more determined’; ‘It was very enlightening. I appreciated the depth of discussion’. The data shared at this event was reported in *The Guardian*, *The Independent*, *Screen International*, *The Telegraph*, and *Sight and Sound* \[ **5.1**\]. Three days after this event, a *Guardian* article written by BFI Film Fund director, Ben Roberts, was published in which he directly quoted the data from CtS and then wrote, ‘When statistics this stark are published, action is needed’ \[ **5.2**\]. 

 However, Head of Diversity Jennifer Smith and Inclusion Executive Melanie Hoyes note in their testimonial, ‘there is some aversion to EDI \[Equality Diversity and Inclusion\] targets in film funding throughout the industry’ \[ **5.4**\]. Targets are not easily implemented as there is debate as to their legality under the 2010 Equality Act. As such, the BFI Diversity and Inclusion office had to persuade the institute’s executives and lawyers of the need for and value of a target policy. The research from CtS was instrumental in achieving this, as they testify: ‘The Inclusion division has used Cobb’s research…to support changes we have made to increase gender equality and diversity in behind\-the\-scenes roles for films funded by the Institute…Cobb’s research helped us make our case that \[EDI targets\] are an important way to begin to rectify longstanding and severe underrepresentation in the film industry’ \[ **5.4**\]. In 2018, Ben Roberts announced the BFI’s new gender and diversity targets for directors, writers, and producers of films supported by their Film Fund. These targets included a 50\-50 gender balance in supported filmmakers, 20% target for BAME filmmakers, 9% target for LGBTQ\-identifying filmmakers, 7% target for filmmakers with a disability. These were underpinned by a commitment to monitor and report decisions annually across the writers, directors and producers of supported projects in terms of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability \[ **5.3**\]. CtS research was instrumental in making this new policy a reality and ‘has been a game changer after years of trying to get execs and leaders in the industry to see that the British film industry has a gender problem \(Kate Kinninmont, CEO of WFTV\-UK\) **\[5.7\].** 

 **b\)** **Affecting Change in the Wider Industry** 

 The impact of CtS research on the BFI’s gender equality and diversity targets has been reinforced by work with other film industry\-related organizations and individual filmmakers. Project partner, **Women in Film and Television UK**, has used CtS research to influence key decision\-makers in the British film industry. In May 2018, the CtS team presented new data at **Cannes Film Festival** networking events hosted by WFTV\-UK. At their luncheon event for independent women film producers based in the UK, on one of Cannes’ famed yachts, the team presented evidence that: a\) women work in significantly higher proportions on co\-production British films than on domestic ones, and b\) the proportion of women producers reached over 40% on films with a budget of less than £0.5million, significantly higher than the 27% of women producers on all British films. Women producers have recounted that these reports made them newly aware that they were <ins>not</ins> 50% of the workforce as they had thought, and that there were still barriers to work on bigger\-budget films \[ **5.5**\]. The CtS team also shared with them data that shows that when a woman producer is on a film from the beginning, that film is more likely to have a woman director, writer, editor and cinematographer than a film with only men producers. After both the BFI and Cannes events, women producers and directors reported that this research has encouraged them to seek out other women to fulfil key creative roles on their projects. Sarah Curtis, producer of films like *Mansfield Park* \(1991\) and *Ophelia* \(2018\) attests that CtS’s ‘shocking figures on BAME representation gave me real pause for thought and forced me to question whether I had done and was doing enough to seek out employees from underrepresented groups. I will be actively addressing this on my next production’ \[ **5.5**\]. Hope Dickson Leach, writer\-director of *The Levelling* \(2016\) says that ‘I often feel responsible for hiring women in HOD roles, and this report made me see why doing that is so essential’. Furthermore, she says the report empowered her to challenge others and to ‘speak out on why men need to hire women – as we alone can’t shift the numbers’ \[ **5.6**\]. 

 The second event at Cannes hosted by WFTV\-UK was the evening networking social in the British industry tent, at which the team presented their data comparing the UK industry with Hollywood. Tickets sold out before the festival started. The CtS team presented their research showing that the UK industry fails at including women just like Hollywood does. They demonstrated with their data that the percentage of women in British filmmaking is either lower or higher by only a few points than in the bigger\-budget films made across the Atlantic. Kate Kinninmont, CEO of WFTV\-UK, in her testimonial says ‘Their  hard  data  broke  a  myth…that  UK  filmmaking  must  be  better  at  equality,  inclusion  and  diversity  than  Hollywood  and  it opened  the  eyes  of  many  influential  industry  insiders  who  expressed  their  astonishment  at the  figures  and  their  desire  to  make  our  industry  better’ \[ **5.7**\]. News outlets from across the British Isles ran stories on these reports, including *The* *Glasgow Herald*, *The Belfast Telegraph*, *Itv.com*, the *Independent.IE*. and *The Evening Express* \[ **5.8**\] 

 CtS also held three events geared toward film production students to get them thinking about equality and diversity before entering the industry. At the University of Winchester \(Feb 2016\), Cobb presented the datasets and clips from the interviews discussing their career progression to film production students. These were followed by a film screening and discussion with Kate Kinninmont \(CEO of WFTV\-UK\) and Rebecca Brand \(director of *Credible, Likeable, Superstar, Role Model*\). This event resulted in young women seeing women filmmakers as effecting change: ‘This film has shown me that people are doing something and I feel more hopeful’, ‘also realising how filmmaking is so effective in presenting a message’, ‘the talk was inspiring and made me want to go further and change the industry’, ‘I feel so much more inspired to go forward and pursue a career’. Cobb and Williams gave a presentation at the London Film School \(Mar 2019\) that elicited students’ ideas on how to change the industry: ‘identify films that make an effort to include women’, ‘policy level changes and regulations’, ‘quotas and grassroots initiatives’, ‘a rebate for films with women directors’. The final event at London College of Communication \(Apr 2019\) asked the students to think about what are ‘the biggest reasons for inequality’? They said: ‘sticking to what’s comfortable’, ‘internalised sexism’, ‘women are not seen as strong, intelligent, as capable as men’, ‘men don’t fight for change because it benefits them’. And their responses, to ‘what other kinds of information would you like’ was repeatedly a version of ‘data on different countries’ or of more data on other marginalised identities \(e.g. trans\-persons, sexuality, disability\) suggesting that the research got them thinking about how deep and wide the problem is. \[ **5.9**\] 

 **c\)** **Shifting Public Opinion** 

 CtS was a voice in public discussions at a time of increased focus on inequality in the UK, as well as US, European and other film industries. The launch of CtS’s first data report at the BFI Southbank on 10 May 2016 was organised with the BFI’s education department. The event was open to the public as well as industry workers, and the 100\-capacity room sold out in two days. Attendees said: ‘It reinforced my perceptions but with evidence’, ‘As an educationalist I am shocked by the endemic prejudice in the film industry’; ‘All women’s lives are negatively influenced by the lack of women filmmakers’ \[ **5.10**\]. Cobb published an article, ‘Why research on women filmmakers matters to us all’, for the widely\-read *Women and Hollywood* site the day before the event, and media coverage \(noted above\) extended the reach of the published data and related discussions. 

 CtS also presented data at events tailored to cinema loving public audiences and aspiring professionals, both locally and nationally. These included a presentation of our initial data and interviews at University of Southampton’s Intl Women’s week \(Mar 2015\); a life\-long learning day at the University of Southampton on Women and British Cinema; as well as members of the public who attended the events at the University of Winchester and the BFI. Feedback \(150 respondents\) across these events shows that 94% of respondents rated the event either 5 or 4 \(where 5 = 'excellent'\) and 94% said the event made them want to watch more films by women. The events were particularly good at changing the public’s perception of gender inequality in filmmaking. They commented: “The numbers are even more dire than expected. It makes me respect women's dedication even more”; “I'm shocked by the endemic prejudice that exists in the film industry”; “I knew it was a small amount, but never such low numbers. The gender divide in terms of treatment is most perturbing”; “Statistics are an eye\-opener. \[I am\] shocked at how bad it is”; “This has made me realise the importance of supporting women filmmakers in ways I had not thought of before.” \[ **5.10**\] 

 **d\) Advocating Industry Reform** 

 CtS has not only sought to influence change in the industry but also to advocate for reforming it. The research has been used by other groups to pressure the industry to alter its work culture to improve EDI, and Cobb receives regular requests for her expertise. Hope Dickson Leach testifies that ‘as a co\-founder of campaigning community Raising Films, the data and research provided in the report has been essential in shaping our approach and making our case for changing the support available for parent and carer filmmakers \(most of whom are women\). It also showed us how crucial data and analysis is in making change’ \[ **5.6**\]. Cobb has become a member of the Media Reform Coalition upon request of the group’s representative for the British Entertainment Cinematographic and Theatre Union to broaden their scope beyond news and current events. The CtS data reports were used in an evidence review on the issue of equality and diversity submitted to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport by Dr Dave O’Brien after a call for consultation on the effects of COVID lockdown and restrictions on the film and television industry. COVID restrictions are an ongoing issue for the industry, and Cobb and Wreyford were commissioned by the Film and TV Charity to write a report detailing evidence of the impact of COVID on the film and television workforce to help them develop their COVID\-19 Recovery Fund that distributed £2million. CtS data was at the heart of the report, which the CEO says ‘help\[ed\] us understand the intersectional interplay of different axes of marginalisation in the industry…and has enabled us to design a fund which will support people most likely to suffer the negative impact of the crisis on their careers’. \[ **5.11**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In the UK, over 6,000 people die by suicide each year.  Research by Professor Owens on the prevention of suicide in public places has enabled all of England’s 152 public health teams to deliver the national suicide prevention strategy, with 78% including specific actions to reduce suicides in public places; directly informed the 2018 NICE Guideline on preventing suicide in community and custodial settings; and informed Highways England’s strategy and training of all 2,000 of its traffic officers in preventing suicides on the road network.  The research\-based leaflet ‘ *It’s safe to talk about suicide*’ has been used by at least nine local authorities, five universities, the RNLI and the Fire Officers Association, and directly shaped national public health campaigns empowering lay people to play an active part in suicide prevention. 

 The research has therefore **informed national public health policy**; **supported changes to practice** in public and private organisations; and directly **contributed to national public health campaigns related to suicide prevention in the UK**.  Whilst it is hard to quantify, feedback from organisations that Prof Owens advised show they believe it has had a major impact on reducing the risks of suicide. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Many people who die by suicide have had no recent contact with health services, so there is limited opportunity for clinical intervention. Research led by Prof Owens and her team has focused on community\-based approaches and is firmly rooted in a public health perspective. 

 **2.1 Informing public health policy and supporting local authority practice.** 

 In 2013 responsibility for public health, including suicide prevention, was transferred from Primary Care Trusts to local authorities. Prof Owens and her team have worked closely with Public Health England \(PHE\) to ensure that the 152 local authority public health teams in England have clear, practical guidance based on the best available research evidence. 

 **2.1a **Preventing suicides in public places.** In 2014, we won a PHE contract to revise the 2006 NIMHE guidance for the newly created Local Authority public health teams. We reconceptualised the problem from a community\-based and systems perspective, reviewed scientific and grey literatures **\[3.1\]**, consulted public health teams with experience of managing sites frequently used for suicide, and interviewed people who have tried to take their own lives at such sites. We synthesised these diverse findings to produce a guide for local authorities and piloted it in partnership with the public health team responsible for a frequently used suicide location in England **\[3.2\]**. 

 **2.1b **Evaluating the utility of suicide audit**.** Effective suicide prevention at a local level relies on the systematic analysis of local data \(a practice known as suicide audit\) in order to inform local action planning. In an NIHR CLAHRC\-sponsored study, we surveyed all public health teams in England to find out how they were conducting suicide audit and how the resulting data were being used. We found that many teams were investing large amounts of time and effort in collecting data but were unable to show how it informed their suicide prevention plan, or that it had resulted in specific actions **\[3.3\]**. 

 **2.1c **Review of local suicide prevention plans.** Leading on from Study 2.1b, in partnership with *Samaritans* we won a contract from PHE to conduct an analysis of all 152 local authority suicide prevention plans, identify good practice and areas requiring improvement, and develop a set of quality standards. We showed that, whilst there was a high level of ambition and commitment on the part of local authorities to address all areas of the national strategy, many of them were struggling to implement their action plans, especially in the context of local budget cuts and a lack of centralised resources **\[3.4\]**. 

 **2.2 Helping everyone play a part in preventing suicides.** 

 It is widely acknowledged that “Suicide prevention is everybody’s business”, but little is known about the part that lay people can play in it or the skills and resources they need in order to do so. Our research has filled this gap. We first sought to understand the difficulties people experience in recognising and responding to a suicidal crisis within different social settings. We then used the findings to develop a new generation of public health messages that take account of the everyday contexts in which people live, and we evaluated these. 

 **2.2a **Developing and evaluating a public education leaflet:** ‘ **It’s safe to talk about suicide’.** Exeter research has shown that family members and friends of those who were suicidal struggled to pick up warning signs; and when they did, they judged intervention to be highly risky and avoided talking about suicide for fear of triggering adverse reactions and damaging relationships. Working with *The Alliance of Suicide Prevention Charities* \(TASC\) and a panel of people bereaved by suicide \(2013\-14\), we developed a public education leaflet that specifically addressed these fears. In partnership with our local public health team, we distributed 15,000 copies throughout Devon via a wide range of community agencies, and followed these up to evaluate its utility, acceptability and perceived safety **\[3.5\]**. The evaluation showed the leaflet was filling an important gap in public information provision and was eagerly embraced by frontline staff and volunteers, who were passing it on to clients, using it for their own education and development, or using it as a teaching aid **\[3.5\]**. 

 **2.2b **The role of passing strangers in preventing suicides in public places.** Previous research on preventing suicides in public places has mainly focused on the effectiveness of installing physical barriers at high\-risk sites. In 2015, we formed a new strategic partnership with Jonny Benjamin MBE, maker of the award\-winning Channel 4 documentary, *The Stranger on the Bridge.* In an MRC\-funded study \(2017\-18; £122,959.00; PI: Owens\) we examined the role of passing strangers. We interviewed 12 people who had been prevented by a stranger from taking their life in a public place, and 21 who had intervened to prevent someone from doing so. From this study we identified the core components of an effective intervention and developed a set of clear public education messages to empower people to recognise and reach out to someone in crisis in a public place **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 *Our REF2014 impact case study presented the development of the first national guidance on the prevention of suicides in public places \(Guidance on action to be taken at suicide hotspots. NIMHE, 2006\) and its subsequent global impact. The current impact case study is based on both new research and entirely new claimed impacts that have occurred since August 2013.* 

 In the UK, over 6,000 people die by suicide each year.  It is a leading cause of death for young people, has higher rates among those from deprived backgrounds, and devastates the families and communities of each individual who takes their own life. 

 **4.1 Informing national public health policy and supporting local authority practice.** 

 **4.1a **Preventing suicides in public places.** Owens’ national guidance **\[3.2\]** has been used to inform the management of high\-risk suicide locations. In 2015, this national guidance on preventing suicides in public places, was distributed to every public health team and local planning department \(n=152\] in England along with a letter from the Secretary of State for Health **\[5.1\]**. The framework in Owens’ guidance subsequently led to local authorities drawing up site\-specific action plans **\[5.2\]** and by 2019, 78% of local authorities had specific actions to reduce suicides in public places included in their suicide prevention plan, and 64% \(97/150\) reported that these actions were already being delivered **\[5.2\]**, **\[3.4\]**. Consequently, public health leads in 16 English local authorities contacted Owens for advice on the management of particular high\-risk locations. Furthermore, Stoke\-on\-Trent City Council has worked with Owens to develop specific guidance for developers and the construction industry **\[5.2\]**. 

 **Private and voluntary sector**: Many suicide attempts are made on impulse, so considering suicide risk when designing buildings is critical. Owens advised Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd on the design of high\-rise buildings in the City of London and ROSPA on the design of student residences at the University of Exeter. In addition, Owens advised the National Trust on measures to reduce suicide risk at cliff\-top locations such as closing a section of footpath or fencing off a stretch of cliff. This research\-based advice to these various organisations was subsequently used as a model for new national guidance in both Scotland and Ireland. Highways England also subsequently used it as the basis for its strategy and guidance for preventing suicides on the strategic road network **\[5.3\]**. 

 The University of Exeter *Stranger on the Bridge* study was used to develop a training module, and since March 2019 it has been delivered to every traffic officer in England \(n=2,000\) **\[5.4\]**. In September 2018, it also directly informed three of the recommendations within NICE Guideline 105: *Preventing suicide in community and custodial settings* **\[5.5\]**. The recommendations were: increased use of CCTV or other surveillance to allow staff to monitor when someone may need help; increasing the number and visibility of staff, or times when staff are available, and; ensuring training is available for relevant people. 

 **4.1b **Utility of suicide audit.** Owens’ guidance contributed to a significant upturn in the development of suicide prevention plans in local authorities. The Exeter research was identified as a seminal study and heavily cited in a report by the 2015 *All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Suicide and Self\-Harm Prevention* on the future of local suicide prevention plans **\[5.6\]**. The APPG report led PHE to commission the 2016 *Local suicide prevention planning: a practice resource*, and Owens was invited to play a key role in its development **\[5.6\]**. This guidance was distributed to every local public health team in England \(n=152\) **\[5.7\]**. A 2016 survey by PHE indicated that the number of local authorities with a plan in place or in development had increased from 70% in Jan 2015 to 95% in Jan 2017 **\[5.7\]**. 

 **4.1c **Review of local suicide prevention plans.** 

 Exeter research \(study **2.1**\) raised the quality of local suicide prevention work in Local Authorities. The findings and recommendations from Owens’ report **\[3.4\]** “feed directly into this sector\-led improvement programme” for suicide prevention \(Background section of **\[5.8\]**\). This is a £600,000 Sector\-Led Improvement programme, launched in 2018 and coordinated by the Local Government Association. During 2020, the programme delivered national masterclasses/webinars on key issues, a Must\-Know Guide, and provided bespoke expert support for local authorities identified as facing particular challenges **\[5.8\]** *.* 

 **4.2: Helping everyone play a part in preventing suicides.** 

 The leaflet’s message ‘It’s safe to talk about suicide’ has empowered friends and family members to overcome their fears and initiate conversations about suicide. 

 **4.2a Public education leaflet: ‘It’s safe to talk about suicide’.** Exeter research revealed a deep\-seated fear of talking about suicide. Significant others can play a key role in suicide prevention, but little attention was given to the resources they may need to do so effectively. The evaluation of our leaflet distribution evidenced that it was a vital information resource. This resulted in Devon County Council producing a further 30,000 hard copies which were distributed across the county through frontline agencies and community groups, including housing and benefits departments, GPs, student wellbeing services, Citizens Advice and family solicitors. Since 2016, it has been made available online through the National Suicide Prevention Alliance \(NSPA\)’s repository of approved resources. Also in 2016, in response to widespread demand, the leaflet was made free to share and adapt under a Creative Commons Licence. Organisations have endorsed it with their own logo and are actively distributing it, including eight local authorities besides Devon, five UK universities, the Fire Officers Association, and the RNLI **\[5.9\]**. It is promoted in Universities UK’s guidance on the creation of Suicide\-Safer Universities \(UUK, 2018\) and Business in the Community’s guidance for employers \(BITC, 2017\). In 2019 it was also translated for use by local health teams in Malaysia **\[5.9\]**. 

 **4.2b **Informing national campaigns**: In 2015, the leaflet’s key messages and content formed the basis for a \# *BiggerIssues* campaign by the *Campaign Against Living Miserably* \(CALM\), estimated to have reached over 23 million people via social media, and in 2016 for the \#TalkThroughTheTaboo campaign by PAPYRUS \(Prevention of Young Suicide\) **\[5.10\]**.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The <ins>underpinning research adopted a life\-course perspective focused on how young people/adults can be supported to</ins> <ins>sidestep</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>or develop coping strategies to move aw</ins><ins>ay from</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>anti\-social, violent and</ins> <ins>addictive behaviour.</ins> The research had five sub\-themes, each one led by a key researcher: 

 **Sub\-theme 1: Spirituality, Gangs & Rehabilitation:** This highly innovative research was conducted by the team between 2014 and 2018 and it was partly funded by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland \(GBP2,776\) **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. It involved participant observation in four rehabilitation programmes within prisons/communities in key cities across **Europe**, the **USA** and **Asia**, as well as life history interviews with 54 male reforming/reformed gang members with an age span of 17\-60. The research explored the extent to and ways in which eclectic spiritual interventions could help to support negativistic masculine identities based on violent criminality to become supplanted by more positivistic masculine identities, and the relationship between this and the men’s commitment to criminal desistance. The findings suggested that engagement with the interventions gradually enabled the men to reject the dominant views of masculinity that had characterised their ascendency to criminal lifestyles, to begin to retreat from the gang identity and gain a new sense of status from narratives of recovery, generativity and countercultural frames of masculinity as identity markers. Although still marginalised and in a state of flux and transition, the men began to draw upon spiritual capital to transition away from offending lifestyles. The insights from the research have \(for instance\) helped to inform the interest in, and practice vision for, meditation\-based rehabilitation programmes among **Anglican Prison Chaplains in England**; to stimulate opportunities for reformed male offenders to become involved in the delivery of rehabilitation initiatives in **Denmark**; to effect peacemaking practitioners in England to progress to delivering spiritual\-based education workshops in English schools, colleges and prisons; to benefit the rehabilitation of men in Scottish prisons; and to inspire a Parliamentary debate on, and strategic commitment to, finding alternative strategies for violence reduction in Scotland. 

 **Sub\-theme 2: County Lines:** Between 2012 and 2018 the team conducted in\-depth semi\-structured interviews with 42 men and women aged between 16\-35 years in the west of Scotland, all of whom had been involved in gang\-related offending and organised crime **\[3.3\].** The findings provided insights into gang activity, drug harms/supply, and the presence of child criminal exploitation \(CCE\) within County Lines drug supply networks. Insights benefited practitioner services and police by providing recommendations for identifying the presence of, and implementing safeguarding practices to address, CCE. This was initiated via McLean’s media appearances and contributions to practitioner\-based events. 

 **Sub\-theme 3: Anti\-bullying:** The research on anti\-bullying **\[3.4\]**, funded by the Erasmus\+ programme of the European Commission \(GBP222,857\) between September 2017 and February 2020, developed a first\-of\-its\-kind whole\-school programme to prevent bullying motivated by prejudice against minorities. Despite increasing reports of racist bullying after the Brexit vote, no tailored programme to prevent this type of bullying existed in the UK and internationally. The programme was evaluated in the UK, the Netherlands, Greece and Slovakia with 578 children and was found to change attitudes towards ethnic minorities in mixed schools **.** 

 **Sub\-theme 4: Policing Youth**: Funded by Glasgow City Council and Police Scotland \(GBP22,987\), the research **\[3.5\]** was brokered through the Scottish Institute for Policing Research \(SIPR\). The work was concerned – although not exclusively – with developing a clearer understanding of how the police and their community partners can better address youth violence and antisocial behaviour in local communities, including schools. Research involved numerous observations, focus groups and interviews with youths and young adults, community representatives, the police and community partners. The research also drew on the work of campus officers, and early and effective interventions to support individuals in making positive life choices. The insights helped to inform and benefit Police Scotland to enable the strengthening of partnership working and community\-oriented approaches to preventing youth violence. 

 **Sub\-theme 5: Drugs Recovery:** This final element of the research underpinning the impact **\[3.6\]** built on a body of work on how stigma and discrimination increase risk factors for drug\-related death, and how this negatively impacts on recovery from problem substance misuse, particularly among young, poor and disenfranchised groups. Utilising a critical multi\-theoretical and multi\-methodological *bricoleur* approach to inquiry, the authors documented how ‘hidden’ drug use differs from the use of ‘known or captured offenders’ visible to criminal justice bureaucracies and treatment agencies, with findings contributing to address and effect change in stigma and offending within the context of human rights and social justice.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This highly innovative research has had an impact on practice and people’s lives; it has influenced policy; and it has generated public engagement – all of which has helped to improve the support available to vulnerable young people and adults to help them make positive life changes. 

 **Impact on Practice & People’s Lives** 

 The research under sub\-theme 1 has had a strong influence on helping to reshape practitioners’ rehabilitation vision and on influencing reformed offenders’ lives. The practice vision of HM Prison and Probation Service \(Chaplaincy and Faith Services\) became strongly influenced by Deuchar’s contribution from his international research insights on the impact of meditation as a rehabilitation tool \(Sub\-theme 1\) **\[3.1\]**, delivered at the Anglican Prison Chaplains’ conference in Derby, England, in 2018. The Chaplaincy HQ Advisor stated that **Deuchar’s** contribution had a real *‘resonance with the Chaplains’* and that ‘ *the practical engagement with aspects of meditation was a revelation and … generated real interest about how such an intervention might be established \[in prisons\]’* **\[5.1\]**. Reaching out to a practitioner audience at an International Association for Human Values \(IAHV\) conference in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, in 2018, included one of Deuchar’s former research participants, a reformed gang member who had engaged in the Danish spiritual intervention he had researched \(‘Breathe Smart/Prison Smart’\). The latter demonstrated the way in which he had benefited from the partnership between Deuchar and members of the ‘Breathe Smart’ organisation and now *‘facilitate\[ed\] the exit of those wishing to leave gang life*’ across **Denmark \[5.1\]**. During a public seminar held at the Scottish Parliament \(also in 2018\), sponsored by the MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden & Depute Convenor of Scottish Parliament’s Justice Committee and hosted by Deuchar and his two invited speakers from the ‘Breathe Smart’ organisation in Denmark, another former offender from Denmark \(and former research participant of Deuchar’s\) spoke passionately about the way in which his life had been turned around as a result of dynamic breathing and meditation **\[5.3\].** The opportunity to transition from research participant to public speaker in a different country later provided him with the impetus to train to become a ‘Breathe Smart’ teacher and he now helps to lead rehabilitation programmes in Danish prisons and communities **\[5.3\].** Public ‘lightening talks’ on international spiritual innovations, delivered by Deuchar to a collective audience of over 500 practitioners and members of the public as part of International Peace Day celebrations held at Kidderminster College and Darlington Street Methodist Church, England, in 2019, had an effect on the practice of **Midlands Peacemakers** \(overall coordinators of the celebrations\). According to Midlands Peacemakers, Deuchar’s ‘ *input and inspiration at \[the\] events were strongly felt and instrumental in helping us to progress*’. As a result, the organisation has gone on to deliver ‘ *innovative workshops in schools and colleges as well as in prisons’* \[focused on spirituality\] **\[5.2\].** Further, Deuchar’s research \(sub\-theme 1\) has also helped to inform the design and delivery of spiritual\-oriented support sessions for both men in prison and disadvantaged youth. In the winter of 2019\-20, a series of meditation and dynamic, three\-stage ‘pranayama’ breathing workshops, were implemented by Deuchar in two Scottish prisons, attended by men within the context of drug recovery cafés coordinated by Sustainable Interventions Supporting Change Outside \(SISCO\). These workshops were informed by Deuchar’s research, particularly his fieldwork conducted in Denmark. The Director of SISCO commented these sessions *‘made substantial impacts on prisoners’ ability to deal with the many stresses of prison life, and have proven beneficial to café members who are reducing on Opioid Replacement Therapy \(ORT\) medications*. *As a result, this has had a direct impact on prison rehabilitation enabling many of the men to become more ready to transition back into the community’* **\[5.4\].** Similar sessions were delivered for young people in Mirren Park School in Paisley, where the Head of Education highlighted that the ‘ *programmes delivered by Prof Deuchar have had a positive impact on the pupils and have added value to our curriculum offer*’. The latter comment refers to the way in which the school subsequently adopted mindfulness and breathing workshops into the curriculum to benefit the pupils, all of whom are socially disadvantaged and many of whom have suffered from childhood trauma **\[5.4\].** Deuchar also drew upon the insights from his participant observation of spiritually\-based intervention programmes, insights from his work in Scottish prisons and subsequent practitioner training he completed with **Mindfulness Scotland** to deliver a series of meditation and breathing\-focused support webinars for Scottish public sector practitioners during Mental Health Awareness Week \(May 2020\), Stress Awareness week \(November 2020\) and for UWS business partners throughout the Covid\-19 lockdown period during 2020. 

 Several other impacts on practice have been achieved. As a result of **McLean’s** \(Sub\-theme 2\) involvement in BBC radio interviews, his invited keynotes at Barnardo’s annual conference, and an annual policing event at Cumberland Lodge with related reports on organised crime and CCE, recommendations for implementing ‘wrap around services’ have been taken forward by several different **police departments in England and Wales**. Notable changes to police practice now include the involvement of external organisations alongside police at times of carrying out warranted arrests on identified County Lines operations, as opposed to involvement afterwards. Reports for the **Youth Offending Team \(YOT\)** in Newcastle and the charity Cumberland Lodge by McLean have led to the implantation of wider theme\-based programmes being run by the YOT aimed at individual experiences. Likewise, the use of ‘hotlines’ for the most persistent offenders was also implanted whereby they can access ‘mentors’ in times of crisis. Other improvements to YOT practices include greater distribution of administrative roles away from frontline workers to backroom staff **\[5.5, 5.6\].** Under Sub\-theme 3, the national anti\-bullying campaign, ‘Choose Respect’, which was rolled out across Scottish schools and youth organisations from November 2018 to June 2019, was developed as a result of **Sapouna’s** activity\-based campaign resources. As stated by Scotland’s national anti\-bullying service: ‘ *The resources have been viewed over 1,600 times since published in March 2019. In total, 93% of the campaign evaluation survey respondents said they felt the building empathy resources were either extremely or very helpful in supporting improved understanding of empathy among young people*’ **\[5.7\].** The research Sub\-theme 4 led by **Frondigoun** has had a positive effect on policing approaches in Ayrshire, strengthening the focus on partnership working, and on early intervention and prevention as opposed to punitive enforcement. According to Police Scotland: Frondigoun’s work has been ‘ *influential in … helping to develop and improve longer\-term policing practice in Ayrshire …* \[and\] *been referenced in ongoing discussions within Police Scotland’s “Safer Communities”, which has the strategic lead for developing partnership working and prevention for the Service nationally*’ **\[5.8\].** Additionally, following the release of the evaluation report on Campus Officers’ work, she was invited to join a Police Scotland working group on campus officers by the then ACC Mr McCormack. The Sub\-theme 5 research by **McPhee**, which has been pioneering in terms of helping to shape drug and alcohol policy and rights\-based approaches in recovery work in Scotland **\[5.9, 5.10\],** has altered police practices, evidenced by the decrease in numbers of successful prosecutions for possession with intent to supply from 5,423 to 3,973 between 2010 and 2018 \(Scottish Government, *Recorded crime in Scotland: 2018\-2019*\) \(see further detail under ‘Policy Impact\). McPhee, as the UWS lead with **Elevate**, attracted funding \(GBP10,417\) to Glasgow Council on Alcohol \(GCA\) and Elevate, to allow individuals in recovery find work placement experiences and international travel via the Erasmus programme, of which UWS is a partner organisation. McPhee’s approach to reducing stigma led to him working with the Scottish Recovery Consortium \(SRC\). McPhee’s report, funded by GCA, evaluating the impact of rights\-based advocacy in the context of recovery, led to the commissioning of training for rights\-based advocacy workers, to be rolled out to Local Authorities and Alcohol and Drug Partnerships \(ADP\). 

 **Policy impact** 

 The Scottish Parliament initiated a debate and continued strategy changes as a result of the pioneering work on the impact of spiritual\-based rehabilitation programmes \(Sub\-theme 1\). As above, in the autumn of 2018 Deuchar held a public seminar at the Parliament in collaboration with the ‘ **Breathe Smart’ organisation in Denmark**, where research insights were shared into the impact of meditation programs on Danish offenders **\[3.1, 3.2\]** \(see also earlier sub\-section on ‘Impact on Practice & People’s Lives’\). The event was sponsored by the MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden & Depute Convenor of **Scottish Parliament’s Justice Committee** and was attended by over 40 practitioners, policy\-makers and MSPs. The MSP commented that the event was *‘one of the most inspiring and intensive events I have held in Parliament and gave a whole new perspective into prison reform and offenders’ rehabilitation, which I personally would like to see introduced into the Scottish Prison Service’* **\[5.3\].** The event led to the MSP initiating a Scottish Parliamentary briefing and debate on violence reduction strategies in November 2018 and to declare the need for finding *‘alternatives to reducing violent behaviour and reoffending’.* The final report on developments in organised crime and CCE in drug dealing practices by McLean \(Sub\-theme 2\) was commended by **Cumberland Lodge**, who stated that the ‘ *report was … excellent … and shared widely with senior police officers, charity leaders, policymakers and students across the UK*’ **\[5.6\].** This laid the foundation for policy change by the **UK Government** in relation to safeguarding practices \(as above\) where social work, and public and third sector organisations are now involved in the dismantling of County Lines drug dealing operations throughout England and Wales. The research in Sub\-theme 5 led by McPhee has challenged dominant crime and pathology discourses underpinning drug prohibition in Scotland. McPhee’s critique of the disparity in prosecutions for drug dealing in Scotland **\[3.6\]** was used in ‘Op Ed’ pieces in ‘Resident Advisor’, ‘Vice’ magazine and dissemination in ‘The National’, the ‘Daily Record’ and at conferences. As an expert witness, MPhee’s work challenged the police perspective on using prosecutions for drug dealing as a performance indicator; as a result, Police Scotland became less focused on this policy, leading to fewer prosecutions \(as above\). McPhee’s membership in various committees led to the 2018 drug and alcohol strategy ‘Rights, Respect and Recovery’ being underpinned by a human rights approach to treatment and recovery **\[5.9, 5.10\].** 

 **Public engagement impact** 

 Sub\-theme 1 within the collective research \(key researcher: Deuchar\) has spawned a number of ‘Op Eds’ in national newspapers such as ‘The Herald’, ‘The Scotsman’ and ‘TES Scotland’ \[2016\-19\], and a TV appearance on the **Channel 5 documentary ‘Britain’s Crime Capitals’** \[during the data collection phase, 2015\]. The latter was subsequently uploaded onto Deuchar’s YouTube channel and to date has attracted 191,000 views. The release of Deuchar’s 2018 book **\[3.1\]** led to a live appearance on the **BBC R4 programme ‘Thinking Allowed’** \[2018\]. The latter subsequently became part of an official Podcast uploaded on BBC Radio 4’s website, which attracts regular public views. Combined with wider dissemination on social media \(particularly Twitter, where Deuchar has over 2,700 followers\), this collectively has led to vociferous public debate around issues of gangs/violence and spirituality as a tool for desistance. Research sub\-theme 2 \(key researcher: McLean\) has also resulted in over 20 media appearances, including data being directly used by other reports and authors in the media; opinion pieces in ‘The Herald’, the ‘Independent’ and ‘Glasgow Live’; live discussions on the radio, including the BBC; and a TV appearance for a **BBC documentary on ‘The Tinder Generation’**. Further, research sub\-theme 5 \(key researcher: McPhee\) has generated several requests for expert commentary in news media, both nationally and internationally, in ‘Op Ed’ expert opinion pieces in press and on BBC Radio Scotland. It also led to a film for **Il Giorno**, and a letter to the ‘Lancet’. McPhee recently evaluated survey data capturing over 4,500 young people, documenting the needs of young people not in contact with formal treatment services, linking with a national treatment provider ‘We Are With You’ \(WAWY\). As a result, WAWY is adapting online services to address this unmet need.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The impact described derives from two sources: a Randomized Controlled Trial \(RCT\) of long\-term psychodynamic psychotherapy \(LTPP\) for treatment resistant depression \(TRD\), which showed significant positive outcomes at 2 year follow\-up; and research addressing the complexities of evaluating psychological therapies for long\-term conditions. 

 Two domains of impacts are claimed. Firstly, the RCT findings were used to inform European and American guideline recommendations. Secondly, related psychological therapy outcome research led the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) to commit to a change in approach to analysis of long\-term outcome data and quality\-of\-life/functioning outcomes for the depression guideline update \(now due 2022\). Essex research shows that analysis of these outcomes will lead to changes in the range of psychological therapies recommended for people with depression to choose from. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Long\-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for adults \(used for a wide range of mental health diagnoses including depression\) has been available within the NHS since its inception, yet lacked a formal evidence base in the form of RCTs. In 1998, the Tavistock Clinic \(an NHS provider of LTPP\) and the University of Essex appointed a joint Chair \(Richardson\) to lead a programme of outcome research in LTPP. Richardson, a leading outcomes researcher in Psychological Therapies \(PTs\), undertook and contributed to the development of methodologies for evaluating PTs \[R1, R2\]. 

 Richardson and McPherson completed a systematic review of PTs for Treatment Resistant Depression \(TRD\) \[R3\] which identified key methodological limitations of existing TRD efficacy research including the limited availability of long\-term follow\-up and quality\-of\-life/functioning \(QOL/F\) data. These omissions are significant given a. the extremely chronic nature of TRD, defined as a minimum of 2 years, but in practice 2\-29 years \[R4\]; b. QOL/F outcomes \(as opposed to symptom outcomes\) are more closely aligned with patient recovery \[R5\]. McPherson and Richardson re\-reviewed RCTs of PTs reviewed in the NICE 2004 depression guideline by QOL/F outcomes. This demonstrated that a focus on QOL/F outcomes produces different review findings: effect sizes of certain PTs recommended by NICE reduce and the effects of certain other PTs not recommended by NICE become apparent \[R5\]. 

 Supported by McPherson, Richardson designed and led an RCT based at the Tavistock Clinic which examined the efficacy of LTPP for TRD and which ran from 2002\-2015 \[R6\]. On Richardson’s death \(2007\), McPherson, who was the lead researcher co\-ordinating the RCT until 2007, remained involved as a collaborating researcher until completion. The completed RCT \[R7\] was the first RCT of LTPP in the NHS and was unique among RCTs for persistent forms of depression in its duration of follow\-up \(2\-years post\-treatment\). Inclusion criteria required participants \(N=129\) to have moderate or severe depression as well as complex personality and/or psycho\-social difficulties, meaning the sample was more clinically complex than is typical in RCTs of PTs for depression. 

 Key findings were: 

 **Symptom outcomes**: at end\-of\-treatment \(once weekly for 18 months\), there was no benefit over treatment\-as\-usual for LTPP on symptom outcomes \(ES=0.2\). However, positive treatment effects \(on symptoms\) were evident at 2 years after end\-of\-treatment: ES=0.63. 

 **QOL/F outcomes**: the mean score of the General Assessment of Functioning Scale \(GAF\) at baseline was 49 \(serious impairment\). The LTPP group mean GAF score at 2\-year follow\-up was 60 \(borderline moderate\-mild impairment\). There were statistically significant differences between the LTPP and treatment\-as\-usual group at end\-of\-treatment and at 2\-year follow\-up on the GAF with the effect size increasing between end\-of\-treatment and 2\-year follow\-up. The same pattern occurred with the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. 

 Of 124 RCTs reviewed by NICE in the most recent draft update to the depression guideline, for either TRD or chronic depression, only 11 had post\-treatment follow\-up data of 6 months or more \[R4\]. Of these, the Tavistock RCT had the longest follow\-up. Further examination of pre\-post effect sizes \(for symptoms\) at follow\-up for these 11 RCTs demonstrates that many \(but not all\) PTs become more effective at follow\-up \[R4\]. LTPP is one such PT that becomes more effective at follow\-up \[R4\]. 

 Note that there is ongoing work to examine the cost\-effectiveness of LTPP for TRD. A cost\-effectiveness evaluation of a recent UK based RCT of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for TRD \(the “COBALT” trial\) found an incremental cost\-effectiveness ratio of GBP 14,911 \(see Wiles et al 2014 – HTA report \[S3a\]\). While the cost of treatment in the Tavistock LTPP RCT is likely to be 3\-4 times that in the COBALT trial, this is counterbalanced by the LTPP sample being a more chronic, severe and costly group \(including lost work and high levels of informal care\) at baseline \(see McCrone et al 2017 \[S3b\]\). Taking these factors into account, the cost of treatment for patients with the more intransigent low functioning forms of depression as seen in the Tavistock RCT are likely to be within the NICE range of cost\-effectiveness.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **1\) <ins>The RCT results were used to inform European and American depression guideline recommendations**</ins> 

 The long\-term outcomes reported in the Tavistock RCT \[R7\] are the basis of recommendations for LTPP for TRD in the following guidelines: 

-  European Psychiatric Association \(EPA\) guideline on PTs for persistent forms of depression \[S1a\] 

-  American Psychological Association \(APA\) guideline for depression \[S1b\] 

-  European Community based Mental Health Service Providers \(EUCOMS\) Network \[S1c\] 

 The EPA guideline used the Tavistock RCT \[R7\] to conclude that “ *both observer\-based and self\-reported depression scores showed steeper declines in the LTPP group, alongside greater improvements on measures of social adjustment. These data suggest that LTPP can be useful in improving the long\-term outcome of treatment\-resistant depression*” \[S1a\]. The guideline recommends LTPP as a third\-line treatment. The recommendation could not be first\- or second\-line because the Tavistock RCT was “ *published after closure of literature search and not included into database for evidence grading and the Delphi process*”. The EPA has 44 National Psychiatric Association members representing over 80,000 psychiatrists across Europe. The EPA collaborates with WHO Europe and the EU Compass project to promote evidence\-based practice in member states informed by its portfolio of peer\-reviewed published guidelines. 

 EUCOMS, comprising 61 organisations from 21 countries, used the Tavistock RCT \[R7\] as a basis for recommending psychodynamic psychotherapy as an evidence\-based treatment for community mental health care \[S1b\]. 

 The APA 2019 guideline \[S1c\] was developed based on systematic reviews only \(rather than reviewing primary research\). Of the systematic reviews included, one was on the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapies \[S1d\] and was the source for several statements about LTPP in the guideline. The conclusions in this review concerning LTPP for depression were based solely on the Tavistock RCT \[R7\]. The APA guideline recommends psychodynamic psychotherapies as an option among first and second\-line treatments; it notes that “ *psychotherapies seem to have longer term effects*” and that “ *LTPP relative to treatment\-as\-usual \(which could include antidepressant medication\) may have similar effects as well*” \(p55\-6\). It also notes “ *some evidence suggests that effects of some psychotherapies persist longer than the effects of medication*” \(p88\).  The APA is the registration and accrediting body for clinical psychologists in the US and has 121,000 members. 

 **2\) <ins>Essex research led NICE to commit to a change in approach to analysis of long\-term outcome data and quality\-of\-life/functioning outcomes for the depression guideline update \(due 2022\).**</ins> 

 In February 2017 McPherson was invited to speak at the Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the NHS ‘Annual Phil Richardson Memorial Lecture’ \[S2a\]. In this talk McPherson anticipated some of the methodological issues that might arise in the forthcoming draft of the NICE depression guideline and encouraged mental health professional bodies concerned with these methodological issues to work together to identify and raise key concerns with NICE jointly and constructively \[S2a\]. 

 The 2017/8 consultation drafts of the guideline had analysed end\-of\-treatment symptom outcomes only. The recommendations concerning PTs for depression were therefore based on end\-of treatment symptom outcomes, which concerned several professional bodies because this significantly narrowed the choice of therapies that will be made available for patients to choose among \(which is important because patient choice and preference is known to impact on outcomes\). McPherson engaged with various professional bodies and patient organisations, supporting them to engage jointly with NICE around key methodological issues, thus influencing and shaping the debate around guideline methodologies concerning PTs for depression. This resulted in: 

-  Key stakeholders \(Royal College of Psychiatrists \[RCPsych\], British Psychoanalytic Association and Society for Psychotherapy Research UK\) cited Essex research \[including R3, R4 and R7\] in their stakeholder responses to NICE’s 2017 consultation draft. Citing this Essex research, RCPsych specifically requested that functional outcomes be given more priority \[S2b p259\-60\] and that “ *Proper weight should be given to outcomes reported at long\-term follow\-ups/observation periods, where these are available, rather than exclusively treatment endpoint*.” \[S2b p416\] 

-  McPherson was invited to co\-author \(with the President of the Society for Psychotherapy Research UK\) a joint stakeholder response to a second stakeholder consultation \[S2c\]. This was signed by 14 organisations \(including the RCPsych, MIND, UK Council for Psychotherapy, British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and National Survivor User Network\) plus 6 individuals \(including Prof Sir Simon Wessely and Prof Clare Gerada MBE\), submitted June 2018. This was resubmitted to NICE in May 2019, having been signed by 40 organisations \(now including the British Psychological Society and Association for Clinical Psychologists\) plus 53 individuals. The response highlighted 6 methodological issues, including the importance of examining long\-term outcomes and QOL/F outcomes because of the importance of these outcomes to patients and because prioritising these outcomes in developing recommendations would lead to greater patient choice of PTs \[R4, R5\] \[S2c p7,17\]. 

-  McPherson attended and took a key role in stakeholder discussions with NICE executives \(including Sir Andrew Dillon and Paul Chrisp\), to explore methodological issues \(April 2018 and May 2019\) \[S2d\]. Subsequently, in December 2019, NICE confirmed their response to these discussions \[S2e\]. NICE committed to a substantial new programme of work to address stakeholder methodological concerns. Concerning long\-term outcomes NICE stated: *“NICE will now include long\-term follow\-up data in all its treatment reviews. The committee has previously considered that long\-term follow up data were not available across all comparisons of interests in the guideline and consequently long\-term effectiveness would be subject to large potential biases. However, we accept that long\-term effectiveness is an important outcome and we will now look for it in all treatment reviews*.” Stating similar reasons, NICE also committed to *“include quality of life and functional status as outcomes in the treatment reviews”*. \[S2e\] The third consultation draft including this additional work is now due in May 2022. Essex research shows that analysis of QOL/F outcomes \[R5\] and long\-term outcomes \[R4\] will change the range of PTs recommended and therefore made available to people presenting with depression.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 UoP research has led to the development and implementation of water management technologies. New treatment technologies and site modelling implemented by a major UK water company improved wastewater treatment performance giving enhanced environmental protection and substantial cost savings.  Increased performance of novel and enhanced package sewage treatment plants has reduced cost and stimulated commercial growth of SMEs. Research on blue\-green water management systems has informed policy, improved environmental protection and provided commercial benefits to industrial collaborators. Lastly, novel soil washing technology has been developed and applied to achieve large scale hydrocarbon remediation at industrial sites. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UoP research has led to the development and implementation of novel wastewater technologies. Research is undertaken at our unique Environmental Technology Field Station \(ETFS\) or at real\-world sites to understand wastewater treatment processes through a combination of fundamental science and engineering approaches. The body of research underpinning the impact is across four technologies in particular: 

-  Conventional Small waste\-water treatment works \(WwTW\) 

-  Package treatment plants 

-  Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) 

-  Novel materials in combination with natural systems for wastewater treatment 

 The team apply a range of approaches, for example: focusing on specific pollutants \(e.g. phosphorous, hydrocarbons\), optimising design and operation, and/or demonstrating the efficacy of technologies in real\-world settings. 

 The UoP ETFS is a unique facility located at a waste\-water treatment works which was extensively upgraded in 2015 with a UoP investment of over GBP150,000.  Pumped sewage supplies from various WwTW stages allow research at operationally relevant pilot\-plant scales.  Test bed facilities, including a 20m greenhouse and dedicated laboratories, also allow environmental technologies and monitoring to be assessed at scales and intensities relevant to real world applications.  The overarching objective of the multidisciplinary research is to characterise high variable environmental technologies and systems with extensive multivariate monitoring. This alongside detailed mechanistic studies contribute to the design and operation codes for improving the performance of environmental technologies. 

 Research using large\-scale pilot plants at the ETFS currently involves industrial collaborations with the regional water utility Southern Water \(SW\) \(G1\) and WPL Ltd \(G3, G4\). Research with SW encompasses several technologies that address their current Research & Development \(R&D\) concerns such as increasing the technological options for phosphorus \(P\) removal from effluents, especially at their hundreds of small waste water treatment plants.  Discharge consents are becoming more strict and commonly used options to mitigate negative environmental impacts at large sites, such as chemical \(ferric\) dosing, pose significant operational challenges at smaller sites, making the same interventions economically unsustainable. A potential alternative is to use granular materials that can remove P from wastewater, utilising mechanisms such as precipitation and adsorption, through passive filters.  A key piece of research with SW has therefore been improving the understanding of the kinetics of phosphorous attachment to these “reactive media” through large\-scale long\-term comparative studies of different media, using real sewage, rather than laboratory simulations \(G2\).  This has highlighted the interaction of uptake rates and ultimate uptake capacity over various flow regimes and hydraulic residence times. This has been augmented by characterisation of deposits using advanced imaging and analysis techniques at the UoP \(XRD, XRF, SEM\-EDAX\) to inform understanding of the mechanisms and potential for nutrient recovery \(R1\).  Some of these materials increase effluent pH, so passive pH correction experiments have also been undertaken to allow these effluents to be released.  Other studies with SW have examined immobilised bacteria for P removal and novel methods for optimising and diagnosing WwTW operations, based on modelling and analysis of historic data to improve treatment performance and inform future treatment requirements \(R2\). 

 Collaborative R&D with WPL has been in operation throughout this REF period \(G3, G4\). WPL Ltd provide a range of products and services to the water sector including  “package” wastewater treatment plants, where a series of processes in one container provide treatment solutions typically used at small WwTP or where mains sewerage is not available. The application of these technologies are deployed around the world in low, middle and high income countries. Their long established submerged aerated filter range has been refined through a series of monitoring full\-scale units installed at the ETFS and operated under modified aeration patterns and various internal configurations.  This has informed the development of numerical models to develop optimised aeration and design strategies to reduce energy use. 

 The group has a >40 year track record of research into blue\-green water technologies in the UK and overseas, particularly focussed on using wetland plants to promote treatment \(R3, R4, R5, R6\).  In addition, our focus on wetlands has extended to Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) and the research at the ETFS has focussed on characterising pollutant removal in vegetated systems. The international consultancy Mott MacDonald and the Highways Agency funded a study of detention ponds to manage flows and treat runoff from trunk roads.  This assessed treatment performance and the fate of metals and hydrocarbons, through intensive multivariate monitoring of field systems. This characterised accumulation rates and speciation of metals that were uncertain at the time and key to long term management and performance \(R4\).  Research into the treatment performance of SuDS in housing developments \(with infrastructure consultancy Mayer Brown Ltd and the Environment Agency\) demonstrated the pollutant removal capacity of swales and vegetated ponds, particularly for metals and hydrocarbons \(G5, G6\).  Following these field studies, modelling studies used computational fluid dynamics to examine how pond geometry can enhance sedimentation, and the understanding of Poly\-cyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon removal rates in swales was enhanced through monitoring a 10m greenhouse model fed with simulated storms mimicking polluted road runoff.  The various economic, policy and social barriers to SuDS uptake in England were investigated in a NERC Green Infrastructure Innovation project, ProSuDS \(R5, G7\), which included evaluation of residents’ perceptions \(R5\).  Studies of hydrocarbon treatment in SuDS have also been extended to phytoremediation studies of contaminated land \(R6, G8\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Introduction** 

 Research undertaken at the ETFS has underpinned the development and application of novel wastewater technologies leading to significant commercial and environmental benefits within the REF period. This impact is demonstrated through five key strands: 

 1.            Improved performance and cost savings for a major UK water company; 

 2.            Influencing national policy for the implementation of SuDS; 

 3.            Economic growth and job creation for UK SMEs; 

 4.            Innovation and new product/service for Kuwaiti energy technology company; 

 5.            Environmental and amenity benefits through strands 2\-4. 

 **Background: Impact through industrial collaboration** 

 A major component of our impact has occurred through collaborative, industrially funded research investigating wastewater treatment mechanisms and performance.  Our research has provided an evidence base for improvements to the performance or efficiency of the technology, essentially underpinned by our research contributions that have led to a more complete understanding of the underlying treatment processes, and also the development of independently assessed evidence that can further support the adoption and commercialisation of the technology.  This is valuable for SME innovators, as the UK wastewater industry is traditionally risk adverse and requires robust evidence before adopting new technologies. 

 **Impact strand 1: Improved performance and cost savings for a major UK company** 

 The University’s long term strategic partnership with Southern Water \(SW\) led to “The Hub” being established at the ETFS in 2017. The University employs 2 dedicated full\-time scientific officers at The Hub to carry out research onsite and act as a bridge to the research expertise and facilities at the University of Portsmouth thus expanding the R&D capacity of SW.  This research has focussed on assessing phosphorus \(P\) removal from effluents, particularly for small WwTP where increasingly tight discharge consents challenge the efficacy and economic viability of conventional technologies.  Southern Water operates 367 WwTW, of which 224 serve <ins><</ins>2,000 people and 136 <ins><</ins>500. Installing the most common P solution, chemical dosing, could cost over GBP100,000 for each site requiring significant investment and increased costs for customers.  A number of technologies have been evaluated to increase SW’s approved list of options, to date this has involved practical research studies into treatment options for P removal such as enhanced dosing/coagulation, electrocoagulation and immobilised bacteria at both the laboratory and pilot plant scales. These studies have resulted in systematic technical reports used by SW in investment decisions and provided design guidance to SW’s Engineering and Technical Services informing in\-house design of WwTP. SW stated: **""Research outcomes and other support provided by The Hub have increased our options to meet future regulations and reduced our reliance on existing, highly expensive, solutions""** \(S1\). Furthermore, data from these and other studies conducted by the team underpinned new models that enabled simple visualisation of stress to wastewater treatment plan informing operation and capacity at WwTW.  This work led SW to a saving of GBP8,500,000 on plans for future investment. SW stated: **“The Hub provided an intensive monitoring campaign, analysis and calibration of modelling to assess process resilience in real time, which provided realised capital benefits of GBP8.5million**” \(S2\). SW has also benefited from the contributions that the publicity, conference presentations and academic papers resulting from the collaboration make to its Public Relations strategy, by demonstrating its commitment and investment in improving environmental performance and process efficiency to customers and regulators \(S2\). 

 **Impact Strand 2: Influencing national policy for the implementation of SuDS** 

 Our research in the use of wetlands and sustainable drainage systems \(SuDS\) has promoted the national use of nature\-based solutions for improving water management; adding to the stock of validated case studies that demonstrate the value of SuDS to policy makers and informing design guidance for pollutant removal.  This influenced the 2006 policy of the Highways Agency \(Design Manual for Roads and Bridges: Vegetated Drainage Systems for Highway Runoff \(DMRB HA 103/06 \(S3\)\), that has seen wider uptake of vegetated SuDS on the road network in the period 2013\-2020 \(S4\). Highways England stated: **“This work influenced our policy and informed past and current practice in relation to road runoff control in vegetated systems. Vegetated detention pond systems are now an integral part of highway design and the runoff management treatment providing enhanced environmental protection for many watercourses.”** Major infrastructure projects in this period \(e.g. A1, A14 improvements\) have included vegetated drainage systems designed in accordance with DMRB HA 103/06. 

 **Impact Strand 3: Economic growth and job creation for SMEs** 

 A number of SMEs have also exploited the research expertise and ETFS test facilities to develop novel package sewage treatment plants and improved performance, and therefore competitiveness of existing products.  The strongest example of this is the long term collaboration with WPL who, in addition to large scale installations for water utilities, provide package sewage treatment plants to homes and communities not connected to the main sewerage network. The company has used the outcomes of research collaboration to develop a novel package technology for sludge management and made several refinements to the design of the aeration systems of the HiPAF Submerged Aerated Filters that have maintained the competitiveness of this well established technology; WPL sell  >50 plants a year ranging in scale from 150 to 1,000 population.  WPL stated: **“The research has supported the growth and economic prosperity of a local SME contributing to over GBP3million of sales and an estimated 20 jobs in the supply chain.” \(S3\).  Another SME, Mayer Brown Ltd, exploited the outcomes of our SuDS research to secure new clients. Our research validated the performance of their vegetated SuDS designs in housing developments. This led to commercial benefits in the form of increased sales in the REF period \(estimated GBP300,000\) \(S5\). 

 **Impact strand 4: Innovative new product/service for Kuwaiti energy technology company** 

 The team developed expertise in green\-blue water technologies for the removal of hydrocarbons \(R6\). This expertise was developed further through a Kuwaiti government funded PhD that developed a novel soil washing technology using bio\-surfactants from natural products and ultrasound. This ex\-student has since patented the process in the US and Gulf States \(US10072469B2 \(S6\) and GC0006708 \(S7\)\).  The technology has been through several stages of scale\-up trials in collaboration with the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research.  The technology has been certified for full\-scale use by the Kuwait Oil Company and has so far remediated a decommissioned oil production facility and a refinery.  The technology is now being applied to other contaminated sites significantly contributing to environmental protection \(S8\). 

 **Impact strand 5:** **Environmental and amenity benefits** 

 In addition to the commercial and policy benefits there is a significant environmental benefit arising from the implementation of the technologies described in impact strands \(IS\) 2 to 4: SuDS built to design standard DMRB HA 103/06 in the period \(IS2\), small\-scale WwTP installed by WPL Ltd \(IS3\), and the two field sites for the novel hydrocarbon remediation \(IS4\). Benefits are reduced pollution, and enhanced ecological and amenity quality in natural water bodies.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Clinical and diagnostic services for medically underserved Amish communities in the United States have been transformed by research at the University of Exeter. The Amish have a high incidence of genetic disorders and lack medical insurance, reducing access to healthcare. The Exeter team characterised seven novel disorders and identified >150 conditions previously unrecognised in the community. The team then **designed and developed new genetic testing approaches**, which have been integrated into diagnostic laboratories serving Amish communities and internationally. **Educational programmes for the Amish** and healthcare service professionals have been developed by the research team, accompanied by online educational resources and printed disease specific brochures to share research findings. Together, this work has **increased diagnostic rates for genetic disease from <15% \(2013\) to >70% by 2020**, reduced hospitalisations, prevented major neurological and physical impairments, and enabled estimated **savings of >$100 million** in community healthcare costs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The North American Amish and Mennonites are rural\-living, inter\-related, Christian communities. The current population of >350,000 derive from \~3,000 European immigrants, with >160,000 residents in Ohio/Wisconsin/Indiana \(OWI\-Amish\) states where the Exeter research programme is primarily based. Marriages within the community have increased the frequency of certain genetic conditions, leading to a profound burden of inherited disease. In 2000, Professor Crosby established the Windows of Hope \(WoH\) Amish translational genomic research programme in Holmes County, Ohio. Since May 2013, following the relocation of lead academics Professor Crosby / Dr Baple to Exeter, the research programme has expanded across Ohio and into Wisconsin and Indiana, developing a focus on childhood developmental disorders. These studies have advanced scientific and medical understanding of genetic diseases in several important ways. 

 **2.1 Disease gene discovery**. 

 Seven novel inherited childhood developmental disorders have been molecularly and clinically characterised among the Amish, including: \(i\) a developmental brain overgrowth\-seizure disorder due to *KPTN* gene mutation, which has now been described in families worldwide. Mouse model and laboratory studies have identified a candidate licenced medication to reduce seizures and improve developmental outcomes **\[3.1\]**. \(ii\) a DNA repair disorder, similar to ataxia\-telangiectasia, which causes neurological degeneration and growth failure due to mutation of a gene called *PCNA* **\[3.2\].** \(iii\) a new form of childhood hereditary spastic paraplegia \(HSP\) due to GM2 synthase mutation, an enzyme crucial for lipid metabolism **\[3.3\]**. Together with the four subtypes of HSP previously described by Professor Crosby’s team, >95% of Amish HSP cases now have a genetic diagnosis. Our genetic, biochemical and clinical studies of this group of disorders have identified a new paradigm that defines ‘lipidomic imbalance’ as a key and common pathomolecular cause of motor neurone degenerative diseases, identifying potential new biomarkers of disease and therapeutic targets **\[3.4\]**. The genes associated with these newly described disorders had never been associated with human disease before. 

 **2.2 Advancing knowledge of Amish genomic architecture**. 

 Prior to 2013, knowledge of genetic disease occurring amongst the OWI\-Amish was extremely limited, with the precise genetic cause recognised in only about 15% of patients. Exeter genomic studies have defined the specific nature and spectrum of genetic disease in the Amish. More than 150 genetic mutations were identified in established disease genes, for diseases not previously recognised in the community. These Amish genome studies have also enabled the clinical relevance of genomic variation to be determined, due to the serendipitous enrichment within the community of variants that are rare globally. Each Amish individual carries at least six disease causing gene mutations, present within relatively few genes compared with families worldwide. Together, this work has defined the specific genetic basis of the immense burden of OWI\-Amish inherited disease. This has resulted in improved scientific and clinical understanding of genetic and epigenetic variation **\[3.5\]**, including refuting previously accepted disease gene/variant associations and preventing misdiagnoses **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **4.1 New diagnostic testing approaches have been designed, developed and implemented in regional laboratories serving Amish communities**. 

 The Exeter team developed targeted tests for the 20 commonest genetic causes of disease among the Amish and shared methodologies with three regional certified diagnostic laboratories. In collaboration with PlexSeq Diagnostics \(Cleveland\), the team developed a new comprehensive, rapid, multiplexed, low\-cost approach to diagnostic testing, based on blood\-spot\-derived DNA. This technology now provides an expandable custom panel assay that tests 178 OWI\-Amish gene mutations in parallel. This ‘Amish panel test’ is embedded in the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, for newborn screening, diagnostic and carrier testing **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. 

 **4.2 Establishment of regional specialist healthcare clinics for genetic disease.** 

 Prior to 2013, there were no specialist clinics providing healthcare for inherited diseases in OWI\-Amish communities. The Exeter\-led Amish research programme Windows of Hope **\[5.3\]** worked alongside clinician\-led community initiatives to develop specialist clinics in Ohio \(New Leaf Center’s Clinic for Special Children, opened 2014\) **\[5.2, 5.4\]** and Wisconsin \(Center for Special Children at La Farge Medical Clinic, opened 2015\) **\[5.2, 5.5\]**. These clinics serve a combined Amish population of >100,000, although many patients also travel from out of state to access this specialised care. As a consequence of Exeter\-led research, local clinicians are now able to recognise a patient’s disorder and order a cost\-effective \(\~$50\) genetic test, enabling diagnoses for \~50% of families **\[5.2, 5.4, 5.5\]**. Dr Baple and Professor Crosby support regular clinics for patients at both sites, translating research discoveries directly into clinical care and have improved the diagnostic rates from <15% \(2013\) to \~70% \(2020\). Early precise diagnosis combined with improved clinical understanding has led to more effective treatment and screening for disease complications **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.3 Reductions in healthcare costs**. 

 Many Amish live below the federal poverty threshold and have no health insurance. The standard clinical evaluation to diagnose a child with neurodevelopmental disability costs an average of US$19,000 \(ranging from $9,000 to $35,000\), excluding professional fees, indirect institutional expenses and genome sequencing **.** The cost of the new systematic diagnostic genetic testing pathway designed by the Exeter team for Amish children affected by developmental disorders, ranges from $300 \(clinic visit plus targeted genetic test\) to $2250 \(including targeted test, Amish panel test, genome sequencing, and clinic visit\). This testing pathway has saved at least $16,750 per diagnosis for the 950 OWI\-Amish patients who have been diagnosed, totalling at least $15 million since 2013 **\[**costs provided by Amish specialist clinics and referenced in **5.2** and **5.6\]**. Since 2013, 72 patients were diagnosed with disorders affecting neurological and cognitive function in whom early genetic diagnosis and treatment has prevented or reduced neurodisability, unnecessary hospitalisation and investigations. Examples include diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of hypoglycaemia and seizures in KPTN\-related disorder, and prevention of metabolic stroke in the Amish variant of propionic acidaemia, which is not reliably detected through metabolic newborn screening. The lifetime cost savings for these patients are estimated to be more than $90 million **\[**costs from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004 and Amish specialist clinics, 2020 referenced in **5.2** and **5.6\]**. 

 **4.4 Education initiatives for the public, healthcare professionals, and the Amish community**. 

 Four MRC Medical Research Foundation grants **\[5.7\]** funded educational and community initiatives developed and delivered by the Exeter research team between 2014\-2019. Few requests for genetic tests for diseases prevalent within the OWI\-Amish were received from family doctors, local or specialist clinicians prior to 2014. More than 300 requests were made between 2018\-2020 by clinical providers in Wisconsin following the education initiatives \[ **5.2**\]: 

 \(i\) The Exeter Windows of Hope Website includes a database of all known Amish/Mennonite inherited disorders and describes a systematic approach to defining differential diagnoses, accessing diagnostic testing and tailoring treatment **\[5.3\]**. 

 \(ii\) Continuing Medical Education \(CME\) accredited symposia for health, education and social care professionals were developed and delivered by the Exeter research team, alongside local and subspecialty clinical experts, each attended by >50 specialists. Over 96% of attendees reported improved knowledge and understanding of Amish genetic disease. Feedback included: “ *I have learnt the importance of early diagnosis to provide the best medical care and outcome* *and* *avoid unnecessary costly hospital stays”* **\[5.2, 5.3, 5.5\]**. 

 \(iii\) Family meetings and disease\-specific literature. Over 1000 Amish have attended >14 disease\-specific events \(2013\-2020\). Information brochures for 30 disorders have been developed, with 1000s printed and used by the specialist clinics, family practices and special education schools serving the Amish **\[, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8\]**. 

 \(iv\) A Massive Open Online Course, “Genomic Medicine and Research: A Community Approach”. The first course \(2019\) attracted 386 medical, academic, social science and legal participants, along with patients and families affected by genetic disease. The Medical Director of the New Leaf Clinic tells course attendees: “ *I can quickly focus the tests I order when seeing a child with an unknown cause of developmental delay because of the work that’s done through the research in Exeter. It is the best example of translational work that I have seen in 15 years of practic*e.” <sup> **</sup>\[5.2, 5.8\]** 

 Together, these initiatives have inspired local clinics and the Amish community to develop disease registries so that new research findings are now quickly shared. Numerous media outlets have reported how the educational programme has not only improved Amish healthcare outcomes, but also reduced stigma and misunderstanding and changed attitudes towards rare genetic disease and genetic testing among the Amish, healthcare providers and the public **\[5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9\]**. 

 **4.5 Genetic discoveries in the Amish have been translated into diagnostic and clinical benefits worldwide.** 

 Almost all the novel disorders described by the Exeter group have subsequently also been identified outside the Amish population. The research team have produced accessible information for families about the diseases they have defined in response to requests from support groups, including the National Organization for Rare Disorders \(NORD\), an international patient advocacy organisation **\[5.10\]**. Prof Crosby and Dr Baple are scientific and clinical advisors to the KPTN Alliance Family Support Group and also developed the Troyer syndrome clinical guidelines, adopted by clinicians worldwide and accessed through US National Center for Biotechnology Information **\[5.10\]**.

#  1. **Summary of the impact** 

 Deaths due to drug misuse are an increasingly common cause of premature mortality. University of Manchester \(UoM\) researchers carried out the largest studies of drug\-related mortality ever conducted internationally, based on a national cohort of persons treated for drug misuse and with criminal justice system involvement. We highlighted the protective effect of opioid substitution treatment. Our findings have enhanced understanding of the drivers of drug\-related mortality for practitioners, policymakers, governments and the public, and guided clinical responses and national policies. We have stimulated debate on the key role of opioid substitution treatment in reducing fatal overdose, contributing to national policy and to changes in practice, affirming the importance of harm reduction to reduce risk.

#  2. **Underpinning research** 

##  Context 

 Fatal overdose involving illicit drugs is a major public health problem and there has been an alarming increase in the frequency of these tragic events in England and Wales, where approximately 80% involve opioids. North America is experiencing a fatal opioid overdose ‘epidemic’. 

 The UK’s sharp rise in fatal overdose rates coincided with a radical shift in the emphasis of government policy. Previously, opioid misuse treatment focussed on harm reduction, with opioid substitution treatment \(OST\) the mainstay of care. From 2010 this emphasis shifted: the newly elected Government’s drug strategy ‘Reducing Demand, Restricting Supply, Building Recovery: Supporting People to Live a Drug Free Life’ stated: “ *… instead of focusing primarily on reducing the harms … \[our approach will support\] … recovery as an achievable way out of dependency.*” 

 Coinciding with substantial funding cuts and new performance indicators based on the number of patients discharged \(abstinent\) from treatment, this shift shaped an environment that encouraged patients to cease OST / reduce their dose to pursue abstinent recovery. Ministers went so far as to propose arbitrarily time\-limiting the permissible duration of OST. In the USA, OST has long been hard to access and of variable quality, driven by: a\) views of addiction as a ‘moral failing’; b\) an established treatment ideology that favours non\-prescribing alternatives. Thus, *“there is substantial evidence that \[substitution treatment\] \- which has faced ideological resistance on and off for decades \- reduce the mortality rate among people addicted to opioids by half”* \(New York Times, 29/12/2018 \- citing \[2\]\); “ *… use of...* \[OST medications\] *… remains surrounded by misconceptions and prejudices that have hindered their delivery*“ \(Office of the Surgeon General, 2018\). Recent work suggests that only 10% of patients in the USA can access OST \(Wakeman et al, 2020\). Federal regulations in particular have been an obstacle to accessing OST. 

##  Key research findings relevant to the impact 

 Understanding of opioid\-related mortality has been hampered by underpowered research. Our research team addressed this deficiency by assembling the largest illicit opioid user cohort internationally to date \(entire treatment population and all users known to the criminal justice system in England\), linked to Office for National Statistics mortality registrations \(n=198,247; 541,891 person\-years of observation; n=3,974 deaths\). Our investigation was: 

-  the largest study of treatment and fatal overdose ever undertaken, with abundant statistical power 

-  the first to investigate age\-related increase in fatal overdose risk beyond age 45 \( *highly pertinent as the ‘Trainspotting’ generation of heroin users enters middle age*\) 

-  the first to calculate age\-specific trends in excess mortality risk 

 We demonstrated that fatal overdose risk: 

-  doubles with increasing age \(risk at age 45\-64 >2 times that at 18\-24 years\) \[1\], \[2\] 

-  is halved during OST, compared to non\-treatment periods \[2\] 

-  is not reduced during non\-OST treatments \[2\] 

-  quadruples at discharge from OST, even for ostensibly ‘abstinent’ patients \[2\] 

 We also found that: disease, suicide or homicide account for >50% of premature mortality \(death <65 years\) in opioid users \[1\]; prescribing of methadone \(vs. buprenorphine\) may be contraindicated in older patients \[3\]; treatment risk mitigation was most pronounced for those with the greatest behavioural/demographic risk, \[2\] but weaker for criminal justice\-involved patients \[2\], \[4\]; until 2010, treatment had saved up to 1,000 lives per annum in England \[5\]. 

 In policy terms, the key implications of the underpinning research are: 

-  Ageing of the UK’s heroin users is a substantial contributor to increasing fatal overdose incidence. Most of these people started using heroin in the 1980s /early 1990s as young adults; they are now entering middle age, prematurely frail, and with deteriorating health. Without intervention to reduce their risk, rates of fatal overdose will continue to increase. 

-  The shift away from harm reduction/OST and the emphasis on discharging patients will have placed opioid users at much greater risk, exacerbating their already increasing age\-related risk. Without renewed investment in prioritising harm reduction through OST, fatal overdose rates will increase to an even higher level. 

-  Poor accessibility of OST, hitherto available to only a very small minority of patients, exacerbates the USA’s fatal overdose ‘epidemic’. Improved accessibility, requiring a change in policymakers’ and the public’s views of OST, as well as regulatory change, would lead to a marked risk reduction nationally.

#  4. **Details of the impact** 

##  Context 

 Because drug misuse is a highly politicised policy area, government strategies tend to be ideologically driven. Therefore, generating impact requires a complex process of stimulating debate to nudge the direction of policy, whilst driving optimal clinical practice through evidence\-based guidelines and recommendations. In the UK, this process operates via agencies such as Public Health England \(supporting local treatment commissioning\), the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs \(the Government’s statutory, independent advisory body\) and clinical and practitioner guidelines. 

##  Pathways to Impact 

 Our research group brought its findings to the attention of key stakeholders, including policymakers and providers of clinical services. Millar \(PI\) was invited to join the national expert groups considering drug\-related mortality: 

-  Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs: working group on opioid related deaths \(2016\) 

-  Public Health England: Drug\-related Deaths Inquiry \(2016\) 

-  Collective Voice / NHS National Substance Misuse Provider Alliance: expert group on drug\-related mortality representing all treatment providers in England \(2017\) 

 By invitation, we presented evidence to: 

-  House of Commons Health and Social Care Select Committee Review of Drug Policy \(2019\) \(parliamentary committee overseeing the Department of Health and Social Care\) 

-  NHS Substance Misuse Provider Alliance Drug\-related Deaths Conference \(2017\) 

-  Scottish Government / Partnership for Action on Drugs in Scotland Expert Meeting on Drug Deaths \(2017\) 

-  Three sessions of the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction \(EMCDDA, the European illicit drugs agency\) Expert Meeting on Drug\-related Deaths \(2013, 2017, 2017\). Additionally, EMCDDA commissioned Millar to undertake an assessment of drug\-related deaths in Europe \(2016\). 

 Our group also influenced wider public debate and advocacy in the USA. Millar worked with a UK drug policy charity \(DrugScope\) that published a lay, social media summary of our findings \(blog received four times as many views, n=1,700, in a fortnight than the annual average\). Social media exposure attracted attention from US\-based advocates and media outlets lobbying for more accessible OST provision in the USA \(where health systems hamper research of this type\). They broadcasted findings regarding OST’s protective effect within their work to shift public opinion and Federal Government policy. Impact in this public arena is clearly evident from the work’s Altmetric score of 943 \(measures attention, influence and impact\) of 22 May 2020, which ranks \[2\] in the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile for journal outputs of similar age / ever tracked. Altmetric lists: cites in 217 news stories from 99 outlets, including prominent coverage in the UK \( *Guardian*\) and US \( *New York Times* and *Washington Post*\) national media; 175 tweets from 118 users, \(reaching an upper bound of 404,260 followers\), 34% from the USA and additionally the UK, Canada, Australia, Spain, Ireland, New Zealand, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and Indonesia; 65% of all tweets by members of the public \(indicative of impact on public opinion\); 11 posts from 8 blogs. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

 The research identified specific groups within this clinical population that are at elevated risk. This improved awareness of the underlying demographic driver of increasing fatal overdoses in the UK, whilst enabling treatment services to identify patients at highest risk. Most importantly, it reaffirmed the importance of OST as a harm reduction intervention that will attenuate increasing fatal overdose rates, as reflected in advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and from the House of Commons Health and Social Care Select Committee, and also in legislative changes in the USA designed to enhance OST’s availability. 

 **a. Impact on guidance and recommendations:** There is abundant evidence of our group’s impact in informing policy recommendations and clinical guidance. Between first publication \(in 2015\) and 2019, key findings were reported in: 

-  House of Commons Drug Policy Parliamentary Debate, 2017 \[A\] 

-  House of Commons Health and Social Care Committee Report on Drug Policy, 2019 \[B\] 

-  UK Clinical Guidelines \[C\] 

-  Clinical guidance \(to all treatment providers\) on reducing overdose \[D\] 

-  Four reports, including \[E, F, G\], from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs 

-  Two reports by Public Health England, including \[H\] 

-  Scottish Government investigation of drug\-related death among women 

-  EMCDDA assessment of drug deaths \[I\] 

-  Canadian Clinical Practice Guidance \[J\] 

 **b. Impact on practice:** Our research has had a direct influence on UK clinical practice. The UK’s largest treatment provider \(with approximately 35,000 opioid\-dependent patients\), with our input, developed risk assessment processes \[K\] used to assess all service users and that are informed directly by \[1\] and \[2\]. Additionally, national best practice guidelines on risk assessment \(\[D\], page 6\), formulated by representatives of all treatment providers in England, cite the risk factors identified by the group, recommending that these should “ *…. inform the risk management plan for an individual …*”. During 2018/19 these providers treated 139,845 of the \(approximately\) 260,000 people in England who use illicit opioids. During the Covid\-19 emergency, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs \(ACMD\) cited our work when approving changes to the controlled drugs prescribing regulations, noting that it provides “ *high quality evidence*” that opioid users are “ *at an already significantly elevated risk of mortality from the underlying health conditions that commonly cause complications in those who contract Covid\-19*” \(ACMD advice on proposed legislative changes to enable supply of controlled drugs during a pandemic: letter to the Home Secretary, 7 April 2020, pages 10 and 12\). The Council advised that altering the regulations to permit less frequent attendance at pharmacies would help opioid users to maintain social distancing, benefitting up to 140,000 patients in England and approximately 30,000 in Scotland and Wales. In addition, the EMCDDA recommended that EU member states should “ *investigate the scope of assessing rates of drug\-related death among known cohorts of problem opioid users”* \[I\], based on our group’s methodology. 

 **c. Impact on policy:** Our research has influenced a shift in policy as regards harm reduction. As stated above, because drug misuse is a highly politicised policy arena, shifts in the direction of policy seldom occur in response to \(or are attributed to\) findings from a single study. However, our group’s work has made a significant contribution \(evident from the number and range of citations \[A\-J\]\) to a body of evidence that has shifted the policy discourse to recognise the pressing need to again embrace harm reduction. As a result: 

-  Public / policy awareness of OST’s key role in reducing fatal overdose rates has been enhanced \(proposals to time\-limit OST were dropped\). 

-  In the UK, both the House of Commons Health and Social Care Select Committee \[B\] and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs \[F\] \(both cited our group’s work\) recommended renewed investment in drug treatment / OST and a renewed focus on harm reduction to attenuate fatal overdose risk among the approximately 340,000 illicit opioid users in England, Scotland and Wales. 

-  In the USA, the Federal Government yielded to pressure from the media and advocacy groups and passed legislation \(Support for Patients and Communities Act, 2018\) designed to address the opioid overdose epidemic. This lifted restrictions on prescribing OST in addiction treatment to the benefit of the approximately 2,000,000 individuals in the USA who have been diagnosed with an opioid misuse disorder.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Research that has investigated the significance of mindfulness\-based interventions \(MBIs\) on wellbeing\-related indicators has provided significant impact in the domains of contributing to public ‘ **understanding and learning**’, supporting ‘ **practitioners and practice**’, and enhancing ‘ **health and well\-being**’. This is reflected in extensive discussion and citation in the professional, practitioner and popular media, external partnership with professional organisations and delivery agencies, and improved wellbeing outcomes within trials. Several intervention trials, longitudinal studies, and a large cohort study were conducted demonstrating the positive impact of MBIs on wellbeing, resiliency, workaholism, fibromyalgia, work\-related stress, and psycho\-spiritual wellbeing. 

  
","
1.  **Underpinning research** – References in section 3 are indicated by number \(e.g., **R1**\) 

 Dunn’s research has contributed important insight into the field of mindfulness\-based interventions on wellbeing by demonstrating that: 

-  Mindfulness\-based therapies are effective at increasing wellbeing across a range of disorders; 

-  Non\-attachment \(the ability to ‘suspend attempts to control experience’\) is a core component in how meditation may impact wellbeing; and 

-  A greater range of meditative techniques can impact psycho\-spiritual wellbeing \( **R1, R2**\). 

 Second\-generation mindfulness\-based interventions \(SG\-MBIs\) have been employed, such as Mindfulness Awareness Training \(MAT\), reflecting a new direction in mindfulness research and practice \( **R1, R2, R3, R4**\). Differing from the emphasis placed on attentional processes found in mindfulness\-based stress reduction and mindfulness\-based cognitive therapy, SG\-MBIs emphasise the Buddhist principle of non\-attachment, which is based on the view that suffering arises as a result of an individual’s ‘attachment’ to both themselves and external phenomena \(e.g., wealth, people, and reputation\). The typical MAT schedule employed by Dunn requires participants to attend weekly workshops \(e.g., taught/presentation, group\-discussion, meditation\) and receive a CD of guided meditations to facilitate daily self\-practice. Applied to several psychological and psychosomatic disorders, MAT has demonstrated beneficial impact, including fibromyalgia syndrome \(FMS\), work\-related stress, workaholism, and resiliency. 

 Given that self\-attachment is deemed to play a role in the maintenance of FMS, interventions that specifically aim to reduce attachment \(to self, symptoms, and environment\) warrant empirical investigation \(i.e., MAT\) – something addressed in the research. Specifically, a randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) was conducted \( **R4**\), examining the impact of MAT on multiple FMS symptom\-related outcomes \(e.g., FMS symptomatology, pain perception, sleep quality, psychological distress, civic engagement, and non\-attachment to self, symptoms, and environment\). 

 Workaholism has been empirically demonstrated to be a distinct construct compared with enthusiastic working and work engagement. Despite the relatively high instances of workaholism, there is a concern that prevalence rates could increase even further with the proliferation of technology\-driven modern working styles \(e.g., use of laptops, tablets, and smartphones\) that blur the work–leisure boundary. A controlled trial \(CT\), was conducted, testing the effect of MAT on work addiction, job satisfaction, work duration and work involvement, depression, anxiety and stress \( **R3**\). 

 Mindfulness has recently shown promise in mental illness treatment and preventative contexts with school\-aged young people. However, there is a shortage of studies investigating the effects of school\-based mindfulness interventions on young people of a pre\-adolescent and early\-adolescent age. Thus, Dunn’s research has aimed to bridge the intersection between wellbeing and education, with particular reference to the Department of Education’s drive to ensure adequate *Mental Health and Wellbeing Provision in Schools.* As such, an investigation has explored the effects of a regional multi\-site school\-based mindfulness programme on wellbeing and resiliency in a large cohort of school children aged 9\-13 years old.

 **4. Details of the impact** – Sources in section 5 are indicated by number \(e.g., S1\) 

 Impact types related to: 

-  ‘Understanding, learning and participation’; 

-  ‘Practitioners and professional services’; 

-  ‘Health and wellbeing’. 

 Principal modes of impact were: 

-  Discussion and citation in the professional, practitioner and popular media; 

-  Development of practice with external professional partners; 

-  Improved wellbeing outcomes within trials. 

 The main beneficiaries were: 

-  Media readerships and audiences; 

-  Schools; 

-  External professional partners; 

-  Trial participants. 

 **Media and public engagement** 

 Impact on promoting understanding, learning and participation can be evidenced through extensive media coverage. Discussion and citation of Dunn’s work on the health benefits associated with MBIs has enhanced cultural understanding, stimulated interest and engagement in the research, and informed public attitudes and abilities to make decisions. 

  

 Media engagement has been across a total of 34 publishing and broadcasting forms. This includes various professional/practitioner \( **S1**\), and popular \( **S2**\) media, including: *Metro* \(1.3 million average circulation\), *IFL Science* \(25m unique visitors per month; Facebook 625m people\), *PsyPost* \(1.4 million readers per month\), *Medical Express*, *US News*, and *Bangkok Post*. 

 A series of the engagements related specifically to a project in Derbyshire \(see below\), including:  *Derbyshire Times* and *BBC Radio Derby*. Additionally, as part of a wider ‘Wellbeing in Schools project’, Dunn also produced Vlog material on the benefit of meditation. This was distributed to over 264 schools in the UK \(with a student population of over 63,000 pupils\) enhancing ‘public understanding and learning’. 

 **Professional partnership** 

 Impact was reflected in a project comprising partnership with professional agencies engaged in the development and delivery of services. This aimed to connect wellbeing and education, with reference to the DfE \(2018\) *Mental Health and Wellbeing Provision in Schools.* 

 Working with stakeholders \(Derbyshire Education Services and Derbyshire County Council\) and end users \(school\-aged pupils\), Dunn engaged with 20 schools and 1138 pupils, piloting a mindfulness programme designed to enhance resiliency and wellbeing and reduce vulnerability in children aged between 9\-12 years. The project utilised a specific 9\-week school\-based MBI called Mindfulness Attention Programme \(MAP\), where weekly sessions aimed to support children’s wellbeing by focusing on how to cope with stress. In addition to the weekly sessions, students took part in daily mindful practice for two minutes following playtime and lunchtime. Results showed a significant decrease in Vulnerability Index and significant increase in Resource Index, between pre\- and post\-MAP participation. Overall, MAP provided a positive impact across multiple educational sites in terms of increasing personal strength and reducing the disparity between personal resources and emotional reactivity \(i.e., vulnerability\) \- constructs thought to be at the core of developing resiliency. 

 **Trial outcomes** 

 Impact is evidenced through improved trial outcomes for several patient groups including sufferers of fibromyalgia, work\-related stress, and workaholism. All intervention studies included at least a three\-month follow up which provided a measure of MBIs long\-term impact on wellbeing markers. 

  

 There is growing interest into the applications of MBIs for treating fibromyalgia syndrome \(FMS\), where designing interventions continues to be a challenge. FMS is associated with high rates of presenting at medical services, yet there is no reliable laboratory test for FMS. Additionally, while some patients appear to respond favourably to pharmacological treatments, many experience limited symptom reduction as well as adverse pharmacotherapy effects. The MAT intervention has resulted in significant reductions in FMS symptomatology for 74 adults with a current diagnosis of FMS, compared to an active control group. The impact of the MBI intervention for patients suffering with FMS was moderate to high. This effect was empirically shown to increase when assessed at six\-month post intervention, demonstrating a measurable and lasting impact of MAT on improving functioning for 74 individuals diagnosed with FMS. 

 Work\-related stress \(WRS\) accounts for 55% of all work\-related illness \(Health and Safety Executive, 2020\) and 17.9 million working days were lost in Great Britain due to WRS in 2019\-2020 \(Health and Safety Executive, 2020\), which in conjunction with other work\-related mental health issues, costs the British economy up to £34.9 billion per year \(Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2017\). Thus, Dunn’s work is particularly significant as it shows meditation to concurrently improve work\-related wellbeing, job performance \(across five job roles\) and positively reduce work involvement for individuals who work excessively. The research shows a reduction in WRS indicators for 76 male and female full\-time office\-based employees with middle management responsibility. The magnitude of this reduction was estimated to be high. Building on this, the impact was gauged of MAT interventions on workaholism for 37 male and female adults in full\-time employment. Investigation showed a large reduction in behaviours associated with work addiction for the MAT intervention compared to controls.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The UK social care market \(which has grown from £2bn in 2012 to £6bn in 2020\) is fragmented into Assistive Technology \(AT\) ‘niches’ supplied by specialist businesses who only have limited access to R&D investment and lack the ability to optimise their designs for their product users. Mainstream NPD \(new product development\) also needs to account for the needs of the widest population to ensure social inclusivity. Our research addressed this by developing a novel design process \(‘LUCAT’\), which delivered two key impacts: \(1\) Enabled niche designers of AT \(e.g. Nottingham Rehab Supplies Ltd\) and mainstream companies \(e.g. Philips, Arup\) to use a cost\-effective way to elicit user requirements and deliver optimal design solutions, and \(2\) improved the ability of people with disabilities, and the charities that represent them, to engage with previously inaccessible sports, such as Boccia and independent running. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research led by Dr Torrens, ongoing for the last ten years, aimed to improve the lives of people living with disabilities through developing a process to support new product developers of AT in designing products that truly meet the needs and wants of users in a cost\-effective way. Our research approach to developing this design process used novel participatory research design methods and heuristics, underpinned with theory and principles from social psychology and systems engineering. The resulting design process was called LUCAT \(The Loughborough User\-Centred Assistive Technology process\) **\[R1\]**. 

 The LUCAT process is a streamlined collection of design, engineering, ergonomics and human factors theory and best practice in User\-Centred Design \(UCD\) brought together to enable time\-compressed market research and evidence\-based design decision\-making. The process concept was based on Torrens’ experience of working in the field of AT product design since 1986. He then refined the process and through further research studies between 2010\-2020, has significantly expanded the methods and heuristics into the current LUCAT process with the support of Fray **\[R3, R4, R5, R6\]**. 

 LUCAT was developed through a practice\-based, bottom\-up participatory approach within AT product design, informed by Ergonomics and Human Factors theory. The research programme that underpinned the LUCAT process initially defined a suitable approach **\[R1, R2\]**. This was based on the conventions of design innovation, the fast time\-compressed and iterative cycle of participatory design, and best practice from small batch production design engineering. 

 These initial methods and heuristics were augmented by additional research into best practice relating to optimum formats of communication to be used by new product developers **\[R3\],** principles from social sciences and psychology **\[R4\]**, and applied within a mixed methods research approach **\[R2\]**. 

 Some of the novel principles and heuristics added to the LUCAT process included ‘social camouflage’ \(using principles from military camouflage to disguise unusual shapes and profiles within AT products that would be seen as ‘different’\); ‘blacksmith’s approach’ \(a one\-to\-one dialogue between designer\-maker and user that would have been commonplace in pre\-industrial design\); and, ‘technology footprint’, \(the visual area within the profile of a person with a disability taken up by equipment that affects the viewer’s perception of that person’s persona\). In addition, principles used in other disciplines but not conventionally within design development were also employed, such as ‘cultural blindness’, \(the differences in how people from different cultures perceive images – important for online sales of AT products\) **\[R1, R4\]**. 

 The potential for a wider application of the LUCAT process was shown through the review of case studies from other researchers **\[R1, R2\]**. The review highlighted the limited number of methods which designers use within new product development, \(conventionally four: literature review, task analysis/ usability evaluation, interview, and observation\), and the opportunity to apply the LUCAT process whose elements have been sourced from over 200 research and design methods in appropriate communication formats for this market **\[R2, R3, R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The **pathways** to impact for the LUCAT design process have involved collaborative activity instigated many years before its development. For 25 years, Torrens has regularly invited local and national representatives of charities \(e.g., Age UK, University of the Third Age, Motor Neurone Disease Association, Arthritis Care, REMAP GB, Vista Blind\) to collaborate on network events and student projects, linking their membership directly to student designers and the underpinning research being done by the research team **\[R4, R5, R6\]**. This collaboration provided a deep understanding of the assistive technology design needs of industry and charities. LUCAT is made accessible to practitioners via the Usability\-NET website \( [https://usability\-net.lboro.ac.uk/](https://usability-net.lboro.ac.uk/)\). This resource developed by Torrens contains a cohesive collection of inspirational and best\-practice research case studies to support those applying user\-centred design approaches to cost\-effectively design products to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The free resource, used by both practitioners and students, aligns the methods and heuristics with the relevant standards for the New Product Development \(NPD\) of AT. The LUCAT process has been presented at industry exhibitions and conferences such as NAIDEX and recognised through Industry Awards. It was a finalist in the 2019 Leicestershire LIVE awards for education, and a Graduate Inclusive sports product developer \(a recipient of LUCAT training\) won the Young Innovator Award at the same event **\[S5\]**, demonstrating knowledge transfer from education into industrial design practice. Over 500 graduates and postgraduates have been trained in the LUCAT process, many of whom now hold senior positions in consultancies or global brands such as Samsung and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Senior Usability Designer, Philips Experience Design, has provided evidence of how training in the LUCAT process has impacted on his professional practice **\[S1\]**. Together, the research and its pathways have led to the following impacts. 

 **Impact 1: Enabled designers of AT to use a cost\-effective way to elicit user requirements and deliver optimal design solutions.** 

 Our research on the underpinning design methods, applied using heuristics and an approach communicated through best practice and exemplars **\[R1, R2, R3\]** delivered a better way of doing new product development to designers and businesses within the AT product market. The LUCAT process addressed the need of inventors, start\-ups and small businesses to have an effective way of cost\-effectively gaining insights from the AT market. This is highlighted through the examples of a student enterprise project, Tap Dash, an inclusive point\-to\-point running game, and AT equipment development for Visually Impaired \(VI\) Boccia. The Inventor of the VI Boccia game had attended an event to bring student designers and people with a need for AT products together, organised by Torrens. 

 For example, the production of **Kura Care cutlery** demonstrates the effectiveness of the LUCAT process in practice \(Figure 1\). The cutlery was designed for **Nottingham Rehab Supplies Limited** **\(NRS**\). NRS had given invited lectures to our students and were aware of the work of Torrens before commissioning commercial design work. It was produced using the LUCAT process for a small budget and in less than three months from request to production. It followed an earlier research study of cutlery for NRS and applied Gestalt principles of perception \(associated with foreground background and applied through military camouflage\) to deliver ‘social camouflage’ for the unusually shaped products to appear more conventional, reducing stigma and associated product abandonment. **\[R1, R2, R6\]**

 The LUCAT process provided New Product Development \(NPD\) teams with a clear stage\-by\-stage process for rapid research and design methods including co\-design, reducing the time and cost risks within NPD. The Head of New Product Development at **Nottingham Rehab Supplies Ltd \(NRS\)**, a major manufacturer and supplier of assistive technology products internationally, and regional representative of the British Healthcare Trades Association, stated: 

 *“The Kura Care cutlery range is one of our best\-selling cutlery ranges. We sell approximately 30,000 sets and items per year, with increased sales year on year.”* **\[S2\]** 

 Furthermore, as evidence of the LUCAT process delivering cost\-effective solutions, The Senior Design Engineer at NRS, reported: 

 *“The training I had in the LUCAT process enabled me to get my current and previous job. I have introduced elements of the LUCAT process to engineers and healthcare professionals in my teams in each new role to more effectively gain insights from end users and stakeholders and deliver commercially viable products.”* **\[S3\]** 

 Other beneficiaries of the LUCAT process **\[R1\]** report its impact, including the cost\-effectiveness and suitability of the process for gaining user and stakeholder needs, ensuring appropriateness for the market. The Senior Usability Designer at **Philips Experience Design** stated: 

 *“A user\-centred approach to design is a core aspect of any project I lead. I have introduced much of the LUCAT process as described into our new product development process and to the multi\-disciplinary team, which has enhanced our ability to gain consumer insights.”  \[S1\]** 

 Similarly, a Human Factors Consultant at **SYSTRA** **Scott Lister**, reflected on how he had raised awareness of the process within his multi\-disciplinary team during stakeholder consultations, whilst on placement with **Arup Group Ltd**, a major civil engineering company: 

 *“...I knew within the first week of the brief that the elements of the LUCAT process were applicable to the project. ...not having an early codesign intervention, especially for an infrastructure project, would be detrimental… due to the success of using the insights, the organisation was considering adopting the approach for future work.”* **\[S4\]** 

 He was referring to the need to gain insights and an affinity from individuals and stakeholder groups, representing people with a wide range of disabilities, at the design stage who would use the transport system to avoid major additional costs due to alterations at the construction stage. 

 **Impact 2: Improved the ability of people with disabilities, and the charities who represent them, to engage in sports.** 

 The underpinning research **\[R1, R5, R6\]** was used by Torrens and Fray to gain a better understanding of the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, and the charities that represent them, engaging them in participatory codesign to produce outcomes with a sense of ownership. **\[S6, S7\]** The application internationally of the LUCAT process, is presented in the following examples. These show the reach and impact the approach has had on individuals, communities, organisations, and its usefulness in empowering individuals in different cultures and social groups to have the confidence to change their lives. The examples shown are \(i\) the **Tactile Boccia Grid** and \(ii\) **Visually Impaired Running Line**. 

 \(i\) Boccia is a Paralympic inclusive sport like French Boules. The LUCAT process was used with the Inventor and Visually Impaired \(VI\) Boccia players to develop the Tactile Boccia Grid, which enabled players to progress rapidly to an advanced level of tactical play and become competitive against sighted players. \(See Figure 3 below\). Since 2014, from a few local teams in the East Midlands, the game has expanded to two National competitions and is regularly played in over 30 centres around the country. Over 150 units have been used in 14 countries. **\[S3\]** The Director of **Handi Life Sport**, Denmark, the main worldwide distributor of Boccia equipment and products, including the Tactile Boccia Grid, stated: 

 *“...the device serves a great purpose of inclusion of the visually impaired players with the sighted players.”* **\[S6\]** 

 Furthermore, the Principal of the **Sense \(Formerly RNIB\) College** commented on the engagement between College students and University staff and design students on design projects, including the Tactile Boccia grid: 

 “*what's important for them is to be able to be with young people of a similar age to themselves and … exposed … to people outside of their usual frame … to mix with people outside this sphere of knowledge … that's a really important thing … to feel that their contributing to something really important.”* **\[S7\]** 

 \(ii\) The participatory approach and codesign stages from the LUCAT process were embedded in the research **\[R6\]** to produce the **Visually Impaired \(VI\) Running Line**. This enabled visually impaired and blind people to run independently of a guide runner giving them a sense of control and independence not previously experienced in their life \(see Figure 2 right\) **\[S8\]**. This VI Running Line enabled engagement with many adapted sports groups to deliver a wide range of innovative events, activities and interventions. 

 Many VI or blind people have never run more than a few steps in their lives, nor competed against other runners. During the sessions the VI Running Line enabled them to race against their VI, blind and sighted peers. The VI Running Line has been demonstrated at nearly 300 events across the UK and used by over 1,600 Blind and Visually Impaired children and adults, most of whom would have never experienced running independently. When parents and carers have also used the running line, it gave them a better understanding of the difficulties faced by those in their care. The Co\-Inventor of the VI Running Line and Inclusive Sports Coach, stated: 

 *“The experience gave parents an insight into the level of uncertainty and difficulty their children had in everyday living, moving and travel in their world and opening discussion between them.”* **\[S9\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Previous perceptions of Wales as ‘unknown’ and ‘invisible’ in European travel writing were transformed by Swansea research which uncovered continental Europeans’ views of Wales since 1750. Sharing these findings with new regional, national and international audiences in education, heritage, creative practice and cultural policy led to numerous benefits. These included changes in pedagogical practices, enhanced understandings of European perspectives and refugee artists’ representations of Wales, and the creation of new, multilingual literary works on Wales. Jones collaborated with stakeholders to develop digital heritage research tools, educational resources, and creative writing that informed national policy initiatives valuing ethically informed citizenship and cultural diversity.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **European Travellers to Wales: 1750\-2010* \[ETW\] is a **collaborative research project** by Bangor University \(PI Prof Carol Tully\), Swansea University \(CoI Dr Kathryn Jones\) and the Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies \(CoI Dr Heather Williams\). The major AHRC project \(£420,000\) investigates the representation of Wales and ‘Welshness’ in texts by European travellers from 1750 to the present day \[R1, R3, R4\], deploying Jones’s expertise in Breton, French and German culture and history from the late 19th to the 21st century. 

 Working in archives across Europe, the team **unearthed a rich corpus** of over 500 previously undiscovered accounts of travel to Wales written in 15 languages, and a further 450 guidebooks in French, German and Dutch \[R5\]. A **digital database** \[R2\] maps each journey and users can search for traits including periods, destinations, nationalities, and reasons for travel. This **original contribution to** **Wales Studies** makes international perceptions of Wales newly available in select translations. This study of a smaller nation hitherto minoritised within travel writing studies is paradigmatic for investigating the evolving perceptions of less historically ‘visible’ nations, e.g. Brittany, Catalonia. *The Times Higher Education* \[23/02/2017\] commended the **innovative approach** of using the prism of **Modern Languages\-based research** in the field of **Celtic Studies**, ‘demonstrating how modern languages increasingly help us to understand our own culture’. 

 Our research investigated travellers who found a haven in Wales as a result of socio\-political events, revealing that refugees and exiles to Wales from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century tended to leave visual rather than textual traces behind of their host nation \[R1\]. Thus, artworks by influential refugee and exiled artists showing their impressions of the Welsh landscape and people featured prominently in the project’s exhibition **EuroVisions of Wales**. Educational booklets, adult learners’ and primary school workshops on refugee artists in Wales \(led by Jones\) were designed to disseminate the research in accessible forms and **raise awareness of the experiences of refugees and exiles past and present in Wales.** 

 The **co\-authored monograph **Hidden Texts, Hidden Nation** is the first full\-length study of European travel writing on Wales \[R1\], illustrating the interplay between identity and hegemony and the dynamics of intercultural relations and representation: Wales has been discovered, lost, then rediscovered. Jones’s research revealed that Wales was only treated on its own terms in European travel writing in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, beginning with French accounts of the 1904\-05 religious Revival. She discovered how prevalent 19th\-century European perceptions of Wales as a bastion of both Celtic tradition and modern industry re\-emerged in more fragmented sensory, physical and consumerist forms at the dawn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As Jones’s articles in the first\-ever **journal special issue** on travel writing and Wales show \[R3, R4\], diverse approaches to heritage and ethnic tourism result in polarised present\-day perspectives and imply a new political awareness of post\-devolution Wales. 

 Jones’s closing chapter to the monograph also draws on **new travelogues on Wales** that she commissioned from exiled authors from Turkey \(Meltem Arikan\) and former Yugoslavia \(Edin Suljic\), and international writers visiting Wales from Germany \(Jörg Bernig\) and France \(world\-renowned writer Marie Darrieussecq\) \[C8\]. These representations show that despite the greater visibility and accessibility of Wales, paradoxically it also remains peripheral: The Romantic evocation of Wales as a spiritual haven finds a counterpart in the 21st century, with the recurring portrayal of an ex\-centric/eccentric place of refuge and respite. Contemporary Wales still serves as a cultural\-political role model for Brittany, demonstrating the possibility for travellers from smaller nations to circumvent the centre in their accounts of travel to minoritized nations and cultures.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Enhancing awareness, understanding and educational practices** 

 **Educational beneficiaries** encompass primary school pupils and teachers, a pioneering Welsh\-government secondary schools’ network and adult learners. Swansea’s outreach work led to **increased awareness,** understanding and **changed educational practices**. These new resources and perspectives inform **national policy initiatives** valuing ethically informed citizenship and cultural diversity, and have **changed understandings** of Wales’s relationship with Europe and the experiences of refugees and exiles. Our research also has **global reach**: beneficiaries of our database \[R2\] span **6 continents and 70 countries**, and international HEIs have adopted it as a research tool \(e.g. a Leipzig University postgraduate course on ‘Wales in Travel Writing’\) \[C1\]. 

 The research project co\-created two **bilingual activity e\-books** for Key Stages 2 and 3 on **‘Refugees to Wales’** with the National Library of Wales’s Education unit \[C2\]. Published on Hwb \(Welsh Government Digital Learning e\-platform\) since November 2015, they have been viewed \(an above average\) more than 1300 times to date. The resources are recommended for school use by the Welsh Government working group on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Communities, Contributions and Cynefin in the New Curriculum \[C2\]. 

 The e\-books formed the basis of workshops with 284 Year 3\-6 primary school pupils in Welsh and English in Swansea, Llanelli, Brecon and Carmarthen led by Jones and Dr Aled Rees \(Swansea University\). The workshops **increased awareness and enhanced understanding** about the experiences of refugees in Wales past and present. ‘I learned that people come to Wales from all over the world because of Wars’ \[Year 3 pupil\]; ‘The workshop and materials fit perfectly with the core purpose of the new Welsh curriculum of **Ethical, Informed Citizens** ready to be citizens of Wales and the world’ \[Year 6 teacher\]. The workshops on refugee artists **enriched beneficiaries’ cultural lives** and impacted on teaching practice. Pupils wrote on luggage tags to reflect on refugee experiences and appreciated ‘experimenting with a new style in drawing’ \[Year 6 pupil\] and learning ‘art does not have to be perfect’ \[Year 5 pupil\] by creating drawings in the style of Polish Jewish refugee painter Josef Herman \[examples below and C3\]. ‘I am going to **change my practice** and allow the children to experiment further with different resources. In philosophy sessions we will look at and compare photographs and artists' pictures/paintings’ \[Year 5 Teacher\]. 



 Teachers at the June 2019 Welsh\-government SEREN \[ [<ins>https://gov.wales/seren\-network</ins>](https://gov.wales/seren-network)\] network workshop where Jones was invited to present emphasised the value of our multilingual educational materials and digital tools for independent learning in the **New Curriculum for Wales** areas of Languages, Literacy and Communication and the Humanities. ‘It’s incredibly valuable in enhancing pupils’ understanding of their locality \[…\] and how outsiders might perceive us’; ‘perfect for ticking the boxes of the Donaldson Review’s “Four Purposes” \[ambitious capable learners; healthy, confident individuals; enterprising, creative contributors; ethical, informed citizens\]. It’s wonderful that we can benefit from such extensive and fascinating research’ \[Year 7\-13 English teacher\] \[C3\]. Teachers also identified ‘further opportunities for partnership working \[with ETW\] as our project work in the Humanities begins to embed’ \[Deputy Headteacher\] \[C3\]. 

 Jones also developed a third sector partnership with the community\-based organization **Swansea City of Sanctuary** to develop an adult learners’ public workshop during the UK\-wide *Being Human* Festival of the Humanities in 2017. This workshop brought together asylum seekers and local learners and created new mutual understandings. Attendees appreciated the ‘personal approach, getting to know individuals’ and sharing their experiences of home and belonging in Swansea \[C4\]. Regional and national press coverage provided a broader platform for engagement between asylum seekers and the wider public \[C4\]. 

 **Heritage beneficiaries** 

 Our research on travel texts and visual art benefited **museums and galleries** by generating new display content in the interactive **EuroVisions of Wales** exhibition with public talks and workshops \[C5\] which toured Ceredigion Museum, Swansea Museum and Bangor’s Storiel Gallery \[11/07/15 – 2/07/16\]. ‘Swansea Museum found participation in the project very beneficial, both in terms of audience development and broadening our knowledge about the collections we and other museums and archives hold’. ‘The exhibition helped Swansea Museum to deliver our business plan objectives for 2015 / 2016, in particular to maintain high quality exhibitions and an events programme’. ‘Events such as prominent art historian Peter Lord’s public talk on Heinz Koppel were particularly effective in raising the profile of the museum and providing a rich visitor experience’ \[C5\]. The exhibition also gave our heritage beneficiaries ‘a **new framework** to exhibit additional travel\-related items from our own collections’ \[C5\]. ‘When I heard about the exhibition, I was glad to have the chance to contribute some of the family’s private documents to a new exhibit on my mother, which raised awareness of her contribution as a refugee to Wales’ \(son of German\-Jewish refugee and Egyptologist, Swansea Museum’s Keeper of Archaeology for 25 years\) \[C5\]. 14,615 visitors viewed the exhibition at Swansea Museum \[C6\], and their responses demonstrate its socio\-cultural benefit of **enhancing public understanding** of Wales’s relationship with Europe, e.g. ‘A wonderful, inspiring exhibition – so interesting to see how we’ve been seen through European eyes, and how European culture has enriched our own’ \[C6\]. This timely research on Welsh\-European relations is of significant interest in Wales \[e.g. Jones’s interview about the exhibition for *The Arts Show*, BBC Radio Wales \[06/01/2016\]; and more widely across the UK \[BBC News online article ‘What Euro Visitors have Thought of Wales in Past 260 Years’\] \[C7\]. 

 **Inspiring creative practices** 

 The project has benefited **creative industries** and **political debate** in Wales and beyond through inspiring and commissioning new travel writing, and working with external non\-profit organisations. Partnering with **Wales PEN Cymru**, an international association which promotes literature and defends the freedom of expression of writers worldwide, Jones commissioned four exilic/visiting travelogues for the multilingual ebook **Perthyn i Gymru / Belonging to Wales** \[C8\]. The collection fosters dialogue about Wales as a destination/home for travellers and refugees today. It ‘fits perfectly with Wales PEN Cymru’s values of inclusion, diversity and equality’, and through this collaboration ‘we were able to achieve one of the organisation’s main aims – to support exiled writers’ \[C8\]. Distributed and discussed at the 2019 Hay Festival event ‘Freedom Writers: Censorship in Turkey and Exile in Wales’, it has enjoyed positive reader responses at a time when Europeans’ sense of belonging in the UK has been widely undermined by Brexit, e.g. described on Twitter as ‘my dream book’ by a Frenchwoman resident in Wales. 

 ‘The European Travellers to Wales project inspired the *Belonging to Wales* series’ in the *Welsh Agenda* magazine of the independent think tank **Institute of Welsh Affairs**, which ‘provides platforms for debate’ and ‘attracts more than 50,000 unique visitors every year’ \[C9\]. Republishing our commissioned travelogues in this **new** **major series** ‘inform\[ed\] the shape of future contributions from European nationals’, set ‘a template for other essayistic exploratory writing’, ‘further\[ed\] our own networks among exiled communities’, and ‘inspired in turn a new strand of online content “People and Places”’. ‘The early success of the “People and Places” strand has attracted sponsorship from Coastal Housing, and we aim to use this new partnership to fund further contributions from diverse, marginalised writers who would otherwise not have access to making their voices, opinions and stories heard in a high\-profile magazine’ \[C9\]. Our research has thereby given a platform to underrepresented and marginalised voices, which in turn help others, including young people, to think and act more confidently as creative, ethically informed citizens.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lancaster’s research on reliability modelling technologies has been used by ST Microelectronics \(STM\) to achieve mass market penetration of its inertial MEMS \(Micro\-Electro\-Mechanical Systems\) products. Since 2014, these inertial devices that include accelerometers and gyroscopes have contributed USD3.5 billion in sales revenue for ST Microelectronics. Markets over this period include the iPhone 4 and 4S \(included in 15 million units sold between January and September 2014\), the iPhone 5C \(included in 22 million units sold between 2014 and 2015\), the Nintendo Wii and Wii U \(included in 11.9 million units sold between 2014 and 2017\) and the Nintendo Switch \(70 million unit sold between 2017 and 2020\). Penetration into the automotive market has also been achieved that has built upon both reliability and test methodology research delivered to ST Microelectronics by the Lancaster team. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 MEMS \(Micro Electro Mechanical Systems\) are miniaturised components with moving structures having dimensions that are typically between 100 nanometres and 100 microns. These components are manufactured from a substrate material using etching and material deposition processes rather than mechanical assembly and can be manufactured in large quantities at low cost. The technology is well suited to sensing and actuation, offering more compact solutions than conventional technologies. Applications do however typically require high quality at low cost for consumer markets and fault tolerance in aerospace, defence, medical and transport applications. 

 On\-line test and efficient reliability modelling are hence crucial technologies for these products. Led by Professor Andrew Richardson, underpinning research at Lancaster University has focused on the reliability modelling, characterisation and optimisation technology needed to demonstrate that the active structures in MEMS devices can withstand the mechanical and thermal stress typical in consumer market applications. It has also demonstrated that the reliability required by potential customers, together with the test features needed for low cost manufacture and in\-field self\-test, is achievable. 

 Early research by Richardson’s team at Lancaster under the EU FP4 “ASTERIS” Project 26354 \(1998\-2001, EUR1.65 million\) had explored the potential for utilising behavioural methods for modelling defects and degradation across the electronics to micromechanical interface within accelerometers, magnetometers and pressure sensors. This built on new inventions at Lancaster involving threshold comparator\-based level checking for validating the integrity of microsensors through electrical\-only design for test concepts. 

 Further research conducted by the Richardson Team at Lancaster delivered the first validated and practical solutions for component level fault modelling in microstructures. These findings were initially peer reviewed and published at the  [SPIE Design, Test and Packaging Conference](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/dtip.2003.1287023) in 2003 \(and extended through invited publication in Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing in 2004 \[3.1\]. This research was carried out in collaboration with  [ST Microelectronics](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/corporate/company/company_presentation/28/d9/f6/e4/38/de/44/dc/profile.pdf/files/profile.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.profile.pdf) \(a world leading French\-Italian multinational electronics and semiconductor manufacturer with 46,000 employees worldwide and annual revenue of USD9.7 billion\) under the EU FP5 project “MACROS” IST\-2001\-34714 \(2002\-2005, EUR1.6 million\) that produced new behavioural modelling techniques based around applications of Cosserat theory developed since 2002 by Professor Robin Tucker, Head of Lancaster’s Industrial Mathematics Group. This insight opened the possibility of building component models of MEMS structures under different stress conditions that would be difficult if not impossible to construct using conventional analytical techniques. The methodology also supported the modelling of package\-induced and residual stress on the behaviour of the MEMS inertial devices. All of this research was conducted by Richardson’s Team at Lancaster and used to validate novel capacitance and optical methods for the exploration of mechanical fatigue in the structural material used in ST Microelectronics MEMS products. The work also covered reliability hazards such as residual and package stress induced in a commercial test structure \[3.2\]. Within this research, the Lancaster team invented both the modelling methodology and created the specific reliability models for the test structure studied. This research was published in Microsystem Technologies \[3.2\] and also selected through peer review for publication in the ST Journal of Research \(Volume 3 \- Number 1 – MEMS, 2005 ISSN:1828\-2105\). 

 The extension of this research through the European Network of Excellence in Design for Micro & Nano Manufacture \(PATENT\-DfMM, FP6\-507255 EUR6.2 million, 2004\-2009\) involved the application of the behavioural modelling strategy deployed on the test structures of \[3.2\] to a silicon gyroscope test structure supplied by ST Microelectronics \[3.3\]. This research was carried out in collaboration with ST and informed the evolution of their gyroscope MEMS technology and its subsequent uptake by companies including Apple. The methods used involved the novel application of component level fault models based on Cosserat theory that were realised by the Richardson Team and Till Wiegand, a student seconded to Lancaster from the University of Bremen. This collaborative work with ST Microelectronics stimulated further research by Richardson’s Team into methods of monitoring integrated MEMS technology using test methods that can be activated whilst the device is in normal use in the field. Initial research at Lancaster involved the invention of the “Bias Superposition” method that stimulated interest from QinetiQ, the French National Centre for Scientific Research \(CNRS\), the University of Paris and Oxley Developments. This work resulted in a major paper in Sensors and Actuators A, written in collaboration with CNRS, QinetiQ and the University of Paris \[3.4\]. ST Microelectronics, although not included in the author list chaired the industrial advisory board reviewing, advising and guiding this work. The core technique associated with the reported “Bias Superposition” method, involving the injection of test stimuli into the bias chain, was invented at Lancaster. Applications research with QinetiQ \[3.5\] was also delivered by Lancaster; subsequent application of the Lancaster method to a ST Microelectronics Magnetometer was carried out by CNRS and the University of Paris.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The author’s REF2014 case study detailed the economic impact, of the research described in Section 2, on the ability of ST Microelectronics to secure contracts for their inertial devices from multinational companies including Nintendo \(Wii\). This continuing case study details the ongoing economic impact on ST Microelectronics, specifically through sales revenue associated with inertial MEMS products that totals USD3.5 billion since 2014. These devices have had a specific impact on a number of industry sectors including consumer and automotive electronics. Significant contributors to this overall impact \[5.4\] include the LIS331DLH accelerometer and the L3G4200D gyroscope in the iPhone 4 and 4S \(included in 15 million units sold between January and September 2014\) \[5.2\], the gyroscope in the iPhone 5C \(totalling 22 million units sold in 2014 and 2015\) \[5.2\], the Nintendo Wii and Wii U \(included in 11.9 million units sold between 2014 and 2017\) \[5.7\] and the 6\-axis inertial sensors in the Nintendo Switch \(totalling 70 million sales between 2017\-2020\) \[5.1\]. In the automotive market, the release of products including the AIS328DQ 3 axis accelerometer, the A3G4250D 3 axis gyroscope and the  [ASM330LHH ](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/asm330lhh.html)inertial measurement unit has built on the ability of ST Microelectronics to deploy design for reliability and reliability evaluation methodologies to deliver very low field failure rates at low cost. Here, the work described in section 2 has assisted ST Microelectronics to establish a solid platform for success in the airbag market with growing applications in roll detection and advanced driver assistance systems \[5.3\]. 

 The application of the research described in \[3.1\], \[3.2\] and later in \[3.3\] supported ST Microelectronics in commercialising new products and processes. The research reported in \[3.1\] and \[3.2\] was used to provide reliability data associated with materials, the fabrication process and moving structures within MEMS test devices that was essential to the uptake of ST Microelectronics MEMS accelerometers and gyroscopes. The characterisation technology developed through this research, together with further work with ST Microelectronics on the gyroscope \[3.3\] also delivered an optimised design and provided ST Microelectronics with enabling reliability analysis tools. The enabling research \[3.1\-3.3\] also provided ST Microelectronics with a means to validate, through simulation, the effectiveness of several reliability characterisation methods in revealing potential reliability hazards within manufactured structures. It also supported research that validated the shock resistance of the original 3D accelerometers and gyroscope sensor to 10,000g, essential for robustness requirements in consumer applications. The penetration of ST Microelectronics inertial sensors into the automotive market has been supported by all the work described above with collaborative research associated with embedded test \[for example 3.5 where ST Microelectronics where advisers\] providing an important contribution to the methodology associated with “Aerospace Quality at Automotive Prices”. 

 Benedetto Vigna, President of the Analog, MEMS and Sensor Group and member of the executive group for ST Microelectronics confirmed that the “research collaboration started in 2002 through the MACROS EU project \(IST\-2001\-34714\) and extended into the PATENT DfMM Network of Excellence \(507255\) \[outputs include 3.2\- 3.5\] and beyond during which time your team carried out the modelling and characterisation work associated with the reliability evaluation of our MEMS inertial sensing technology. This work had a significant contribution to ST Microelectronics in both our ability to prove the reliability of this technology and hence achieve market penetration that included the Nintendo Wii and subsequently the Apple iPhone. The modelling and reliability evaluation methodologies that are used today still find their roots in the work that you and your extended team led within these two European projects carried out in collaboration with the MEMS team in ST Microelectronics *.”* \[5.4\] 

 Of significance in the context of market retention is the ease in which reliability evaluation methodologies can be ported between product generations. The 45% footprint reduction achieved within the gyroscope in the iPhone 5 \[5.5\] relative to the iPhone 4 required both a reduction in the critical dimensions in the MEMS structure and advances in the packing process whilst maintaining competitive levels of reliability. As \[5.4\] and the extract above from ST Microelectronics indicate, the methodologies delivered have also contributed to this capability and supported the evolution of existing markets with Nintendo \[5.6\]. 

 In conclusion, the impact of the research detailed in sections 2 and 3 on the ability of ST Microelectronics to penetrate key consumer markets, including the Apple iPhone and Nintendo Switch, in addition to the growing automotive market, is highly significant.   As of September 2012, ST Microelectronics had shipped 2 billion MEMS sensors that confirmed its leading global position in MEMS technology for consumer and portable application \(Market Analyst IHS iSupply\).  By August 2020 this had grown significantly to 17 billion parts sold \[5.3\] with USD3.5 billion in revenue between January 2014 and August 2020 being associated with Inertial MEMS devices alone.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken by the Digital Theory, Technology and Practice \(DTTP\) group within the Centre for Art, Design, Research and Experimentation \(CADRE\) has engendered significant impact and recognition through engaging with new audiences and influencing creative practice. Research projects include cross\-disciplinary research practice in design, technology and performance with a domestic and international impact, including; 

-  A funded three\-year arts residency to improve the lives of offenders; 

-  Arts Council and Wellcome Trust funded experimental films and collaborative award\-winning animations that explore the mapping of spaces, hidden history and science; and 

-  Experimental films and performance works have led to new work, extended international reach, and have pushed the boundaries of video installation and dance. 

 Over 200,000 people in the UK and internationally have engaged with our research.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Grounded in research and theory, DTTP’s work extends back 37 years and brings together practitioners and theorists. Working collaboratively with people from inside and outside of academia, its researchers experiment and innovate with the technological, performative and interactive potential of digital and analogue technology. 

 The research is given force through its Findings, \[F\], enabling the work to be instrumentalised in a beneficial and impactful way. 

 <ins>F</ins><ins>1</ins><ins>. The Role of the Arts in the Rehabilitation of Offenders</ins> 

 Kelland’s analogue and digital media slapstick performances investigate the construction of identity and masculinity in British comedy. Funded by the Marie\-Louise von Motesiczky Charitable Trust, Kelland is artist in residence for the Ikon Gallery at HMP Grendon \(2019\-2022\) \[R1\], developing his artwork together with that of the prison residents. 

 HMP Grendon operates a Democratic Therapeutic Community \(DTC\) to provide group based therapy within a social climate promoting positive relationships and social participation, allowing Kelland’s work to take seed and produce a beneficial impact. 

 <ins>F</ins><ins>2</ins><ins>. Moving Image Technology</ins><ins>;</ins> <ins>Mapping the Spaces of History</ins> <ins>and Science</ins> 

 Both Moore and Kossoff experiment with the aesthetic and technological potential of the documentary film, exploring the moving image to conceptualise space, history and time. After making films for television, Kossoff developed his experimental essayistic films, distributed by the BFI and LUX. His exploration of space and architecture was seen in *Goldfinger’s Playground* \(2008\), exhibited in the collaborative group exhibition, *Welcome to the Playground* \(2015\) by Turner Prize winners Assemble. His work has extended Walter Benjamin’s writing on technology, space and montage into film \( *Walter Benjamin Trilogy*, 2009\-2013\). *Animal Architecture* \(2015\), made in collaboration with Dudley Zoo, evidences his research with 16mm analogue film \[R2\]. 

 Alongside this, Moore is a pioneer in documentary\-animation, and frequently collaborates with scientists, many with Wellcome Trust funding. Emerging conceptually from 2016’s *Loop* \[R3\], 2019’s *Bloomers* is a window into the everyday working lives of British factory workers, furthering Moore’s research into the hand\-drawn and the digital. Moore featured in the documentary *Secrets of Animation* \(BBC4, 2019\). 

 Also working in arts and new technologies, Doyle’s research on the impact of emerging technologies on practices across a diverse range of creative fields \[R4\] has shaped the mapping of diverse spaces, most notably regarding digital embodiment, virtual worlds, VR/AR and mixed reality, phenomenological research methods, and digital narratives. 

 <ins>F</ins><ins>3</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins> </ins><ins>Collaborative Experimentation in Performance and the Moving Image</ins> 

 The longest serving member of the group, Sherwin’s experimental film and curatorial practice involves single screen, installation and performances, foregrounding the moving image as a technological artefact. This is evident in his curated shows, for example *Live Cinema: Retrospective Screenings* \(2006\-07\) at Palais Beaux Arts, Brussels and *Film in Space* at the Camden Arts Centre \(2012\-2013\). *Paper Landscape,* first performed in 1975, evolved into a digitised form \(Tate Gallery, 2015\). A variant of this work, *Paper Shadows* \(2016\) \[R5\], was conceived during his residency at Studio Kura, Japan. 

 With their slapstick\-based work, using performance and the moving image, collaborators Harrison and John Wood \(Bath Spa University\) have exhibited in over 20 countries e.g. Tokyo \(2015\) and Lisbon \(2017\). They featured in the BBC4 documentary; *Kill Your TV: Jim Moir’s Weird World Of Video Art* \(2019\). Their early practice defined their exploration of the durational and spatial properties of the moving image, while their recent work *Very Clear Instructions* \(2018\) \[R6\], was developed in collaboration with Ballet British Columbia and Polygon Gallery Vancouver.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact has resulted in the enhancement of quality of life for a broad range of people. It resides in two main areas that are connected by their collaborative engagement with communities, experimentation and technology. 

 <ins>I</ins><ins>1</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins> </ins><ins>Art and Design in the Enhancement of Quality of Life: The Role of the Arts in the Rehabilitation of Offenders</ins> 

 Impact resulting in the enhancement of quality of life has manifested itself in the role of the arts in the rehabilitation of offenders. Kelland was appointed Ikon Gallery artist in resident at HMP Grendon \(2019\-2022\). This engendered collaborative engagement and practice between Kelland and offenders. Symposia, online presentations, exhibitions were amongst the events that took place, including the Koestler Award. These awards are for arts in criminal justice and every year over 3,500 people in custody and in the community share their creative work by taking part. The Koestler Awards provide feedback and encouragement to entrants of all abilities in visual art, design, writing and music. After the exhibition, there were many positive evaluations, one prisoner stating: “I thought it an amazing experience. Began to actually feel like a ‘real boy’ again. Thanks for the awesome opportunity.” A visitor said: “Wonderful and inspiring, would very much like to attend HMP Grendon for another exhibition” \[C1\]. Grendon’s Governor stated: “The artist’s contribution to life at HMP Grendon is highly valued by our communities and really helps to turn the men’s lives around” \[C2\]. Impact is society wide and promotes life\-changing experiences for the prisoners \[F1\]. 

 <ins>I</ins><ins>2</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins> </ins><ins>Enhanced cultural understanding of issues and phenomena; shaping and informing public attitudes and values</ins> 

 a\) Moving Image Technology Mapping the Spaces of History 

 Impact has derived from an embedded collaborative endeavour, guaranteeing relevance both to stakeholders and the general public as beneficiaries. Kossoff’s *The Anarchist Rabbi* \(2014, distributed by LUX and BFI\) uncovered forgotten architectural spaces of London. It screened internationally and was reviewed in *Sight and Sound*, in November 2014\) \[C3\]. Of the film, Porton wrote: ‘Mourning the fact that urban renewal and gentrification obliterate the traces of radical legacy, the film is a powerful meditation on the potency of a subversive “hidden history”.’ \[C4\] *Animal Architecture* \(2015\), shot on 16mm film, was made in collaboration with and exhibited at Dudley Zoo and Wolverhampton Art Gallery. It had 125,000 visitors for its six\-month run, workshops for visitors and zoo workers, and is now screened for educational visits. Arts Council funded, 

 “…It proved to be an excellent addition to our \(Heritage Lottery Fund\) project, enabling visitors to gain an insight into the history and giving a different perspective on the zoo... visitors commented that the film enabled them to see the architecture and design of the zoo for the first time.” \[C5\] 

 Moore’s multi\-award winning *Loop* \(2016\), was part of Animate Projects *Silent Signals*, a collaboration with scientists. It culminated in a touring exhibition, seminars and film festivals \(2016\-2018\). The Jury of FAFF \(Factual Animation Film Fuss, 2016\) gave the film a special mention: “We thought the attention to detail was superb, especially the details of the process \- which could be so dry, but are cleverly presented to the audience. We felt that the visual articulation of the unseen was great. And we felt that it was a great achievement to successfully bring the process of making into the fabric of the film.” \[C6\] 

 Moore’s *Bloomers* \(2019\), funded by Klangforum Wien and Arts Council England, was part of the *Happiness Machine Project* involving ten women animators working with composers. Awards in 2019 include best documentary at the third ReAnima International Festival and Best British Film at the London International Animation Festival. Working with factory workers in a knicker factory, Moore utilised both a hand\-made and digital approach: “My favourite piece… was *Bloomers…* The film takes the viewer into the sewing room of a family run factory…a touching window into the everyday working lives of factory workers” \[C7\]. *Bloomers* was originally performed live by Klangforum Wien, New Music Festival, where 2,000 people attended. 

 Utilising innovative aesthetic forms, these films have informed and shaped public attitudes and values and given the over 200,000 people who have seen them new perspectives on history and space they would never otherwise have encountered \[F2\]. 

 b\) Collaborative Experimentation in the Moving Image and Performance 

 The theme of moving image cutting edge technological and aesthetic experimentation applies to work of Harrison and Sherwin, with the added element of perfomativity \[F3\]: 

 Harrison and Wood’s collaborative conceptual slapstick *Some Things Are Hard to Explain* \(2015\-16, ICC, Tokyo\) crosses global boundaries. Commentator John L. Tran wrote: “… every visitor seems to be enthralled enough to watch every video from beginning to end… What distinguishes the exhibition from a science\-museum exhibit for kids, is the subtext that being socialized into the drudgery of everyday modern life can deaden our sense of wonder at the order of the cosmos, and distract us from acknowledging the absurdity of human activity in the greater scheme of things.” \[C8\] 

 Sherwin’s solo exhibition of expanded film challenged audiences to reflect upon analogue and digital film, and the role of the spectator in constructing meaning. *Light Cycles* \(Christine Park Gallery, 2016\) displayed Sherwin’s cutting\-edge exploration of the aesthetics of film technology: “…Sherwin, as well as anyone, explores this distinction for the art of film, and does so without an axe to grind… he invites us to take an aesthetic pleasure in understanding the process.” \[C9\] 

 Impact has been generated through the cultural understanding of issues and phenomena using a relational interplay between technology and the arts.
