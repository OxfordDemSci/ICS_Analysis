 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Professor Laura Bear has provided anthropological insights to Covid\-19 responses at the highest levels of the UK Government. Bear is the only anthropologist to be a member of the central coordinating group of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours and the Ethnicity subgroup, which deliver expert advice to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) on behavioural interventions. She has introduced a social calculus \(reduction of inequality and prevention of adverse impact on disadvantaged/minoritized groups\) to government policy. Since March 2020, her work has significantly impacted scientific advice provided by SAGE to the Covid\-19 Strategy and Covid\-19 Operations committees in No. 10 and to the Health Secretary. In addition, her work has directly led to policy design in the Government Communication Service Behavioural Science Unit, Public Health England, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Bear has conducted extensive work on the anthropology of policy, including analysis of the effects of austerity on relations of care and kinship **\[1\]**. Drawing on long\-term ethnographic research funded by the ESRC among precarious workers in India, she has stressed the need for government decision\-making to be informed by a “social calculus” and new practices of the public good that prioritise the reduction of inequality **\[1\] \[2\]**. The social calculus measures policy according to whether it improves the capacity of precarious communities to plan for the future and the extent to which it reduces entrenched disadvantage **\[3\] \[4\]**. Unusually this approach considers impacts on relations of social reproduction and kinship. Continuing this research in the UK as part of the ESRC\-funded Rebuilding Macroeconomics project, Bear argued for attention to be paid to whether fiscal and welfare policy allows community networks of care and family relations to thrive **\[5\]**. The ethnographic methodologies she deploys are uniquely suited to reveal the multilayered impact of government decision\-making on communities. 

 Bear’s expertise in the anthropology of policy and ethnographic methods, and the concept of the social calculus, in particular, led to her being invited in late March 2020 to join the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours \(SPI\-B\). At the same time, she convened a group of LSE anthropologists to research the unequal impacts of the Covid\-19 pandemic on communities and their networks of informal and formal care in the UK \(funded by an LSE Covid Rapid Response Grant\). Under Bear’s leadership this group has conducted rapid\-response research throughout the pandemic **\[6\]**, focusing especially on disadvantaged and minoritized communities in London and the Midlands. This research has been ongoing and responsive to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) and government department policy needs, feeding via Bear’s contributions into 14 evidence papers and policy measures related to co\-production, care, and community support. It has also provided an independent analysis of community concerns, charting the following, in particular: excess death and commemorations **\[7\]**; an increasing care gap in areas of multiple deprivation; new forms of mutuality and community self\-help linked to local authority pandemic responses; and rising forms of stigma and exclusion **\[6\]**. 

 As its first project, the LSE group, led by Bear, carried out a public survey and 58 cross\-community interviews leading to the report, “‘A Good Death’ During the Covid\-19 Pandemic in the UK” **\[7\]**. The report explored the ways in which government communications and policy could be used to support and prepare communities and households for Covid\-19 deaths. Research explored “what a good death looks like” for people across all faiths and especially for disadvantaged groups. It examined how communities were already adapting to processes of dying, burial, funerals, and bereavement during the pandemic, and how they were responding to new government regulations. The report focused specifically on five moments in the process of death: pre\-admission; hospital admission; disposal and release of the body; funerals; and bereavement. It proposed policy measures to ameliorate the experience of loss and foster social cohesion in each of these settings. These included the assertion of a right to a dignified death for all communities, with a prioritisation of this in all future social restrictions; compassionate government communications around the scale of the national loss; dignified practices of death in hospitals and in crematoria; and special targeted communications for those bereaved as a result of Covid\-19. 

 Bear then directed the LSE group, from April 2020 to the present, in a study of how national and local social restrictions had disrupted formal and informal support networks, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged and minoritized groups **\[6\]**. This work \(based on extensive interviewing over several months and a survey of 3,800 people\) shows that, because government policy was initially blind to the significance of community care and kinship, it had broken relationships essential to socio\-economic life in the UK. Its pandemic, social welfare, and economic policies at first did not recognise the new care burdens emerging at the local level. Alongside this, austerity had undermined essential financial support, links, and information exchange between third sector, voluntary, and community organisations and local authorities. This left the UK ill\-prepared to deal with and recover from the pandemic. Further problems were caused by a rise of political blame narratives and a stigmatisation of minoritized communities or places under lockdown, particularly as national restrictions changed into local interventions from June 2020 onwards. In addition, government rules were difficult to follow and caused alienation because they ran against the grain of social practices of childcare, religious life, and elder care, while prioritising economic opening. These rules and policies have caused particular problems for the extensively networked families of minoritized or socio\-economically disadvantaged groups, undermining government legitimacy. The research also gave a detailed account of the ways in which the pandemic had reverberated through, and caused deep distress to, the community and relational life of those in other sectors. Overall, social recovery and cohesion were potentially placed at risk as a result of policies that had not yet fully adopted a social calculus **\[6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Bear is currently the only anthropologist member of SPI\-B and the Ethnicity subgroup of SAGE. This position has enabled her to contribute a unique perspective based on a social calculus to the UK Government’s handling of Covid\-19 policy. She has led on or co\-authored 14 papers for SAGE on key strategies related to: support bubbles; social restrictions and interventions; ethnicity and Covid\-19 disparity; co\-production; and community aid initiatives **\[A\]**. She has also worked with the Cabinet Office, Civil Contingencies Secretariat \(CCS\), Public Health England \(PHE\), and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\) on the design of communications and policy. 

 **Informing new policy relating to the management and commemoration of death**The “Good Death” report **\[7\]** was produced in response to an urgent CCS and Government Communication Service Behavioural Science Team \(GCS\) request to investigate how to deal humanely with excess death during the first wave \(47,243 excess deaths from 7 March to 8 May 2020 in England and Wales; 37,295 Covid\-19\-related\). They wanted to understand attitudes and practices towards loss, funerals, and burial among different ethnic and faith communities. The research revealed a common concern across all communities, which was that they wanted a dignified process of death enabled by access to relatives in hospital, larger observances at funerals, and national acknowledgement of the traumatic losses occurring. In addition, the report recommended that particular effort should be put into briefing and funding bereavement charities. Once finished, the CCS and GCS circulated key insights to communications teams in the Department of Work and Pensions, HMRC, Ministry of Justice, MHCLG, and the Daily Covid Conference Briefing Team **\[B\] \[C\]**. As a result, on 15 April the Health Secretary announced a range of new policies that would give families the “right to say goodbye to loved ones” in care homes, hospitals, and at funerals, and for the first time acknowledged the national losses occurring **\[D\]**. This humane policy, emphasising the right to a dignified death and altering the experience of mourning the dead for families across the UK **\[E\]**, has continued through the second lockdown. 

 The influence and value of the ""Good Death"" report has subsequently been confirmed by the GCS Cabinet Office Behavioural Science team leaders: "" *The 'Good Death' report was one of the most influential pieces of external research that we have been able to draw on during the CV19 pandemic...\[It\] has helped the GCS Behavioural Science team put anthropological approaches as one really key learning of what communications should draw on going forward, and we embedded the 'Good Death' report also in more tangential communications challenges such as communicating with the BAME community \(where we were able to draw out differences between groups and their socio\-political relevance\). It has changed our Behavioural Science approach to incorporate anthropological ways of thinking about problems, and we will be looking into deepening our own expertise in this area, too*"" **\[B\]**. Furthermore, the Government Chief Scientific Adviser has described how the report has been “ *recognised as a paper of particular distinction and impact by colleagues in the Cabinet Office*"" **\[A\]**. 

 **Changing the UK Government’s approach to care** 

 In the first wave of the pandemic from March to April 2020, families were unable to form support bubbles, except for childcare between separated parents. In early May, as SAGE were considering how to open up after the national restrictions, they asked SPI\-B to explore the behavioural considerations around social bubbling as practiced in New Zealand, Canada, and Guernsey. Bear was asked to lead on this paper and to consider the social support implications and behavioural effects of the sequencing of allowing various households to join. Drawing on the concepts of a social calculus **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\] \[4\] \[5\]** applied to the specific community and kinship structures of the UK, she recommended that social connections between households should be allowed early in the reopening of UK society **\[F\]**. This policy recommendation was designed to relieve the burdens of care in UK families and enable extended networks of socio\-economically disadvantaged and minority groups to reconnect for support. It was also intended to signal the importance of mutuality and care as central to government policy. This advice was conveyed through SAGE to No. 10 committees dealing with the pandemic. The government subsequently prioritised childcare ties between all households and single individuals joining with households in their 11 May 2020 recovery plan. Bear drew on the ongoing findings of the LSE Covid and Care Research Group **\[6\]** to amplify and extend this advice on social connections to SAGE and the Ethnicity subgroup and the range of permitted support bubbles has been greatly extended **\[G\]**. In addition, bubbles were deployed during Christmas to enable families that had been apart for a long time to meet in areas of the country where transmission levels permitted **\[H\]**. The Government Chief Scientific Adviser has attested to the usefulness of Bear's input and the continuing influence of her advice: "" *In particular, advice titled 'Well\-being and Household Connection' \(14 May 2020\) which Prof Bear was the lead writer on, contributed to support bubble policies deployed by the government in the recovery from the first wave, and which have continued through the Christmas period and now as we emerge from the second wave*"" **\[A\]**. He also highlighted her contribution to the Ethnicity subgroup which led SAGE “ *to focus on household transmission in general and its specific risks for some groups, which will be particularly important as we embed new practices in everyday life to emerge from the second wave*"" **\[A\]**. Bear held the government to account in relation to these issues by authoring a newspaper article and Lancet article **\[I\] \[J\]**. The impact of a changing government approach to the significance of care relations and social support can be seen in the current regulations **\[K\]**. 

 **Altering the UK Government’s approach to local interventions** 

 In the government’s 11 May 2020 recovery plan, “local lockdowns” were an important means of preventing and limiting the transmission of Covid\-19. A priority was to manage new outbreaks by detecting infection “hotspots” and using targeted measures to tackle these. Effective local lockdowns were integral to the release of the national lockdown: by controlling the spread of the virus within a particular area, they were intended to delay the need to re\-impose social distancing restrictions across the whole country. 

 However, the ongoing research by the LSE Covid and Care Research group on the effects in the first local restriction area, Leicester, demonstrated the great social costs of this policy **\[6\]**. Not only was social support restricted, causing care burdens to intensify, but also social cohesion and the legitimacy of the measures were adversely affected. PHE were also concerned by the potential negative effects of local interventions and asked Bear to carry out some rapid\-action research for them in Leicester, which was also shared with the Cabinet Office **\[L\]**. At the same time, SPI\-B, with co\-authorship by Bear, presented a briefing to SAGE **\[M\]**. This drew directly on the research carried out at LSE and a paper on co\-production co\-authored by Bear **\[N\]**. This paper emphasised how a more just set of social policies could be generated even in rapid response situations by prioritising engagement with “local experts”. These were not people in formal roles, but individuals who sit at nodes of dense interconnecting social networks and can speak to a variety of experiences. These engagements would need to go beyond well\-known “leaders”, to explore a range of usually excluded perspectives including those within sub\-communities. The paper encouraged deep reflection on the part of local authorities on who their key communities were. It also recommended that existing spaces of mutual engagement between communities should be the setting for these consultations. The aim of these would be not just to give feedback on policy but to develop different policies at the local level in relation to particular situations. 

 The SPI\-B local interventions briefing recommended this form of local planning through co\-production with regional public health teams; public health officers in the local authority in consultation with a wide range of communities. It also suggested the renaming of local lockdowns as “interventions”. This terminology was subsequently reflected in government guidance for local decision\-makers on containing Covid\-19 **\[O\]**. Even more importantly, co\-production and ethnographic research were embedded in PHE to ensure consultation and co\-production in areas of local intervention. A broader debate on local interventions also began in the press, holding the government to account **\[P\]**. As stated by the PHE Head of Behavioural Science Covid\-19 Behavioural Science and Insights Unit, research by Bear and her team “ *has been pivotal to the strategies of local social interventions during the Covid\-19 pandemic, through rapid responsive research and evaluation, and the use of ethnographic methodologies… \[it\] contributed to the implementation of PHE and its partners’ local response. We began to focus on liaisons with local authorities and community groups and started to use more extensive ethnographic methods and evidence to generate greater co\-production*” **\[L\]**. 

 **Initiating community responses and new forms of co\-production** 

 The importance of community consultation and co\-production in generating policy moves in line with a social calculus is at the core of Bear’s research **\[1\] \[6\]**. This has now become central to the UK Government’s response to preventing transmission, improving vaccine uptake, and developing greater health equity. Bear co\-authored a briefing for SAGE on Community Champions as a response to dealing with the pandemic, particularly among disadvantaged and minority communities **\[Q\]**. This included findings from the LSE Covid and Care Research Group in relation to the importance of cooperation between local community groups and local authorities in responding to public health and trust issues around Covid\-19 **\[6\]**. As a result of this, Bear has been directly advising MHCLG on the design, implementation, and evaluation of its Community Champions policy since October 2020. Drawing on her recommendations on supporting community recovery, co\-production, and cooperative efforts in areas of multiple deprivation worst hit by the Covid\-19 pandemic, 60 local authorities are now running Community Champion schemes with government funding to achieve these ends **\[R\] \[S\]**. MHCLG intend this approach, based on a social calculus, to be the foundation for a more equitable recovery from the pandemic across the UK **\[T\]**. Bear's research and advice have been vital to the development of this programme, as confirmed by the Deputy Director, Faith Integration and Communities at MHCLG: "" *Professor Bear has since October 2020 provided crucial advice that has been central to our design, implementation and evaluation of our new MHCLG Community Champions programme...It was on the basis of \[her\] writings and our weekly conversations that we formulated our approach to the Community Champions initiative. Professor Bear contributed directly to the overall design, call for proposals from local authorities, training, and evaluation process. Her ideas, writings and assistance have led to the current success of the programme which is running in 60 local authorities in the most deprived areas of the UK*"" **\[T\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Radiocarbon \(<sup>14</sup>C\) is the most frequently used approach to dating organic artefacts from the last 55,000 years. However, all radiocarbon dating requires calibration to transform <sup>14</sup>C measurements into calendar ages. The IntCal Working Group \(IWG\) is an international team of 27 scientists formed in 2001 to establish criteria for calibration data and methods for curve construction. Sheffield researchers conducted the key research that gave rise to the curve being developed. The IntCal calibration curve has international reach as the global standard for radiocarbon calibration, being used by all major commercial <sup>14</sup>C laboratories. It has underpinned global climate change policy, and impacted archaeological practice and planning and development decisions in the heritage sector.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Radiocarbon dating relies on the simple idea that, while alive, organisms take in carbon from their surroundings and so have a ratio of isotope <sup>12</sup>C to <sup>14</sup>C that is in equilibrium with their atmosphere. Once an organism dies, it stops taking in new carbon, the stable <sup>12</sup>C remains but the <sup>14</sup>C decays at a known rate. Measuring the ratio of <sup>14</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C left in a sample therefore provides a dating technique. 

 If the concentration of atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C had been constant throughout history, this would be straightforward. However, it has fluctuated significantly. In order to date organisms precisely scientists need calibration curves, which provide a reliable historical record of this <sup>14</sup>C variation to accurately transform their radiocarbon measurements into calendar ages. Uncalibrated radiocarbon measurements differ substantially from the best estimates of actual calendar dates and so are of little interpretive value. Sheffield researchers, together with their international collaborators, provide the globally ratified standard for this calibration via the series of IntCal calibration curves. 

 The IntCal Working Group \(IWG\) is an international team of 27 scientists formed in 2001 to establish criteria for calibration data and methods for curve construction. Sheffield researchers have been members since 2001. The key research that gave rise to the impact was undertaken at the University of Sheffield, between 2001 and 2014, by Professor Caitlin Buck, and Professor Paul Blackwell and Dr Tim Heaton \(UoA 10\). It involved development of a fully probabilistic modelling framework for estimating radiocarbon calibration curves and a suite of Bayesian implementation methods that can be extended as new data structures become available. 

 Sheffield models and methods have been used for all IntCal curve updates since 2004. The group produces three regularly updated curves dependent upon the environment where the object to be dated obtained its carbon: IntCalXX \(where XX represents the year of release\) for the Northern Hemispheric atmosphere, SHCalXX for the Southern Hemisphere, and MarineXX for the world’s oceans. These updates \(in 2004 **\[R1\]**, 2009 **\[R2\]**, 2013 **\[R3\]**\) replaced the previous curves and were made as our understanding of the Earth system advanced and new data sets, such as tree rings, plant macrofossils, or corals, became available. Each update provided new challenges for the Sheffield team members as the unique elements of the calibration data led to modelling complexity. These required bespoke solutions and close collaboration with co\-authors to ensure their expert knowledge was incorporated. The 2009 update provided an extension of the calibration curves back from 24,000 \(their previous limit\) to 50,000 years before present, allowing calibration for the full limit of the radiocarbon technique for the first time. This required Sheffield to provide a careful statistical synthesis of a variety of new reference data sources and novel uncertainty quantification **\[R4, R5\]**. For the 2013 curves, Sheffield identified previously unconsidered sources of uncertainty in the reference data and developed new approaches to quantify and incorporate them **\[R6\]**. 

 The IWG crosses interdisciplinary boundaries and key to the construction of all the curves are the modelling and statistical analyses, by Sheffield researchers, which are required to combine the diverse data sets, each with their own specific attributes, into each of the IntCalXX, SHCalXX and MarineXX curves.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 All radiocarbon dating requires calibration to transform <sup>14</sup>C measurements into calendar ages. IntCal curves are the internationally agreed standard for the radiocarbon calibration \- everyone in the world who uses radiocarbon dating depends upon the IntCal curves to calibrate their radiocarbon dates. There are currently at least  [<ins>141</ins>](http://radiocarbon.webhost.uits.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/Labs-2019_Sep19.pdf),%20a) laboratories around the world with facilities for radiocarbon dating, all of which use IntCal13, SHCal13, and Marine13 calibrations \[S1\]. Published laboratory codes from 14 major labs indicate that over 120,000 samples were dated per year between 2013 and 2018. Of these, over 93% are calibrated using IntCal curves. There are currently no competitors to the curves provided by the IntCal Working Group and without curves the laboratory results are not interpretable as dates. At a cost of £350 per date this equates to over £42 million per annum generated for commercial laboratories. Without the curves the revenue generated for commercial laboratories by radiocarbon dating would be considerably lower. 

 The ability to obtain accurate and precise dating is fundamental, as it informs many of the economic and professional decisions relating to the protection, conservation, and understanding of the Historic Environment. As the global standard for radiocarbon dating, the IntCal curves provide a consistent chronology that enables accurate measurements and verification of findings across the globe. They provide validity and enable cross checking and comparison of dates and discoveries. IntCalXX delivers “ *robust, reliable, and readily comparable chronologies between, and within, projects*” **\[S1\].** 

 The President of Beta Analytic, the largest commercial radiocarbon laboratory in the world, describes the IntCal curves as “ *the recognized standard for radiocarbon age calibrations*” and recommends recent updates “ *as the primary \(and preferably only\) curves used for radiocarbon dating calibrations*” **\[S2\].** Time and monetary constraints would not otherwise allow for such robust statistical methodology and curve refinement within the commercial environment without the findings from the IWG **\[S2\]**. In addition, the frequent updates to the IntCal curves have generated improved understanding by allowing for over a million previously produced radiocarbon ages to be reviewed and updated, thus producing ‘new and exciting interpretations’ of historic events **\[S2\].** 

 Accurate and reliable radiocarbon dates calibrated with IntCal09 and IntCal13 have therefore had an impact in a wide range of different social and economic areas since 2013. The following examples have been chosen to demonstrate the variety of fields in which these dating methods are used, and the breadth of impacts that have affected a diverse range of beneficiaries. 

 Impact on global climate change policy 

 A precise understanding of our past climate is needed to understand, predict, and mitigate potential, current, and future changes. The IntCal curves enable the comparison of environmental records on radiocarbon timescales with other key independent timescales \(e.g. ice\-cores\). 

 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) is the United Nations body responsible for assessing climate change science. Used by policy makers to understand risks, and plan adaptations and mitigations, its reports are the most authoritative documents influencing understanding of international climate change. In September 2013, 259 experts from 39 countries published ‘Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis’, a comprehensive assessment of evidence of climate change. 80 publications cited in this assessment relied on the IntCal curves for their calendar dates **\[S3\]**. 

 This assessment formed the scientific basis for the 5<sup>th</sup> IPCC report \(published in 2014 and agreed by governments of all IPCC member countries\). This was described by the vice\-chair of the IPCC’s Working Group 3, which deals with measures to mitigate climate change, as “ *the most important report the IPCC has ever produced”* **\[S4\]** as it underpinned the United Nations climate talks in Paris in 2015. These talks led to the formation of the  [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement), the first\-ever universal, legally binding global climate change agreement, adopted December 2015 and formally ratified by the EU in October 2016 **\[S5\]**. 

 Regents’ Professor, Northern Arizona University, and lead author of Chapter 2 of the 6<sup>th</sup> IPCC report testifies that the IntCal curves have “ *been critical for providing a perspective on past climate \[…\] essential for our understanding of the climate system, and a baseline for modelling future changes*”. IntCal curves are “highly relevant” to policy development as they provide new understanding on the carbon cycle and the processes in the Earth’s climate system **\[S6\].** 

 Impact on developers and practitioners in the protection and appreciation of the historic environment 

 The IntCal curves provide a reliable, rigorous, international, industry\-wide standard that is vital to the commissioning and delivery of commercial archaeology **\[S1\].** The comparability and consistency provided by the IntCal curves, together with improvements in the precision and accuracy of these curves, ensures clear value for money for the construction and land development industry. This funds the great majority of archaeological investigation \(a market currently worth an estimated £200 million annually in England, and €2 billion annually across Europe\) **\[S1\].** 

 The Bayesian approach used to compile the IntCal curves allows integration with the standard use of Bayesian chronological modelling in the archaeological sector. Within the archaeological sector, calibrated radiocarbon dating, using the IntCal curves, is frequently a required step in the planning process when archaeological work is commissioned for new construction development including large\-scale projects **\[S1\]**. The National Head of Research at Historic England states that radiocarbon dating and calibration using the IntCal curves, in combination with Bayesian chronological modelling are “ *fundamental elements of archaeological specifications issued as part of the planning process*” **\[S1\]**. 

 Thus, the IntCal curves provide essential infrastructure that enables developers to commission archaeological work to standards that meet regulatory guidance in the UK and beyond **\[S1\].** 

 Increased public awareness in the historic environment 

 The Heritage Sector is an important economic sector. In England, in 2019, it directly provided £14.7 billion GVA and 206,000 jobs. Knowledge is critical to public enjoyment of the Historic Environment and is often underpinned by accurate radiocarbon dating. In England it provided new insights into the construction of Stonehenge. This knowledge has been incorporated into displays in the Stonehenge visitors’ centre and accompanying recreation of Neolithic houses, both opened in December 2013. IntCal09 enabled “ *novel insight*” that “ *fed directly into the presentation of the Stonehenge site*” **\[S1\].** 

 In China, IntCal13 provided evidence for the earliest water\-management site in Liangzhu City. IntCal13 calibrated dates were subsequently used in its application, and 2019 inscription, to UNESCO’s World Heritage List.  Having a site inscribed on the World Heritage List increases the prestige of the site and helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for the preservation of that site. This increased awareness facilitates a rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties. Countries can also apply for financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites. 

 The site provides new insights into Chinese history by ‘ *authentically and credibly demonstrating the degree of development of the rice\-cultivating civilization \[…\] in the Neolithic’* **\[S7\]**. Use of IntCal13 on artefacts from Liangzhu City provided scientific confirmation for the first time that ‘ *Chinese are the inheritors of a 5,000\-year\-old unbroken cultural tradition’* **\[S7\]**. These results are used in 2019\-20 Chinese history and mathematics textbooks, an act the president of the Chinese Archaeological Society states helped ‘ *foster a cultural confidence among young people’* and improved ‘ *their awareness of cultural protection and heritage’* **\[S7\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

  

 The Welfare Reform Act 2012 and subsequent introduction of Universal Credit \(UC\) is widely recognised as the most fundamental reform of the social security system since its inception. When fully implemented, UC will cover approximately 7,000,000 people in the UK. Research evidence and recommendations provided by Prof. Scullion into the impact of these reforms on marginalised populations \- including military veterans, migrants and disabled people \- have informed debate and achieved demonstrable policy and practice influence at national and international level. Specifically, recommendations directly influenced responses from the UK Government and devolved administrations as well as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development \(OECD\) to the implementation of social security. This resulted in a reduction in the waiting period for UC first payment \(from 6\+ weeks to 5 weeks\); the introduction of a benefit sanctions warning pilot; and a GBP5,000,000 UK Government investment to enhance its Armed Forces Champions network. Salford’s research also informed the development of the UK’s first ever *Veterans’ Strategy* and Ministry of Defence *Holistic Transition Policy*. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prof. Scullion has played an instrumental role in two significant projects that have directly impacted on social security policy and practice: \(1\) *Welfare Conditionality: Sanctions, Support and Behaviour Change \[WelCond\]* \(2013 – 2018\); and \(2\) *Sanctions, Support & Service Leavers* *\[SSSL\]* \(2017 – 2019\). 

 **WelCond** project 2013 – 2018** 

 The *WelCond* project involved 13 researchers, two support staff and eight PhD students, across six universities: Glasgow \(Co\-I Prof. Wright\), Heriot\-Watt \(Co\-Is Prof. Fitzpatrick/Prof. Johnsen\), Salford \(Co\-I Prof. Scullion\), Sheffield \(Co\-I Prof. Flint\), Sheffield Hallam \(Co\-I Prof. Fletcher\), and York \(PI Prof. Dwyer\). *WelCond* created an international interdisciplinary focal point for research on welfare conditionality **\[3.1\]**. Three linked elements of qualitative fieldwork underpinned the research and generated extensive original data: 54 semi\-structured interviews with policy stakeholders; 27 focus groups with frontline welfare practitioners; and an innovative repeat, qualitative longitudinal panel study \( *the largest ever project of its kind*\). This panel study was undertaken with welfare service users across a range of policy areas and target groups who were interviewed up to three times over a two\-year period \(Wave A, n=481; total interviews=1,082\) in 11 locations in England and Scotland **\[3.1\]**. 

 Prof. Scullion contributed specifically to research/analysis focusing on the policy areas of migration **\[3.2, 3.3\]** and disability **\[3.4\]**, as well as to the Universal Credit \(UC\) research within the project. The findings **\[3.1 – 3.4\]** highlighted significant concerns in relation to: 

-  The ineffectiveness of welfare conditionality in facilitating movements off social security benefits and into the paid labour market 

-  The extreme financial hardship, worsened mental and physical health and negative behavioural outcomes triggered by benefit sanctions 

-  Deficiencies and inconsistencies in the mandatory support provided by DWP 

-  The impact of reforms on vulnerable and marginalised groups within this system. 

 *WelCond* recommended a fundamental review of the conditionality system; an immediate end to the sanctioning of disabled and vulnerable people; and a rebalancing of the social security system towards providing appropriate and meaningful support and away from applying sanctions. 

 **SSSL** project 2017 – 2019** 

 Building on the *WelCond* project, Prof. Scullion led the development of the *SSSL* project in collaboration with the University of York \(Co\-I Prof. Dwyer\). This project represented *the UK’s first ever research* to focus on veterans’ experiences of the social security system **\[3.5\]**. Two linked elements of qualitative fieldwork underpinned the research, generating further original data: 20 semi\-structured interviews with policy stakeholders; and qualitative longitudinal research with veterans \(Wave A n=68; total interviews=120\). The Department for Work and Pensions \(DWP\), as a government department, has made commitments to the Armed Forces Covenant, which aims to ensure that veterans do not experience disadvantage when accessing public services. However, the findings raised significant concerns around inconsistencies in the DWP support provided to veterans; the lack of understanding of Service\-related impairments by Work Coaches and benefits assessors; and the difficulties faced by veterans who are being moved to UC. *SSSL* made a series of recommendations **\[3.5\]**, including: 

-  Jobcentre Plus \(JCP\) offices should have at least one designated individual who takes a leading role in supporting military veterans 

-  The DWP to undertake a comprehensive review of the Armed Forces Champion role 

-  The needs of veterans should be tracked by consistent recording procedures within the DWP 

-  The provision of enhanced support to veterans, particularly in the transition from legacy benefits to UC.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 It is widely acknowledged that the welfare reforms of the last decade have had a negative impact on some of the most vulnerable members of society. The introduction of Universal Credit \(UC\) in 2013 marked a fundamental reform in the social security system and at full scale will serve approximately  [7,000,000 people in the UK](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/12/14/dwps-agile-response-to-covid-19-scaling-universal-credit-to-meet-demand/). Given the large number of claimants, it is imperative that the impact of the reforms is evidenced through research. The *WelCond* and *SSSL* projects have been at the forefront of this evidence base and have directly influenced social security policy and practice in the following significant ways: 

 **WelCond** project 2013 – 2018** 

 As Salford Co\-I Prof. Scullion was part of the project management team and was involved in all aspects of delivery, including data collection and analysis, report writing, dissemination as well as policy briefings and presentations to Ministers, with particular focus on the policy areas of migration and disability, as well as UC **\[3.1 \- 3.4\]**. Overall, *WelCond* generated **331 engagement activities**, **166 publications** and **94 influences on policy and practice** **\[5.1\]**. Details of the key impacts are outlined as follows: 

 <ins> **Changes to the</ins> <ins>benefit</ins> <ins>sanctions regime**</ins> 

-  In October 2015, as a direct result of our findings, the <ins> **DWP</ins> introduced a** **benefit sanctions early warning pilot** **\[5.2\]**. This gives benefit claimants warning of the intention to sanction and provides them with sufficient time to evidence why they were unable to meet the conditions of their claim. 

-  Between 2015 and 2018 Prof. Scullion’s input into written evidence submissions have **directly informed and been widely cited in the reports of seven Westminster or UK level inquiries:** Work & Pensions Committee \(W&PC\) 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018; Public Accounts Committee \(PAC\) 2018; Social Security Advisory Committee \(SSAC\) 2016; Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee \(ELGCC\), National Assembly for Wales \(2017\) **\[5.2\]**. 

-  In 2018, drawing on *WelCond* evidence and subsequent recommendations **\[3.1, 3.4\]**, the W&PC inquiry report \(pp. 30\-34 and 38\-40\) called for **disabled people to be exempted from conditionality and sanctions**, with the Chair of the W&PC Select Committee confirming that *‘there was no evidence that conditionality contributed to improving employment outcomes for disabled people’* and concluding that *‘the government would be unwise to press ahead with in\-work conditionality in the absence of any evidence of its effectiveness’* **\[5.2\]**. 

-  Some 20 organisations cited our findings in their submissions to the 2018 W&PC inquiry, including <ins>Disability Rights UK</ins>, the <ins>Equalities and Human Rights Commission</ins>, the <ins>Joseph Rowntree Foundation</ins> and the <ins>Scottish Government</ins> **\[5.2\]**. 

 <ins> **Changes to the implementation of UC**</ins> 

-  The 2016 W&PC *‘UC in\-work progression in Universal Credit’* report cited our evidence on nine occasions. Based on our recommendations, new measures were brought in by the Government around **additional training for Work Coaches** and expediting the publication of sanctions and research trial data **\[5.2\]**. 

-  Between 2017 and 2018, our findings **\[3.1\]** were cited in four Westminster debates on UC, specifically by Patrick Grady MP, Neil Gray MP and Debbie Abrahams MP **\[5.3\]**. Based on our recommendations, **four significant changes to UC were announced by the UK Government**, namely: reducing the waiting period for first payment \(from 6\+ to 5 weeks\); increasing advances for new claimants; offering advances to claimants sooner; and extending loan recovery times **\[5.2\]**. 

 <ins> **Direct influence on approaches of devolved administrations**</ins> 

-  In September 2016, following the publication of our First Wave Findings, a motion to the <ins>Scottish Parliament</ins> triggered a parliamentary debate, initiated by the convenor of the Social Security Committee and focusing specifically on our findings **\[5.4\]**. The Minister for Employability and Training concluded the debate by confirming that our research had *‘helped to shape our \[Scottish Government\] thinking’* and *‘provides clear evidence that \[…\] the current UK Government’s benefit conditionality and sanctions regime causes suffering’* **\[5.4\]**. The <ins>Scottish Government</ins> consequently explored ways to mitigate the effects of sanctions so that its new employment support programmes did not form part of the UK Government’s sanctions regime **\[5.4\]** and has subsequently **used its devolved powers to end compulsion and sanctions**. 

-  In September 2017, Prof. Scullion \(along with Prof. Wright, Glasgow\) gave oral evidence to the <ins>National Assembly for Wales</ins>’ Equalities, Local Government and Communities Committee inquiry on *Making the Economy Work for People on Low Incomes*. The Committee Chair confirmed in a letter that *‘As a direct result of the evidence \[Drs Wright and Scullion\] gave, we wrote to the UK Government outlining our concerns about a number of elements about the implementation of Universal Credit’* **\[5.4\]** and **called for a pause in the rollout of UC** until the problems identified by our research had been addressed. The Chair also confirmed that he had *‘no doubt that \[…\] we will again seek to draw on the excellent work of the Welfare Conditionality project’*, as the National Assembly for Wales develops future policy **\[5.4\]**. 

 <ins> **International re</ins><ins>cognition**</ins> 

-  In 2018, Prof. Scullion \(along with Prof. Wright, Glasgow\) presented *WelCond* UC findings to <ins>OECD</ins> senior staff in Paris. One OECD Economist stated that this presentation had *‘challenged the views of a number of OECD labour market experts’* and provided *‘invaluable input into the upcoming OECD Economic Survey of the United Kingdom, which aims to provide a balanced assessment of the Universal Credit system’* **\[5.5\]**. 

-  In 2018, following written and in person submissions, both the *WelCond* and *SSSL* outputs **\[3.1, 3.5\]** were cited in the final report of the <ins>UN Special Rapporteur</ins>’s Inquiry into Extreme Poverty and Human Rights in the UK. The Rapporteur noted *WelCond*’s evidence *‘was very valuable in terms of helping me to hone my understanding of the system further and confirming the views that I had been able to form’* **\[5.6\]**. The UN report **adopted the **WelCond** recommendations for an independent review of sanctions** and the need to rebalance the social security system towards support **\[3.1\]**. 

 **SSSL** project 2017 – 2019** 

 The *SSSL* project, led by Prof. Scullion **\[3.5\]**, has had significant influence across the <ins>UK</ins> <ins>G</ins><ins>overnment’s</ins> <ins>DWP</ins> and <ins>M</ins><ins>inistry of Defence \(M</ins><ins>oD</ins><ins>\)</ins> and received the annual FiMT Research Award 2020 in recognition of its ‘ *significant impact’* **\[5.7\]**. Specifically, the project has contributed as follows: 

 <ins> **MoD/DWP develop benefits guidance for Service Leavers**</ins> 

-  In 2018, in response to our interim findings and recommendations, the MoD and DWP committed to working collaboratively to provide **consistent guidance on the benefits system on MoD bases** as part of Service Leaver support **\[5.8\]**. 

-  In 2019, in response to our final recommendations **\[3.5\]**, the MoD committed to production of a **dedicated benefits guidance pack for Service Leavers** **\[5.8\]**. 

-  In 2019 *, SSSL* findings were **used within the MoD Joint Service Publication \(JSP\) 100**, which is the authoritative document for tri\-Service holistic transition policy and procedures **\[5.9, pp. 2\-3\]**. 

-  In 2019, our research was **directly cited in a House of Commons Defence debate on veterans** and their negative experience of UC **\[5.10\]**. 

  

 <ins> **Direct contribution to UK’s first ever Veterans’ Strategy**</ins> 

-  In 2018, following the publication of the *SSSL* interim findings, Prof. Scullion was asked to join the MoD *Veterans’ Strategy Academic Advisory Group* and contributed directly to the **development of the UK Government’s first ever**  [**Strategy for our Veterans**](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategy-for-our-veterans) by providing comments on drafts of the Strategy and specific input in relation to social security to inform the revised Strategy, as confirmed by the Ministry of Defence Armed Forces Covenant Team **\[5.11\]**. 

 <ins> **I</ins><ins>nvestment to increase the DWP Armed Forces Champions network**</ins> 

-  With reference to impact on DWP policy and practice, a **GBP5,000,000 investment from the UK Government in the 2019 Spending Review** is directly attributed to Prof. Scullion’s work: the Armed Forces Lead \(DWP\) confirmed that the research *‘certainly caused the department to have a very close look at the way it supported veterans, and provided a well\-researched evidence base to make some changes to the way we delivered that support’* **\[5.12\]**. The money was used to **increase the number of DWP Armed Forces Champions within UK Jobcentres**, along with appropriate training and job description for that role, to ensure consistent support to veterans **\[5.12\]**. This was a recommendation of the *SSSL* project **\[3.5\]** and represents a significant investment, particularly in the context of austerity. 

-  On 10 November 2020, Prof. Scullion met with the Minister for Welfare Delivery to **brief him on the findings and recommendations of the **SSSL** project**, following which he confirmed in a letter that *‘your report has provided us with some really useful insight into veterans’ experience of the benefits system’* **\[5.13\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 An innovative method for estimating extreme quantiles of multiple random variables was developed at the LSE in collaboration with investment bank Barclays. Its application to the management of the tens of billions of US\-dollars’ worth of counterparty risk\-weighted assets \(RWA\) held by Barclays has helped the bank meet the requirements of Basel III. Specifically, a new methodology for future counterparty RWA evaluation, in which the extreme quantile estimation method plays a key role, has enabled the bank to calculate an appropriate capital reserve to protect customers’ interests as well as its own business in an effective and efficient manner, avoiding holding excessively large additional capital. This reduces the cost of borrowing and contributes positively to investment and economic growth. Barclays’ new methodology for future counterpart RWA evaluation has withstood backtesting under the Basel III framework since its inception in November 2013. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning impacts described here arose in the context of an ongoing research programme within LSE’s Department of Statistics on statistical inference for time series and complex dependent data. The specific underpinning research \(published in **\[1\]**\) was directly motivated by a backtesting problem in financial risk management. Between January 2012 and January 2014, Professor Qiwei Yao \(with Dr Jinguo Gong, at that time a visiting scholar at LSE\) worked with the then\-Director of Quantitative Exposure at Barclays to develop an improved backtesting methodology for the bank. They particularly sought to establish a more reliable and robust method to estimate potential future exposure to counterparty credit risk. Yao was invited to join the project on the basis of his established expertise in relevant areas of statistical analysis, especially in time series and dependent data \(see, for example, **\[2\]**\). 

 Backtesting is a primary analytical tool used by banks and their regulators to monitor the performance of risk factor valuation methods adopted by banks. It uses historical data showing realised prices to \(back\)test the efficacy of existing risk factor models. This is often facilitated by testing whether the extreme quantiles of potential future exposure \(PFE\) under those models are correctly quantified. PFE refers to the maximum expected credit exposure during the lifetime of transactions with a prespecified probability. It is a key metric to measure counterparty credit risk \(CCR\) \- the risk of suffering a loss because another party to a contract fails to meet its side of the deal. 

 The figure below provides a simple illustration of the backtesting setup for a price model of a term structure asset; that is, an asset which can be traded with different time maturities at different prices. Herein, a realised price path \(i.e. the actually traded prices at different maturities\) is represented by X<sub>1,</sub> X<sub>2,</sub> …, X<sub>p</sub> and the solid curves represent the price distributions at different time maturities determined by a price model. 



 Backtesting is a method for assessing whether the realised price path is an extreme event with very small probability, say, 0.01%, under those price distributions. If so, this would strongly suggest a mis\-specified price model and a “red light” would be designated. Two complicating factors make backtesting difficult: 

1.  the interdependency of prices at different time horizons; and 

1.  the explicit unavailability of price distributions. 

 Although the distributions are not available, banks store 1,000 *simulated* price paths as a proxy for them, allowing backtesting based on a comparison of these with a realised price path. \(Note that due to various constraints most banks, including Barclays, can *only* store 1,000 simulated price paths.\) Typically, banks take *ad hoc* approaches to calculating extreme PFE quantiles. Usually this involves raising the PFE profile according to the number of prices exceeding, say, the 98% PFE at each time horizon; raising the PFE at different time horizons together in order to offset the correlations/associations among the prices at different time horizons; and using simulation models which impose various unrealistic conditions. Those *ad hoc* approaches cannot be justified theoretically, leading to incorrect and sometimes excessively conservative estimation. 

 A sensible approach to mitigating the difficulties caused by the multiple distributions along different time horizons is to use some appropriate risk metrics which are function of X<sub>1,</sub> X<sub>2,</sub> …, X<sub>p</sub><sub>.</sub> The challenge, then, is accurately finding the extreme quantiles of those risk metrics with only 1,000 observations, because those quantiles have to be so extreme that they can only occur with probability between 0.05% and 0.01%. The standard approach to achieving this is to appeal to extreme value theory \(EVT\). Unfortunately, this involves the selection of tuning parameters such as the proportion of extreme\-valued data points to be used in estimation. While the asymptotic properties of the tuning parameters are well understood, the methods to choose them in practice are *ad hoc*; leading to estimates which are too unreliable to be used in evaluating extreme PFE. 

 In late 2013, in collaboration with Barclays QA Exposure Analytics team, Yao began to tackle the challenge of estimating extreme PFE quantiles based on the small available samples of just 1,000 simulated price paths. The new method developed takes advantage of the fact that the extreme quantiles required are determined by multiple random variables \(i.e. X<sub>1,</sub> X<sub>2,</sub> …, X<sub>p</sub>\). The key idea here is that it is not necessary to go to extremes along any component variable in order to observe the joint extreme events. A risk metric can therefore fall into the region of extreme values without any of X<sub>1,</sub> X<sub>2,</sub> …, X<sub>p</sub> actually taking extreme values. This seemingly counter\-intuitive observation is central to the success of the new approach which, despite being readily demonstrable, had never previously been explored in either extreme value inference literature or in practice. 

 The resulting method, described in **\[1\]**, provides a satisfactory solution to quantify the extreme quantiles of PFE accurately and reliably. The method is conceptually simple, easy to implement, and involves no tuning parameters. It provides robust performance in practice. Based on the key observation above, the new method fits a joint distribution of multiple random variables X<sub>1,</sub> X<sub>2,</sub> …, X<sub>p</sub> within their observed range based on a vine\-copula structure which captures the term structure in the data. It then draws a large bootstrap sample from the fitted joint distribution and uses the sample \(extreme\) quantiles as the estimates for the required quantiles. \(Note that the bootstrap sample space from a sample of size n of p\-variables is in the order of n to the p\-th power\). This new method is backed up by appropriate asymptotic theory \(see **\[1\]**\). 

 Yao was the main creator of the new methodology. Gong conducted the numerical experiments. Their partner at Barclays provided the background, contributed to the development of the methodology, and was responsible for the case study reported in **\[1\]**. Liang Peng \(Professor of Risk Management and Insurance at Georgia State University\) was brought in at a later stage to provide the expertise on EVT required for establishing the asymptotic theory for publication **\[1\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Basel III framework is an internationally agreed set of measures intended to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of banks, in response to weaknesses exposed by the financial crisis of 2007\-2009. It requires banks and other financial institutions to apply a backtesting procedure to various market risk factors, trade, and portfolio prices. 

 **The challenges of managing counterparty credit risk:** one of the requirements of Basel III is enhanced management of counterparty credit risk \(CCR\) **\[A\]**. This makes CCR backtesting a mandatory requirement for all banks with advanced model approval for CCR, including Barclays. Basel III also requires investment banks to hold adequate capital and liquidity to cover the CCR, which is the potential loss in derivative positions due to the default of trading counterparties. The reason for this strong emphasis on banks’ proper management of CCR is that it is important to the stability not only of individual banks but also, in light of the interconnections between them, to the financial system as a whole. The failures of Lehman Brothers and MF Global, and their impacts on the global financial system, illustrate the disruptive potential of instability in any part of the system. 

 However, CCR is a complex risk to assess; as a hybrid of credit and market risk, it is contingent both on changes in the counterparty’s creditworthiness and on movements in underlying market risk factors. The first step in computing CCR capital is typically to jointly simulate various future market risk factors such as interest rates, equities, and foreign exchange rates. Next, all the derivative positions of the bank are computed at each time horizon of each of these simulated market scenarios, to determine the bank’s potential future exposure \(PFE\) to counterparty default. The amount of holding capital required to cover CCR is then calculated, based on PFE and according to the relevant regulation. 

 **The role of backtesting:** backtesting is a critical component of the Basel III regulation, particularly as a means of assessing the extreme PFE quantiles used by banks and financial institutions to validate price models and to calculate their credit holding. The *ad hoc* approaches typically taken to calculating these extreme quantiles are inaccurate. Underestimating the extreme quantiles leads to the exposure of both banks and their customers to potential uncovered financial losses. Conservative estimation leads to additional unnecessary overheads and, consequently, to increases in the costs of borrowing and decreases in investment. 

 **Implementing the new backtesting method at Barclays:** Barclays work with Yao on the development of the new method for estimating extreme quantiles published in **\[1\]** has changed and improved important aspects of their approach to backtesting. Specifically, the new method has helped Barclays to: 

 *“overcome the difficult technical challenges associated with backtesting uncollateralised portfolio…This allows Barclays to backtest the potential future exposure to counterparty default based on a theoretically sound method for the very first time.”* **\[B\]** 

 That new method “ *has been used as the official production method to backtest Barclays’ CCR exposure RWA* \[risk weighted assets\] *since November 2013”* **\[B**, further confirmed in **C\]**. As a result, it is now “ *one of the key components for backtesting our large CCR RWA for uncollateralised portfolio day\-to\-day”* **\[B**, further confirmed in **C\]**. 

 **Reducing the cost of borrowing by more accurately calculating an appropriate capital buffer:** Barclays holds CCR RWA worth tens of billions of US dollars \(commercial sensitivity prevents Barclays from releasing the exact figure\). The new methodology is applied across that portfolio, allowing the bank to calculate an adequate capital buffer to protect both its own and its customers’ interests by avoiding the need to hold excessively large additional capital. The direct saving from this new scientifically calculated buffer is substantial. This, in turn, also reduces the cost of borrowing, and potentially increases investment and economic growth, with substantial indirect benefits to society. 

 **Helping Barclays to meet regulatory requirements and improve its CCR management:** since its first use by Barclays in late 2013, the new method has withstood rigorous backtesting under the Basel III framework. The Managing Director and Head of Cross Product Modelling of Barclays explains: 

 *“The new methodology has helped Barclays to meet \[the\] regulator’s requirements and better manage and control our counterparty risk…\[because it\] has helped Barclays to demonstrate quantitatively that we hold an adequate amount of capital to manage our counterparty credit risk.”* **\[B\]** 

 This has helped to ensure that both Barclays and its customers have avoided exposure to highly risky positions. Had its backtesting failed, the bank would have been required to re\-adjust its CCR RWA evaluation by increasing its estimates of CCR exposure. That increase would, in turn, demand that they hold additional capital add\-ons, a requirement that would be extremely costly given the large size of the bank’s counterparty RWA. Commercial confidentiality also prevents Barclays from releasing its backtesting methodology documentation or related quantitative backtesting results. However, the bank’s Head of Cross Product Modelling writes: 

 *“I am happy to provide this letter to recognise Professor Yao’s contribution to our CCR backtesting methodology, which has helped Barclays to improve our Counterparty Credit Risk management.”* **\[B\]**. 

 **Wider benefits of improved CCR management:** the proper management of exposure to CCR based on the new method underpinned by **\[1\]** delivers several important benefits. 

1.  First, it improves the overall stability of Barclays in the sense that both its customers’ and the bank’s own interests are protected by alleviating exposure to uncovered high risky positions within a small probability \(such as 0.05% or 0.01%\). 

1.  Secondly, it contributes to the stability of the global financial system as a whole by mitigating the potential impact of the failure of one bank on others. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 underscored the need for better protections of this sort within a highly interconnected global financial system. 

1.  Thirdly, it increases the bank’s confidence in lending via a reduction of the cost of borrowing. This results from the fact that calculating the extreme PFE based on the new method helps the bank more accurately estimate an adequate capital buffer. In other words, the method allows banks to cover a given degree of risk with a smaller capital requirement. Given that Barclays holds CCR RWA worth tens of billions of US dollars, the direct saving from this new and scientifically calculated buffer is substantial. This substantial saving improves the bank’s business and operations and encourages more investment. 

 Yao’s innovative contribution in estimating extreme PFE quantiles is an indispensable part of the new backtesting method directly supporting these benefits. As such, the research has contributed indirectly to assuring greater financial system security at lower cost, with wider economic benefits.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* *\(SAWS\)* \[3.1\] furthers a long\-term investigation of the essential co\-presence of performers and audience within the basic material realities of theatrical performance. Created with local participants rather than trained performers, the work foregrounds the performance of everyday life and lives, through dramaturgies of interview, inquiry and instruction. It engages the tensions between an apparatus of representation and the structured presentation of participants’ daily lives, to interrogate and renegotiate the boundaries between conventions of performer and spectator participation. 

 The research explored how a theatrical apparatus might invite an audience to both join and influence the process of construction being revealed to them. It examined two key concepts: firstly, to what extent could our working methodology stimulate recognition of and engagement with scenographic objects as actants within performance; and second, what effect might the reconfiguration of a work’s theatrical frames have upon the audience’s experience of that which is presented. 

 <ins>Working with non\-professional performers has become an established trope of post dramatic performance, yet the particular focus of this research has made an original and distinctive contribution to this field by focusing on how theatre as an apparatus of representation codifies and conditions the appearance of ‘the people’ whom it presents as simply ‘present’.</ins> 

 *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* enabled audiences to encounter high quality artistic practice in which ordinary people present themselves and aspects of their personal daily realities, rather than being represented either by or as actors. In acknowledging the recognition and validation of ‘self’ as a core mechanism of theatre, here the mechanics of presentation, representation and presence are demystified in an attempt to find and allow perhaps more egalitarian modes of participation \[3.2\]. 

 This research was rooted within the ongoing collaborative artistic practice that Banham has been engaged in with his company Quarantine for the past 20 years. This practice\-based research into a relational aesthetic and practice within the scenographic and dramaturgical composition of contemporary theatre underpins all his work. It is further contextualised and informed by the practice\-based scholarly research on located theatre practices and the performance of place undertaken by departmental colleagues and collaborators. Banham, along with Mike Brookes, has played a leading role in the development of practice\-based research within the Department of Theatre Film and Television Studies through the *Scenography, Performance and the Everyday* research cluster. Their practical investigations as solo artists and in collaboration are attested in scholarly literature in the field, as well as through conference presentations and guest seminars. 

 The wider resulting body of public performance work produced by Quarantine has made a significant contribution to debates within contemporary theatre practices internationally. The durational work *Wallflower* \(2015–present\) is detailed within this REF submission. *Wallflower* \[3.3\] *,* which was created in tandem with *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* echoes the research investigation into the portrayal of ‘self’ through embodied acts of remembering \(‘every dance you’ve ever danced’\), and is currently staged as a 90 minute, 5 hour or 12 hour version with each extension in duration interrogating the invitation to the spectator to participate in the creation of a shared experience.

 ‘Through a series of extraordinary productions, including the extraordinary S.A.W.S. Quartet, Quarantine have affected the way we think about the process of theatre making and changed our expectations of who will appear on stage’ – Artistic Director, Manchester International Festival \(2019\) 

 Through exploring new perspectives and approaches to audience engagement within theatre, *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* has had significant impact both on public imagination and on subsequent practices and possibilities within the industry. Its approaches have been integral to key consequential commissions, most notably the creation of a major site\-specific participatory event for the Manchester International Festival \(MIF\) in 2017. *What is the City but the People?* \[3.5\], a one\-off public opening event for MIF17, was live streamed by the BBC and structured the presentation of a curated selection of Manchester residents on a purpose\-built 66m\-long catwalk constructed within the city’s centre, engaging local residents as both its subject and cast, and proposing a consciously theatrical and presentational frame that sought to enable an exploration of the presentation of self within a representation of the city. 

 <ins>The arc of this embodied research has raised critical awareness of new areas of dramaturgy and scenography and, in turn, has led to a broadening of the horizons of contemporary theatre and to a rethinking of conventional production and creation practices within two main areas:</ins> 

####  **Cultural life – in enriching public appreciation and knowledge of the theatrical form by generating new forms of artistic expression** 

 *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* enabled audiences to engage with scenographic environments and participative dramaturgies in a relational frame, shifting the focus and perspective away from direct artistic appreciations of composition to favour an experience of the aesthetic event from within. It encouraged audiences and communities to imagine and present themselves as participants in artistic practices of representation. Total audience figures reached 7,366. As shown both by the testimony of those who participated and the feedback from the audience, the production provoked new ideas and stimulated considerable debate on these fundamental aspects of contemporary theatre. Participants considered it ‘thought\-provoking’, ‘original’ and ‘different from anything I’ve experienced before’, noting how the work had demonstrated that theatre ‘doesn’t always have to be conventional’. Others deemed the production ‘a uniquely human theatre production’, ‘out of the box art’ and ‘\[t\]he art of participation and relational dynamics at it's very best…. real people at the heart/front\-centre of this conversation’. One participant commented on how the production had *‘*stimulated interesting thoughts and conversation. I found the venue and production design aided the concepts raised by the pieces as you did not seek to hide the studios features – all was laid bare for us as an audience’. Another noted how it felt ‘like you're representing people’. Audience members noted how the work was ‘unique’ and ‘unexpected’. One noted how the work had proved ‘inspiring… I feel I have been part of … a theatrical experience I will never forget’ \[5.1\]. 

 *What is the City but the People?* also attracted large audiences and secured international reach \(approximately 6,000 attended the event, 10,000 watched it live online\). The work evoked similar reactions to *SAWS*, with participants commenting on how ‘wonderful’ it was to be part of the production and how it made them ‘feel more connected with the city’ \[5.2\]. The production was voted ‘Best Event’ at the 2018 Manchester Culture Awards. 

 Initial productions of *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* were widely covered in the national press, on television and radio, and were extensively reviewed. A BBC live steam of *What is the City but the People?* is still available on BBC iPlayer and continues to be viewed \[5.3\]. According to one review in *The Guardian* ‘\[Summer\] exudes warmth, and a valuably impolite yet delicate and searching curiosity about what it is that makes us human…. We all perform our own lives, like actors on a stage playing roles’ \[5.4\]. Similarly, the BBC described *What is the City but the People?* as ‘beautiful’ and ‘life\-affirming’ \[5.5\] and a review in *The Telegraph* deemed the production ‘lump\-in\-the\-throat\- *moving’* \[5.6\]. 

####  **Professional practice – in informing programming and in generating new ways of thinking that influence contemporary production practices** 

 The exploratory approaches underpinning *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* required new organisational structures and production priorities to be developed in collaboration with each producing context, to conceive and implement production procedures that would allow and support the intended modes of integration and engagement of local participants and audiences within the work’s creation and performance. 

 The specific nature and structure of the quartet of distinct works that formed *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* demanded a different working relationship to be agreed and planned with festivals and promoters producing the work, opening up new ways of embedded locational working practices appropriate to the context and local constituents being engaged. 

 This is evidenced in the Arts Council England’s Artistic and Quality Assessment Form: 

 ‘The flexibility of the cycle’s structure and sophisticated use of simple elements \(instructions, questions, answers\) sets it up well to adapt over time and respond to each location it’s presented in, keeping its commitment to a piece of mass portraiture … relevant. Additionally, the incorporation of local residents as participants invites people into an art form … with the potential to broaden their perception of what art and performance is \(and can be\), as this piece champions a different kind of spectacle and entertainment than offered in more mainstream venues, companies and art forms. The focus on the domestic and everyday and use of familiar tropes … makes the piece approachable and accessible…. this balance between audiences, the conventions of participatory practice, and artistic vision is a great example of best practice in combined arts’ \[5.7\]. 

 The Artistic Director of the MIF also noted how ‘In \[Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring\] daily life was transformed … through the focus that the design and staging brought to a group of ordinary individuals onstage’. This approach was successfully applied to *What is the City but the People?* – integrating project\-specific modes of production and production design within the artistic intentions and realisation of the work, in ways that might both engage and reveal the daily realities of its context. ‘\[The event\] highlighted the extraordinary nature of each ‘ordinary’ individual presented in the work. Simon’s eye for detail and beauty teaches us to see daily life in a new way – revealing a profound aesthetic not only in the work he makes, but, subsequently, in everything we see’ \[5.8\]. 

 The international visibility and influence of these approaches is further evidenced by the subsequent recommissioning of *What is the City but the People?* – firstly as the opening event of the *Uitfeest* in Utrecht \(September 2018\), and secondly as the opening event of the *Ruhrfestspiel* in Recklinghausen, Germany \(May 2019\). The Artistic Director of the *Uitfeest* noted how the production had: 

 ‘showed the richness of the people of our city. It demonstrated its diversity in a most generous way. Several thousand people watched this parade of citizens of the city. In times of populism and nationalism this project made a gentle and strong statement, which was also recognized by city officials and funders’ \[5.9\]. 

 *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* also opened up new vistas in terms of programming choices. Quarantine was invited to create a new stage work for the inaugural season of the National Theatre Wales’ then Artistic Director in 2018 – as part of a season of work intended to draw on the production’s model of theatrical presentation, production and participation. Intentions made apparent by her statement that *Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring* had influenced her thinking, most specifically in the ways the event had: 

 ‘played with the dynamic between performer and spectator, between professional and non\-professional, between what is perceived as 'ordinary' and 'extraordinary' …, exploring and questioning the very nature of what theatre is, who makes it and how it is made’ \[5.10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A collective body of research by the History unit on seminal figures and events in Scottish history generated a range of impacts on cultural institutions and public understanding. The research charted the afterlives of William Wallace, Robert Burns, and the Union of 1707. It has benefited curatorial interpretation in national museums, and it has been widely used by heritage groups and media to inform diverse local, national and international audiences. The impacts were achieved through partnerships with cultural organisations, public engagement, and the high media profile of the research. The impacts are significant in bringing contested academic histories of Scotland to bear on wider understanding.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research by Morton and Whatley addressed Wallace, Burns, and the Union in the context of Scotland’s modern historical identity. Their work on Wallace and Burns demonstrated that iterative portrayals of these two iconic figures of Scotland’s ‘national tale’ had added layers of interpretation upon pre\-existing unionist and nationalist narratives. Whatley’s research used fresh evidence to explain how the Union had framed political nationalism over three hundred years. All of this research, presented mainly in three major monographs, challenged conventional wisdom about the ‘national tale’. 

 A key conclusion from the underpinning research was that the Union agreement was not reached through bribery. In *The Scots and the Union* \(2006, 2007\), Whatley revised the view that financial self\-interest and bribery lay behind the Articles of Union being settled. Rooted in a collective biography of Scots politicians and others of influence, Whatley established that many of those political actors had held long\-standing and principled support for political union, some since the Revolution of 1688/9. By undermining the popular refrain from Burns that the Scots had been ‘bought and sold for English gold’ the research dismissed the grounds upon which contemporary commentators have maintained the Union was misbegotten and therefore illegitimate. This challenge to conventional wisdom was recognised by the award of the Saltire Society’s History Book of the Year in 2007 and led one reviewer to conclude it ‘sets the agenda for discussions of the Union then, and the Union now’ \( *Scottish Historical Review*, 87 \(2008\): 345\). In 2014, the research was extended to examine how the Union settlement informs contemporary national identity \[R1\]. It was demonstrated that the modern nationalist movement in Scotland has made infrequent use of the nation’s history—in comparison with examples from Europe—because key carriers of national identity remained compatible with Union. Whatley further established that Jacobitism could not adequately replace the trope of bribery in nationalist history. Instead, the research concluded that for a ‘usable nationalist history’ to inform the Referendum vote in 2014, it should be one framed by the Union, not formed solely in opposition to the Union. 

 The conclusions reached in **R1** added to research that reassessed two central but equivocal historical figures: the national patriot William Wallace \(d.1305\) and national bard Robert Burns \(1759\-96\). Both figures have encapsulated national identity through the commemoration and memorialisation of their lives: more monuments were built to honour Wallace in nineteenth\-century Scotland than any other figure, and more monuments were built to honour Burns around the world than for any other poet. A survey run in 1999 by *Who’s Who* voted Burns and Wallace the two ‘greatest Scots’ in history \( *Scotsman*, 18/12/99\). The research was conceptualised through the ‘national tale’, a term taken out of its literary moorings to examine how personal biography has been reforged as the nation’s biography over long periods of time **\[R4\]**. Morton found that modern Scots traced the origins of their civil and national liberties to Wallace, Bruce and the medieval wars of independence. He analysed every statue and monument built to honour Wallace as points where social memory is privileged and shared within the community. He correlated these sites with a survey of natural formations located across lowland Scotland named after Wallace. By then charting the changing literary and visual media that transmitted the national tale, he discovered how Jane Porter’s best\-selling *Scottish Chiefs* \(1810\) placed Wallace as Scotland’s contribution to contemporary British national identity. This analysis reconceptualised the national tale within British constitutionalism rather than Jacobite romance **\[R5\]**. Morton challenged conventional wisdom that Wallace was solely a separatist hero. His evidence proved that Wallace underpinned both unionist and nationalist histories in contemporary Scotland, including throughout the political response to *Braveheart* \(1995\) and *Brave* \(2012\). The research explained how the transfiguration of historical heroes into national symbols allowed for national identity in Scotland to encompass complex and at times contradictory interpretations of the Union to coexist **\[R6\]**. 

 Linking this research into profoundly equivocal heroes was an investigation into a previously unstudied aspect of memory fixing \( *lieu de memoire*\), which revealed major shifts over time in how and why Burns was remembered and commemorated **\[R2\]**. Whatley demonstrated that Burns’ legacy in Scottish society in the long period after his death was widespread and deeply entrenched. The research was supported by an AHRC project ‘Robert Burns: Inventing Tradition and Securing Memory’ \(PI. Murray Pittock, Glasgow\) from which Whatley created a database of all the known memorials produced on Burns. The major conclusion was that the commemoration of Burns was much wider and more pervasive that had been hitherto understood. Beyond the theatre of the Burns supper, the wider social memory of Burns was sustained by his national tale being invoked at all kinds of community\-based gatherings in Scotland and across the Scottish diaspora **\[R2, R3\]**. The proletarian allegory that was built on the afterlife of Burns served to support a particular Scottish ethos, one claiming roots in a collective spirit and a greater \(than in England\) sense of community. Yet evidence was also uncovered, in poetry and song, where Burns was reinterpreted as an inspiration to British unity in the first half of the twentieth century and to universal values in the contemporary period.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  Cultural institutions and curatorial interpretation 

 The underpinning research has influenced curatorial interpretation in three Scottish museums. At the National Museum of Scotland, Morton’s research **\[R4**, **R5**, **R6\]** formed the basis of a display at the exhibition ‘Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland’ \(June\-November 2019\). The lead curator of the exhibition confirms that Morton’s research on the cults of Wallace and Bruce was placed alongside the history of Walter Scott to explain ‘romantic nationalism’ **\[E1\]**. One reviewer on Tripadvisor said: ‘I visited this exhibition with a friend and cannot rate it highly enough. Very user friendly with many fascinating facts about the romantic image of the Highlands post Culloden which persists to this day’ \(September 2019\). 

 Whatley’s research was used by the National Trust for Scotland’s Robert Burns Birthplace Museum to support its interpretation of the bard’s social significance. The conclusions from **R2** and **R3** were added to the ‘Burnsometer’ display, which charts the growing fame and influence of Burns over time. The inaugural curator confirms that the research was also used when the Trust reinterpreted the Burns Monument \(1823\) \- adjacent to the museum within the Memorial Gardens \- after major refurbishment in 2018\-19. Attracting over two million visitors since it opened in 2011, many from overseas, the £21m Birthplace Museum can better interpret Burns’ influence on Scottish national identity because of Whatley’s research **\[E2\]**. The research was also used by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery to interpret its collections, particularly the ‘invaluable’ national and international database of Burns sculptural monuments **\[R3\]**. The gallery’s Senior Curator of British Art described **R2** as ‘revelatory on a national and international scale’ **\[E3\]**. 

 **Public understanding** 

 The research on Wallace has influenced public understanding nationally and internationally. Morton was invited by the St Andrew’s Society of Toronto to curate a public symposium and Celtic concert to memorialise the 700<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn, contrasting the afterlives of Wallace and Bruce through to the modern day \(21/6/14, c.150 people\) **\[R5\]**. Meeting the Society’s remit to ‘celebrate Scottish heritage and support our community’, the audience included members of the Society, the general public of Ontario, and affiliated clan and Burns societies. In the Society’s *Newslette*r, this collaboration was described as having been ‘a wonderful opportunity to learn about the “Scottish Narrative” across the centuries’ \(No. 3, Sept 2014, p. 5\). A member writing on behalf of the Society contacted Morton \(25/6/14\): ‘I was deeply impressed with both the amount of research undertaken and the depth of knowledge you provided, and I remain grateful for all that you did to make this important commemoration so intellectually rewarding’. Feedback sent to the Society confirmed that the event had raised awareness: ‘I wanted to congratulate you all on the day. I overheard one young man on the phone … telling his wife that it was a really good day and that he was learning lots about Bannockburn.’ Another wrote: ‘I've been thinking about returning to university and taking more courses—this is the impetus I needed\!’ **\[E4\]**. 

 Reflecting on the symposium and a public talk given in collaboration with the Toronto\-based Scottish Studies Foundation \(SSF\) in 2016, members of the Scottish diaspora were informed that ‘… Graeme \[Morton\]'s work on Wallace has not only been informative in its own right, but has moved many Scots\-Canadians to look to their own identity and to explore their Scots heritage’ **\[E5\]**. Morton was also invited to address the Scottish\-Canadian community in Vancouver on Wallace by delivering the Annual Tartan Day Lecture on behalf of Simon Fraser University and its affiliated diaspora groups \(9/4/16\); and to inform c.100 of the Scottish\-American community in New York on behalf of the Scottish government \- on emigration after the Union \- during Tartan Week \(2/4/19\) **\[E6\]**. After presenting new research to the membership of the SSF in September 2019 **\[R6\]**, the Foundation’s President commented: ‘once again your research not only reinforced our members' understanding of Wallace but how, in new ways, we might view how Scotland's national identity has evolved since the Union of 1707’ **\[E7\]**. 

 Public interest in **R4** led to invitations for Morton to speak at a number of high\-profile events in Scotland. They included the Edinburgh International Book Festival \(24/8/15\) where Morton addressed an audience of c.300 people. One commentator stated: ‘Of all the lectures I attended at the Edinburgh Book Festival, Morton's crowd contained the highest percentage of Scots, all of whom were eager to see the facts of their great national hero parsed out from the legends that have overtaken him’ **\[E8\].** Other talks included the Wigtown Book festival \(2/10/15\) and ‘Previously … Scotland’s History Festival’ \(22/11/15\), where Morton gave the closing lecture. 

 Whatley’s research on the Union of 1707 and its legacies **\[R1\]** led to the creation of the Five Million Questions public forum \(5MQ\) in Dundee. Established in the run\-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and led by Whatley, 5MQ enabled the issues surrounding independence to be examined in a public space where the complexity of nationalist and unionist versions of history was recognised, and where political events were discussed in their historical context **\[E6\]**. Whatley’s analysis of the Union’s origins and how it had structured national identity since 1707 attracted over 300 people to that 5MQ event \(29/5/14\). A Scottish Labour MSP with a twitter following of 8500 was inspired to lead a twitter discussion on how sixteenth\-century conceptions of political union shaped the Union agreement in 1707. Over 360 people attended the concluding event of 5MQ, a debate led by Whatley on the ‘Referendum of 2014 in Historical perspective’ \(27/9/14\). Over 7,000 people attended 5MQ events in total, and its YouTube channel passed 16,000 hits **\[E9\]**. It established a high public profile across the UK by including Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon and Alastair Darling amongst its speakers. 

 The unit’s Scottish history research is also actively disseminated to wider audiences through a collaboration between its Centre for Scottish Culture \(CSC\) and the preeminent public history magazine in Scotland, *History Scotland*. A series of public lectures hosted jointly by the Centre and the magazine were filmed, transcribed, and published. This partnership was launched with Whatley’s debate on Jacobitism and the Union \(based on **R1**\), which achieved 24,688 views on YouTube. One attendee at the debate commented that ‘it widened my view and made me consider other interpretations’. Our partners confirm the value of using our research in this way: ‘these links allow us to further our aims of bringing world class research to an engaged and enthusiastic audience’ **\[E10\]**. 

 **Informing audiences via the media** 

 The unit’s research on Scottish history also had a high media profile, a key way in which it informed public understanding. Contributions to media coverage and discussions of the historical context of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum were extensive. Whatley’s expertise on the Union of 1707 and its legacies was in high demand from local and national journalists. Whatley was sought out for comment by Associated Press, STV, *Scotsman*, BBC Scotland, BBC Radio 2 \(Jeremy Vine\), BBC Radio 4, Sky News, *Le Figaro*, *Frankfurter Allgemeine*, *La Segunda*, *British Politics Review* \(Norway\), and the American news and comment website *The Daily Beast* \(1m readers per day\). One newspaper which used his research to advance political debate, described Whatley as a ‘top historian voicing his view on independence’ \( *Daily Record* 12/11/13; circulation c.106,000\). *Publico* translated Whatley’s conclusion that the Union of 1707 made sense to eighteenth\-century contemporaries and that it had long created a positive environment for Scots \(14/9/14\). The Europe correspondent for ABC Radio in Australia, Barbara Miller, interviewed Whatley to help her listeners understand why the analogous economic challenges of 1707 were apparently being ignored in the 2014 debate \(‘Scots divided on eve of historic poll’, 17/9/14\). A survey of academics who attained impact during the Referendum debate concluded: ‘top of the list of honour is Professor Chris Whatley’ \(Kerevan & Cochrane, *Scottish Independence,* 2014: 134\-5\). Because of its influence in shaping public debate, 5MQ and Whatley’s research were featured in Channel 4’s ‘Dispatches’ \(7/7/14\) and in *The Times*, following a lecture given in the Scottish Parliament \(29/9/14\). The objectivity of 5MQ was endorsed by the First Minister \(Scottish Parliament, 13/11/13\). Brian Taylor, Political Editor for BBC Scotland, portrayed 5MQ as ‘thoughtful and valuable’ for the insights it gave to his reporting \(BBC News, 22/9/15\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2006, Ó Dónaill designed and developed open educational resources utilising new technology. He removed barriers to accessing authentic learning materials and provided content and technical guidance for Irish language teachers and learners. 

 **I1: Catalysing the shift to digital teaching and learning of Irish**. A transformative open digital platform, CLILSTORE.eu, was created and exploited by over 5,500 learners. 

 **I2**: **Accelerating the shift to digital teaching.** Developing training programmes incorporating technical guidance in language pedagogy and know\-how in the creation of multimedia resources for over 30 EU practitioners. 

 **I3**: **Sustaining innovation by creating a new Community of Practice.** Creating a varied Community of Practice contributing to the creation and promotion of authentic, digital Irish and Scottish Gaelic linguistic data. The synergy between R&D in language learning and direct stakeholder engagement has produced tangible benefits for the target end user groups during the reporting period. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 During the 2000s Ulster steadily established its credentials in the international community of practitioners with its sector\-leading work in computer assisted language learning \(CALL\). During the census period we have been able to broaden and strengthen our expertise in that area. In Irish language teaching and learning, Ó Dónaill focused on how the field is served by CALL. His 2006 paper co\-authored with Mac Coinnigh \(Ulster 2003\-2007\) \( **R1**\), established how delivering target language content multimodally had the potential to improve how Irish language learners retain vocabulary. 

 Lack of progression in written and spoken ability, especially among Year 1 Undergraduates, a lack of active participation during tutorials and conversation classes, and the dearth of suitable resources for teaching the language within a HE setting and for independent study influenced Ó Dónaill's investigation between 2006 and 2009 \( **R2**\) of effective practice in CALL, covering the design of learning spaces; methods for facilitating productive interrogation of authentic speech content; peer collaboration; and the use of automated feedback. 

 Dissemination of the research summarised in \( **R2**\), via presentations, bespoke task\-based learning workshops, and presentations at international conferences, led Ó Dónaill to join with CALL researchers in other European countries \(Denmark, Scotland, Spain, Portugal, Lithuania and Belgium\) to design the TOOLS for CLIL Teachers project. 

 Ó Dónaill's 2013 paper \( **R3**\) demonstrated how the new pedagogical and technological interventions developed by the TOOLS project were indeed effective. It reported on research trials that tested the efficacy of autonomous and social learning tasks where learners engaged with sample materials that combined audio\-visual language content, cognitive challenges and vocabulary scaffolding tools. The rationale for this experiment was rooted in constructivist learning theory. **R3** validated the proposition that basing autonomous language materials on authentic, real\-world content is a key factor in motivating learners to engage with socially contextualised language and so achieve better learning gain. 

 The above research also demonstrated the benefits of extending the application of task\-based learning theory to models of Content and Language Integrated learning \(CLIL\) delivery. In 2013, along with colleagues from two partner institutions \(UPV Spain and SDE College Denmark\), Ó Dónaill designed and delivered a comprehensive technical and theoretical training course to 30 primary and secondary level teachers from across Europe. The course curriculum drew on insights gained by the designers from previous training workshops in the TOOLS project; there, trainees had revealed critical gaps in their background knowledge about CALL, CLIL and second language acquisition theory which had prevented them from fully engaging with the learning technology potential of CLILSTORE, the Open Educational Resource \(OER\) developed by the TOOLS for CLIL Teachers project. CLILSTORE serves as a repository of open access materials and an authoring tool that enables educators to create multimedia learning units combining audio, video, text, images and Web 3.0 applications such as self\-correcting comprehension tasks. The authoring software helps to underpin learner autonomy by the way it treats embedded texts. Typescripts of audio or audio\-visual recordings are automatically linked word for word to a nexus of online dictionaries that helps learners boost their reading skills. \( **R4**\) shows how this course helped to advance CLIL in Europe and to underpin subsequent EU projects and CLIL training programmes. In particular, the study confirmed that teachers were willing to adopt CLIL in their classes and that CLILSTORE was perceived as a key tool for creating and sharing scaffolded learning materials.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Ó Dónaill was commissioned to develop projects that have benefitted end users across from four educational sectors: Primary, Secondary, Higher Education \(HE\) and Further Education \(FE\). He developed open educational resources utilising new technology. He removed barriers to accessing authentic learning materials and provided content and technical guidance for language teachers and learners of Irish. 

 **I1: Catalysing the shift to digital teaching and learning of Irish** 

 The TOOLS project \(2012\-2014\) developed CLILSTORE, an OER that enables teachers to author multimedia learning units using online software and share units via a materials repository. Units typically feature audio or audio\-visual content and verbatim transcripts. CLILSTORE links all words in transcripts to online dictionaries via a bespoke multi\-dictionary interface, also developed by the project. Insights from **R1** and **R2** on multimodal and task\-based learning were incorporated during the design phase. This new OER has now been employed by a wide target audience, as a result of the comprehensive technical guides, training workshops and dissemination carried out by Ó Dónaill and partners in the project consortium. The project outputs were assessed by ALB CONSEIL \(an external evaluation consultancy based in Belgium\) who concluded that: “ *The added value of the results for the real needs of the 3 planned education sectors and additional for Comenius sector, the impact due to intensive dissemination and exploitation results across EU and on other continents, the proved sustainability beyond the funded lifetime of the project, the synergies with other EU\-funded projects, networks and stakeholders of languages learning, all these make the project TOOLS a candidate for best practice in languages projects and innovation in education”* \( **C1**, pg.14\). 

 The European Commission’s Education, Audio\-visual and Culture Executive Agency awarded the project a score of 9/10 in its final evaluation of the project \( **C1**, pg.1\). The final project report submitted in September 2014 included details of 584 registered users. As a result of sustained dissemination and peer\-to\-peer knowledge transfer, CLILSTORE has continued to recruit new authors, with the system now having 4,552 registered users. By 31/12/2020, 7,428 learning units in approximately 30 languages had been created covering approximately 40 countries, incorporating the EEA, East Asia, the Americas and Australasia. The learning units have generated 3,816,282 views to date and 644,797 dictionary consultations have been performed. 327 units for Irish had been created, which have generated 252,742 views to date and 108,387 dictionary consultations. 

 In 2016, the EC selected TOOLS as an Erasmus Success Story and Best Practice example. The EC continues to promote the project to stakeholders in language education via its website \( **C2**\). This recognition has assisted with growth in new users among teachers who require a free and effective content authoring system for bespoke language learning materials. Core members of the TOOLS project, including Ó Dónaill, successfully bid for EUR348,438 \(09\-2018\) in funding from the European Commission in 2017 to further develop CLILSTORE via the CLIL Open Online Learning Project. The application evaluation report summarised the project's significance and acknowledged the strong legacy of the TOOLS project: 

 *“The project addresses European policies in relation to the modernization of education, improving of the quality of educators and optimising the learning outcomes of students via CLIL methodology. The objectives are clearly established and, given the profile of the partners, are achievable. The transnational dimension clearly adds value. The quality of the consortium is very high, given their complementary profiles and their previous experience in common projects related to the current one. The management plan is complete and described in detail. The results have the potential to be transferred and exploited in other European countries through the English language. The dissemination plan is effective and is supported by the EuroCALL organization. The sustainability of the platform is guaranteed after the end of the project, as has happened with the previous TOOLS Project \(2014\). This project incorporates a significant upgrade to CLILSTORE”* \( **C3**, translation of original Spanish text\). 

 In February 2021 an end user survey was circulated to a sample group of registered users of CLILSTORE from all target educational sectors to analyse the impact of the tool from 2014 to 2020. Analysis of the responses shows that a clear majority of the respondents view CLILSTORE as an indispensable tool that they rely on to scaffold learning for their students. They also praised CLILSTORE for helping them transition from paper\-based and analogue resources to adopting more productive technology\-enhanced learning methods. A cross\-section of educational practitioners who had registered with CLILSTORE was invited to provide feedback on a range of factors relating to the OER’s functionality and the impact it had made to their professional practice. There were 61 responses with a sectoral breakdown of Secondary = 36%; HE = 28%; FE = 27%; Other \(Primary, Community\) = 9%. 

 **Exploitation:** 50% of respondents use the OER to create learning units for students, while a further 36% both employ existing units and create new units for their classes. **Uniqueness:** 41% of users reported they would not be able to replicate the functionality of CLILSTORE by using other software solutions, while also confirming that the learning outcomes of their students improved through their advocation of CLILSTORE. **Innovation:** 80% agreed the resource supports innovation, with 60% of respondents confirming that they had gained new ideas from using the resource, and 53% reporting they were able to promote independent learning for their students “ *in a way not previously possible*”. **Awareness:** 64% of the users agreed that using CLILSTORE supports intercultural awareness. Open feedback responses further commended the resource e.g. “ *\[CLILSTORE offers\] the opportunity to have a huge selection of subject matters of your interest*” and “ *\[CLILSTORE\] has a lot of potential for increasing students’ interaction with the target language independently*” \( **C5**\). 

 **I2** *:* **Accelerating the shift to digital teaching** 

 In 2014, with two colleagues from the TOOLS project, Ó Dónaill designed a theoretical and practical training programme based on the project outputs. They trialled this 2\-week course in August 2014 with 30 primary and secondary teachers at Executive Training Institute, Malta \(ETI\). The course was approved by Comenius, who funded teachers to participate. A post\-course survey demonstrated the course had successfully achieved its learning goals: 

 **“**Regarding the degree of confidence in applying CLIL after taking the course...over 65% of the participants perceive CLIL as an optimal methodology to teach both content and language. The participants’ confidence to provide multimodal input and distribute it evenly across their CLIL units increased to...nearly 90%. Self\-confidence in being able to incline the balance towards student\-centred learning rather than teacher\-centred learning was another of the attributes where the course had helped participants gain assertiveness: very confident \(33.33%\) and confident \(51.85%\), adding up to a total of 85% of the participants. Additionally, 77.8% of the respondents claimed that the introductory course on CLIL and the use of CLILSTORE had changed their views on teacher\-centred versus learner\-centred learning.”* \( **R4**, pg. 111\). 

 Based on the continuing demand for dedicated CLIL training for teachers in Europe, ETI adopted the course, embedding it fully into its provision. By July 2020 ETI had trained 764 teachers from 30 different countries in CLIL methodology and how to use CLILSTORE \( **C8**\). ETI reports that the adoption of the TOOLS training programme has enabled it to become a key stakeholder in CLIL teacher training across Europe: 

 *“Since adopting the CLIL pilot course ETI has revised and adapted it to suit the changing needs of students, while still retaining the core elements of CLIL theory training and materials authoring using CLILSTORE. Collaborating with the TOOLS Project has been a game changer for ETI. As the uptake of CLIL methodology has grown across Europe we have been able to pivot and align our taught programmes to meet the training needs that have resulted from that growth”  \( **C8**\). 

 Teachers using CLILSTORE report that it enables them to significantly improve the learning gains of their students, particularly regarding vocabulary acquisition and aural comprehension \( **C5**\). An external evaluator concluded that the TOOLS project successfully addressed the dearth of user\-friendly authoring software designed especially for teachers, stimulating their methodological “ *shift from passive consumption of ready­made programmes to independent building of content, tailor made for specific groups or individuals*” \( **C1**\). CLILSTORE “ *provided the students with a platform which they can draw upon when mastering the language, not only during the autumn and spring academic semesters, but also when they are continuing to study the language as independent learners*” \( **C10**\). 

 From 2009 to 2013 a taskforce of HE practitioners designed a new international syllabus for Irish language undergraduates. Ó Dónaill's research insights \( **R2**\) influenced the design of the syllabus based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and he additionally led a 'digital first' approach to disseminating the syllabus. The syllabus includes technical and pedagogical guidance for teachers and audio and video materials that can be used directly from the site \(teagascnagaeilge.ie\), which is hosted by Ulster. Since August 2013, this resource has been used continuously by 17 third level institutions in Ireland, EU and the USA, where it has improved learner attainment and engagement with Irish \( **C7, C10**\). For example, a director of Celtic Languages and Literatures programmes at UBO Brest confirmed that the syllabus was “ *a life\-saver for the modern language component*” of the programme enabling them to “ *advise the Irish teaching assistants as to the syllabus they could use in terms of clearly set learning outcomes and lessons plans”* \( **C10**\). 

 **I3** *:* **Sustaining innovation by creating a new Community of Practice** 

 Based on findings from **R3** on the benefits of repurposing audio and video content to make authentic language learning units, Ó Dónaill launched further initiatives to expand the Irish language materials in CLILSTORE. 

 \(1\) In 2014 he established a partnership with Irish national broadcaster RTÉ to develop media initiatives to contribute to the advancement of the Government of Ireland’s 20 Year Irish Language Strategy \( **C9**, p.89\). Through this partnership Ó Dónaill has created CLILSTORE units utilising recordings from RTÉ's archive, thereby revitalising its approach to radio content and providing educational opportunities to the audience. This has benefitted learners of Irish in Ireland and internationally \(in France, **C10**, and the USA, **C7**\) to engage more successfully with native speaker dialects: “ *since 2016, I have commended these resources to my undergraduate and graduate students and I have noticed how \[CLILSTORE\] has expanded its Irish language resources. Although my students can access a variety of Irish language radio stations via the internet, nonetheless, comprehending native speakers talking at full live pace remains a challenge. Taking recordings offline and slowing them down certainly helps a little, but the blend of native/natural speech combined with transcripts linked to dictionaries in \[CLILSTORE\] really opens doors to understanding. My students also like the variety of materials, such as the folklore, the films shot on location in Donegal and Scotland, the authentic Raidió na Gaeltachta interviews and, in particular, the Irish Poetry units produced by our Colleagues at Dublin City University*”, as stated by the Director of University of Notre Dame’s Centre for Languages \( **C7**\). 

 \(2\) To explore new models for producing authentic content, Ó Dónaill obtained GBP9,750 in Foras na Gaeilge funding to establish a cultural exchange between inhabitants of Irish and Scottish Gaelic speaking areas in Donegal and Benbecula. Building on the findings from the Tools for CLIL Teachers project \( **R3**\), as well as on a pilot residential in Ireland \(March 2013\), a workshop was developed and held in Scotland in October 2014. During the workshop Ó Dónaill led the filming of culturally enriching encounters featuring speakers from both communities. 

 \(3\) Co\-produced cultural artefacts based on the workshop recordings were edited and published online. A selection of the films was additionally used to make a series of CLILSTORE units that have been well used since 2014 and have resonated strongly with learners of Irish and Scottish Gaelic \( **C7**\). Foras na Gaeilge/Colmcille who funded the project note that “ *In our view, the Guthanna na nOileán \(voices of the Islands\) project led to a profound and productive cultural exchange between the Irish and Gaelic speaking communities of Ireland and Scotland. The fact that the project openly published video recordings from the workshops and created learning materials from them meant that the exchange has benefitted many more people beyond the direct participants, which we can clearly see from the viewing statistics for the videos and CLILSTORE units. In addition, this project has established a new model for future exchanges between these communities and Islands.”  \( **C6**\) 

 \(4\) In March 2014, as part of the POOLS3 project’s outreach programme, Ó Dónaill delivered a training workshop in materials development to staff at St. Patrick's College, Dublin \(Dublin City University since 2016\). This covered technical training in CLILSTORE and an introduction to Ó Dónaill’s research\-informed rationale for using it. The staff were subsequently motivated to develop a series of units on Irish Literature featuring new video recordings of readings and interviews with renowned Irish language poets. The units also include a suite of bespoke interactive learning tasks. These materials have been extremely well utilised by students of Irish literature nationally and internationally \(e.g. **C7**\), with 44,235 views and 12,233 dictionary consultations to date. They have been embedded into programmes of study at St. Patrick's College/Dublin City University leading to “ *a system\-wide impact, with high levels of usage reported. The expert input of Dr Caoimhín Ó Dónaill, his championing of \[CLIL\] as a field of action research and his commitment to innovative research\-led pedagogies, were the motivating factors behind this work. Undoubtedly, his work has contributed hugely to creating and strengthening an Irish language CLIL community of practice and will continue to do so in the years ahead.”  \( **C3**\)

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Mathematical analysis and modelling by Dr Cook at the University of Strathclyde has identified ways to improve the internationally accepted assessment of a shared cod stock to the west of Scotland. This work resulted in a review of the assessment and a consequent change to the estimated exploitation rate of the stock by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea \(ICES\). On the basis of this and the related underpinning research, Cook has established international reputation that has led to him making significant contributions in similar activities, including: reviewing fisheries assessments conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the USA; being invited to assess the Marine Stewardship Council quality certification standard for fisheries worldwide; and influencing the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\) fisheries policy. Together, these activities are helping fishery managers around the world manage fish stocks more effectively, sustainably and profitably. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

###  Context 

 The widespread and growing global demand for fish products supports a multi\-billion\-dollar commercial fishing industry. However, there is increasing scientific, political and public awareness of the damage to marine ecosystems caused by overfishing, especially since the widely reported collapse of Canada’s Atlantic cod stocks in the early 1990s. In order to balance the demand for fish products with the need to protect marine environments, it is increasingly important that fishery managers have access to accurate assessments of fish stock health so that they can effectively and sustainably manage such stocks. Cook’s research aims to provide this through multiple lines of enquiry, as detailed below. 

###  Review of Northeast Atlantic fish stocks 

 In 2013, Cook analysed fish stocks in the Northeast Atlantic, where the majority of stocks are subject to the European Union’s Common Fisheries Policy \(CFP\), a set of rules governing fishing fleets with the aim of conserving fish stocks. The analysis demonstrated that most stocks in the region were recovering and that management interventions were showing some success \[ **R1**\]. This finding challenged the widely held perception that fish stocks in the Northeast Atlantic were in decline and that the CFP had been a failure. A 2019 assessment by Cook of cod stocks in the west of Scotland also suggested that these stocks have experienced a decline in fishing mortality rate and an increase in spawning stock biomass \[ **R2**\]. 

###  Development of new methodologies to assess fish stocks 

 In order to accurately assess the effect of fishing on marine ecosystems it is essential that robust assessments can be made of exploited fish stocks. Cook’s research has focussed on the development of state\-space models that can integrate data from a variety of sources, by accounting for the processes that gave rise to the observations and weighting the data in an objective statistical framework, so that the exploitation status of fish stocks can be monitored. The models make use of time series methods and are cast in a Bayesian framework. Particular novel aspects of this research relate to fish discarded at sea and bycatch of less abundant species that are important for biodiversity. 

 Quantities of discarded fish can be large, accounting for as much as 50% of the catch. However, as discarding occurs at sea it is rarely observed, and discard data are often extremely sparse and unreliable \[ **R3**\]. Further research by Cook therefore focussed on developing a methodology to account for discards in fish stock assessments \[ **R4**\]. This was achieved by modelling the size selection of fish by fishers and the effects of quota limits on discard behaviour. Where the available data are very limited to assess stocks, methods were developed which made greater use of research vessel survey data that have been collected for many years but not fully exploited as an information source \[ **R5**\]. By combining this information with landings data, new models were developed which allow the use of size frequency data to assess population status for stocks. The population model is stage structured \(recruits, juveniles, adults etc.\) making it possible to use length data as a proxy for age. This allows the assessment of stocks for which the absence of age data had previously prevented assessment and which therefore resulted in little or no advice being available to managers \[ **R5**\]. 

###  Investigating the effect of seal predation on cod stocks 

 Another important strand of Cook’s research has focussed on quantifying the effects of grey seal predation on the west of Scotland cod stock \[ **R6**\], a previously overlooked area of cod stock assessment. This work required the development of a state\-space population dynamics model that included a predation sub\-model for seals. The model can make use of periodic observations of seal diet collected by the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University to estimate the parameters of a predator functional response and hence estimate the predation mortality. The model can more realistically estimate current fish stock size by taking into account this mortality and can be used to investigate fish stock recovery under different seal population scenarios \[ **R6**\]. As relevant data is limited, a key element of the modelling is to include time series processes to overcome the problem of missing data. Using a Bayesian approach it is also possible to obtain more realistic posterior distributions of quantities of interest, such as stock biomass, so that uncertainty can be made more transparent to fishery managers. Knowing the level of uncertainty in assessments is important as it allows managers to avoid fishing strategies which might deplete stocks past minimum biomass levels. This research concluded that grey seal predation was suppressing stock recovery despite a drop in fishing mortality \[ **R6**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Cook’s academic reputation has enabled him to make significant and internationally important contributions to sustainable fishing, which is a key factor for food security globally and of major economic importance for many countries. Cook’s contributions include assessing fish stocks, reviewing prior fish stock assessments, providing advice in managing major fish stocks and providing guidelines to government in negotiating fish quotas. These activities cover jurisdictions in Europe, North America and Africa, and are exemplified by the following examples of impacts of Cook’s work, where a ‘fishery’ refers to the harvesting of stocks by national fleets. 

### 1.  Reassessing the state of west of Scotland cod stocks 

 The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea \(ICES\) is the official inter\-governmental body for providing scientific advice on fishery management in the northeast Atlantic. EU and Norwegian fisheries management is based on ICES advice. The stocks on which it advises cover over 200 stocks of fish and shellfish that are worth hundreds of millions of pounds at first sale each year. Changes to ICES advice therefore often have significant economic impacts for fisheries. 

 Until Cook’s research, the internationally agreed ICES assessment of the west of Scotland cod stock suggested that the exploitation rate remained very high and that the stock has collapsed. The resulting zero catch limit for cod prevents trawlers from catching associated healthy stocks such as haddock and whiting, with corresponding economic impacts. However, the research reported above suggested that this assessment had not taken into account the significant role of seal predation on cod stocks. Moreover, the 2013 analysis of west of Scotland fish stocks indicated that the stock may have been recovering and that exploitation had reduced substantially since the beginning of the 21st century. The impact of these findings was widely reported in the mainstream press and trade media \(e.g. BBC News, The Scotsman, Science Daily, World Fishing and Aquaculture\), focussing on the threat posed by seals to fish stock recovery \[ **S1**\]. In January 2019, ICES agreed to review its assessment of west of Scotland cod in light of Cook’s research, and in February 2020 ICES adopted a new model that confirms the reduction in exploitation \[ **S2**: references **R2**, **R4** and **R6**\]. As a result of this review, the role of seals is now recognised in ICES advice to the European Commission \[ **S3**\], which explicitly cites Cook’s work \[ **R6**\]. 

### 1.  Ensuring the quality of US fish stock assessments 

 The Center for Independent Experts \(CIE\) is an organisation funded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the USA to conduct reviews of stock assessments carried out by the National Marine Fisheries Service \(NMFS\). NMFS provides scientific advice to the USA’s Regional Management Councils to determine whether their systems of stock assessment provide fishery managers with the necessary information to effectively and sustainably manage fish stocks. This work ensures the quality of assessments in the USA, the world’s third largest fish producing nation, and contributes to sustainable development and stewardship of the country’s marine ecosystems. As Regional Management Councils are required by US law to manage fisheries in a manner consistent with each fishery’s maximum sustainable yield, the work of CIE is intrinsic to the effective and sustainable management of federally owned fish stocks in the USA, which account for the majority of the country’s total catch. 

 The CIE requires highly experienced authorities with an established research track record for reviews. The body of work described above established Cook as a suitable expert, and since 1998 to the present he has consulted on more than 25 reviews covering nearly 100 stocks for all 8 Regional Management Councils of the USA, focussing on a variety of issues from data\-poor stock assessments \[ **S4**\] to modelling discard estimates \[ **S5**\]. Independent expert reviews such as these are an important factor in fisheries management decision making in the USA. Cook’s review of migratory sharks in the Southeast USA, which concluded that the Regional Management Council’s assessment failed to sufficiently inform fishery managers, resulted in withdrawal of the assessment and a subsequent revision which explicitly addressed the review comments \[ **S6**\]. His 2019 review of the Pacific sablefish stock assessment contributed to an understanding that stock exploitation was decreasing rather than increasing, as previously thought. This realisation has allowed the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to raise the advised catch limit for sablefish for the years 2021\-2030 \[ **S7**\], a change which will result in an estimated USD5,100,000 \(10\-2019\) additional catch annually over the said time period. 

### 1.  Promoting sustainable fisheries through the Marine Stewardship Council \(MSC\) 

 The MSC is an international organisation that promotes good fisheries management practice and sustainable exploitation by encouraging consumers, restaurants and retailers to only buy fish products that have received MSC accreditation, certifying a fishery’s environmental and management credentials. Acquiring the accreditation through an initial assessment, and maintaining it via annual audits and five\-year reassessments, is demanding but gives suppliers a competitive advantage as it allows their catch to be sold with the sought\-after MSC ecolabel. As of 2019, 15% of marine catch worldwide is MSC certified, equating to almost USD10,000,000,000 \(02\-2019\) annually. In the UK, consumers spend nearly GBP1,000,000,000 on MSC products annually, and over 3,500 restaurants serve MSC\-accredited products \[ **S8**\]. 

 Assessing fisheries for MSC certification requires a high level of qualification \[ **S9**\]. The body of research reported in Section 2 again qualified Cook as a suitable expert, and since April 2016 he has assessed different fish stocks in many locations around the world, including cod and haddock in the North Sea \(multi\-country\), yellowtail flounder in Canadian waters, hake in Namibia, Patagonian toothfish in French Antarctica and halibut in Greenlandic\-Canadian waters. For Namibia, for example, Cook was a principal co\-author of the assessment that led to MSC certification of the country’s hake demersal trawl and longline fishery, the largest fishery in Namibia. Fishing is the third largest sector in Namibia’s economy and is expected to grow as a direct result of this certification \[ **S10**\]. In another example, Cook’s evaluation of models used to assess North Sea cod confirmed the stock had been over\-exploited by two fisheries and led to suspension of MSC accreditations for both fisheries in October 2019, demonstrating how protection of fish stocks is aided by the MSC process. 

### 1.  Influencing UK fishery policy 

 As a direct result of Cook’s reputation in the field, in September 2020 he was invited to participate in a high profile project, commissioned by the UK Government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\) and led by the Defra Director of Marine and Fisheries, to establish guidelines for officials negotiating fishing quotas post Brexit. The project report, completed in November 2020, sets out methodology to ensure UK fishery management of stocks shared with other coastal states is compliant with maximum sustainable yield. The resulting document, which includes contributions from Cook, is confidential for understandable policy reasons, though a public version will be published when possible.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The **Digital Panopticon** created new opportunities for family historians and students in schools and Higher Education to pursue their own research using the free searchable website’s unique capability to link together over 50 digitised data record sets relating to the offending histories and biographies of 90,000 people tried at the Old Bailey \(1670 and 1925\) \- the most complete record of convict lives ever created. The website, together with the physical exhibitions, public talks/lectures which were formed using the data and the findings, as well as printed/television media which reported or drew upon the research, have demonstrably changed public understandings of criminality in the UK, Australia and the US. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The aim of the **Digital Panopticon** project \(3.1\) was to explore modern issues around the use of imprisonment and re\-offending, using data on people either transported to Australia \(1803\-68\) or imprisoned in the UK \(1853\-1914\). Until the **Digital Panopticon** was launched in 2013 it had been impossible to answer a question originally posed in the 18<sup>th</sup> century by Jeremy Bentham – which was the most effective system of punishment, ‘imprisonment’ or transportation? \(3.2\) Led by the University of Liverpool, professors, researchers, and PGRs from five universities in the UK and Australia joined forces to share methods and ideas. The result was the **Digital Panopticon** website, which combines over 50 datasets about convicts collected together for the first time.  Collating this enormous body of data \(50 million data fields\) made it possible to explore and analyse the lives and criminal careers of over 90,000 individuals who were sentenced at the Old Bailey between 1690 and 1925. The main theme \(Penal Outcomes\), also led by Liverpool, explored the factors – type of punishment, gender, offending record, family relationships, age, re\-offending, and occupation – which either prolonged or shortened criminal careers. Being able to compare in detail large numbers of convicts' offending histories and biographies has allowed us to demonstrate that there were significant factors which supported desistence from offending \(relationship formation, employment, maturation, and the level of reintegration back into the economic and social base of the country they lived in\). At the conclusion we had definitively answered Bentham’s and many other questions, finding that: 

 Non\-custodial sentences \(transportation to Australia\) damaged people’s lives, but not as much as did custodial sentences \(British convict prisons\) \(3.2\). 

 A significant proportion of convicts re\-offended, but transported convicts committed more minor offences than those imprisoned in the UK \(3.2\). 

 Transported women fared better than imprisoned women over the longer term \(3.3\). 

 The children and grandchildren of transported convicts were taller/healthier and had better lives than the children of convicts imprisoned in the UK \(3.4, 3.5\). 

 Non\-custodial sentences for children reduced re\-offending \(3.6\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The **Digital Panopticon** is a freely accessible website with over 300,000 users since 2017 \(5.1\). Described as a vital website for research \(5.4\) *,* user\-beneficiaries ranged from family historians \(“ *To Australians, your project is of national significance. An eye\-opening and jaw dropping project* \[about the\] *foundation of our nation*”, 5.2\); to government ministers \(“ *The project is nationally and internationally significant as it highlights the unique nature of the convict experience in Western Australia and provides a better understanding of our archives and history*”, 5.3\). 

 User\-beneficiaries: pump\-priming family history research 

 By freely sharing our research with the public on the successes and failures of the systems of transportation to Australia and imprisonment in the UK \(something the Australian media described as the “Convict Ashes”, 5.4\), we brought a huge body of data from beyond paywalls to family historians/genealogists. People used data in **Digital Panopticon** together with the online explanatory essays to support large numbers of personal and family research journeys \(5.2\). The results were transformative: “ *Truly heart\-breaking. This is no understatement. Thank you. Thank you. Your project will no doubt reach into many households in Australia and England*” \(5.2\). Many had their family\-stories challenged, confirmed, or explained, and were determined to carry on with their research. “ *I am descended from ten NSW convicts. From the material it appears that after arrival in Australia the women were able to become, or to marry, moderately prosperous and, generally, respectable men … I am now considering how I can use the material I and others have gathered for historical projects*.”  “ *I have been a Civil Servant of some 40 years and worked in Prison Administration for six years I was also an Administrative Researcher to the Inquiry into the Efficacy of the NSW Police Administration. I have used Digital Panopticon to conclude that most transported convicts were far better off after their arrival in Australia*.” \(5.2\). 

 Using Exhibitions from Liverpool to the wider world to change opinion 

 Whilst there was clearly considerable appetite for the website, interest in physical and online exhibitions which used the data was also significant. Partners at the University of Sheffield led on an exhibition \( *Criminal Lives,* December 2018 \- May 2019\) at the London Metropolitan Archives using data from **Digital Panopticon** sourced by **Godfrey** and **Williams** \(Liverpool\-based PDRA\) \(praised by *The Lancet* for its contemporary resonance to debates about contemporary penal reform\). **Godfrey** and **Price** \(Liverpool\-based PDRA\) then organised an exhibition showcasing the impact of punishment on people’s lives at Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral \(5\-12 March 2018\) focusing on Liverpool\-born prisoners to embed stories locally \(3.2, 3.3, 3.4\). Forty of the 3,000\+ visitors from Merseyside \(and wider afield in the UK and across Europe\) who saw the exhibition left comments stating that their views of criminals were changed \(“ *relevant and accessible to a wider audience; Brings dead people alive. What a fantastically informative exhibition – I shall never look at criminals in the same way\!*” 5.5\). We were subsequently invited to take the exhibition to Liverpool Legal Aid Offices to give a talk to staff as part of in\-house training. The Diversity Champion in the Criminal Applications Section stated that after staff had witnessed the similarities in the lives of the Victorian and the modern poor, they had a greater appreciation of the difficulties faced by legal aid applicants today: “ *I know we do the unconscious bias training in work, but I think in our role sometimes you can get certain perceptions of criminals. This exhibition reminds you that you can’t do that…it assists us in our day\-to\-day thinking as caseworkers*” *\(5.6\).* 

 As a result of the success of this exhibition **Godfrey** was asked by National Trust Australia to construct a temporary exhibition at UNESCO world\-heritage\-site, Hobart Penitentiary Chapel, Tasmania *.* The co\-produced exhibition and accompanying public lectures focused on the improvement of social policy towards offenders \(“ *a stunning success…one of the most popular historic experiences in Hobart*” *,* becoming a top\-10 tourist site in Hobart on TripAdvisor, 5.7\). Following the 45% increase in footfall, the exhibition was made permanent. Using some of the existing images with new images of US convicts, an online exhibition was held at the Willson Center \(part of the Uni. of Georgia which hosts exhibitions for students and general public\), launched by an online public lecture on unconscious bias. As a result of this exhibition, in March 2020 **Godfrey** collaborated on a grant application with Alabama Department of Archives & History  to digitize records of African American prisoners using the **Digital Panopticon** model. The project therefore continues to impact on the democratization of data in the UK, Australia and the US. 

 Impacting on public debates 

 Since 2014, there has been considerable engagement with international public audiences. In 2015, **Godfrey** gave the Australia Day Address in London, attended by the Australian High Commissioner and Lord Mayor of the City of London \(5.8\) which led to **Godfrey** giving a private lecture to the Judges at the Central Criminal Court, who then used **Digital Panopticon** data for a theatre production, *Trial and Error*, at the Old Bailey \( **Godfrey** provided data from **Digital Panopticon** and co\-authored the script; performances raised £30,000 for The Sheriffs’ & Recorder’s Fund which provides grants to aid the reform of ex\-prisoners, 5.9\). In May 2017 **Godfrey** organised a week of public lectures and *Findmypast\-*supported family\-history sessions in a Scottish bookshop \(over 100 attendees\). **Godfrey and Williams** introduced the website to the Australian public at the *The Big Convict Debate* at Fremantle Prison \(5/2/2018, 300 attendees\) which was held to mark the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of convict transportation to Australia. Published at the same time and authored by **Godfrey and Williams**, the  [*Conversation* piece](file:///C:/Users/andrewdavies/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/REF2021/ICS.GODFREY/(https:/theconversation.com/the-story-of-australias-last-convicts-89723) on the last Western Australian convict was read by over 100,000 people \(77% of readers were Australian\). There followed a series of public lectures across Australia. A talk at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Perth attracted over 250 adult learners, community historians, local politicians and academics \(“ *We’ve never had so many people staying behind to ask questions”,* 5.2\) *.* State politicians and local people debated prison reform following a public lecture in Tasmania, and media interviews on national TV and radio helped to stimulate debates about the use of imprisonment  \(“ *Professor Godfrey has convinced us that the debate over crime and punishment, reform and rehabilitation is as relevant today as it was two centuries ago*”, *Late Night Live*, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 5.4\). The ABC radio interview/public lectures were made available online; and in 2020, the ABC included **Godfrey’**s programme as one of nine prestigious “Big Ideas” in their series of “ *the best of talks, forums, debates, and festivals held in Australia and around the world, casting light on major social, cultural, scientific and political issues*”, 5.4\). 

 **Digital Panopticon** also indirectly impacted on public attitudes, through providing data and inspiration for the cultural industries. Matthew Crampton, co\-author of the play *The Transports*, performed across UK, stated that he came across the **Digital Panopticon** *“when already deeply engaged in writing and telling stories about transportation* \[and that he\] *was able to make good use of this wonderful resource to find and trace individual cases from the Old Bailey to Australia. Particularly useful are the explanatory guides to different records The **Digital Panopticon** has helped me beyond being a useful resource. It has reinforced my belief that, so long as you make the information personal and relevant, you can lead casual observers willingly into highly detailed records.  It is a fine place to start one’s research, plus, of course, an excellent resource for conducting that research* \(5.2 *\)*.” In addition to Crampton’s use of the data, TV Companies have used **Godfrey**’s research findings to mould their programmes. **Godfrey** provided guidance on life\-course offending to various film production companies \( *Wall to Wall, IKON, Lion Films*\), later becoming consultant \(providing research, advising on and writing scripts\) for Series 13 of *Who Do You Think You Are?* **Godfrey** also providing on\-screen interviews for four episodes \(a weekly audience of over 6,000,000 saw the findings of **Digital Panopticon** used to explain the causes of criminality\). **Godfrey** then worked with a Channel 5 production company, explaining how Digital Panopticon biographical data\-linking can be used for non\-Old Bailey cases, transforming academic research into accessible material which would appeal to a wide audience and providing source material/interviews broadcast in 2019 \(5.2\). 

 Creating active learners 

 By creating a website where students can engage directly with data, the **Digital Panopticon** has created active school\- and undergraduate student researchers who are now able to design their own projects. It has become a central part of annually run research\-led undergraduate modules in the UK, Australia and the US \(5.10\). This has helped to transform pedagogic practices using digital humanities to inform, challenge, and stimulate students; to provide an excellent teaching experience for tutors and learners; and to extend the boundaries of the possible with regard to the use of historical data in school and undergraduate settings. Undergraduates have seized the opportunity to manipulate and investigate data on their own, and to construct their own research: In HAA007 Convict Ancestors \(300 students\), University of Tasmania Diploma of Family history students \(many non\-traditional entry and adult\-learners\) are introduced to the Digital Panopticon and trained to search its collections to enrich the study of a single life course. Students on HAA105 Convicts in Context \(210 students\) are provided with a detailed online tour of the Digital Panopticon and shown how to use its features to do more complex searches. They then explore the lives of prisoners who share a particular characteristic \(i.e. convicted of a particular crime, transported to Australia, or imprisoned in the UK\), to use data to, really, make their own research. The freedom was enthusing and invigorating for students \(“ *HAA105 scored 98% approval*”, 5.10\). 

 At the University of Georgia, HIST 3775 students use **Digital Panopticon** to construct a research question and write up either a formal research proposal or a research paper: “ *My students find it challenging to shift from the standard assignment of reading and discussing written sources to conducting data analysis and charting their own course to a research topic and thesis. Nevertheless, it is precisely this kind of novel, hands\-on research project that encourages students to practice self\-activated learning. Some students resist and struggle more than others but, by the end of the process, all of them have expressed their satisfaction with work which they can really call their own…the experience is transformative”* \(5.10\). 

 Using **Digital Panopticon** in this way has not only transformed their undergraduate learning experiences and achievements, but has also provided a route to enrichment of their employment and post\-education experiences: *“…at least a dozen of the students who got their first taste of digital humanities research with Digital Panopticon have gone on to work in the Digital Humanities Center as participants in summer workshops, interns, or as teaching assistants…For the past three years students who prepared the strongest research essay using the Digital Panopticon won the History Department's Award for Best Digital Humanities Project*” \(5.10\).

 The Sound/Image Cinema Lab \(SICL\) is a multifaceted partner, funder, resource and research centre dedicated to the production and education of independent film at Falmouth University. It produced and co\-produced 14 commercial films \(2015\-20\), working in partnership with industry, resulting in professional level learning experiences for 173 undergraduate and postgraduate students, and 41 graduates. These experiences accelerated professional development and increased attainment on film courses at Falmouth University. SICL also benefited cinema audiences and 15 industry companies for whom production would not have been possible without SICL or not possible to the same degree of quality. One project, *Bait*, took over £500,000 at the UK cinema box office, won a BAFTA in early 2020 and was nominated for the Outstanding British Film of the Year Award.

1.  **Underpinning research** 

 The Sound/Image Cinema Lab \(SICL\) project responded to a variety of conditions in the contemporary UK film industry including the need for greater opportunities for film producers \(individuals and organisations\) to access funding and resources, a need for greater diversity of regional voices and places onscreen \[Denzil Monk, RO2\] and a greater diversity of backgrounds ‘behind the camera’. SICL also addressed gaps in learning and professional development inherent due to the limits of classroom teaching that can only be sufficiently addressed in professional contexts on professional projects. \[Neil Fox, RO1\] 

 SICL is a multifaceted partner, funder, resource and research centre dedicated to the production and education of independent film. Based at Falmouth University, the Lab is convened by senior lecturer Dr Neil Fox \[at Falmouth since 2013\]. Falmouth University academic staff also active in the Lab as practitioners and researchers are Dr Kingsley Marshall \[at Falmouth since 2006\], Denzil Monk \[at Falmouth since 2015\], and Mark Jenkin \[at Falmouth since 2008\]. The Lab produced and co\-produced a series of regional and national, narrative and documentary, short and feature films from 2015 onwards including ‘ *Wilderness’* \[RO3, 2017\], *Bait* \[RO4, 2018\], *Backwoods* \[2018\] and *Hard, Cracked the Wind* \[2018\]. 

 The structure of the research was to build models of partnership with the aim of increasing the scope for British independent film production that provided career development opportunities and enhancement. These partnerships were made up of interventions on the part of SICL that included core funding, completion funding, student, graduate or staff crew sourcing and deployment and technical resource support – for example, camera, lighting, sound, post\-production facilities. 

 Each production project had a different goal and framework all under a practice led research methodology, whereby production practice was undertaken to answer a series of questions. This was achieved by reflecting on productions to uncover knowledge as to the potential impact of interventions on pedagogy and professional practice. For example, lessons learned from ‘ *Wilderness’* \[RO3\] led to changes in practice and focus on *Bait* \[RO4\]. By focusing on practice in what might be termed a ‘commercial’ or ‘mainstream’ space, the SICL research activity sought to pose questions of relevance to a broad spectrum of industry beneficiaries. 

 Questions included ‘how to engage with production companies according to their needs and the means and abilities of SICL?’ \[RO3, RO4\]. Also, ‘what is a relative pedagogical component for different levels of support that will ensure maximum opportunity for students and graduates?’ \[RO3, RO4, RO5, RO6\]. 

 The nature of the findings and outcomes demonstrate that university film schools can play a positive, vital role in increasing production scope through the investment of funding and resources. It is also found that a range of opportunities for students and graduates can be developed and the scale of the projects that seek to work with the film school and their production scope can grow. All the films are professional artefacts created with SICL input and some also act as research artefacts \[RO3, RO4\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The SICL project has resulted in a variety of impacts for stakeholders and beneficiaries. Stakeholders that benefit from the activities of SICL in the business sector are film production companies and in the private/public sector organisations supporting the Cornish film economy, including the regional film agency Screen Cornwall.  Beneficiaries include the general public in the form of regional, national and international audiences and, in the public and private sector, graduates and students developing their professional skills and networks and enhancing and accelerating their industry employment trajectories, as detailed below. 

 **Impact on Film Production in the UK** 

 There were 15 production companies that benefited from support they would not have had access to otherwise. SICL enabled productions \(9 feature, 5 short\) and increased the scope of those productions, achieving a level of quality hitherto beyond reach. 

 Martha Tilston \[T1\] who directed the SICL supported feature film, *The Tap* \(2020\), said *“working with recent MA graduate editor Marcus Cook and using SICL facilities meant that we were able to push the film both creatively and technically.”* In the case of the short film *Mr Whippy* \(2019\), completion funding from SICL ensured that the film could go into production. Emerging producer and Falmouth Film graduate Kamilla Kristiane Hodøl \[T2\] said of the BFI backed short, that SICL “ *made an invaluable contribution to a short film \[…\] to help launch the career of Rachna Suri, an exciting up\-and\-coming director from an under\-represented background, and \[…\] contribute to the diversity and excellence of the British film industry.”* BAFTA\-winning producers Early Day Films \[T3\] said of SICL’s involvement in *Bait* *“without \[SICL support\] we would have had to leave Cornwall to complete the film.”* *Bait* took £532,000 at the UK box office \(73,800 admissions\) pre\-lockdown \(March 2020\). BAFTA\-winning producer Emily Morgan \[T4\] said that working with SICL on *Make Up* *“greatly enhanced the scope of our production process in Cornwall.”* Filmmaker Steve Sullivan, who directed the SICL supported feature documentary *Being Frank: The Chris Sievey Story* \(2018\) claimed *“Working with \[The Lab\] significantly benefited my approach to narrative and post\-production \[…\] and I have no doubt that without this collaboration I would not have made a feature film with the narrative rigour or finished technical quality to have had a World Premiere at SXSW in Austin, Texas or for it to have been released as a theatrical cinema film across the U.K.”* \[T11\] 

 **Impact on the Development of Cornwall’s Creative Economy** 

 The Cornish Public Service Broadcaster’s report \[RO2\] highlights that Cornwall’s representation on screen has been limited to being seen as England’s exotic ‘other’ and in predominant usage of coastal scenes, in ways which have contributed to its longstanding reliance on a tourism economy. As stated in the report; “ *To challenge the persisting, colonial ‘outsider’ view of Cornwall, a rebalancing is required, in terms of indigenous production. Access to meaningful, self\-produced representation\[…..\] which proceeds from setting editorial policy, through commissioning, to supply chain, creative talent and production entities, requires investment on an appropriate scale…”.* 

 The interventions made by SICL have ensured that a robust and diverse slate of Cornish film production has been made possible in the past decade. The success of *Bait* highlights the quality of film work being produced in Cornwall and SICL sits at the heart of Cornish film culture through \(co\) production of a number of short and feature films. As Director of Screen Cornwall, Laura Giles says “t *he Sound / Image Cinema Lab is an important bridge between the excellent academic set\-up at Falmouth University's School of Film & Television and the realities of industry financing and production. For Screen Cornwall, being able to work with the impressive students & graduates across all roles through the productions the lab is involved with is vital to developing the talent pipeline for the Cornish screen sector*.” 

 When discussing the release of the SICL supported *Brown Willy,* producer Simon Harvey says *“Brown Willy had an unprecedented \(at the time, pre Bait\) Southwest Cinema release playing for six weeks at the local cinema chain, WTW \(Truro, Newquay, Wadebridge and St Austell\). Truro and Wadebridge were our most successful venues \- with the film playing solidly in Truro and repeatedly in Wadebridge for approximately 84 screenings. The film also had 4 sell out screenings at the Newlyn Picture house and 3 sell out screenings at The Poly in Falmouth and runs in both Redruth and Penzance cinemas.  Approximately 21 screenings. The film screened outside of Cornwall in Exeter, Warwick, Leeds, Bristol \(The Watershed\), Torrington and the Clapham Picture House, London \[6 screenings\] and in the summer of 2016 \- the film \(which was marketed entirely by ourselves with zero budget\) broke into the UK’s Box Office Top Fifty Box Office.” \[T5\]* 

 **Impact on Cinema Audiences** 

 *Bait* played to over 10,000 audiences at 30\+ international festivals, winning 8 awards. It won the 2020 BAFTA for outstanding debut film and was also nominated in the Best British Film category. Mark Kermode declared in *The Guardian* that *Bait* is *""a genuine modern masterpiece, one of the defining British films of the decade.”* ‘ *Wilderness’* played to over 2,000 people at 17 festivals and events, winning 12 awards along the way and receiving excellent critical reviews including “Life as jazz. Cinema as bebop” \( *The Sunday Times*\).  In addition, *Backwoods* and *Hard, Cracked the Wind* played to over 1,500 audiences at 15\+ festivals internationally, winning 2 awards. As one audience member said following the *Backwoods* 2020 UK Premiere *“This was my favourite film at LSFF this year”* \[London Short Film Festival\]. 

 The interventions of SICL have also included exhibition support, ensuring that the short and feature films produced in Cornwall can be submitted to international film festivals and that those involved \- staff, students, graduates can travel to the events to deliver the work and support the independent film culture that SICL represents. SICL has enabled supported films to be enjoyed by audiences at international festivals around the world including the Berlinale \(Germany\), Cinequest \(San Jose, USA\), London Short Film Festival, Encounters \(Bristol\), Aesthetica \(York\), New Directors New Films \(New York, USA\), SXSW \(Austin, USA\), Oberhausen \(Germany\), Cambridge \(UK\) and many other prestigious global events. 

 **Impact on Graduate Career Development** 

 There were 41 graduates \(including *Backwoods* – 5, *Hard, Cracked the Wind* – 7\) that benefited from opportunities to evolve skills learned on their undergraduate degree, get screen credits and paid work in their chosen specialism, as well as accelerated professional opportunities. *Bait*, *Backwoods* and *Make Up* employed early career graduates that were recruited through SICL in a variety of key roles. For Faith Glenister \[T6\] the experience *“accelerated my career in the film industry”*. Similarly, for Natalys Wilcox \[T7\] who used the experience to help *“get a job in film exhibition”* and also successfully applied for funding *“from Screen Cornwall, Falmouth University and the BFI to direct my own short film.”* 

 **Impact on Student Development** 

 There were 173 students \(including ‘ *Wilderness’* – 30, *Bait* – 20\) that benefited from learning opportunities that provided invaluable experience leading to accelerated professional opportunities, career development and greater attainment. Stine Tøndelstrand \[T8\] said of working with professional editor Steven Worsley on ‘ *Wilderness’,* *“it is great to be able to work with someone who is professional and get the chance to ask questions that pop up during the project.”* Professional editor Steven Worsley \[T9\] \[‘ *Wilderness’*\] said in response *“the students assigned to the editorial department really engaged with the process, gaining experience that doesn’t usually occur within the confines of an educational establishment.”* 

 SICL projects increased Falmouth University film students’ awareness of film production cultures and practices that directly impacted their studies. Josh Bransgrove \[T10\] said *“working side by side with industry professionals and having the opportunity to observe how a professional set is run \[…\] early in my university career boosted my confidence and allowed me to run my own sets to a similar standard, which in turn allowed me to pass the knowledge I had learnt onto my peers”*. Each film discussed here also held at least one on campus masterclass for film students and staff, with audiences totalling approximately 1,000 participants. 

 **Awards** 

 *Bait* won 9 awards including a prestigious BAFTA Film Awards 2020 for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director, or Producer, and was also nominated for the Outstanding British Film of the Year award.  *‘Wilderness’* has won 12 awards including Best Actress at Oaxaca \(Mexico\) and Southampton \(UK\) Film Festivals, Best Screenwriter at Chain NYC \(US\) and Västerås \(Sweden\) Film Festivals, Best International Feature Film at Chain NYC and Västerås Film Festivals, and Best Production at Goddess on the Throne Film Festival \(Kosovo\). Also, productions *Backwoods* and *Hard Cracked the Wind* supported by SICL, won 2 awards including the HP Lovecraft Award for *Backwoods* at the Flickers Rhode Island Film Festival in 2019. 

 In addition to the film awards mentioned above SICL itself won the Innovative Education Award at the University Industry Innovation Network \(2020\).  The award recognises the innovative approach to filmmaking and film teaching that makes SICL unique. Additionally, Dr Neil Fox was individually recognised as a ‘ *boundary\-spanning champion’* at the awards ceremony for his innovative approach to the relationship between industry and academia.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study describes how training practices for interpreters and psychotherapists working in the NHS, private therapy and the voluntary sector have improved, enabling psychotherapists to more effectively and compassionately treat vulnerable patients who do not have English as their first language. Some of the most vulnerable members of society have been reached; asylum seekers and refugees are especially vulnerable and in need of this support and care, in addition to NHS and counselling service users, the voluntary sector, Migration and Domestic Violence Services, Probation and Social Services, Charities, and small NGOs. As a consequence of this training, therapists report higher levels of confidence and understanding, and patients report higher levels of satisfaction. The approach has been endorsed by the UK government and its model has been integrated into NHS mental health services, resulting in easier access to services for speakers of non\-English languages. 

 Training for the British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapists has informed training in higher and further education settings and shaped the work of numerous small and voluntary sector organisations offering psychotherapy and counselling. Free online training resources have benefited small organizations that could not otherwise afford to train staff. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Jean\-Marc Dewaele’s book, *Emotions in Multiple Languages* \(A\), demonstrated that multilinguals’ first language\(s\) **\(L1\) have more emotional resonance** than foreign languages \(LX\) and that L1\(s\) are typically preferred to communicate emotions even after the LX\(s\) have become the preferred language, which happens after affective socialisation in the LX. One consequence of this is **the detachment effect,** which may cause multilingual people to feel emotionally inauthentic when speaking in LX, but also conversely that using LX can also allow them to disclose **and process trauma** that would be simply too painful to discuss in their L1. **Code\-switching** \(switching between languages\) was also found to be linked to raised emotionality in interactions. 

 After reading *Emotions in Multiple Languages,* Beverley Costa, CEO and clinical director of Mothertongue, approached Dewaele to undertake research on multilingualism and emotions in the context of mental health. Costa subsequently became an Honorary Research Fellow. 

 Dewaele and Costa’s collaborative and cross\-disciplinary mixed\-methods research examined the problems facing both therapists and patients who were English LX users \(Costa & Dewaele, 2012 \(B\), 2019\(E\); Dewaele & Costa, 2013 \(C\); Rolland et al., 2017, 2020\) \(D, F\). The research was the first to collect quantitative and qualitative data from over one hundred therapists and multilingual patients and thus marked a departure from the traditional case studies in the field. Statistical analyses and thematic analyses of interview data revealed that patients who are LX users in English may feel alienated when therapists ignore their multilingualism and multiculturalism which are a central part of their identity and do not allow them to bring their L1 in the room when needed. 

 Research into multilingualism and therapy suggest that multilingual clients are different from monolingual clients \(A; C; D; F\). More specifically, they feel they have a different identity in each of their languages; they may express different emotions in their different languages; they make more rational/utilitarian decisions in their LX; they can process trauma more effectively in one or other of their languages; they may only remember early memories in the language in which they were encoded. Moreover, clients appreciate when psychological therapists create a linguistically empathic space where all of their languages are welcome, where a foreign accent is not frowned upon and where multilingualism is viewed as a potential therapeutic asset rather than a problem or something to be ignored.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Costa and Dewaele’s research and its active dissemination of the main findings through clinical training has raised awareness about multilingualism **and multilingual identity as a therapeutic asset,** leading to improved practices of UK therapists dealing with LX users of English and ultimately benefiting some of the most vulnerable and traumatised groups in society. 

 New training and forms of clinical supervision have been developed as a direct result of Dewaele and Costa’s research \(A, E\). The training reinforces the importance of allowing the clients’ languages in the therapy session, even if these are unknown to the therapist, and the realisation that this does not constitute a threat to the authority of the therapist. By allowing clients to use their full linguistic repertoire, therapists allow clients who may struggle in English to maintain their dignity and to show their multicultural identity. Finally, it emphasises the importance of recognising that language switching happens at critical emotional junctures \(A; 1\) in a session and these instances deserve particular attention. 

 2 types of training for different target groups were developed based on studies by Costa and Dewaele \(A, B, C, E, F\). The first type of session was for psychological therapy practitioners in general and focused on the assumptions of psychological therapists about their ability to work in English with a multilingual client for whom English is an LX and whether the client’s multilingualism is significant to the therapy. This training was the first time that these issues have been included in psychological training curricula. The second type of training built specifically on the findings of \(B\) and led to greater confidence in multilingual practitioners to work effectively in a language in which they have not trained. 

 The training has helped to build the confidence of practitioners to consider, for instance, incorporating a linguistic history into the assessment process; discussing linguistic privilege and power with regard to the concept of “native speakers” and foreign accents; initiating a conversation about identity and language; evaluating when, how and if to invite a client to use their different languages in the therapy room when processing trauma; and the therapeutic value of speaking in one language or another. 

 Between 2013 and 2020, Costa trained in the region of 3,640 practitioners through her support services Mothertongue and Pásalo CIC \(2\). This figure represents all of the training discussed below. The importance of these therapeutic skills should not be understated – LX clients are often extremely vulnerable; empowering them to speak in the language in which they feel safest and most comfortable is vital. Findings demonstrate that some multilingual clients may struggle to express themselves in their LX \(C\), while others feel safer to do so due to the ‘detachment effect’ of speaking in a foreign language. Each individual is unique and benefits from services that are adaptable. Although this case study broadly describes the impacts on therapists, the ultimate beneficiaries are the clients, who through Costa’s training have been empowered by their therapists to work through their emotions and trauma as individuals with unique linguistic needs. 

 **Mothertongue:** Costa established Mothertongue as a charity in 2000 to provide culturally and linguistically sensitive counselling and mental health intervention to people from black and minority communities in the languages of their choice. Costa and Dewaele’s research led to a greater awareness of and respect for Mothertongue’s culturally\-sensitive professional counselling services, and in improved training practices for interpreters and psychotherapists. A comprehensive training programme was developed for psychotherapists and counsellors working in the NHS, private therapy and the voluntary sector. Clients who used Mothertongue directly were referred by the NHS Migration and Domestic Violence Services, and by Probation and Social Services. 

 Beyond this, through Mothertongue Costa has trained therapy trainees and qualified therapists practicing in IAPT, Child and Adolescent Mental Health \(CAMH\) teams, clinical psychology, and trainees on psychotherapy training programmes \(3\), who consistently demonstrate greater confidence and understanding in working with LX clients. 

 Clinicians reported higher levels of patient satisfaction and appreciation when their multilingual identities were acknowledged and respected. 

 Mothertongue’s model of practice has now been integrated into the Berkshire NHS IAPT \(Talking Therapies\) psychotherapy services, employing Mothertongue\-trained interpreters as NHS workers, resulting in easier access to services for speakers of non\-English languages. Trust clinicians have gained invaluable insight and knowledge, enriching staff experience improving the client experience. New practice resulting from this intervention is now firmly embedded at the Trust in which senior clinicians either lead or attend supervision sessions \(4\). The frontline work of the charity Mothertongue was concluded in 2018 after the successful integration of its interpreter service and elements of its therapy model into the Trust’s Mental Health Service. 

 **Pásalo CIC:** Costa launched the Pásalo Project in 2017 as a Community Interest Company \(CIC\). A CIC is a more nimble and dynamic organisational structure than a charity; this structure suits the non\-frontline dissemination and expansion of the learning from the work that Mothertongue initiated. In 2018, Pásalo was awarded funding by the Big Lottery to provide cultural and linguistic training and supervision to small organisations which would otherwise be unable to afford the training. Spaces were filled months prior to the start date of March 2018, while requests for multilingualism in therapy training continue. 

 Practitioners working with the terminally ill and bereaved family members were trained through Pásalo to work with multilingual clients. Case workers and clinicians from five refugee organisations, working with the most traumatised members of our communities, have been trained. This model of training is easily replicated and available to the least well\-resourced workers working with a highly vulnerable client group. Due to its success, funding was awarded again in 2019, while additional funding to work with organisations in Wales was awarded, also in 2019. The impact of this model is particularly significant because of the overall lack of resource for vulnerable client groups. In 2020, Pásalo CIC was awarded funding by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation to create a free online CPD training resource on mental health and multilingualism. This includes six short films from psychological therapy with multilingual clients. The resource will ensure the widest possible reach for practitioners to work with multilingual mental health clients  [https://www.pasaloproject.org/multilingualism\-mental\-health\-and\-psychological\-therapy\-\-\-course\-content.html](https://www.pasaloproject.org/multilingualism-mental-health-and-psychological-therapy---course-content.html). 

 The Pásalo Project continues to train practitioners, including Speech and Language Therapists at the University of Reading and the Masters programme for Public Service Interpreters at the University of Alcalá, Spain. In 2020, Pásalo created an e\-learning resource for the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy: The Social Response Cycle \- about effective therapeutically framed social action \( [https://www.bacp.co.uk/cpd/social\-response\-cycle\-member\-resource/](https://www.bacp.co.uk/cpd/social-response-cycle-member-resource/)\) \(5\). 

 The British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapists recommends that practitioners provide around 20 sessions per week with multiple clients. Assuming a thirty\-year career for each of the 3,640 practitioners who received training through Mothertongue and Pásalo, and a 48\-week working year, this equates to nearly 30,000 sessions per counsellor. For all counsellors Costa has trained, the number of sessions is in the region of one hundred million. The number of people living in the UK for whom English is a second language is around 7%, so assuming that approximately 5% of service users fall into this category, 5% of the overall sessions equates to over 5,000,000 sessions directly benefiting from Costa’s training.\* 

 These sessions often reach the most vulnerable people in society and those most in need of support, including victims of domestic abuse, refugees and asylum seekers. While it is hard to pinpoint exact numbers of those groups that have been reached, we do know that therapists have overwhelmingly benefited from Costa’s training, and that they are passing those benefits on to their clients. 

 **Bager\-Charleson:** In 2017, Sofie Bager\-Charleson \(1\) published a study with Dewaele and Costa on therapists’ experiences of undertaking awareness\-raising training about multilingualism. Analysis showed that clinicians trained to understand multilingualism consistently reported feeling more confident to work with patients’ multilingualism as a therapeutic asset in treatment. 

 Clinicians trained by Costa consistently report that the techniques developed from Dewaele and Costa’s research are helping patients to use treatment for anxiety and depression \- especially trauma \- more effectively, aiding their recovery. Indeed, Bager\-Charleson’s \(1\) evaluation of the training programme showed that it raised awareness of how ‘language is a path into “a whole world of understanding and experiences”’ and not using a client’s mother tongue limited access to their world. Bager\-Charleson’s positive assessment of Costa’s training holds true in direct feedback, too. Practitioners trained in 2018 and 2019 awarded the sessions an average score of 9.4 out of 10 for usefulness \(6\), while qualitative comments from IAPT trainees demonstrate the sessions’ impact on clinical practice: ‘I now explore with bilingual clients if they feel a greater connection \[…\] to either language and adapt language chosen’; ‘I \[now\] invite in client’s first language if they are describing past events’; ‘\[I encourage\] clients to use phrases or words from their native language’; ‘I have now negotiated with my manager to have more time to write up clinical notes in English when I have been working with a patient in Polish’. 

 **British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy \(BACP\):** Costa has delivered supervision training across the UK for BACP and has informed the work of numerous small and voluntary sector organisations offering mental health services and counselling to victims of domestic violence, asylum seekers and refugees, and parents of children in hospices. Furthermore, individuals working in these organisations received training directly from Costa \(6\). 

 **IAPT / Further and Higher Education:** Costa taught on Reading University’s IAPT training in 2018\-19 and 2019\-2020, as part of the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences PYMBAS module, covering foundation skills in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, as part of the core curriculum to trainee Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners \(PWPs\). Further sessions were delivered as part of the PWP Supervision training \(7\). Additionally, Costa has trained clinicians and trainees at further and higher education institutions; IAPT therapists and supervisors have been trained at the Universities of Southampton and East Anglia \(7, 8, 9\); trainee Clinical Psychologists at the University of Oxford; trainee Speech and Language Therapists at the University of Reading; trainee Counselling Psychologists and Psychotherapists at the Metanoia Institute; trainee clinical supervisors via the BACP; and trainee counsellors at Cardiff And Vale College. Southampton University’s Low Intensity \(LI\) CBT Programmes Group Manager attested that Costa sessions for PWPs and High Intensity Therapists \(HITs\) were considered by ‘our programme teams to be an extremely valuable and useful session \[there is\] an enormous amount of value \[…\] for the students’. Furthermore, Costa also delivered a similar session to PWPs for the Education Mental Health Practitioner \(EMHP\) training. The Group Manager noted that although it was not part of the national curriculum, the value that it added for EMHPs was indispensable \(9\). 

 Costa’s training and new resources have continued to benefit therapists into the latter part of the impact period. Early in 2020, Costa developed a new online training resource on multilingualism and mental health, that included an accompanying film, *Language of the Heart,* both of which were produced through Pásalo. The course is for therapists, counsellors, trainees, supervisors, trainers, social workers and anyone interested in mental health and multilingualism. The course takes up to 12 hours to complete and participants receive a CPD certificate for on receipt of their evaluation. Because the training is currently in its trial form it is being offered free of charge and is therefore an opportunity to achieve 12 hours of CPD for free. Although the resources were originally due to be trialled earlier in 2020, they were delayed until lockdown restrictions were lifted. Ultimately, the online resource and film were launched on 14 December 2020. In its opening week alone, 115 people accessed it and 22 completed it and sent in evaluation reports, while at the film’s initial screening 100 people attended.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Ensuring financial aid is distributed and managed effectively has remained a challenge into the 21st century, even with the development of a common framework by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \(PEFA\) Secretariat in 2010. A DMU research team, led by Fred Mear, carried out research in 2016 to analyse and evaluate the set of diagnostic tools used by governments and development partners around the world, identifying duplications and gaps, as well as the complementarity of different tools. The research has been used to create new resources for PEFA and their stakeholders, including a new typology of diagnostic tools to aid in selection and use. The findings have also informed the development of training materials, which have been delivered to European Commission \(EC\) staff and development partners from 50 different countries around the world. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Providing financial aid to developing and transitional countries has long been problematic, not least because different donor countries approached the management and monitoring of aid in different ways, creating high levels of duplication. PEFA – the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability programme – was established in 2001 as a means of harmonising the assessment of public financial management \(PFM\) across its seven international development partner organisations \(EC, International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and the governments of France, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom\). However, for the first decade of PEFA’s work, different countries were still using a wide range of diagnostic tools to assess and report on the strengths and weaknesses of PFM performance, and it was not until 2011 that international partners agreed to work towards a common framework, signalled by the Busan Partnership on aid effectiveness. As an initial step, PEFA first undertook a stocktake of existing diagnostic tools and then created a tool that could be used to look at overall performance of PFM systems. However, research was still needed to understand how far the duplication of the tools identified in the stocktake had been reduced, what new tools had been developed and how diagnostic tools related to the PEFA system tool. Work carried out by the team at DMU’s Leicester Castle Business School from 2016 has shed new light on these questions. 

 Led by Mear, and drawing on his extensive expertise in PFM in developing and transitional countries, the DMU team carried out PEFA\-commissioned research to analyse the international PFM diagnostic tools used by development partners \(those who monitor the management of public finances\) around the world. The research compared diagnostic tools available in 2016 to those in use in 2010, identifying and analysing new tools and highlighting duplication and gaps in provision. The team identified 45 PFM diagnostic tools in three categories, which they used to develop a new typology of tools: broad PFM diagnostics, covering the entire PFM system; those focusing on individual elements of subsystems, such as tax administration and fiscal blueprints; and tools used to make decisions on fiduciary risk. The project found that there had been an increase in the number of tools available \(33 in 2010, 45 in 2016\) and that both the new tools and updates to existing ones had helped to fill the gaps in provision, most notably in non\-financial asset management and budget\-related performance. The team developed a methodology to capture the characteristics of each tool and how each should be used. The research also mapped the range of diagnostic tools to the seven pillars of the PEFA system tool, enabling development partners to identify appropriate options for assessing the effectiveness of the PFM system and strengthen the PFM process. The growth in tools represented both a more consistent and comprehensive methodology and a richer complexity in choosing and coordinating internationally accepted tools \[R1, R2\]. 

 This project led the team to explore the application of both PFM assessment and reporting tools in more detail in two areas. The first involved a study to codify good practices in financial reporting by sub\-Saharan African governments. The researchers audited the financial statements of a dozen governments of sub\-Saharan Africa and interviewed a range of stakeholders in each country, including senior financial government officials, civil society groups and the financial media. They then analysed the findings in relation to four broad indicative criteria – timeliness, understandability, openness and consistency – and then used the results to identify examples of good practice \[R3\]. The second study focused on China’s local government debt, examining impacts of the urban construction investment bonds introduced by the central government to increase transparency and close some of the obscure financial instruments that had been in use. The researchers found that the majority of new local government financing being used was hidden and breached comprehensiveness and transparency criteria for the management of public finances, shedding light on the risks to the solvency and financial sustainability of China’s local governments \[R4\]. 

 Further research has taken the findings from this work on PFM and applied them to theories of innovation. Werner and Mear’s research on the role of ‘hidden champions’ in German Small and Medium\-sized Enterprises \(SMEs\) explores the concept of subsidiarity and how it encourages innovation, tracking its development within Germany over the past 200 years and comparing this to the approaches taken in the UK over the same time period. The research draws on the PFM studies to test the robustness of their hypothesis that subsidiarity creates an incentive for innovation. By moving away from project\-based disbursal and monitoring mechanisms \(which involved greater micromanagement and more resources, and had the potential to cause resentment in the receiver countries\) towards the disbursal of funds to the general budget of the recipient country’s fiscal administration, the receiving countries are given the responsibility and political authority to disburse the funds on the basis of the agreement that has been made. The research suggests that this decentralised aid disbursal via budget support, combined with investment in education, training and capacity\-building, is bearing fruit. These findings also suggest that subsidiarity as a design feature of an incentive structure is likely to be a robust approach in different settings \[R5\]. This application of the work on the PFM system demonstrates the importance of the research, not only in relation to effective aid distribution and management, but also in a much broader business and innovation context.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Work by researchers at DMU has built a new body of knowledge of the international financial management diagnostic tools in use, helping Development Partners working with developing and transitioning countries to increase both their understanding and their ability to navigate the selection of the tools on offer. The research has formed the basis of capacity\-building in PFM around the world and created new resources to be used by Development Partners. 

 **BUILDING CAPACITY IN PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SKILLS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY OF EU TRAINING PROGRAMMES** 

 Drawing on previous experience of delivering PFM training, the team used their research findings to rewrite two specific courses to reflect both their work on the PFM diagnostic tools and the more detailed case studies. Both courses have been developed to increase capacity by providing the knowledge and skills to manage, plan and monitor PFM reform effectively and in negotiating and implementing budget support programmes, the default approach for delivering effective aid. Acting Head of the EU Unit for International Partnership has said that the research carried out for the PEFA Secretariat has supported the unit ‘in improving both capacity and decision\-making skills for those negotiating and implementing the PFM reform strategies as part of the Budget Support programmes… \[this\] accounted for €1.6BN of the aid given by the EU in 2019’. \[C1\] DMU research has been used to underpin the following courses: 

-  The 5\-day PFM Fundamentals training course \(4\-day online version\) developed for those involved in designing, implementing or assessing the PFM reforms, and those using diagnostic tools to assess progress. The training provides a technical introduction to the diagnostic tools identified in the 2016 DMU research and explores ways in which the tools can be used together, also drawing on case studies developed from the research. A prerequisite for anyone involved in EU PFM, 3 online sessions and 8 face\-to\-face courses have been delivered since 2017, involving a total of 254 people \(83 delegates online; 171 face\-to\-face\). as well EU regulatory institutions such as OLAF \(Anti\-corruption Office\) and EU Court of Auditors. \[C1,2\] 

-  The EU Directorate General for Development and Co\-operation 3\-day PFM Reform training course, delivered to staff from the EC headquarters and its delegations, with a focus on negotiating budget support contracts with Development Partners and national governments. The training course refers directly to the findings of the 2016 research, looking in depth at identifying weaknesses of the PFM systems and selecting and using different combinations of tools to develop a coherent reform strategy. Since reframing the material using the team’s research in 2017, the programme has been delivered to 72 delegates across 8 courses. The delegates are primarily concerned with negotiating conditionalities for Budget Support and come from a range of positions including institutions from the Directorate Generals of: Development and Co\-operation, Economics and Finance, Partner Governments and partner aid agencies. \[C1,3\] 

 Feedback from both courses has been very positive, with the majority of participants finding it either useful for their current role or helping them to prepare for future roles. Specific examples include the macro\-economist and programme officer for the EC who states that the training has helped him in two of his job roles, first in the General Directorate for Economic and Financial Affairs in Brussels and, since August 2020, as part of the EU Delegation to the Kyrgyz Republic: 

 ‘The training and the use of PFM diagnostic tools allowed me to more easily identify the weaknesses and needs of Public Financial Management systems. This knowledge and access to diagnostic tools in a clear and concise way with guidance on how to use the tools has helped in both the analysis of weaknesses and identifying reforms to prioritise in accordance with International Good Practice. The guidelines are particularly helpful in identifying the links of the multitude of diagnostic tools to the system weaknesses identified by the PEFA assessments.’ \[C4\] 

 This participant has been able to apply what he learned about the diagnostic tools to the development of conditionalities for the second and third programmes under the instrument of Macro\-Financial Assistance in Jordan, totalling EUR900,000,000 \(2017 and 2020\). In his current role as economist responsible for macroeconomic and PFM issues in the EU Delegation to the Kyrgyz Republic, he has applied the learning to monitor the authorities’ PFM reform Action Plan as adopted on 30 June 2020 in the context of ongoing budget support programmes \[C4\]. 

 The benefits of the training are mirrored by First Secretary of the Swedish Embassy in Cambodia, who attended the PFM Reform training in November 2018. She has stated that what she learned on the course has ‘helped … tremendously in \[her\] work in Cambodia’ \[C5\]. The knowledge she gained has enabled her both to carry out her role more effectively and to provide essential information to colleagues, something which she says she would have been unable to do if she had not attended the training. She states, ‘I am without doubt that the knowledge I gained during the PFM course before my deployment made my work easier and more importantly added value not only to Sweden and EU but essentially to the Cambodian efforts to reform the PFM sector in their country’ \[C5\]. 

 The application of the training and research in fragile states was endorsed by the EU attaché for Public Finance and Budget Support in Afghanistan, who stated: 

 ‘The training and the use of PFM diagnostic tools have assisted me in my role as Programme Officer for public finance management and as task manager of the EU State and Resilience Building Contract at the EU delegation to Afghanistan. The training deepened my understanding of Afghanistan’s PFM systems and particularly the diagnostics to use in assisting the fight against corruption and in designing and monitoring the implementation of budget support operations.’ \[C6\] 

 **BUILDING CAPACITY THROUGH BESPOKE TRAINING PROGRAMMES: MOLDOVA, AZERBAIJAN AND THE GAMBIA** 

 As well as training courses, Mear and colleagues have also developed and delivered bespoke support to build capacity related to using specific PFM tools in specific situations. Examples include working in Moldova on accounting legislation \(May and November 2016, drawing on the research as the initial fieldwork was being carried out\), in Azerbaijan on improving its PFM system in line with international standards \(October 2017\), and in The Gambia on rebuilding PFM on its return to democracy \(December 2018\). Training in The Gambia was attended by 28 delegates, including senior staff in the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Interior, the Gambia Office of Statistics, the Gambia National Audit Office, the Accountant General Department, the Central Bank of The Gambia, and the Office of the President. In the televised opening remarks, the Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs highlighted the importance of the training for those involved in the implementation of the reform programmes for The Gambia and the value of applying the learning to the government reforms. Feedback from the training demonstrated its importance, with participants saying it was ‘very essential and relevant to my work’ and that the experience ‘will enable my capabilities in executing my duties at work.’ \[C1,C7\] 

 **BUILDING CAPACITY IN PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SKILLS FOR CHINESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS** 

 Since 2017, Mear has also delivered training to visiting Chinese government officials. Across a total of 10 courses, 160 delegates have attended the training, aimed both at Chinese Ministry of Finance officials and at Chinese provincial government officials to support their transition to international PFM standards. Attendees have included the Deputy Director and senior staff members of the National Development and Reform Commission \(the body in charge of China's macroeconomic planning, responsible for formulating and implementing strategies for national economic and social development and coordinating major economic operations\); senior officials within the Supervision and Evaluation Bureau of China's Ministry of Finance; senior officials from the Department of International Economic Relations, Ministry of Finance; and regional delegations \(including XinXing, Guangzhou, Sichuan, Hainan and Guangxi Zhuang\) \[C8\]. 

 **CREATING NEW RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS** 

 The research commissioned by PEFA led the team to create two new resources for development partners, made available through the PEFA platform. The first, the Stocktake of PFM Diagnostic Tools 2016, provides a detailed overview of available tools, highlighting which are new and where updates have been made. The guide also creates a new typology for the tools, identifying three categories that enable a more informed choice. The annexes to the report are specifically designed to help stakeholders select and coordinate diagnostic tools, by providing an overall view, identifying complementarity of technical coverage, and providing details on the basic elements of each tool, as well as web links where available. The second resource, the much shorter Guide to PFM Diagnostic Tools, draws on the Stocktake to provide users with an outline mapping of the tools and their complementarity. These resources help development partners to apply the appropriate combination of diagnostic tools for their particular situation, which helps to identify weaknesses in the system and improve aid effectiveness \[C9\]. 

 **INFORMING THE NEXT PHASE OF PFM REFORM** 

 In 2018, Mear was appointed as the Academic Lead on the Forward\-Looking Advisory Group \(FLAG\) for the PEFA Secretariat reviewing the next phase in supporting PFM reforms. FLAG includes senior representatives from partners countries – the former Minister of Finance and Planning Ghana; the former First Deputy Minister of Finance Georgia; Ministry of Finance and Credit Columbia; and the former Minister of Economy & Finance Guinea – as well as representatives from the International Budget Partnership and the African Development Bank. Mear is the sole academic representative \[C10\]. The Advisory Group undertook technical analysis of the drafts and working papers prepared by the study team and provided expert advice to the Steering Committee on the quality, implications and use of the review findings. The PEFA Steering Committee is a high\-level committee that provides strategic direction to, and oversight of, the PEFA programme, and commissioned an analytical study to provide the Committee ‘with a common basis and to propose options to define the future PEFA program in terms of focus and scope, development of the framework, organization of the Secretariat function, and funding modalities’.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘Football and War’ has achieved impact through collaborations within museums, libraries and related institutions, within schools and in the media. By challenging the myths of the ‘Christmas Truce’ story and bringing the history of football in World War One \(WW1\) to life in children’s plays and commemorative football matches. Through access to and education about iconic artwork, supporting documentaries and public debates our work has provided powerful lessons of how people can triumph in the midst of a conflict. The resonance from this work lives on through the ‘Football Remembers’ project. Through the dialogue between young people and veterans, commemorative activities, memorial artwork and important educational tools around sport, gender and politics.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research at the University of Central Lancashire focusing on the cultural and historical aspects of association football has been conducted since the late 1990s. Since 2001 the university has collaborated with the National Football Museum \(NFM\), then based at Preston North End’s Deepdale Stadium. The International Football Institute \(IFI\) was established in 2003 as a partnership between the University of Central Lancashire and the NFM. The National Football Museum states that: **“The International Football Institute seeks to advance research on all aspects of football, and to make this research available to the widest possible audience, nationally and internationally.”** 

 Within the IFI, Hughson, Adams and Melling’s research challenges existing knowledge on the role of football in relation to war, particularly the mythological constructions that allow football to be used in an ideological way in connection with war. For example, Adams research into the well\-known 'Christmas Truce' story \[4, 5, 6\] finds that football did not effectively provide a means of battlefield détente, as is widely assumed to be the case. Rather than being a source for maintaining a patriotic spirit on the Front, football, more routinely, was found to have provided a recreational means for soldiers to have some exercise and take their minds off the dangers and horrors they experienced and witnessed. Similarly, Adam’s and Hughson’s research into the painting *Gassed* \[3\] found that the artist John Singer Sargent, by depicting a football match in the background, was representing in paint what he observed occurring as leisure time on the Front, rather than making a moral statement about the symbiosis of war and football. While the painter C. R. W. Nevinson was making a critical commentary about football averting the attention of the citizenry from an impending Second World War, Hughson’s research shows that Nevinson’s painting *Any Wintry Afternoon in England* \[2\] has been more generally received as a depiction of the cultural significance of football to quotidian life in industrial and urban communities. 

 Melling’s research on the Dick Kerr Ladies football team \[1\] is largely concerned with dispelling the view that women players were passive social actors who accepted terms for playing football that were served up to them. While circumstances, obviously enough, were significant to what could be done, the women were dynamic actors who, while playing their part in the war effort, used the time to engage in a form of organised sporting activity from which they had previously been excluded. As in the case of the male participants studied in the research of Adams and Hughson, Melling’s research on women players shows how the human enthusiasm to enjoy football has prevailed under the extremely difficult circumstance of both battlefield and war occurring as a backdrop to life.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 A key driver of the impact has been the relationship between the University of Central Lancashire’s International Football Institute and the National Football Museum \(NFM\) \[A\]. This applies especially to the impact related activities of Adams and Hughson. Dr Adams’s main direct impact activity in connection with the National Football Museum was in a consultancy capacity to the major exhibition *The Greater Game: Football & the First World War* \(19 December 2014 – 13 September 2015\) \[B\]. In this capacity, Adams consulted on potential artefacts and delivered a workshop to the staff before the NFM major exhibition. Several of the exhibition cases carried quotes and information attributed to Adams and a quote from him was writ large on the wall above the section dedicated to the Christmas Truces. He was individually mentioned on the acknowledgements board at the exit of the exhibition. His research was used to inform the publication, *The Greater Game: A History of Football in World War I* \(Oxford, Shire Publications, 2014\), which accompanied the exhibition. Furthermore, Adams wrote a play, titled *A Game for Christmas*, which has been used as a teaching resource in primary schools at no cost. The play was made available to schools via Learning and Resources pages of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission website and the resources website of the National Children's Football Alliance \(NCFA\) \[C\]. It was also performed, several times, at the National Football Museum during *The Greater Game: Football & the First World War* exhibition. The play was also performed in a radio version during the two\-week ‘Celebrate Sport’ event, which was held by the BBC at Media City UK. This radio version of *A Game for Christmas* was recorded and disseminated to schools. HRH The Duke of Cambridge, a supporter of the project, remarked: 

 **“We all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms on Christmas Day, and it remains wholly relevant today as a message of hope over adversity, even in the bleakest of times.” \[C\]** 

 Adams’s research \[3\-6\] has also been used in other broadcast and print media, public talks and events, to disseminate knowledge to the general public and specialist audiences in promoting discussion and debate about football during WWI. Broadcast media include BBC World Service \(global listenership of 150 million per week\) *Sportshour* programme and podcast \[D\], BBC Radio Lancashire’s *Drive Time*, BBC Radio 5 Live’s *The Daily Interview,* and *Radio Hochstift* in Sennelager, Germany. Adams’s research has been cited in numerous British national and local newspapers as well as the international media \(e.g. *The Times, The Independent, The Telegraph* and *The Daily Mail, The Warrington Guardian*\). A number of public and specialist talks have been delivered including five at the National Football Museum. Adams gave two public talks at The National Archives, Kew \(available by podcast\) \[E, F\] and presented a paper at the Ministry of Information Press Centre in Belgrade, Serbia. On 9 December 2014, Adams delivered the ‘Daily Briefing’ to the officers of the 20<sup>th</sup> Armoured Infantry Brigade at Sennelager before the playing of a commemorative football game. In other school related activities, Adams conducted workshops and gave presentations at several local schools, including Cheetham Primary School, Manchester \(19 November 2014\) and John Cross Primary School, Bilsborrow \(24 February 2015\). 

 Adams was invited to appear at the *BBC World War One: The Home Front* roadshow at Blackpool and Blackburn on the 21 and 24 June 2014. The BBC estimated the audiences across the two days at approximately 3,000 people. Adams was a contributing consultant historian to the British Library on the WWI pan\-European ‘Europeana 1914\-1918’ project. He was also a contributing historian on the British Council/Premier League/FA ‘Football Remembers’ project \[G\]. In relation to this project, an education pack was developed and distributed to 30,000 British schools and mass participation events were organised by the British Embassy network around the world. Adams consulted on the staging of a centennial commemorative football game between British and German army units at Sennelager, Germany in December 2014. The game was attended by thousands of soldiers from both armies and several thousand civilians. Each spectator was given a souvenir programme, which included a page overview authored by Adams about how and why football was played in ‘no man’s land’ on the Front during Christmas of 1914. This page was provided in both English and German. 

 The Football Association \(The FA\) invited sculptor Andrew Edwards to create a monument to mark the occasion \[H\]. Edwards approached the National Football Museum for information about the football played on the Front by the troops in 1914 and Adams was, in turn, invited to consult Edwards on preparation of the art item. A full size bronze was unveiled on 22 December 2015 in Messines Town Square, Belgium on a site identified by Adams as in close proximity to a possible game of football between the 6/Cheshires and their German opponents as briefly described in Lt. Brockbank’s diary exhibited at *The Greater Game: Football & the First World War*. A modified resin full\-size statue was displayed at St Luke’s \(“The Bombed\-Out Church”\) in Liverpool from December 14 to 21, 2014 and then at the Christmas Carol Concert at the Anglican Cathedral in Liverpool. Internationally, the resin statue was also displayed on the site of the former truce in no man’s land in Belgium on Christmas Day 2014, and the following day at the Menin Gate Memorial in Ypres, Belgium \[I\]. It was also shown at several football grounds to raise awareness and funds for a permanent memorial. The ‘Football Remembers’ project has impacted WW1 veteran football players and young academy footballers through the veterans sharing their experiences of the war and football during the war \[G\]. 

 As Director of the International Football Institute, Professor Hughson has worked closely with the National Football Museum to ensure the museums interpretations are accessible and appealing whilst being informed by high level curatorial scholarship and expertise \[J\].  Hughson drew on his published research \[2\] on the painting *Any Wintry Afternoon in England* by the British artist C.R.W. Nevinson to advise the National Football Museum to seek a loan of the artwork from its owning institution, the Manchester City Art Gallery. Accordingly, Hughson was involved in discussions regarding the loan with senior staff at both the National Football Museum and the Manchester City Art Gallery. The loan went ahead, and the painting was displayed at the National Football Museum, with key object status, from October 2013 to October 2014. While the painting was on display at the National Football Museum, Hughson gave a number of presentations to the public and provided expert commentary in an educational video made in situ at the National Football Museum in front of the painting. This video was made available as an educational resource to schools. Hughson’s discussion addressed the ‘football and war’ theme regarding Nevinson’s intention in the painting and in regard to subsequent interpretations of the artwork. 

 Melling's research from the 1990s to the present day on the Dick, Kerr Ladies \[1\] football team informed the 2017 Channel 4 television documentary, ‘When Football Banned Women’, presented by broadcaster Clare Balding \[K, L\]. By collaborating with the acclaimed and award\-winning Lambert Productions, Channel 4, Jean Williams, Gail Newsham, and Clare Balding CBE, Professor Melling was able to bring the debate over the 1921 FA ban on women’s football into the wider public domain. ‘When Football Banned Women’ received 500,000 ‘hits’ on the first night of screening, and many more via playback, social media, and the national press. Balding noted, during her narration of the documentary, that many of the young women players today had no concept of the game’s history or the struggles their predecessors experienced. This media collaboration therefore acts not only as a vehicle of information, but also as an important tool of informal education around sport, gender and politics. Furthermore, the documentary utilises Melling’s research in understanding the political connotations associated with the FA’s ban on women’s football, highlighting the change of women’s football from fundraising for charities to supporting war\-wounded families to focusing on supporting the striking miners. Women’s football and sport journalist, Suzanne Wrack highlights that **“With the war over, their fundraising turned to support for workers in struggle, and in particular for the striking miners. “You had women playing football and striking miners, and huge crowds watching them. The whole thing was revolutionary,” says Dr Melling”** \[M\].  Wrack describes the documentary as **“Inspiring, moving and analytical.”** \[M\] In May 2019, the British Library hosted a screening of the documentary, followed by a public debate chaired by Clare Balding \[L\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The development of two non\-animal multi\-cellular 3D models and the application of Mass Spectrometry Imaging \(MSI\) has provided a commercial alternative to pre\-clinical testing using animal models. Research with Innovenn UK Ltd led to a modified version of the Human Skin Equivalent \(Labskin\) product, expanding market reach into the wound care and cosmetics sector. Development with Precision for Medicine \(UK Labs\) Ltd resulted in the commercial launch of a cancer model \(PhaseZero® 3D Oncology OrganDot<sup>TM</sup>\). Uptake of MSI with 3D models by AstraZeneca and CRODA has changed their practice, produced cost savings and increased customer demand. This new model enables the 3Rs Agenda to be put into practice. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The principles of the 3Rs \(replacement, reduction and refinement\) provide a framework for performing more humane animal research; these are embedded in national and international legislation and regulations on the use of animals in scientific procedures. Opinion polls of public attitudes show that support for animal research is conditional on the 3Rs being put into practice. As well as ethical considerations, animals are expensive. Reduction and replacement of animals will reduce cost and increase competitiveness for companies that adopt these procedures fulfilling industry commitment to more sustainable innovation, meeting public expectations and customer demands. There is widespread interest by pharmaceutical industries in the use of 3D cell culture models, which mimic the biological microenvironment of tissues, as a commercial alternative to research using animal models in pre\-clinical drug development. 

 Research was undertaken at SHU in collaboration with industry using the application of mass spectrometry imaging \(MSI\) to 3D in vitro human tissue models as a valid approach for investigating both pre\-clinical drug absorption in skin \(pharmacokinetic \(PK\) studies\) and complex interactions between the drug and the human body \(pharmacodynamics \(PD\) studies\). MSI can visualize the distribution of multiple compounds within tissues simultaneously and in a label‐free manner, making MSI fast and relatively inexpensive. Two non\-animal models were used; a novel tumour spheroid model developed at SHU and a commercial 3D human skin construct or Living skin Equivalent \(LSE\). 

 Clench was the first to apply MSI to PK and PD studies of drugs, metabolites, and changes to lipid profiles in a commercial LSE model. Working with CRODA, Clench demonstrated quantitative MSI as a method to determine the amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient in skin and associated responses \( **R1**\). Research was developed further \(Cole, Smith, Cross, Clench\) with Labskin \( **G1**\) and reported the MSI of an LSE model modified to represent a diseased state \(skin condition psoriasis\) \( **R2**\) and through a KTP with Clench and Innovenn \( **G2**\), examined its value as a platform for wound\-healing studies \( **R3**\). These projects revealed that absolute quantification of drugs in the LSE model by MSI was possible \( **R1**\) and that pathways of wound healing in the LSE could be studied by changes on the metabolome of the LSE \( **R3**\) demonstrating this methodology as an alternative to testing using animal models to represent human tumours and skin. 

 Cross developed 3D tumour spheroid models in Alginate gel scaffolds for Multiple Myeloma and Osteosarcoma cancers and demonstrated efficacy for biopharmaceutical drugs in 3D cell cultures \( **R4**\). In collaboration with Precision for Medicine \( **G3**\) Cross developed the company’s existing OrganDot 3D cell culture system from a non\-tumour pancreatic Islet model, into a PhaseZero® 3D Oncology OrganDot<sup>TM</sup> model and validated this against SHU's Alginate\-based 3D cell culture system. The 3D Oncology OrganDot<sup>TM</sup> was comparable in most chemotherapy regimens using cell lines, and superior to 3D cell culture models using fresh tumour material. Clench and Cross further developed the Alginate\-based model to quantify drug distribution and response to therapy in Osteosarcoma. This proof‐of‐principle study \( **R5**\) \(Smith, Cole, Le Maitre, Clench, Cross\) showed that chemotherapy‐induced changes in metabolite abundance and distribution can be determined in 3D cell culture by MSI, highlighting this method as a tool in the elucidation of chemotherapy responses as an alternative to in vivo testing. In collaboration with AstraZeneca, Clench, Cross and Cole applied advanced imaging techniques to undertake in\-depth phenotyping of a novel aggregated tumour model improving understanding of the molecular activity within a 3D cell culture tumour microenvironment, highlighting this as a potential methodology for in vitro applications of biomedical research and pharmaceutical development \( **R6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

#  1. New product development for commercial application and contribution to the 3R agenda 

##  Skin model 

 The increase in the incidence of chronic wounds across the globe, and the lack of innovation in wound care research and development, has created a demand for an in vitro testing platform to improve wound care testing. There was a clear market gap for testing the effectiveness of products designed to promote healing in a pre\-clinical setting. Innovenn UK Ltd \(operating through Labskin UK\) makes a Human Skin Equivalent product known as Labskin, which is used to offer testing services on topical products, particularly those affecting skin microflora. Services are provided for skincare, healthcare, pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cosmetic industry to test and validate their product claims on full thickness human skin in a real\-world environment. 

 Research conducted by SHU in collaboration with Innovenn \( **R3**; **G2**\) has led to the further development of their 3D skin models, in particular, the development of a new modified version of the Labskin product ‘Woundskin’ \( **E1**\). Woundskin provides a platform for the testing of wound healing products and other medical devices without having to use animals, fulfilling company commitment to the 3Rs being put into practice. The Managing Director of Innovenn confirms the success of this partnership, ‘ *We worked together on a particularly successful project on wound healing that led to a prize winning paper that generated lots of good publicity for the company \(as well as sales\). The success of these projects was a factor in the investment in the company made by Integumen in 2019 \[…\].Prof Clench’s work has helped to generate business for us particularly in the wound care and cosmetics sectors*’ \( **E2**\). Integumen PLC is a group of life sciences companies with specific domain expertise to lever product and business development; the Chairman’s statement \(2019\) confirms the Labskin models as one of the highlights of 2019. Revenues for the group were up 371% with contracts for Labskin clinical services \( **E3**\). Through the work of Clench Labskin are engaging with new academic customers. Prof Cooper from the University of Birmingham confirms that as a result of introductions through the SHU\-Innovenn KTP project “we were invited \(by Labskin\) to take part in the trial of the company’s Wound skin product and subsequently adopted their 3D skin model” \( **E4**\). 

##  Cancer Model 

 The demonstration of the biopharmaceutical drug efficacy in 3D cancer cell cultures using alginate scaffold by Cross led to a collaboration with Asterand Bioscience \( **G3**\) to develop a non\-animal replacement for 'patient\-derived Xenograft’ \(PDX\) models used in personalised treatment.  Asterand Bioscience was subsequently acquired by BioIVT, a leading global provider of biological products to the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies. Through this collaboration Asterand/BioIVT’s existing OrganDotTM platform was successfully developed into a commercially available PhaseZero® 3D Oncology OrganDotTM model, which was launched by BioIVT in 2019 \( **E5**\). This Oncology model was the only model tested that could reliably grow primary lung cancer cells direct from patients to achieve this aim; BioIVT expanded their OrganDotTM range to include a normal lung model based on the findings from the collaborative project with SHU. 

 In May 2020 Asterand/BioIVT was acquired by Precision for Medicine \(UK Labs\) Ltd; the Senior Vice President of the company confirms that “our Innovate UK funded project led to the commercial release of the organ Dot model in 2019…our work with Dr Cross has helped raise our profile as an organisation that is able to support oncology R&D with human in\-vitro based pharmacological relevant models supporting NC3R principles” \( **E6**\). Public support for animal research is conditional on the 3Rs being put into practice. The use of human\-based solutions to accelerate the identification/validation of drug targets and enhance the selection of drug candidates with increased likelihood of clinical success contributes to the 3R agenda. For example, if a single dose of chemotherapy is tested in vivo using a mouse PDX system, 8\-12 tumour\-bearing mice per dose are required. Because up to four in vivo transfers of tumour material are needed to produce enough tumour\-bearing mice, up to 50 mice in total are needed to test the chemotherapy for a single patient.  No mice are needed if the Oncology OrganDotTM system is used. 

#  2. Knowledge transfer and change in industrial practice 

 In the pharmaceutical industry cost is a key driver and, in many respects, shapes the capital, revenue and resource decisions made during the drug discovery process. Combining the use of a 3D solid tumour model with mass spectrometry imaging \(MSI\), developed by Clench, is providing a label\-free methodology for drug discovery studies and is a viable non\-animal alternative to animal testing. Collaboration with industry partners has enabled efficient knowledge transfer of this methodology, with direct benefits to these businesses through raised awareness, changes to their practice, and produced cost savings. 

 Cross and Clench developed the Alginate\-based 'aggregoid' macro\-3D cell culture model to quantify drug distribution and response to therapy in Osteosarcoma when used in conjunction with mass spectrometry imaging \( **R5**\). This model has been employed by AstraZeneca \(a global pharmaceutical company\) in combination with MSI through a collaborative PhD studentship with SHU on the use of aggregoids for the study of biotherapeutics in non\-small cell lung cancer \(NSCLC\) \( **R6**\). The group’s Director confirms that this work ‘has raised awareness of the potential MSI has when used in combination with 3D models, which is an area of increasing interest and demand for us’ \( **E7**\). As a science\-led organisation AstraZeneca places particular value on collaborations \( **E7**\) and the transfer of knowledge from academic to industry has been facilitated by members of AstraZeneca completing part\-time doctorates at SHU. 

 CRODA, an international speciality chemical company, has supported 3 PhD students at SHU who have spent time at both UK and US sites to transfer methodologies to the company. The collaboration has developed the MSI methodology with their 3D models of skin, gastrointestinal tract, seeds and plants. Outcomes from the research have been published in joint papers and the projects been featured in CRODA publications, seminars and for staff training purposes. This has led to raised awareness within CRODA of MSI’s potential as a methodology and there is an increasing interest/demand for its use within the company with resulting business efficiencies and a competitive advantage. CRODA’s Research & Technology Director confirms that ‘using MSI saves the company time and money in studying compound distribution in both plant and animal tissue’ \( **E8**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 There has been a rise, globally, in investors’ engagement with companies about environmental, social and governance \(ESG\) issues. Yet little is known about how ESG engagement creates value. To address this gap City, with the United Nations–backed Principles for Responsible Investment \(UN\-PRI\) \- a 3,000\-member organisation, with $103.4 trillion assets under management \- developed a novel framework that provided guidance for enhancing understanding and communication of ESG and pathways for promoting sustainability within, and between, corporations and investment firms. This framework was embedded into industry guidelines and adopted by the PRI and leading investors, such as USB, when re\-organising and up\-skilling teams dedicated to ESG and communicating its benefits to stakeholders.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 ESG engagement has become a prominent practice in the field of investment management. Regulators, financial associations and leading institutional investors \(e.g. Aviva Investment\) and service providers \(e.g. Sustainalytics\) endorse ESG engagement by devising policies focussed on sustainability. They also encourage investors, themselves included, to be more active owners of the companies in which they invest in order to stimulate the adoption of ESG\-focussed practices. Earlier quantitative studies show that \- when successful \- ESG engagement can generate positive financial returns. However, there is little research on ESG engagement practices and the mechanisms by which they create value for the investment value\-chain \(corporations, asset managers/owners, financial service providers and pensioners\). This has been due, largely, to the difficulty of accessing confidential engagement data and to the qualitative nature of engagement. To address this pervasive knowledge gap, Prof. Gond led a research team, including Prof. Furnari \(City\), Dr. Slager \(Groningen University Business School\), Dr. O’Sullivan \(Sustainalytics until 12/2016, Nottingham University Business School since then\), Dr. Mosonyi \(City, 09/2014\-09/2019\), and Dr. Homanen \(City, 08/2015\-07/2019\) during 10/2015\-10/2020. This research provided insights into how institutional investors’ dialogue with companies on ESG issues created value for both investors and corporations \(3.2, 3.3\). 

 Leveraging unique access to qualitative data obtained through strategic partnerships with the UN\-PRI and Sustainalytics \- both of which commissioned projects to evaluate how engagement creates value \(3.1\) \- Gond et al. achieved their aims through two strategies: Firstly, overlaying a broader theoretical approach to value\-creation using knowledge management theory and qualitative methods, the team assembled a unique perspective on how ESG engagement creates different types of value for different stakeholders; Secondly, they adopted a multi\-method qualitative design via fuzzy\-set Qualitative Comparative Method interviews with leading asset management professionals and confidential archival data from global organisations. Although producing impactful reports for practitioners took priority \(3.2; 3.3\), the research team already has one publication \(3.4\) and has developed two papers—including one already under review in a top\-tier journal \(3.5; 3.6\). 

 The first set of outcomes was derived from 36 interviews with investors. By broadening the approach to value\-creation and focusing on practice, the researchers showed that engagement creates more than financial value. It achieves this via: ‘stewardship value’ \- by helping the fulfilment of non\-fiduciary duties in relation to clients and beneficiaries; ‘collaborative value’ \- by enabling closer collaboration between ESG and financial analysts; ‘relational value’ \- by enabling unique, long\-term relationships with executives inside firms; ‘knowledge value’ – by providing new perspectives on investee companies; ‘signalling value’\- by highlighting to corporations which ESG issues should be prioritised and ‘social and environmental value’ \- by transforming corporate sustainability policies \(3.2\). A second set of outcomes focussed on corporate\-investor interactions, based on interviews with 52 corporate actors and 66 investors \(3.3\). Informed by knowledge management theory, these took the form of theoretically novel and practically applicable frameworks, which describe how investors and corporations generate and capture communicative, knowledge and political value from their interactions during ESG engagement and as well as from pressures from ESG rating agencies \(3.3; 3.4, 3.5\). The third set of outcomes used fs\-QCA, interviews and archival data to identify which configurations of factors enhance the effectiveness of collective ESG engagement \(3.6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Creating and sharing new knowledge** 

 The consideration and integration by investors and corporations of ESG issues such as climate change or the protection of human rights are necessary conditions to shift financial markets, and global economic systems of production, towards environmental and human sustainability and to ultimately deliver the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Accordingly, the research had global reach. It raised awareness, to those within an interest in responsible investment including the asset management sector, of the role, process and value of ESG engagement. Novel insights provided by the research also changed understanding and influenced ESG engagement practices at the UN\-PRI, ESG engagement service providers as well as at major asset management firms, and, in turn, their investee companies. New frameworks and tools were provided. These enabled knowledge about how to conduct engagement, that had been ‘tacit’ previously, to become evident for consideration by executives and then applied in practice and policy. These included: \(a\) a **business case tool \(BCT\)** with which to evaluate the multiple forms of value derived from engagement by investors \(3.2\); \(b\) a **typology \(PT\)** to evaluate investors’ engagement practices \(3.2\); \(c\) a **value\-creation** **framework \(VCF\)** for mapping the communication, learning and political mechanisms by which ESG engagement creates value \(3.3\); **an illustration** of \(d\) **configurations of factors leading to un/successful collaborative engagement** \(3.6\). 

 **Shifting the understanding of how ESG engagement creates value and providing toolkits for the industry** 

 According to the CEO of PRI Gond et al.’s research “ *has helped to comprehensively: dispel common myths that often deter ESG engagement, introduce a new global perspective on active ownership policy, and alleviate the current frustrations that asset owners have regarding the voting behaviour of some of their investment managers*” \(see **5.2**\). Specifically, this impact has been delivered through interactions during various stages of the research process. The team’s industry reports \( **3.2**, **3.3**\) have been co\-produced through interactions with final users via three workshops held at The Business School \(formerly Cass\) in the heart of the City of London, and at major industry events. The core tools of our first key industry report \(BCT & PT, **3.2**\) were discussed with 65 ESG experts from the finance and consultancy industry, before being showcased during a global webinar organised by Sustainalytics for their clients about value\-creation through ESG engagement \( **5.1**, **5.3**\). The preliminary version of the second tool \(VCF, **3.2**\) was presented at The Business School \(formerly Cass\) in front of 78 ESG experts and investment professionals, and then discussed during a plenary session of the 2017 PRI\-in\-Person conference in Berlin attended by 850 investors, including major UN\-PRI signatory institutional investors \( **5.2**\). The UN\-PRI CEO statement and the electronic poll conducted before and after this session suggested that the team’s research contributed to shift the audience’s attitude towards the value of engagement and that their tool was deemed very useful in the promotion of change in the organisation of ESG engagement within investment firms \( **5.2**\). Following these presentations, Professor Gond and the team were invited to showcase their tools at eight industry events focussed on institutional investors, clients of engagement service providers, or multinational corporations \( **5.3**\). 

 The key frameworks from the researcher team’s second industry report \( **3.3**\) were included in a new set of practical guidelines & toolkits published by PRI in 2018 to encourage and guide ESG engagement in listed equities and fixed income \( **5.4**\) as well as in multiple webinars used by PRI to promote these guidelines \( **5.3**\). The introduction of the first set of widely diffused PRI guidelines noted that ‘ *successful engagement dialogue is not only correlated with positive returns on assets, but it also increases communication, learning and internal relationships for investors and companies*’. 

 **Impacting practices along the ESG engagement supply\-chain** 

 The research directly affected organisations as these tools were used to transform organisational practices of associations acting to encourage ESG engagement, ESG service providers, asset owners and asset managers, as illustrated below: 

 <ins> *Transforming</ins> <ins>the practices of</ins> <ins>A</ins><ins>ssociations</ins> <ins>Enabling</ins> <ins>ESG engagement*</ins>. The research team provided feedback to UN\-PRI on their practices to support collective engagement. The VCF tool was used to guide the reorganisation of the UN\-PRI engagement team. It also enhanced its daily work, by promoting engagement as a core skill to be nurtured and by enhancing the quality of corporate feedback on ESG engagement through a better knowledge of how companies use ESG engagement \( **5.5**\). The VCT framework is now part of the slide deck used to present the value of ESG engagement to UN\-PRI signatories. 

 <ins> *Transforming the practices of ESG</ins> <ins>engagement</ins> <ins>S</ins><ins>ervice</ins> <ins>P</ins><ins>roviders</ins>.* The tools from the first industry report \( **3.2**\) helped the research partner, Sustainalytics, to expand its range of services for ESG engagement and to develop a suite of supporting tools for its 700 institutional investor clients \( **5.1**\). Specialised ESG engagement service firms such as *A*equo used the research team’s tools \( **3.2**, **3.3**\) to engage their clients, and to document and explain the value of their services as well as to inform the training of their team of ESG engagers as well as decision making \( **5.6**\). As explained by the CEO of *A*equo “ *my team conducts constructive dialogues with companies through one\-on\-one meetings or collaborative campaigns, aimed at better understanding how they currently address challenges, and suggesting appropriate actions to improve their performance. Jean\-Pascal’s framework on company\-investor dynamics was particularly useful in providing rationales to support our decision\-making across these various dialogues*” \(see **5.6**\). 

 <ins> *Transforming the practices of Asset Owners*</ins>. NN Investment, the third largest Dutch asset owner, invited Professor Gond and his team to present their results at their premises. The industry report \#2 \( **3.3**\) has since been used by NN to reshape training activities, enhance ESG integration and promote ESG engagement by being shared with the firm’s 400 financial analysts. \( **5.7**\). According to a SRI manager at NN, report \#2 was used as a “ *pedagogical tool*” and this is been extremely useful, as ESG engagement was found “ *to be one of the most difficult topics to understand for our team of portfolio managers and analysts*” \(see **5.7**\). 

 The largest Danish pension fund, ATP, invited Professor Gond to explain to the members of the financial board how ESG engagement adds value based on his research; this meeting resulted in upgraded ESG engagement policies and enhanced ESG integration across investment practices \( **5.8**\). 

 <ins> *Transforming the practices of Asset Managers*</ins>. Finally, the VCT framework was used by leading players from the asset management industry, such as UBS Asset Management. UBS Asset Management used the frameworks to communicate the value of active ownership and reorganised its ESG team according to the PRI guidelines \( **5.9**\) whereas Hermes Asset Management, a pioneering firm in the ESG engagement space, relied on the frameworks to explain to its team and clients how engagement creates value \( **5.10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Bliesemann de Guevara’s research into how to capture community experiences of violence had a direct benefit on the activities of Nonviolent Peaceforce \(NP\) and its local partners in Myanmar. 

 NP is a global non\-profit organization which protects **civilians** in violent conflicts through unarmed strategies, working closely with local communities. It is the biggest international non\-governmental organisation \(INGO\) working on unarmed civilian protection worldwide, having trained over 800 civilian conflict monitors to\-date in Myanmar alone. 

 Knowledge about communities’ conflict experiences is essential to the work of NP. However, these communities are difficult to access in Myanmar, where mobility to and in conflict zones is government\-restricted, intra\-societal trust levels are low, and cultural and linguistic barriers hamper understanding. In response, NP Myanmar adopted a new method of engaging local communities based on Bliesemann de Guevara’s research, with positive effects on conflict knowledge and programming, strengthened local ownership of protection practices, and generation of trust and collaboration. Having been developed and successfully used in the context of Myanmar, the method was subsequently also adopted by NP Philippines.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A major challenge of international humanitarian and peacebuilding assistance has been how to develop programmes which are both context\-sensitive and needs\-based. This has been especially so in Myanmar, where a lack of access, trust and the marginalisation of local voices in conflict zones make knowledge of local contexts and needs difficult to determine. 

 Building on the research and impact agenda of the Centre for the International Politics of Knowledge at Aberystwyth, Centre director Bliesemann de Guevara’s research developed an adaptable, easily applicable method to overcome these problems in order to capture the everyday effects of violence on communities and better understand context\-specific protection needs. The research was generated in three stages. 

 First, Bliesemann de Guevara contributed to the development of *DrawingOut*, an award\-winning, metaphor\-centred drawing method. *DrawingOut* was designed to overcome tendencies in existing methods to privilege language\-proficient or highly vocal actors, to restrict participants’ agenda\-setting ability, and to limit participants’ ability to voice experiences, emotions, and cultural taboos. Specifically, Bliesemann de Guevara contributed to this development through her long\-standing research expertise in the development of alternative means of knowledge generation and local community engagement \[3.1; 3.4; 3.6\]. 

 Second, Bliesemann de Guevara adapted the *DrawingOut* method as part of the AHRC\-funded project “Raising Silent Voices”. This project explored how local knowledge of conflict\-affected communities in Myanmar can be accessed by international non\-governmental organisations \(INGOs\) to promote unarmed civilian protection \[3.5\]. Working in consultation with the INGO Nonviolent Peaceforce \(NP\), the method was developed to enable users to better capture community experiences in an open and socio\-culturally meaningful way. The method generates rich representations of how conflict and peace is understood in communities and addresses problems of access and trust prevalent in conflict\-ridden states such as Myanmar. 

 Third, the project team piloted the new drawing method in two conflict\-affected communities in Myanmar. Using the adapted version of *DrawingOut* devised by Bliesemann de Guevara, the team co\-designed bespoke research workshops with three local research associates, who delivered the workshops in Rakhine and Kachin states in May and July 2017. The project team analysed the information obtained through the new method and explored the findings’ implications for practitioner best practice \[3.2; 3.3\]. The research findings showed how capturing experiential knowledge in a more nuanced way through creative methods can make the work of INGOs such as NP more relevant to local people. They also showed the method’s usefulness in different conflict settings within Myanmar \(asymmetric warfare, communal violence\). The findings suggested that adopting *DrawingOut* would enable better engagement with local partner organisations and lead to more context\-sensitive training for community protection and peace workers.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Bliesemann de Guevara’s research had a direct beneficial impact upon the work of NP in Myanmar. 

 In Myanmar, 8.3 million people live amidst violent conflict and displacement. Knowledge about these communities’ conflict experiences is essential to the needs\-based programming of humanitarian INGOs offering unarmed protection. Gaining this knowledge is difficult, however, due to the Burmese authorities’ access restrictions, low levels of trust after decades of military dictatorship and war, and entrenched power dynamics in local communities which can lead to the marginalisation of some local voices. In consultation stage, NP Myanmar staff had raised concerns about their limited physical, linguistic and cultural access to beneficiary communities to understand conflict experiences and protection needs, and the potentially negative practical effects of this on effectively training local unarmed civilian protection actors. Adopting the methods designed through Bliesemann de Guevara’s research enabled them to address these problems in an effective manner. 

 The findings of the AHRC\-funded project were shared with NP Myanmar during meetings in Yangon between 2017 and 2019. NP staff were also trained in the use of *DrawingOut* at a workshop in Bangkok in 2019. To support the dissemination and share experiences and findings, a booklet “Like a Shady Tree in Trouble: Experiences of War and Hopes for Peace of People Living Amidst Violent Conflict in Kachin State, Myanmar” was made available digitally and as hard copy \[5.1\]. 

 *DrawingOut* was subsequently implemented by Nonviolent Peaceforce in Myanmar \(NPM\) in: 

-  the “Resilience” project, with 35 community peace workers in northern Shan state, Myanmar \[5.2; 5.3\]; 

-  project evaluations with representatives of eight Burmese civil society organisation \(CSO\) partners coordinating community protection work in Chin, Mon, Kayin, Kachin, Shan and Kayah states \[5.2\]; 

-  an NPM internal evaluation with 10 staff \[5.2\]; 

-  the “Imagine Women Leaders” project, with 80 women community leaders/multipliers across eight states of Myanmar. These women leaders subsequently used the method for peace work in their own communities, though the next project phase with a further ninety women leaders is on\-hold due to Covid\-19 restrictions \[5.4; 5.2\]. 

 Further, the successful use of the method in Myanmar led NP to also adopt it in a project evaluating the role of unarmed civilian ceasefire and conflict monitors in Mindanao, Philippines, in 2019. Similar to Myanmar, NP’s work in Mindanao was affected by access restrictions, low community trust levels after decades of violence, and a systematic marginalisation especially of women and youth. Here, the adoption of the method has to date benefitted NP’s work with 54 CSO representatives and community beneficiaries \[5.5\]. 

 The adoption of the method by NP had three main beneficial impacts on its civilian protection practices: 

####  <ins> **1.</ins> Enhancing NP’s conflict understanding and programming practice** 

 All consulted NPM staff confirmed that implementing the *DrawingOut* method enhanced the INGO’s knowledge about the violent conflicts in Myanmar by unearthing deeper, more authentic and more sensitive information more quickly \[5.6\]. NMP’s Country Director reports: ‘The advantage of getting…directly the information from the beneficiary is that you get it as it is. … \[W\]ith drawings you get that’ \[5.4\]. The Programme Director explains that the method enabled NPM staff to ask more relevant questions \[5.7\]. 

 This enhanced information gathering was enabled by the method’s ability to overcome language and cultural barriers amongst Myanmar’s ethnic groups: ‘When you’re trying to communicate with people with different ethnicity, different race, different cultural background…you will miss so much’; drawing helps ‘pick\[ing\] up issues that people don’t even know are issues’ \[5.4\]. For a Protection Officer, the method also enhanced NPM’s ability to convey conceptual meanings: ‘\[I\]n Myanmar there is no…word for resilience. \[…\] But when we draw, they get that concept’ \[5.2\]. Drawing was experienced as ‘a universal language’ \[5.2\]. 

 The method also increased the readiness and ease of NPM’s Burmese interlocutors to share information. This advantage over other methods of social inquiry was already fed back to the project’s research workshops; a participant from a violence\-affected community related: 

 ‘I had many things that I was afraid of, because of family, because of environment, because of war. \[…\] I fully participated in Yesterdays discussion and what I reflected myself was that I had never had a chance to express things inside my mind. Now I have got the chance to express \[them\]…’ \[5.8\] 

 NP staff confirmed this: ‘\[A\]rt has something that helps you to open up more, and when you’re drawing there’s…more subconscious things that come to your mind…so I think it’s easier for them to reflect’ \[5.3\]. The NPM Country Director summarises: ‘\[drawing\] really became a way for us to, to comfortably get participants to be very open and to own the information that they were sharing in a way that makes them comfortable’ \[5.4\]. Drawing was also more inclusive as it enabled sensitive experiences to be expressed: ‘\[T\]hose difficult, complicated questions that don’t have a black and white answer are really well articulated when it’s a drawing exercise’ \[5.4\]. It also enabled more open information sharing: ‘\[S\]ince the moment that we held the workshop…they’re drawing and they’re open and explaining what they are feeling, that builds trust’ \[5.3\]. 

  

 All NP staff reported that the method gave them better conflict understanding, which better tailored NP programming and practice to community contexts and needs \[5.6\]. As an NPP Project Researcher confirms, the outcome is ‘a programme that’s reflective of how people at the local community level see it to be working for them’ \[5.5\]. 

####  **2. Strengthening local ownership of protection practice** 

 The great majority of NP staff observed that the method strengthened local ownership of the peace process, improved inclusion and equality, and levelled power differentials in NP engagements with, and among, partners \[5.6\]. *DrawingOut* enabled diverse participants to set the agenda in engagements with NP and each other, which amplified marginalised voices and levelled power differentials: ‘\[T\]he person who is drawing is the lead in determining what the information \[is\] and how they want to share it’ \[5.4\]. An NPP Project Researcher confirms that participants were ‘more empowered to speak up, especially women and young people who are basically unseen and unheard in traditional Muslim societies and communities’ \[5.5\]. 

 The workshop facilitator of the original research reported that the method empowered marginalised groups. With regard to ethnic and socio\-economic differences she observed that the: ‘majority tribe could listen to minority tribe’s story, and also the educated man…had time to listen to very poor villagers…’ \[5.9\]. Confirming this, an NPM project officer relates: ‘\[T\]he refugee people, they want to speak, they want to share their stories but no one\[‘s\] there to listen \[to\] their voices. So, this drawing, when they are explaining their feeling, their emotion, they feel empowered’ \[5.2\]. 

 The method created ownership amongst those trained, which further levelled power and improved inclusion and equality amongst participants: ‘\[T\]he advantage of something like drawings…is that it is actually an enabler for the \[local\] partner to be centre…, it really makes them central to the work that we are doing’ \[5.4\]. This helped NP to better and more inclusively implement its core principle of the primacy of local actors in its protection practice \[5.3\]. 

####  **3. Enhancing trust and collaboration between diverse local partners** 

 A majority of NP staff observed that the method enhanced trust and communication between NP’s partners, which enabled new local collaborations for protection and peace \[5.6\]. 

 NPM used *DrawingOut* in trainings and workshops with partners from geographically and ethnically different, and often antagonistic, states and regions. This improved communication and inclusion and generated an ‘opening of how people communicate, human being to human being’ against a background of decades of violent conflict and military dictatorship, which gave ‘the opportunity for people to reflect and talk about \[difficult questions\] and challenge each other’ \[5.4\]. For NPM staff, ‘because of the conflict most ethnic groups, they don’t really associate for 10 years, or for 5 years. So…they don’t try trust each other. They need some time to build trust, but the drawing when they found…commonalities, there they can \[engage in\] trust building and relationship building among themselves also’ \[5.2\]. 

 Similarly, in the Philippines the *DrawingOut* method improved communication, inspiring participants ‘to listen to one another and…to build friendship…and to rebuild the connection’ \[5.5\]. An NPP Project Researcher reports: ‘sometimes when there’s conflict, when there’s war, the synergy \[between people\] breaks and it's a good process to rebuild and strengthen that connection using this methodology’ \[5.5\]. 

 By establishing trust and communication among different Burmese partners, the method enabled joint visions for change and action. The NPM Country Director reports that the method enabled participants to ‘start seeing that there’s a sense of togetherness, having similar goals, having similar needs…going through the same violations really and wanting to come up with very similar solutions to deal with that. \[…\] And then…bypassing gender or bypassing age, bypassing ethnicity, bypassing even geographical areas, how can they start working together’ \[5.4\]. 

 NP’s adoption of the method co\-developed by Bliesemann de Guevara benefitted members of conflict\-affected communities by improving NP’s work with eight partner organizations and approximately 170 multipliers among protection and peace workers, civil society organizations and beneficiaries. 

 To expand the scope and significance of these impacts, the NPM Country Director has planned to employ the method across all NPM projects, when the Covid\-19 situation allows, and considers their Burmese local partners’ new willingness for collaboration among themselves far\-reaching in terms of future protection and peace work: 

 ‘Once there’s empathy and understanding, it actually becomes the foundation on how people respond in the future. The changes may be very small, but they incrementally make a big difference...’ \[5.4\]

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Unit’s expertise in modelling/analysis of epidemics, and particularly transmission in enclosed communities, has enabled impact on both regional and national scales throughout the COVID\-19 pandemic. Their work was delivered through direct collaboration with both national and regional bodies, and to Government *via* the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) and Public Health England \(PHE\). The dominant impacts are 

1.  In March 2020, the timing of the first national lockdown was driven by the Unit’s modelling that identified a three\-day infection doubling time, displacing the previous five\-to\-six day figure; 

1.  In collaboration with the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) the COVID\-19 infection survey was developed and used to inform restriction tiering and national intervention decisions; 

1.  Modelling results shaped infection control procedures for enclosed communities \(notably in prisons and hospitals, but also care homes and schools\), and is credited with minimising outbreak risk and saving lives; 

1.  Modelling also underpinned hospital resource planning in the North West, which permitted elective non\-COVID life\-threatening work to continue, and is also credited with having saved lives.

##  **2. Underpinning research** 

 From 2015, strategic appointments to the Unit’s Statistics research theme, at the interface with the Life Sciences theme, led to the establishment of an epidemiology and public health group. Researchers from this group have been conducting epidemiological modelling research, which encompasses statistical and mathematical modelling of infectious disease dynamics, branching into public health, non\-infectious disease epidemiology, ecology, evolution and data science. 

 Notable underpinning work prior to the COVID\-19 pandemic includes **\[1\]**, in which the researchers developed a household\-based model framework and applied it to care homes, thus providing the mathematical underpinning for understanding the infection process in those enclosed communities. The careful numerical benchmarking experiments were key for guiding the trade\-off between model complexity/accuracy in the face of restricted time and computational resources \(relevant to emergency response\). This was followed by **\[2\]**, in which the researchers developed insight and a model framework for dealing with age structure in households, the prime example of epidemiologically relevant enclosed communities. 

 The combined expertise of the above\-named researchers provided a basis for the Unit’s COVID\-19 modelling group. Prior to the UK’s first national lockdown, the researchers developed an initial set of tools described in **\[3\]**, which formed the primary set of methods used by the modelling group. They include a range of statistical and mathematical models, beyond simple ‘SIR’\-type differential equation models, for analysing the early stages of an outbreak and assessing interventions. Particularly, the researchers used parameter estimation in the presence of known biases in data, and the effect of non\-pharmaceutical interventions in enclosed communities, such as households and care homes. 

 Publication **\[4\]** analysed confirmed COVID\-19 cases, deaths and hospital data to quantify epidemic growth rates from various European nations. This work describes the estimated three\-day infection doubling time at the beginning of the pandemic. Additionally, using methods developed in **\[3\]** to estimate time intervals between events from right\-censored data, the researchers identified a nine\-day delay between implementation of an intervention and its measurable effect in the hospitalisation data, which was \(at that time\) the only reliable data available *in lieu* of testing. The researchers then developed more refined time\-between\-events methods in **\[5\]**. These were used to estimate hospital length of stay, comparing results using an Accelerated Failure Time \(AFT\) survival model, a truncation corrected method \(TC\), and a multi\-state \(MS\) survival model. The latter was also implemented directly by the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust \(MFT\) and all NHS Trusts in the North West, to provide Trust\-specific length of stay and severity estimates and as a planning tool to predict bed occupancy. 

 Publication **\[6\]** highlights the challenges in interpreting established models within enclosed communities without better data \(including identifiable sub\-groups such as residents and staff\) and the larger scale interaction routes to the outside population. This approach was a key driver in the push for better quality fine\-grained data gathering, particularly in vulnerable care home communities.

##  4. Details of the impact 

###  Pathways to impact 

 Pellis and Hall are contributing members to PHE’s Joint Modelling Cell, comprising PHE employees, academics, NHS representatives and others **\[A\]**. This group is part of PHE’s Incident Response structure, and provides analyses and information to the Incident Director, as well as PHE’s Silver Command \(Chief Executive Officer\) and Gold Command \(the UK Chief Medical Officer and relevant officials from the Department of Health and Social Care, DHSC\) **\[A\]**. PHE’s Senior Medical Advisor characterises the Unit’s contribution to pandemic response, saying, “ *I cannot commend too highly the **excellent, substantial, and authoritative role of the Department of Mathematics,** **whose advice is highly trusted and valued both by ourselves in PHE and across Government**” **\[A\]**. 

 Pellis, Hall and House are members of the UK Government’s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling \(SPI\-M\), a sub\-group that provides modelling consensus to SAGE. SAGE assesses evidence alongside other scientific expertise to provide advice and recommendations directly to the UK Government. Hall is co\-chair of the SAGE Social Care Working Group \(SCWG\), has participated in SAGE itself, and is a member of the Environmental Modelling Group. House has participated in the Children’s Task and Finish Group. 

 In addition to the above pathways to national decision\-making, the Unit’s researchers worked directly with organisations such as the ONS, MFT \(an NHS Foundation Trust, which operates independently of UoM\), and Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service \(HMPPS\). 

###  National response 

 Modelling from the Unit’s researchers influenced the timing of the UK Government policy of a national ‘lockdown’ from 23 March 2020. On 20 March 2020, an analysis \(conducted by the Unit’s Pellis\) of confirmed cases and deaths from other EU nations, together with data on hospital/ICU COVID\-occupied beds from Italy, was presented to SPI\-M **\[B, C, 4\]**. This modelling work demonstrated that the time required for the number of infections to double was three days, challenging SAGE’s consensus estimates of a five\-to\-six\-day doubling time based on other groups’ analysis of data from China **\[C\]**. This analysis indicated that the UK pandemic trajectory was approximately two weeks behind Italy, at the lowest end of SAGE’s two\-to\-four\-week consensus **\[A, B, C, 4\]**, and recommended swift and aggressive interventions. The Government’s Chief Scientific Advisor \(GCSA\) says that this was “ **key evidence in the decision\-making process that led to the Government to close pubs and restaurants that same day**” **\[B\]**. 

 Further analysis by Pellis was presented to SPI\-M on 23 March 2020, which demonstrated that any effects associated with current mitigation measures would not be apparent in data until nine\-to\-ten days after their instigation **\[A, B, C, 4\]**. The GCSA clarifies the significance of this, saying, “ *With the established 3\-day doubling time, infections would have grown 8\-fold placing hospital and ICU bed projections higher than the target limits suggested by the NHS at the time. This **made it clear that decisions had to be taken immediately** \[…\] *It is hard to quantify the impact in terms of lives saved, but at the speed of growth estimated at the time, even doubling the bed availability would only have bought 3 days of reprieve. Therefore, **just a few days’ delay could have led to significantly more infections and associated deaths**, and likely added significant additional strain on the healthcare system.*” **\[B\]**. For context, there were 237 COVID\-19\-related daily deaths recorded at the point of lockdown on 24 March 2020. 

 Part of the UK Government’s strategy for monitoring the pandemic was to establish a nationwide survey of community\-based infection and behaviour – called the COVID\-19 Infection Survey – run by the ONS as part of the UK Statistics Authority. By October 2020, the survey’s scale had grown to sampling 150,000 participants per fortnight **\[D\]**. The survey’s protocol and ethical approval, as well as the content of the questionnaire and its operation was “ *set up at pace …. in collaboration with* \[the Unit’s\] *Thomas House”* **\[D\]**. The UK Statistics Authority’s National Statistician describes the Unit’s researchers’ contributions to the survey, saying they “… *played a big part in key analysis we have undertaken, bringing scientific and complex mathematical modelling knowledge to the wider work of the survey. This includes **being pivotal in the understanding of transmission within the household** and producing modelling around a secondary attack rate **which have fed into SAGE discussions around schools and occupations**. This also includes the use of machine learning techniques in order to develop analysis on symptoms of those testing positive to feed into wider discussions around how to identify COVID\-19*” **\[D\]**. 

 The analyses produced by the COVID\-19 Infection Survey have been used in many ways. These include providing up\-to\-date data on the state of the pandemic for Number 10 briefings; informing restriction tiers and national intervention decisions; assessing the effectiveness of non\-pharmaceutical interventions such as face coverings and social distancing; and advising key scientific groups such as SAGE on subjects including new COVID\-19 variants **\[D\]**. 

###  Enclosed communities 

 **\(a\) Prisons in England and Wales:** HMPPS is the Government agency responsible for overseeing the approximately 120 prisons in England and Wales, constituting around 80,000 prisoners and 50,000 staff **\[E\]**. The Unit’s researchers proactively engaged with the PHE Health and Justice team and partners in Ministry of Justice in February 2020, and were further approached by HMPPS in March and April, based on their established expertise in modelling virus incursion and transmission in enclosed groups. 

 The Unit’s researchers produced a Risk of Incursion analysis in May 2020 **\[C\]**, which provided HMPPS an improved understanding of the high degree of heterogeneity in risk across prisons \(based on their size, type, and staffing\) **\[E\]**. As HMPPS’ Public Health Advisor notes, this led to “ *our introduction of a national four\-level classification* system \[…\] *in addition to informing the development of a national framework to determine prison regimes and COVID\-secure operational delivery throughout the pandemic*”, based on population\-level epidemic scenarios performed by the Unit **\[E\]**. This work “ *has helped us make informed decisions concerning when, where and how to intervene in monitoring and controlling COVID\-19 transmission in prisons, thus making our efforts more targeted and cost\-effective, and equally **minimising the risk of outbreaks, ultimately saving lives**” **\[E\]**. 

 Further modelling from the Unit’s researchers, delivered in June 2020 **\[C\]**, on routes of incursion into prisons, used estimates in **\[4\]** \(based on methods in **\[3\]**\) to quantify how much risk can be mitigated by using ‘reverse cohorting units’ \(RCUs\) for incoming prisoners, isolating them in distinct environments before their introduction to the broader prison population **\[E\]**. This improved understanding “ *has influenced our working practices with respect to RCUs, quantifying the increased risk associated with shorter times spent in the RCU and the mitigation of risk via exit testing on leaving the RCU*”. Combined with additional PHE work, the Unit’s researchers’ work was “ **essential** in enabling HMPPS and PHE to formulate an effective testing algorithm for release of prisoners from RCU whilst balancing minimal isolation timescales and acceptable levels of risk*” **\[E\]**. 

 **\(b\) Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust:** The COVID\-19 pandemic placed a significant burden on UK hospitals. In March 2020, the UK Government chose to suspend all ‘non\-essential’ clinical services nationally to focus hospital resources on COVID\-19 care. Through their direct collaboration with MFT, the Unit’s researchers developed and fitted multiple stochastic models to help understand how COVID\-19\-infected patients progress through hospital care, the resources required for their treatment, and how in\-hospital infections spread through the enclosed community **\[F, 5\]**. 

 The Unit’s work on predicting resource requirements **\[5\]** enabled MFT’s nine hospitals and out\-of\-hospital services to plan confidently to a very precise operating model, resulting in the “ *minimum suspension of clinical services*” during the pandemic **\[F\]**. As the Joint Group Medical Director also states, “ *Your modelling has permitted Greater Manchester and other localities to manage their resources effectively by being able to plan, predict and deliver a system wide response to COVID over the past 11 months* \[March 2020 – February 2021\]” **\[F\]**. This model **\[5\]** has been used across the North West of England, and subsequently adopted “ *across other parts of the NHS*”, and its value “ *has been recognised nationally*” **\[F\]**. 

 The risk of in\-hospital cross\-infection between wards, known as nosocomial infection, has been “ *a very difficult problem to address*” for hospitals **\[F\]**. The network\-based models provided by the Unit’s researchers have helped MFT to understand how nosocomial infection occurs, and the risk factors associated with it. This has been of great value to MFT, who state, “… *through the work of your team not only have we been able to understand how to minimise cross infection* \[and\] *the implications of this for our patients… \[but also to\] …identify which sub populations are more vulnerable to cross infection*” **\[F\]**. This work allowed MFT to “… *for the first time quantify the risks associated with sharing staff between COVID and non\-COVID wards*”, providing “… *robust justification for the policy*” of compartmentalisation, which the Trust had previously adopted based on intuitive arguments **\[F\]**. The Unit’s scientific justification, “ *when presented to clinicians and nursing staff increased awareness and compliance*” **\[F\]**. 

 The Unit’s statistical model for integrating patient movements and COVID\-19 test results was of particular value to MFT, who say it “ *…not only allowed **in\-hospital outbreaks to be detected faster** but wards where the risk of an outbreak was greater could be flagged up to the Senior Surveillance Officer ahead of time*” **\[F\]**. This model provided information on which patients had potentially been exposed to COVID\-19 and should therefore be monitored **\[F\]**. MFT’s Joint Group Medical Director summarised the impact of the Unit’s work by stating, “ *I can with some certainty confirm that the work undertaken* *by* \[the Unit’s researchers\] *has **both saved lives and permitted the elective non\-COVID life\-threatening work* \[…\] **to continue for as long as possible**”** **\[F\]**. It has also meant that *“…when necessary, any reduction has been the minimum required to permit effective escalation of our response to COVID*” **\[F\]**. 

 **\(c\) Care Homes:** The COVID\-19 pandemic also placed significant pressure on the resources and capacity of the UK’s non\-hospital healthcare system. This pressure was particularly acute in social care settings, with residential care homes initially experiencing significant outbreaks of COVID\-19 and high mortality rates. In England, there are approximately 15,000 care homes with \~450,000 beds **\[G\]**. 

 From the first days of the pandemic, it was widely recognized in Government that the severe health consequences of COVID\-19 infection in older populations meant care homes were at particularly high risk **\[B, G\]**. In response to this, Hall formed a multi\-disciplinary analytics group in April 2020, which then became the SCWG sub\-group of SAGE, with Hall as co\-chair. On 9 March 2020, the Unit’s researchers submitted a paper to SPI\-M **\[C\]** that quantified the likely impact of unconstrained COVID\-19 spread in care homes, in terms of hospitalisations and deaths in hospital **\[B, G\]**. This paper pre\-empted the rapid rise in care home outbreaks and, as data from care homes began to emerge, the Unit’s researchers fit them to a bespoke model which projected the severe consequences of these outbreaks **\[G, 6\]**. As the Government’s Chief Scientific Advisor attests, “ *This work contributed to a series of policies targeted at care homes, including: interruption of visits, introduction of infection control procedures and other measures to reduce the risk of importation from staff.*” **\[G\]**. 

 The Unit’s analyses identified the increased risk associated with insufficient data from care homes. Lack of data hinders effective monitoring of the impacts of interventions in care homes, which is crucial for controlling virus spread in these high\-risk enclosed communities **\[G, 6\]**. As the Chief Scientific Advisor notes, “ *Good monitoring indicators thus can save lives and drive hypotheses about the way outbreaks occur*” **\[G\]**. Hall presented a consensus paper to SAGE on 12 May 2020 **\[C\]** on behalf of SCWG’s 30 members, containing multiple analyses and evidence from both his own **\[6\]** and other members’ work. This paper made the case for collecting better\-quality data and testing of both residents and staff within care homes **\[G, 6\]**. This resulted in several impacts associated with data curation, linkage and collection. For example, the Care Quality Commission began to provide information on deaths at individual care\-home level, and PHE to provide testing data based on postcode rather than by coarser geographical aggregation, which has been “ *…essential to monitor how hard each care home had been hit by COVID\-19 and assess transmission within care homes…*” **\[G\]**. This “ *…allowed faster identification of care home outbreaks*” **\[G\]**. Likewise, Hall and SCWG’s recommendation was that “… *if there was insufficient capacity to test all staff* and *residents weekly to focus on weekly staff testing. The policy team was therefore able to directly use this advice by assessing their realistic constraints, and rolled out a policy of weekly staff testing and monthly testing of residents*” **\[G\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In March 2020 the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization \(WHO\). That same month, King’s researchers together with ZOE Global \(a King’s spinout\) rapidly adapted a successful King’s digital health App into the COVID Symptom Study App. This was used to capture real\-time data on known and potential symptoms of COVID\-19 from residents of the UK, USA and Sweden. Endorsed by the Welsh, English and Scottish Governments, over 4,000,000 people signed up to the App in the UK, with 2,000,000 of those registering in the first two weeks it was available. Analysis of the data generated led to: 

-  The World Health Organisation, Public Health England and the UK Office for National Statistics updating their guidance on anosmia and delirium as key symptoms of COVID\-19. 

-  Identification of rate and location of new infections in real time, which informed the UK Government’s national strategy for containing infection. 

-  Identification of the symptoms and duration of Long COVID for the first time in a non\-clinical population, informing UK government policy and NICE guidelines.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Background:** Since 2018, King’s researchers leading the Wellcome funded Longitudinal Population Study with a large set of volunteers from the well\-established King’s adult twins registry \(<ins>TwinsUK</ins>\), which have pioneered the use of “digital cohort” App\-based approaches to collect detailed longitudinal datasets on diet and health from large numbers of participants, in real time, and at low cost. We applied artificial intelligence to analyse profiles of the twins and identify and predict biological responses to food. When the COVID\-19 pandemic emerged in 2020, little was known about the symptoms of the virus: King’s researchers saw an opportunity to rapidly redirect their existing technology and scientific expertise, by shifting from logging information on diet and health, to collecting daily data about potential symptoms, risk factors and consequences of COVID\-19 in real\-time. 

 **King’s researchers combined AI technology with cohort data to look at ways to improve human health through precision personalised nutrition.** Following the success of King’s work in relating health to gut microbiome differences **\(2, 3\)**, in 2018 King’s spun out Health technology company ZOE Global and set up the largest in\-depth nutrition study in the world: PREDICT.In collaboration with the Biomedical engineering department at King’s, we used AI tools to show that people respond differently to food and that these differences could be predicted using several unique physiological and metabolic variables such as microbiome diversity and glucose levels **\(1\)**. Most importantly, this breakthrough enabled us to develop App based tools to engage with the study participants in a new way, feeding back personalised insights on which foods may help that individual reduce dietary inflammation, improve gut health, and help users reach a healthy weight. 

 **Based on this underpinning research, King’s researchers responded to the COVID\-19 pandemic: with insight into how App technology could reach the wider UK population and gather daily reports on symptoms, they used AI methods on time\-series and geographical data to map the spread of disease.** In early 2020, King’s researchers designed the COVID Symptom Study App, collaborating with ZOE to put the content into a smart\-phone based platform enabling rapid dissemination. Combining information/observations drawn from the clinical experience of treating COVID\-19 patients of the team and their international network, King’s researchers designed the App to accurately target key symptoms. The App was launched on 23rd March, and between 24th March and 21st April 2020 alone, 2,450,569 UK and 168,293 US individuals began reporting symptoms through the smartphone App **\(4, 5\)**. Deepening the existing collaboration with King’s School of Engineering enabled intensive, rapid development of software to use this huge dataset to understand and map COVID\-19, and estimate national and local COVID\-19 cases based on algorithmic prediction. The App was free and widely available for any UK resident to use and by December 2020, more than 4,000,000 people were using it. Participants were asked to log daily health updates and record a wide range of risk factors, symptoms \(temperature, tiredness, coughing, breathing problems, headaches etc\), whether or not they had tested positive for the virus and if so, the treatment they received. To encourage their ongoing participation, users had access to local data, latest research, information on risk factors, local and national trends, advice and the ability to keep track of self\-isolation. King’s researchers existing skills allowed them to continue to optimise the App in real time based on feedback from participants. 

 **The COVID Symptom Study App allowed King’s researchers to identify a number of symptoms of COVID\-19.** In total, by the end of 2020 King’s researchers had contributed to 18 papers published in peer reviewed scientific journals on symptoms of COVID\-19, and their relationship to clinical outcomes, with 511 citations in less than a year. The research uncovered: 

 **Evidence that anosmia is a key symptom of COVID\-19 \(4\).** Over 2,000,000 participants had reported their potential symptoms of COVID\-19 on our App since March 2020. Among the 18,401 who had undergone a SARS\-CoV\-2 test, the proportion of participants who reported a loss of smell and taste \(also known as anosmia\) was higher in those with a positive test result \(4,668 of 7,178 individuals; 65.03%\) than in those with a negative test result \(2,436 of 11,223 participants; 21.71%\). This formed the basis of our symptom\-based predictive algorithm, which has been widely used throughout the world. 

 **Evidence that Delirium can be the only presenting sign of infection in older adults \(6\).** King’s academics conducted research on COVID\-19 by analysing the symptoms of a cohort of 322 hospitalised and 535 community\-based older adults in the UK admitted to hospital between 1 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. The sample data came from the App, logged in by the participants themselves. The study found that delirium is a presenting symptom of COVID\-19 in frail, older adults. 

 **Evidence for Long\-COVID \(7\).** King’s researchers analysed data from 4182 people with COVID\- 19 who logged their symptoms prospectively. 558 \(13.3%\) had symptoms lasting >28 days, 189 

 \(4.5%\) for >8 weeks and 95 \(2.3%\) for >12 weeks, which was significantly longer than controls who had viral symptoms but tested negative for COVID\-19. Long\-COVID was characterised by symptoms of fatigue, headache, dyspnoea, anosmia; and was more likely with increasing age, BMI and female sex, and was associated with experiencing more than five symptoms during the first week of illness. We generated a predictive model which enables identification of Long\-COVID risk groups in the first week of illness. 

 **King’s monitored the spread of infection in the UK and identified COVID\-19 hotspots \(8\).** We analysed data from 2,873,726 App users living in England and showed that this triangulated closely with later national studies by the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) and REACT \(Real\-time Assessment of Community Transmission Study\). We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R\(t\), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte\-Carlo. This enabled us to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers – ‘hotspots’ – with geographically granular estimates. We detected 15 of the 20 geographic regions with highest incidence, according to subsequent government test data. This therefore demonstrated that using real\-time data offered a route to rapidly identify emerging hotspots.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 King’s COVID Symptom Study App\-based research generated key evidence which widened the core symptoms for COVID\-19 testing, enabling contact tracing of infectious individuals world\-wide, and thus limiting spread and ultimately global deaths from the disease. Moreover, through providing critically early geographical data on predicted cases in the UK, the App enabled localised policies to reduce the spread of the virus, preventing health services from being overwhelmed. 

 **King’s App data led the WHO and the UK Government to include anosmia in official COVID\- 19 symptoms lists.** Data from our COVID\-19 Symptom Tracking App confirmed, for the first time in non\-clinical patients’, the loss of taste and smell as the most predictive symptom of COVID\-19 

 \- 10 times more so than the initial officially listed symptoms, fever or cough **\(2\)**. As a result, the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) **\(E\)** and UK Government **\(F\)** added anosmia to the official list of COVID\-19 symptoms. This increased the medical community’s diagnostic capability, and ensured the public recognised this symptom as a sign that they may have COVID and took appropriate action to protect themselves and their community. Professor Peter Byass, advisor to WHO, said **\(E.2\)**: “ *Your \[King’s\] work, particularly in relation to anosmia, was really important in informing the discussions behind this and is much appreciated.*” \[text removed for publication\], confirmed that data from the App was one of the pieces of evidence reviewed which led to anosmia being added to the official case definition symptoms list for COVID\-19 in May 2020. \[text removed for publication\] “ *As estimated by NERVTAG at the time, this will have helped pick up 93% of symptomatic cases, up from 91% previously, which may have led to significant benefit over time.*” 

 **King’s App data led the UK Government to include delirium in the official COVID\-19 symptoms list for the elderly.** The COVID Symptom Study showed that delirium \- a state of sudden confusion \- is a key symptom of COVID\-19 in older people **\(3\)**. Public Health England’s \(PHE\) Chief Medical Officer, as a result, updated its guidance, outlining the addition of delirium to the UK’s official list of COVID\-19 symptoms in the elderly, and advising doctors to test elderly people presenting with acute confusion for COVID\-19 **\(F.2\)**. This helped healthcare professionals in diagnosis, and increased awareness amongst the public and in care homes to recognise this symptom and take appropriate action to test and avoid spread. 

 **Research by King’s allowed the UK government to identify hot spots across the nation.** Thanks to the 4,200,000 people logging their symptoms and location in the App daily, the machine learning model algorithm provided information that was used by the different government bodies in England **\(F.2\)**, Wales **\(A.3\)** and Scotland **\(B.1\)**, to inform policies intended to slow rates of infection and allow health services to cope. \[text removed for publication\] *“\(…\) the App has been very useful in tracking the progress of the disease. Since March 2020, the data provided by the App has been informing SAGE advice to the UK government on COVID\-19. Research by King’s helped the UK government to identify hot spots across the nation showing the rates of infection in real time all over the UK, allowing identification of areas where rates of infection were growing rapidly. These data have also contributed to increased public awareness and facilitated better management of the disease, which has had an impact on the UK population, the NHS and COVID\-19 patients.*” 

 **King’s App data uncovered key information about Long COVID\-19 informing the approaches of NICE and the UK government.** Data from our COVID Symptom Study suggests that while most people recover from COVID\-19 within two weeks, one in ten people will suffer symptoms after three weeks, and some may suffer for months **\(6\)**. In December 2020, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) published guidelines on the management of long\-term COVID **\(G.1\)** heavily informed by King’s research. The Programme Director for NICE’s Centre for Guidelines said: “ *COVID Symptom Study data was made available to NICE at a critical moment in the development of the guideline, allowing the advisory panel to consider it when making recommendations on the identification and management of post COVID\-19 syndrome* **\(G.2\)**.” 

 Furthermore, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock confirmed: "" *The findings of the Covid Symptom Study are stark and this should be a sharp reminder to the public, including to young people, that COVID\-19 is indiscriminate and can have long\-term and potentially devastating effects* **\(H\)**."" \[text removed for publication\] added that data from the App will continue to help track the symptoms of those suffering from Long COVID, to help understand more about its course and the long\-term impact of this disease on people’s lives **\(F.2\)**. 

 **Data collected by the King’s App has continued to support the UK Government’s decision\- making on the pandemic \(D, F\).** The research conducted by King’s supported by the data from the App remains one of only ten studies that support the Government’s population surveillance programmes. These are essential to understand the rate of COVID\-19 infection, and how the virus has spread across the country. They have helped the Government assess the impact of measures taken to contain the virus, to inform current and future actions, and to develop new tests and treatments. The insight generated from the App along with data from other studies made a significant contribution in helping strengthen the government’s scientific understanding of COVID\- 19, inform their policy decisions and work across the testing programme. In August 2020, the UK government further recognised the importance of the App by awarding ZOE Global a GBP2,000,000 grant **\(I\)**. They said the App is “ *the largest public science project of its kind anywhere in the world” and that it “will help control the spread of the virus by providing vital new intelligence on the scale of local outbreaks, inform our understanding of the virus and how it affects different demographics.”* 

 **The Scottish and Welsh Governments and prominent health charities have endorsed the COVID Symptoms Study App.** The Welsh Government and NHS Wales **\(A\)** were the first to make an appeal for the public to download the App and log their data to help them understand and predict the developing situation of the disease in Wales. In April 2020, they released a press release where Welsh First Minister, Mark Drakeford, stated: “ *Having a range of evidence and data is crucial in helping us build a clear picture of how the virus is behaving and affecting everyone’s lives. Crucially this app can help us anticipate potential COVID hot spots and get our NHS services ready. I’m asking everyone in Wales to download the new COVID Symptom Tracker app, so you can help protect our workers and save lives* **\(A.1\)** *.*” The Scottish Government also encouraged people to use the App in their official social media channels which in combination reach over 543,000 people. They stated: “ *The COVID Symptom Tracker is an app, approved by Scotland’s top clinicians, designed to study the symptoms of \#coronavirus and track how it spreads. We need as many people as possible to take part including people who are feeling well* **\(B\)** *.”* Several key health charities in the UK also urged members and the general public to use the King’s App such as the British Heart Foundation, British Lung Foundation, National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, and Stand Up to Cancer **\(C\)**. 

 **Members of the public have also benefitted from using the App.** The App is free of charge and has been available since March 2020. It doesn’t just collect data, it also provides freely\- available, up to date information about COVID cases. It’s rated 4.7 out of 5 stars based on over 276,500 user ratings in the Apple **\(J.1\)** and Google Play App Store **\(J.2\)**. Anonymous reviews illustrate how well the App has been received by the public and what difference it has made in their lives while living through a pandemic. An anonymous review from April 2020 revealed **\(J.2\)**: “ *In our isolation feels like we are helping to stop the spread of COVID\-19 and the research into its spread with this app.*” Another from December 2020 stated: “ *I have used this app from the start and it's comforting to know that my entries are being recorded and used to advance the fight against COVID. It is continually developing as new information is recorded and I gain more insight from the app rather than the usual media sources* **\(J.2\)**.” 

 Reviews have also shown the difference the App has made in people with Long COVID symptoms **\(J.1\)**: “ *This app is very welcome both for its potential to enable better understanding of the illness, and for the fact that it makes those of us isolating with long term symptoms feel less alone.”* \(May 2020\) *“\(…\) for us the symptom tracker is very useful because it reveals the extent of the long\-term suffering that even a mild case of COVID\-19 can cause. Moreover in the absence of a proper response by the U.K. government this is much better than nothing.*” \(April 2020\) “ *My youngest daughter is showing signs of long COVID like myself, so this app is great for me to keep track of my symptoms and hers.”* \(November 2020\).

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Research by Nottingham academics led the pedagogical and structural innovation of the Young Entrepreneurs Scheme \(YES\), an integrative learning intervention for early career researchers \(ECRs\) to experience how to commercialise research and be inspired to explore more entrepreneurial career paths. 2089 ECRs from 88 institutions participated and an external evaluation of the scheme highlighted that YES contributed up to GBP1,800,000,000 in economic impact through participants’ salary uplifts attributed to YES. Support was provided from 400 organisations such as Royal Societies, GSK and Syngenta and more innovative career destinations were realised from the creation of drug development and sustainable energy ventures through to social enterprises addressing biodiversity and science communication. For instance, following participation in YES, drug development company Puridify subsequently raised GBP8,000,000 in investment. By contrast, a participant was motivated to build a social enterprise in Malaysia to inspire schoolchildren within science and engineering and over 40, 000 children took part in 2019.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2013 the Biotechnology Young Entrepreneurs Scheme \(YES\) was an established competitive programme for ECRs in the life sciences which provided an understanding of the commercialisation of research through experiential learning. It was co\-organised by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council \(BBSRC\), the Natural Environment Research Council \(NERC\) and the Medical Research Council \(MRC\) and led by the Haydn Green Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship \(HGI \- one of Europe’s leading centres for entrepreneurship education\). In planning for the 2013 competition the research councils posed two challenges to HGI. The first was to expand the entrepreneurial training of YES to other disciplines and encourage researchers to work across disciplines as a central aspect of their skills development. The second was to deliver the experiential education of YES at scale, with a significantly reduced cost per participant, whilst delivering the same learning outcomes concerning understanding the commercialisation of research and exploring more entrepreneurial careers. 

 Three strands of research within the HGI were incorporated into the subsequent growth plan **\[1\-4\]** and each year this plan was revisited, together with the research councils and industry sponsors including GSK and Syngenta and augmented using contemporary research **\[5,6\].** 

 The first strand was a longitudinal international study that followed academics attempting to commercialise their research, aiming to isolate the specific entrepreneurial competencies necessary to support academic entrepreneurship when controlling for variances in discipline, university support and national context **\[1\]**. This highlighted the significance of developing opportunity identification, resource acquisition and championing competencies amongst aspiring academic entrepreneurs. The development of these competencies was incorporated into the learning outcomes for the competition from 2013 onwards. 

 The second strand was an empirical pedagogical study investigating how best to develop such competencies at scale through challenge based integrative learning **\[2\]**. This integrative learning model was adapted for the 2013 competition and revised annually based upon participant feedback. 

 Subsequent empirical work **\[6\]** investigated how to increase the scale of integrative learning, whilst reducing the cost. This showed how to use online tools to encourage researchers to understand the complex systems they were attempting to change, before developing their ideas. By encouraging researchers to work virtually together in this way, with expert mentors from the different networks of commerce and industry, it was demonstrated that the subsequent venture ideas were more innovative and more sustainable. This online integrative learning model was shown to be more cost effective and scalable, especially for researchers in a non\-commercial environment. Additionally, the model was effective whilst still maintaining, and even enhancing, the learning outcomes and subsequent impact upon participants’ entrepreneurial behaviours and was therefore adopted by the programme from 2015 onwards. Ongoing empirical work interrogated the annual feedback from participants and conducted case study interviews to isolate the pedagogical practices that were most effective at nurturing long term career outcomes for science and engineering ECRs **\[7\]**. This resulted in a greater diversity of past participants being invited to the workshops and competition finals in 2019, where these role models shared candid narratives about their career journeys from ECR to entrepreneurship, finance and intellectual property law. 

 The third strand \(Mosey, Nottingham, Wright, Clarysse, Imperial\) examined how best to encourage cross disciplinary working. Empirical research highlighted the utility of encouraging researchers to address societal and industrial challenges that cannot be resolved via single disciplinary research **\[3\]**. This was built upon by an evaluation of the historical impact of YES on participating researchers’ career aspirations and subsequent career destinations **\[4\]**. This showed the efficacy of YES in providing bridging social capital where researchers can explore the possibilities for different career options. Furthermore, this exploration can be conducted with individuals from the external networks of venture capital, intellectual property protection, technology transfer and industrial research. Moreover, the study also showed that the impact of individuals from external networks to the typical university network make the most impact upon subsequent career choices if they share the disciplinary background of the participants. 

 Subsequent empirical work highlighted how successful academic entrepreneurs across different disciplinary and national contexts made much more effective use of social capital from outside the academic network to help grow their fledgling ventures when compared to those that did not do so **\[5\]**. As a result, in 2015, an increasing emphasis was placed upon encouraging participants to network with industrialists, lawyers and financiers at the events and to keep those networks active using a private linked in network \(this network had 2656 members on 26<sup>th</sup> August 2020\). Moreover, past participants who gave talks at the events were asked to explicitly share how they built and nurtured their networks to aid career development.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 2089 ECRs from 88 institutions participated in YES and, in 2015, an external evaluation of the scheme, commissioned by the BBSRC, highlighted that YES contributed up to GBP1,800,000,000 in economic impact through participants salary uplifts attributed to the programme **\[A\]**. Corporate partners GSK and Syngenta hosted workshops annually throughout the REF period at the Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst and Jealotts Hill International Research Centre respectively. Here, participants were nurtured and inspired by the combination of working on real industrial challenges, being mentored by entrepreneurs, financiers and lawyers and working in cross disciplinary teams to develop and sell a new venture based on breakthrough research.  The cumulative impact of the competition was summarised by the Director Academic Liaison at  [GSK](http://www.gsk.com/uk): *“YES is a unique intervention for early career researchers to engage with industry culminating in benefits not only for the students in relation to broadening their employability in the future but also benefits to industry in relation to knowledge exchange. We have subsequently employed a number of YES alumni”* **\[E\]**. 

 Below is an overview of each competition year, a summary of the research informed changes incorporated and examples of the subsequent impact upon participants’ career aspirations and destinations. 

 In September 2013, the Royal Society of Chemistry became sponsors of YES and the disciplinary focus of the competition expanded to include chemistry researchers working together with life scientists to realise the new competency\-based learning outcomes **\[1,3\]**. A previous YES alumnus \(2012\) inspired participants by explaining how, 5 months after taking part in YES, he founded Puridify \- a novel biotherapeutics start\-up. Between 2014 and 2017, Puridify raised over GBP8,000,000 in investment and grants and he explained the value of the YES competition to this process “It was good to make new connections…some judges faces came up again when we went for funding. Lots of world\-renowned academics and entrepreneurs devote their time for free. It’s only fair to pay this forward.” **\[A, p. 20\] \[4\]**. 

 In 2014, Alstom became sponsors and hosted a workshop to address the challenge of sustainable energy generation and distribution, attracting engineering researchers to join the programme **\[3\]**. Participation in the programme had an immediate effect upon the founder of Kinewell Energy, a software company that increases the efficiency of energy transfer from wind turbines. When interviewed in August 2019, the founder explained how taking part in YES had helped him develop Kinewell Energy, which had grown to employ 7 people and had experienced 400% turnover growth from the previous year, and had taught him about pricing services and how VC investors calculate equity valuations **\[B\]**. 

 In 2015, Unilever became sponsors and hosted a workshop to address the challenge of improved nutrition and wellbeing, thereby attracting researchers from new areas **\[3,4\]**. The value of the increasingly diverse network was illustrated by a participant, who was advised to apply to be the first employee of start\-up Cambridge Cancer Genomics by her mentor from YES **\[C\]\[4\]**. This participant was instrumental in CCG going on to raise USD4,500,000 to use AI for personalised cancer medicine.  Interviewed in 2019, she explains how YES contributed to her career, “I think YES should be mandatory\! It just helps you to be a bit more rounded and aware of other opportunities. You don’t have to want to go into business to take part; YES helps you develop the skills needed to collaborate with businesses in academia. It’s also about general life skills and takes you out of the academic bubble. YES allows you to expand your horizons.” **\[C\]**. 

 Additionally in 2015, the BBSRC commissioned a 20 year review of the impact of YES and the Chief Executive concluded that “I believe that the success and longevity of YES is the result of a genuine partnership….all aimed at the common goal of developing an entrepreneurial culture amongst researchers for the benefit of the UK economy” **\[A, p. 3\]**. This review captured the impact of YES upon the careers of past participants pursuing careers ranging from entrepreneurship to technology transfer, intellectual property law and business development. The interviewed candidates all articulated the positive impact YES had made upon their career choice and transferrable skills necessary to gain that position. The evaluation concluded that ‘the programme is financially efficient and effective in how it develops entrepreneurial skills and raises the aspirations of young scientists. Every £1 of Research Council funding is matched by £2.89 from other sources’ **\[A, p. 22\]**. 

 In 2016, new areas were pioneered leading to a record number of 520 participants taking part. Proctor and Gamble joined the competition with a workshop based in Singapore looking at health and wellbeing in the Asian context and this interaction was enabled by the introduction of online blended learning for the first time **\[6\]**. The briefing session for all participants was conducted via an interactive webinar and a series of online mentoring sessions were held via a private linked\-in forum. In this way, all participants could make use of remotely distributed expert help and advice prior to arriving at their respective workshops **\[5,6\]**. The burgeoning cross disciplinary expansion of YES was typified by a team that took part in 2017, with backgrounds in electronics as well as materials engineering, aeronautical mechanics and electro\-chemistry **\[3\]**. Taking part supported one member of the team in starting up a new business in 2018 to develop an online three\-dimensional multispectral crop analysis tool. Between 2017 and 2019, the business raised GBP400,000 in funding and attributes the workshops given during YES for providing the inspiration and knowledge needed to start commercialising this idea **\[D\]**. When interviewed in 2019, the YES participant stated: ""The pitch mentoring was so helpful. We learned to dump the science and communicate the benefits of the product because people care about what it does, not what it is"" **\[D\]**. 

 In 2018, Syngenta proposed the theme of ‘protect our planet’ and all sponsors encouraged ideas to address environmental sustainability. The final introduced the innovation of inviting 7 entrepreneurial past participants to augment the judging panel and network with the winning teams **\[4,5\]**. After the final, the Head of Technology Identification and Evaluation for Crop Protection at Syngenta, said: “Collaboration between industry and universities is key to achieving a strong knowledge\-driven economy. For the past eight years we have hosted a YES workshop to tackle specific challenges in order to showcase innovate ideas and to stimulate blue\-sky thinking amongst potential future entrepreneurs to enable them to foresee potential opportunities. Once again there were some great ideas pitched so the future remains bright\!” **\[G\]**. 

 In 2019, the overarching theme was ‘science and engineering empowering sustainability’ **\[6\]**. The final was expanded to include a showcase of how past participants careers had developed because of taking part in YES **\[7\]**. For example, the founder of Seedball explained how she had, in 2013, created the social enterprise to enhance biodiversity. She shared how their product is now stocked by over 150 retailers, both in the UK and across mainland Europe, and how all their profits support global nature reserves. She concluded that “Environment YES gave us the confidence and knowledge to really go for it – we couldn’t recommend the training highly enough” **\[H\]**. The value of YES to the industry partners was summarised by one of the scheme’s partners, Potter Clarkson, “Every year, our employees are asked about IP as a career from a number of YES participants and it is heartening to see those people again a few years later when they join the profession \(even with competitor firms\). When we review CVs, being a YES alumni really does make the candidate stand out and is highly valued by industry” **\[F\]**. 

 Finally, since taking part in YES, one participant has started up four companies in Green Technology and Agriculture before launching a social enterprise in Malaysia to inspire schoolchildren within science and engineering with over 40,000 children taking part in 2019 **\[I\]**. He argued that: “My most important takeaway from YES was confidence. I believe this is something that people need to develop more than anything else. Other things you can learn but confidence needs to be built” **\[I\]**.

Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A core goal of UK foreign policy is to stabilise and support fragile and conflict\-affected countries. The cross\-Whitehall unit tasked with this responsibility is the Stabilisation Unit. Dr Cheng’s research into war\-to\-peace transitions highlighted the critical role that is played by ex\-combatant networks and elite bargains \- political deals between elite groups \(those with significant power to make decisions and implement policies that affects wider populations\). This work has been highly influential and has been both championed at ministerial levels and embedded into Stabilisation Unit practice and policy. Dr Cheng’s research has: \(i\) helped to change UK conflict stabilisation policy from ‘liberal peacebuilding’ \(an aspirational approach rooted in democratisation and free markets\) to ‘elite bargains’ \(a pragmatic approach that recognises the distribution of power on the ground\); \(ii\) influenced country\-specific stabilisation policy, analysis and operations; and \(iii\) consolidated the UK government’s position as a global thought leader on conflict and stabilisation.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Recent civil wars across the Middle East, North Africa, and sub\-Saharan Africa have devastated the lives of many people, with millions displaced and over 600,000 having died on the battlefield since 2010. According to the World Bank, every civil war in Africa that has begun since 2003 has been the resumption of a previous civil war. The question of why some ceasefires and peace agreements hold, while others do not, has been an enduring puzzle in the study of war termination. To that end, Dr Cheng’s award\-winning research \[1\] conducted at King’s College London asks: How do we create stable war\-to\-peace transitions, and prevent soldiers and rebels from returning to war? 

 **Extralegal Groups** 

 Existing research on post\-conflict transitions has focused on the challenges of UN peacekeeping, democratisation, rule of law, and state capacity. In contrast, King’s research has focused on the critical role of ex\-combatant networks in re\-igniting violence or stabilising post\-war environments. Adopting a political economy approach, Dr Cheng found that ex\-combatants were fulfilling local governance functions \(e.g., dispute resolution, contract enforcement\) to sustain their business interests, creating ‘extralegal groups’ in the process. These groups were deliberately co\-opting local and national authorities to maintain control over natural resource areas. In the process, ex\-combatants themselves became ‘local elites’. The result was the capture of existing elites: whereby a small cabal controlled the community and its economic resources \[1\]. 

 In this new post\-conflict equilibrium, political violence was minimised, but at the expense of long\-term reform of the country’s political and economic systems \[2\]. In Liberia, external actors like the UN, the US, and the EU would routinely make these kinds of trade\-offs, tacitly allowing ex\-combatants and their allies to control natural resource enclaves or valuable government ministries in exchange for an end to war. Dr Cheng’s research found that the power and influence that extralegal groups had on the ground meant that wholesale political and economic transformation would be impossible without destabilising the country and provoking a return to war \[2\]. Her conclusions, which showed how liberal peacebuilding was being implemented on\-the\-ground, posed a fundamental challenge to the transformative liberal peacebuilding agenda that the US, UK, EU, UN, and World Bank had long been championing. 

 **Elite Bargains and Political Deals** 

 Because of her extensive knowledge and understanding in the area, Dr Cheng was, in 2016, invited to co\-lead a project on ‘Elite Bargains and Political Deals’ for the UK government with Prof. Jonathan Goodhand and Dr Patrick Meehan at SOAS. The aim was to determine the conditions under which a political deal between elites would hold \- an ‘elite bargain’. As evidenced by the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war, underlying this aim was a recognition by the UK government that the existing ‘liberal peacebuilding’ approach of transforming all of a society’s institutions at once in the aftermath of civil war had not worked. 

 Elite Bargains and Political Deals was commissioned by the Stabilisation Unit \(SU\), a cross\-government unit drawing on expertise from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\), the Department for International Development \(DFID\), and the Ministry of Defence \(MOD\). The SU was tasked with building post\-war stability and preventing armed conflict in fragile states and coordinating the UK’s policy and program response to countries emerging out of armed conflict or violent extremism. The two\-year research project included a team of 21 case study authors and five members of SU staff, culminating in the Elite Bargains Synthesis Paper \[3\] which analysed and brought ideas together, and offered several recommendations to policy\-making, including: 

-  **The need to accept that trade\-offs are inevitable in war\-to\-peace transitions and should be directly addressed by donors and policy\-makers \[1,2,3\].** The most common trade\-off involves prioritising short\-term gains in political and economic stability over the long\-term, structural reforms to social, political, and economic systems. By ‘selling the peace’ in the short run, external actors end up legitimising a system of entrenched corruption \[2,3\]. 

-  **The idea that policy\-makers and scholars place greater emphasis on informal actors and institutions, rather than focus solely on formal actors and processes \[1,2,3\].** While an understanding of informal power relations is an essential starting point for effective policy and practice, this is frequently lacking amongst external interveners. External actors who drive policy \(FCO, DFID, MOD\) tend to concentrate their efforts on brokering national peace agreements and strengthening the formal institutions of government – constitutional reform, the rule of law, security sector reform, and electoral democracy. However, in many contexts, power and violence are managed through informal, rather than formal, actors and institutions. 

-  **The Elite Bargains Framework.** The core principle of the framework is that political stability is only possible if the distribution of political and economic power agreed upon by warring parties is aligned with the actual configuration of power and influence on the ground \[1,2,3\]. Where the distribution of benefits \(be it in a formal peace agreement or an informal elite bargain\) does not reflect the underlying power configuration, the political transition is unstable and there will be a high risk of a return to war \[2,3\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Elite Bargains research and dissemination work was lauded by the SU’s Conflict and Stabilisation Advisor as “a shining example of academic/government engagement and interaction” \[A\]. While the Elite Bargains Synthesis Paper \[3\] was officially launched in June 2018, paper drafts had been circulating within government since Autumn 2017 and had already begun to permeate the thinking of conflict advisors in the SU, the FCO, and DFID. At the launch of the Elite Bargains Synthesis Paper \[3\] on 14 June, 2018, UK Minister of State Alistair Burt used the research’s conclusions to announce a marked change in British foreign policy in war\-to\-peace transitions \[B\]. Previously, a transformative approach to democratisation and free markets \(liberal peacebuilding\) was emphasised, but Minister Burt stated: “We have to get better at recognising that all good things do not come together at the same time. If we force state building and institutional reform before political agreement has been forged, then there is a high risk we will be setting ourselves up for failure… I want to make the case that the international community should apply the lessons of our previous successes more consistently” \[B\]. 

 Building on Dr Cheng’s research on extralegal groups \[1\] and informal actors \[2\] in war\-to\-peace transitions, the Elite Bargains research \[3\] and the synthesis paper subsequently became a foundational source for the UK government’s Dec 2018 ‘The UK Government's approach to Stabilisation: A guide for policy makers and practitioners’ \[C; hereafter the Stabilisation Guide\]. According to its lead author, the Elite Bargains project *“heavily influenced”* \[D\] the Stabilisation Guide, which is described as the ‘one\-stop shop’ for those understanding how the UK ‘does’ stabilisation. They refer to the research \[3\] as one of the foundational projects that highlight the ‘ *policy dilemmas and trade\-offs in stabilisation*’ and stress “ *that political processes should be locally\-led and reflect the reality of local arrangements of power and the elite bargains which underpinned them”* \[C, p9\]. Consequently, King’s research has directly impacted an important group of senior policy\-makers and politicians who decide how the UK government should respond to civil wars fought abroad. Championed by Minister Alistair Burt as “UK thought leadership in this area” \[E\], the research has influenced government policy, from national through to international levels. 

 As a result of the widespread engagement with the project and its application in the Stabilisation Guide, Dr Cheng’s research has: 

#  i. Changed UK conflict stabilisation policy from ‘Liberal Peacebuilding’ to ‘Elite Bargains’ 

 Prior to Minister Burt’s speech \[B\], the UK’s stabilisation policy \(short\-term, post\-war\) advocated a transformative liberal peacebuilding approach \(democratisation, free markets, good governance, human rights, counter\-narcotics\). This did not acknowledge that full and proper implementation of any of these goals could cause political instability during war\-to\-peace transition. In endorsing the Elite Bargains framework, Burt acknowledged that a fully liberal approach without directly addressing the trade\-offs was poor policy practice \[B\]. Dr Cheng’s research \[1\] states this directly, and in doing so, created space for civil servants in the SU, the FCO, DFID, and MOD, to have a more honest debate about government trade\-offs and priorities. As such, King’s research has changed official UK policy so that the default approach is not to sculpt local politics \- especially in authoritarian settings \- into a recognisably liberal form. NZZ, a Swiss newspaper of note, heralded the shift by remarking that realism has made “a comeback in British foreign policy” \[F\]. A government press release for the launch of the Elite Bargains Synthesis Paper \[3\] stresses the vital role of political deal\-making in reducing violent conflict and asserts that the government needs to “keep reviewing our approach in light of experience, and this is what this report seeks to do” \[G\]. 

 Minister Burt highlighted the direct link between the research and shifting policy: it is “important that we’re given academic research that looks very intently at some of the things the politicians do because we don’t get it all right and if we don’t learn lessons, we’re in difficulties” \[B\]. In a letter to parliamentary colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Defence and International Development Committees, he highlighted the publication of the Stabilisation Guide and specifically names the Elite Bargains research. He commended the “strong evidence base” that underpins a new approach outlined that “brings new coherence to our efforts to prevent conflict occurring and reoccurring” \[E\]. 

 In adopting the Elite Bargains Framework, the SU’s conflict analysis practices have changed \(along with the former FCO, MOD, and former DFID\) to now explicitly acknowledge who has “power and influence on the ground” \[G\], accepting that actively displacing these individuals or communities \(e.g., warlords, ex\-combatants, extra\-legal groups\) and pushing for transformative change \- even for good governance reasons \- could lead to a return to war. Official guidance on conflict and stabilisation activity now explicitly warns conflict advisors of the consequences and trade\-offs of pushing for transformative political and economic change \[A,C\]. This push to acknowledge these trade\-offs has been prominent in Dr Cheng’s previous work on post conflict contexts \[1\]. 

#  ii. Directly influenced country\-specific stabilisation policy, analysis and operations 

 The Elite Bargains framework and supporting research was advocated by the Minister of State for the SU directly to conflict advisors and managers in the SU and to analysts working on armed conflict in the FCO, DFID and MOD \[A,C,E\]. It was disseminated to UK government country\-based analysts and is now being operationalised and applied in countries such as Libya, Afghanistan and Mali. In this way, it is indirectly impacting political and economic elites and populations affected by UK stabilisation and humanitarian aid policies. 

 The Elite Bargains research has played a significant role in shaping the way in which the UK government and other stakeholders think about stabilisation interventions and conflict transitions \[A\]. The great impact of the research is evidenced, according to the SUs Conflict and Stabilisation Advisor, by “the entry into the policy lexicon of terms such as elite bargains and political settlements \(and\) the recognition of key policy dilemmas and tensions in our approach in places as varied as Somalia and the Ukraine” \[A\]. A key indicator that the research has made it into the ‘bloodstream’ of stabilisation policy is that the central research narrative was present in submissions made by officials to the \(now postponed\) Integrated Review and planning for a new HMG Conflict department/policy \[A\]. Another example provided by Iain King, former Defense Counsellor in the UK Embassy in Washington, demonstrates how the research was used within Whitehall to provide evidence\-based rationale in responding to President Trump’s decision to favour Turkey over Kurdish militia groups as part of the change in his counter\-Daesh policy \[I\]. 

 The new Stabilisation Guide \[C\] asks explicit questions about the power of informal actors \(i.e., powerful non\-state actors such as influential business leaders, militia, chiefs, criminal bosses\) and whether the elite bargain that is struck includes them within it. As noted by Ed Hadley from the SU, “this links to Dr Cheng’s previous work on the importance of informal actors and how the power of these actors is often unaccounted for in post\-conflict transitions” \[E\]. By allowing government officials to acknowledge that all good things do not go together, the impact of this research \[1,2,3\] has been to promote more realistic dialogue across Whitehall departments and to reduce clashes of UK government policy in conflict\-affected countries. The dissemination of the research and Stabilisation Guide has increased conflict specialists’ awareness of informal \(non\-state\) actors. By providing conflict specialists and analysts with tools to make more accurate security assessments, Minister Burt described the Elite Bargains Framework to parliamentary colleagues as “a ‘handrail’ for officials, experts and international partners, wanting to deliver policy and programming in conflict context more effectively” \[E\]. 

 The UK’s Deputy National Security Advisor asked that the Elite Bargains Framework be applied to numerous contexts, including Libya and Syria \[A\]. The research has been drawn on heavily in Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability assessments for Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Somalia amongst others \[A\]. In Mali, a visit by SU staff in 2018 was undertaken entirely on the basis of the research, and was used to brief an audience of international community members, and to inform and underpin planned analysis and programmes which sought to reduce conflict levels in the centre of Mali. The Stabilisation Guide has been harnessed to inform and challenge programme design being undertaken in the volatile central Sikasso region of the country and the resulting projects have been implemented and are currently being assessed \[A\]. In 2020 the Elite Bargains framework was also used by the international development consultancy firm Chemonics to run training sessions for local Malian analysts and civil society actors working on peace\-building and conflict mediation projects. Adapting the EBPD approach, these localised analysts and peacebuilders are now drawing on global analysis tools to assess their local political economy, with a focus on elite actors. Chemonics have developed an ‘impressive’ training package and toolkit to guide implementing partners in applying the Elite Bargains approach that the SU are considering using in other conflict fragile contexts \[A\]. 

 Building on this research, Dr Cheng was invited to advise the Deputy National Security Advisor on future conflict trends and priorities for spending the £1.26 billion Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund \[A\]. In addition, a session on Elite Bargains has been incorporated into the UK Government’s Conflict and Security training course \(which runs 4\-6 times each year\) for British and international policy and program staff who work on conflict issues **.** Key research findings from Dr Cheng’s book \[1\] and the Elite Bargains Framework were taught in this three\-day UK training course for in\-country conflict specialists and staff from MOD, FCO, the former DFID, and the SU \[A\]. 

#  iii. Consolidated the UK government’s position as a global thought leader on conflict and stabilisation 

 In addition to the public launch of the Synthesis Paper \[3\] at Chatham House, it was also jointly launched by the SU and the FCO to an audience of senior government staff of 80\+ conflict policy makers in a roundtable discussion. The Synthesis Paper has subsequently been presented across UK government agencies, including at overseas missions such as: the UK Embassies in Mali and Afghanistan; foreign policy makers at the Folke Bernadotte Academy, Stockholm; the International Conference for Stabilisation Leaders, Paris; and the Christiansborg Conference on Preventive Diplomacy. Most recently it has been used by the UK Defense Counsellor in Washington to frame conversations with senior US policy\-makers in the Biden administration \[H\]. 

 An annual qualitative assessment of the Stabilisation Unit by the Overseas Development Institute highlighted how the Elite Bargains research provided “ *thought leadership*” on current stabilisation activity \[I\]. By challenging the notion that a liberal transformation is achievable in the short term, the Elite Bargains project has helped the SU fulfill its role to “ *provide a challenge function for conflict and stabilisation activity*” \[I\]. Generating considerable attention and debate from the media \[J1\], including in the widely respected World Politics Review \[J2\], and the charity sector \[J3\], the research has resulted in numerous government\-to\-government exchanges and knowledge sharing, which SU’s Conflict and Stabilisation Advisor describes as “ *consolidating the UK’s position as a thought leader on conflict and stabilisation*"" \[A\]. Former UK Defense Counsellor Iain King has highlighted how the research has enabled him to demonstrate to key US think\-tank officials \- some of whom will go on to define Biden’s foreign policy \- how to craft an approach to conflict engagement in developing countries that is both practical and evidence\-based \[H\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by the Electoral Psychology Observatory has been used to improve election processes around the world and enhance the electoral experience for citizens, notably disabled and first\-time voters. The research has led to changes in ballot paper design and polling station organisation in the Palestinian Territories, underpinned \[text removed for publication\] decision to shelve electoral reforms that would have increased inequality in access to the vote for minority groups, contributed expert evidence to a landmark Irish Supreme Court case on the influence of government communications on voters' perceptions, improved Opinium's political polling methodology to deliver more accurate election forecasts, helped to shape best practice among election management bodies and establish new initiatives recognising excellence in electoral affairs, and influenced the writing and production of a new Apple Television series. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2011, the Electoral Psychology Observatory \(EPO, previously ECREP\) has conducted research on electoral psychology and electoral ergonomics. It is led by Professor Michael Bruter and Dr Sarah Harrison. The work of the EPO represents a shift in approach to electoral research, making it truly “voter\-centric”. Fundamentally, this involves refocusing electoral research on the voter’s point of view; who people vote for is less important than understanding how elections affect citizens’ happiness or emotions, or under what circumstances they will bring them a sense of closure and resolution. This shift has tremendous implications for how we approach elections as an object and voters as actors, the questions we ask, the methods we use \(over 90% of political behaviour is, in fact, subconscious\), and our understanding of the interface between voters’ psychology and electoral organisation \(what we label “electoral ergonomics”\). 

 The impacts described here are underpinned by research insights in six key areas: 1\) on voters’ psychology and the nature and implications of their electoral experiences; 2\) on the interface between voters’ psychology and election design \(electoral ergonomics\); 3\) on the nature and importance of the first electoral experience \(first\-time voters\); 4\) on the electoral experience of vulnerable categories \(disabled voters, illiterate voters, minorities, etc\); 5\) on the consequences of electoral psychology and experience of fractures with potential to split societies \(electoral hostility\); and 6\) on how new variables and methods can be adapted to everyday stakeholders’ practice, from electoral observation and polling to culture \(conceptual and methodological toolbox\). 

 EPO research combines innovative methodologies \(visual electoral experiments, electoral family focus groups, panel election diaries\) with classic approaches \(e.g. panel study surveys of up to five years, physiological experiments, field experiments, interviews, etc.\). Key findings include: 

 **On voter psychology** 

-  *The atmosphere of elections changes in the last week:* 20\-30% of voters change their minds within a week of a typical major election, half of them on Election Day **\[1\]**. 

-  *First times matter:* participating in one of the first two elections of a citizen’s life will likely make them chronic participants whilst abstaining from both will likely lead to chronic abstention **\[4\]**. 

-  *Elections are emotional:* 25% of Americans have cried because of an election and 63% say that election night makes them feel emotional; 34% of British voters had tears in their eyes in relation to the EU Membership referendum, including 49% of 18\-25\-year\-olds **\[1\]**. 

-  *Elections are positive experiences:* 63% of voters say that they feel happy in the polling booth, 60% feel excited, 74% proud, and 79% say that it is an important moment for them. Moreover, excitement is a bigger driver of turnout than duty to vote, especially amongst young people **\[1\]**. 

 **On electoral ergonomics** 

-  *People vote differently when they vote remotely:* 18\-25\-year\-old British postal\-voters were twice as likely to vote for the extreme right than those who went to a polling station **\[3\]**. 

-  *In\-station voting makes voters happier and more sociotropic:* in\-station voters tend to feel more efficacious, more positive about democracy, and relate to other citizens more than remote voters. Young voters are notably less positive when voting from home \(by post/email\) **\[2\]**. 

-  *Not all remote voting options were created equal:* in US elections, “advance” voting leads to more sociotropic voting than “absentee” voting, and voters describe their electoral experience as happier and more exciting, and are more likely to vote at the next election **\[1\]**. 

-  *Ballot design affects thinking time:* when voting electronically, voters think for an average of 20 seconds before casting their vote, compared to 30 seconds with a UK paper ballot, and one minute with French paper ballots. Machine voting leads to more negative emotions **\[1\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impacts described here are the result of the EPO's sustained engagement with diverse groups of electoral stakeholders throughout the REF assessment period. This includes electoral commissions, governments, polling agencies, electoral observers, and the High Court. The research has been used to make concrete changes to the running of elections \(e.g. to polling station organisation and ballot paper design\), developed the skills and capacities of those working on elections, informed changes to polling methodologies, and shaped and encouraged the recognition of best practice among electoral practitioners. These changes have contributed to an improved experience of elections, notably among disabled, first\-time, and minority voters, and to greater accuracy in election polling. Details of these impacts are described below. 

 **Optimising electoral procedures for voters in the Palestinian Territories** 

 In May 2015, Bruter and Harrison led a two\-day training session for senior staff of the Central Electoral Commission \(CEC\) of the Palestinian Territories **\[A\]**. This session was funded by the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) to strengthen democracy in the Palestinian Territories and built upon earlier engagement with the CEC that also included a smaller capacity\-building event in London in 2015. This particular session addressed a variety of electoral psychology issues identified as important to the Palestinian context \- including social divisions, gender inequalities, and civic education \- and considered how these interact with, and might precipitate a change in approach to, electoral management **\[1\] \[3\] \[4\]**. The CEO of the CEC credits this session \- allied to other insights from EPO research on electoral ergonomics \- with having prompted a shift in the CEC's role "" *from mere implementer of elections processes to more open and proactive roles promoting \[the\] democratic process in full partnership with the community it serves*"", particularly evident in a changed "" *approach to address first\-time voters and \[introduction of\] a new design of the polling stations to respond to the needs of people with disabilities*"" **\[A\]**. 

 Subsequently, electoral reforms enacted in 2016 have introduced new laws on candidate eligibility, allowing greater gender representation and lowering the minimum age requirement, both initiatives intended to promote greater feelings of inclusion and identification among women and younger voters. Technical changes have led to the redesign of ballot papers and polling stations to better accommodate the needs of disabled voters. And the establishment of a new Electoral Awareness Fund and outreach initiatives led by civil society organisations form part of a drive to increase participation in the forthcoming 2021 municipal elections. 

 Addressing these various initiatives, the CEC CEO has said: "" *We at the CEC firmly believe that using insights from the Bruter and Harrison research \[has\] contributed to better understanding \[of\] the way we serve voters in elections regardless of age, gender or disabilities, and will lead to a better experience and participation of the Palestinian citizens in the coming years*"". These benefits extend to 2.2 million voters in the municipal elections **\[A\]**. 

-  **Ensuring equitable elections and effective access to the vote for all \[text removed for publication\] citizens** 

 At the request of \[text removed for publication\], Bruter and Harrison provided expert advice to \[text removed for publication\] on proposed reforms of the country’s electoral system. Their submitted report **\[B\]** convinced the government to limit its planned reforms on the basis that they would increase inequality in access to the vote for some minorities and be psychologically unacceptable to parts of the population, resulting in a compromise reform in December 2014. 

 The government’s proposal put forward two alternative plans based on a mixture of plurality and best\-loser system, with a top up proportional allocation based on an “unreturned votes elect” system. Bruter and Harrison designed six institutional tests and six psychological tests that should be met by any viable electoral system reform and simulated the impact of the two electoral system reforms under consideration. Following the collection of electoral psychology data, Bruter and Harrison’s analysis, firmly grounded in the underpinning research **\[1\] \[2\]**, showed that the proposed reforms could increase unfairness, negatively affect the representation of some of the country’s minorities, entrench gender inequality, and be viewed negatively by \- and lack the acceptance of \- \[text removed for publication\] **\[B\]**. The original reform plan was consequently shelved by the Prime Minister and replaced by cross\-party discussions. 

-  **Providing expert witness advice in an Irish constitutional referendum case** 

 Bruter served as Expert Witness in cases tried by the Irish High Court and the Irish Supreme Court on the impact of the Irish Government’s framing of the Referendum on Children’s Rights on voters’ behaviour. \(This referendum was held to approve an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland which inserted clauses relating to children's rights and the right and duty of the state to take child protection measures.\) The government’s campaign was accused of being biased in favour of a “Yes” vote \(i.e. approval of the amendment\) and the Courts were asked to judge whether the campaign was, in fact, neutral and thereby constitutional \(first case\), and also whether it could have materially affected the outcome \(second case\). The government lost the first case in a landmark judgment but won the second \(i.e. the referendum result was not overturned\) in a final Supreme Court judgment of 24 April 2015. Bruter’s evidence **\[2\] \[3\]** figured prominently in proceedings, as noted in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice John MacMenamin: “ *the appellant sought to base a substantial part of her case on Dr Bruter’s conclusions, reached following his analysis of the raw data*” **\[C**, para. 48 **\]**. Bruter’s expert evidence is referenced extensively throughout the judgment **\[C**, paras. 40\-61 **\]**. 

 **Improving political polling methodologies to more accurately forecast election results** 

 The EPO has worked regularly and extensively with Opinium, the political polling agency, throughout the current REF assessment period. They have worked together on numerous international electoral survey studies, with the EPO providing research input on the design of sample frames, the scripts for questionnaires, and on the deployment of surveys to nationally representative samples of citizens of various countries, at various points in the election cycle **\[D\]**. Meetings with the Opinium electoral forecasting team were held to discuss weighting variations based on EPO findings on electoral psychology, including developing new measures identifying which voters are most likely to change their minds in the run up to an election, and controlling for registration before applying weightings to avoid over\-estimating youth abstention **\[1\] \[3\]**. 

 The Chief Executive of Opinium considers the learnings from this collaboration to have been key to the Opinium political polling team having been the most accurate research agency at the 2019 General Election and one of just two agencies to have accurately predicted the outcome of the EU referendum in 2016: "" *Without a doubt, credit must be given to the inspiration and learnings we have gained from the EPO which has undoubtedly influenced how we as an agency look to understand the voting psychology of the British voters. For example, insights from EPO’s research have been critical in taking into account psychological variables in panel and sample design. Conversely, their work on question phrasing has helped us optimise variables that we use in political polling and barometer studies. Most importantly the importance of personality and emotion, both of which now have a place in our own methodology*"" **\[D\]**. Opinium carry out frequent election surveys in the UK and the US and provide regular political polling for national and international media, notably *The* *Observer*. 

 **Influencing best practice in electoral management** 

 EPO research has also been used by electoral stakeholders who work internationally to improve the practices and processes of elections **\[1\] \[3\]**. For example, the Delian Project is a non\-governmental organisation dedicated to helping jurisdictions implement positive change in the democratic voting process. Managing Director, Dr Allan Best describes how engagement with the EPO has prompted the Delian Project to place greater emphasis on electoral psychology in the course of its work: “ *one of the biggest ways that \[Bruter\] and \[Harrison\]’s research has really opened the eyes of senior individuals in election management bodies is the fact that in EMBs we tend to look more at the logistics of an election as opposed to the science and emotion of an election. This is critical. The fact that they have been able to bring analytical and critical\-based research, atmospherics that actually let us understand what is the target audience, what are they looking to glean from an election, how do we increase voter turnout, and more importantly how do we make a successful election that actually is relevant to the voter in a way that is human, that is emotive, that is actually something that caters to them as opposed to something that is an exercise in logistics*” **\[E\]**. 

 **Influence on electoral observation practices in the Falkland Islands** 

 This work has also had an effect on electoral observation missions. It was put into practice when the Delian Project served as an election observer for the independence referendum in the Falkland Islands. Using questions developed by the EPO **\[1\] \[2\]**, the Delian Project was able to gain insights into the unique emotion of an independence referendum, even among a very small population of 1,600. Best has since said that the answers to those questions on voters’ electoral experience were “ *very useful to us to understand that we have to be very cognisant of emotions*” **\[E\]**. 

 **Establishment of new awards fostering and rewarding best practice** 

 Bruter and Harrison have shared best practice in election processes **\[1\] \[2\]** with election management bodies \(EMBs\) through the International Centre for Parliamentary Studies \(ICPS\), which promotes effective policymaking and good governance through capacity\-building and specialises in electoral affairs **\[E\]**. Arvind Venkataramana, former CEO of the ICPS, has attested to the usefulness of the underpinning research in helping EMBs to improve voter satisfaction specifically. According to Venkataramana, “ *where \[Bruter and Harrison\] make a significant impact is to improve the overall voter experience, which, in turn, results in greater voter turnout, which is a success for election management bodies*.” EMBs have found the research “ *very useful to implement strategies that they’ve been wanting to implement for a while, especially to attract first\-time voters, to improve access for disabled voters, adapt new technologies in their regions, and also they’ve used their insights to design ballot papers more innovatively*” **\[E\]**. 

 After Bruter presented findings on electoral psychology and electoral ergonomics at their annual international conferences, the ICPS created four new categories in its Electoral Stakeholder Awards, to better recognise outstanding work by EMBs. The new award categories were in Electoral Ergonomics, Citizens Engagement, First\-Time Voters, and Accessibility. These have been bestowed every year since December 2013, encouraging greater innovation among EMBs in trying to improve the overall voter experience. Venkataramana has identified the Electoral Ergonomics category, in particular, as being among those to receive the most \- and most creative \- nominations **\[E\]**. Bruter served on the awards committee until 2019. 

 **Influence on the production of a new television series** 

 Findings from the EPO research **\[2\] \[4\]** have also informed the writing of a new Apple Television spy series. *Life Undercover*, starring Brie Larson, dramatises a fictional French election, set against the background of an extremist threat and electoral disruption. A production team research assistant discovered the Bruter and Harrison research and invited them to a meeting in Los Angeles. Briefing the team of nine writers and producers, Bruter and Harrison offered expert input on the dramatic scenario, including insights on voter psychology. Megan Martin, the lead writer, says: ""\[ *Bruter\] and \[Harrison\]'s insights into the transmission of extremist ideology, and the psychology of voters were invaluable...As the writers continued to shape story lines, \[Bruter\] and \[Harrison\]'s time with us grounded the narrative in ways that continued to surprise and impress me*"" **\[F\]**. Production has been halted due to the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

 **Helping to give first\-time voters and cognitively disabled voters a voice in the UK, South Africa, and Australia** 

 EPO research has also been used in the course of initiatives intended to give first\-time voters and those with learning and cognitive disabilities a greater voice in electoral processes in the UK, South Africa, and Australia **\[1\] \[3\]**. Since 2019, Bruter and Harrison have worked on the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Votes at 16 to help it build a case for the extension of the voting franchise to 16 and 17\-year\-olds, with a first report published in 2019. Similarly, since 2016, Bruter and Harrison have been working with the South African Independent Electoral Commission \(IEC\) to test pilot measures intended to make the electoral experience of first\-time voters feel rewarding and more likely to motivate sustained electoral engagement **\[G\]**. The work involved collaboration with South African youth organisations and one of the IEC Commissioners. The IEC subsequently began running pilot information campaigns in a selection of electoral wards in August 2016. 

 In parallel, EPO organised two policy labs \(in 2018 and 2019\) in collaboration with the Australian Electoral Commission \(AEC\) and the state\-level commissions of South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Here, research findings focusing on the experience of voters with mental health issues were shared with commissioners and a team of 20\+ divisional heads at the AEC. EPO and AEC organised a joint observation of the 2019 Federal Election, focused on the experience of disabled and special\-needs voters, in particular. Bruter and Harrison worked with staff in polling stations dedicated to accommodating disabled voters **\[H\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Dyer’s research on the systemic under\-representation of mobile pastoralists in education systems has directly influenced international and national stakeholders, and national sectoral policies. At global level, her evidence and policy recommendations have shaped strategic advice and programming issued by UNESCO, UNICEF, the British Council, Save the Children, and UN Global Education Monitoring Reports \(2015, 2018\). In Ethiopia, Dyer’s research called for improved government delivery capacity for the national *2017 Pastoralist Education Strategy,* which she subsequently co\-wrote. In Mongolia, Dyer’s research\-led recommendations for UNESCO’s *2019 Education Policy Review* on sustainable pastoralist livelihoods, rural futures and closer sectoral engagement with lifelong learning, were incorporated directly into Mongolia’s national *2020\-2030 Education Master Plan*.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Addressing the dynamics of education exclusion in the global drylands, which cover 41% of the world’s land surface and where pastoralism is the dominant livelihood, is of crucial importance to achieving UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 \(quality education and lifelong learning\) and other SDGs. Drylands have suffered decades of policy inattention in resourcing social services and infrastructural development. They need specialist responses to the complex challenges of providing education without undermining mobile pastoralist livelihoods, and have benefited least from the expansion of formal schooling using delivery models suited to sedentary populations.  Pastoralists’ widespread marginalisation in formal education is a global problem that reflects misunderstandings of their livelihood, a weak evidence base to inform policy choices, and limited technical capacities among education system actors. 

 Dyer’s career\-long research applies knowledge of pastoralist livelihoods and dryland variability to research on how pastoralists’ education exclusion is produced and could be mitigated. Her field and desk\-based empirical research, spanning India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Ethiopia and Mongolia, provides case studies and evidence relevant for all drylands. Dyer has evidenced how the global *Education For All* movement, led by UNESCO, marginalised mobile pastoralists **\[5,4\]**, because most delivery models create an oppositional relationship between education provision and the situated learning and mobility intrinsic to a sustainable pastoralist livelihood **\[5,3,4\]**. Her international comparative perspective focuses on how education services could avoid antagonistic terms of inclusion, reinforce pastoralists’ traditional livelihood and cultural values, and thus better respond to pastoralist livelihood imperatives **\[3,4\]** and the SDG4 lifelong learning pledge. 

 In Ethiopia in 2016, the inter\-ministerial Quality Education Strategic Support Programme \(QESSP\) commissioned Dyer to research promoting pastoralists’ inclusion as part of the Ministry of Education’s policy commitment to universal education. Dyer designed and led a situation analysis of education provision in four pastoralist regions. Her analysis showed that the already limited policy options of the *2008 Pastoralist Education Strategy* were further constrained by weak governance and delivery that gave rise to marginalising effects **\[2\]**. There was strong reliance on Alternative Basic Education Centres, which the research found deficient in staffing, material provisions, relevance, and capacity to ensure learner progression, while mobile provision remained absent and inclusion in mainstream schooling was neglected. 

 In Mongolia in 2019, Dyer was the lead international researcher for UNESCO’s 2019 Education Policy Review \(EPR\) process. The EPR initially drew on the Institute for Education Research’s draft  [Country Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GidBkoi1vwMOkN9Win3-pum2PQYs_8C2?usp=sharing) **,** which Dyer provided technical inputs to ensure that pastoralists’ educational status was directly evidenced. Dyer’s research inputs for the EPR’s *Preliminary Report* included a literature review and three field visits. The first \(March 2019\) included 30 stakeholder interviews and eight classroom observations in Xinti and Dornod Districts, and Ulaanbaatar. Dyer authored key sections of the *Preliminary Report*, using research inputs to shape policy recommendations to improve access, educator competences, and education quality at all levels of the system. She identified an urgent need to improve the status of provision for pastoralists, specifically by improving residential schools and early childhood provision, and adopting e\-learning, and better integrating education as a development strategy to ensure a sustainable future for pastoralists in the rapidly changing rural landscape. She interviewed high\-level stakeholders in September 2019 to deepen the *Preliminary Report’s* analysis; led the writing of UNESCO’s final  [Education Policy Review](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373687) *;* co\-led a participatory validation process \(Ulaanbaatar, December 2019\); and presented key recommendations on pastoralists at the official *EPR* launch \(September 2020\) attended by the Education Minister.  As outlined in Section 4, the policy priorities of the completed 2020 UNESCO *Mongolia EPR* incorporate Dyer’s research on aligning approaches to education delivery with transforming drylands contexts and the need to ensure dignified, sustainable, pastoralist livelihoods **\[b\]**. 

 At the global level, the UN’s Global Education Monitoring \(GEM\) team commissioned Dyer to research approaches to pastoralists’ inclusion for its 2014 report **\[4\]**. In 2016, GIZ – the service provider funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development \(BMZ\) \- and Educate A Child \- a global program of the Qatari Education Above All Foundation \- commissioned Dyer to lead a new desk study, supported by key stakeholder interviews, to identify promising models of school inclusion for mobile children **\[6\]**. In 2017, Dyer held a University of Leeds ESRC/Impact Acceleration Account Knowledge Exchange Fellowship investigating Save the Children \(UK\)’s ‘networked schooling’ model in 371 primary schools in Ethiopia’s Somali region **\[a\]**, which evidenced how networked schooling embedded in pastoralists’ drought management strategies enables continuous inclusion across the migratory cycle, and avoids antagonistic terms of inclusion. Her research evidence shows that providers need to continue to focus on making schooling more accessible and relevant, but also focus more closely on retaining learners and ensuring their progression **\[1\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dyer’s career\-long research has: \(i\) helped set the international agenda by raising global awareness of pastoralist’s education needs, providing an evidence base to inform and shape global policy effort, and; instituting livelihood\-sensitive approaches to pastoralists’ education inclusion within national policy strategies in \(ii\) Ethiopia and \(iii\) Mongolia. 

 **\(i\) Raising awareness and providing an evidence\-base for global education policy and practice for international organisations and NGOs** 

 Dyer’s research has played a crucial role in helping key global and national education actors to understand pastoralists’ educational needs for global advocacy and national policies. Global efforts to raise awareness and inform an educational agenda for change widely use her research, and international organisations regularly commission her technical expertise to generate research evidence and policy advice. For example, several UN Global Education Monitoring Reports \(GEMRs\) have drawn upon her evidence and analyses. Established in 2002, the GEMR is an annual agenda\-setting report with thematic foci, used by state and non\-state decision makers seeking evidence to inform their actions on inclusive and equitable quality education at national, regional and global levels. These Reports play a crucial role in informing educational stakeholders on policy ‘best practice’ and presenting evidence that supports educational policy reforms aiming to achieve SDG4. The 2019 GEMR, which argues that ‘nomad and pastoralist education needs are not addressed’ \( **\[A\]** p. 22 **\)**, for example, makes six citations of Dyer’s Educate A Child \(EAC\)/German International Cooperation Institute \(GIZ\) commissioned, co\-authored study **\[6\]** and presents her evidence on networked schooling **\[1\]** in its reporting on global efforts to adjust education to livelihood\-related mobility **\[A\]**. Dyer’s 2014 Background Paper \(which became **\[4\]**\), commissioned for the 2000\-2015 global overview of Education for All in the 2015 GEMR, is cited as key evidence seven times within the four paragraphs devoted to nomadic pastoralists **\[B\]**. The 2019 GEMR’s use of Dyer’s updated evidence **\[6\]** to argue that nomads’ needs are not addressed, that education should be adjusted to seasonality and mobility, and its relevance to their livelihoods improved, shows how her research has raised issue awareness and sharpened understanding \( **\[A\]** pp. 21\-22\). 

 Dyer’s research has highlighted evidence gaps and this has led to collaborations aiming to close them, including with UNESCO, Save the Children **\[C\]**, the British Council, the UN’s GEMR team, EAC and GIZ **\[D\]**. Dyer engaged with non\-academic stakeholders via events in Doha \(2017\), Berlin \(2016\), Atlanta \(2017\), and the University of Leeds \(2018 and 2019 conferences w/ Save the Children, ca. 60 participants\). The Executive Director at EAC commends Dyer’s innovative suggestion of adding interviews to supplement the desk research it commissioned, which ‘ *increased our reach*’ as a ‘ *wide range of actors wanted the opportunity to discuss issues and contribute*’ and enabled EAC to ‘ *share through our global network the practical and policy challenges faced when providing quality education for children from mobile populations*’ **\[D\]**. The research highlighted for EAC and *‘implementing partners’* the ‘ *need to programme in specific ways to provide education to some of the hardest to reach children*’, with ‘ *clear examples of how policy and programmatic approaches can be implemented to meet the educational needs of children who find themselves “on the move”’* **\[D\]**. 

 A Senior Education Advisor at Save the Children describes Dyer as a *‘thought leader’* who is ‘ *internationally recognised as an authoritative source on pastoralist education research’* **\[C\].** Her research is understood as ‘ *critical for policy and practice as it highlights the urgent need to intervene in a unique, pastoralist centred approach if we are to reach those children who are left behind, and contribute to the realisation of SDGs’*. The charity uses Dyer’s research as a ‘ *great resource and addition to our knowledge bank*’ and ‘ *point of reference when designing new projects*’ to ‘ *inform our education programming and advocacy in various pastoralist contexts we work’* **\[C\]**. In particular, Dyer’s work on ‘networked schooling’ **\[1\]**, which Save innovated and Dyer sharpened,  resulted in ‘ *an impact in Ethiopia by providing a model enabling hard to reach communities to gain education access*’ \[see below\] with ‘ *very good potential for other international applications with mobile populations’,* and will also *‘inform \[…\] our future programming*’ **\[C\]**. 

 In Mongolia \(2019\), the collaborative research methodology Dyer shaped to fit the *‘distinctive education and development context’*, outlined below in \(iii\), has inspired UNESCO to revise its internal guidelines for best practice on how to carry out further Education Policy Reviews **\[E\]**. Her applied research ‘ *contributed to UNESCO’s Major Programme I \(Education\) and the specific expected result “improved national education policies and plans to advance access to equitable and quality* *\[early childhood care and education\], primary and secondary education through a system\-wide lifelong learning approach*”’ **.** Dyer’s expertise contributed to *‘strengthening UNESCO’s esteem as a respected knowledge organization providing policy analysis and advice’*, whilst *s*ome of the *EPR’s* conclusions *‘are relevant far beyond Mongolia to the global debate on education and learning’* **\[E\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Changing education policy in Ethiopia to better include marginalised pastoralists** 

 Ethiopia’s pastoralist population comprises ca. 12\-15 million people and rates of education participation among pastoralist children fall far below national averages **\[F\]**. Dyer was appointed as the international expert to conduct research and co\-author Ethiopia’s *Pastoralist Education Strategy 2017* \(PES 2017\) by the government’s Quality Education Strategic Support Programme \(QESSP\).  A former educational consultant for UNICEF Ethiopia explains that Dyer’s *‘expertise greatly assisted in formulating a policy that was more focused, and progressive in terms of intent and language’* **\[G\].** Her review of international evidence on delivery modalities and empirical analysis of implementation of the *Pastoralist Education Strategy 2008* changed the strategic emphasis of the new 2017 Strategy to focus on a wider range of delivery approaches, and embedded lessons from her long\-standing research by including details of modalities and extensive guidance on stakeholder roles and responsibilities for implementation **\[1,4\]**. Dyer led stakeholder workshops with field teams of UNICEF and Save the Children, and with three government Regional Education Bureaux, which evidenced high dependence for pastoralists’ education inclusion on under\-resourced, poorly managed Alternative Basic Education Centres. This evidence, and its equity implications, was discussed at a national consultation meeting \(Addis Ababa, April 2016\) for 20 key ministerial, inter\-agency and civil\-society stakeholders. The discussion *‘greatly supported development partners to identify best practices and highlight the great needs within this nomadic/semi nomadic setting’* **\[G\]**. For UNICEF, the situation analysis was a ‘ *strong independent piece of empirical research*’ which prompted UNICEF to commission its own external evaluation of Alternative Basic Education to *‘determine the pitfalls’* **\[G\]**. In July 2017, Dyer was an expert respondent for the evaluation, which makes 16 references to the situation analysis findings **\[H\]**. In combination, both bodies of research **‘** *showed a gap in understanding the considerable investment needed to deliver quality pastoralist education*’ **\[G\]**. UNICEF subsequently ‘ *decided to shift its focus to improving the quality of education in these settings and creating a more equitable standard, instead of supporting large scale ABE* \[Alternative Basic Education Centres\] *construction, without adequate follow through*’ **\[G\]**. UNICEF affirms that under Dyer’s guidance and co\-authorship, *PES 2017* departed from ‘ *a litany of different approaches borrowed from other countries that were often not implemented, and/or not adequately supported or monitored’* and ‘ *instead allowed the Government to reflect more internally on the shortcomings in pastoral settings and narrow the focus based on lessons learned from the situational analysis*’ **\[G\]**. The *PES* *2017* and revised ABE guidelines, along with the system strengthening focus that Dyer emphasised, are reported as outputs of the now completed QESSP \( **\[I\],** p. 12\), setting the policy agenda of the government and development actors’ support for the years ahead **\[F\]**. 

 **\(iii\) Re\-focusing education policy in Mongolia to emphasise lifelong learning and education’s role in sustainable pastoralism and rural futures** 

 The official with responsibility for managing the 2019 UNESCO *Education Policy Review* \( *EPR*\), commissioned by the government of Mongolia \(where some 30% of the 3.2 million population is involved in mobile pastoralism\), explains that Dyer’s globally recognised promotion of pastoralists’ education inclusion, underpinned by her *‘deep intellectual enquiry and sustained commitment to the well\-being of these communities’*, led directly to UNESCO commissioning her as international lead for the *EPR* **\[E,J\]** *.* Dyer ‘ *brought research findings from Kenya, Ethiopia and India to bear on the policy debates in Mongolia on ‘productivity’, access to quality and relevant education, and the long\-term national vision for sustainable development*’ **\[E\]**. Her grasp of global evidence and Mongolia\-specific research findings brought ‘ *new perspectives to counterparts and national education stakeholders’* and enabled the UN team to integrate into the *EPR* recommendations to re\-orient education to support pastoralism, rural development, and national Green Economy pledges; and to challenge the narrow focus on industrial employability in the technical and vocational \(TVET\) sector **\[E\]**. At the beginning of the *EPR* process, Dyer advised the Mongolian Institute of Education Research \(MIER\) to include a new, separate section to highlight pastoralists’ education status in the Country Report that MIER authored, which the UN then used as the foundation document for the *EPR*. As a result of Dyer’s input, the UN’s *EPR* **\[J\]**, which focuses on lifelong learning for all, included a specific, separate Policy Domain for pastoralists’ education \(Policy Domain 3, pp. 103\-118\). Furthermore, the UN’s *EPR* team leader found that Dyer’s expertise on pastoralism ‘ *significantly enhanced the credibility and standing of the EPR team, in the eyes of national officials and stakeholders, and international development partners, such as UNICEF, the World Bank, the Global Partnership for Education, and the Asian Development Bank*’ **\[E\]**. The *EPR* provides a range of prioritised policy recommendations, including improved and equitable provision for pastoralists **\[J\]**. Many of Dyer’s recommendations have been included subsequently in Mongolia’s forthcoming *2020\-30 Education Master Plan* **,** which is the policy framework for all education sector activity for the next ten years and directly draws on the *EPR*. As a result, in the UN *EPR* team leader’s view, Dyer’s work ‘ *will undoubtedly impact on the future governance and strategic directions of education in Mongolia as well as the character of development cooperation’* **\[E\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Alexander is a leading authority on medieval and early\-modern buildings in the UK and Europe, whose expertise is called on by those responsible for heritage buildings for conservation purposes and to inform the visitor experience on site, and by the media. She has worked with architects at Crowland Abbey on the conservation of the medieval sculpture, which enhanced visitors' understanding. Her research has led to a virtual reconstruction initiative at Lincoln Cathedral, 'Lincoln Cathedral Connected', a multidisciplinary transformational project for visitors funded by the Lottery Heritage Fund. Internationally, her research on the UNESCO world heritage site, Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, Spain, has enhanced visitors' interaction with the building; and media interviews after the Notre\-Dame fire in Paris led to increased global public engagement with the challenging issues facing conservation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Alexander's research is based on detailed archaeological analysis of standing buildings to understand their development over several centuries \(listed against specific sites below: 1\-5\), to provide evidence for the phases of their construction \(1\-5\), and to enable reconstruction of lost elements \(1,2,5\). The research incorporates a deep understanding of construction \(1,3,4,5\), stonemasonry \(1\-5\) architectural and sculptural history \(1\-5\), and the historical working methods of building designers and constructors \(3\-5\). 

 From detailed study of individual buildings, Alexander has demonstrated expertise in analysing architectural elements and interpreting evidence, especially where their survival has been partial. 

 Alexander has developed new methodologies for the study of historic stone buildings which enable hitherto intractable questions about their construction to be addressed and answered effectively. Through purpose\-built computer analysis, designed by Alexander herself, she is able to examine distribution patterns of the construction marks left on the buildings by stonemasons, enabling her to provide expert answers to questions about levels of specialisation amongst medieval carvers or stone\-cutters, the speed of construction and consistency of building activity, the planning and supply of materials, and the significance of stylistic changes to structure. Since 2007 at the University of Warwick, Alexander has studied and published on a wide range of medieval church buildings, and more recently, has successfully applied the same techniques to early\-modern country houses. 

 Following long\-term engagement with historic architecture she is able to make assessments about the significance of collections of worked stone, and has been commissioned to compile reports to heritage bodies, such as Historic England, on buildings and collections of worked stone in their care. 

 Alexander has been expert advisor on projects including: 

 **1. Crowland \(also historically known as Croyland\) Abbey \(3.1\)** and **2.** **Crowland West Front Sculpture \(3.2\)** 

 In 2014, Alexander undertook a systematic analysis of the medieval church at Crowland Abbey in Lincolnshire and its sculpture, provided the context of its late\-medieval church design and demonstrated its relationship to the veneration of the saint whose cult centred on the abbey. Alexander’s research showed how the medieval masons approached the structural problems of building on a waterlogged site, and she has created the definitive photographic record of the most complete assembly of sculptural figures to survive in situ from the late medieval period in the UK \(3.1; 3.2\). 

 **3. Santiago de Compostela \(2014, 3.3\)** and **4. Hexham Abbey \(2013, 3.4\)** 

 Alexander’s detailed study of these buildings has addressed the question, 'how did they build the cathedrals?'. Her work involved forensic examination of the evidence within the buildings themselves in tandem with the documentary evidence, making a substantial contribution to the understanding of the history of the buildings and informing their care and preservation. The same approach has made it possible to reveal the design and engineering skills of medieval stone\-masons, and to make this accessible to visitors of the buildings they constructed, and has thus enhanced users’ understanding and appreciation of them. 

 **5. Kirby Hall \(3.5\)** 

 Following previously commissioned research between 2005 and 2006 on Apethorpe Hall for English Heritage \(now Historic England\), Alexander was invited to undertake research on a second great house in Northants, Kirby Hall in 2012. Employing specialist methodologies developed for medieval buildings, Alexander guided the forensic analysis of the Jacobethan great house and provided scientific evidence to support an historical reconstruction of the building. Her research demonstrated that the State Apartments were built very soon after the house was completed, which was previously unknown, and explained how the Elizabethan owner had thus changed its purpose in order to attract visits from the royal entourage. Alexander proved that Kirby Hall was shown to have been built by masons working on other major houses in the region and its architectural context is now firmly established.  Alexander’s research has led to greater understanding of its construction which underpins future conservation plans and presentation of the site to the public.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Alexander's research has provided expertise to heritage bodies in the UK and Europe which they have used in the conservation of, and for supporting public engagement with, built cultural heritage. 

###  Informing the Conservation of English Medieval Buildings 

 Most recently, Alexander's research and expertise on Crowland Abbey \(3.1\) led architects Anderson and Glenn to commission a specialist report from her \(3.2\) on the West front sculpture of the Abbey’s facade, which provided the basis for a successful bid to the Lottery Heritage Fund for conservation of the façade, carried out between 2014 and 2015. By expertly establishing the dates, contexts and purpose of the sculpture in the medieval period, and by demonstrating the architectural development of the settings for the figures and their significance as works of art, Alexander’s research, and accompanying photographic record, underpinned the conservation decisions about the whole facade. Her report also guided and supported the architects' decision\-making about the form of the conservation work. As a result of Alexander’s research demonstrating their importance as the most significant set of late\-medieval figure sculptures still in their original setting in England, the sculptures have been cleaned of layers of pollution, protected, and rescued from obscurity. Now, the experiences of visitors and parishioners is enhanced by an informed appreciation of the beauty of the sculptures, and of the skill of their creators. The architects for the project stated that ‘the report that you provided regarding the sculptures on the west front of the ruined nave of Crowland Abbey was invaluable. Not only did it help us in carrying out the repairs to the west front, but the PCC \[Parochial Church Council\] have been able to utilise the information in improving their displays for visitors' \(Anderson and Glenn, architects, 2019, 5.1\). 

 Alexander’s research into Lincoln Cathedral has informed an ambitious collaborative project, funded by the Lottery Heritage Fund, 'Lincoln Connected'. Lincoln Cathedral is ‘a place of unrivalled architecture’ and known as ‘one of the finest surviving medieval cathedrals in Europe’ \(5.2\). Alexander’s work on the cathedral has focused on the role of St Hugh in the architectural development of the site, and has demonstrated conclusively where the medieval shrines were located in the cathedral and what form they took. The Cathedral is using her findings to create a new resource for visitors in the form of a virtual reconstruction of the shrines’ original appearance, which will be made available through iPads used by Cathedral guides as part of the Lincoln Connected project. 

 Pilgrimage to Lincoln's shrines to St Hugh played a vital part in our predecessors' experience as the main reason medieval visitors came to the Cathedral, but is almost impossible to grasp now because little remains to be explored in the building. To be launched in 2021 \(subject to change dependent on the effects of COVID\-19\), the virtual reconstruction will enable visitors to experience a much more detailed and vivid sense of how the building impacted on the lives of ordinary people from the middle ages onwards. The Education Office at Lincoln Cathedral, stated that ‘Dr Alexander’s involvement with the project is important because Lincoln Cathedral is deeply embedded in the hearts and minds of people from around the world as a holy place of worship’ \(5.2\). She further states that the new resource ‘will be a transformational and enriching experience which will deepen public understanding of their ancestors' engagement with the building, and with the power and influence of saints’. Alexander’s research ‘provides historical accuracy and credibility to the project, which in turn, will help the Cathedral meet its conservation and tourism objective’ and ‘will enhance the education and interpretation programme’ \(5.2\). It will have a major impact on raising the cathedral's profile, and Lincoln Cathedral anticipate it attracting an extra 125,000 visitors annually \(5.2\). 

 Furthermore, Alexander produced a commissioned report for English Heritage \(3.5\) in 2012 that informed and enhanced understanding of the construction of Kirby Hall and its relationship to the architecture in the region. Recent decisions about the conservation and presentation of the site have now been directly based on Alexander’s insights, providing an understanding of the historic development of the site, and of the people who constructed it, either as owners or as workers. For Kirby Hall, Alexander’s report ‘helped to refine the phasing of the site…it advanced the methodology used to analyse masons’ marks in the Early Modern period, a field which is still in its infancy…the report does inform the presentation of the site to the visiting public. It has long\-term value and will be taken into account in future restoration or conservation initiatives' \(Head of Historic Places Investigation \(North and East\), Historic England \(previously English Heritage\), 5.3\). 

###  Informing an International Public about Medieval Architecture 

 As a result of her internationally recognised work on medieval and early modern masonry, between 2011 and 2013 Alexander was commissioned to study the early phases of Santiago de Compostela Cathedral in Spain \(3.3\), within the UNESCO world\-heritage site to provide new information about the methods of construction of the cathedral. For the first time the enigmatic masons' marks on the building have been used in a scientific study to show how the building was raised from the quarry. This report has been published in a non\-specialised monograph on the building in Spanish, which was sold at EUR20.80 \(12\-2014\), the price subsidised by the regional government in order to reach a wide audience. The book was popular with visitors, selling 750 copies, and gave new insights into the building for its visitors \(5.4\). Alexander's chapter on the masons' marks has reached a wider audience through articles in the regional press, provided new information to the stone industry through its trade press, and the book is now on a reading list for walkers taking the Pilgrimage to Compostela \(5.5\). The study of the Cathedral is a continuing project, with further research on the building planned once it is safe to do so. 

 Alexander’s research and its influence on sites of historical importance continues to reach broad audiences so much so, her work was featured in The Observer \(print readership: 550,000, circulation: 144,034\) in November 2020 demonstrating Alexander’s standing as a leader in this area. The article, about Alexander’s discovery of a ‘self\-portrait’ of a stonemason at Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, was the most read in The Observer’s online ‘In Culture’ section, and was shared 782 times in the first day after publication \(5.6\). The story was referenced 18 more times in the media across 14 countries, including in the Daily Express \(UK, print readership: 495,000, circulation: 255,621\); The Smithsonian Magazine \(USA, print readership: 6,158,000\); Olhar Digital \(Brazil\); La Nacion \(Argentina, print readership: 465,000\) and Diário de Notícias \(Portugal, print readership: 253,510\). The story was also included in an episode of ‘Have I Got News for You’ broadcast on BBC One, viewed by 4,540,000 people, and this segment was repeated in the show’s end of year review episode \(5.6\). Subsequently, Alexander was interviewed for a video for Follow the Camino, a travel company specialising in tours for people walking the Camino de Santiago routes \(5.6\). Comments on the article on social media demonstrated how the discovery made readers consider the roles of stonemasons: ‘Love this\! Let’s hear it for all the unsung heroes and heroines of history’; ‘somethings just never change. It turns out that we humans aren’t that different from our ancestors after all\!’; ‘the skills of stone masons astound when one looks at these buildings’ \(5.6\). 

 TV, radio and press interviews by Alexander during and after the Notre\-Dame fire in April 2019 reached a global audience and provided expert commentary on the effects of the fire and about the conservation needed. Her article, 'Notre Dame: a history of medieval cathedrals and fire', in *The Conversation,* 18th April 2019, has been read over 4,286 times, demonstrating enhanced public awareness and engagement with the cathedral's conservation issues. Alexander’s commentary on the fire, which was included in an Associated Press article, was referenced 246 times in articles across 11 counties, in publications including The Guardian \(print readership: 573,000, circulation: 134,570\), Daily Mail \(print readership: 2,440,000, circulation: 1,199,760\) The Hindu \(readership 6,226,000, circulation: 1,289,743\), The Hindustan Times \(readership: 18,422,000, circulation: 1,917,876\) and The New York Post \(circulation: 191,495\) \(5.7\). 

 Following this, in recognition of Alexander’s expertise within the field, the research team at Cergy\-Paris University have approached Alexander to collaborate on a research project that will directly inform the reconstruction and restoration of Notre Dame, with specific onus on visitor engagement when reopened. The project, which focuses on the visitor experience at Notre\-Dame, will inform and guide the presentation of the building to the public after it re\-opens once conservation work is completed. Alexander’s expertise continues to inform preservation work to ensure that future generations can enjoy our medieval built heritage in the UK and beyond.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Professor Jian Dai on the design of robot manipulators has led to the development of robotic therapy devices for the treatment of lower limb injuries. Two companies have been founded to develop cutting\-edge healthcare technologies based on this research: Movendo Technology \(Italy\), a large biomedical company which provides rehabilitation devices and effective rehabilitation treatment, and AiTreat Pte Ltd. \(Singapore\), a cutting\-edge robotic massage start\-up. 

 An independent evaluation has found that the robotic devices developed by these companies provide treatment equal to or better than conventional physiotherapy, but at lower cost and more reliable consistency, in particular for diagnosing susceptibility to falls in older people, rehabilitation for patients with Parkinson’s disease after spinal injury and stroke, and rehabilitation after lower limb trauma. 

 In total, more than 11,000 patients have been treated with these robotic devices at over 100 clinics and hospitals in countries including Singapore, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Spain, US, Dubai, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Ukraine. Over 800,000 physiotherapy treatments have been delivered. 

 Movendo Technology has 34 employees and 1,500 agents worldwide, and its annual turnover was EUR2,764,000 in 2019. Its market share is approximately 2%. AiTreat has completed three rounds of VC/Pharma funding, and its 2019 turnover was USD460,000, 60% of which is attributed to Prof. Dai’s technology.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Jian Dai has been working on the mechanism design and orientation and dexterity of robot manipulators ever since he joined King’s College London in 1999. His research, conducted together with his PhD students, post\-doctoral researchers and collaborators, has included both fundamental contributions on relevant modelling and computing methodologies and development of applications in various contexts. This has led to designing novel technologies for rehabilitation and massaging robots. The development and utilization of such robots by Movendo \(rehabilitation robots\) and AiTreat \(massaging robots\) are the subject of this impact case study \(ICS\). 

 Dai’s research underpinning this ICS began in the early 2000s with theoretical work on computational procedures for kinematics and control theory. Dai and Rees Jones \[R1\] presented a new approach for constructing the null space of a linear system of homogeneous equations using the cofactors of an augmented coefficient matrix. Their approach improved on the computational efficiency of the previous methods, by avoiding the Gauss–Seidel elimination algorithm, and on their numerical accuracy. \[R1\] showed how the new method can be applied in kinematics to calculate reciprocal screw systems, providing a theoretical framework for analysis and synthesis of robotic mechanisms. 

 Dai et al. \[R2\] used the method from \[R1\] in designing robotic platforms for ankle rehabilitation and analysing their stiffness. The proposed devices had fewer degrees of freedom than the competing designs, hence fewer actuators and simpler control leading to reduced costs. From the technological viewpoint, the devices integrated various stages of rehabilitation and could be tailored to requirements of physiotherapy. The results from \[R2\] provided technology for the development of robotic rehabilitation systems by Movendo. 

 Saglia et al. \[R3\] proposed control algorithms for redundantly actuated parallel mechanisms. The algorithms were based on inverse kinematics, relied on the accuracy of the proposed mathematical models and numerical procedures for Jacobian matrices, and were calibrated and validated in simulations and experiments. The control algorithms in \[R3\] together with the prototype presented in \[R4\] provided, via the patent US20110306473, the basis for the final design of the Movendo Hunova robotic platform. 

 The analysis of the relationship between force and motion initiated in \[R1\] was used in Zhang et al. \[R5\] in design and analysis of extensible continuum robots, and was further extended in Cui et al. \[R6\] for finger\-rolling contact analysis. \[R5\] and \[R6\] laid foundations for the inverse kinematics formulated as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations in terms of the joint rates of the finger linkage mechanism and the parameters of the contact trajectories. This work provided the basis for designing the massaging device at AiTreat. 

 Li et al. \[R7\], starting again from the results presented in \[R1\], proposed a novel model\-free method based on the adaptive Kalman filter to achieve path tracking for a continuum robot using only pressures and tip position. As the Kalman filter requires only a two\-step algebraic calculation per one control interval, the low computational load and the real\-time control capability were achieved. Simulations and experimental validation showed robustness of this control method against system uncertainties. This work was used by AiTreat in implementing control in their robotic devices. 

 The research underpinning this ICS as described above was supported by EPSRC and EU grants and attracted sponsorship from THK Co. Ltd. Japan for the investigation into robotic massage fingers. The current EPSRC grant EP/S019790/1, awarded jointly to King’s College London and Leeds University, extends further this research, aiming at development of new robotic healthcare devices. Jian Dai received the 2015 ASME Mechanisms and Robotics Award and the 2020 ASME Machine Design Award for his lifelong contribution to the fundamental theory, design and applications of mechanisms and robotics systems.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Two companies have been founded to exploit Prof. Dai’s underpinning research: Movendo and AiTreat. In each company, one of the co\-founders was a former research student of Prof. Dai. Each company has developed its own therapy robot. While much of the underlying research is similar, they use two quite different applications of robot technology with Movendo concentrating on a rehabilitation platform whereas the AiTreat robot delivers massage and acupuncture. 

 An independent evaluation has found that research at King’s led directly, and via the careers of the two former students and the technology of the two firms, to high quality products which benefits thousands of patients globally per annum. The larger part of the underlying technology is directly attributable to King’s research, although both firms also have added substantially to that core, for example in diagnostics and supporting clinical workflows, as well as extending clinical applications. However, it is unlikely that either firm would ever have been started or developed its technologies without the research inputs from King’s. \[S1, p.19\] 

 <ins> **Movendo</ins><ins>: technology development</ins><ins>, founding</ins><ins>, investment</ins> <ins>and company</ins> <ins>growth**</ins> 

 Research conducted by Prof. Dai and his then PhD student Dr Jody Saglia \[R3\] \(based on \[R1, R2\]\) led to a key patent. The work attracted investment of over EUR10,000,000 from the Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work \(INAIL\), that was helping to develop the ankle rehabilitation device “Arbot” and ran a successful RCT \(Randomised Control Trial\) on orthopaedic post\-traumatic patients with lower limb injuries. The clinical trial and the patent led to the development of a new device for total body rehabilitation, Hunova, based on the core technology of the ankle rehabilitation device “Arbot” and the Patent. Hunova was been developed and clinically validated at the Italian Institute of Technology by a team including Dr Saglia, who raised EUR10,000,000 in corporate venture funding from Dompé Pharmaceuticals, one of the main Italian biopharmaceutical groups \[S7\] to start a new company, Movendo Technology, in late 2016. \[S2\] 

 Movendo Technology acquired an exclusive license for the Arbot and Hunova technology and now operates globally to commercialise its solutions in the rehabilitation market. Hunova is Movendo Technology’s principal product. It targets rehabilitation of the lower limbs, from ankle to knee and hip, the pelvis, and trunk, by providing a large variety of training modalities. \[S6\] 

 Movendo Technology Group employs 34 people \(as of 31 July 2020\), and annual turnover rose from EUR1,292,000 in 2017 to EUR2,764,000 in 2019. Its market share is approximately 2% \[S11\]. To date, it has sold 69 units. In addition to its core staff, Movendo employs around 1,500 agents worldwide. \[S10\] 

 In total, more than 10,000 patients have been treated at over 100 clinics and hospitals in countries including Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Spain, US, Dubai, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Ukraine. Over 800,000 physiotherapy treatments have been delivered. \[S11\] 

 Dr Saglia, Movendo Technology, co\-founder and former CTO \[S2\]: 

 *“Prof. Dai’s contribution has been significant along the entire journey \- from the very beginning of the concept idea to the final product design passing through clinical validation. This is a clear example of world leading research being successfully transferred to the industrial world, making a real impact on society. \[Today\] Movendo is continuously fostering a research and technology development collaboration with Prof. Dai’s group for its future products.”* 

 <ins> **AiTreat</ins><ins>: Technology development</ins><ins>, founding, investment</ins> <ins>and company</ins> <ins>growth**</ins> 

 AiTreat Pte Ltd. \(Singapore\) has developed EMMA, a massage robot based on the technology proposed in \[R5, R6, R7\] by Prof. Dai and his PhD student, Chen Qiu. Following the receipt of an ACE Grant from SPRING Singapore \(2015\), the company has now completed three rounds of fundraising with the last round of investments coming from Brain Robotics Capital LP \(a prestigious US VC\), Tasly Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd \(Shanghai\) and Ogawa Smart Healthcare Technology Group Co Ltd \(Shenzhen\). \[S8\] 

 *“EMMA is AiTreat’s primary development and the first successful one of its kind in the world. EMMA is a state\-of\-the\-art soft tissue therapeutic treatment system that utilizes robotic technology and medical knowledge that is stored using Artificial Intelligence. \[…\] EMMA is equipped with sensors to measure muscle stiffness and uses 3D vision technology to analyze the patient’s body.”* \[AiTreat website, quoted in \[S1, p.6\]\] 

 AiTreat Pte Ltd. has produced several generations of the massaging robot EMMA in four clinics in Singapore, with over 1,000 customers and over 5,000 times of use \[S9\]. The company turnover is USD460,000, 60% of which is due to using Prof. Dai’s technology. \[S9\] 

 AiTreat Pte Ltd was the winner of the Microsoft Developer Day Start\-up Competition \(2016\), winner of 'Best Product/Application Design Award' at Shanghai International Start\-up Competition \(2016\), and recipient of a StartupSG Tech Grant from Enterprise Singapore \(2017\). \[S8\] 

 <ins> **Benefits of the robotic systems</ins> <ins>to medical practitioners and patients**</ins> 

 The key benefits cited by practitioners who use the robotic systems are \[S1, p.9\]: 

-  Treating more patients, with better health outcomes. *“Combining several types of fingering including thumbing, index fingering and palm motion in one for massaging to provide versatile massage treatments using one end\-effector, multiple types of massage, ... what this does is improve efficiency, enabling a large number of treatments.”* \[CTO of AiTreat, quoted in \[S1, p.16\]\] 

-  Cost savings for clinics and patients 

-  Treatment equal to the best physiotherapist, but cheaper and easier to reproduce consistently. *""Treatment from our robots is about equivalent to the best treatment from the best physiotherapist but the latter is unreliable, expensive and hard to reproduce. Some traditional treatments require two to three persons to implement.""* \[Director, Sales and Marketing, Movendo, quoted in \[S1, p.16\]\] 

-  Consistent standard of treatment. *""For example, \[… with traditional treatment …\] we give them exercises, \[some\] people don't do it, or we prescribe some random massage, it helps for a few days. But maybe it \[results in\] a misalignment of ligaments. We prescribe sessions on Emma for the back, and then acupuncture, with very good results.""* \[CTO of AiTreat, quoted in \[S1, p.16\]\] 

-  The flexibility of the robotic systems. *“Adaptability \- we can change from simulating rubber bands to swimming in a pool with the flick of a switch”* \[Director, Sales and Marketing, Movendo, quoted in \[S1, p.9\]\] 

 The clinical efficacy of the Movendo devices is documented in published research as at least equivalent and sometimes better than conventional treatment, in particular for: 

-  Diagnosing susceptibility to falls in older people \[S3\] 

-  Rehabilitation for patients with Parkinson’s disease, after spinal injury and stroke \[S4\] 

-  Rehabilitation after lower limb trauma \[S5\] 

 Clinicians report that patients respond favourably to the robot treatment. *“Patients are intrigued…They like the consistency and the \[lack of \] worry about who \[they\] will get. We get a lot of word of mouth; they bring their friends.”* \[AiTreat clinician, quoted in \[S1, p.15\]\] 

 The independent evaluation concludes: 

 *“The two firms provide robotic technology, based substantially on research from KCL, which is part of a wave of clinical robotics which is likely to massively influence or even revolutionise the way clinical massage and acupuncture are delivered, and may extend beyond those core applications.”* \[S1, p.19\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 “Mastery” teaching in mathematics is a UK government initiative with the ambition to eradicate under\-achievement. University of Bristol research has shaped the UK’s National Centre for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics \(NCETM\) Professional Development materials and resources for primary schools which have become the definitive interpretation of mastery teaching in England. The materials are backed by the Department for Education \(DfE\) and heavily influenced the new DfE/NCETM Primary Mathematics National Curriculum guidance. The materials are in use by a network of 40 Maths Hubs and 8,000 primary schools in England, with preliminary evidence of improvement in student understanding and attainment. The approach also informed primary schools maths textbooks in Mexico used by 4.5 million children. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Under\-achievement of students in mathematics is a fundamental problem in the UK. In England, a stubborn 20% of each cohort, by age 15, attain levels of numeracy judged internationally not to be suitable for life in a modern society \(Level 1 or below on PISA tests\). We know that social mobility is linked directly to attainment in mathematics, with the subject acting as gatekeeper for access to Higher Education and professional qualification. Coles’ research, in collaboration with Sinclair \(Simon Fraser University Vancouver\), has showed that one reason for this under\-achievement is that mathematical concepts can be presented to students in incoherent ways or in ways that do not match well with children’s lived experiences. Their research calls into question prevalent assumptions about curriculum organisation and teaching approaches, both within the academic community and current school practices. There are three strands to their research findings and conceptual arguments: 

#  What is a number? 

 Children’s first engagements with number in the early years of primary school tend to be in contexts of answering “how many?” questions. Yet outside school, it is clear that meaningful experiences include, for example, engaging in number as an ordered sequence \(e.g. reciting “one\-two\-three…”, etc\) in which quantity is less important than how one number relates to its neighbours. Coles and Sinclair have conducted empirical studies which indicate that ways in which children operate with numbers are often beyond curriculum expectations, raising concerns that the expectation of linear progression can lead to lack of exposure to more sophisticated techniques \[2\]. Their research makes the case for offering children a balance of exposure to number as a relation or measure, and number as linked to objects or quantity \[5, 6\]. 

#  The role of place value 

 A significant barrier to children’s progress in mathematics occurs if they cannot interpret the written form of two\-digit numbers \(e.g. 23\) to indicate two tens and three units. Typically work on place value makes use of materials that emphasises number as object and quantity. Empirical work carried out by Coles and Sinclair has highlighted alternative and powerful routes to becoming successful with place value conventions that draw on children’s facility with language and gesture – building on how numbers relate to one another in a naming structure, more than how numbers relate to objects. For instance, they have demonstrated the benefits of working with a “dual naming” of the numbers 11\-99, that makes the place value component of these numbers linguistically explicit \(e.g., “23” has the dual names of “twenty\-three” and “two\-ty three”\) \[4, 6\]. Their research has helped to de\-mystify what is involved in understanding place value, for instance, that the “place” of a number indicates its value only in a number’s written form, whereas in spoken language, it is labels \(such as “hundred”\) that indicate value \(and e.g., phrases such as “four and twenty” are meaningful, where the standard place is swapped\). 

#  Developmental assumptions 

 Coles and Sinclair have brought into question assumptions, prevalent across many countries, that learning in mathematics must proceed from operations on concrete objects, into work with abstract and dis\-embodied concepts \[3\]. Their critique suggests, for example, that there is no basis for current practices of excluding some students from “abstract” mathematics on the basis that they are not ready for it. They show how choices of tool use and ways of working can disrupt typical orders in which students learn particular concepts \[2\] such that, for instance, student facility with what is usually taken to be ‘concrete’ and ‘abstract’ might take place simultaneously. Their research demonstrates how uses of particular representations and digital tools prompts students’ creative use of number concepts and their mathematical reasoning \[1\]. They have shown how children, across a range of levels of prior attainment, can be supported to reason about and discuss mathematical ideas that would usually be seen as beyond them \[6\] *if* the mathematics is offered and represented in a structured and coherent manner \[1\]. Their research proposes a novel conception of how children come to be successful at mathematics, avoiding past dualist separations of thought and action.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Coles’ research has directly informed education policy in England. This has led to improvements in mathematical teaching practices in English primary schools, which in turn is having a positive impact on student outcomes. 

#  Informing education policy in England 

 Coles’ research shaped the development of the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics \(NCETM\) Primary Mastery Professional Development \(PD\) materials \[A, B\], which “ *are supported by the Department for Education and will be disseminated via the 35 Maths Hub across England”* \[B\]. These resources then *‘heavily influenced’* the new NCETM and Department for Education \(DfE\) Primary Mathematics National Curriculum Guidance Document \(2020\) \[I, J\], as set out below. The research has made a distinct and material contribution to the content of the professional development materials and curriculum guidance in three ways: 

 *A broader conception of number:* following directly from Coles and Sinclair’s arguments \[1, 2 & 5\], there is an explicit balance between different concepts of number in the materials. In particular, the PD materials \[A\] are explicit that teachers should be offering students experiences of “number as object” \(a concept\) at the same time as experiences of “number as length” \(a more relational concept\) \[2, 5\]. For instance, the very first teaching point of the Addition and Subtraction “spine” addresses number as a measure, *before* introducing number as linked to objects \(e.g. see “Spine 1 overview” in \[A\]; National Curriculum Guidance \[I\], pp.20\-23, work on numbers 1\-20 as location and length, before object\), a reversal of the historically typical order. 

 *Downplaying place value:* whereas the National Curriculum has a separate strand for “Place Value” within learning number in primary school, in the NCETM PD materials there is no separate “place value” strand \[4\] \(the three current “spines” \[A\] subsume all National Curriculum targets for place value\). Work on place value is embedded within strands of other number work, serving to downplay its importance, as called for by Coles and Sinclair \[4\]. Their proposals for a “dual naming” of numbers 11\-99 \[6\] has been written into the materials and guidance now going to all primary schools \(Spine 1, Section 1.9 \[A\]\). In line with their recommendations, the order of the NCETM materials \(Spine 1, Section 1.9 and 1.10\) mean that children will now work on the numbers 20\-100, which are mainly named regularly \(e.g. “43” is said “four”/”ty”/”three”; “95” is said “nine”/”ty”/”five”\) before coming back to work on the irregularly named numbers from 10\-19 \(also see National Curriculum Guidance \[I\], pp.18\-19\). 

 *Use of resources and representations:* one of the resources proposed by Coles and Sinclair is the “Gattegno Tens Chart”, as a device for allowing both a linguistic approach to place value and a device that allows teachers and students to work directly on ‘abstract’ elements of number structure \[1, 6\]. In the NCETM materials there is significant use of the “Gattegno Tens Chart” in the materials \[1, 6\], \(e.g. see Spine 1, Section 1.8, Teaching point 3, from \[A\]; and National Curriculum Guidance \[I\], p.19\). The chart is also explicitly mentioned as one of the core representations of number that should be used consistently throughout the primary years and extending into the first years of secondary school. 

#  Improved maths pedagogy of primary teachers in England 

 All the NCETM materials are freely available on their website, with approximately 24,000 downloads per month \(comprising approximately 100,000 individual files\) \[Hi\], and over 8,000 primary schools engaged with the mastery programme \[J\]. Coles has run professional development activities supporting teachers to understand the basis of the new approaches to learning mathematics, for example keynote talks at conferences and conference sessions \(Jurassic Maths Hub conference, June 2020; Cabot Learning Federation Mathematics Meeting, March 2018; South West Primary Maths Conference, November 2017; Boolean Hub Conference, January 2017\) \[F\]. The NCETM materials are not statutory and the level of take\-up by schools \(over half of all primary schools\) \[J\], is evidence of their relevance to teachers. 

 There is evidence of primary teachers making use of the materials, including some who were sceptical of their value but are *“now their biggest fans”* and can see *“how confident the Year 1s were in their maths talking and reasoning”* \[Ci, Cii\]. In a recent evaluation involving 5 schools the impact “… *on teachers was felt particularly on their subject knowledge, confidence, and the precision of their teaching. In these schools there was evidence that students are behaving in ways that have not been seen before, in terms of their enjoyment of mathematics, their confidence in the subject, … and in terms of their ability to use reasoning and mathematical language*.” \[Ci\]. An ESRC Impact Acceleration Award \[i\] led to a report by Coles on one ‘early adopter’ school’s experiences with the materials. Positive impacts were found on teachers in the school and there was evidence of changes in teaching practice, linked to a professional cycle using the materials, trialled through the ESRC IAA project \[i\]. This evaluation evidence was also reported in the NCETM Newsletter \[D \(p.9\-16\)\] and sent to all primary schools in England. 

 The NCETM now has 40 Maths Hubs \[Hiii\] and in each one there is a group of teachers from six or seven different schools working on primary mastery in “Teaching for Mastery Work Groups”, including the use and implementation of the materials \(overall, therefore, involving teachers in approximately 240 schools\) \[Hii\]. Testimony of teachers running these groups \[Hii, J\] points to impact on teacher knowledge, teaching practice and resulting increase of confidence of students in mathematics. The Director of the NCETM observed: *““Feedback from teachers about the materials has been overwhelmingly positive, suggesting that the materials have helped to improve teachers’ mathematical subject knowledge, as well as improving their pedagogical subject knowledge and supporting them to developing their pedagogical skills*.” \[J\]. These impacts are corroborated by a report from the NCETM, conducted independently, which summarised interviews with mathematics leads in five primary schools \[Ci\]. Themes in this report include changes in teachers’ understanding of the power of representations to become tools for children’s thinking, rather than supports for algorithmic procedures: “ *We have always used the base 10 resources alongside a pictorial representation but in previous years that felt more like the method rather than the concept. Now it feels like \[the representation\] is there to support but lots of them are doing it mentally. I am not saying the ‘win’ is doing it mentally but being able to step back from it”* \[Ci\]. The teachers across the schools spoke about the PD materials changing their approach to teaching mathematics and their own understanding of number: *“Teacher subject knowledge has definitely improved, especially for teachers who are early in their career. I think they have got a much better understanding of the structure of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division; I think that is the biggest thing, that they are understanding”* \[Ci\]. 

 Further national impact comes through Coles’ work with the professional body the Association of Teachers of Mathematics, for whose magazine he writes regularly \[E\] and for whom he has run research presentations, at local and national conferences, both prior to and since 2014 \(e.g. February 2015, Birmingham ATM branch \[60 teachers\]; March 2011, ATM plenary speaker \[450 attendees\]\), influencing mathematics teachers and their approaches. 

#  Increased pupil mastery in mathematics 

 Emerging evidence reveals the direct benefits to the students whose experience of learning mathematics is conceptually coherent, supporting attainment and opportunities for mathematical reasoning \[C, H\]. Teachers in the NCETM report \[Ci\] spoke about never before having seen students understand and reason about mathematics in the way that they did when the PD materials were used as the basis for lesson planning: 

 *“I have taught the same things for the past five years and this is the only year I can actually say they have really understood fractions thanks to the division and multiplication that went before it”* 

 *”...you realise that if you give them the language structure then they can reason, if you don’t what hope have they got, but the materials offer that structure, and you have all these visuals that you can compare and talk about”* 

 *“...blown away by how \[students\] were able to discuss mathematics at the end of year 1 in a way \[we\] had not seen a year 1 class do before”.* 

#  Informing international education policy and practice 

 The overall approach to teaching and learning mathematics has also influenced the development of textbooks in Mexico and in particular the Teacher Guides which, along with the national textbooks, are mandated by the Mexican government for use in all schools, thereby shaping mathematics teaching and learning strategies that reach 4.5 million primary school children \[G\].  The textbook author noted Coles’ work *“on the development of classroom cultures and on learning mathematics \(and early number\) led to advice to teachers to promote cultures in which students explore mathematical structure and where making mistakes is part of doing \(and therefore learning\) mathematics\)”* \[G\].

 **1. Summary of the impact**

 \(Image credit: Royal Scottish Academy website\) 

 Tom Normand’s research on Scottish art and the history of the Royal Scottish Academy \(RSA\) has contributed new understandings of the legacy and present\-day relevance of this institution, promoting its role as a leading space for the cultivation, preservation and dissemination of Scottish artistic heritage. This is exemplified by the exhibition **Ages of Wonder. Scotland’s Art 1540 to Now* \(RSA, 4 November 2017\-7 January 2018\), co\-curated by Normand and inspired by his research. 

 The *Ages of Wonder* exhibition and the research and collaborative work that led to its conception and realisation have: 

 **1.** **Generated curatorial strategies and institutional capacity building** through a research\-driven exhibition plan and partnership between the RSA and the National Galleries of Scotland, in collaboration with the universities of St Andrews, Edinburgh and Dundee **,** which leveraged GBP160,000 in funding to support a public\-facing exhibition featuring 440 artworks, conservation work on over 100 RSA collection’s artworks and digitisation of 98 books and albums, as well as the single biggest exhibition\-related expansion of the RSA collections \(117 new artworks\) via funded commissions and donations. 

 **2.** **Enhanced public knowledge and appreciation of Scottish art and the history and legacy of the RSA** through the engagement of 67,178 people \(visitors \- general public, school children and artists\), who participated in over 18 live artistic events, 28 tours and visits, 4 talks and 1 symposium. The exhibition and its programme of activities were widely covered in Scottish print and social media, TV and radio, and specialised reviews with unanimously positive praise. This success led to wider dissemination through two touring exhibitions reaching seven venues across Scotland. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Investigating the history of Scotland’s rich artistic heritage, from ancient times to the contemporary world, has been and continues to be central to the research agenda developed by the School of Art History at St Andrews. Since joining the school in the early 1980s, Tom Normand’s research has contributed to this collective work, focusing on the history of Scottish art and its engagements with Scottish history, national identity, and artistic internationalism. 

 Normand’s work since 2000 has led to a greatly revised and expanded understanding of one of the key institutions in the promotion of Scottish art and the development of Scotland’s cultural identity: the Royal Scottish Academy \(RSA\), founded in 1826. A major academic book published by Normand in 2000 revealed the central role that RSA academicians played in the development of early twentieth\-century Scottish art \(R1\), while wider\-circulation publications on Scottish photography \(2007\) and on particular academicians have offered new interpretations of more recent artists \(R2, R3\). Following up on the sense that close attention to the art of RSA academicians could also offer “ *an index of the history of Scottish art \[…\] and as such a representation of the quality and character of Scotland’s visual culture*” \(R4\), in the early 2010s Normand began a multi\-year project on the history of the RSA. Normand initially published a book on works from the diploma collection of the RSA \(2012\) that shed new light on the range and quality of the RSA collection \(R4\). Normand’s research on the RSA and its wider context and legacy also informed his contribution to a major survey on British art \(R5\). 

 In late 2013 Normand’s project developed into a collaboration with the RSA and associated scholars around Scotland, with Normand proposing an exhibition and publication that would provide a comprehensive new account of the history of the RSA, one that would fully recognize it as a valuable constituent of the culture of the nation. The resulting book \(R6\) – edited by Normand and including two essays by him – charted the history and character of the academy’s collections, set these in the context of the social and cultural history of Scotland, and provided new high\-quality illustrations of many significant but inaccessible works, many of which had been kept in storage for years.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Tom Normand’s research on Scottish art and the history of the Royal Scottish Academy \(RSA\) \(see section 2\) led to the co\-curation of the exhibition *Ages of Wonder. Scotland’s Art 1540 to Now,* 4 November 2017\-7 January 2018. According to the RSA, this was “ *the largest exhibition of its collections in its history as an institution*” \(S1, p. 5\). It was praised as “ *undoubtedly a hallmark exhibition, not only for this particular institution but for the exhibitional history of Scotland in general*” \(S2, p. 6\). 

 Normand’s research and the *Ages of Wonder* exhibition, including the collaborative work that led to its conception and realisation, have contributed to \(1\) the generation of curatorial strategies and institutional capacity building, and \(2\) the enhancement of public knowledge and appreciation of Scottish art and the history and legacy of the RSA. 

 **1. Generation of curatorial strategies and institutional capacity building** 

 **Scottish cultural heritage representation and interpretation through a collaborative partnership which resulted in the **Ages of Wonder** exhibition \(late 2013\-2018\)** 

 Since 2000, Normand has not only published four books and a number of essays on modern Scottish art \(R1\-R6\), but has built relationships with multiple Royal Scottish Academicians and major figures in the Scottish art world, being made an Honorary Royal Scottish Academician in 2010. In late 2013, Normand first proposed an exhibition to the RSA, intending to examine the history of this institution through an exploration of its collections. The starting point of the exhibition would be a historical event: the 1910 transfer of artworks from the RSA to the National Galleries of Scotland \(NGS\). Normand reworked the proposal over the next two years in dialogue with the RSA President, Collections Curator, and Director. Normand’s historical research into the collection and insights into the significance of the 1910 transfer of works thus formed the basis for the exhibition and subsequent research. This was then developed by Normand as co\-curator alongside the RSA team in partnership with the NGS, who together leveraged GBP160,000 in funding for the exhibition \(S1, pp. 51\-53\). Among the curatorial plans conceived and implemented was the idea of staging live artistic practice in the galleries as a reminder of the RSA’s pedagogical remit, and devoting a gallery to a recreation of how artworks would have been displayed in Victorian times \(the “Victorian hang”\) \(S1, p. 7\). In the final stages of exhibition development, Normand took the lead on research on specific works to be displayed and for the exhibition publication, to which he contributed as author and editor \(R6\). The exhibition project also benefited from the collaboration of the universities of St Andrews, Edinburgh and Dundee. In addition to Normand’s key input, the University of St Andrews contributed to the funding of the above\-mentioned exhibition publication \(S1, p. 53\). The University of Edinburgh collaborated through the loan of artworks for the exhibition \(S1, pp. 27\-28\). Both the universities of Edinburgh and Dundee collaborated in educational events, and contributed to two of the exhibition’s live activities: the Live Life School \(drawing\) and the Live Printmaking \(more about these below\), which featured artists and students from the Edinburgh College of Art and the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, Dundee \(S1, pp. 18\-19, 21\). 

 The *Ages of Wonder* exhibition ran from 4 November 2017 to 7 January 2018 and occupied the whole of the RSA building, “ *a powerful statement of its own*,” as one reviewer remarked \(S3, p. 3\). Featuring 440 artworks, including RSA artworks transferred to the NGS in 1910 as well as other works acquired by the RSA throughout its existence, it was “ *the largest exhibition ever of its \[RSA’s\] own collection, which represents one of the most significant assemblies of Scottish art in the world*” \(S4, p. 3\). The exhibition received praise for its novel and original curatorial approach, with one reviewer, from *Expose Art Magazine,* highlighting how *Ages of Wonder* “ *unfurls the undeniably interesting history of the Academy in a manner which distances itself from the norms of traditional exhibitional practices*” \(S2, p. 3\). Commenting on Normand’s contributions to the exhibition project as a whole, the RSA President at the time states: “ *In forty years of collaboration in artists’ publishing, exhibition\-making and cultural infrastructure, developing Ages of Wonder with Tom was one of the most satisfying projects. I must stress the importance of his contribution, not only* *in the book but also to the form and content of the exhibition, particularly in interpretive texts and through his contributions to the catalogue*” \(S5, p. 3\). 

 **Cultural heritage preservation through conservation work on the RSA collection \(2014\-2018\)** 

 As part of the *Ages of Wonder* exhibition a range of new conservation projects on the RSA’s collection was undertaken: 90 artworks were given professional conservation treatment, 98 books and albums were digitised, and 100 artworks were given new mounts and frames \(S1, pp. 11\-17\). *Ages of Wonder* served as a catalyst and provided a framework for such conservation work to be funded and executed. 

 This conservation work has enhanced the usability of these artworks, enabling them to be displayed and studied in the future, and ensuring that their place in Scotland’s art history is foregrounded as a result. It has also allowed for RSA to develop new strategies for the care of the collection. In the words of the RSA collections’ Chief Curator: “ *When the proposal that led to Ages of Wonder was first received from Tom Normand in late 2013, it focused attention on directing annual budgets towards more conservation to ensure the best of the collections were available to be exhibited. \[...\] \[T\]he outcome of the project was not only a better preserved collection – with more items receiving conservation in period than ever before – but a better understanding of where strategies of care needed developed into the future*” \(S6, p. 2\). 

 **Cultural heritage creation through the expansion of the RSA collection** **\(2017\-19\)** 

 The new attention given to the RSA as a result of the research and exhibition offered an unprecedented opportunity for the expansion of its collection. *Ages of Wonder* brought 117 new artworks through a mixture of funded commissions and exhibition\-related events \(S1, pp. 25\-29\). “ *More than any other exhibition*”, the RSA has commented, “ *and second only to major bequests and gifts from artists’ studios, Ages of Wonder has had the single biggest impact on the development of the collections in the RSA’s history*” \(S1, p. 32\). 

 Among these commissions, Scottish artist Calum Colvin’s studio installation within the RSA building served as inspiration for a new commission beyond *Ages of Wonder*: an in\-gallery installation by Colvin for the Andrew Carnegie Birthplace Museum in Dunfermline \(2018\) \(S1, p. 14\). Another work especially commissioned for the *Ages of Wonder* exhibition, Richard Murphy’s display cabinet *Wunderkammer*, has created permanent display potential for around 60\-70 RSA collections’ objects \(S1, p. 13\). 

 **2. Enhancement of public knowledge and appreciation of Scottish art and the history and legacy of the RSA \(2017\-2019\)** 

 **Building awareness of Scottish art through** **audiences’ engagement with the exhibition and participation in its programme of activities \(2017\-2018\)** 

 New knowledge and appreciation of the RSA and its role in the history of Scottish art was communicated primarily through the *Ages of Wonder* exhibition and its companion publications \(an illustrated exhibition catalogue and the volume of essays edited by Normand\). The importance of the exhibition and its ability to reach broad audiences and reshape their views of Scottish art were demonstrated, first, by its attendance figures: 67,178 people \(general public\) visited the exhibition over 63 days \(average of 1,066 people per day\), “ *the highest number of visitors for any full building RSA exhibition since visitor numbers began to be recorded for Annual Exhibitions in the RSA Annual Reports*” \(S1, p. 40\). This compares with 27,264 people \(visitors\) over 38 days \(average of 717 people per day\) for the RSA’s most recent free exhibition, the 2013 RSA Annual Exhibition \(S1, p. 40\), and approximately 54,000 people \(visitors\) over 101 days for the NGS’s 2017 *Beyond Caravaggio* exhibition \(average of 534 people per day\) \(S7, p. 25\). The RSA Visitor Book recorded a varied audience, comprising predominantly local Scottish/British members of the public as well as a number of international visitors: “ *Amazing way to make us understand the art*”, reported a visitor from Mexico; “ *I liked the Battle of Bannockburn  \[...\] I have been learning about it at school*”, stated a Scottish visitor; “ *Impressive in range and size. Inspired me to pick up a membership form*”, said another Scottish visitor; “ *Incredible experience compared to most major exhibitions”; “Deeply awe inspired by some of the work*” \(S1, pp. 64\-66\). 

 Knowledge and appreciation of the RSA and Scottish art was also communicated through the programme of activities associated with *Ages of Wonder*, which included 14 tours, 14 educational visits, 4 talks and 1 symposium, aimed at the general public, school\-aged children and adult learners \(S1, pp. 21\-22\). Worth noting was a series of artist\-led live events, the Live Life School and the Live Printmaking, where 9 life drawing sessions and 22 printmaking sessions were demonstrated in the galleries, in front of the audience, often with the public joining in – echoing the RSA’s centuries\-old role as a teaching institution \(S1, pp. 18\-19\). According to the Visitor Survey, 30 people \(general public\) responding out of 136 \(22% of respondents\) highlighted the life drawing and printing sessions as particularly appealing \(S1, pp. 60\-63\). 

 **Informing the wider public through** **press coverage and specialised reviews \(2017\-2018\)** 

 *Ages of Wonder* attracted the attention of the Scottish media, including newspaper, radio, and television coverage \(e.g. cover of *The Scotsman*; airtime on STV News and BBC Radio Scotland; features in *The Herald*, *The Times*, *Metro*, *The National*, *Edinburgh Evening News*, *Edinburgh Reporter*\) as well as reviews in specialised publications and fora \( *Scottish Art News*, *Books & Ideas*, *Expose Art Magazine*, *Georgina Coburn Arts*\) \(S1, pp. 37\-39\). Reviews were unanimously positive: “Ages of Wonder *leads us through the many and diverse ways in which the Academy in its long history has championed and still champions the cause of the visual arts in Scotland*” \(S8, p. 2\); “ *an exhibition brimming with possibilities in terms of how we might perceive and celebrate Scottish Art differently*” \(S3, p. 4\); “ *The idea of the Wunderkammer \[cabinet of wonders\] is, indeed, a rather apt analogy for the entire exhibition*” \(S9, p. 3\). 

 **Wider dissemination to rural parts of Scotland \(2018\-2019\)**. 

 Elements of the *Ages of Wonder* exhibition connected with the life drawing and printing live events toured Scotland to bring portions of the exhibit to areas where major examples of Scottish art are hard to access, due to their distance from the major museums and galleries of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The touring exhibition *The Art of Etching* was hosted in 5 venues, while *The Life School* was hosted in 3 venues \(S1, pp. 23\-24\). Feedback from at least 3 of these venues, located in the towns of Ayr \(on the south west coast of Scotland\) and Linlithgow \(in the south east\), indicates that these exhibitions received highly positive responses from visitors and brought in far higher than usual audience numbers to the venues. The *Art of Etching* exhibition attracted 5,439 people \(general public visitors\) at the Maclaurin Art Gallery in Ayr. Reflecting how this touring exhibition heightened the sense of local identity and local culture, one visitor noted: “ *Amazing to have 1st touring show from RSA – including “our” Brydens*” \[re: Scottish artist Robert Bryden \(1865–1939\)\]. Regarding the *Life School* exhibition in Ayr \(1,994 people \(general public\)\), another visitor noted: “Great exhibition\! – especially as RSA touring Scotland and bringing this to our area\!\!” \(S10, pp. 2\-3\). And in relation to the *Life School* exhibition in Linlithgow, a report from West Lothian Council’s Music and Public Art Officer states that “ *we have had 4,706 \[people\] visitors for the duration of the show, which is almost twice as many as we usually have for a single exhibition*” \(S10, p. 5\). 

 Rooted in Normand’s research on Scottish art and with his input as co\-curator, the *Ages of Wonder* exhibition has helped to change public perception and appreciation of the legacy of this institution and the history of Scottish art more broadly, while contributing to preserving and expanding the RSA collections for present\-day and future generations.

#  2. Underpinning research 

##  2.1 Construction of MAP1 and MAP2 computers for CERN at the University of Liverpool 

 At the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the computing infrastructure at CERN required to support its next generation of particle physics experiments represented a formidable challenge. In 2000, this challenge was partially addressed by the University of Liverpool through the construction of Europe’s first commodity off\-the\-shelf computer – MAP1 in Liverpool’s Department of Physics. 

 MAP1’s novel architecture incorporated high\-density packing of computing hardware whilst enabling easy access and efficient cooling. MAP1 enabled the creation of a grid of low\-cost computer centres with a huge compute cycle capability and was, in part, a catalyst for the £120M UK e\-Science programme in late 2000. 

 In 2003, as part of e\-Science programme developments, Bowcock’s research team at Liverpool was awarded a Science Research Investment Fund grant of £1.3M to further develop MAP1 into MAP2, which was commissioned in 2003. MAP2 comprised of 940 computation nodes, 100 terabytes disc space and had 30 times the computing power of MAP1. In November 2003, MAP2 was ranked as the 22<sup>nd</sup> most powerful academic computer in the world and the 86<sup>th</sup> most powerful computer worldwide **.** 

 The benefits of MAP2 compared to MAP1, included: 

-  Improved \(custom\) Flow Control Software \(FCS\) enabling the integration of many thousands of PC’s. Software included queue management and system maintenance. 

-  Use of a centralised telecommunications grade network switch \(Force10\) with over 100’s of additional commodity switches compared to MAP1. This design and architecture was incorporated in the LHCb particle physics experiment at CERN. 

##  2.2 Application of Liverpool’s MAP2 computer to research at CERN’s LHCb experiment 

 MAP2’s original scientific purpose was to design a revised Vertex Locator \(VELO\) detector for the LHCb experiment at CERN **\[3.1\]**, as well as for processing in condensed matter physics **\[3.2\].** MAP2 facilitated detailed optimisation studies into the VELO detector geometry layout and detector strip resolution, as well as investigations into optimum thickness of support structures. From 2010\-2018, LHCb relied on the VELO modules for its primary tracking **\[3.3\]** \(Bowcock, Shears, et al.\). MAP2 was used to underpin other essential aspects of particle physics experiments such as providing the CPU requirements of full event simulation for the ATLAS and LHCb experiments at CERN **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]**, including the trigger design of LHCb **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.6\].** 

##  2.3 Establishment of AIMES Centre to assist SMEs with computing technology adoption 

 MAP2 demonstrated that \- using its software and networking stack, and mechanical and cooling configuration \- it was possible to create world\-class computing facilities for private sector organisations. This level of computing technology had previously been out of reach for SMEs and many large companies. Time\-to\-solution for computing technology was a significant problem for UK industry in the early 2000s. This was recognised by the North West Development Agency \(NWDA\) and the European Commission as the technical justification for funding the formation of the **A**dvanced **I**nternet **M**ethods and **E**mergent **S**ystems \( **AIMES**\) Centre. 

 The AIMES Centre was established as a collaboration at Liverpool between the Department of Physics and the Management School, and secured funding of £7.8M \(£2M from ERDF, £5.8M from NWDA\) in 2003. Bowcock was the founding Technical Director of the Centre. The AIMES Centre focussed on assisting SMEs with the adoption of new computing technology and on creating business start\-ups capable of exploiting new markets. Its objectives included the optimisation of supply chains within the automotive and aerospace sectors, as well as the optimisation of intensive care resources and delivery of care for Alder Hey Children’s Hospital. 

##  2.4 Formation of AIMES Grid Services Ltd and development of Trustworthy Research Environments for the healthcare sector 

 In 2005, the AIMES Centre became a standalone commercial operation and was renamed AIMES Grid Services Ltd. In 2012, AIMES developed the *Health Cloud* – a dedicated virtual environment that enables NHS Trusts to use cloud computing technologies and manage sensitive data in a secure governed environment. In 2016, AIMES extended its Health Cloud capability to create digital infrastructures known as Trustworthy Research Environments \(TREs\) – secure platforms, where sensitive health data can be ingested. 

 The TRE provides a secure, computational powerful and stable platform to store, access and analyse confidential data. Importantly, it also meets common data standards, information governance and legal requirements for the storage and use of health data, which allows users to perform detailed data analysis using bespoke analytics tools. Without the TRE, data analysts will have no other choice but to download a snapshot of some data on their own local hard drives; this can be risky and insecure due to data confidentiality; data volumes can be large, change quickly and be out of date very soon after. 

 The development of the TRE infrastructure by AIMES builds upon the original research work undertaken by the University of Liverpool’s Particle Physics group in three important areas **:** 

-  Research and technical expertise required to build cloud\-based high\-performance computing services. The first AIMES cluster was the MAP2 computer system at Liverpool and facilities were part\-funded by AIMES Grid Services. 

-  Technical expertise required to deploy commercial applications on AIMES’ facilities. Washbrook from Liverpool’s Particle Physics group was employed by AIMES and utilised the MAP2 middleware for the deployment of commercial cloud services. 

-  Data science expertise required to analyse and compute large data sets. This collaboration continued with the input of Liverpool particle physicists who supported the development of hospital episode data analysis and geo\-mapping against population changes.

-  <ins>Delivered i</ins><ins>mprovements</ins> <ins>for NHS cost and resource efficiency</ins> through the use of TREs 

##  4.1 Economic impact of AIMES – increased revenue generation and new job creation 

 Since its foundation based on and underpinned by Liverpool’s particle physics research, AIMES has developed into an award\-winning and industry\-leading commercial data centre service provider based in the Liverpool City Region. Securing £1M Development Funding from Santander in May 2018 allowed AIMES to create a new 10,000 sq. ft. Health Informatics Centre at Kilby House Facility in Liverpool **\[5.1\]**. The new centre provides state\-of\-the art digital accommodation, specifically designed for advanced health informatics with connections to the Kilby House data centre and to the new Health and Social Care Network. 

 The annual turnover of AIMES increased by £2.2M \(96%\) to £4.5M in 2019/20 from £2.3M in 2014/15 **\[5.1\]**, underlining the economic impact of AIMES which was founded on the basis of and underpinned by Liverpool’s research. This is an average year\-on\-year growth of more than 14% **\[5.1\],** significantly exceeding the UK’s national average turnover figures for small UK companies with 10\-49 employees of £3M per annum, as outlined by the UK government’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) in 2019 **\[5.2\]**. Between 2014 and 2020, AIMES created 21 new jobs in the Liverpool City Region, bringing its current headcount up to a total of 30 staff employed **\[5.1\]**. This represents a significant increase of 70% from 2014 to 2020, and demonstrates the growth and viability of AIMES Grid Services’ business. 

##  4.2 Healthcare impact of TREs – improved health service design and commissioning 

 In the healthcare sector, when dataflows cross organisational boundaries, including the NHS, social care, universities, police and industry, there is a need for a trustworthy infrastructure to link data while preserving the needs of the data owners, citizens, and researchers. AIMES Grid Services took on the task of addressing this challenge by using research expertise from the Department of Physics’ MAP2 computer to develop the Trustworthy Research Environment \(TRE\) \- a secure platform to analyse data and satisfy common data standards, information governance and legal requirements for the storage and use of data. 

 In 2016 AIMES Grid Services pioneered the TRE infrastructure in a number of project initiatives in collaboration with industry, the NHS and universities. AIMES’ digital services have had significant impact on improving the design and commissioning of healthcare services in the North of England through the Connected Health Cities programme. Three examples of the impact of TREs on healthcare services \(4.2a, 4.2b, 4.2c\) are described below. 

###  4.2a The Connected Health Cities programme – “ *Healthcare Project of the Year*” 

 AIMES Grid Services was awarded a contract to host the infrastructure for the Connected Health Cities programme to unite regional health data with advanced technology. AIMES used its cloud computing expertise to build two TREs: the North West Coast, and the North East and North Cumbria TREs which enabled local adaptation to governance, data and research requirements **\[5.3\].** The pan\-northern Connected Health Cities programme was named “ *Healthcare Project of the Year*” at the 2018 Bionow Awards **\[5.4\],** recognising Connected Health Cities’ innovative use of TRE technology and NHS data in creating and embedding learning health systems across 20 care pathway projects in the North of England. *“The key element in selecting the winner was that through bringing together a complex number of partners and organisations, the project has been able to harness and make use of clinical data. It is a project of magnitude and truly connects the North.”* \- Technology Director at Trustech **\[5.4\]**. 

###  4.2b Design and commissioning of healthcare services in the North of England 

 AIMES’ deployment of a TRE with the Connected Health Cities programme was pivotal in improving the design and commissioning of healthcare services in the North of England. 

 The Great North Care Record created one shared care record for patients. Using the TRE infrastructure, the Great North Care Record now gives care records access to 100% of General Practices across the North East and North Cumbria, involving 400 practices, 25 NHS and Local Authorities, and 12 NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups, saving at least £8M per year **\[5.3\]**. 

 By running newly developed algorithms on the TRE infrastructure, an extra 66% of epilepsy\-related admissions were identified when compared to just using the primary diagnosis code, capturing more accurate average length of stay **\[5.3\]**. An application of these findings enabled paramedics to access epilepsy care records from secondary care to inform decisions about conveyance and immediate care **\[5.3\]**. “ *By making additional information accessible for our ambulance clinicians, they will be able to make more informed decisions based on the patient’s medical history. This means that if the patient could benefit more from care in the community, unnecessary A&E admissions can be avoided which in turn will free up vital emergency resources.”* \- Chief Consultant Paramedic, North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust **\[5.3\]**. 

###  4.2c Detecting cases of Alcohol\-Related Liver Disease 

 The North West region of England has one of the country’s highest rates of alcohol\-specific deaths and Alcohol\-Related Liver Disease is the dominant cause. Early inpatient intervention has the potential to save lives, however, reports show fewer than half of patients received ‘good care’ and mortality rates are high **\[5.5\]**. Using the TRE infrastructure through the Connected Health Cities programme, an extra 40% of cases of Alcohol\-Related Liver Disease were detected when compared with standard approaches for capturing data on emergency admissions. The detection of extra cases of Alcohol\-Related Liver Disease resulted in improved knowledge of disease burden and better monitoring of inpatient and post\-discharge outcomes **\[5.3\].** “ *Our goal is to link, analyse and visualise data in ways that reflect the complexities of alcohol\-related conditions and the wide variability in local service provision and organisation across the region – bringing local context to the interrogation of data*” \- Consultant Gastroenterologist at Aintree University Hospital, North Mersey HIS and Connected Health Cities Clinical Lead for Alcohol **\[5.6\]**. 

##  4.3 Impact of TREs on NHS practice and operations – improved cost and resource efficiency for health services 

 Current practice in large\-scale, multi\-centre clinical trials are often wasteful, resulting in significant costs and overheads. Trial protocols, staff records, training and governance information are typically maintained by participant sites in paper form which is not efficient practice within NHS operations. Poor recruitment for clinical trials can not only have financial ramifications, owing to increased time and resources being spent, but can also adversely influence the clinical impact of a study if it becomes underpowered **\[5.7\].** 

 In response to this problem, AIMES and the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust partnered to design and build a secure cloud\-based platform, a TRE called “Streamline”, to manage research data capture and document workflows. The benefits of Streamline include: reduced administration costs to keep protocols up to date, increased visibility of the research data for adaptive trial designs, easier data collection for medical professionals, making clinical trials paper\-free and guaranteeing failsafe access to current documents and legacy versions, appropriate access from any web\-enabled device, allowing remote\-view and monitoring of research governance, for cost efficiency and assurance. 

 Streamline enabled a reduction of almost 50% in the time taken to recruit patients into cardiac clinical trial programmes at the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. When first deployed, a three\-year recruitment target was met within 18 months **\[5.1\]**. *“The online trial system is a sea\-change in trial governance. It relieves individual trial staff of the burden of site file management and provides many useful tools to the system administrators”* \- Research IT and Systems Lead at the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust **\[5.7\]**. 

 Having worked together in the deployment and implementation of TREs, the partnership between AIMES Grid Services and the Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust was one of the three finalists for the “ *Best Industry Partnership*” award at the North West Coast Research & Innovation Awards 2017 **\[5.8\]**, recognising the significant impact of their partnership on cost and resource efficiencies in the provision of healthcare services for the NHS.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Despite the ubiquity and universal popularity of the guitar, its myriad disciplines have largely operated in myopic isolation with minimal cultural exchange, shared knowledge and symbiotic collaboration. In contrast and in response, the complementary research of Goss and Mermikides is characterised by a wide stylistic pluralism, a radical redrafting of convention, and a rich diversity of creative and analytical approaches. Through their establishment of the International Guitar Research Centre \(IGRC\) – which now represents a vast and growing proportion of the world’s leading guitarists, researchers, and composers – their vision has transformed the ‘Guitarscape’ \(Dawes, 2016\) both inside and outside the academy, forged new musical practices, integrating previously disparate guitar cultures \(Bennett, 2001\) and through recordings, scores, broadcasts, performances and pedagogy has enabled game\-changing advances to the practice, culture and public engagement of this universal instrument. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Goss and Mermikides are composer\-guitarist\-academics with complementary skill sets and expertise. They both embrace wide unprejudiced stylistic pluralism, interdisciplinarity, practice\-informed research; and a vision in the potential of international collaboration and cultural exchange to develop significantly the repertoire, practice and knowledge of the instrument; and extend its influence beyond its domain. 

 Their underpinning research may be categorised into five interlocking categories. 

 **2.1 Acoustic Resonance**. Goss’s wide knowledge and experience of historical and contemporary guitar practice, and collaboration with many of the world’s leading practitioners have shaped novel contemporary compositional, extended techniques and notational approaches for the guitar. These have greatly expanded the contemporary repertoire for the instrument which are now adopted by practitioner and composers internationally **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6\]**. 

 **2.2 Models of biological rhythm**. Mermikides’s Bloodlines \(2004\) is an ‘auto\-biological’ guitar piece created by the systematic translation of his blood cell populations during his leukaemia treatment. This technology\-assisted approach supplants the Western notation ‘grid’ with a biological continuity. In so doing fundamental principles of rhythmic expression are revealed **\[3.7\]**, as well as extensive opportunities for novel compositional practice **\[3.2\]**. Such models are actively employed by Mermikides as analytical, pedagogical and compositional resources across a wide range of genres. 

 **2.3 The guitar as concerto and chamber music instrument**. Since 2008, Goss has worked with many of the world’s leading orchestras, and through the use of amplification has repositioned the classical guitar as a **concerto** instrument **\[3.3\]**. He has also worked with many of the world’s leading performers developing the role of the guitar in mixed chamber ensembles. This research has greatly expanded the instrument’s limited concerto and ensemble repertoire **\[3.4\]**. 

 **2.4 Models of improvisation**. Initially conceived to analyse and inform jazz guitar improvisation Mermikides’s M\-Space \(multi\-dimensional musical space\) model developed into a supporting mechanism for many improvisational forms, electro\-acoustic composition and performance. This liminalism of musical practice within and beyond nominal stylistic boundaries pervades the ethos of IGRC and its resulting outputs **\[3.5\]**. 

 **2.5 Stylistic and interdisciplinary pluralism**. Mermikides and Goss collectively represent interests, influences and expertise in the music of the Western canon, jazz and popular styles, electronic music, ethnomusicology and collaborate widely within and beyond their respective fields. They have produced outputs with a wide range of musicians, scientists, software developers and institutions including Dame Evelyn Glennie, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicola Benedetti CBE, Brian Eno, Peter Zinovieff, Pat Martino, Mikhail Pletnev, Professor Morten Kringelbach \(Music in the Brain Institute\), Ableton, Royal Society of Medicine, Royal Physiological Society, Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music and the Smithsonian Institute **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7\]**. 

 This underpinning research – through the vehicle of International Guitar Research Centre – forms the supporting mechanisms with which the independent silos of global guitar styles are now being bridged and extended beyond the guitar domain. The impact of which is documented below in the context of new events, presentations, compositions, analytical approaches, collaborations and pedagogical resources otherwise unimaginable in the preceding ‘Guitarscape’. 
","
 **3. References to the research** \(indicative maximum of six references\) 

 Since 2000, Goss has published over 100 compositions for a wide range of orchestral, instrumental vocal forces. His music has been recorded on more than 80 CDs \(EMI, Decca, Telarc, Virgin Classics, Naxos and Deutsche Grammophon\). He is considered ‘one of the guitar’s finest living composers’ \(International Record Review\). Mermikides has had radical new works exhibited in international venues \(including the Smithsonian Institute, Design Museum, Science Museum, TEDx\). His analytical work is published by Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, Soundboard Scholar, Routledge; featured in the Guardian, Times Higher Education and presented in keynote presentations in a range of scientific and artistic disciplines.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact delivered by the underpinning research takes four broad forms: 

 **4.1 New compositions** – performances, recordings, broadcasts, streaming. 

 **4.2 Public facing events** – in partnership with established festivals and symposia. 

 **4.3 Impact via media** – broadsheet newspaper and magazine articles, radio and TV features. 

 **4.4 Pedagogical impact** – through international foundations and educational organisations. 

 The main beneficiary groups are: 

 i\) Public audience \[see **4.1, 4.2, 4.3**\] 

 ii\) Professional and amateur practitioners \(guitarists and composers\) \[see **4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4**\] 

 iii\) Students and teachers \[see **4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4**\] 

 Through the work of the IGRC, the network of contemporary guitar communities is more deeply integrated. It has a broader and richer repertoire, a more highly developed intercultural understanding, and it utilises more interconnected modes of practice. The research undertaken by Goss and Mermikides has changed the way the guitar is played, written for, written about and its impact on wider musical practice. 

####  4.1 New compositions 

 Goss has composed music for many of the world’s most important classical guitarists \(John Williams OBE **\[3.3\]**, David Russell \(2015\), Xuefei Yang **\[3.4\]**, Zoran Dukić **\[3.1\]**. His music has had a significant cultural impact by expanding the repertoire through idiomatic and stylistic innovations **\[2.1, 2.3, 2.5\]**, thereby enriching the audience experience and stimulating performers, composers, audiences, critics, and writers to debate, dialogue, and commentary. Through Goss’s ground\-breaking works for Matthew Wadsworth ‘the theorbo is catapulted into the present, reinventing itself with a range of extended techniques and soloistic effects it never knew it was capable of.’ \(BBC Music Magazine, 4/19\). Goss’s music receives between 500 and 800 professional performances every year. Performances have taken place in most major concert venues of the world: Carnegie Hall, New York \(17/4/19, 6/11/15\); Royal Festival Hall, London \(11/6/14\); Concertgebouw, Amsterdam \(24/9/19\); Tchaikovsky Hall, Moscow \(20/3/17, 27/3/15, 26/9/14\); National Centre for Performing Arts, Beijing \(5/7/14\). The total sales of recordings of his music are in excess of half a million and his music has been streamed over a million times during the impact period. Mermikides’s Bloodlines was broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s Midweek to an estimated audience of 7 million listeners **\[5.8\]**, bringing to a mainstream audience the results and process of his research practice. Several of Mermikides’s works were broadcast on Dame Evelyn Glennie’s Rhythm of Life two\-part series **\[5.6\]** and his sonifications of sleep were featured on BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio 4’s Inside Science **\[5.9\]**. Work with Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber on Stephen Ward \(ITV, Deutsche Grammophon 2013\) brought Goss’s research to a wide mainstream TV audience. In an interview for Soundboard John Williams said ‘I was really knocked out by Steve \[Goss\]’s Guitar Concerto <…> a whole lot of things that I think are quite original. I don’t know of any guitar concerto which is as consistently successful on all fronts.’ **\[5.4\]** 

####  4.2 Public facing events 

 The IGRC has partnered with festivals and arts organisations to co\-host a number of public\-facing events. The Altamira Hong Kong International Guitar Symposium \(2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\), 21<sup>st</sup> Century Guitar \(Canada, 2019 & Portugal, 2020\); Dublin Guitar Symposium \(2019\); London Guitar Festival \(every year since 2014\); Altamira Shenzhen Fuge Guitar Week \(China, 2019\). These events have provided a platform and encouraged performance, compositional activity and culture in a wide range of global guitar styles and artists. **\[2.5\]** 

####  4.3 Impact via public media 

 Goss’s work **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6\]** has been written about in BBC Music Magazine **\[5.1\]** and Gramophone Magazine **\[5.2\]** and has been reviewed in The Independent, The Financial Times \(16/9/2016\), International Record Review, Soundboard, and Classical Music Magazine. Four of Goss’s albums were ‘Editor’s Choice’ in Gramophone Magazine \(3/19, 3/15\). Goss has been a regular guest on BBC Radio 3’s In Tune programme where his music has been featured several times **\[5.3\]** \(9/8/18, 21/10/14, 10/6/14\). He has been interviewed by Soundboard Magazine **\[5.5\]**, Classical Guitar Magazine, and on various podcasts, and radio shows \(for example BBC World Service, ‘World Update’ and ‘The Forum’\). 

 Mermikides has been interviewed and his work **\[2.2, 2.4, 2.5\]** featured in the Guardian, BBC Radio 4 Midweek **\[5.8\]**, by Evelyn Glennie on BBC Radio 4 **\[5.9\]** and on BBC Inside Science, where his M\-Space mapping of sleep cadences was described as ‘not just radio friendly and eminently listenable, but I think also a great tool for diagnosis’ by Oxford Professor of neuroscience Professor Morten Kringelbach **\[5.9\]**. This work was also brought to public attention in the *Designing Time* exhibition in the Design Museum London, a residency at the Frank Mohr Institute and the Everything We Do is Music TEDx presentation **\[5.10\]** – TEDx talks channel \(27.6M subscribers\). At the end of the talk, it was revealed that the audience had unwittingly created a new piece of music generated by the mapping of their choice of seats to a virtual fretboard. 

####  4.4 Pedagogical impact 

 The underpinning research at the IGRC has had a significant impact on the teaching of the guitar. Through the IGRC’s partnership with the Guitar Foundation of America \(GFA\), Goss and Mermikides are involved in the GFA’s pedagogical and mentoring programmes. Goss has made several films for the California\-based educational platform – Tonebase – which explored the pedagogical implications of the latest innovations in guitar technique developed at the IGRC. Goss’s teaching at festivals, and through residencies, has impacted guitarists of all levels, particularly teachers who use Goss’s research as part of their daily work. Due to their cutting\-edge technical demands **\[2.1\]** and amalgamation of several contrasting guitar styles **\[2.5\]**, Goss’s compositions have featured on examination syllabuses and in final recitals at many of the major music schools throughout the world, for example: The Julliard School, Yale University, Central Beijing Conservatory, Royal Academy of Music \(London\). They have been set as test pieces in all the major international guitar competitions, including: GFA \(2016\), Pittaluga \(2019\), London \(2014\), and Changsha \(2020\) International Guitar Competitions. 

 Mermikides’s rhythmic and improvisational research **\[2.2, 2.5\]** is used actively as a supporting mechanism to pedagogical practice in the general guitar playing community. This includes the Breaking 4/4 Workshop as part of Ableton’s Educational Tour and the first known in\-depth and evidence\-based pedagogical material in a major mainstream guitar magazine Art of Timing in Guitar Techniques Magazine where a reader described it as ‘tantamount to being an encyclopaedia on timing, feeling and groove, and something perhaps we should all keep close for reference.’ **\[5.7\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The practise\-based research of artist Max Eastley was among the first to extensively investigate and model Aeolian devices – sound installations powered by atmospheric phenomena such as the wind – in the context of sound art. The research took place during an AHRC Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Arts at Oxford Brookes University’s Sonic Art Research Unit \(SARU\). The impact of Eastley’s research is demonstrated most clearly through the touring event *Audible Forces* \(2013–2014\) *,* a landscape of Aeolian sound installations produced by SARU and Oxford Contemporary Music \(OCM\). *Audible Forces* has had a transformative impact on the participating artists’ creative practice and career development, enabled organisational development for key production partners, and brought a legacy of sound art installations to appreciative new audiences in the UK and internationally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Internationally renowned sound artist Max Eastley, whose career has spanned five decades, was one of first to develop an artistic practice on the border between sound in the natural environment and human intervention in that environment, using the driving forces of electricity, wind, water and ice. 

 The underpinning research for this case study took place during an Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Arts hosted by SARU 2010–2013. The research project, entitled *Aeolian Sound: An investigation of Aeolian Phenomena and their incorporation into Sonic Culture*, focussed specifically on Aeolian phenomenon – the activation of sound through the action of the wind on natural materials. \( **R1, R2\)** The principal mode of investigation was to seek out materials that are activated by natural forces and test them in a variety of formations. Eastley used the annual SARU festival of sound art and experimental composition, audiograft, as a laboratory for the development of these Aeolian practices, experimenting with formations of latex \(2011, Fig.1 below, **R3a**\), and copper \(2013, Fig.2 below, **R3b**\), alongside a range of other materials including brass, aluminium and wound steel wires. 





  

 Fig. 1 \(left\): *Aeolian Device \(Latex\)*, audiograft 2012, Oxford 

 Fig. 2 \(right\): *Aeolian Device \(Copper\)*, audiograft 2013, Oxford 

 Further practical explorations of Aeolian phenomena led Eastley to develop: an innovative indoor work for Raven Row Art Gallery, London in 2011; Aeolian harps at Tempelhof Airport, Berlin \(Berlin Sonic Places in 2012; and outdoor Aeolian devices at The Water Tower, Wasserturm, in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin\) in 2013. These works tested two key aspects of the research – the broadcast of Aeolian phenomena into indoor spaces and the use of arrays of Aeolian harps. 

 In *Gone with the Wind*, Eastley built an Aeolian installation on the roof of Raven Row Gallery and worked with engineer Dave Hunt to develop a means by which the sounds produced by the wind on the Aeolian device could be transmitted twelve meters down into the interior. This allowed visitors to experience and explore the relationship between the 18<sup>th</sup> century architecture and history of the Aeolian harp. **\(R3c\)** 

 The investigation of Aeolian Harps and devices became central to Eastley’s practice. For example, twelve Aeolian Harps, constructed on site, were installed for one day on the roof of a decommissioned meteorology building at Tempelhof Airport. The installation and an accompanying talk were part of a series of events curated by German Academic Exchange Service \(DAAD\) awardee – sound artist Peter Cusack. Eastley's contribution was part of the examination of how urban acoustic phenomena could be exploited for city planning and his role was to make imaginative suggestions as to how wind\-energised sound might be used to enhance future soundscapes. **\(R3d\)** In another work, eight Aeolian Harps were erected on the top of the external faces of the Water Tower \(Wasserturm\) in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin. The sound from these was transmitted and projected into the interior of the building, in which Eastley had installed ten acoustic sculptures. The sounds of the Aeolian harps and the acoustic sculptures were combined to create an aural space that led visitors through the physical architecture, discovering the interior sculptures on the journey. **\(R3e\)** 

 Max Eastley's Aeolian sound explorations, as part of his AHRC Fellowship, led to the creation of *Audible Forces*, a touring exhibition produced by SARU and OCM and co\-commissioned by Brighton Festival and the Without Walls consortium of festivals and organisations dedicated to raising the profile of the UK outdoor arts sector. This was an outdoor exhibition of work by seven artists who all created new Aeolian works using the wind to produce sound. The exhibition toured for two years \(2013–2014\) and went to: Brighton Festival, Norfolk and Norwich Festival, Salisbury International Arts Festival, Greenwich and Docklands International Festival, Stockton International Riverside Festival, Kendal Lakes Alive, Quays Open Day \(Greater Manchester’s Waterfront\), Salford and Stoke\-on\-Trent. *Audible Forces* energised creative activity around Aeolian phenomena in the UK and opened the door for this practice into the mainstream of sound art. \( **R4\)** The research is archived and documented at  [www.maxeastley.co.uk](http://www.maxeastley.co.uk/). **\(R5\)**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 With production support from SARU and Oxford Contemporary Music \(OCM\), Eastley’s research into Aeolian phenomena led to the creation of *Audible Forces*, an ambitious outdoor touring show, featuring commissioned Aeolian sound art works from seven artists: Kathy Hinde \( *Sonic Reed Beds*; *Aeolian Soundmap* with Ed Holroyd\), Mike Blow \( *Arpeggi*\), Jony Easterby \( *Birdhouse Flock* and *Stress and stone*\), Nathaniel Mann \( *Pigeon Whistles* with Peter Petravicius\), Mark Anderson \( *Phantom Field*\), Dan Fox \( *Howling Wire*\) and Max Eastley \( *Aeolian Harp* and *Aeolian Percussion*\). *Audible Forces* was transformative for the artists and arts organisations involved, and has been a catalyst for a legacy of new art works, which continue to entertain and inspire audiences around the world. 

###  Inspiring and enabling artists to develop their practice and create new sound art 

 The artists engaged with *Audible Forces* benefited from the experience in many ways including: introduction to new networks enabling the co\-production of original sound art works; the development of novel practices requiring technical innovation; a new understanding of the potential of the field; and the development of new modes of thinking and new creative partnerships that have led to further commissions. 

 Mike Blow **\(S1a\)** states that ‘ *the experience of participating in Audible Forces was instrumental in developing my creative practice and building my professional profile, as well as enabling several key collaborations that have built a legacy of new art works, some of which have shown internationally*’. The commission for *Audible Forces* was a significant moment in the development of technical skills that Blow would use in future projects: ‘ *Audible Forces was the first time I had the platform to make a large, portable, robust artwork ... the first time I toured with an installation and the first time I had been involved in the UK festival scene, so it was a big learning and networking opportunity*.’ He expands on the networking opportunities that the commission afforded him: ‘ *Audible Forces ...undoubtedly raised my profile ... It introduced me to arts producers, festivals and promoters, and taught me a lot about working with other artists. The experience prompted me to get a studio in Plymouth, and helped me integrate into the art scene in the South West*.’ 

 Of the collaborative projects that the *Audible Forces* commission led to, Mike Blow’s further work with Ed Harcourt is perhaps the most productive example. It led to the creation of his work *Colony* \(together with Alison Ballard\), a multi\-channel touch and sound installation, consisting of up to seven internally lit, air filled spheres ranging in size from  2–3.5 meters, that emit an otherworldly 20\-minute sonic composition. These large tactile, sonic sculptures allows the audience to experience the physicality of sound through listening, touching, and hugging. *Colony* has toured in the UK since 2016. A precursor to *Colony* was *Pod* **\(S7\)**, a tactile sound sculpture which featured in Science Museum London's Wonderlab Gallery from 2016 until 2020. The relationship developed with Ed Harcourt as a result of *Audible Forces* was fundamental to these projects. **\(S1a\)** 

 Involvement in *Audible Forces* ‘had a huge impact’ on the creative practice and professional profile of Nathaniel Mann **\(S1b\)** who states that: ‘ *The successful trajectory of my subsequent career can in many ways be traced back to my involvement*.’ It was ‘ *the first time I had toured with an installation. It gave me huge exposure to new audiences – It honed my skills in being able to present to, and directly interact with, audiences*.’ His work *Pigeon Whistles* **\(S7\)** has been described by an audience member as ‘ *the closest thing to heaven that I have experienced*’ \(the Guardian 22/08/2014\). Mann went on to curate a temporary exhibit on pigeon whistles at Oxford University’s Pitt River Museum, which has been accessioned in the permanent collection of the museum. This was the first time he had curated a display: ‘ *The exhibit foregrounded those artefacts that were previously rarely noticed; introducing new audiences to ancient Chinese and Vietnamese listening practices and contextualising my own work with the museum collections.*’ In 2017, BBC Radio 4 commissioned a documentary about *Pigeon Whistles*, which featured on  [<ins>Radio 4</ins> ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08ynyk5)\(Pick of the week; July and September 2017\), which Mann presented. He has subsequently written and presented six BBC Radio documentaries, all of which were selected as BBC Radio 4 Picks of the Week. Pigeon Whistles was awarded the George Butterworth Prize for Composition 2014 and in 2019 Mann was recipient of the prestigious  [<ins>Paul</ins> <ins>Hamyln</ins> <ins>Foundation prize</ins>](https://www.phf.org.uk/our-work-in-the-uk/ideas/awards-for-artists/), a success which he attributes to the work that he did with *Audible Forces* and his Pitt Rivers residency. **\(S1b\)** 

 Award winning Sound Artist Kathy Hinde \(Ivor Novello Award for Sound Art 2020\) states that: ‘ *the research into aeolian instruments and possibilities has continued in my practice ever since… I have learnt a huge amount from the wealth of experience of the other Audible Forces artists, and we have all continued to work together in a variety of capacities... Audible Forces helped me expand areas of my practice more confidently into the outdoor arts realm… I learnt loads of practical know\-how, and took much inspiration from the wealth of work \[the other artists had made\]*.’ **\(S1c\)** 

 The underpinning research had a significant impact on Eastley’s own arts practice, particularly with regard to projects developed with German artist and producer Carsten Seifferth. Seiffarth explains that Eastley’s reputation, and the success of a previous project together, led, in 2014, to Eastley being the first British person appointed City Artist in Bonn, a role in which he created artistic connections with spaces in the city. This included the technically challenging design and installation of Aeolian harps mounted on two rafts floating on a lake in the Bonn Botanic Gardens \(Aeolian Islands\). **\(S7\)** The installations were enjoyed by visitors who came specifically to see them, and those who discovered them on their visit. In 2016, building on this, he developed *Windklänge* \(Wind Sounds\) at Herren Hausen Grosser Garten, Hannover, which used the floating harps on the canal of an 18th century formal garden. **\(S7\)** Seiffarth summarises: ‘ *Max's work has brought unique, inspiring experiences to many venues and new audiences in several cities in Germany. Max's extensive research into aeolian phenomena is impressive and enabled him to create beautiful new sound installations, which are unlike other things previously seen and heard in Germany.*’ **\(S2\)** 

###  Enabling Arts Organisations to develop new ways of producing shows and supporting emerging artists 

 For ACE funded Arts Organisation OCM, co\-producing *Audible Forces* led directly to changes in the way the organisation approaches production of shows and a new way of working with artists to develop public\-facing projects. *Audible Forces* was OCM’s first multi\-artist show for some time and taking a show of this size on tour was a significant undertaking. As OCM’s Deputy Director stated: ‘ *Because of the scale, the whole staff was involved in producing, not just the Director, which was a new approach for OCM and great for up\-skilling our colleagues. After the tour, the organisation restructured to share the producing work across more of the staff, partly as a result of the experience staff gained from this project.*’ Further, ‘ *the show and tour has been used to demonstrate to funders what OCM is able to achieve in terms of producing work, nurturing artists, and reaching and inspiring large audiences through our creative producing in partnership with organisations like Brookes/SARU.*’ **\(S3\)** 

 One key legacy of this was BOOM **\(S3\)**, the annual professional development scheme for musicians, sound practitioners and producers created by OCM: ‘ *We had seen how valuable the skill sharing and relationship building had been between artists during the Audible Forces tour. This had only been possible because they'd been given the opportunity to spend plenty of time together and it happened organically in the time they had off when they were on tour. We shaped the scheme so that we can recreate this valuable organic process for the participants.*’ **\(S4\)** BOOM residencies with OCM enable practitioners and producers \(c.20 so far\) to lead their own development, research or training programme over one year with no expectation of specific outcomes beyond the evidence of real and effective learning in their practice and profession. BOOM artists have included *Audible Forces* participants Mike Blow and Kathy Hinde, who used their residencies to create unique artworks. For example, Blow experienced how BOOM ‘ *provided the funding and space*’ to develop the *Hornet*, a synthesizer with gestural control, which has gone on to sell c.40 pieces internationally. **\(S1a, S7\)** 

###  Reaching new audiences and introducing them to unique, formative experiences 

 *Audible Forces*, with its dynamic concept and accessible locations, attracted new audiences across the UK, transforming their understanding of familiar places. One visitor noted: ‘ *We absolutely loved the installation – It felt as though it should always be there, a natural extension of how we experience the sea. We often walk along the promenade and it made that walk all the more ‘real’ and opened up our senses.*’ The event created an appetite for further engagement with many visitors visiting multiple times: ‘ *Enjoyed the event a lot – came down on 2 consecutive days to see if the weather altered the ‘performances*’. 

 The show inspired audiences of all ages including children: ‘ *We were fortunate enough to have timed our visit to coincide with the whistling pigeons. It was fantastic and my children \(12 & 9\) were really entranced also. My pre\-teen thinks everything is “boring” unless it has a screen attached to it but he really enjoyed this event.*’ A primary school teacher responded: ‘ *I thought it was really interesting as a way to look at how we generate sound and how \(like with wind/solar energy\) we can utilise the natural resources to create sound.  I took videos to show children in my school.  I loved the kinaesthetic layout of the exhibits*’. **\(S5\)** 

 Further, the show also promoted an awareness of the natural environment: ‘ *Some beautifully different pieces that awakened your own awareness to the weather and forces around us. Something that does need to occur every now and then to remind us of the scale and power of the environment we’re immersed in*’. 

 A subsequent installation by Eastley, Aeolian Harp and Sculptures for Perrott’s Folly **\(S7\)** produced by the Ikon Gallery, attracted 683 visitors from 10 May to 10 June 2018. One visitor summed up the response of many: ‘ *Thought\-provoking and totally immersive. The harps provide glorious sensory overload.*’ The Ikon Gallery’s Director confirmed. ‘ *The aeolian installation with Max was a great success, characteristically unpretentious, imaginative and inventive. It was engaging as it appealed to visitors’ sense of wonder.*’ **\(S6\)**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Many products such as cosmetics and toiletries are manufactured in non\-sterile environments where microbial contamination can occur. Contamination can pose a serious health risk to consumers and lead to costly product recalls. A research programme between Cardiff University and global manufacturer, Unilever PLC, defined the risks of contamination by *Burkholderia* bacteria and other priority contaminants for the company. Based on Cardiff’s data, Unilever accurately identified contaminants, developed new preservative compositions, and implemented robust monitoring and risk prevention strategies. This successfully reduced bacterial contaminations for the company and prevented product recalls, each of which cost at least £750K \(and often millions when brand and manufacturer confidence is compromised\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The *Burkholderia cepacia* complex \( *Burkholderia*\) encompasses a group of over 20 bacterial species, requiring specialist molecular approaches to accurately identify each strain. They are also highly antimicrobial\-resistant bacteria, making them hard to treat in human infections. This resistance also makes them problematic contaminants as they are difficult to suppress through antimicrobial preservatives used in non\-sterile industrial products. Unilever knew that unidentified *Burkholderia* species were a contamination risk and wished to understand if this risk could be eradicated, even though this is not required under global manufacturing regulations. 

 Cardiff University’s team was in a unique position to work with Unilever on this issue as Mahenthiralingam had been the first to develop a single\-gene approach to identification of *Burkholderia* in the early 2000s *.* This was subsequently developed by Mahenthiralingam into a multi\-gene identification approach, multilocus sequence typing \(MLST\), enabling *Burkholderia* strains to be accurately identified and tracked on a global scale **\[3.1\]**. In the last five years, the group has also pioneered genome sequencing methods for high resolution tracking and risk analysis of *Burkholderia* bacteria. This unique expertise and MLST resource led Unilever to approach the Cardiff team and begin a joint research programme in 2004 totalling over £1M in award funding **\[G3.1 \- G3.5\]**. This programme has provided pioneering data on bacterial contamination in non\-sterile industrial products as follows: 

 **2.1 Unilever asked the Cardiff team to accurately identify **Burkholderia** bacteria and understand contamination risk** 

 The Cardiff team characterised bacterial strains from Unilever manufacturing incidents **\[G3.1, G3.2\]** and showed that: 

-  *Burkholderia* strains recovered from industrial products may be genetically identical to those encountered in clinical infections **\[3.2\]**, and thus have the genetic capacity to cause infections as a major risk factor. 

-  Multiple species of *Burkholderia* can cause industrial contamination **\[3.3\]**. 

-  Species and strains of *Burkholderia*, which pose a risk to vulnerable individuals, were encountered as contaminants at Unilever sites. For example, *Burkholderia cenocepacia* was the second most common species found in industrial contamination **\[3.3\]** and is also a species associated with global epidemics and rapid death in people with cystic fibrosis. 

-  Pumping preservatives out of cells \(efflux\) provided a key mechanism used by *Burkholderia* to survive within industrial products **\[3.3\]**. 

-  Accurate identification of the *Burkholderia* species and strain type were key to understanding the risks of infection associated with contamination. 

-  Testing the susceptibility and tolerance to preservatives of certain *Burkholderia* strains **\[3.3\]** could inform product preservation strategies to minimise repeat contamination. 

 **2.2 Unilever subsequently asked Cardiff researchers to identify other priority contaminants and develop a single comprehensive genomic database of problematic bacterial strains** 

 In 2011, Unilever commissioned the Cardiff team to investigate an additional priority contaminant, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* \( *P. aeruginosa*\) **\[G3.3, G3.4, G3.5\]**. Findings from this research revealed that: 

-  Unilever’s system for growing cultures to test products for *P. aeruginosa* was robust, enabling Unilever to maintain their standard protocols rather than upgrade to more expensive methods **\[3.4\]**. 

-  *P. aeruginosa* contamination strains had larger genomes than strains from other sources, and high\-risk industrial strains could be rapidly identified by the presence of a large and unique plasmid biomarker **\[3.5\]**. 

 The research also identified that antimicrobial resistant *Enterobacteriaceae* are key contaminants of future concern for Unilever, resulting in the funding of a new program to characterise risk and prevention strategies to eliminate contamination by these bacteria **\[G3.6\]**. 

 The Cardiff team further showed that, between 2005 and 2018, 49% of microbial contaminants reported to the European Commission non\-sterile food product recall database \(Safety Gate\) had been classified as unidentified **\[3.6\]**. Cardiff’s genomic approach, however, provided Unilever with a single database of 269 new genome sequences of all their contamination incident bacteria \(including *Pseudomonas*, *Burkholderia*, *Enterobacteriaceae* and other priority industrial strains\), which enabled accurate identification and risk understanding. This database, and the joint research programme, were fundamental in informing Unilever’s global strategy to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination in their manufacturing processes and maintain their leading position as a global manufacturer of non\-sterile products \(see Section 4\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The outcomes from Cardiff and Unilever’s joint research programme minimised the risk of bacterial contamination within Unilever’s manufacturing processes on a global scale. Unilever’s Beauty and Personal Homecare business has an annual turnover of €37.2BN, with consumers across the globe using their products **\[5.1\]**. The research resulted in safer products for consumers and substantial financial savings for the company. Impact was delivered as follows: 

 **4.1 Providing accurate identification of bacteria contaminants and reducing costly contamination incidents** 

 Unilever used Cardiff’s research to set industry\-leading standards in accurately identifying contaminants and managing the associated risks. The standards adopted by Unilever were considerably more robust than deemed necessary by regulatory compliance, since industry guidelines and European regulations do not require manufacturers to identify *Burkholderia* bacterial contaminations. As noted by Unilever’s Peter Carew \(R&D Director\) and Stuart Campbell\-Lee \(Research Scientist\) **\[5.1, 5.2\]**: 

-  *“Cardiff University researchers have assisted us in the development of a comprehensive database of 269 contaminant strain genomes, including 68* Burkholderia *”* **\[5.2\]**. This represents approximately a **17\-fold increase** in Unilever’s identified contaminant strains since 2016. 

-  *“The new methodology and accompanying genomic knowledge of microbial contaminant strains goes above and beyond regulatory requirements for preservation evaluation to ensure protection against* Burkholderia” **\[5.2\]**. 

 The research has been used by Unilever to: 

-  identify two *Burkholderia* contamination incidents in 2014 \(a cosmetic product\) and 2016 \(a non\-cosmetic product\), which Unilever’s commercial contract research provider \(CRO\) for microbial contamination was unable to identify **\[5.1\]**. The Cardiff team provided Unilever with accurate identification of these *Burkholderia* contaminants using MLST, genome sequencing, and resources not available to the CRO. Informed by Cardiff’s expertise and high\-resolution analysis, Unilever was able to address these incidents with targeted clean\-up procedures **\[5.1\]**; 

-  implement robust strategies to combat bacterial contamination, based on Cardiff\-derived data.  Carew noted that: “ *Since 2014 Unilever cosmetics have not endured a Burkholderia microbial contamination incident as a result of the actions taken from knowledge development achieved through this partnership, specifically improving factory hygiene practices and preservation system design”* **\[5.1\]**. This has prevented contamination and future product recalls. These normally cost in excess of £750K per contamination incident, as well as *“intangibles such as loss of future customer sales due to bad PR”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2 Informing the development and patenting of new preservative compositions** 

 Manufacturers face new challenges as consumer and regulatory demands move towards products with milder, more natural preservatives or preservative\-free formulations. These are, however, at greater risk of microbial contamination **\[5.1\]**. Cardiff research provided Unilever with an understanding of antimicrobial susceptibility and synergy testing methods \(a chequerboard assay\) which led to the company developing and patenting three new preservative compositions for their products \(2019 international patents: WO 2019/233753 A1, WO 2019/233757 A1, and WO 2019/233752 A1\) **\[5.2\]**. These preservative compositions are designed to guard against contamination \(based on Cardiff research **\[3.3, 3.5\]**\), and will be used in a wide range of Unilever’s personal care and hair care products, with a global market value of over US$10BN. As Unilever stated **\[5.2\]**: 

-  *“A method transfer was performed introducing synergy assessments using a ‘chequerboard assay’ for preservatives during Dr Laura Rushton’s \(Cardiff University\) Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) project*.” 

-  *“This methodology and the panels of well characterised, genetically typed contamination strains have since become part of a valuable method to Unilever in order to establish synergistic preservative combinations as part of intellectual property filings impacting at an international level in 2019.”* 

-  *“The use of these proprietary preservative combinations in a range of Unilever consumer products will ensure business continuity is maintained in this multi\-billion Euro business sector.”* 

 **4.3 Informing risk prevention and Unilever’s global research priorities** 

 From April 2016, Unilever developed an internal research strategy entitled ‘Genomic Preservation Science’ from April 2016 **\[5.2\]**. Prior to Cardiff’s research, Unilever was using conventional bacterial assays to identify bacteria, rather than advanced genomic techniques. This new strategy outlined Unilever’s commitment to move away from conventional assays to adopt a robust genomic approach, aligned to benefits demonstrated by Cardiff research **\[3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 3.6\]**. 

 This strategy resulted in a closed industry\-academia workshop to define Unilever’s long\-term capability roadmap \(held in April 2017\). The Cardiff team acted as academic consultants for Unilever, informing development of their strategy and advising on the invited academic delegate list, which included research leaders from Liverpool, Southampton and Cardiff Universities **\[5.3\]**. Unilever’s genomic strategy for identifying, monitoring and eradicating potentially harmful bacteria has now been rolled out across Unilever’s major research and development centres, within the UK, the United States, China and India **\[5.2\]**. 

 Cardiff’s research enabled Unilever to: accurately identify contaminants and essentially stop *Burkholderia* contamination incidents occurring in their products; develop new preservative compositions to avoid bacterial incidents; and implement robust monitoring and a global genomic preservation research strategy designed to avoid costly product recalls. Campbell\-Lee noted that the research has *“empowered the preservation team”* and is driving “ *industry to a more prudent destination to ensure cosmetic and household goods are adequately preserved”* **\[5.2\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Pierre Failler is the leading exponent of ‘Blue Governance’ \(BG\), an approach to managing aquatic ecosystems that combines and expands upon Blue Growth \(BGr\) and Blue Economy \(BE\) strategies. It places ecosystems and their governance at the forefront of decision\-making, positioning them as the central component of sustainable economic policies that pertain to marine environments and resources. Failler’s research and engagement with stakeholders is significant as it has led to **the improved design \[and ongoing\] implementation of more sustainable ocean management policies** at both international and national level: 

 **At the international level**, Failler’s vision of BG has gone beyond shaping global policy discourses on how ecosystems are valued and their contribution to human wellbeing, to the more practical issue of designing regional BE strategies and toolkits. This is most evident in the African case, where his recommendations have been incorporated into the regional strategies of the African Union \(54 countries\) \( **Impact 1**\) **. At the national level**, Failler’s research has led to the design of localised BG strategies that are now being implemented in various countries, including the Bahamas \(Americas\), Bangladesh \(Asia\), and the Seychelles \(Africa\) \( **Impact 2**\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Failler has been providing expert advice to such stakeholders since his appointment at Portsmouth in 1997**. In 2005 he led a EUR4,100,000 EU\-INCO project \(ECOST, 2005\-2010\) bringing together 23 partners spanning Asia, Africa, the South Pacific, Europe and the Caribbean to evaluate the societal costs of fishing practices and fishery policies \( **G1**\). The 102 peer\-reviewed journal outputs and the associated reports and briefing papers that resulted subsequently informed fishing policy across the globe, even attracting favourable comment in the New York Times \(14/1/2008\). Failler subsequently led or was a key participant in projects funded by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(fisher migration in West Africa, 2009\), World Wildlife Fund \(fisheries policy and fisher poverty in West Africa, 2012\), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\-France \(coral reef evaluation in the Caribbean\) and the EU \(Assistance Mechanism for the Atlantic Action Plan, 2014\). In the latter project, one of the key tasks was to ensure the Plan’s objectives were fully coherent with the EU’s “Blue Growth” \(BGr\) initiative. This led Failler to speculate whether an objective \(growth\) was indeed realisable if underlying governance systems relating to that objective are ignored – and hence the notion of ‘blue governance’ \(BG\) came to increasingly dominate his thinking. 

 **The question of how aquatic ecosystems are valued is central to BG research.** However, Failler argues that merely valuing ecosystems is insufficient as while economic valuation “can contribute to improving decisions, helping ensure that environmental concerns are taken fully into account, \[it is\] not a replacement for deliberation, but rather part of it” \( **R1**, p.371\). Instead, the multi\-disciplinary BG approach he has developed proposes that structures and processes are designed to ensure accountability, transparency, responsiveness, rule of law, stability, equity and inclusiveness, empowerment, and broad\-based participation. 

 **Failler’s growing stature in the fisheries field saw him invited in late 2014 to work with the UN Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services \(IPBES**\) in the development of its first public product \- its Conceptual Framework \(2015\). Failler’s role was to offer expert insight and practical examples of how ‘institutions and governance systems determine, to various degrees, the access to, and the control, allocation and distribution of components of nature and anthropogenic assets and their benefits to people’ \( **R2**, p.6\). This allowed him to expand upon the central tenets of the BG approach – namely, how governance systems can be mobilized to ‘foster the recovery of many depleted marine ecosystems \(nature\), fisheries \(nature’s benefits to people\) and their associated food security and lifestyles \(good quality of life\)’ \( **R2**, p8\). It is from this underpinning research that the unique approach of BG emerged. **He was subsequently appointed as a lead author for the IPBES regional report on **Biodiversity and Eco\-Services for Africa**,** taking the role of joint coordinating lead author \(with Kasisi\) on *Chapter 2: Nature’s Contributions to People \(NCP\) and the Quality of Life.* The chapter, which drew extensively upon his previous research \(seven of his published articles are cited\), emphasized the need to elevate and operationalize the contribution of indigenous and local knowledge \( **R3**, p.70\). It also delineated how NCP is critically, and crucially, mediated through governance systems, irrespective of whether these contributions take a material \(i.e.: fish as a protein source\), non\-material \(i.e.: recreational and spiritual fulfilment\), or regulating \(i.e.: marine protected areas\) form \( **R3**, p.81\). These ideas fed into the co\-authored 2018 Science publication where NCP is identified as ‘one of the more recent key elements in the IPBES conceptual framework’, and which ‘elevates, emphasizes, and operationalises the role of indigenous and local knowledge in understanding NCP’ \( **R4**, p.270\). **Inevitably, the holistic nature of the BG approach and the specificity of indigenous/local knowledge and governance systems means policy solutions must be devised – and applied \- in a case\-specific manner.** 

 **The growing recognition of the potential of the BG approach and the NCP conceptual framework for policy\-making has resulted in Failler being commissioned as both project lead and/or lead author on a growing number of projects and regional/national policy and strategy papers.** These include the Africa Blue Economy Strategy \( **R5**\), and the recent UN\-Environment Project on defining a Blue Economy Approach and Guidelines \( **G2**\). He has also worked with the World Bank on synthesizing the BG and Blue Economy approaches to aquatic development, a collaboration that spawned a publication in a peer reviewed journal on the policy options for delivering the Blue Economy in Bangladesh \( **R6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Failler’s research has had a strong and long\-term impact upon public policy at both the international and national level. These policies, in turn, are leading to the improved design of environmental policy in the aquatic field across a growing number of \(implementing\) countries.** 

 **Impact 1: Changing International Policy** 

 **Africa is a significant testing ground for BG policies.** Three of its large marine ecosystems \(LMEs\) rank within the first four most productive LMEs in the world. If all catches in African waters were landed in Africa, the sector could contribute a landed value of USD20 billion to national economies, with an additional USD3.6 billion injected by the small\-scale fishing sectors across the value chain. This represents 1.26% of the GDP of all African countries \(and up to 35% for some of the small island states\). Not surprisingly, the fisheries of Africa provide a source of livelihood for 8,000,000 active fishers and their families, with the Food and Agriculture Organisation \(FAO\) estimating as many as 6,000,000 of these could be in poverty \( **R3**\). 

 Failler was appointed as the joint co\-ordinating lead author \(overseeing the research of 14 national experts\) for the IPBES African regional assessment chapter on ‘NCP and Quality of Life’ in April 2015. His specific contributions were to; \(i\) identify the mix of governance options, policies and management practices that are currently available to reduce the loss of aquatic biodiversity and of NCP in that region, and \(ii\) provide a series of take\-home messages for revitalising international policy development on the theme. His influence was strongly evident in the second of the two exhortations *The Future we Want – Making it Happen Together* in the final report, highlighting to policy\-makers that “Governance options that harness synergies and deliver multiple benefits, supported by an enabling environment, **can help** to balance patterns of access and allocation of ecosystem services in Africa. Policy coherence **may also contribute towards poverty reduction and help to build resilience**.” \(the emphasis is ours\) \( **S1**, p. 15\). 

 It also led the African Union to take action following at the Nairobi Sustainable Blue Economy Conference of November 2018. African leaders at the Conference directed the African Union to work with “relevant stakeholders to develop a blueprint of Africa’s Blue Economy Strategy \(ABES\) that will guide sustainable development and utilization of resources of the Oceans, Seas, Lakes and Rivers for blue economy growth and livelihoods” \( **R5**, p. ix\). Failler was appointed in June 2019 as one of six experts, and his imprint is clearly evident in the final February 2020 document \( **S2**\). **Central to the Strategy was the creation of a BG Office reporting directly into the higher echelons of the AU decision\-making hierarchy**. Its mission is to ensure policy coherence, not only in the realms relating to the management of biological resources \(i.e.: fisheries\), non\-biological resources \(i.e.: oil and energy\) and ocean governance, but also ensuring BG policy aligns with the longer\-term objectives of the African Union Agenda 2063, Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy 2050, the UN Agenda 2030 \(SDGs\), and the 2016 Lomé Charter on Maritime Security and Safety. According to Dr. Mohamed Seisay at the Inter\-African Bureau for Animal Resources, the BG policy framework under the leadership of Failler is *‘likely to be a real game\-changer in terms of not only more effectively measuring nature’s contribution to people at the international level, but also in providing ever more effective pathways out of poverty for many African fishers and their families’* \( **S3**\). 

 ABES is accompanied by an 89 point Blue Economy Implementation Plan 2021\-2025, **with BG being the ‘overarching thematic area’** \( **S4**, p.3\). The Plan pledged to implement a specialist BG toolkit combining BE natural capital accounting, marine and freshwater spatial planning, BE Standards \(to ensure the sustainability of production, trade and consumption of BE goods and services\) and innovative ‘blue’ funding mechanisms \(such as the ‘blue bonds’ issued by the Seychelles\) along the lines advocated by Failler across the region \( **R5**\). These tools and techniques were developed under the UNECA *Blue Economy and Natural Capital Accounting Systems Programme*, trialled in Djibouti, Rwanda and the Seychelles, and endorsed by UNECA in December 2020 \( **S5**\). As UNECA states *: ‘The BE Valuation Toolkit and Operational Manual are superlative additions to the armoury of analytic techniques we have available for implementing environmental policy across the African aquatic arena. Failler’s role in helping us develop the toolkit in accord with BG principles is worthy of the highest praise.’* \( **S6**\). 

 **Impact 2: Changing National Strategy** 

 The integration of the concept of BG and its principles into the governance of oceanic ecosystems is, moreover, growing at the national level across the globe. To cite just three examples drawn from three distinct developing regions: 

1.  **Bangladesh \(2016\-\):** 

 The expansion of Bangladesh’s territorial waters by more than 30% in 2014 following the resolution of territorial differences with Myanmar offered the country unprecedented development opportunities in sectors such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, trade and energy. The challenge, as noted in \( **R6**\), was how to take such opportunities and develop smart and sustainable strategies to maximise them – given more than 30,000,000 Bangladeshis are dependent upon the ocean economy. Failler was invited \(September 2016\) to work as part of a World Bank/EU team with the Bangladeshi government on a BE strategy and policy that would unlock these opportunities and thus realise the nation’s blue economy aspirations. 

 In parallel he was contracted by the Bangladeshi Ministry of Foreign Affairs \(MOFA\) to work more explicitly on the more immediate policy solutions required in terms of the countries extended marine space pending the approval and subsequent implementation of the comprehensive WB/EU BE strategy \(published as *Toward a Blue Economy: A Pathway for Sustainable Growth in Bangladesh*, 2018\). The MOFA policy paper \(2018\) lamented that current institutional arrangements in the country were based on a sector by sector management approach, which was insufficient for sustainable ocean governance. Instead a BG\-centric approach was recommended with the prime task of the establishment of a coordination unit across the different government ministries that had previously been working in isolation. In policy terms interventions were proposed across eight policy domains, interventions which all found echo both in a subsequent research paper \( **R6**\) and in the amendment of existing policies. *“Mr. Failler’s work with colleagues from the Maritime Affairs Unit of the MOFA was instrumental in initiating moves towards a Blue Economy/Blue Governance approach to ocean governance in Bangladesh. The six\-point solutions advocated in just one policy domain \(fisheries management\) have already led the government to enforce restrictions on fishing \(including catching and selling undersized fish\), in an effort to boost fish stocks, many of which are on the brink of collapse and indeed, it has paved the right pathway towards a sustainable fisheries management.”* \( **S7**\). 

1.  **The Seychelles \(2019\-\):** 

 The Seychelles established a Department for Blue Economy to coordinate the country’s sustainable development strategy in 2015. In January 2018 it adopted the BE Strategic Policy “Roadmap” 2018\-2030 which mandated the development of strategic guidelines for the development of a sustainable ocean\-based economy. Failler, given his expertise, was asked in April 2019 to develop a Blue Economy Vision for the Seychelles. The *Blue Economy Action Plan* \( **S4**\) was approved in April 2020. It; \(i\) proposed practical ways to address the gaps in existing BE policy documents; \(ii\) identified priority areas for BE interventions, and \(iii\) offered a detailed set of actions for the next five years. The Plan advocated a governance framework that emphasised the importance of blue financing and integration across aquatic sectors, while highlighting the need for policy to be informed by an understanding of culture and the social impact of changes in the ocean environment. Embedded centrally within the Action Plan was a commitment to develop a blue natural accounting framework. According to Mr Kenneth Racombo, Principal Secretary at the Ministry of Fisheries and the Blue Economy \(Republic of Seychelles\), Failler’s *“ideas and counsels have played a major role in helping bring this policy document to fruition”*. \( **S8**\). 

1.  **The Bahamas \(2019\-\):** 

 Following the adoption of its first National Maritime Policy in 2015, the approximately 100 islands making up the Commonwealth of the Bahamas chose to embrace BE principles for the valorisation of its ocean space and the diversification of its economy. Failler was contracted in September 2019, and the *Bahamas Strategy for Blue Activities* over the period 2020\-2025 was delivered and approved in Summer 2020. Though it shares similarities with the strategy for Seychelles, in that it encourages cross\-sector and cross\-ministry cooperation, as well as regional integration of management, it focuses more on the use of NCP arguments to justify the mitigation of hazards, the reconstruction of natural coastal defences and enhancing the resilience of ecosystems \( **R3**\). This was perhaps logical as the impact of Hurricane Dorian \(August\-September 2019\) made all too clear to national policy\-makers the importance of coastal ecosystem restoration if the country were to cope with future climate change\-related events. As a direct result of the strategy, the Inter\-American Development Bank \(IDB\) provided a loan of USD200,000 to the country to finance the BG strategy, including the restoration of reefs on the two islands that were almost entirely submerged during Hurricane Dorian \- Grand Bahama and Great Abaco \(which have a combined population of almost 65,000 people\) \( **S9**\). 

 Together, the above international and national impacts have contributed to shifting discourses relating to aquatic ecosystems in order to better recognise their importance beyond economic output, instead considering their more holistic role in terms of NCP and climate change mitigation.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Over the past two decades, decision\-making in disaster risk management has evolved from a predominantly centralised, ‘command and control’ style of management to more ‘people\-centred’ approaches involving local participation. Northumbria University research has identified strategies for risk reduction of infectious diseases that focus on affected communities’ vulnerabilities and capabilities. Professor Andrew Collins’ research is now integral to the health policies of the United Nations \(UN\) Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction with 109 signatory countries and has guided the World Health Organisation’s \(WHO\) Framework for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management. On the ground, Collins’ research helped to refocus UN development practices in Mozambique towards enhancing community\-response capacity. It has also improved public health policies and hand\-washing facilities in schools in Nairobi, Kenya, that have contributed to reduced sickness, improved school attendance and performance, and increased personal responsibility for wellbeing in school children.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Under the auspices of the Disaster and Development Network \(DDN\) at Northumbria University, Professor Andrew Collins has worked with communities at risk of disaster across the world to develop new insights into enhancing disaster preparedness. Collins’ research has developed, applied, and tested the people\-centred disaster risk reduction \(DRR\) model with project partners in communities across the world in highly vulnerable locations. Collins’ research in marginalised communities has highlighted the lack of physical and institutional infrastructure in the most disaster\-prone areas. Top\-down DRR approaches in these contexts neglect to engage local communities and consequently fail to mobilise preparedness and response in the face of combined socioeconomic and environmental threats \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Collins’ research demonstrates the efficacy of embedding people\-centred approaches, catalysing community engagement, and maximising local knowledge \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. Community resilience is empowered through self\-coordinated engagement and communication, reducing dependence on external support \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 Collins’ research investigates mitigating vulnerabilities through a focus on capabilities, specifically in a risk reduction context. Solutions co\-designed with local communities through responsive and innovative people\-centred methodologies reduce vulnerabilities to disasters and the associated precarity and long\-term risk of disease. Key components include community ownership of risk assessment. When risk assessment and management are governed locally and localised or indigenous knowledge is incorporated, then capacity is strengthened \[ **R3**\]. 

  

 Grounded in investigations of infectious disease risk reduction using hazard vulnerabilities and capabilities, Collins’ work includes the world’s first integrated infectious disease risk reduction programme based on DRR assessment and early warning principles established by Collins in Beira, Mozambique \[ **R4**\]. Collins’ research of Infectious Disease Risk Management showed that recognition of socio\-economic and behavioural influences, alongside pathogenic and environmental hazards, reveals risks that vary in nature from place to place over time \[ **R4**\]. In Bangladesh, Collins carried out a project to establish the potential of a health security approach to disaster resilience among people living in high\-risk environments. This identified the ways in which local, support\-led services can empower communities to develop resilience and organise themselves in the face of disaster vulnerability and respond better to the human security agenda more widely \[ **R5**\]. 

 Collins’ research and engagement projects in marginalised communities prioritise the generation of multiple types of data that amplify the people\-centred approach. There are significant difficulties in generating context\-specific data in marginalised communities. These communities are in most need of bespoke policies and practices supporting a local\-level response, drawing on local knowledge. This research challenges the orthodoxies that govern data collection by international agencies by promoting three types: numeric, narrative, and visual data. The term ‘action data’, coined by Collins, is targeted not on the top\-down application of generic categories for data\-capture, but on uncovering and recording the distinct experiences unique to the communities themselves \[ **R6**\]. Action data refers to data that effects change; this sort of data creates a voice that can be operational at all levels of human engagement in disaster prevention and response and forms a central pillar of the strategy for achieving the UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \(SFDRR\). Through this more sensitised understanding, action data reveals the specific vulnerabilities faced by marginalised communities and enables contextual, variegated, and bespoke responses that empower community\-led preparedness and response to both slow and rapid onset disasters \[ **R6**\]. Action data is highly valuable in extreme environments in developing countries to better understand the vulnerabilities of those exposed to disasters and therefore co\-design strategies and actions to reduce risks \[ **R6**\]. 

 This health\-focussed, people\-centred approach has been co\-developed by Northumbria University as part of its Disaster and Development Network with partners including: the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction \(UNDRR\), the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\), the United Nations Children Fund \(UNICEF\), the United Nations Refugee Agency \(UNHCR\), as well as local Non\-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\). Local communities and marginalised groups were supported to improve disaster preparedness through increased social cohesion, education, and sanitation \[ **R1**, **R3**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Collins’ work has embedded health and people\-centred resilience into disaster reduction programmes at the UN, including the WHO. This impact is delivered at the international strategic and monitoring levels, but also in terms of implementation planning, including laying the groundwork for generating the needed contextual data in the most at\-risk communities. Impact is also felt on the ground in Mozambique and Kenya where work with the UN Development Programme \(UNDP\) and international NGO, No Strings International, has seen the people\-centred approach to local environment and health resilience implemented in vulnerable communities. This approach built on existing local knowledge and enhanced community responsiveness, including new public health policies, teacher training, and hand\-washing facilities in Nairobi schools. 

 **4.1 Embedding health in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction** 

 The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \(SFDRR\) is the UN’s framework for disaster risk reduction, adopted in 2015. It replaced the Hyogo Framework for Action \(HFA\) which was in place between 2005 and 2015. The adoption of SFDRR marks the first time that the fields of health and disaster risk management were substantially interwoven at the global, multisectoral policy level. Collins’ research findings have directly informed the SFDRR by placing a people\-centred and community\-empowering approach to health at the heart of the UN’s DRR response. Through research\-led ‘ *expert contributions*’ to ‘ *stakeholder consultations and the Sendai Framework negotiations*’ and providing ‘ *a key voice for people and public health in the Science and Technology Advisory Group of the UN Office for DRR’* Collins’ research has *‘helped to ensure that health was central to the final agreed text of the SFDRR 2015\-2030*’ \[ **E1**\]. Jonathon Abrahams, Officer for Health Policy in DRR at the WHO, who coordinated the UN process of putting health at the centre of the Sendai Framework, explains, ‘ *there is a clear focus in the Sendai framework principles of a people\-centred and inclusive approach which has been at the core of Professor Collins’ work which has served as a continual reminder to focus on action at the local level*’ \[ **E1**\]. In the foreword to the SFDRR, Margareta Wahlström, Former United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary\-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, notes that a focus on health resilience is one of the ‘ *significant shifts’* as the SFDRR replaces the HFA \[ **E2**, p4\]. Health is ‘ *strongly promoted throughout’* \[ **E2**, p4\] but one of the seven targets of the SFDRR is to ‘ *Substantially reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services, among them health and educational facilities, including through developing their resilience by 2030’* \[ **E2**, p11, target d\]. 

 Collins’ work has guided development of the WHO’s Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management \(HEDRM\) Framework which is designed to deliver on the SFDRR commitments. Abrahams, in coordinating Health Policy in DRR at the WHO, says, ‘ *Collins has been an instrumental member of the core group that has taken forward the WHO Thematic Platform for HEDRM’* and developed the HEDRM Framework in 2019. This Framework, with 194 countries committed to its rules, ‘ *provides guidance to ministries of health and … multisectoral health stakeholders on the functions required to reduce the risks and consequences of emergencies and disasters*’ \[ **E1**\]. 

 195 countries are required to report on progress against the SFDRR annually. In addition to guiding the health policy of the SFDRR, Mami Mizutori, the current Special Representative for UNDRR to the Secretary General, explains the importance of Collins’ ongoing role in the Framework’s successful execution, saying, his ‘ *engagement and thought leadership in this critical phase of the implementation of the Sendai Framework in close coherence with the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Climate Agreement has helped lay the ground for UNDRR and our partners to better promote and support risk\-informed decision\-making and investment across all 2030 agendas’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 In 2019, the UNDRR commissioned Collins to write a report on the uses of action data in DRR to enhance the capacity of international agencies and local communities to deliver the appropriate data that underpins the most effective responses to disaster risk \[ **E4**\]. Ricardo Mena, Director of UN Office for DRR, explains Collins worked closely with his office ‘ *to apply his research findings on Action Data and significant project experience*’ into this report, and that this ‘ *policy document provides the framework for the UNDRR Science and Technology Advisory Group \(STAG\) Data Working Group, a key element of the Sendai Framework implementation*’ \[ **E5**\]. As a result, there is now a ‘ *new emphasis on Action Data at the heart of the ongoing implementation and monitoring of the Sendai Framework*’ \[ **E5**\]. 

 **4.2 Implementing a people\-centred approach in vulnerable communities** 

 To support implementation of community capacity enhancement policies on the ground, Collins has worked closely with the UN Development Programme \(UNDP\) in Mozambique. Dr Titus Kuuyuor, Chief Technical Advisor for DRR/Climate Change Adaptation at UNDP for Mozambique, confirms that Collins’ research and research\-informed expertise has addressed challenges the UNDP and other development agencies face at the community level. Dr Kuuyuor explains: ‘ *most agencies, including UNDP, are based in Maputo and \[are\] unable to provide ongoing capacity development and advice due to the distances involved, exacerbated by the high staff turnover*’ \[ **E6**\]. Collins’ research on locally informed responses and capacity led to community volunteers serving on Local Risk Management Boards, creating *‘an important link between community level disaster risk management and government’* and changing UNDP policy towards *‘enhancing community knowledge and skills in preparedness and planning and developing early warning systems’* \[ **E6**\]. As Dr Kuuyuor puts it: ‘ *after working with Collins … we refocused our capacity\-strengthening initiatives on different scales and … working with local officials in communities is proving far more effective for embedding resilience to disasters*’ \[ **E6**\]. 

 Beyond the UN, Collins has worked with NGOs directly embedded within communities to enhance their locally led response capacity, engaging with Collins’ research and expert advice on local resilience to implement child\-led approaches to risk communication \[ **E7**\]. No Strings International \(NSI\), an NGO working internationally to improve children’s health and hygiene, ‘ *revised \[their\] practices towards a child\-centred risk reduction approach in Nairobi*’ \[ **E7**, p2\]. Rosie Waller, Programme Manager for NSI, explains that the application of the child\-centred approach has helped with ‘ *engaging the children, getting them excited to learn about hand\-washing, and embed best hygiene practices in school and taking those lessons home to share with their family*’ \[ **E7**, p2\]. NSI work in five schools in Nairobi taught hand\-washing and good hygiene to all pupils aged 6 to 15. They use puppetry, interactive crafts, and performance activities to engage and place children at the centre of the learning experience \[ **E8**\]. This approach has urged greater responsibility than is customary in classrooms, embedding the children as agents of change for risk reduction while at the same time heightening their awareness of personal wellbeing \[ **E7**\]. The Ministry of Education have since adopted this approach, *‘there is now an emphasis on child\-centred methodologies or strategies, which helps the children to absorb more of what they are taught … these \[new methodologies\] are passed on to the master trainers who train TOT's \(Trainers of Trainers\), who then train the teachers. When you have trained teachers, you have trained children*’ \[ **E7**, p7\]. In addition, children practice this at home *‘so the whole community are now affected*’ \[ **E7**, p11\]. To spread these benefits of child\-centred learning, ‘ *public health strategy is now to train the teachers and school health club together with the head of the school and the school management committee, which includes parents … due to this there is a lot of improvement*’ \[ **E7**, p12\]. Successes have been rewarded by an expansion in classroom sanitation facilities: *‘If you go to the schools now, water points are in almost all of the schools and being used correctly’* \[ **E7**, p8\]. Erik Inda, the Public Health Hygiene Coordinator for 2,500 schools in Nairobi, has ‘ *seen a measurable decrease in faecal and related diseases at the class level*’ where these projects have run \[ **E7**, p5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The multidisciplinary teams in Materials and Mechanical Engineering at Imperial focusing on aero\-engine performance have contributed pivotal understanding to the structural integrity of aero\-engine discs and blades addressing the degradation and failure processes of cold dwell fatigue and salt corrosion, and to engine vibration optimisation. 

 The underpinning research into the mechanistic basis of the degradation and failure process termed **dwell fatigue** has delivered the safe envelope of conditions for aero\-engine flight loading to avoid this catastrophic failure, and has enabled substantive retirement of high\-cost \(<ins>around GBP1,000,000 per</ins> <ins>test</ins>\) engine disc spin testing programmes. It has enabled the relaxation of the disc inspection regime and additional engine overhauls, <ins>saving</ins> <ins>around GBP100,000,000</ins><ins>/year in reduced maintenance regimes</ins>.  The research has also facilitated the closing out of aero\-engine ‘red\-tops’ \(urgent safety priority investigations\) in 2015, 2019, and continuing in 2020. The international research standing led to membership of the USA FAA consortium \(GE, P&W, RR, IHI, USAF\) as the only UK academic group, influencing international aviation safety policy. The research in mechanistic understanding of salt corrosion of aero\-engine components led to substantively reduced test programmes on the TP400 aero\-engine programme, <ins>saving over</ins> GBP<ins>40</ins><ins>,000,000</ins> in 2014 alone, and the lifting of costly potential flight envelope restrictions. Research to improve the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics and in non\-linear engine vibrations for gas turbines established cause of vibration with the Trent 1000 engine, which eliminated blade root cracking and thus lifted the grounding of the Trent 1000 fleet. High vibration levels were eliminated in a development engine \(Br700NG\) allowing certification to be achieved on time.  The research in non\-linear vibration was key to design of the new Rolls\-Royce MMM \(design method\) directly impacting the design of next generation turbine blades for the UltraFan<sup>®</sup> engine.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prof Fionn Dunne \(2012\), Prof David Dye \(2000\), Dr Christoph Schwingshackl \(2006\) and Prof Mehdi Vahdati \(1989\) collectively bring their expertise in metallurgy, micromechanics and dynamics to focus on aero\-engine structural integrity to ensure safety. Their underpinning research addressing fatigue, corrosion cracking and vibration delivers the structural integrity of safety\-critical bladed disc components fabricated from titanium alloys. The research, reported in \(R1 to R9\), underpinning the impacts \(I1 to I5\) is summarised as follows. 

1.  **Cold dwell fatigue \[R1 to R4; I1, I2\]:** dwell fatigue is a defect nucleation and failure process in titanium alloys which may lead to uncontained aero\-engine failure; uncontained failure can compromise the aircraft. The Figure shows a recent example \(full report at  [https://www.bea.aero/uploads/tx\_elydbrapports/BEA2017\-0568.en.pdf](https://www.bea.aero/uploads/tx_elydbrapports/BEA2017-0568.en.pdf)\) and the subsequent FAA investigation resulted in an airworthiness directive estimating a liability of USD780,000 per engine \[E1\]. Across the aircraft fleet, this gives a potential exposure of US$350,000,000 to the engine manufacturer. Our research in dwell fatigue has prevented this kind of failure in Rolls\-Royce engines. 

 
 Work by Dunne \(2013\-19\) and Dye \(2000\-19\) utilised microstructure modelling to explain the temperature sensitivity of dwell fatigue \[R1\], resulting from differing temperature sensitivities of slip strengths and thermally\-activated dislocation escape, providing predictive modelling capability. The research also established the intrinsic slip system rate sensitivities of the two key phases in these alloys for the first time. This facilitated assessment of the microstructures which cause dwell fatigue and  demonstrated that it is microstructure which is key to dwell sensitivity, as opposed to chemistry. Subsequent study on the performance of Rolls\-Royce engine components showed the multiaxial stress states to be important and explained facet crack locations observed in disc spin tests. The resulting paper \[R2\] was awarded the Rolls\-Royce UTC top publication prize in 2017. This and subsequent research established a predictive modelling capability for dwell, recently reported in Nature \[R3\], which explained the very different dwell fatigue observations in \(isothermal\) disc spin tests compared to in\-service \(anisothermal\) disc performance. This research was underpinned by EPSRC programme grant ‘HexMat’ \[R4\] for which Dunne was PI, and the research recognised by the award of the IoM<sup>3</sup>’s Harvey Flower Prize \(2016\) for ‘outstanding contributions towards the science and technology of titanium’ \[R5\]. 

1.  **Stress corrosion cracking \[R5\-R7; I3\]:** research in titanium led by Dye \(2014 to 2019\) provided understanding of low\-life spin test \(GBP300,000/test\) results in aero\-engine discs for the TP400 engine programme. The research established mechanistic understanding of the chemo\-mechanical events leading to corrosion degradation giving rise to the material defect characterised as ‘blue spot’ at the crack initiation site. The observations in aero\-engine components were replicated by specimen testing, which facilitated the mechanistic investigations. It was found using FIB\-SIMS that a region of enhanced Na and Cl developed adjacent to the crack initiation point, at levels that had previously been undetectable by SEM\-EDX \[R6\]. In TEM, different dislocation structures were also observed \[R7\]. Confirmatory work by STEM\-EDX on the fracture surface also helped determine the reaction sequence and rationalise why these failures are observed in elevated temperature, low pressure testing but not at compressor pressure in operating jet engines. Further work to examine the effects of hydrogen during the corrosion reactions was difficult but has proved very important, and the amount of testing retired as a consequence of this programme of work was in excess of GBP40,000,000 in 2014 alone. The research in \[R7\] was recognised by the TMS Science Award 2018 ‘for notable contributions to scientific understanding’ \[R8\]. 

1.  **Engine vibration \[R8, R9; I4, I5\]:** research by Vahdati \(2009\-19\) in aeroelasticity has improved accuracy of computational fluid dynamics models for gas turbines. Understanding of flutter and rotating stall \[R9\] was achieved and extreme events such as bird strike and engine ‘blade\-off’ conditions have been addressed. Vahdati designed and implemented more efficient solvers which reduce computational time and allow investigation of a wider range of parameters. Schwingshackl \(2008\-2019\) investigated phenomena associated with non\-linear engine vibrations, understanding the behaviour of under\-platform dampers, which control the vibration amplitude in turbines \[R10\]. This was achieved with a novel high order nonlinear dynamic modelling approach and new experimental methods giving improved understanding of the behaviour of frictional interfaces under oscillatory loading.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Imperial College’s Materials and Mechanical Engineering Departments have long been associated with the understanding, and the performance, of safety\-critical aero\-engine materials. As a consequence, we have had very close collaborations with Rolls\-Royce \(the Rolls\-Royce Vibration and Nuclear UTCs; the RR Strategic Partnership\) over decades facilitating research and technology transfer to Rolls\-Royce directly.  International impact and uptake results through membership of Federal Aviation Administration \(FAA\) partnerships with international industries including Pratt & Whitney, GE, TIMET, IHI and USAF. In addition, Rolls\-Royce have recruited many of our graduating PhD students and two Royal Society Industry Fellowships, each over four years, have facilitated intimate, long\-term collaborations \(Dye from Imperial to Rolls\-Royce \(2018 to 2022\); Maclachlan from Rolls\-Royce to Imperial \(2018 to 2022\); Dunne RAEng/Rolls\-Royce research chair, 2015 to 2020 \[ [<ins>Current and recent awards \- Royal Academy of Engineering \(raeng.org.uk\)</ins>](https://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-prizes/grants/support-for-research/research-chairs/current-and-recent-awards)\]\). The five major impacts \( **I1 to I5**\) resulting, their links to the underpinning research, and the evidence to support them, are detailed in the following within three areas of aero\-engine performance where national and international uptake have been achieved: A\) eliminating **cold dwell fatigue**, B\) assuring against **blue spot corrosion**, and C\) optimising **engine vibration**. 

 **A. Cold Dwell Fatigue Failures** 

 Dwell fatigue is an aero\-engine failure process associated with holds at load \(e.g. during aircraft take off and cruise\) in titanium fan and compressor discs. In a series of EPSRC\-supported studentships and grants \(EP/K034332\), the Imperial team has developed world\-leading understanding \[R1, R2, R3\] and then resolution of this safety issue, which is worth many millions of British Pounds to Rolls\-Royce \[E2, E3\]. This impact arises in improved understanding of dwell providing **\(I1\) the safe envelope of conditions where dwell fatigue can be avoided**, **with consequent** **retirement of very high\-cost spin testing programmes \(GBP800,000/test\), and the relaxation of the inspection regime \(additional overhauls\).** Rolls\-Royce states: 

 *“the reduced time taken for the tests means … the difference between actually being able to certify and use a new alloy, or not. The cost of a stand\-alone alloy certification programme would be in the <ins>range £500M to £1B</ins>, and as a result, prohibitive”* \[E2\]. 

 The underpinning research to allow this quantified safe stress limits in discs \[R2\], and explained the link between isothermal spin tests and in\-service \(anisothermal\) behaviour \[R1\] through establishment of predictive modelling tools \[R2, R3\]. The research in dwell \[R1, R2, R3\] also facilitated **\(I2\)** **the close\-out of several ‘red\-tops’ \(urgent safety priority investigations\), with the impact of saving many millions of GBP**, **eliminating further disc testing programmes.** Rolls\-Royce states: 

 “*the research has provided sufficient mechanistic understanding to determine that we did not have to take draconian fleet management of … a recent major safety concern related to dwell fatigue behaviour in complex thermomechanical load regimes experienced in the engines. An overly conservative approach to cold dwell threatens the company on commercial grounds \(multiple £100M\) through engine removals and disc replacement, a non\-conservative approach could result in significant loss of life*” \[E2\]. 

 The industrial impact is also evidenced by the Sir Henry Royce Award 2017 \[E4\] for Technical Innovation by Rolls\-Royce for our work on dwell fatigue \[R2\].   Dunne and Dye are the only UK dwell experts to be invited to join the USA’s FAA dwell fatigue partnership of aero\-engine manufacturers Pratt & Whitney, GE, Honeywell, Rolls\-Royce, and IHI, influencing the management of aero\-engine dwell fatigue internationally \[E3, E5\]. 

 **B. Blue Spot Corrosion** 

 In the testing campaign supporting the qualification of the TP400 jet engine for the A300M transport aircraft, some low\-life failures occurred associated with a characteristic corrosion defect \(termed ‘blue spot’\) on the fracture surface. This raised concerns about this alloy and its use across a much broader jet engine fleet in service. An EPSRC\-supported CASE PhD studentship on this topic resulted in the determination that this feature was associated with NaCl hot salt stress corrosion cracking; the mechanistic understanding generated \[R5, R6\] allowed this safety concern to be resolved, with the impact **\(I3\) of saving over GBP40,000,000 in retired testing on the TP400 programme in 2014** alone, and much more across Rolls\-Royce as a whole including the lifting of potential flight envelope restrictions. Rolls\-Royce state “ *reducing the cyclic life of Ti6246 alloy discs by \~25% would have cost us in excess of £500M*” \[E2\]\). The industrial impact is evidenced by the Rolls\-Royce Engineering Excellence Award 2014 \[E6\] for our work on Blue Spot Corrosion \[R5, R6\]. 

 **C. Engine Vibration** 

 Research has been pivotal in developing understanding of key aspects of the cause of vibration issues with the Trent 1000 engine, relying on our unique capability to accurately simulate blade forced response \[R8\]. This understanding identified design changes which **\(I4\) eliminated blade root cracking and thus lifted the grounding of the Trent 1000 fleet, and delivered the AU3D code to eliminate high vibration levels on a development engine \(Br700NG\) through unique virtual engine testing** at Imperial, allowing certification to be achieved on time.  Rolls\-Royce states: “ *during 2018, I was deployed to lead part of the Trent 1000 problem investigation team and we relied heavily on work done at Imperial College to \(i\) reach an understanding of the root cause, \(ii\) map out the main risk factors \(iii\) redesign the components and \(iv\) support certification of the redesigned parts. The cost of this issue with Trent 1000 has been reported in the Rolls\-Royce Annual Report \(February 2020\) to be $2.4 billion”* \[E7\]. The underpinning research carried out led to very substantial financial savings.  The research also contributed to subsequent engine development and provided design improvements which go significantly beyond that which would have been available through testing alone \[E7\].  Our work on non\-linear vibration has included explicit modelling of under\-platform dampers \(UPDs\) \[R9\] resulting in a fully validated approach to reliably capture damping performance due to frictional slip at the damper/platform interfaces. This delivered **\(I5\) the development of a flutter free design system which has been embodied within the UltraFanR engine**, **and which** **formed a key input to the new Rolls\-Royce MMM \(design method\) for UPDs having direct impact on the design of next generation turbine blades in this engine,** resulting in significant cost saving and significant competitive advantage \[E7\]. Safer and more reliable operation has enabled Rolls\-Royce to obtain increased performance for the new turbine core design in the UltraFan®. Rolls\-Royce said “ *the Rolls\-Royce UltraFan® is an exciting technological leap. The knowhow and tools developed by the Imperial team has allowed the vibration threats to be understood from the outset, particularly flutter. This allows the fan system to be optimised without adding conservatism for unknown vibration risks, freeing the design space to deliver a reduction in CO2, NOx*” \[E7\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at SOAS has dramatically and significantly improved responses to migration and displacement in the Horn of Africa \(HoA\). The Research and Evidence Facility \(hereafter the Facility\) led by Prof Laura Hammond has influenced major policy and funding decisions of a range of actors, including the European Union, the Government of Somalia, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. Facility reports were used to design EU interventions in the HoA, including a EUR63,500,000 regional borderlands development programme and a EUR3,000,000 coordination platform. These were urgently needed, evidence\-based improvements that promote better migration management and welfare of displaced populations.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Facility conducts policy\-relevant primary research in nine countries of the Greater Horn of Africa \(HoA\) to understand the drivers, dynamics and implications of migration and displacement within the region. Fourteen million people are displaced in the HoA \(including refugees, internally displaced, and returnees\) – 70% of all displaced populations in Africa and more than 20% of the global total. Many more voluntary migrants move within and from the region in search of economic or educational opportunity. The Facility’s research is framed in response to key migration issues identified by the European Union \(EU\) in the region to directly support policy and programming, providing in\-depth analysis on the context in which EU projects are being implemented. 

 Laura Hammond, Professor of Development Studies at SOAS, is Team Leader of the Facility, which was established in 2016 with funds from the EU Trust Fund for Africa \(EUR6,600,000 2016\-2022\). Based at SOAS, the Facility partners with the University of Manchester and Nairobi\-based Sahan Research, and works with over 50 researchers from the HoA region. Through the Facility, Prof Hammond has led research projects on displacement and return in Somalia **\[3.2\]**; development challenges in borderland regions \(South Sudan\-Uganda\-Kenya and Somalia/Somaliland\-Djibouti\-Ethiopia\) **\[3.1, 3.3\]**; movement between the Horn of Africa and Yemen **\[3.4\]** and refugee hosting policies and practices in Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia and Uganda **\[3.5\]**. 

 All research involved in\-person surveys, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. In insecure areas \(e.g. South Central Somalia\) data was collected by researchers based in the localities with careful remote supervision led by Hammond. Further data was collected in analysis workshops, where preliminary research findings and recommendations were presented to stakeholder groups and then refined based on feedback. 

  

 Important findings have emerged from the Research and Evidence Facility’s research. A study on migration between the HoA and Yemen found that environmental threats tend to generate short\-distance displacement rather than longer\-distance movement. During the severe 2017 Horn of Africa drought, migration from the HoA to Europe and the Gulf countries increased only marginally. Many more people moved shorter distances within the region, often settling in border towns, refugee camps or in the nearest urban area **\[3.4\]**. 

 A study of displacement in, and return to, Somalia found that the most significant need of migrants, internally displaced persons and refugee returnees to urban centres of Somalia was housing, land and property \(HLP\); failure to secure these basic resources blocked people’s ability to invest in education, healthcare, and other key areas, or to plan for their futures **\[3.2\].** 

 An assessment of the implementation of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework in four countries \(Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, Uganda\) found that Intergovernmental Authority on Development \(IGAD\) plays an important, but often unrecognised, role in stimulating political will at the highest level and coordinating refugee hosting practices within the region, encouraging best practice leading to concrete policy improvements particularly with respect to education, jobs and livelihoods **\[3.5\]**. 

 This body of research builds upon other work by Hammond on rural\-urban migration in Somaliland, part of the 2016\-18 Migrants on the Margins project \(GBP1,000,000 funded by the Royal Geographical Society, ESRC\-DFID and AHRC\) that considered the experiences of former pastoralists displaced from their rural livelihoods into urban centres in Hargeisa, Somaliland. Here, too, securing land and property was a prerequisite to comprehensive integration into the city.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The work of the Facility led by Hammond has improved the design and delivery of EU\-funded migration and displacement programmes in the HoA. Research recommendations have shaped projects by intergovernmental organisations and donors related to development of borderlands, support for displaced persons in urban areas, and reintegration support for internally displaced persons and repatriated refugees. This work has led to regional approaches that promote social cohesion between migrant and displaced populations and their hosts, and create economic opportunities for mobile populations. Hammond’s related research on rural\-urban migration has also led to award\-winning secondary school teaching resources in the UK, developed with the Royal Geographical Society. A film commissioned by Hammond with film makers PositiveNegatives on migration in the HoA \(“Life on the Move”\) won the 2019 Research in Film Award \(Social Media Category\) **\[5.10e\]**. 

####  Improving delivery of EU funding related to migration and displacement in the Horn of Africa 

 To maximize research uptake, the Facility pursued an innovative programme of ‘front\-loaded advocacy,’ collaborating from the inception of the research with EU Trust Fund \(EUTF\) contributing states, EU delegations, governments in the region and NGOs. These actors have contributed to project design, framing of recommendations, and public briefing events including a major conference in Nairobi in 2019 \(140 participants from the research, governmental, nongovernmental, and diplomatic communities\) based on the Facility’s research. This collaboration has ensured receptivity to the research findings and maximized possibilities for uptake of recommendations. 

 Facility research was directly used as evidence in the design of key EUTF investments: 1\) a EUR63,500,000 project to promote cross\-border development collaboration in the HoA **\[5.1\]** and 2\) a EUR3,000,000 project to support IGAD’s role in coordinating a regional approach to refugee management and protection. EUTF Manager Hans Stausboll stated that EU support to IGAD was “a result of this research” and that the research had “stimulated \[IGAD’s\] Member States into adopting remarkable policy commitments in favour of refugees particularly in the areas of education, health and livelihood.” **\[5.2\]** 

####  Influencing new policy approaches and agendas among states, intergovernmental organisations and third sector actors 

 Under Prof Hammond’s leadership, the Facility’s high profile advocacy work has influenced policy and practice on displacement. Prof Hammond was invited by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to moderate two plenary sessions at the first Global Refugee Forum \(December 2019\), one on Regional Responses to Refugee Hosting, the other on Durable Solutions. The Forum, attended by more than 3,000 participants, included heads of state, ministers, ambassadors and heads of international UN and nongovernmental organisations. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi acknowledged Hammond’s contribution to the success of the event in identifying solutions and comprehensive responses in action both as “moderator during high\-level sessions” and for the “insights \[Hammond\] brought to the discussion” **\[5.3\]**. The Forum raised over 840 pledges for refugee support including job creation and education schemes, and the development of clean energy and infrastructure **\[5.3\]**. 

 UNHCR’s Special Envoy for Africa, Ambassador Mohamed Affey, commended the Facility’s work by saying, “We’ve been very impressed by the reports that we have received regarding the return of the population of the Somalis who have been living in the refugee camps for many years. That research and the report that was generated as a result of the research that was done have been of use to me as a Special Envoy in my advocacy work” **\[5.4 time code: 00:01:33 – 00:01:50\]**. 

 In December 2018, Hammond was invited to give written and oral evidence to the International Development Committee of the UK House of Commons enquiry on Refugees in East Africa. She argued that 1\) post\-Brexit, the UK’s continued support for displaced populations in East Africa was crucial; 2\) migration within Africa is an essential livelihood strategy for maximizing resources and minimizing risk; 3\) the right to safe mobility should be protected alongside efforts to prevent displacement and irregular migration; 4\) asylum seekers in the UK should be allowed to work while they await a decision on their cases; and 5\) there should be a more joined\-up approach to supporting refugees in the UK and in regions of origin. These points were all included in the committee’s final report ‘Forced Displacement in Africa: Anchors Not Walls, where Hammond’s evidence was cited nine times **\[5.5\]**. As of 2020, work on several of these points was being implemented, including 1, 2 and 5 by the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office. 

####  Impact on policy and practice in Somalia and the Horn of Africa region 

 In the region, the work of the Facility has influenced debates and policies of information\-based NGOs such as the Regional Durable Solutions Secretariat \(ReDSS\). Secretariat Manager of ReDss, Aude Galli stated the report on Return and \(Re\)integration after Displacement **\[3.2\]** “has concretely informed a number of durable solutions programing in Somalia, but also donors\[‘\] priorities and focus.” Galli also commended the Facility for “providing a platform bringing practitioners, policy\- makers and researchers together to discuss the implications and recommendations from the research findings to inform and adapt our policy and programing work.” **\[5.6\]** 

 Responding to the Facility’s recommendation that IDPs and returnees need secure land tenure and should be integrated into local development plans, the Municipality of Baidoa in Somalia relocated 100 returnee families onto permanent plots in 2019, giving them secure tenure **\[5.7, pg 4\]**. Prof Hammond was also asked to advise on the drafting of Somalia’s National Policy on Refugees, Returnees and Displaced Persons; all 12 of her major recommendations were adopted into the final enacted policy in 2019 **\[5.8\]**, including providing legal support to displaced people, extending protection to include social and economic vulnerability and extending food assistance to returnees for a full year after return. 

  

####  Increasing young people’s understanding of migration issues in the UK 

 Hammond’s related research on rural\-urban migration was used to develop a suite of award\-winning teaching materials for secondary school students in collaboration with the Royal Geographical Society. These included a 2019 Teach Company award \(curriculum impact category\), Scottish Association of Geography Teachers Overall Winner **\[5.9a\]** and finalist for the 2020 BETT awards **\[5.9b\]**. The film’ Life on the move’ produced in partnership with PositiveNegatives was awarded the 2019 AHRC Research in Film Award for ‘Best Social Media Short’ **\[5.9c and d\]**. The teaching materials included two posters on urban migration distributed to every secondary school \(5500 schools\) in England and Wales, teaching videos featuring lectures by Hammond and other project researchers, 2,500 copies of comics produced by partners PositiveNegatives, and infographics **\[5.10a\]**. The project also hosted two public exhibitions \(October and December 2018 – 969 attendees\), a major Fellows’ lecture at the Royal Geographical Society \(Oct 2018, 441 attendees, 171 online views\) **\[5.10b\]** Student attendees to the exhibition, which was paired with a workshop on the themes covered, praised the way that the human migration stories were presented. Two students from Westminster Academy said, ‘The exhibition was really good and eye\-opening to social issues we may not think about on a daily basis. Enables students to reflect on global issues’ **\[5.10c, p6\]**. Another student said that the exhibition ‘helped me decide whether to do Geography’ \[at A\-level\] **\[5.10c, p3\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** Cutting\-edge research into Spanish art has driven cultural regeneration in County Durham. Beresford’s research has directly benefitted public access to Spanish art and understanding of its place in the county’s heritage, via the rediscovery and display of lost paintings, as well as promoting public understanding of the distinctive qualities of Spanish art, especially its approach to violence and pain. Beresford has organised exhibitions, shaped business models and informed public engagement strategies at The Bowes Museum \(an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation in Barnard Castle\) and The Auckland Project \(a regeneration venture in Bishop Auckland\). At the Bowes, he helped secure GBP135,000 for a Curator of Spanish Art and to save a GBP3,300,000 painting for the nation; at the Auckland, he provided the academic case for a successful GBP9,000,000 Heritage Lottery Fund bid for a new Spanish Gallery, and formed partnerships leading to a loan agreement with the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid, bringing important Spanish artworks to County Durham. His eye\-tracking research then shaped their public presentation. The County’s collections have been brought to international prominence via loans to museums abroad, and regional cultural policy is now focussing on Spanish art as a path to regeneration. Beresford also played a pivotal role in securing GBP600,000 Santander Group funding for, and in designing, the Zurbarán Centre, a joint Durham University/Auckland Project institution devoted to promoting understanding of Spanish art, which has produced impact via an exhibition at Dulwich Picture Gallery. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** Andrew M. Beresford’s research into Spanish art has three main facets: interpretative work, especially on the relationship between suffering and piety; art\-historical work, uncovering the presence and prominence of Spanish art in County Durham; and experimental digital humanities work on eye\-tracking. **R1**, edited with the Curator of Art at the Auckland, offers the first systematic analysis of Durham’s wide\-ranging \(but largely unstudied\) holdings in Spanish art, the most extensive in the UK outside London. Beresford contributed two essays, focusing on Durham Cathedral and the University Colleges, jointly authoring three others with local curators: on Zurbarán’s cycle of *Jacob and his Twelve Sons*, the two sets of Apostle paintings acquired in the 1750s, and the stately homes of County Durham \(including Raby Castle, Rokeby Park, Wynyard Park, and Windlestone Hall\). The volume’s nine essays provide an in\-depth account of the history and significance of Durham’s Spanish artworks, informed by first\-hand examination. **R1** is vital to the impact as it revealed the extent of the holdings of Spanish art in the County and led to the rediscovery of lost works, opening up pathways for impact. **R2, R3, and R4** provide vital spurs for rethinking the public presentation of artworks characterised by disturbing and/or violent imagery. Beresford relates images of the infant Christ to the medieval obsession with suffering and pain, focusing on the culture of somatic \(or body\-centric\) piety and its effect on personal bonds. Depictions of St Bartholomew, who was flayed alive, and St Margaret, who bursts outwards from the belly of a dragon, trap viewers between competing imperatives—the desire to look vying awkwardly with a compulsion to turn away. **R5**, which appraises the recontextualisation of the Auckland paintings in the works of Jonathan Parker, also shaped the public presentation of art, studying their evolution into regional icons, illustrative of a distinctive North East identity. The cycle is analysed from a scientific perspective in **R6**, which offers original insights into the complexity of audience engagement by modelling how saccades \(or eye movements\) can be redistributed across artworks as a result of written information. Assuming the form of an inter\-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration, led by Beresford, the study explains how the gaze is affected by contextualising labels and how subtle adjustments can retrain viewers to engage with other aspects of composition, thereby enhancing levels of understanding and aesthetic appreciation. This work has had a direct impact on contextualising labels for the new Spanish Gallery in Bishop Auckland.

 **4. Details of the impact  <ins>Overview.**</ins> Beresford’s research on the prominence of Spanish art in County Durham, on violent imagery in such art, and on eye\-tracking in relation to the exhibiting of art, brings together public, cultural, curatorial and economic benefits, affecting which works of art are displayed to the public, and how. His research has been of direct benefit to \(a\) public access to Spanish art and to understanding of its position in County Durham’s heritage, and \(b\) public understanding of the distinctive qualities of Spanish art, particularly the relationship between suffering, pain and piety. He has also worked extensively with \(c\) The Bowes Museum and \(d\) The Auckland Project to secure artworks and funding, to create exhibitions and to change regional tourism development policy. He helped secure funding for \(e\) the Zurbarán Centre, which has worked with the Dulwich Picture Gallery to stage a major exhibition on the art of Jusepe de Ribera. 

 <ins> **\(a\)</ins> <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>Public Access to/Understanding</ins> <ins>of Spanish Art**</ins>. Research for **R1** led directly to the rediscovery of a set of ten ‘lost’ Apostle paintings. Looted by the British Navy from Cádiz in 1702 and then brought to County Durham, the paintings had been displayed in Durham Castle and the Dean and Chapter Library at Durham Cathedral before being removed and forgotten. The discovery, reported in *The Art Newspaper* and the Spanish daily *El Mundo* \( **E1**\), emphasised the pivotal role of Beresford’s research in clarifying the complex provenance of the paintings and their cultural and artistic significance. Two Apostles were included at his suggestion in parallel exhibitions of Spanish artworks organised concurrently at the Auckland \(between 15 October 2014 and 30 October 2015\) and the Bowes \(between 11 Oct 2014 and 1 February 2015\), including *St Bartholomew*, the subject of **R1**. These were put on display along with loans secured through his work in formulating a broader network at locations such as Raby Castle and Ushaw College. Thus, Beresford’s research brought local partners together in pursuit of a common cultural objective, influenced object selection and design at exhibitions jointly hosted by two local institutions, and changed the national and international perception of Spanish art in the County \( **E1**\). **R1** was launched at the Auckland during a public\-facing symposium organised by Beresford to coincide with the two exhibitions noted above: *The Paintings of the Spanish Golden Age: The Collections of County Durham*. This event attracted more than 150 delegates from all over the world and received newspaper, radio, and television coverage. An article in *The Journal* \(23 October 2014\) noted that the Symposium had raised the profile of Spanish art in County Durham along with the cultural richness of the North East more broadly, while *The Northern Echo* recognised that it would have ‘an important economic spin\-off’ \( **E1**\). The emerging collaboration with the Auckland and the Bowes—predicated on increasing awareness of Spanish art’s position in the heritage of County Durham—was thus brought to local, national, and international prominence. 

 <ins> **\(b\)</ins> <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>Public Understanding</ins> <ins>of the Qualities of Spanish Art**</ins>. Research findings in **R1 and R3** were distilled into contextualising labels to accompany artworks at the two exhibitions. Beresford’s research helped explain the centrality of violence to the formation of devotional identities for the benefit of the general public. Working with the Auckland and the Bowes, Beresford organised a public\-facing symposium on skin attended by approximately 50 people \(dealing with issues such as aesthetic responses to images of flaying\), a public\-facing session on the art of County Durham for the World Heritage Site Thirtieth Anniversary Conference attended by approximately 500 people \(discussing suffering in the Durham Cathedral collections\), and 12 public\-facing evening lectures at the Auckland and the Bowes attended by 826 people. Designed to transform attitudes towards the viscerally disturbing qualities of Spanish art, these events drew heavily on Beresford’s research, notably **R2, R3, and R4**, which reveal the competing imperatives on viewers of such works, who experience both a desire to look and an urge to turn away. The events attracted new visitors to both locations, and in each instance, their responses were captured on comment cards \( **E2**\). Over ninety comments were received by members of the general public. They consistently testify to ‘better understanding of the context and purpose \[of still life\]’, with numerous respondents emphasising gender, institutions, collecting, and contemporary relevance. The Bowes Senior Curator testified to a profound change in her understanding: ‘My knowledge and attitude to Spanish art has developed and changed throughout the progress of the Symposium and these lectures so far. All have been excellent and very stimulating. A huge learning curve and a most enjoyable one’. The museum, as a result, opted to make greater use of its Spanish collections, locating difficult and/or disturbing subjects in more prominent positions—notable examples being Tristán’s *Martyrdom of St Andrew* and Goya’s *Interior of a Prison*. They have also, in view of increased audience interest, invited Durham University to work with them on producing a new Spanish catalogue. The same method of data collection was adopted in lectures at Durham School and two public\-facing curated exhibitions: the first, on Salvador Dalí’s lithographs of the Bible, and the second, Jonathan Parker’s recontextualisations of the cycle of *Jacob and his Twelve Sons* \( **R5**\). In each instance, audiences noted that not just their attitude towards Spanish art had changed, but that they had a more meaningful understanding of the significance of suffering and pain. The Durham School organiser commented that the lecture ‘showcased a range of Spanish art: its content, contexts, message, significance, and philosophical implications, from the self\-other distinction to the value of skin, in the context of the gory portrayal of the flaying of St Bartholomew. It was interesting to explore, amongst other things, how such masterpieces have found their way into the North East’ \(School Bulletin, 9 October 2015\). Beresford subsequently launched and served as Academic Director of The Bailey Gallery, which makes the University’s collections publicly available by offering 10 one\-hour tours each year. As Director, Beresford is responsible for object selection and design, and by drawing on research for **R2**, he made previously unseen and uncatalogued paintings such as Alonso Cano’s *Infant Christ Surrounded by the Instruments of the Passion* available for scrutiny. In its first three iterations \(between 2016 and 2019\), visitors to the Gallery commented on how it had transformed their view of the legacy and relevance of Spanish art, leading them to a fuller understanding of the culture of somatic piety and the position of violent imagery within it \( **E3**\). 

 <ins> **\(</ins><ins>c</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>T</ins><ins>he</ins> <ins>Bowes Museum**</ins> Bringing his expertise on the presence of Spanish art in the region, and the collaborative links established through **R1**, Beresford worked with the Bowes on a successful application to the Ellerman Foundation, a philanthropic body committed to developing the arts, which secured a three\-year Curatorship for Spanish Art worth GBP135,000 \( **E4**\). As a result, Spanish artworks are now more prominently managed and displayed, while regional cultural bodies recognise its potential for regeneration: Visit County Durham has made Spanish art a key element of its ‘Tourism Management Plan’, as does the County Durham Cultural Partnership, which works strategically with Durham Council, in its ‘Durham Cultural Vision and Action Plan’ \( **E5**\). Beresford produced the academic case for the GBP3,300,000 acquisition of the Penrhyn *St Luke Painting the Virgin* for a consortium of galleries led by the Bowes. The painting, which was under threat of leaving the UK, has been described by the Minister for Culture as a distinctive and iconic piece, and by Arts Council England as a rare and expressive depiction \( *Guardian*, 27 November 2015\). It was temporarily denied an export licence so that the Bowes\-led consortium could formalise a bid, and the success in keeping it in the UK was widely reported, including by the BBC \(26 July 2016\). Beresford thus influenced museum strategy and physical content, bringing an important work to the region \( **E6**\). He also worked with the Bowes on a programme of public\-facing promotional activities, including a workshop explaining the painting’s symbolism to the public. Since the painting superimposes an image of the crucified Christ onto his infant self, **R2**, which approaches the fusion of selves from a theoretical perspective, it proved pivotal in shaping the broader public understanding of its significance and cultural importance. On the basis of his knowledge of Durham’s collections, Beresford was approached by the Museum’s Curatorial Director to assist with the development and implementation of a new research strategy. This involved strategic targets for the production of research outputs, the dissemination of academic findings through object display, and revised strategies for public engagement. As part of this, the Bowes worked with the University’s Centre for Visual Arts and Culture on establishing a new lecture series, focusing chiefly on the reception and legacy of Spanish art \( **E7**\). Beresford also facilitated the loan of Bowes paintings to the Meadows Museum in Dallas for an exhibition entitled ‘ *El Greco, Goya, and a Taste for Spain: Highlights from The Bowes Museum*’ *,* which ran from 15 September 2019 to 12 January 2020. 

 <ins> **\(</ins><ins>d</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>T</ins><ins>he Auckland Project**</ins> Beresford worked with the Auckland team on a successful GBP9,000,000 Heritage Lottery Fund application, supplying expertise and statistics—produced in relation to **R1, R3, and R5**—on the size and scope of the County’s collections. The grant, one of the biggest made by the Heritage Lottery Fund in the North East of England, has acted as a major catalyst for the regeneration of Bishop Auckland and the surrounding area, bringing job, training and volunteering opportunities. In April 2018, Historic England awarded Heritage Action Zone status to Bishop Auckland, and is now working with Durham County Council and the Brighter Bishop Auckland Regeneration Partnership Board \(of which Durham University is a partner\) to achieve economic growth, using the historic environment as a catalyst. The Auckland Project, a key regeneration partner for this work, has recently reopened Auckland Castle to visitors and is expected to draw significant tourism to the region. The Spanish Gallery is a further Project initiative, for which Beresford made the academic case, leading a cross\-County collaborative engagement based on a re\-contextualisation of Spanish artworks \( **E8**\). Translating and redrafting business pitches in the light of his specialist knowledge on Spanish art, Beresford helped to secure a comprehensive loan agreement for the Gallery from the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid. He prepared a list of key potential loans, many of which have now been included. In advance of the closure of the Long Room for refurbishment, Beresford represented the Auckland on a visit to the Meadows Museum in Dallas, leading to the loan and exhibition of the *Jacob* cycle \(between 17 September 2017 and 7 January 2018\); the cycle was subsequently exhibited at the Frick Collection in New York \(between 31 January and 22 April 2018\) and the Israel Museum, Jerusalem \(between 25 May and 2 October 2018\). These exhibitions marked the first time these paintings were presented in America and Israel, and only the second time in history that they left Auckland Castle. Beresford also organised a meeting at the Auckland with the Spanish Cultural Attaché to discuss strategies for cultural engagement, laying the foundation for a later visit by the Spanish Ambassador, who met various cultural bodies, including Visit County Durham, and Culture Durham, who agreed to embrace Spanish art as a key priority and catalyst for tourism \( **E5**\). Beresford was later invited onto the interview panel as a consultant for the Auckland’s new Curatorship of Spanish Art, a position that has had a direct bearing on the content, orientation, and design of the Spanish Gallery \( **E9**\). He was approached by the Director of the BBC’s *Inside Out*, and appeared as a consultant, discussing Spanish art in the North East and the unique status of the Zurbarán collection. Beresford’s eye\-tracking project has captured scientifically accurate measures of gaze behaviour and audience response, focusing on reactions to challenging, disturbing, and/or taboo subjects in Spanish art. In addition to key arguments incorporated into **R2, R3, and R4**, this work has produced an article on the Auckland Zurbarán paintings \( **R6**\) which describes how revised labelling can produce different types of gaze behaviour and in this way lead to new forms of engagement with samples of Spanish art. Supported by the Auckland curatorial team, the conclusions of this research have been implemented in the form of revised contextualising information for the new Spanish Gallery. This work has had a pivotal bearing on strategies for audience engagement, questions of layout and design, object presentation, and the production of interpreting materials. It has enabled the Auckland Project to transform the presentation and interpretation of its collection, enabling engagement with a more diverse range of visitors \( **E8**\). 

 <ins> **\(e\) Impact</ins> <ins>deriving from</ins> <ins>the Zurbarán Centre**</ins> Growing directly out of Beresford’s collaboration with The Auckland Project, the Zurbarán Centre for Spanish and Latin American Art was launched in 2017. Charged with transforming County Durham into an international hub for Spanish art, the Centre has been funded by a GBP600,000 grant from the Santander Group \(the largest single donation made to a UK university\) and an additional GBP1,000,000 from Durham University \( **E8**\). The Executive Chair of the Santander Group commented on Spanish art and the heritage of County Durham: ‘The work being done by Durham University and the Auckland Project will help to develop a world class centre for sharing and understanding Spain’s art and culture’ \(Press Release, 3 October 2016\) \( **E4**\) **.** In addition to assisting the Auckland team with pitches to the Santander Group, Beresford brought specialist knowledge to bear on the Centre’s design and the recruitment of its Director and administrative team. This funding has supported Zurbarán research fellowships. Edward Payne, Zurbarán research fellow in Spanish Art, co\-curated an exhibition entitled *Ribera’s Art of Violence* \(Dulwich Picture Gallery, between 26 September 2018 and 27 January 2019\). Beresford served as an advisor for this exhibition and delivered a public\-facing curatorial talk on representations of flaying, drawing on findings in **R3**. Research carried out at Durham University has thus informed the presentation of Spanish art beyond the county. The total number of visitors for the Dulwich exhibition was 19,810, leading the exhibitions manager to label it ‘an incredible exhibition that very much set a new calibre here at Dulwich’ \( **E10**\). Reviews have noted that the exhibition offered ‘a brilliant exposé’ of ‘a painter who can make you feel the physical presence of pain, the proximity of a violated body, the raw nightmare sound of an animal yell, pleading for mercy’ \( *Guardian*\). The review adds: ‘The devastating triumph of this exhibition is that it does not just show Ribera’s achievement. It explains it’ \( **E10**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Flexible working is used by many companies worldwide to address the work/life balance needs of workers and to attain gender diversity goals, while enhancing performance outcomes. Chung’s research in this field has made a leading contribution to \(i\) UK Government policies on flexible working and shared parental leave; \(ii\) the introduction of flexible working rights, whilst protecting those who do work flexibly in the EU’s work/life balance directive; and \(iii\) the policy direction and capacity\-building of policy stakeholders and advocacy groups across the world. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Findings from the underpinning research are published in academic research articles and reports led by Chung from 2016. These studies demonstrate the benefits of providing flexible working arrangements to workers, and highlight the possible negative outcomes due to gender\-role stereotyping and the long hours culture. 

 **Flexible working increases the work capacity of mothers:** Using UK longitudinal household data, the research found that women who were able to use flexi\-time, and to work from home were, were much more likely to maintain their working hours and remain in the labour market after childbirth **\[R1\]**. Given that women’s tendency to shift to part\-time jobs or leave employment after childbirth is the most important cause of the gender pay gap, this study provides important evidence of the paramount need to guarantee flexible working rights if we wish to address gender inequalities **\[R1, R2\]**. 

 **Flexible working makes workers work longer:** Analysis of longitudinal household data from Germany and the UK shows that when workers control where and when they work, they tend to work longer \(unpaid\) overtime hours **\[R3, R4\]**. This increase in overtime hours differs by gender; men increase their overtime hours more than women **\[R3, R4\]**. The research also shows that flexible working leads to higher income \- but only for men. Flexible working can potentially lead to an increase in the gender gap in working hours and pay, reinforcing a traditional division of roles **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 One reason is that flexible working is not provided simply to improve work/life balance.  Analysis of European comparative data shows that control over working schedules is not necessarily provided to workers with the greatest family and care demands, but instead to those who are most likely to \(be perceived by employers to\) increase their work intensity and/or provide performance gains for the company. These tend to be higher\-educated, higher\-occupational groups **\[R5\]**. Furthermore, despite the popular belief that women tend to have more flexibility at their jobs, women were no more likely to have access to flexible working arrangements than men. In fact, female\-dominated jobs and sectors provide worse access to flexible working arrangements **\[R5\]**. 

 What is more, flexibility stigma is prevalent and hinders good practice in flexible working: Chung’s results demonstrated that more than one\-third of UK workers hold stigmatic views of flexible working. They believe that flexible workers are not as committed or productive as others, and that flexible working will lead to negative career outcomes **\[R6\]**. Although men are more likely to have stigmatising beliefs, women are more likely to have directly experienced negative career outcomes due to flexible working **\[R6\]**. The prevalence of flexibility stigma is a major reason why, despite the expansion of flexible working policies in the UK, the use of such arrangements has not increased as expected. Furthermore, the prevalence of stigma explains why workers may end up working longer rather than shorter hours when given more freedom at their work.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Chung’s research and activities have influenced domestic and international government policies and associated implementation as follows: 

 **UK Government** 

 Chung’s work highlighting the limitations of existing rights to request flexible working, and demonstrating the importance of shifting norms on childcare responsibility to improve the impact of flexible work policies, was used as evidence by the Women and Equalities Select committee in their 2018 report on fathers and the workplace **\[a\]**. Three significant outcomes have resulted from this. First, in 2019\-20, working closely with Chung as an expert adviser, the UK Government department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) undertook a review of the right to request flexible working policy. Secondly, BEIS carried out employer and employee surveys in 2019\-20 to take account of the limitations of the current policy – in particular, the prevalence of flexibility stigma, and certain groups’ limited access to flexible working. These are issues highlighted in Chung’s research and evidence submitted to the committee. Chung subsequently worked with BEIS in the development and analysis of the data **\[b\]**. Chung also helped BEIS on the development of their Maternity and Paternity Leave Survey of 2019, and sat on the advisory board of the Shared Parental Leave Review. Chung ensured the inclusion of data collection on how flexible working arrangements may help mothers return to work \(earlier\) after childbirth, and how different organisational cultures/flexibility stigma limit not only return to work but also the use of certain family\-friendly arrangements **\[b\]**. 

 Chung also worked closely with the Government Equalities Office \(GEO\), under the UK Cabinet Office, to strengthen their policy capacity to tackle the gender pay gap. She helped draft an employers’ action note **\[b,** **c\]**, and assisted GEO in improving employers’ understanding of the role of family\-friendly arrangements in increasing gender diversity through webinars and workshops \(2018\-20\). 

 Senior departmental staff testify that Chung’s work led to ‘the development of the 2019 survey of parents which is being updated for the first time in a decade’; helped put ‘the Government \[…\] in a strong position to better evaluate current policies and their implementation’; developed Government ‘understanding of what may be encouraging or preventing take\-up of labour market policies for workers across Britain and \[helped\] shape policy thinking’; formed part of ‘the backbone of the Government’s evaluation of Shared Parental Leave’; and has helped ‘to shape the guidance \[…\] of the Workplace and Gender Equality \(WAGE\) Research Programme \[… supporting\] the 10,000 employers \[…\] required to submit gender pay\-gap data annually’. They highlight ‘the significant impact \[Chung’s\] work has had on the development of \[UK\] policy’ **\[b\].** 

 **Overseas Governments** 

 Chung’s research has influenced the development and implementation of the European Commission’s work/life balance directive, affecting the lives of 229 million workers across Europe and their families. Specifically, it influenced adoption of the right to flexible working alongside anti\-discrimination mechanisms for flexible workers **.** Chung’s research shows the value of flexible working in improving work/life balance, without sacrificing performance outcomes. It also points to how flexible working can reinforce traditional gender roles and flexibility stigma. These points were fed in to the development of the EU directive in three ways. First, it enhanced the policy capacity of key European advocacy groups \(European Trades Union Congress, Business Europe, and COFACE/Families Europe – the largest family NGO in Europe representing 58 national organisations\) **\[d\]**. Chung met with all three organisations for regular policy discussions and provided policy briefings. Chung’s ‘forward\-thinking and ability to translate research outcomes into concrete policy recommendations was invaluable to guide European policy debates \[…\] and shaped the \[…\] European Commission’s Directive on Work\-Life Balance’ \(Director, COFACE\) **\[d\]**. Secondly, the European Economic and Social Committee's paper supporting the European Commission's proposal uses Chung’s research to highlight the value of flexible employment rights, while noting potential side effects, including stigma and discrimination **\[e\]**. Thirdly, Chung supported the Gender Unit of DG Justice in delivering the directive and helping member states’ implementation. Her work included meetings with, and presentations for, the European Commission, and participating in organised workshops for government ministries, NGOs, and other stakeholders. Chung’s work is recognised in the European Commission’s 2019 gender equality report **\[f\]**, and the European Parliament’s Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies 2020 Report on encouraging parents to return to work **\[g\]**. 

 Chung’s research influenced the German, Estonian, and South Korean governments’ policy\-making. Her findings and recommendations on potential negative outcomes of flexible working are cited in the German Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs White Paper on the Future of Work \(2016\) **\[h\]**, and presented in a report by Chung for the Estonian government that contributed substantially to their 2018 future of work agenda **\[i\]**. Chung’s stakeholder engagement activities \(see below\) generated meetings with the Korean Parliament concerning the introduction of a four\-day week **\[j\]**. This was based on Chung’s research on the limitations of existing family policy and flexible working measures in addressing work\-/ife balance and gender equality issues in the context of a long\-hours work culture. 

 **Shaping the Agenda and Building Stakeholder Capacity** 

 Chung’s impact activities have not only involved influencing governmental and supranational policy development, but also informing the activities of key stakeholders in lobbying for, and implementing, better flexible working practices. In the UK, this has involved working directly with an extensive range of NGOs and key stakeholders, including Working Families, workingmums, Time Wise, King’s College Global Institute for Women’s Leadership, the Chartered Institute for Personnel Development \(CIPD\), the Chartered Management Institute \(CMI\), and the TUC **\[k\]**. Specific impacts from this work comprise helping the CIPD and CMI to develop their policy stances on flexible working and equality, recognised by Chung being referenced in the CIPD’s ‘Business Case for Flexible Working’ \(2018\), and their ‘Working from Home Report’ \(2020\) **,** as well as the CMI’s White Paper on the gender gap \(2016\-18\) **\[k\]**. Outside of the UK, particular examples of Chung’s stakeholder work and impact include her extensive work with the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions \(KCTU\), which its Director attests led to a ‘huge impact on our policy thinking’ regarding the ‘35 hour a week policy’, and a ‘paradigm change in our campaign \[… on\] gender equality in the labour market’ **\[j\]**. The work with the KCTU was also the catalyst for the aforementioned series of meetings with Korean parliament policy\-makers. In addition, Chung’s work with think tanks and lobbyists in Washington, D.C. led to her research being cited in ‘The Better Work Tool Kit’ of the Better Life Lab \(a top US think tank\) \(2016\) **\[k\]**. In Australia, Chung’s research on how flexible working enhances mothers’ labour market participation has also been used by the Australian Work Family roundtable’s election benchmark document \(2019\) to push the government to expand their current flexible working policy. 

 In summary, through extensive engagement with departments of national governments, the European Union, and other key stakeholders involved in policy development and implementation, Chung has used specific research findings to achieve a significant global impact on flexible working policy and practice, with far\-reaching implications for employers and workers across the world.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our interdisciplinary research on how biomechanics, footwear, and orthotics affect foot health and foot pain has improved clinical practices and standards worldwide with: 

 **New clinical practices:** Improved patient outcomes measurably by introducing plantar pressure, gait, and plantar soft tissue assessment technologies into NHS Trusts. Worked with a private UK clinic and with an Indian NGO, Mobility India, to base new services on our findings. 

 **New guidelines:** Provided impetus and key evidence for new British Association of Prosthetists and Orthotists \(BAPO\) and College of Podiatry guidelines, covering 6m\+ UK service users. Supplied foundational evidence for new global WHO standards. 

 **New practitioner training:** Supplied a wide\-ranging curriculum of Continuing Professional Development for BAPO. Our work is the foundation of in\-house training at the international prosthetics and orthotics manufacturing company, Blatchford Limited. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2004, our interdisciplinary research team at the Centre for Biomechanics and Rehabilitation Technologies \(CBRT\) has worked at the intersection of engineering and health to develop assistive technology and rehabilitation solutions for foot and ankle musculoskeletal conditions. Although patients and clinicians describe foot and ankle assistive devices as alleviating discomfort and symptoms, there was no scientific consensus on these devices’ biomechanical effects. Therefore, we have applied engineering methodologies to health situations to build a clear understanding of how these devices affect clinical outcomes. Our research combines design, material science, and mechanical systems approaches to examine orthoses’ biomechanical effects and responses to external factors. It has three key themes: 

###  Theme 1: Addressing variations in current clinical practice and their influence on foot and ankle kinematics. 

 Our research \[ **3.1; 3.2**\] addresses a global lack of knowledge on assistive devices’ biomechanical effects on patients. By combining engineering methodologies with clinical practice, we established, for the first time, the effect of simple non\-moulded flat insoles on three\-dimensional foot kinematics during normal walking \[ **3.1**\]. We produced further research focused on testing related factors such as casting and practitioner variability, device\-type \(custom\-made orthoses vs. prefabricated orthoses\), and the midsole composition \[ **3.2**\]. Our findings highlighted that patients’ benefits from custom\-made foot orthoses differ due to variations in practitioner knowledge and methods. They underlined the need for a more scientific approach to orthotic and footwear design. 

###  Theme 2: Understanding how footwear choice may impact foot health. 

 Little is known about the link between foot pathologies and everyday footwear choices. We used interdisciplinary methods to investigate these links. Results from our work on young women’s footwear purchases highlighted that they paid significantly less attention to long\-term foot health effects than to activity\-specific needs, style, and their self\-image \[ **3.3**\]. In the work focusing on older people’s choices, our research compared dorsal pressure on and between digits and perceived comfort between off\-the\-shelf medical\-grade shoes and participants’ preferred shoes. Our findings demonstrated that these medical\-grade shoes had benefits over non\-medical\-grade shoes and were a viable alternative to custom\-made prescription footwear \[ **3.4**\]. 

###  Theme 3: Identifying challenges in the NHS provision of Orthotic Services. 

 A 2014 NHS report identified variances in orthotic service provision. In response, our multi\-disciplinary team produced a holistic map of NHS orthotic services provision. The research documented how different service and finance models contribute to a lack of parity in orthotic service provision nationwide. It highlighted large discrepancies in service across NHS Trusts \[ **3.5**\]. It showcased gaps in NHS data capture and identified a need for appropriate processes to monitor orthotic service provision quantity and quality. Similarly, our work on how UK clinicians prepare and use ankle foot orthotic\-footwear combinations highlighted practitioner inexperience with the relevant three\-dimensional gait analysis equipment and a widespread lack of understanding of key principles \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We have generated impacts on health practitioners and services, and on public policy and guidelines. These impacts have benefitted patients, Allied Health Professionals \(AHPs\), and service organisations in the UK and internationally. Many of the impacts follow from the diverse practitioner community we have built through our programme of Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) including our unique MSc Clinical Biomechanics. This course was the first in the UK to offer PG training in musculoskeletal podiatry. It recruits students primarily from AHPs so that it can improve clinical practice and promote new technologies and developments. It consequently has alumni working throughout the NHS, in private practice, and in health services globally. We also use our research to drive CPD through our annual  [Staffordshire Conference on Clinical Biomechanics](https://www.staffs.ac.uk/events/sccb) \(‘SCCB’\). The conference is in its 19<sup>th</sup> year and is attended by over 150 people annually, who are national and international AHPs and scientists. In 2020 it was attended by 364 delegates from 28 countries. It creates discussions and provides training opportunities on clinical practice and state\-of\-the\-art engineering methodologies including imaging techniques, mathematical and numerical modelling, and data visualisation. The conference integrated with our research and teaching, and our alumni are encouraged to return. Together, the MSc and the regular attendees of SCCB have made a community of over 900 people as students and attendees \[ **5.1** p. 2\]. This community has provided multiple pathways to impact in the assessment period. 

###  4. 1. Impacts on Health Practitioners and Professional Services 

 NHS trusts, private clinics, and other foot health organisations have adopted our research. They have implemented new protocols, invested in specialised technologies, and achieved definite improvements in patient outcomes. 

###  4. 1. 1. The NHS 

 We have an influential relationship with the NHS. Over 80% of our Clinical Biomechanics alumni are NHS employees. Their roles include senior, Clinical Lead positions in approximately 15 large acute and community NHS Trusts. Eddison is Clinical Lead for Orthotics Service at the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, seconded to CBRT.  [She is the UK’s first Consultant Orthotist](https://www.staffs.ac.uk/news/2021/03/senior-research-fellow-is-first-consultant-orthotist-in-uk) and leads a team that handles approximately 40 referrals per day and up to 16,000 patients per year. Examples from these three NHS Trusts demonstrate our impact: 

 At **Central and North West London Trust** \(CNWL\), the Clinical Lead for Hillingdon Community Podiatry Service is a 2005 graduate of the MSc Clinical Biomechanics and regularly attends the SCCB. She began to work with CBRT on a clinical audit in 2019 after the 17<sup>th</sup> SCCB. She reports that this collaboration has improved her knowledge and confirms the following changes: 

 **New assessment protocols:** In December 2020, Hillingdon applied our research into plantar pressure and plantar soft tissue assessments to introduce a new in\-shoe pressure measurement system. This system has produced measurable improvements in patient outcomes. The Clinical Lead describes the treatment of a patient who attended Hillingdon ‘ *42 times for redressing of a plantar foot ulcer*’ in 2020. *‘When he was stepped up to the Acute Clinic’*, which uses pressure measurement equipment, ‘ *he was issued with a removable casted shoe to wear. His ulcer healed within 2 weeks’*. As well as reducing healing time, CNWL testify their use of this system improves the *‘clinician’s knowledge and ensures patients are appropriately offloaded’.* 

 In addition, the Clinical Lead describes her collaboration with CBRT leading to improvements in ‘ *operating procedures and protocols*’ in CNWL’s diabetes clinics and MSK Clinical Assessment and Triage services ‘ *through \[her subsequent\] liaison with other managers’*  \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **Improved collaborative practices** resulting in more effective problem solving. Hilingdon Clinical Lead offers a specific example of how the SCCB’s multi\-professional network gave her ‘ *a greater understanding and appreciation of the orthotists’ role*’, which gave her *‘the inspiration and confidence to obtain support from the local Orthotist’* to treat a patient with cerebral palsy \[ **5.2**\]. 

 At **Leeds Trust,** our research has resulted in: 

 **Improved podiatry services for children:**  The Clinical Head of Service, Podiatry and Dental at Leeds Community Healthcare Trust describes seeing ‘ *first\-hand*’ how our research on children’s footwear has ‘ *supported clinicians in providing consensus based advice to parents and carers*’ since 2013. As the Clinical Head writes, the Trust has ‘ *adopted many of the \[research’s\] recommendations in our own health care education and written literature*’. 

 In 2020, we brought our plantar measurement research into Leeds and Blackpool NHS Trusts. As the Clinical Head confirms, the research and its associated training programmes now serve ‘ *a specialist clinical population of 40,000 \[people as patients\] and over 100 podiatrists*’ \[ **5.3**\]. 

 At **Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust** Our work has led to: 

 **Improved Orthotics for Children with Cerebral Palsy**: Eddison’s research into using gait analysis to ‘tune’ Ankle Foot Orthosis Footwear combinations \(‘AFO\-FCs’\) \[ **3.6**\] has improved the mobility of children who suffer cerebral palsy and attend the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. Fine\-tuned AFO\-FCs have decreased patients’ energy expenditure when walking by 33% and have shown measurable improvements in their hip and pelvic function and knee extension. In June 2020, the mother of a teenage patient stated, ‘ *This treatment has enabled him to be active for longer and he has felt less fatigued, which have all helped to give him a better quality of life’*. In the same case, the patient stated the optimised AFO\-FC helped him ‘ *walk heel to toe instead of toe to heel’* and *‘When I first remember wearing a splint,* \[because of the way it looks and how it made me walk\] *I felt different to other people*’ *,* but with a fine\-tuned AFO\-FC, ‘ *I just feel like it’s normal for me*’ \[ **5.4**\]. 

###  4. 1. 2. Podiatry Clinics \(Yorkshire\) Ltd. 

 **Investment in new technologies:** Podiatry Clinics \(Yorkshire\) is a private practice based in Leeds seeing over 400 people as patients per month. It is owned by two ex\-NHS podiatrists who are graduates of the MSc Clinical Biomechanics and have attended the SCCB for every year since its inception. They report ‘ *completing the MSc and the continued relationship with CBRT have continued to help us to expand our knowledge’* and to *‘progress into management positions in the NHS*’. In 2016 they left these positions to establish Podiatry Clinics \(Yorkshire\). Their close relationship with our research has been critical to them establishing Podiatry Clinics \(Yorkshire\) and using new technologies and protocols: ‘ *CBRT’s ongoing research and their annual conference have been a key part of our decisions to invest in and implement these new ways of working. We use their evidence base, and we use their innovative new approaches to plan the new directions that our business takes*’. Consequently, they offer gait analysis, Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy, and in\-house measurement and manufacture of custom orthoses \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **Improved patient care:** The owners used our research to maximise patient benefit in terms of treatment experience and outcomes. Their new technologies ‘ *give us a more detailed, and more confident understanding of our patients’ problems. They have enabled us to reduce patient treatment times \(and therefore patient waiting list times\), reduce patient pain, and to provide effective solutions otherwise unavailable in the Yorkshire region*’ \[ **5.5**\]. 

###  4. 1. 3. Blatchford Limited 

 **Influencing staff training:** Blatchford is an international Prosthetics and Orthotics company with a GBP35,000,000 turnover. The current UK General Manager is a graduate of our 2010 MSc cohort, and routinely attends the SCCB and our CPD events. He has used our research to shape training throughout the company. Between 2015\-2019, he was employed as Blatchford’s National Clinical Lead and responsible for training the company’s clinicians in new developments. He ‘ *was therefore able to use the latest research, that I was informed of through my on\-going engagement with CBRT, to inform others*’ in the UK and in Norway. In 2019, as General Manager he used our research to write ‘ *a bespoke biomechanics training module for our team*’ of over 100 technicians worldwide. Prior to this module, the technician role had no standard formal qualification. ‘ *The new module*’, the General Manager writes, ‘ *addresses this need and is underpinned by CBRT’s research and my attendance at their CPD programmes*’. He has since adapted the training for wider use as ‘ *the Biomechanics module for the Scottish Qualification Authority for technicians that provided a learning bridge for those who wanted to progress to further learning*’ \[ **5.6**\]. 

###  4. 1. 4. Algeos 

 **Contributing to product strategy:** Algeos is an international company that manufactures and distributes orthotics, prostheses, and other rehabilitation products. As the company’s Commercial Director \(‘CD’\) writes, CBRT routinely supplies Algeos ‘ *support and consultancy on potential commercial projects that provide a technical and clinical perspective*’. Since 2015, Algeos has used our research into the efficacy of the Optogait gait analysis system as an evidence base for marketing ‘ *our products*’ *effectiveness for clinical purposes to our existing and prospective customers*’. They report ‘ *We currently have around 60 customers in the UK using Optogait’* and that their ‘ *partner company in Italy \[Microgate\] has used this research to their benefit to aid in selling Optogait*’. In addition, Algeos has used CBRT research into polyurethane constructions of diabetic footwear as an evidence base to develop new products. The CD reports of Algeos using CBRT’s ‘ *work on the PU Diabetic\-related materials which has allowed us to develop our offering for use in Foot Orthotics and Diabetic Footwear*’ \[ **5.7**\]. 

###  4. 1. 5. Mobility India 

 **Shaping remote delivery healthcare:** Mobility India is an NGO headquartered in Bangalore, India. They provide healthcare and advocacy throughout India for people with disabilities and development or rehabilitation needs. Since 2017 we have used our research methodologies and evidence base to help Mobility India redesign its service. In July 2019, Healy collaborated with Mobility India to complete a review of its prosthetic and orthotic service provision. Mobility India then used our research as the foundation of ‘Tele\-AT’, a service for remote delivery of medical care. The NGO’s Academics Director confirms Mobility India ‘ *utilised CBRT’s wide ranging work and their evidence base for using orthotic and prosthetic devices to design and shape our delivery of the “Tele\-AT” telehealth service*’. Mobility India serves India’s Southern, Eastern, and North\-Eastern states, where ‘Tele\-AT’ will reach all who have access to fixed or mobile internet infrastructure but are unable to access institutional healthcare services. As the Academics Director reports, the service has been designed ‘ *to serve additionally a total of around three to four thousand people annually*’ \[ **5.8.a**\]. 

###  4. 2. Impacts on Public Policy, Laws, and Guidelines 

 Our research provides a foundation for practitioner guidelines worldwide. 

###  4. 2. 1. The British Association of Prosthetists and Orthotists \(BAPO\) 

 **Influencing new practitioner guidance:** BAPO is the UK professional body for prosthetists and orthotists. As the Chair writes, BAPO used our research into the quantity, quality, and distribution of UK orthotic service provision ‘ *as one of the key pieces of evidence for the development of our Service Provision Guidance for Prosthetic & Orthotic Services*’ \[ **5.9.a**\]. BAPO is a professional regularity organisation and provides this Guidance to set the standards for NHS services. The Guidance was developed 2019\-2020 and was approved in late 2020. It was published in January 2021 for wider NHS use \[ **5.9.b**\]. The Chair confirms ‘ *the document itself used research evidence from CBRT extensively*’. BAPO expect the Guidance ‘ *will promote equity amongst the services for the wider benefit of over 6 million orthotic users in the UK*’. 

 **Innovative CPD:** In the period 2014\-2016 we used our research to supply BAPO with a CPD curriculum that covered multiple topics including MSK diagnostic processes, critical appraisal skills, diabetic foot health, and gait analysis. These one\-day sessions were attended by over 200 BAPO members, as the Chair reports, and ‘ *received excellent feedback and made a substantial impact on professional practice*’ with ‘ *evidence\-based training toward providing improved outcomes for patients*’. The Chair also highlights Eddison’s research \(2015\-\) on ‘tuning’ AFO\-FCs. Eddison’s publications and presentations, she writes, ‘ *have helped change our thought process on AFO\-FC tuning and the training around that topic area*’ \[ **5.9.a**\]. 

###  4. 2. 2. The College of Podiatry 

 **Contributing to Parliamentary evidence:** The College of Podiatry is the UK’s regulatory body for podiatrists. In 2017 it was called to give evidence to the Petitions Committee’s examination of sexist workplace dress codes that require women to wear high heels. Branthwaite contributed research findings on how high heels affect the foot and lower limb, and helped compose the evidence submission. The College’s Head of Policy and Public Affairs writes ‘ *CBRT’s research formed a part of key references within the College of Podiatry’s submission*’ \[ **5.10.a**\]. The submission was published in a Parliamentary report \(January 2017\) and included in the Government’s response on the issue \[ **5.10.b** pp. 8; 10\-11\]. 

 **Influencing practitioner guidance on children’s podiatry:** As confirmed by the  Head of Policy and Public Affairs, members and alumni of CBRT play a significant role in  the College’s Paediatric Podiatry Special Advisory Group \(PSAG\) \[ **5.10.a**\]. PSAG developed the College’s clinical framework for paediatric podiatry in 2019, which was edited by Davies \[ **5.10.c**\].  This framework helped standardise UK paediatric podiatry services. When trialled at Leeds NHS Trust, the framework improved structure, body function, and pain reduction in 71% of cases and maintained these factors in a further 21% of cases **\[5.10.a\]**. 

 In 2018 Branthwaite contributed to PSAG’s submission to the Scottish Government’s Health and Social Care Directorate on suitable footwear for schoolchildren. The Head of Policy and Public Affairs writes ‘ *The research around flexibility of a school shoe completed by Nina Davies and Dr Branthwaite was pivotal to this evidenced based document that was also easily accessible to the public in non\-jargonistic language*’ and that this submission ‘ *enabled us to push forward our agendas with the Scottish Government*’. Branthwaite and Davies have since developed multiple briefing papers the College has used in discussions with the Scottish Government and with UK quangos including Public Health England and the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance \[ **5.10.a**\]. 

###  4. 2. 3. The World Health Organisation \(WHO\) 

 **Contributing to new global standards:** Following our work on NHS provision, in 2015 the WHO mandated us to complete a formal Systematic Review of the evidence base concerning orthotics use and provision. The work was joint\-funded by the WHO, the International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics \(ISPO\), and USAID. The WHO used our Review as a component of the worldwide Standards for Prosthetics and Orthotics provision \[ **5.8.b**\]. These Standards call for the integration of prosthetics and orthotics services into the given country’s main health system and require these services to be responsive to each individual’s personal and environmental needs. The Standards are being implemented in all 195 member countries, helping them to fulfil their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A member of the WHO’s Standards Development Group for Prosthetics and Orthotics reports that ‘ *CBRT’s work has been pivotal in these developments*’ \[ **5.8.a**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Much of the contemporary analysis of Cuba is framed within an anachronistic and reductive paradigm inherited from the Cold War and the Cuban Revolution. As countries around the world seek to understand and interact with Cuba in the context of a rapidly changing global geopolitics, it is crucial that this framework of interpretation is nuanced and updated. Research by Kapcia has influenced national policy formation and improved the intelligence base on Cuba for the media. The research has informed and shaped UK government policy towards Cuba through a long\-term advisory relationship between Kapcia and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\). It has also influenced the decision\-making \[Redacted text\] foreign ministry regarding its policies guiding the country’s relationship with Cuba. Kapcia’s research has improved the quality of interpretations of Cuba’s political system and culture in international media discourse, including at Reuters, helping to overcome outmoded misrepresentations of the country’s political system. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Kapcia’s research has provided models to understand the evolution of the Cuban political process \(always known as ‘the Revolution’\) from 1959 until today. While the Revolution’s legacy as a cultural and political phenomenon in the context of the Cold War continues to play a pivotal role in the First World’s perceptions of Cuba, those perceptions are often inaccurate, anachronistic and simplistic. Equally, the Revolution’s allure for the Left around the world has often been shaped by stereotypes. The limited and outdated nature of existing analyses has created a need for research that offers cultural mediation and nuanced political interpretation, which Kapcia has provided through four inter\-related thematic research projects. 

 Building on his earlier path\-breaking work on the role and nature of **ideology** in the Revolution, Kapcia then argued \( **2**\) that the Revolution’s political trajectory followed a cyclical pattern of crises and debates. This finding revealed the fundamental role of hitherto unseen internal debates which determined the processes of policy formation and which demonstrated that decision\-making was often a complex process of negotiation between various political actors and interests \( **1**\). That model challenged the dominant narrative that the Cuban political system is both personalist and monolithic, operating in an autocratic top\-down manner. Kapcia also showed that the Revolution is best understood as a delayed process of radical nationalist nation\-building rather than being shoe\-horned into perspectives of post\-1945 Communism in the Eastern European and Asian contexts. 

 This research led to work on theorising Cuba’s system, offering the perception of it as a quasi\-corporatist **structure**. This resulted in the formulation of the model of Cuba's three circles of power and decision\-making \( **4**\). Through interviews in Cuba and a re\-reading of primary and secondary sources, Kapcia advanced the thesis that power and decision\-making in Cuba since 1959 has always been distributed among individuals and groups \(below the level of the key leaders\) with various levels of influence inside the circles of power: the historic ‘inner circle’ \(largely the 1956–58 guerrillas\); the larger ‘outer circle’ \(with narrower but still crucial spheres of influence\); and an amorphous and changing ‘intermediate circle’ comprising those individuals moving between the core group and the periphery of influence, depending on timing, current concerns and the external context. The research revealed a remarkable continuity in those players’ power and influence, challenging the dominant narrative that places an exclusive focus on the two Castros and Guevara. Understanding these dynamics provides a key framework for anyone wishing to interact with the Cuban policy\-making process as it challenges Western expectations. 

 Kapcia’s subsequent research as part of a Leverhulme Trust\-funded project \[ **G1**\] addressed the **processes of decision\-making within the world of culture**. The research \( **3**\), based on around 130 interviews with writers, editors, promotors and critics, provided a detailed account and explanation of the evolving systems, structures and processes of cultural policymaking and practice, and produced new insights on the periods that caused problems for writers. It concluded that often those problems had been caused by the absence of mediating structures in the cultural field and the existence of 'fiefdoms' of autonomous and restrictive power, and that a more systematic cultural structure after 1976 created more and not less space. This challenged the dominant cultural\-studies approach to post\-1959 Cuba and brought insights into new areas of decision\-making. The work revealed that cultural policy and cultural practice, particularly literary production, have been fundamental to the post\-1961 processes of political socialisation in Cuba. 

 During a second Leverhulme Trust\-funded project \[ **G2**\], the focus moved away from the capital \(Havana\) to understand the **cultural decision\-making processes** **on the periphery**, taking rural Granma province as a case study. Through extensive interviews and close observation in the field, Kapcia \(with Kumaraswami\) developed a deeper understanding of the contradictions and complexity of the processes of decision\-making and decision\-implementation at the local level. The research revealed that, contrary to previous views, implementation of decision\-making always involved more negotiation than was immediately evident. The local processes proved to be very different from the epicentre of the Revolution in Havana, helping to shape a reassessment of how the distinctiveness of local implementation can be viewed in relation to the capital, and providing a crucial basis for political, charity and business partners wishing to work in Cuba. 

 This led to Kapcia developing the findings about the processes of decision\-making into a theory of the **matrix of power and authority** in Cuba since 1959 \( **6**\). Starting from the premise that the Cuban state is not monolithic, but rather a complex, multi\-layered, quasi\-corporatist matrix, characterised by processes of constant negotiation and structured participation, this research traced the evolution of the state after 1959 and developed a nuanced analysis of the ways in which decision\-making, decision\-influencing and decision\-executing power has operated in Cuba. This research, consisting of interviews, close observation, and reassessment of existing theories, examined forensically the different vertical and horizontal structures of governance, ideological authority \(the Party\), and participation, in order to understand why decisions were taken or might be taken in the future \( **6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Kapcia’s research provides an evidence base to question the misconception of the Cuban leader as the sole decision\-maker in the country’s political process. This misconception impedes relations between Cuba and the outside world and frames Cuba’s reception in popular, media and international policy discourses in anachronistic terms. Through providing beneficiaries with an understanding of the significance of the role of negotiation in the collective decision\-making process, an appreciation of its prolonged, cyclical nature, and skills to identify windows in time appropriate for intervention, Kapcia has enabled a better response to, and representation of, Cuba’s political process. 

 **The UK government through shaping FCO policies towards Cuba** 

 Kapcia’s research, delivered through workshops and briefings, has enriched the knowledge base of policymakers in the UK and in turn informed the UK Government’s diplomatic policies towards Cuba in response to new developments and the execution of these policies. Since 2014, Kapcia has regularly advised the **Foreign & Commonwealth Office** \(FCO\) \(at least once a year\) on recent developments in Cuba and their likely evolution. In turn, these contributions have informed numerous decisions about the United Kingdom’s relationships with Cuba: ‘ *Professor Kapcia has been a regular contributor to the British Government’s assessment of Cuba and Cuban issues, over many years and in different ways*’ \(Americas Group Research Analyst at the FCO, **A**\). 

 Kapcia’s research \( **2, 4, 6**\) shaped the outlook of two new **UK ambassadors to Cuba** \(each with a tenure of 4–5 years\), briefing them in advance of their appointments \[ **A**\]. Kapcia’s work equipped the new ambassadors with the necessary understanding of the Cuban political system’s intricacies to enable them to navigate it successfully, particularly in relation to issues on the agenda when they arrive in Cuba. This is particularly important as high rotation of diplomatic staff between posts, especially at the first and second secretary levels, often causes a loss of expertise. 

 In addition to regular and ambassador briefings, Kapcia has ‘ *given exclusive briefings to groups of FCO officials and to individual senior officials, both to consider Cuba in general terms as well as specific topical developments*’ \[ **A**\], which included the working of the political system, the significance of recent and forthcoming events such as party congresses and elections. These briefings equipped the FCO to respond flexibly to evolving situations and informed confidential FCO initiatives. ‘ *Most recently, on 17<sup>th</sup> March 2020 \(…\) he gave an assessment of the situation in Cuba, including future prospects at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’* \[ **A**\]. This testifies to Kapcia’s instrumental role in maintaining up\-to\-date intelligence on Cuba and his close involvement in informing FCO practice. In the words of Americas Group Research Analyst at FCO, Kapcia’s input *‘is of considerable assistance to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the development of government policy towards Cuba*’ \[ **A**\]. 

 Building on his role as a key source of intelligence for the FCO, Kapcia ‘ *was commissioned to produce a podcast on Cuba for the **FCO Diplomatic Academy**’ \[ **A**\]. This consisted of a 20\-minute training resource on contemporary Cuban politics. The FCO Diplomatic Academy is open to all FCO staff \(currently 12,500\) both in the UK and overseas and ‘ *provides its staff with skills and knowledge needed to represent the UK national interest’*, with Cuba covered under the theme of ‘States and Societies’ \[ **B** pp.1,5\]. The podcast was taken up by the UK ministries, including the Ministry of Defence and Department for International Trade, and ‘ *is now in use with FCO staff seeking to learn more about the affairs of that* *country*’ \[ **A**\]. While in\-person consultations occur at the level of FCO Section and Department Heads, Kapcia’s input into the FCO Diplomatic Academy has served to develop a sustainable and accessible knowledge base regarding Cuba at the FCO. Kapcia’s research provided insights regarding predicted changes to the security and economic situation in Cuba, which would impact on the UK’s national interests in Cuba and the Latin America region. 

 **Informing \[Redacted text\] Government’s relationship with Cuba** 

 \[Redacted text\] 

 **Transforming media discourse about politics in Cuba** 

 UK and US media perceptions of Cuban politics continue to be shaped by decades of Cold War readings of post\-1959 Cuba, the focus on the Revolution and on the figures of Fidel and Raúl Castro. Through frequent media requests to comment on individual events and developments \(four per year on average\), Kapcia has countered outdated visions of Cuba, contributing to dismantling the legacy of Cold War thinking in media discourse on post–1945 communist countries. As a Reuters Correspondent and Financial Times contributor in Cuba testifies, Kapcia ‘ *stands out as a source of information*’, with ‘ *an extraordinary understanding of Cuban culture, daily life, and the self\-narrative of the Cuban Communist Party, the state and people*. *\(…\) His academic rigour provides objective analysis and critical insights on the situations in Cuba’* \[ **E**\]. 

 Approaches based on a Cold War legacy are especially prevalent in US media, with sources mostly drawn from the Cuban American community and Latin American journalists in the US, who represent dominant narratives seeking to confirm western stereotypes of Cuba. Through his research, Kapcia provides an alternative perspective that has empowered the media discourse to move beyond polarising interpretations. Kapcia’s ‘ *standing up to the dominant first world narrative about \[Cuba\]’* with his own interpretation *is ‘important for the journalist profession seeking an unbiased view on events’* \[ **E**\]. 

 Kapcia’s role as an interpretative authority informing media practice and discourse is further confirmed by the continuous flow of requests for contributions. Since 1 January 2014, at least 111 news items in press and on the radio have quoted Kapcia’s work, with an average impression count \(number of times an article is displayed\) of 14 million views per news item, and upwards of 3 billion impressions for the most popular article on easing US sanctions towards Cuba early under the Trump presidency \(MSN.com article, 19 Dec 2014\) \[ **F**\] **.** With at least 54 direct quotations in US media alone \[ **F**\], Kapcia’s intelligence informed the media coverage in 22 countries worldwide: in Europe \(Austria, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, UK\), Asia \(Arab Emirates, China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore\), South and Central America \(Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela\), Canada and South Africa. The channels and media sources include BBC Radio 4, BBC 5 Live, BBC World, BBC World Service, CBS, Radio Sputnik, Al Jazeera, Russia Today, TRT Turkish TV and the Economic Times \[ **F**\]. 

 As Kapcia *‘provides reflection on the interpretation of emerging news stories in journalistic practice’* \[ **E**\], key stories whose interpretation was informed through challenging often stereotypical media questions and polemical press views include: 

 In December 2014, following the unexpected US\-Cuban diplomatic détente, Kapcia’s research on Cuban foreign relations \( **1, 2**\) allowed him to locate this event within recent developments, highlighting the serious limitations of what most observers wrongly saw as the end of the US embargo. His reading proved accurate, given the embargo’s significant strengthening and the increased US pressure on Cuba under Trump, and was featured in 18 countries \[ **F**\]. In November 2016, Fidel Castro’s death led to media enquiries about his historical significance. Kapcia corrected misunderstandings, which had exaggerated the extent of his political control over decision\-making, and signalled probable developments in the future of Cuba’s leadership \( **2, 4, 5, 6**\). Among many shorter interview appearances, Kapcia influenced the interpretation presented in the 2016 *Last Words* obituary programme on BBC Radio 4 \(30 minutes\) on Fidel Castro, highlighting misunderstandings regarding an exclusive emphasis on Castro’s personal power \[ **G**\]. In January 2017, Kapcia focused on the interpretation of worsening US\-Cuban relations after Trump’s accession in the light of the limits to Obama’s détente \( **1, 4, 6**\). Particular influence was felt in Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela, with an interview with Kapcia on Infobea, Venezuela’s leading online news outlet, with a centre\-right outlook reaching over 8 million impressions. Challenging the typically anti\-communist stance of Infobea, the interview prompted the editorial board to question the stereotype of Fidel’s drive for autocratic power and opened up a discussion of the role of the unstable system in his prolonged political position. In the spring of 2018, after Raúl Castro’s retirement and Díaz\-Canel’s election, Kapcia was requested by International Business Times \(US\) and the Express \(UK\) to explain the change, his responses later picked up by other news outlet. Informed by \( **2, 4, 5**\), Kapcia analysed the new leadership and explained Raúl Castro’s continuing role as a party leader till 2021 \[ **F**\]. 

 Kapcia is one of the main media informers on Cuban affairs and has made a mark on the ways in which Cuba has been reported in the media in the last decade. As a journalist reports: *‘I turned to Kapcia for guidance among other \[journalists\], as all these events unfolded and that filtered higher up both in Reuters and the Financial Times, as well as other clients such as ABC News, the Economist, The Washington Post and Clarin, in countless discussions with editors regarding editorial decisions and the interpretation of news on Cuba to their readership. Thus, I do not simply use Kapcia as a talking head for a few quotes in a story, but seek his council in search for perspective on my work’* \[ **E**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Following the 2007 financial crisis, modelling of financial risk became a significant issue in banking and finance. Quantile\-based risk measures are more sensitive to events that happen in the tail end of a distribution – the tail risk. Bayesian methods allow prior knowledge of the process to be incorporated into the analysis. Bayesian quantile regression \(BQR\) was first introduced by Prof Yu and has been available for risk analysis by the millions of users of the statistical software suite SAS since 2009. The SAS software is currently installed at 83,000 business, government and university sites worldwide. BQR has been particularly useful to banks and made available to them through the R and SAS software packages. For instance, the People’s Bank of China were able to increase their investments in individual businesses year\-on\-year because with the BQR model they were more confident about the profit on each investment. In one year alone \(2015\), they used Prof Yu’s model to make decisions on 20,000 business cases worth GBP110,000,000. The China Minsheng Bank believe the use of more reliable risk management systems enabled by BQR has allowed them to provide loans to 2,000 more customers per annum.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Many activities in science, social science, engineering and finance involve comparison such as one method compared to another, new techniques compared to traditional ones, the modelling of relationships between or among factors, and the prediction or forecasting of a future state. Quantiles are points in a distribution that relate to the rank order of values in that distribution. A quantile\-based risk measure is more sensitive to events that happen in the tail of a distribution – the tail risk. For example, Value at Risk has become the standard measure of market risk employed by financial institutions for both internal and regulatory purposes. Despite its conceptual simplicity, its measurement is a very challenging statistical problem and none of the methodologies developed so far give satisfactory solutions. Interpreting Value at Risk as a quantile of future portfolio values conditional on current information moves the focus of attention from the distribution of returns directly to the behaviour of the quantile. Bayesian methods, nowadays widely used in astronomy, economics, marketing, genetics, bioinformatics and social sciences, allow prior knowledge of the relevant data characteristics to be incorporated into the statistical analysis. Prof Yu with his co\-authors first explored quantile regression with Bayesian inference. \(Ref 1, Ref 2\). The model and method became available in SAS in 2007\-2008 \(E5\) and available in R \( [https://cran.r\-project.org/web/packages/Brq/Brq.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Brq/Brq.pdf)\) were discussed in the research paper \(Ref 2\) and research papers \(Ref 3, Ref 4\) respectively. Previously, in 2006, Prof Yu organised the ""Quantile Regression, LMS Method and Robust Statistics in the 21st Century"" EPSRC and ICMS jointly funded workshop, held in Edinburgh, in which participants from leading universities and industries around the world were provided with an overview of the state of research in quantile regression. 

 In 2013, under the support of the NIHR Research Methods Opportunity Funding Scheme \(NIHR\-RMOFS\-2013\-03\-09\) for the project \`Exploring the role of dietary and physical activity behaviours along the BMI distribution: a Bayesian quantile regression approach', Prof Yu then collaborated with health economics researchers to apply quantile regression method for health data analysis.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since the financial crisis, there have been major changes in the regulation of large banks directed at reducing their risk. Measures of regulatory capital have substantially increased; leverage ratios have been reduced; and stress\-testing has sought to further assure safety by raising levels of capital and reducing risk\-taking. In recent years, Value at Risk has become a popular tool in the measurement and management of financial risk. However, there is accumulating evidence that financial time series and return distributions are not well approximated by Gaussian models or normal distributions. In particular, it is frequently found that market returns display negative skewness and excess kurtosis. Extreme realizations of returns can adversely affect the performance of estimation and inference designed for Gaussian conditions; this is particularly true of ARCH and GARCH models whose estimation of variances is very sensitive to large innovations. For this reason, financial risk measurement has recently shifted attention toward the development of more robust estimators of conditional quantiles. Prof Yu’s models and methods are particularly welcomed by the banking sector, and incorporated into SAS for the benefit of their millions of users, because they combined quantile regression and Bayesian inference\-based decision making for risk management. Bank’s profits are generated by offering services to customers and by taking investment risks with the general assumption that the greater the risk, the greater the profit. However, empirical data sometimes contradicts this norm and the relationship between risk and return has proven to be a long\-standing research problem.The People’s Bank of China, which is the central bank of the People's Republic of China responsible for carrying out monetary policy and regulation of financial institutions in mainland China, has identified 2 significant advantages of using the SAS Bayesian Quantile Regression package compared to the methods they used previously. Prof Yu’s model has allowed them to determine the consistency of the risk\-return relationship of their business across all levels of profitability, departing from the more conventional approach of looking at the relationship dynamics between risk and bank performance. This means that every corporate decision that can lead to profits is based on Prof Yu’s model of risk assessment due to its accuracy. In 2015, the People’s Bank of China \[E1\] used Prof Yu’s algorithm to make corporate decisions on 20,000 business cases worth GBP110,000,000. They saw their profits increase by about 12% per annum from 2014 to 2018. This was based on an increase in profits from CNY8,000,000, equivalent to GBP904,431 \(01\-2021\), to CNY18,000,000, equivalent to GBP2,034,163 \(01\-2021\) between 2010 and 2018.  Additionally, the first private bank in China, Minsheng Bank \[E2\], owned mostly by non\-government enterprises, demonstrated Professor Yu’s advanced risk measurement models to its customers recently and as a result of this saw their customer numbers increase by 2,000 per annum from 2016. 

 **Other Impacts** 

 The Chinese governmental authorities hired the Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics to develop user\-friendly software in R and SAS for banks and financial institutions. The Wand Yang Institute is one of the top centres for teaching and research on Economics and Finance in China. Professor Yu’s quantile regression method was included and particularly illustrated. \[E3 and E4\]. SAS recognised that Prof Yu as a leading researcher in Bayesian quantile regression \(BQR\) methods and SAS software ‘has implemented the Bayesian inference and quantile regression methods that were proposed by Dr. Keming Yu and his collaborators…The Bayesian inference methods have been attracting increasing interests within the pharmaceutical industry at various stages of the research, development, manufacturing, and health economic evaluation of new health care interventions.’ \[E4\] 

 In particular, they recognised its high applicability in the medical sector: ‘typical clinical trials for progressive diseases often observe excessive declines in efficacy endpoints due to rapid disease progression including deaths or loss of capability to perform the efficacy assessment.’ Professor Yu’s quantile regression provides ‘robust and power tools for dealing with the issues in clinical trials’ and they have published an example guidance on how to perform Bayesian quantile regression by using SAS/STAT software’s MCMC procedure. \[E5\] This has enabled banks and financial institutions in China to access and use Prof Yu’s algorithm to estimate risk. 

 Prof Yu’s quantile regression method has been coded into the GAUSS Mathematical and Statistical System \[E6\]. The GAUSS Mathematical and Statistical System is a data analysis, mathematical and statistical environment based on the powerful, fast and efficient GAUSS Matrix Programming Language. It has been widely used by scientists, engineers, statisticians, biometricians, econometricians, and financial analysts for more than 30 years.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Statistical methodologies developed at the University of Southampton and led by Professor Dankmar Böhning have refined a diagnostic biomarker test to detect growth hormone \(GH\) misuse. Improvements to the statistical methodology of the original test, particularly for age and gender adjustments, have sustained the confidence and application by the World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\). The improved test is one of only two tests approved by WADA to measure GH misuse and is used in all major sporting events that fall under the governance of the International Athletics Association, from the Olympics to the World Athletics Championships. 

 The test has provided continued reassurance of fairness in sport by ensuring the statistical methodology meets the challenging WADA requirement of a 1 in 10,000 false\-positive rate. Since the test was introduced in 2015, no positive tests \(laboratory adverse analytical findings\) have occurred, despite it being applied on more than 30,000 occasions worldwide in 31 WADA\-accredited laboratories in 103 sporting disciplines. The refined GH test has made a significant contribution towards the goal of GH\-doping\-free sport.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 “Fairness” in competitive sports is a widely accepted paradigm. The International Fair Play Committee defines fairness in the context of the misuse of drugs: “Fair play means not cheating by taking drugs or doping. Anyone who does this ruins the game for everyone else.” Athletes competing with their naturally given resources is widely accepted, whereas the application of stimulating substances to gain advantages in competitions is considered as unfair. This research concentrates on growth hormone \(GH\), which can have advantageous effects in competition if it occurs in elevated levels. The scientific challenge is to separate naturally occurring GH from external injection \(doping\). 

 The current GH test, **GH\-2000**, was developed 1996\-1999 in a multinational project led by Professor Peter Sönksen at St Thomas' Hospital, London. Sönksen became a visiting Professor at Southampton’s Faculty of Medicine in 2002 and established a further project \(GH\-2004\) with Professor Richard Holt \(Medicine\) to validate the GH\-2000 test and achieve robustness against the effects of injury and ethnicity on test results. Subsequently, GH\-2000 was first used at the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, increasing the window of GH detection after administration from around 12\-24 hours to several weeks. Two Russian powerlifters returned a positive test and were disqualified, having never been caught by the previous GH test. 

 The GH\-2000 score combines two assays of GH\-sensitive biomarkers as well as a correction term for age and is given by the generic formula: *GH\-2000 Score = b0 \+ b1 log IGF1 \+ b2 log PIIINP \+ b3/age*, where *b0*, *b1*, *b2*, *b3* are gender\-specific constants, and *IGF1* and *PIIINP* are insulin\-like growth factor\-I \(IGF\-I\) and the amino\-terminal pro\-peptide of type III collagen \(P\-III\-NP\). Each of these are measured by assays and currently, for each biomarker, three different assays are available. In consequence, a variety of GH scores exist for which decision limits need to be determined; these are set by WADA to maintain a **1 in 10,000 false positive rate** which, while seemingly high, is seen as a robust and appropriate level of reliability in situations where legal conflicts with athletes under suspicion of GH misuse arise. 

 For the GH\-2000 test used in the 2012 Games, and for the existing GH test, the decision limits had been developed using a relatively small dataset of 352 serum samples. A successful 2013 appeal to the Court of Arbitration in Sport against a positive result to the existing GH test indicated that the numbers of samples used to develop the test’s decision limits should be increased. In a project supported by Partnership for Clean Competition \(PCC\)  \[ **G1**\], Professor Dankmar Böhning of Southampton’s School of Mathematical Sciences joined Sönksen and Holt in 2013 to lead the statistical modelling and inference to develop decision limits for the GH\-2000 detection methodology based on a much larger dataset. 

 Serum samples were collected for anti\-doping purposes from 859 female athletes and 971 male athletes representing 200 countries and competing in 26 different track and field events at the 2011 World Athletics Championships in Daegu, South Korea.  For his new dataset, GH\-2000 scores were calculated separately for male and female athletes using combinations of 2 different assays for PIIINP and  3 different assays for IGF1; for all these 6 GH scores new decision limits were developed by Böhning and his group \[ **3.1**\], which were then adopted by WADA. 

 With the collection and establishment of an increasingly large database it became apparent that the original score showed a positive age effect in the male athlete population, which could potentially place older male athletes at a disadvantage. Böhning led the development of novel statistical methods to refine the tests that included a much\-needed adjustment for age \[ **3.2, 3.3**\]. 

 In addition, with Professor Wei Liu, Böhning developed exact decision limits in the following sense. Previously, decision limits were developed using an approximation by the normal distribution. In this work decision limits were developed using results from distribution theory which allowed use of the exact t\-distribution, thus avoiding the normal approximation. As a result the decision limits now meet precisely the 1 in 10,000 false\-positive rate required by WADA \[ **3.4**\]. 

 In 2017, with the support of WADA \[ **G2**\], these decision limits were further investigated on the basis of routinely collected growth hormone data from competing athletes by the world\-wide WADA accredited laboratories. The motivation behind this was to see if the decision limits could be confirmed if the biomarker test is applied routinely. Here, the motivation was to see if the decision limits remain stable if recalculated on a big data set. In addition, the intention was to make them more robust and less likely to be challenged legally because of increased numbers of athletes and broader diversity of sporting disciplines. In essence, the previously developed decision limits are currently being reconfirmed with ongoing scientific investigations with the expectation of them being implemented in 2021 \[ **3.5**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 “Diagnosing growth hormone misuse is an important issue in competitive sports. For this we need reliable and valid decision limits which identify growth hormone dopers beyond reasonable doubt. These decision limits cannot be provided without solid statistical work. In recent years, Professor Böhning and his statistical colleagues in Southampton have provided strong and excellent contributions to the development of statistical methodology in the construction of the decision limits for growth hormone misuse… We are very happy to be able to cooperate with Professor Böhning and his colleagues.” – Scientific Director, **World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\)** \[ **5.1**\] 

 The new decision limits based on Böhning’s analysis of the increased dataset were first incorporated into WADA guidelines in July 2015 \[ **5.2**\]. Since then, according to WADA’s 2019 annual report \[ **5.3**\], the refined GH\-2000 test has been used on 30,716 occasions. An annual breakdown is given in Figure 1, demonstrating strong growth in the years of the 2016 Summer and 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, with a peak of 8,755 tests in 2018. The test has been carried out in 31 WADA\-accredited Laboratories including Ankara \(Turkey\), Barcelona \(Spain\), Dresden \(Germany\), Ghent \(Belgium\), Lausanne \(Switzerland\), London \(UK\), Los Angeles \(USA\), Montreal \(Canada\), Oslo \(Norway\), Paris \(France\), Rio de Janeiro \(Brazil\), Rome \(Italy\), Seibersdorf \(Austria\), Stockholm \(Sweden\), Sydney \(Australia\), Salt Lake City \(USA\) and Warsaw \(Poland\). \[ **5.4**\] 



 **Figure 1**: Applications of the biomarker test by year 

 Figure 2 shows the growth in the number of sporting disciplines involved, reaching a peak of 103 in 2019. Clearly there is no limitation of which discipline can be involved other than whether it makes sense to do so \(it would make no sense to apply the test to snooker players, for example\).
 

 **Figure 2**: Number of sport disciplines involved in the application of the biomarker test 

 Since the new decision limits were introduced in 2015 there have been no positive test results. This is a clear indication of the influential effect of the test in preventing GH\-doping. Additionally, the statistical improvements to counteract the positive age effect in males was introduced in 2016, a year of strong growth in use of the test, demonstrating further the effectiveness of Böhning’s work. 

 These refinements have helped to sustain the high level of reliability of this test and its continued use in all world sports subject to the WADA code. Furthermore, the statistical methodology can be applied to other tests, not just GH\-2000. 

 **The Partnership for Clean Competition** in the USA can further attest to the crucial nature of the work at Southampton. This non\-profit organisation was founded in 2008 with a mission to fund scientific research globally which advances knowledge in the anti\-doping sphere and contributes meaningfully to the protection of clean athletes. Its Executive Director stated: “In recent years, Professor Böhning and his statistical colleagues based at the University of Southampton have provided further refinements to the development of statistical methodology in the construction of the decision limits for growth hormone misuse. There have been modifications that have improved the accuracy of this test in relation to gender differences and help to sustain the 1 in 10000 false positive rate required by WADA. Reliable, valid, and scientifically defendable male and female decision limits accurately identify growth hormone dopers to prevent false positives and false negatives in this test. The work of Professor Böhning and colleagues at Southampton have been of the utmost importance to identify the appropriate statistical methods in growth hormone misuse detection.” \[ **5.5**\] 

 The Head of Science and Medicine at **UK Anti\-Doping**, the government\-sponsored organisation responsible for protecting sport in the UK from doping, stated: “Professor Böhning’s contribution might not be as visible \(or possibly as recognised\) as the bioanalytical research that underpins the test, but the statistical refinements made in recent years have been just as critical to its continued use in a sector highly vulnerable to legal challenge and reputational damage.” \[ **5.6**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Richardson’s work with Historic Royal Palaces Agency between 2017 and 2020 was a critical element in the creation of what was intended to be a new visitor experience from April 2020 at Hampton Court Palace, entitled ‘Gold and Glory: Henry VIII and the French King’. This visitor experience was conceived and designed as an exhibition and season of events to be held at Hampton Court Palace from April 2020 to mark the 500th anniversary of Henry VIII's encounter with François I of France, commonly known as ‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’; a meeting that was conceived and organised by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. In consequence of the Covid\-19 epidemic the opening of the visitor experience was postponed until spring 2021. The impact can be seen in three areas.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research that underpins the ‘Gold and Glory: Henry VIII and the French King’ project was undertaken by Professor Glenn Richardson. Richardson has produced pioneering research on the cultural milieu of Henry VIII’s relations with the regime of Francis I of France. This has been disseminated in several publications including his comparative account of Henry VIII, Francis I, and Charles V, which was published in 2002 \( **3.1**\) and in two edited collections, including *The Contending Kingdoms: France and England 1420\-1700* in 2008 \( **3.2**\). 

 Richardson’s work is part of the revival of court studies that has occurred in Tudor history since the mid\-1990s. His contribution has been to recast the debate about the conduct of international relations for an understanding of monarchy, beyond warfare and 19th century notions of ‘diplomacy’. With others, Richardson has investigated the socio\-political and cultural milieu of Renaissance international relations and developed a new model of understanding, particularly in respect of Anglo\-French relations in the reign of Henry VIII. He has demonstrated just how personalised sixteenth\-century international relations were and moved the subject on to consider the presentation of constructed masculinity in those relations, taking Henry VIII and Francis I as subjects/examples. He showed how this was expressed in forms of behaviour and material exchange, showing how ‘diplomacy’ consisted of more than just treaty terms and formal statements of agreement between kings. 

 Richardson explored these themes further in his chapter ‘Gift\-giving at the Field of Cloth of Gold’ in 2013 \( **3.3**\). In the same year he produced *The Field of Cloth of Gold*, about the meeting in 1520 between Henry VIII and Francis I, the first monograph study of this event in 40 years. It was written from a radically different perspective from any previous account \( **3.4**\). 

 This book was followed in 2014 with two published conference papers that explored further the expression of Henry’s masculinity in his personal display to ambassadors and his own court, one of which is cited here \( **3.5**\). While working on the exhibition in 2019\-20, Richardson finalised a monograph on Wolsey, the first academic biography of the cardinal in twenty years \( **3.6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In 2017 Historic Royal Palaces sought Richardson’s help in designing what became the ‘Gold and Glory: Henry VIII and the French King’ exhibition and event season \( **5.1**\). This approach was made in view of the ‘long and valuable relationship’ that Richardson had built up with Historic Royal Palaces as an historic advisor, dating back to 2008 \( **5.1**\). The impetus behind this invitation was ‘a direct consequence of his research expertise and publications’ in this specific area of historical interpretation and the fact that his monograph on the subject \(3.4\) had ‘been an enormously important source of information for us since it was published in 2013 and has, for a long time, informed how we talk to our audiences about the painting’ \( **5.1** and **5.2**\). This invitation from Historic Royal Palaces resulted in ‘a close advisory relationship’ being developed between Historic Royal Palaces and Richardson that lasted to the proposed opening of the exhibition and event season in April 2020 and has continued during the postponement of the event because of the pandemic \( **5.1** and **5.2**\). This relationship resulted in three areas of impact. 

  

 **Formulating and designing ‘Gold and Glory’** 

 Richardson’s expertise has been vital in the process of formulating and designing ‘Gold and Glory’. As the Curator of Historic Buildings puts it, ‘Professor Richardson has provided 

 invaluable support throughout the process and it is his research that underpins the 

 interpretive narrative presented by the exhibition and the associated web and print 

 content’ \( **5.1**\). Indeed, Richardson’s work was an integral part of the work done to build the business case for the ‘resource and financial investment’ that was necessary for this significant exhibition to even take place \( **5.1**\). 

 Richardson’s monograph and research, alongside his direct input was an essential element of the ‘initial and ongoing development of the interpretive content, the choice of objects that 

 we planned to display, and the narrative arc of the exhibition’ \( **5.1**\). Richardson advised on the themes of the exhibition, upon its structure, and on objects that could be used in display. He was integrally involved in ‘reviewing object choices, label texts, and the design language of the exhibition, ensuring that all are accurate and appropriate’ \( **5.1** and **5.3**\). Richardson’s guidance prompted the refurbishment and redesign of interiors at Hampton Court, the alteration of interactive displays, and the design of multimedia elements. The idea was to create an experience that invited visitors to be ‘present’ at the meeting of the two kings in 1520 \( **5.2**\). All of this was critical in the process that created a new and exciting interpretation for visitors to the Tudor palace at Hampton Court Palace. The result of Richardson’s involvement has been to create a new visitor experience that immerses members of the public in an experience of the Tudor court and Renaissance international relations \( **5.1** and **5.2**\). As the Curator of Historic Buildings explains, ‘The exhibition that we have delivered, and that will open in May 2021, is based closely on Richardson’s research and, to a large degree, follows the narrative structure presented in Richardson’s monograph’ \( **5.1**\). 

 Richardson’s advisory role in this exhibition also caused changes in the presentation of Tudor history at Historic Royal Palaces more generally, with increased incorporation of his research on the 1520 event and on the life and career of Cardinal Wolsey into commercial heritage activities. This is intended to lead to an increased public awareness of the Tudor monarchy in general, of the reign of Henry VIII, and the role of Cardinal Wolsey in his reign particularly \( **5.2**\). 

 **Detailed comments upon exhibition text and item descriptions** 

 Richardson wrote/amended text for various exhibits that translated his academic research into publicly available written interpretation, which made his research more accessible to a wider population. The impact of Richardson’s involvement on the aims of the redesign is demonstrated in correspondence with Historic Royal Palaces showing his in\-depth input into the process of design and conceptualisation during the creation and finalisation of the exhibition \( **5.1** and **5.3**\). This impact was enhanced by his granular involvement in the gradual development of the interpretative structures over the course of the project and advice on how the exhibition might be re\-structured in the hope of eventual opening in the spring of 2021 \( **5.1**, **5.4** and **5.5**\). The depth of his involvement can be seen upon every level of discussion, including the individual labelling and description of objects \( **5.6**\). This meant that Richardson’s research had impact upon how Historic Royal Palaces decided upon the final formulations and presentation for the exhibition at all levels; from the conceptualisation of the exhibition itself right down to the minutiae of the interpretive text visitors would read \( **5.1**\). 

 This high level of involvement in the project means that Richardson’s research findings about the operation and structure of the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and the role of Cardinal Wolsey in it, along with how the event worked as meaningful political and cultural occasion in the Tudor period, permeate the design of the ‘Gold and Glory’ exhibition. His involvement in the project means that Historic Royal Palaces have based their finalised version of the visitor experience upon his work, with the aim of presenting visitors with a display that will lead them to revisit their previous assumptions about how international relations worked in early\-modern period \( **5.2**\). 

 **Shaping public perception of the rescheduled event** 

 Originally, Historic Royal Palaces envisaged the exhibition ‘Gold and Glory: Henry VIII and the French King’ and the accompanying media and promotional activities as a means of strengthening the public history offering in 2020 with academic research of a high quality. Unfortunately, as this work was about to presented to the public, the lockdown against COVID\-19 was declared. The consequent postponement of the exhibition has prevented the planned gathering of data on visitor numbers and audience understanding of the exhibit, nevertheless Historic Royal Palaces have stated that the engagement with Richardson’s research is seen as a key element in their longer\-term goal of stabilising income streams from domestic family visitors \( **5.2**\). 

 Richardson had already helped to shape the efforts to augment the public historical impact of the exhibition and has ‘supported and contributed towards the engagement and outreach activities that surround the exhibition’ in various ways during the period of postponement \( **5.1**\). An example of this has been in his recording of a MOOC on the painting called ‘The Field of Cloth of Gold’; for the Historic Royal Palaces. This was originally planned as being a means for Richardson to play a crucial role in the engagement between Historic Royal Palaces and the public attending the events. This will still be the case when the exhibition finally opens \( **5.1**, **5.7** and **5.8**\). 

 During the hiatus produced by the postponement, Richardson has used his expertise to participate in a wide range of online/virtual activity between May and July 2020 for interested public history websites. For example, during the 3 weeks of the Oxford Festival of the Arts in July 2020, he produced 20 short podcasts, one for each day of the Field of Cloth of Gold, using images and describing the key events each day. He also publicised the event in several publications, for *History Today*, BBC *History* Magazine and others \( **5.9**\). ‘Gold and Glory’ is expected to be open in spring 2021 \( **5.1** and **5.2**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken by the mathematics education researchers group within the Mathematics, Science and Health Education research centre \(MSHE\) at the University of Southampton has  substantially contributed to the use of classroom resources and teacher professional development, both in the UK and internationally, with an aim to improve mathematics education worldwide.  MSHE researchers have bridged research and classroom practice in three impactful ways: \(i\) through the creation of two popular Massive Open Online Courses \(MOOCs\) on Asian maths teaching methods, studied by mathematics teachers, policy makers and parents in over 140 countries; \(ii\) through the dissemination of digitised versions of seminal mathematics textbooks for secondary education in the School Mathematics Project 2.0 \(SMP2\); and \(iii\) by influencing policymakers and teacher training through initiatives like ‘Teaching for Mastery’, reaching  50% of primary schools \(in excess of 8,000\) in England.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 MSHE has a strong international background with a global reach, conducting research to improve mathematics education across the world. The research team works closely with teachers, students, curriculum designers and textbook developers to create international communities of interest and practice, leading to improved mathematics classrooms globally. Collectively, our work is in line with recent policy and practical teaching challenges, for example, the emphasis on the use of high\-quality resources, such as textbooks, professional development, and learning from mathematics education in Asian countries, which enable better performance in international largescale assessments. 

 To achieve this aim, the work of MSHE can be grouped into three strands: 

1.  The study of underlying pedagogical and design principles for mathematics classroom resources. 

1.  The design and study of the use of classroom resources, with emphasis on mathematics textbooks and technology, in the context of the curriculum. 

1.  International comparisons on the use of mathematics classroom resources. 

 In line with MSHE’s foci on teacher practice, the curriculum and technologies, *Dr Christian Bokhove’s* research focuses on digital books, curriculum and creation of a community of interest with teachers and curriculum designers to improve students’ learning experience in mathematics education. Upon his arrival, *Bokhove* collaborated with *Professor Lianghuo Fan*, examining the underpinning pedagogical and design principles for mathematics classroom resources \[ **3.1**\]. *Fan* earlier established a conceptual framework to analyse the sources of teachers’ pedagogical knowledge and applied them to investigate how teachers gained their pedagogical knowledge from different sources \[ **3.2**\]. *Fan*’s research also laid a foundation for both mathematics textbook research and development and is widely recognised as a world leading authority on textbook research. *Bokhove* then expanded this line of work \(with support from 2012 to 2017\) from the EU\-funded MC\-Squared project and British Academy\-funded enGasia projects\) towards digital mathematics textbooks. Both projects further supported the creation and use of digital mathematics books, with the enGasia project focusing on learning from Japan and Hong Kong, with regard to the secondary geometry curriculum \[ **3.3**\] and the development of a framework for digital mathematics textbooks \[ **3.4**\]. 

 This framework also informed the work that digitised and disseminated quality secondary mathematics textbooks in the School Mathematics Project 2.0 \(SMP2\). Within one specific part of the mathematics curriculum, *Keith Jones’* research examined the way the geometry component of the curriculum is constructed and taught, and the role teachers play in its interpretation and implementation. In particular, *Jones’* research focuses on the design of the geometry curriculum, the teaching and learning of geometrical reasoning and proof, and the use of digital technologies in geometry education \[ **3.5**\]. In addition, *Jones’* work with two collaborators, underpins section of the book ‘Key Ideas in Teaching Mathematics: Research\-Based Guidance For Ages 9\-19’, for example regarding spatial and geometric reasoning. \[ **3.6**\]. Generating insight in underlying pedagogical and design principles for mathematics classroom resources, *Dr Charis Voutsina’s* research looks at the interplay between different types of knowledge when children engage with mathematical tasks and in particular, the balance between procedural and conceptual knowledge in mathematics. *Voutsina*’s research focuses on children’s early and primary school mathematics learning, especially related to their conceptual development \[ **3.7**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As a result of the underpinning research, MSHE’s projects generate impact at different levels on the use of classroom resources and professional development, both in the UK and internationally. Impacts can be grouped around three main themes. 

 **1. MOOCs for ‘World Class Maths’ impacted on teachers’ practices** 

 Mathematics education researchers in MSHE created two Massive Open Online Courses \(MOOCs\), ‘World Class Maths: Asian Teaching Methods’ and ‘World Class Maths: Asian Teaching Practice’, which drew directly from their research on Asian maths teaching methods. *Bokhove*, *Fan* and *Voutsina* worked with the international publisher MacMillan Education and FutureLearn to design and deliver the series of MOOC courses on Asian maths pedagogy, with targeted learners of mathematics teachers, policy makers and parents from across the world. The courses have made a strong **impact on professional practice** as expressed by individual learner teachers in the course\(s\) \[ **5.1**\]. Of the 12,000\+ people, mostly teachers, from 140\+ countries who started the courses, more than 90% of the survey respondents said they ‘ *gained new knowledge or skills by taking the course*’ and more than 55% ‘have applied what they have learned’. Further qualitative examples of impact are ‘ *Great course, have already begun to implement the bar model*.’, ‘ *I have learnt a lot, I changed some of my teaching practices and added new principles in them. I like the practicality of the principles and believes that they can be applied to while teaching several concepts in math. I am excited to use the others.*’, ‘ *I have already started incorporating CPA and variation theory \[two Asian methods from the courses\] into my maths teaching.*’, ‘ *I have learnt a lot, I changed some of my teaching practices and added new principles in them*’ and ‘ *This course helped me a lot to improve my maths teaching. Obviously, I enjoyed this course a lot*’. More quantitative and qualitative impact is available in the testimonial evidence \[ **5.1**\]. Publisher Macmillan also confirm **“ **concrete impact on teachers and parents across the world and so also on thousands of children who are learning mathematics.**”** \[ **5.2**\] **.** In addition, Macmillan see the courses as an integral part of their Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) that accompany their primary mathematics textbook \[ **5.2**\] **.** 

 **2. Digitised and disseminated School Mathematics Project 2.0 \(SMP2\) textbooks were used by more than 1,240 people** 

 The second impact theme extends MSHE’s commitment to high quality classroom resources. *Bokhove*’s textbook focus of his research has culminated in his most recent work to create a high quality and affordable mathematics textbook series for secondary school\(s\) in the project ‘Towards a School Mathematics Project 2.0’ \(SMP2\). The first step in this ambitious study used materials from the archive of the School Mathematics Project \(SMP\), which recently returned to the University of Southampton. Building on the iconic project in English mathematics education from the 1960s to the 1990s, the classroom materials have been digitised and been made available to mathematics educators through the SMP2 project from April 2019. We have subsequently researched their usage, and since being made available, more than 1,240 people, mainly from the UK, have accessed and consulted the different books more than 36,000 times, emphasising that the **current and potential impact of the new SMP activities on their teaching practices is significant**. Those that acquired the books, including mathematics educators, have reported that the digitised materials were used for a variety of reasons, including instruction, lesson/teaching ideas, additional exercises and home\-schooling \[ **5.3**\]. The aspect of home\-schooling has become especially pertinent and relevant within the post\-February 2020 Covid\-19 context. 

 **3. Impacting mathematics education policy stakeholders** 

 The third impact theme concerns how MSHE brings our insights under the attention and adoption of mathematics education stakeholders such as the Government, teacher training institutions and subject organisations. *Jones*’ research has had a part in **shaping curriculum reform in England, including the statutory equality analysis,** which aimed to assess the impact of new GCSE content in mathematics by reference to the protected characteristics of pupils or students. *Jones*’ book ‘Key Ideas’ was used in the DFE’s Subject content of reformed GCSEs in English and mathematics: equality analysis” \(see Annex B of the document\), published in November 2013 \[ **5.4**\]. *Jones*’ research  also **informed the development of school textbooks and other teaching material,** with publisher Pearson’s KS3 textbooks referred to as being “ *built around a pedagogy based on leading mathematics educational research and best practice from teachers in the UK*” \[ **5.5**\] with the book as ‘general source’. *Jones’* book features as the main item in a list of ""Pedagogy References"" that Pearson publishes for their new KS3 textbooks that are “built around” what is referred to as “leading mathematics educational research” \[ **5.5**\] **.** They are part of their 11\-16 maths 5\-year curriculum. J *ones’* book also appears on the reading lists for numerous UK and international PGCE courses \[ **5.6**\] **.** 

 MSHE members have had impact on national policy as well. *Fan* has served on the Department for Education’s national Working Group \(2015\-2016\) on Planning and Resources Review and his research and expertise **influenced policymaking on reducing workload**. This can be seen in the summary of the DfE’s 2016 report “Eliminating unnecessary workload around planning and teaching resources” \[ **5.7**\], where *Fan*’s textbook contribution is apparent in this quote from the report: “High quality resources, including textbooks, can support teaching, reduce workload by teachers not having to ‘reinvent the wheel’, and ensure high expectations of the content of lessons and conceptual knowledge”. *Voutsina* was invited to contribute to the consultation process for the development of the new National Primary Curriculum for mathematics in England, published in September 2013. On page 99, there is reference to a balance between procedural and conceptual changes in mathematical learning. This has been the focus of *Voutsina’s* published research and the basis for her contribution to the consultation process \[ **5.8**\]. *Voutsina*’s research has directly informed and provided core material for the programmes that the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics \(NCETM\) delivers, with funding from the Department for Education \(DfE\). Influenced by *Voutsina*’s research, the Director for Primary Mathematics NCETM has developed a conceptual, **evidence\-based framework that guides the work of the NCETM with teachers in schools**. The NCETM framework that has been developed on the basis of *Voutsina’s* published research \[ **3.7**\], depicts and emphasises the need for pedagogy that allows the integration and balance between procedural fluency and conceptual knowledge in primary mathematics. The framework has been used in the large\-scale programme that the NCETM delivers for teachers and schools with the following aims: **a\)** to develop primary school teachers’ mathematics pedagogy and support the implementation of policy initiatives such as Teaching for Mastery and **, b\)** to develop collaboration with teachers in China as part of leading the DfE’s England\-China Exchange programme. The initiative ‘Teaching for Mastery’ describes the elements of classroom pedagogy that support the development of deep and adaptable understanding of mathematics. To December 2020, it involved 8000 schools. i.e., 50% of all primary schools in England. *Voutsina*’s research has been **integral to the development of materials used as part of this national initiative, such as the aforementioned conceptual framework** \[ **5.9**\]. In addition to this, *Voutsina*’s paper \[ **3.7**\] is used as “required reading for teachers” engaged in the national, DfE\-funded programme for professional development which is delivered by the NCETM. “Lead teachers \(Mastery Specialists\) report that it is very valuable to have research such as *Voutsina*’s to back up the changes they are making in schools. It brings credibility to their work and motivates others to change.” \[ **5.8, 5.9**\]. This focus on Mastery also is part of the work of Rosalyn Hyde, Principal Teaching Fellow in MSHE, with significant **contributions to numerous ‘Mastery’ developments**, including a AMET/NAMA joint conference in February 2019 and as lead evaluator on two national Collaborative Projects for NCETM: The China\-England exchange programme and the programme for the latest cohort of secondary mastery specialists \[ **5.10**\] **.**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The £11 million Sustainable Advanced Manufacturing \(SAM\) project is a knowledge exchange, research and business support programme underpinned by a diverse body of research produced in Sunderland’s Institute of Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice \(AMAP\). It has enabled manufacturing SMEs in the North East of England to implement product and process development and adopt new technology. Purposively aligning SAM’s scope with the diverse scope of AMAP research has enabled SMEs across the sector to seek research\-based support for a broad range of organisational challenges. The effect \(enhanced productivity through innovation\) is felt by businesses through, for example, improved profitability. SAM has delivered benefits of £2.34 for the regional economy for every £1 of funding.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research undertaken in the Institute of Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice \(AMAP\) underpins the Sustainable Advanced Manufacturing \(SAM\) project. A body of research in three of AMAP’s areas of applied research \(design, supply chain and process, and advanced maintenance\) forms the intellectual backbone of the practical support and advice offered to SMEs through the project. The diversity of the research undertaken has facilitated the strongly adaptive and bespoke, solution\-focussed approach in the SAM project. The rationale behind SAM is directly informed by prior knowledge exchange projects such as **Digital Factory** \(2003\-13\), which brought research to bear in training over 6,500 manufacturing employees and consultancy for hundreds of business; and **Engineering Fellows** \(2003\-6\), which developed and embedded research cultures in regional industry by engaging senior industrialists in PhD programmes within their own companies. The body of work that underpins the SAM project and its impact reflects a long\-term programme of research in Engineering; consequently, only a small sample of exemplar outputs and grants from each area are described.

 Design research at Sunderland has a broad scope, including work on material, product and system design. SAM participants benefit particularly from the Unit’s research on computational modelling and simulation in design. Exemplar projects include: 

-  Research led by Elmarakbi to model the behaviour of new graphene\-based materials used in fabrication of nanocomposites **\[R1\]**. It demonstrated that car bumpers produced with graphene\-enhanced composite materials had 40% higher specific energy absorption than traditional composite materials, and has greater stability. A method for forming graphene nanoplatelets was patented. 

-  The Eco2Trans project, which aimed to increase efficiency and range of electric vehicles. Computer simulation and rig\-based prototype modelling demonstrated that it is possible to improve overall energy consumption levels by around 5 to 12% by using a variable ratio gearbox within an electric vehicle **\[R2\]** 

 **Supply chain and process** 

 AMAP research on manufacturing processes and \(primarily automotive\) supply chains has created an evidence base used in the SAM project to increase output, reduce waste and enhance profit margins in participating SMEs. Research on virtual and augmented reality \(VR and AR\) has had particular application in designing new manufacturing, on\-boarding, auditing and customer acquisition processes. Exemplar projects include: 

-  OPTFEST redesigned modern maintenance technologies and practices from the aerospace and other industry sectors to improve the profitability of the engineering parts of the food processing sector **\[R3\]**. 

-  Work by Dixon et al. \(2017\) revealed inconsistencies in maintenance practice in the automotive supply chain, and how such inconsistency links with organisational cultural development. It resulted in a conceptual tool that guides manufacturers in the automotive supply chain towards a better understanding of how it can best monitor, develop and enrich its own maintenance strategy **\[R4\]**. 

-  AMAP research explores the use of augmented and virtual reality \(AR and VR\) in manufacturing settings. Haddad and Baglee conclude that AR could have a critical  role in knowledge transformation and knowledge transfer **\[R5\]**. 

 **Predictive maintenance** 

 Research on predictive maintenance led by Baglee examines the effect of innovation in maintenance systems, strategies and technology, and the barriers to adopting such innovation. This research has enhanced how participating SMEs approach maintenance. 

-  DYNAMITE resulted in an infrastructure for mobile monitoring technology and created new for\-decision systems incorporating sensors and algorithms. The key features include wireless telemetry, intelligent local history in smart tags, and on\-line instrumentation. A novel method AIMMS \(Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Maintenance System\) was developed to identify factors influencing the implementation of modern maintenance practices, and enable organisations to devise an overall maintenance strategy **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In early 2018, Sunderland’s School of Engineering, in collaboration with the European Regional Development Fund \(ERDF\), launched the Sustainable Advanced Manufacturing project \(SAM\). This pioneering knowledge exchange, research and business support project leverages the Institute of Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice’s \(AMAP\) industry\-facing applied research portfolio and expertise in the service of the regional manufacturing sector. It enables SMEs in the manufacturing supply chain to implement product and process development and adopt new technology, and make sound capital investment decisions. The resulting enhanced productivity through innovation benefits both the SMEs involved and the regional economy. To date the project has received £10.9m in funding. Its continued success is reflected in a recent decision by the Ministry of Housing and Local Communities to extend the project to 2023. 

 SAM was born out of AMAP’s successful and diverse research and knowledge exchange projects, including Engineering Fellows and Digital Factory. Research\-based expertise in design, supply chain and process, and predictive maintenance underpins the work undertaken with small and medium sized enterprises \(SMEs\) to address organisational challenges. It also informs the design and content of SAM’s micro\-factories where SMEs can visualise and test innovative technologies and processes. The project’s leadership and technical staff include University research staff **O’Brien** \(Director of AMAP, SAM Technical Lead and SAM Grant Panel member\) **Baglee** \(Head of Engineering, SAM Steering Committee member and SAM Grant Panel member\), **Morris** \(Lecturer and AMAP Operations Manager, and SAM Senior Manufacturing Specialist\) and **Mehrabi** \(Associate Professor of Engineering and SAM Research Lead\). The SAM Technical Team, comprising specialist researchers and technical staff at the University, work with SMEs to address organisational challenges In aligning the scope of the project with the \(diverse\) scope of AMAP’s research, SAM enables SMEs across the manufacturing sector to access research\-derived support to address a broad range of organisational challenges. 

 <ins> **Impact on</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>North East</ins> <ins>region**</ins> 

 The North East has lowest level of expenditure on R&D of any English region and performs poorly on all principal innovation metrics. There has been underinvestment by the private sector and capability failures where companies lack the skills, resources or other capacities to exploit innovation opportunities **\[S1\].** Sunderland City Council *“are acutely aware that economic challenges can make companies reticent to invest in the resources, such as staff and equipment, which are necessary for sustainability. Partnerships with research organisations can remove some of these barriers and give SMEs access to knowledge, equipment and facilities that are essential for innovation and their own sustainability”* **\[S2\].** 

 An external assessment of the SAM project **\[S1\]** carried out in October 2020 at the request of ERDF shows that it has achieved this goal, with **significant benefit to the regional economy**. The assessment directly attributes 198 FTE new jobs, additional £20m in sales turnover and £6.6m Gross Value Added to the SAM project. Productivity, measured by Output per Hour \(OpH\), increased following SAM support by an average of 9.1% to £64.43 \(based on participant self\-reporting\), compared to a sector\-level average of £39.25 across the UK and £36.45 at the North East level \(according to the Office for National Statistics’ 2018 OpH data for the manufacturing sector\). **The assessment concluded that for each £1 of funding, SAM delivered benefits of £2.34 for the regional economy.** 

 The project **supports the strategic development goals of both the City of Sunderland and the wider North East region**. The Business Growth Director of the North East LEP says: “ *The North East LEP has identified advanced manufacturing as one of four areas of strategic importance, where our assets and capabilities have strong opportunity for growth. The SAM project aligns with and supports these growth ambitions **. It is a critical activity underpinning our commitment to supporting businesses to capitalise on local research and innovation capability**… SAM provides technology expertise that encourages SMEs to explore new ways of working, and then financial grant support to de\-risk their take\-up of these technologies. **As a bridge between academia and industry, this is highly effective in enabling research to become commercialized**. The project, built on the foundations of the University of Sunderland’s excellent research in advanced manufacturing, has confirmed the role of the University in strengthening the regional economy and in removing barriers to innovation*” **\[S3\]**. 

 The Chief Executive of Sunderland City Council acknowledges the project’s relevance to the City Plan, adding: “ **The University’s research on advanced manufacturing provides the foundations of the SAM project, and underpins its contribution to economic growth in the city and wider region**… Advanced manufacturing is a key part of the local economy, and its sustainability and growth are critical… **The importance of this cannot be over\-estimated and has been increased as we seek to adapt to the wider challenges and opportunities of a post\-Covid post\-EU Exit economy**… The SAM project is an exemplar mechanism for enabling these partnerships and is a success because … the University of Sunderland undertakes applied research that is informed by industry needs. The industry\-facing nature of their research also brings credibility to the project – essential for demonstrating to SMEs the value of engaging with the project”* **\[S2\].** 

 **Impact on participating SMEs** 

 SMEs can lack the expertise, resources and space to embrace productivity\-enhancing innovation. The SAM project was designed to address these challenges by giving SMEs access to knowledge and facilities arising from the UoA’s rich history of academic research, innovation and industry partnerships. SMEs benefit from four strands of support: 

-  Knowledge exchange projects of up to 15 days with the SAM Technical Team, working with deliberate focus on areas where there is both a specific advanced manufacturing need, and knowledge within the team and complementary University academic staff to address it. Since the project launch, **253** **SMEs have received 6,379 hours of bespoke, solutions\-focussed support \[S4\].** 

-  Grants of up to £50,000 to support the growth of new products and processes. The grant fund operates as an extension to Technical Team support which must have been received prior to applying for a grant. This ensures that the funding enables real and meaningful changes identified by the team as appropriate and realistic, and not simply allocating grants to fund ‘nice to have’ capital equipment. The UoA’s research, in underpinning advice to SMEs and funding decisions, ensures that every penny in grant money delivers impact. **46 SMEs have received grants totalling £1.13m. \[S4\]** 

-  Access to industry\-leading technology and equipment in five micro\-factories, including VR and AR software, a two\-material 3D printer, Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence measuring equipment, and a robotic welding cell. The design of the micro\-factories and the selection of equipment drew on knowledge of the state of the art and future trends in Industry 4.0 gained through applied research, and the facilities allow SMEs to visualise and test the advice they receive from the Technical Team before adopting it in their business. Approximately 150 SMEs have accessed this opportunity, and **71% of those who participated in the external assessment said it enabled them to decide whether or not to make a capital investment**. 57% of SME respondents did invest in kit as a result, and 43% said it enabled them to decide against investing **\[S1\]**. 

-  Research and development undertaken by SAM research fellows in response to specific SME requirements. **20 SMEs** have benefitted from this support **\[S4\].** 

 The project has supported **253 SMEs in the North East Local Economic Partnership region** \(County Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Sunderland\); 68% in developed areas, and 32% in transitional areas **\[S4\].** 

 The external assessor’s survey of all participating SMEs asked about the business outcomes of their participation in SAM. Of the 40 responding SMEs \(16% of SAM participants\) 56% reported **improved technical capability or understanding**; 44% have **introduced new or significantly improved products**; 41% reported **improved productivity**; and 37% have **introduced new or significantly improved processes**. In addition, over a third of respondents reported **increased production volume** and **improved product quality,** and more than a quarter counted a lasting relationship with the University of Sunderland, increased profit, improved efficiency, improved design capability, and implementation of new production technology among key benefits **\[S1\].** Clearly, AMAP’s applied research, made accessible through the SAM project, has resulted in improvements in key business performance metrics. 

 **SAM successfully boosted Technology Readiness Levels \(TLR\), with 65% of SMEs reporting an improved TRL after participation.** The average increase in TRL across respondents was 2 points on the scale, indicating that SAM has helped SMEs to move products closer to market. The greatest increase in TRL was one SME that went from TRL 2 to TRL 9 over the course of their participation, indicating their product is now at market **\[S1\]**. 

 Each SAM intervention is tailored and unique, but the following examples give a flavour of how the benefits enjoyed by participating SMEs derive from research. 

 **Funky Chunky Furniture** make standard and bespoke solid wood products. Its business was growing but the company was not ready for the high disruption and additional cost of relocating to new premises. In June 2019 SAM introduced the company to software integrated workflow along with metrics relating to sequence, frequency and time in all the pertinent steps. Inefficiencies in process were established, lean and efficient designs explored and suggestions for improved layouts established **\[S1\]**. **By July 2020, the company had experienced growth of approximately 30% \(approx. £36k net profit\) within their existing premises, with no increase in headcount or overheads** **\[S5\].** 

 Fabrication and machining group **Dyer Engineering Ltd** used SAM support to produce a suite of fully functioning, interactive ‘virtual site tours’ and 3D scans with a wide range of information relating to capability, process, and live performance data. These are available both on standard screen displays, viewable through a web browser and also as a VR walk\-through. **The virtual technology has been particularly valuable in customer acquisition and onboarding new employees in times of social distancing and has saved time and money in asset tracking and site surveys for the installation of new equipment.** Its adoption makes Dyer stand out from competitors as an early adopter and innovator **\[S6\]**. 

 SAM advice enabled hygiene solutions manufacturer **AGMA Ltd** to meet the exploding demand for its sanitisers and hand gels linked to COVID\-19. SAM expertise helped them identify areas of the business that could be improved through automation and invest in the machinery required to automate the process, safeguarding 30 jobs while increasing output, reducing lead\-times and increasing sales. AGMA’s Finance Director says “ *This would not have been possible had it not been for the support we received from the SAM Project*… **This support has allowed us to tap into R&D expertise, previously out of reach, and invest in state\-of\-the\-art machinery that will help us compete for years to come**”** **\[S7\].** 

 **DLAW Contractors**, a relatively new company which manufactures renewable energy solutions, was supported by the SAM project to both identify the machinery it needed in order to improve its manufacturing processes and with grant funding towards its purchase. **This support helped the company to go on to win its largest and most valuable order to date to the value of approximately £300,000 \[S2\].**

#  1.Summary of the impact 

 Population and economic growth are placing increased demands on water distribution networks \(WDN\) in developed and developing countries. To maintain performance, more proactive – “smart” data\-driven – management of this critical infrastructure is required. The University of Manchester research has played a critical role in moving the industry toward this goal. This research enabled hardware specifically designed for extensive monitoring of water quality \(e.g. turbidity, disinfection\) to be developed and, subsequently, new methods to turn the produced data into knowledge. This resulted in 

-  commercialisation and licensing of the unique hardware \- HydraClam®; ChloroClam® \- bringing direct revenue of more than GBP3,650,000; 

-  additional sales of at least GBP9,200,000 through establishing a new global market for the network wide instrumentation; 

-  providing a means for water distribution companies to transition to smart\-water management; and 

-  enabling reliable water monitoring in ‘fragile’ WDNs, such as refugee camps.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research from The University of Manchester \(UoM\) into water quality monitoring in the environment has been co\-produced with Salamander Ltd, a spinout company formed, and owned by Boult \(since 1996\). This relationship resulted in a progressive sequence of research, moving from the natural environment to the engineered environment of water distribution networks driven by the commercial imperatives of Salamander Ltd. These include: 

1.  *Research on instrumentation for high resolution monitoring in WDN:* 

 Underpinning research at UoM included hydrogeochemical investigations, which were distinguished by the efforts to be relevant to real \(field\) systems and, therefore, required field monitoring to set samples and processes into context \[1\]. This demonstrated that; \(i\) water quality was highly variable in the field and so management required measurement at higher spatio\-temporal resolution, and \(ii\) existing monitoring equipment was inadequate for extensive use in the field. UoM developed custom hardware to address this need, which was commercialised through Salamander Ltd. In 2003 the research instrumentation evolved into HydraClam® \(measuring turbidity – Figure 1\) and ChloroClam® \(measuring chlorine concentration\). These patented products for monitoring water quality in water distribution networks \(WDN\), were licensed to Siemens. Research activity tested instruments in difficult environments to make iterative developments of the hardware \[1, 2\]. This demonstrated that the data was more important than the hardware, consequently research was necessary to develop an appropriate telemetry system. 



 Figure 1. The HydraClam instrumentation, as an example of the Clam hardware 

1.  *Research on wireless sensor networks that function in challenging environments:* 

 In order to develop an appropriate telemetry system, research projects were undertaken between UoM, Salamander, and BT plc through several Technology Strategy Board, NERC Small Business Research Initiative \(SBRI\), and EPSRC/BBSRC projects, including a CASE PhD studentship. The research included testing wireless sensor network telemetry in an offshore environment, in order to optimise use of hardware resources such as battery and bandwidth \[2\]. This research facilitated commercial development of a machine\-to\-machine \(M2M\) telemetry system that enabled the high\-resolution monitoring of HydraClam® available in real\-time; a critical requirement for proactive \(smart\) WDN management. Large volumes of data were collected once this was made possible, and it became apparent that further research was required to turn data into knowledge \(see below\). 

1.  *Research to demonstrate the utility of high\-resolution real\-time data in managing a Water Distribution Network \(WDN\):* 

 From 2009, the research focus shifted from hardware development towards turning WDN quality data into knowledge for operational management decisions. Specifically, this included the use of a mass\-balance approach to predict \(and thus manage\) potable WDNs in relation to discolouration caused by metal oxides. This research demonstrated that high temporal resolution measurements were necessary to fully resolve the relationship between water turbidity \(and hence discolourations\) in a distribution network, hydraulic flow disturbance, and sediment availability \[3\].  UoM research also showed that water quality variation can be used as an ad\-hoc tracer to measure discharge and manage chlorine decay \[4\]. Eight UK Water Services Providers \(WSP\) collaborated in these projects, comprising more than 50% of UK WSPs. 

 Since 2018, further ChloroClam® research projects funded by an EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account \(IAA\) in partnership with Save the Children and Evoqua WT Plc in refugee camps in Iraq and Bangladesh, have also reported that the proportionate benefit of smart monitoring is practicable, and preferable, in “ad\-hoc or fragile” WDNs than in developed countries \[5\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Society depends on WDNs to provide the fundamental need of clean drinking water. Globally, the WDN infrastructure is ageing, deteriorating, and increasingly under pressure from climate change, urbanisation and population growth in developed and developing countries. To address these challenges, and to support the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of increasing access to safe drinking water, WDN infrastructure must become adaptable and resilient whilst avoiding substantial investment costs. To maintain the performance of critical WDN infrastructure, more proactive – “smart” data\-driven – management has become a necessity. Ideally, extensive monitoring and rapid decision\-making can be used to prevent failures rather than retroactively responding to them. 

 The UoM research has been critical in moving the industry toward this goal. Initially the research showed the spatio\-temporal resolution of existing data was insufficient as a reliable representation of the network. This confirmed existing monitoring equipment was neither designed for the specific environmental settings it was used in, nor to function as part of an extensive network. The UoM research initially developed extensive, cost\-effective monitoring instrumentation. Subsequent research addressed the ongoing knowledge constraints, turning the collected data into the required understanding to proactively manage WDNs. 

 **Pathway to impact** 

 Salamander and UoM provided research which brought HydraClam® and ChloroClam® to market in 2003 \[1\]. This research demonstrated the utility of products and embedded technology into industry/regulators through collaborative trials with industry, and workshops \[3,4\]. In parallel with this, the HydraClam® and ChloroClam® instruments evolved into separate sensor packages around a central Clam control telemetry unit. 

 Iterative interaction between Salamander and UoM research has maximised the potential benefit arising from this research by enabling the product to be continually refined, both creating and developing a new market. 

 **Reach and significance of the impact** 

##  Revenue generation from sales and licensing of Clam technology 

 The HydraClam® and ChloroClam® products allow continual monitoring and management of water quality \[A\], and have been sold by Salamander since 2003. Within this current REF period, HydraClam® and ChloroClam® have been licensed \(globally\) to Evoqua plc \(divested from Siemens Water Technologies\), generating royalties of GBP2,000,000 for Salamander \[B\]. HydraClam® and ChloroClam® have become well\-established in the Australia\-Pacific \(APAC\) market: since 2015, sales of 300 units to over 50 water companies has generated approximately AUD3,000,000 revenue \(GBP1,650,000, November 2020\) for Evoqua \[C\]. 

##  Establishment and development of a new market for network instrumentation 

 Through the creation of HydraClam® and ChloroClam®, the underpinning research \[1\-5\] has directly stimulated demand and shaped a new market for network\-wide instrumentation, which “ *only came into existence with the advent of the Clam products and continues to be dominated by their Chloroclam in APAC*” \[C\]. Having established a market for water quality monitoring instrumentation, the ongoing research collaboration between UoM and Salamander highlighted Clam technology could be used to proactively manage the network \[B\]. Salamander confirm that this “ *potentially lucrative market \[by Salamander\] attracted competition, particularly from \[Analytical Technologies Inc\] ATi*” \[B\]. 

 ATi are a globally leading manufacturer and supplier of electrochemical analytical monitoring instrumentation, focused on water quality. In 2020, ATi had a global annual turnover of USD30,000,000, and attributed 37% of their business to the UK market \[D\]. ATi have confirmed that they became aware of the HydraClam® and ChloroClam® products in 2007; and in 2008, invested in developing their own products \(NephNet® and MetriNet®\) \[D\], that follow the unprotected parts of the UoM\-informed Salamander design. Since 2013, ATi have sold 700 Nephnet, 600 Metrinet and 300 Chlornet units in the UK and Australia \[D\], \(at GBP5000, 8000, 3000 respectively\) totalling GBP9,200,000 in sales. This reinforces the increased demand for extensive monitoring in WDN. 

 Since 2019, Salamander and ATi have collaborated on products to jointly benefit from the Clams and ATi sensor solutions \[D\]. ATi’s Executive Director has confirmed that “ *Boult’s research and the Clam products his team have developed, continues to help and without a doubt contributes to \[ATi’s\] ability to produce appropriate water quality instrumentation for \[their\] strategic goal to expand \[their\] market share and increase revenue.”* \[D\]. 

 As of June 2020, ATi have confirmed 50 orders of the new NephNet/Salamander configurations by UK water companies, and that upon annual servicing, the 800 units already in use by UK WSPs will be retrofitted with Salamander Clams \[D\]. ATi have confirmed that “ *the quality and the perception of water quality to the paying customers is now a top priority to most UK water companies”* \[D\]. Further, ATi estimate that UK water companies will invest around GBP7,000,000 in Smart water quality sensors across the seventh Asset Management Period \(AMP7, 2020\-2025\) \[D\]. 

##  Changing working practises of water supply companies – enabling the transition to ‘Smart Water Management’ through data integration and machine learning 

 Clam telemetry has enabled the level of data integration necessary to transition to ‘Smart Water Management’. As confirmed by SafeGroup Automation \(SGA\) – a leading Australian provider of control systems engineering \- “ *the availability of this effective hardware and the high\-resolution data it produces is a critical part of opening up the possibility of more proactive “smart” management”* \[C\]. Specifically, as SGA note, in combination with “ *the design of the Clam telemetry \[which\] will allow it to be easily integrated into the large SCADA systems that SGA manage for large water companies – and potentially other businesses – across APAC*” \[C\]. 

 In early 2018, Siemens UK secured funding to create a new Centre of Competence for accelerating and embedding digitalisation in the water and wastewater sector \[E\]. Through a secure cloud based Internet of Things application, water companies would be able to better meet stringent regulatory targets and manage their network infrastructure more efficiently. In 2018, based on his role in the Clam research \[1,3,4\], Gaffney was appointed onto the Siemens UK team \[E\]. 

 Siemens UK developed MindSphere – an industrial cloud\-based platform for collection, storage and use of data. MindSphere resulted from significant strategic investment by Siemens UK, who have targeted the water industry to be early adopters of this technology MindSphere enables automated data analytics to turn the data \(produced from Clam style telemetry\) into knowledge, operational control and management decisions \[E\]. Siemens UK have confirmed “ *fundamental aspects of the applications targeted at water quality management are based on the underpinning research done at University of Manchester into the use of extensive monitoring*” \[E\]. 

 From inception, Clams and Clamnet® were designed to meet the need for increased spatial and temporal resolution – large numbers of units and large amounts of data – a large number of units cannot physically be readily visited. Also the amount of data and datasets can grow quickly, so uploading and accessing data must be scalable. Siemens UK have selected Clams and Clamnet® to be their favoured remote telemetry unit \(RTU\) to connect sensors to – Clams are currently the only MindSphere\-enabled devices that can be used in low\-cost extensive water quality monitoring and are therefore a fundamental element of these developing solutions \[E\]. In relation to MindSphere, Salamander state that “ *the quality of the input data and the machine learning outputs are direct results of the University \[of Manchester\] research*” \[B\]. Siemens have confirmed that as of July 2020 the first 7 MindSphere enabled Clams were installed with a UK water company as a pilot for a larger programme monitoring clean water service reservoirs \[E\]. Further evidence that Clams are enabling “smart” water management, globally, is the contracted provision for 60 of the latest version of Clams, at an Australian water company serving 1,750,000 customers \[C\]. 

-  **Improving service provision in refugee camps** 

 In 2016, Boult worked with Save the Children – a major international aid and development agency operating in over 100 countries, to demonstrate the utility of extensive monitoring in WDNs in fragile contexts \(refugee camps\) \[5\] \[F\]. Ill\-health consequences of failures in chlorination in these contexts are very high compared to well\-founded WDNs. ChloroClams were deployed in several refugee camps in Iraq, housing 20,000 people \[F\]. The trials demonstrated that monitoring devices that require no infrastructure – such as power and telephone lines – and minimal user input, are capable of operating successfully in these environments, and that these devices provide measurements at a temporal resolution that enables any inadequacies in chlorine dosing regimes to be exposed \[F\]. 

 As a result of these trials, Save the Children have identified further opportunities to use ChloroClam®: ChloroClams® on site at a Bangladeshi camp \(housing approximately 850,000 people\) \[F\].  Further, “ *the potential of this type of monitoring is now being factored in as a tool in future \[Water, Sanitation and Hygiene\] activities at Save the Children*” \[F\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Macfarlane’s research on rediscovering the connection between language and nature influenced the ways in which children and adults connect to the natural world through language. The publication of *Landmarks* \(2015\), which then inspired *The Lost Words* \(2017\), led to mass participation of primary and secondary schools in learning ‘nature literacy’. The adoption of *The Lost Words* in care contexts \(hospitals, dementia treatment, abuse survivor therapy and programmes for refugees\) supported the health and wellbeing of adults. International and UK\-based adaptations of *The Lost Words* in many artistic forms supported creativity, culture, and society and \(through sales\) the economy, especially the publishing and creative industries. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Macfarlane researches the complex issues surrounding the connections between language, landscape, nature, memory, and travel. Macfarlane addresses these both in his scholarship and creative practice. Inspired by research published in *Science* by Cambridge conservationists, Macfarlane studies the ‘loss of knowledge about the natural world to growing isolation from it’, and argues for efforts ‘to re\-establish children’s links with nature if we are to win over the hearts and minds of the next generation’ **\[R1\]**. The award in 2011 of a Philip Leverhulme Prize made it possible for Dr Macfarlane to research and write *Landmarks* **\[R2\]**, a book of cultural history and literary criticism about the relations of language and the natural world. *Landmarks* was published by Penguin in March 2015 and was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Non\-Fiction Award and the Wainwright Prize for Nature Writing. 

 Through the writings of JA Baker, Nan Shepherd, Roger Deakin, Jacquetta Hawes and others, Macfarlane analyses words and their culture with a keen interest in the lexicography of the natural world. *Landmarks* shows that the impoverishment of precise referential landscape\-lexis has occurred across the linguistic terrains of Britain and Ireland, and makes the case for a need \(ethical, even political\) for its replenishment, or ‘re\-wilding’. It argues for the importance of certain practices of nature writing in reactivating place\-sense and place\-responsibility in readers. *Landmarks* seeks to provide a means for such ‘re\-wilding’, by rebuilding confidence in ‘lost words’ by means of eleven glossaries, featuring two thousand terms of ‘landscape\-language’ from more than 33 languages, dialects and sub\-dialects of Britain and Ireland **\[R3\]**. 

 This research into the loss of connectivity with nature then prompted reflection on how children connect with nature. How might practices of ‘naming’ and ‘story\-telling’ enable not only increases in ‘nature literacy’, but also drive positive change in individuals and communities? Might a common language for nature be ‘re\-wilded’ in a manner comparable to large\-scale landscape or ecosystem regeneration, leading to positive outcomes for nature connection and environmental amelioration? To answer these questions, in 2017 Macfarlane initiated a collaboration with artist Jackie Morris on *The Lost Words: A Spell Book* **\[R2\]** *.* In this large\-format book, Macfarlane wrote ‘spell’ poems on the names of twenty species from everyday nature which have been falling from use in the texts read and written by British primary\-school\-age children **.** *The Lost Words* was published in October 2017 and won the CILIP Kate Greenaway Medal for Children’s Illustration and the Children’s Book of the Year at the British Book Awards.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *Landmarks* and *The Lost Words* have helped redress the loss of both ‘nature literacy’ and nature itself in Britain and beyond, especially in relation to childhood. \[text removed for publication\] **\[E1\]**. *The Lost Words* has been translated into Welsh, Dutch, Swedish, German, and French. A Publishing Director of Penguin Books notes ‘The success of both books has been extraordinary – and *The Lost Words* is an ongoing phenomenon unlike any other in the last decade’, \[text removed for publication\] **\[E1\]**. 

 <ins>Economic and creative</ins> <ins>impact</ins> 

 The books have made a cultural and creative impact, with adaptations of *The Lost Words* generating income for artists, organisations, individuals and institutions involved. These include: a flagship BBC Prom concert at the Albert Hall, broadcast live on Radio 3; *Seek Find Speak*, an Arts Council England \(ACE\)\-funded ‘outdoor spoken\-word performance’, performed for over two years; and *Spell Songs*, also ACE\-funded, a folk\-music touring concert and 112 page CD book \(shortlisted for the Beautiful Book Award\) involving 8 artists. In February 2019, four initial performances \(including Birmingham Town Hall, and Queen Elizabeth Hall at the Southbank Centre\) sold out, with an audience of 3,165 **\[E2\]**. The Project Manager notes: ‘Thanks to *Spell Songs*, the artists have taken their music to new audiences…their income has increased due to playing bigger venues... as a result \[they\] are free to create new artistic outputs’ **\[E2\]**. \[text removed for publication\] **\[E2\]**. An exhibition, created in collaboration with Compton Verney Art Gallery for venues across the UK, including the Foundling Museum in London and Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh \(in partnership with the John Muir Trust\), had visitor numbers exceeding 57,000. ‘Essential, gorgeous, thought provoking, full of precious reminders of nature’s treasures’, a visitor noted **\[E3\]**. A *Newsnight* film about *The Lost Words* and nature literacy has since been viewed more than 3,800,000 times across social media platforms **\[E4\]**. *The Lost Words* was described as a ‘cultural phenomenon’ by *The Guardian* \(p 1\) and a ‘revolution’ \(p 27\) by the broadcaster Chris Packham **\[E5\]**. 

 <ins>Impact on e</ins><ins>ducati</ins><ins>on</ins><ins>, NGO</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>childhood</ins> 

 *The Lost Words* has become a catalyst for the outdoor learning and outdoor classrooms movement in the UK, and a turning point in the ‘re\-greening’ of education \(especially in the early years\). In autumn 2017 Jane Beaton, a bus driver from Midlothian, Scotland, read *The Lost Words* and was inspired to raise money to donate a copy to every primary, secondary and special school in Scotland, in order to create greater nature literacy and environmental responsibility in Scotland’s children **\[E5\]** \(pp1\-3\). Beaton raised GBP25,000 ‘to give the book to all 2,681 schools in Scotland’ **\[E5\]** \(p 20\), and within eighteen months completed the distribution, helped by local councils, individual volunteers and NGOs. Her example inspired more than 20 similar campaigns, covering all of Greater London \(c.2,500 schools\), 21 English counties, 3 Welsh counties **\[E5\]** \(pp 5\-24\). A teacher notes: ‘It’s increased confidence and engagement, particularly in reading and speaking in a class setting’ **\[E5\]** \(p 27\). 

 Wild places charity the John Muir Trust has ‘adopted a UK\-wide ambassador\-type role’ for *The Lost Words*, which inspired the Trust to ‘take a fresh look at literacy and nature’ **\[E6\]**. The Trust has built many new initiatives around *The Lost Words* as part of their work, including running training sessions for education practitioners, and working in partnerships with local councils in Scotland to benefit 3,500 pupils in deprived areas. Through collaboration between the John Muir Trust and the Scottish Book Trust, in June 2018, Scotland’s First Minister selected *The Lost Words* as part of her ‘First Minister’s Reading Challenge’ **\[E6\]**. In May 2019 the Department for Education, England, made a video about the impact of *The Lost Words* upon one teacher and her teaching, in order to increase teacher recruitment, part of ‘The Teacher Effect’ campaign **\[E7\]** \(pp 7\-8\). A user notes: ‘I am also working with the library service to promote \#thelostwords through a multi\-agency project as a vehicle to connect families & nature to improve health, well­being & literacy’ **\[E8\]** \(p 9\). 

 *The Lost Words* was adopted in numerous literacy projects and literacy trails around the country, including Bodnant Gardens, Lyme House, and Dunham Massey **\[E6\]**. The National Literacy Trust created *Lost Words* trails in Swindon and Hastings as part of a campaign to ‘tackle intergenerational low literacy in areas of high deprivation’. All primary schools in Swindon were also offered resources to create their own Word Walk. In Swindon \(Summer 2018 and Summer 2019\) 550 families took part, and in Hastings \(Summer 2019\) 290 families participated. In December 2018 the National Literacy Trust invited all Key Stage 2 pupils in Swindon to participate in a Lost Words poetry competition **\[E7\]** \(p 8\). The hashtag TheLostWords generated 520,464 Twitter impressions **\[E6\]** \(p 2\), and 3,504 Instagram posts \(data captured Nov 2019\) **\[E6\]** \(p 2\). Dr Macfarlane’s Twitter feed \(@RobGMacfarlane\) has received on average 9.5 million twitter impressions per month \(data captured May to December 2019\) **\[E8\]** \(pp 24\-30\).

 The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital opened a major new building in 2018; four storeys were decorated with art and poetry from *The Lost Words*, running floor to ceiling as murals / wallpaper, following a major commission by the Hospital Trust. The art was designed in consultation with physical therapists, to help patients move up and down the corridors using balance\-rails as part of their healing work **\[E9\]**. Copies of *The Lost Words* have been donated to publicly managed care homes and ‘Shared Reading Groups’ **\[E9**\] \(p 6\). The book has also been used therapeutically with survivors of domestic abuse, refugee communities, with childhood cancer patients and in Memory Cafes for those living with dementia and related illnesses **\[E9\]** \(p 7\-8\). In 2018 a successful campaign raised money to place a copy of *The Lost Words* in every hospice in Britain \(220 hospices\). A palliative care doctor and author, who organised the campaign, notes: ‘Together, these hospices treat over 100,000 patients a year, meaning *The Lost Words* now has the potential to bring meaning and beauty to thousands of seriously ill patients’ **\[E10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Digital technologies and mixed realities are becoming increasingly prevalent in dance and cultural settings. Gibson’s research at Coventry University used practice\-research methods in conjunction with mixed reality technologies in the *MAN A Collection*, to uncover new ways of perceiving human body movements through virtual and physical artefacts. This research has influenced the curatorial practices of arts and cultural organisations and venues in the UK; changed commercial interventions in the built environment; and helped facilitate engagement with new audience demographics, including new creative activities for children in a clinical setting. The research has been supported through commissions, awards and prizes. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2014, Gibson has developed the *MAN A Collection*, as a multi\-dimensional choreography which opens up new spaces, places, and stages for immersive dance performance through augmented \(AR\) and virtual reality \(VR\). The collection provides novel ways of approaching dance content and digital applications to support engagement and relationships with audiences \(R6\). 

 From 2010 to 2013, Gibson’s research, funded through an AHRC Creative Fellowship \(G1\), investigated performance capture and computer game worlds, to create transformative experiences derived from Skinner Releasing Dance Technique \(SRT\) \(R1\). Gibson conducted a series of one\-to\-one motion capture sessions with 17 dancers to visualise SRT pedagogy. Gibson developed software for an app, *MocApp,* that enabled the dancers to view and analyse their movement data \(R2\). Dance data from G1 was then used by Gibson to create dancer\-avatars to make the *MAN A* *apps* using AR and VR \(R2\). 

 As part of the *Festival of Imagination* in 2014, Selfridges & Co commissioned \(A1\) Gibson to premiere the first *MAN A* performance \- a large\-scale Dazzle print in a display window in the Oxford Street store in London. Gibson developed the print to reflect a real\-world setting that required testing with physical models, enabling a match with AR content and the physical environment. Using the *MAN A* apps \(R2\), passers\-by could access the dancing animations activated by hidden markers in print and co\-create their immersive interactions. 

 Gibson explored new ways of interpreting human body movements through AR, creating a large high contrast performance for the collection as part of Barbican’s *Digital Revolution World Tour* \(2015 to 2019, R1\-3, A5\) and through an arts\-residency at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust \(GOSH\). Gibson worked with GOSH \(2016, A7, R1\-2, R5\) to create 100 miniature sets of *Huff & Puff* cards for the patient wards and two life\-size sculptures for the public waiting areas. Both artefacts enabled visitors to view the dancer\-avatars through the *MAN A* apps. 

 From 2015 to 2018, Gibson explored how VR could enhance viewers’ experience of dance and developed the *MAN A* VR series \(R4\). VR provided an immersive and intimate experience for audiences encouraging the user to become the performer in a virtual environment and discover new ways of interacting with dance performances. This led to Gibson leading the Reality Remix project \(G2\) in 2018 to further examine intersections of VR and AR with dance and digital technologies. 

 Researching how to make movement from a static image and reflect the built environment led to Gibson’s *ExxWhyZee* \(A6\) installation in 2017. Allied London commissioned the installation in the XYZ building in Spinningfields, Manchester to entice new tenants and engage the public with digital dance in a physical space \(A6\). Gibson developed a set of motion\-captured choreographies using axis points in the building while under construction. These dances were then digitally translated into a bespoke version of the *MAN A* app. A large print filled the building’s foyer walls, triggering dancing avatars when visitors entered the building \(R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Gibson’s work on the *MAN A Collection* \(1\) influenced the curatorial practices of arts and cultural organisations and venues in the UK; \(2\) changed commercial interventions in the built environment; and \(3\) facilitated engagement with new audience demographics, including new creative activities for children in a clinical setting. 

1.  The Chief Executive of the Lumen Arts Projects explained that the multifaceted *MAN A Collection* \(R1\-2, A2\-3\) led to a new XR prize category \(S1\). Associate Curator of the Barbican Centre's *Digital Revolution Tour* \(S2\) stated that *MAN A* \(R1\-3, A5\), 'played a crucial role in showing the use of AR and motion capture as cutting edge digital technologies that create avenues for new expression' \(S2\).The *MAN A Collection* has changed how the Barbican Centre approach technologically advanced exhibitions ‘\[the MAN A Collection\] has opened up how the Barbican Centre will curate future works … based directly on the team's experience and success with MAN A' \(S2\). 

 The Creative Manager of the *Festival of Imagination* described how the *MAN A Collection* \(R1\-2, A1\) helped Selfridges & Co to address window display problems, and influenced change in their curatorial practices through the curation of mixed technology art pieces:  'The MAN A window was … an important step in Selfridges & Co’s use of technology in our displays. We also learnt about the curatorial practicalities … of installing this kind of piece in a busy retail environment, which will enable us to display more AR and VR artworks in our store spaces, in the future’ \(S3\). The use of a window store as an AR QR marker was 'a milestone in terms of our window designs at Selfridges & Co' \(S3\). 

1.  Allied London, property developers commissioned MAN A's *ExxWhyZee* for its XYZ building launch \(A6\). *ExxWhyZee* helped create an innovative, digitally endorsed brand for the building. The former Group Property Director at Allied London stated that ' *t*he use of the App in the ExxWhyZee artwork also helped to link the physical, Dazzle prints in the building with digital connectivity and enabled Allied London clients to see the elevational floors of building. This, in turn, helped Allied London to build a brand of developing art in the built environment and create interest from potential clients' \(S4\). *ExxWhyZee* \(A6\) connected physical public art with digital mediums in the built environment that 'sparked new commercial opportunities for Allied London and increased the positive branding of the company'. Subsequently it gave rise to ' the commissioning of new buildings, such as the Enterprise City and Manchester Goods Yard, with the company' \(S4\). This PR coverage created a lot of publicity for Allied London, in local, national and property press and 'helped the company to secure four tenancy contracts \(including NCC, a large computing company and Global Radio\)' \(S4\). 

 The Managing Director of Omni Colour used each *MAN A* piece that the company printed \(R1\-5, A1\-7\) as an exemplar for potential clients leading to further 3D commissions \(S5\), developing their printing and engineering capabilities, and advancing their printing techniques:  'a good example of skills gained in the art world becoming useful in the corporate world’ \(S5\). 

1.  The *MAN A* installation \(R2, A4, S8\) at the UNION Gallery helped facilitate engagement with new audience demographics: ‘the MAN A installation attracted members of the general public to the gallery, who would not typically engage with digital art and the installation attracted a bigger and more diverse audience demographic than any of our previous exhibitions' \(S6\). 

 The research has had impact on audience demographics in other settings. The Head of Arts at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust GOSH\) \(A7, R1\-2, R5\) described Gibson's *Huff & Puff* commission as being 'particularly attractive to children on the autistic spectrum' in helping parent and patients ' to keep \(them\) calm while the pre\-surgery procedures were going on' \(S7\). On viewing the *Huff & Puff* sculptural pieces, a parent remarked. 'I couldn't get my daughter to leave \- as \[she\] was having such a lovely time\! Better than going to a museum\!' \(S7\). The Head of Arts at GOSH described the continued influence of the *Huff & Puff* pieces upon patients: ‘the sculptures …   are still used by patients today' \(S7\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In 2010, University of Bristol research demonstrating the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia \(cooling\) following perinatal asphyxial injury, led to this becoming the standard of care across the developed world. This cooling protocol has had continued impact and remains recommended in updated 2015 international guidelines, which reduces mortality and severe disability from 66% to 51% at both 2 and 7 years of age, as well as reducing the risk of cerebral palsy by 15% and improving motor function scores. Post\-2014, new research improvements to the protocol have been incorporated into national guidelines in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  In the UK alone, an estimated 165 infants per year have improved long\-term outcomes due to these new protocol updates. Health economic analysis supports cost\-effectiveness in both the UK and US, and significant savings to the NHS and UK families in care and compensation costs. Product development support resulted in a new mark stimulating device, now available in 50 countries which holds a leading market share globally.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Severe lack of oxygen to the brain around the time of birth, hypoxic\-ischaemic\-encephalopathy \(HIE\), occurs in 1\-6 per 1,000 term\-born infants. HIE often causes permanent brain injury and leads to cerebral palsy and/or cognitive impairment. Prof Marianne Thoresen pioneered laboratory research revealing that post\-hypoxic cooling reduced brain injury in newborn pigs and rat pups, and followed this with CoolCap, and TOBY \(Total Body Hypothermia\) \[1\] clinical trials, which demonstrated reduced incidence and severity of neurological abnormality in cooled groups. A subsequent meta\-analysis co\-authored by Prof Thoresen, incorporating CoolCap, TOBY and NICHD \(National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\) clinical trials, concluded that for infants with HIE, body and brain cooling to 33\-34°C core temperature is associated with a consistent increase in healthy survival and reduction in death and neurological impairment at 18 months \[2\]. 

 Based on this body of information in 2010, both the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation \(ILCOR\) recommended therapeutic hypothermia \(TH\) for 3 days as the standard of care. In 2014, the University of Bristol was presented with the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher Education and Research for work including Prof Thoresen’s revolutionary research and treatment. 

 Following the TOBY trial, Prof Thoresen established a clinical protocol and maintained a true population\-based cohort of cooling\-treatment and long\-term follow\-up, encompassing 2.6 million people within 1.5 hours drive of Bristol. Subsequent studies and analyses of cooling therapy have focused on developing a detailed and highly consistent protocol to optimise long\-term life chances. In 2013, analysis of cohort data showed that starting cooling early, between 0\-3 hours after birth, compared with after 3\-6 hours, improved motor outcomes for survivors \[3\]. The use of cooling for groups of infants who do not fulfil the standard criteria revealed no difference in complication rates or long\-term outcomes \[4\]. This suggested cooling could be considered for infants with neonatal encephalopathy following postnatal collapse and those with underlying surgical or cardiac conditions, but not for infants with intracerebral bleeds following traumatic deliveries \[4\]. Follow\-up of the 8\-year cohort also revealed 70% lower rates of epilepsy than reported in the clinical cooling trials and suggested that the number of anti\-convulsant drugs needed to stop the seizures was a good outcome predictor \[5\]. 

 More recently, research from the group has focused on how cooled babies develop into children, adolescents and young adults in order to guide future therapy and ensure optimal initial therapy and subsequent support. A study of cooled children from the Bristol cohort without cerebral palsy investigated associations between perinatal factors, 18\-month development scores and motor and cognitive outcomes at school age \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy \(HIE\) is associated with a high risk of death or early neurodevelopmental impairment. Among survivors, cerebral palsy, functional disability, cognitive impairment and epilepsy often presents with increasing severity later in childhood as the brain matures and integrated functions are expected to develop. The cost of these conditions to patients, their families and society is high. 

 As a result of pioneering work by Prof Thoresen \[1, 2\], in 2010 both the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation \(ILCOR\) recommended therapeutic hypothermia for 72 hours \(3 days\) to a core temperature of 33\-34°C as the standard of care following perinatal brain injury. Since this intervention, detailed in a REF2014 impact case study, both initial \[1, 2\] and subsequent improvements to the protocol \[3\-5\], have continued to inform guidance and practice, nationally and internationally. 

#  Continued recommended international standard of care 

 Following the international recommendation in 2010, new clinical trial data has continued to uphold the benefit of therapeutic hypothermia for perinatal brain injury, and studies investigating cooling for longer \(5 days\) or at a lower temperature \(32°C\) have shown no additional benefit. The protocol, *commence with 6h of birth, cool to 33.5*° *C and continue for 72 hours after birth* \(Class IIa, LOE A\) *,* demonstrated clinically \[1\], and corroborated by meta\-analysis \[2\], remains internationally recognized as the only effective intervention in reducing death and disability. The recommendation remains unchanged in the updated 2015 European Resuscitation Council \( *Section 7: Resuscitation and support of transition of babies at birth – Induced hypothermia\)* \[Aii\], American Heart Association \( *Part 13: Neonatal Resuscitation – Induced Therapeutic Hypothermia*\) \[Aiii\], and Japan Resuscitation Council guidelines, endorsed by ILCOR \[Ai\]. 

#  Updates to UK and country specific guidance and practice 

 More recent updates to healthcare guidance continue to cite original studies \[1, 2\], while also reviewing and incorporating new studies \[3\-5\] to inform safe and effective treatment. Updates to healthcare guidance in Canada \(2018\) \[Ci\], Queensland, Australia \(2016\) \[Cii\] and New Zealand \(2019\) \[Ciii\], cite evidence regarding infants who do not fulfil the standard criteria \[4\], and the Canadian Paediatric Society Position Statement \[Ci\], also incorporates evidence on rates of epilepsy \[5\], to recommend monitoring long\-term motor, psycho\-educational, auditory and cognitive outcomes is an important component of care. Prof Thoresen was also lead author of the first European\-wide guidelines \(2018\), for term and near\-term infants suffering HIE \[B\], endorsed by the European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants \(EFCNI\), which brings together 220 healthcare professionals, parent representatives and industry specialists from over 30 countries to harmonise treatment. 

 Prof Thoresen’s research also continues to influence best practice across the UK. Following analysis revealing the benefit of earlier cooling \(<3 hours of age\) for motor outcomes \[3\], this protocol was implemented in Bristol and the South West Neonatal Network. The current Wales \[Di\], North West \[Dii\], and Yorkshire and Humber Neonatal Network guidelines for managing HIE and therapeutic hypothermia, also cite Prof Thoresen’s evidence of improved motor outcomes \[3\] to recommend early cooling – within 3 postnatal hours or *‘as soon as possible’.* 

 In November 2020, The British Association of Perinatal Medicine \(BAPM\) produced a new ‘Framework for Practice’ \[E\], to expand and update the 2010 BAPM Position Statement on Therapeutic Hypothermia. For case selection – eligibility: ‘ *The framework suggests that TH treatment is instigated in babies who meet the criteria outlined in the TOBY study’* \[E\]. In addition, the framework cites Bristol cohort evidence \[4\] suggesting cooling may benefit infants following postnatal collapse \[E\]. Prior to use of therapeutic hypothermia 60% of infants with postnatal collapse experienced very poor outcomes. 

#  Benefit to patient health and wellbeing 

 Therapeutic hypothermia reduces mortality and severe disability by 15% \(66% without cooling; 51% with cooling\). Since becoming the global standard of care in 2010, follow\-up studies and meta\-analyses, including a 2013 Cochrane review, continue to conclude cooling substantially reduces deaths and major disability. In the UK alone approximately 1,100 infants annually are estimated to be treated with therapeutic hypothermia \(0.17% \(occurrence of cooling in Bristol cohort\) of 640,000 deliveries\), which translates to 165 infants per year fewer experiencing poor outcomes. 

 *Fig 1 – Comparison of outcomes in cooled patients from the TOBY trial \[2\] and post\-trial Bristol cohort.* 

In 2014, follow\-up of participants in the TOBY trial showed the brain protection from therapeutic hypothermia continued until school age \(6\-7 years old\), with 17% more children in the cooled group surviving with an IQ score of 85 or above \(100 ± 15 \(mean ± sd\)\) \[F\]. Survivors in the cooled group also had a 15% lower risk of cerebral palsy, a 15% lower risk of moderate or severe disability and better motor function scores compared with the control group \[F\]. Evidence from the Bristol population\-based cohort shows further benefits of very early cooling with only 25% poor outcomes \(Fig 1\) including reduced cerebral palsy \(CP\) severity and epilepsy. 55% of CP children had grade 1 CP and were able to walk without support. Half of them had cognitive outcomes in the normal range \[G\]. 

 A 2019 network meta\-analysis, comparing efficacy and safety of neuroprotective therapies for neonates with HIE and using evidence from fifteen studies \(including Cool Cap and TOBY trials\), showed whole body cooling was the most effective in reducing risk of mortality \[H\]. 

#  Health economic benefit 

 A 2019 comparative assessment of the health care costs, using a follow\-up of survivors in the TOBY trial at 6\-7 years of age, showed the total mean NHS cost per child over a six\-month period was GBP1,005 less in those who underwent cooling \[Ii\]. This translates to a cost saving for the NHS of approximately GBP330,000 per year \(165 infants x GBP2,010 per year\). The study also highlighted the progressively higher cost associated with greater disability, as well as noting that increased carer needs negatively impacted the ability of carers to undertake paid employment. A 2020 US cost\-effectiveness analysis of a theoretical cohort also concluded that cooling is the most cost\-effective intervention in neonates experiencing severe HIE \[Iii\]. 

 The current average NHS financial reserve for claims for cerebral palsy related to birth injury is GBP10 million due to the life\-long care needs and loss of income for carers. Therapeutic hypothermia reduces the risk of cerebral palsy by 15% \[F\] \(an estimated 110 infants a year nationally\). In the Bristol population\-based cohort with very early cooling, the incidence and severity of cerebral palsy is further reduced \(Fig 1\). Therefore, a conservative estimate suggests therapeutic hypothermia saves the NHS over GBP500 million every year. 

#  Development of specialist equipment 

 Long\-term collaboration with Mennen Medical Ltd has enabled Prof Thoresen to be instrumental in the development and trialling of specialist equipment for cooling and brain assessment. Selection of infants with HIE suitable for therapeutic hypothermia is best done using amplitude integrated EEG \(aEEG\) to diagnose depressed brain activity. Prof Thoresen undertook laboratory comparison of a new aEEG device developed by Mennen Medical with the ‘gold standard’ CFM monitor. These data supported the product to gain CE marking and FDA approval \(Dec 2013\) \[J\]. The VP Clinical Manager at Mennen Medical notes that ‘ *Professor Thoresen’s invaluable feedback resulted in a user friendly, robust and improved, 2 channel aEEG machine’.* Furthermore, when the device \(CerebraLogik\) launched \(2014\), the 2\-channel approach was; *‘unique, and stimulated development from competitors as well as driving down the market price. CerebraLogik is now available in 50 countries, has sold to hundreds of institutions and holds a leading market share in a competitive environment.’* \[J\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Manchester \(UoM\) has led the British Election Study \(BES\) since 2013. In so doing, it has supported the functioning of British democracy by: \(1\) improving media coverage of elections, putting academic analysis at its heart; \(2\) embedding research into political polling, thereby placing political polling on a firmer methodological footing and facilitating methodological improvements to polling; and  \(3\) shaping the behaviour of key political actors, enabling better\-informed political decisions through the provision of reliable data to the two main political parties in the UK. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\)\-funded British Election Study has been run at every British election since 1964. Its remit is twofold: first, to gather high\-quality data on British political attitudes and electoral behaviour to facilitate academic and non\-academic political research; second, to conduct and publish original research into British political attitudes and behaviour. The University of Manchester was awarded the British Election Study in 2013 \(i\) and again in 2019 \(ii\). Three research contributions underpin the impact reported in this case study: 

#  1. Collecting gold\-standard data on British voting behaviour and political attitudes 

 The 2014 \- 2020 period has been one of the most tumultuous in British history, with three general elections, two high\-stakes referendums, and many other important electoral events. The British Election Study leadership team \(2014 – 2020\) has designed, implemented, and disseminated data \[1\] consisting of: \(1\) Random probability face\-to\-face surveys covering the 2015, 2017, and 2019 elections; and \(2\) a 20\-wave internet\-panel survey – the largest of its kind ever collected in the UK – covering the 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections, the Scottish independence referendum, the EU referendum, the 2014 and 2019 European Parliament elections, and local and devolved \(combined authority\) elections. Through a rigorous theoretical approach and careful methodological design, the BES team has delivered a uniquely valuable data resource for researchers within and beyond academia, which has been and continues to be more widely used than ever before. 

#  2. Making sense of British politics in flux 

 The general elections of 2015, 2017, and 2019 were among the most volatile in British electoral history. The Manchester BES team’s research has sought to understand why British politics and the British party system has become destabilised \[2, 3, 4\]. Key findings demonstrate how long\-term, gradual changes in voter volatility and the impact of electoral shocks have combined to radically transform the political landscape. The research shows that increased voter volatility is driven, in part, by a weakening of voters’ partisan attachments – a process known as partisan dealignment – together with the growth of smaller parties \(which has led to ‘party system fragmentation’\). 

 Partisan dealignment alone does not explain the results of recent elections. Voters might be more likely to switch parties than in the past but that does not tell us which voters are switching to which parties, and why they are doing so. The team’s findings suggest that to properly understand political change, we need to consider the electoral shocks that have acted as catalysts for large scale vote\-switching in particular directions; specifically, the Global Financial Crisis, recent immigration patterns, the Conservative\-Liberal Democrat coalition, and the Scottish independence and EU referendums. In the main book arising from the BES team’s work \[2\], this evidence is set out and a novel theoretical perspective on the study of elections and electoral behaviour is introduced. 

#  3. Diagnosing polling errors 

 While British voting behaviour was in flux, the 2015 polling miss \(in which the pre\-election polls proved inaccurate\) undermined public confidence in the accuracy of survey research. The BES team, as part of the British Polling Council inquiry into the polling miss, diagnosed the problems with the polls in 2015 and offered potential solutions to fix them \[5, 6\]. The team’s research found limited evidence of systematic voter intention misreporting, late swings, systematically different preferences among the ‘don’t knows’, and differential turnout of parties’ supporters \[5, 6\]. By comparing the BES face\-to\-face probability sample and BES Internet panel \[A\], findings demonstrate that the online survey’s polling error was primarily caused by under\-sampling non\-voters, and then weighting respondents to represent the general population. Consequently, demographic groups with a low probability of voting were overweighted within the voter subsample.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 A well\-functioning democracy requires well\-informed citizens and responsive political parties. The BES team worked to improve media coverage of elections by integrating academic analysis into ITV’s election coverage, engaging with parliamentarians and the wider media. Its input into the British Polling Council’s inquiry into the 2015 polling miss, directly contributed to changes in polling methodologies used by pollsters, and key figures from both main political parties have attested to the impact the BES research has had in supporting the health of British democracy. 

#  1. Improving media coverage of elections by putting academic analysis at its heart 

 Central to the BES team’s role in making a better informed democracy was the collaboration with ITV news, led by Green \(University of Manchester until 2018\) and Prosser. Drawing on the extensive research into British voting behaviour \[1\-4\], Green and Prosser actively shaped ITV’s coverage of the 2015, 2017, and 2019 General Elections, and the 2016 EU Referendum, by putting the research results and analysis at their heart. Traditional television coverage of elections has relied solely on analysis of aggregate level data which can lead to false inferences about the behaviour of individual voters and groups. Green and Prosser introduced a new approach, using survey data collected before and during the election campaign \[1\] to better inform ITV’s audience about voter’s opinions and motivations. Summarising what the BES teams input and data brought to ITV’s elections coverage \(which was nominated for Royal Television Society and BAFTA awards\) the ITV News Editor wrote that this  *“has been central to our election and referendum programmes and provided unique benefits to viewers \- informing them earliest of results \- and crucially, playing a fundamental role in ITV's coverage in explaining results in a clear, compelling and rigorous way and bringing clarity to the most complex issues of our time for viewers around the UK”* \[A\]. 

 The UoM team placed the BES research as a principal voice in understanding the 2015 – 2019 elections and the 2016 referendum through extensive work with a wide range of media channels – informing the public about British elections and public opinion with high\- quality survey data and analysis \[A, B, C, D\] that went beyond the headline polling numbers that dominate media coverage. The team engaged in events before and after the 2015 General Election, the 2016 EU referendum, the 2017 General Election, and the 2019 General Election \(e.g. BES journalist events, Political Studies Association media briefings, the All\-Party Parliamentary Group for Social Science and Policy, three major BBC Parliament events, one\-to\-one meetings with key broadcasters\), and wrote commissioned articles for newspapers and the BBC online \(related to the research in \[2\-4\]\). According to Factiva, in the six years since the Manchester team took over the BES, there was a greater than ten\-fold increase in print media articles mentioning the BES \(2014\-2020\) compared to the previous 6 years \[B\]. 

#  2. Putting political polling on a firmer methodological footing 

 Political polling plays a central role in modern democracy by informing political actors, the media, and citizens about voters’ preferences and opinions. Just as political events cry out for reliable data and greater public understanding, polling misses have undermined public confidence in survey research. BES research led the way in diagnosing the problems with polls in 2015 and identifying methodological improvements \[5, 6\]. As the Secretary of the British Polling Council wrote: *“At a time when the whole concept of sample surveys was called into doubt, the ability of the BES to show that well\-designed and well\-conducted surveys can still represent the population with a high degree of accuracy helped polling organisations both by helping them understand what might have gone wrong and how to avoid similar problems in future”* \[C\]. 

 Drawing on the face\-to\-face survey data, research by Mellon and Prosser \[5\] was the first to suggest that unrepresentative samples were the cause of the 2015 polling miss \[D\], a conclusion later supported by the British Polling Council inquiry into the polling miss \[6\], in which Green took part, and accepted by the polling industry as a whole \[B, C\]. The Manchester team actively sought to inform the public and pollsters as to the reasons for the polling miss. Mellon and Prosser wrote a series of blog posts on the BES website and the influential Monkey Cage \( *Washington Post*\) and actively promoted their findings in the media \(BBC Newsnight, *The Guardian, The Independent*, *Huffington Post*\). They presented at industry and academic conferences, and engaged directly with the heads of research at prominent polling firms, including Pew, YouGov, ICM, TNS, and GQR. 

 The Manchester\-based research has caused leading pollsters to change their methodology. The importance of BES data in underpinning improvements to political polling is visible in its use in providing weighting targets for many polling companies \[E\]. The Head of Methods at Kantar Public wrote, *“The single most important contribution for us was the suggestion of “turnout weighting” in Mellon and Prosser’s paper “Missing Non\-Voters and Misweighted Samples: Explaining the 2015 Great British Polling Miss* \[5\] *”* \[F\]. BES data also plays a key role in new polling innovations, such as YouGov’s MRP \(Multi\-level Regression and Post\-stratification\) model which \(almost alone amongst its competitors\) accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election, in part by using BES data to estimate the likely turnout pattern \[G\]. The Secretary of the British Polling Council wrote *“Individual BPC members have also made extensive use of the BES in conducting their own internal investigations into how they might avoid similar polling errors in future... the BPC as an umbrella body is happy to speak for its members and say that many have found the BES very useful in their own work”* \[C\]. 

 The research and engagement undertaken by the Manchester BES team has been recognised for its role in understanding the polling miss leading to more accurate polling methods adopted by leading pollsters. The BES was a finalist for the 2017 ESRC Celebrating Impact Prize, in the Outstanding Impact in Society category \[H\]. 

#  3. Supporting the health of British democracy through reliable data 

 BES research has impacted on British democracy by providing high\-quality data \[1\] that informs the decision making of key political actors. Prosser and Mellon submitted written evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Political Polling and Digital Media, and Green gave oral evidence, and co\-authored the World Association for Public Opinion Research \(WAPOR\) submission to the same inquiry. The behaviour of the two main political parties in the UK, the Conservatives and Labour, has been shaped by their use of BES data and analysis to understand voter movements, resource allocation during campaigns, and inform post\-election analyses presented to stakeholders. 

 \[Text removed for publication\] \[I\]. 

 Likewise, the General Secretary of the Labour Party, Jennie Formby, wrote, *“Since the current BES scientific leadership group assumed management of the project, we have used BES information in planning and preparing for both the last two general elections”* \[J\] *.* Specifically, she states that the BES research *“has been used to inform Labour’s approach, strategy, and resource allocation in our campaigns… in particular, it has been used: to underpin targeting decisions, drive resource allocation, inform subsequent post\-election reviews, and enrich understanding and discussions of political attitudes, trends and patterns in British elections”* \[J\]. Summarising the importance of the BES, she wrote that the BES “ *has an impact, far beyond the university sector, in ensuring that our democracy is healthy and well\-served by political party activities which reflect the concerns and priorities of the British electorate”* \[J\]. After the 2019 election the Labour Together Review commissioners wrote that BES data, *“was incredibly helpful as our review aimed to understand Labour’s decline in support over a longer period…. Although they were hard to face, our conclusions were evidence\-based and accepted across the party. We are certain that the deep respect for the work of the British Election Study from people across Labour’s political sphere helped us to achieve this”* \[K\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Cambridge academics, including John McCafferty, contributed to the invention of phage display, a revolutionary antibody discovery technology. Using outcomes from the research, Dr McCafferty established the biotechnology company IONTAS, now at the forefront of antibody innovation. The company combines drug discovery services alongside the development of new antibody technologies that enhance and optimise antibody drug discovery, facilitating the development of new medicines. With 32 employees and 2019 assets of GBP 2,377,000, IONTAS is an expanding, recently merged, company that contributes to the economy in the UK and in Portugal, through its parent company, Fairjourney Biologics. The research and technology also created the opportunity to launch a new drug development company, Maxion Therapeutics.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The use of monoclonal antibodies, man\-made proteins that act like human antibodies in the immune system, is rapidly expanding in the world of biotechnology. With their ability to bind with high affinity and specificity to a wide variety of targets, monoclonal antibodies \(mAbs\), have emerged as an important tool in medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology. It is, therefore, necessary to establish cost\-effective methods to discover and generate mAbs at scale. 

 Bacteriophages \(or phage\) are viruses of bacteria that can be used to produce proteins of interest \(PoI\) in large amounts. In the phage display technique, a gene encoding a PoI is inserted into a phage coat protein gene, causing the phage to display the PoI on the outside, while containing the gene for the protein inside, resulting in a connection between genotype and phenotype. The phage can then be amplified through host bacteria that replicate them. This approach can be used with many millions of genes to create libraries of proteins that can be screened in order to detect interaction between the displayed protein and other molecules. 

 Using phage display, antibody fragments can be displayed and presented to different proteins to select for antibodies with specific characteristics. Unlike earlier methods that relied on production in mice, phage display can be used to generate fully human antibodies, reducing the likelihood of the human body identifying the injected antibody as foreign and generating its own immune response. Due to the robust nature and high stability of phages, this technology has gained advantages over the other antibody isolation approaches \(Int J Biol Macromol, 2019, doi:10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.006\). 

  

 The work carried out in the assessment period by Dr John McCafferty and colleagues is centred on the generation of mAbs using phage display. This work was crucial for simplifying and improving many facets of the phage display process and enhancing its commercial viability. In 2007, Dr McCafferty and colleagues showed that by using their technology it was possible to generate a high\-quality antibody display library of over 10 billion clones, which was then used to isolate antibodies to hundreds of targets \[R1\], demonstrating the potential of phage display in genome\-wide mAb generation. However, it was still necessary to overcome some challenges. A common issue with phage display stems from the misfolding of proteins associated with the use of the bacterium *E. coli* to express mammalian proteins. A possible solution was to prepare a library of gene fragments and to select those that express well. In 2008, McCafferty et al. described a new method for preparing a random gene fragment library and selecting for soluble protein expression \[R2\]. Prior to this, methods used to circumvent the problem were laborious and costly, and required a mapped protein domain. The new method was particularly useful since it could be performed without prior knowledge of target protein domain architecture. 

 The success of an antibody in a particular application is dependent on a combination of specificity, affinity, and the properties of the antigen binding site. To generate such antibodies in a scalable fashion, McCafferty and colleagues took part in an international pilot study in 2010, creating a large panel of antibodies to a family of 20 human signalling molecules \[R3\]. They showed that affinity maturation, the process of improving antibody affinity to antigens, could be carried out in parallel on multiple antigens. The resulting antibodies were successfully used to identify interacting partners of a signalling protein \(Shc1\). Following this proof\-of\-concept, to provide a scalable approach for mapping protein interaction networks, it was necessary to increase the availability of antibodies with sufficient affinities. In 2011, McCafferty and colleagues demonstrated such an approach for the generation of suitable antibodies using phage display and affinity maturation \[R4\]. 

 Whilst many commercially available antibodies to human proteins existed, research in the area had been hindered by their inconsistent validation and poor performance. To overcome this, McCafferty and colleagues demonstrated that using phage display, high\-affinity, high\-specificity antibodies could be produced and validated, laying the groundwork for a pipeline for the supply of such antibodies \[R5\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research from Cambridge University on phage display has opened up access to human antibodies in a way that has proved commercially profitable, and revolutionary for the development of antibody therapeutics. 

  

 **Commercial impact** 

 Dr McCafferty founded the company IONTAS to generate human antibody drug leads for client companies using phage display on a fee\-for\-service basis. IONTAS was established in 2012, initially embedded within the Department of Biochemistry at the University with four employees. In the first two years, the company focused on building a reputation for successful delivery of products within Dr McCafferty’s existing network of contacts in the therapeutic antibody discovery community \[E1\], generating profit from the outset and growing a community of repeat customers. As the business grew it relocated to the Babraham Research Park, and again in 2016 to its present\-day location in dedicated premises south of Cambridge, with 7,500 sq. ft of lab and office space \[E2\]. Following an atypical route, IONTAS did not receive external funds from investors, and its growth was solely from revenue generated by the company. By 2020 IONTAS had grown to a team of 32 employees with assets of GBP 2,377,000 \[E3\]. IONTAS’ success was recognised when it was named small business of the year at the Cambridge News Business Excellence Awards in 2019, highlighting its sustained growth and increased market strength whilst remaining profitable \[E4\]. 

 The success of IONTAS is further highlighted by their acquisition in early 2020 by their main competitor, FairJourney Biologics \(Porto, Portugal\), facilitated by investment \[undisclosed amount\] from GHO Capital, a European health care investor. Their collaboration brings together complementary services and technology to enable faster identification of effective antibodies, with an immediate focus on SARS\-CoV\-2 antibodies \[E5\].  FairJourney say that “this junction allows antibodies to be identified without the need for further optimisation thereby reducing the risk of delays during development and subsequent scale to manufacture” \[E5\]. The CEO of FairJourney Biologics said of the collaboration that the two companies “share the same values in offering a premium service with innovative technology. This deal represents an important step in the continued growth and internationalisation of FairJourney” \[E6\]. As part of the transaction with FairJourney, McCafferty has also launched a new drug development company, Maxion Therapeutics, making use of IONTAS’ emerging KnotBody technology \[E5\]. The KnotBody technology is also a product of McCafferty’s research on phage display. 

  

 **Antibody development** 

 Two key lines of work at IONTAS that are revolutionising antibody development are Knotbodies and Mammalian Display Technology. 

  

 <ins>Knotbodies</ins> 

 Using phage display technology, IONTAS has invented a novel antibody format \(“KnotBodies”\) that facilitates the targeting of ion channels: key therapeutic targets which therapeutics had previously struggled to target with the required potency and specificity. The KnotBody format combines the ion channel\-modulating functionality of naturally occurring venom\-derived small peptides called knottins, with the extended half\-life, specificity and in vivo capabilities of monoclonal antibodies \[E7\]. 

  

 <ins>Mammalian Display Technology</ins> 

 IONTAS have developed a proprietary and patented mammalian display system \[E8\], using Dr McCafferty’s research outlined above, i.e. the linkage of antibody genes to the antibodies they encode. However, by using mammalian rather than bacterial cells, the work is done in cell types that are ultimately used for antibody production. As well as allowing for the direct screening of millions of clones, the mammalian display system also has the potential, during the early discovery phase, to identify and avoid clones with biophysical liabilities that can lead to product failure and derailment, such as a propensity to aggregate. This allows the team to “fix” problematic antibodies and, better still, identify them during discovery and avoid them in the first place \[E8\]. FairJourney Biologics CEO highlighted Mammalian Display Technology as being time\-saving and cost\-saving for industry as the process allows developable products to be generated without repeat iterations \[E6\]. 

 **COVID\-19** 

 In September 2020, IONTAS and FairJourney announced the discovery of 15 potent antibodies that neutralise SARS\-COV\-2 virus in tests. The antibodies have been shown to block infection by SARS\-CoV2 virus at doses as low as 20 picomolar \(pM\) in pseudoviral assays and 100 pM in live coronavirus assays, matching or surpassing the best antibodies reported. All 15 antibodies are optimally suited to clinical development and manufacturing \[E9\]. 

  

 **Customer satisfaction** 

 IONTAS has built its reputation for delivering reliable products that other companies find challenging. The company Adaptate Biotherapeutics used the IONTAS Mammalian Display Technology in December 2019 to select antibodies with optimal biophysical properties for novel immuno\-oncology targets. The Chief Executive Officer of Adaptate Biotherapeutics, said: “IONTAS has developed an impressive track record in delivering therapeutic antibodies. We selected them as our partner because of their extensive experience in overcoming antibody project challenges using their industry\-leading platforms. We anticipate that the combination of IONTAS’ antibody discovery capabilities and our innovative approach to gamma delta T cell\-targeted therapeutics will facilitate the accelerated entry of our oncology portfolio to the clinic” \[E10\]. 

  

 Medicxi, a venture capital life science company engaged IONTAS after an unsuccessful attempt with another service provider. They were founding another company, Super X, and were engaged in efforts to develop an antibody lead molecule with challenging requirements in terms of specificity and function. The venture partner at Medicxi gave testimony to IONTAS’ services: “In the end the project proved to be too difficult \[for the initial service provider\] and no lead molecules were generated. We were aware of IONTAS and their excellent reputation…we re\-ignited the project and were not disappointed. John…and the IONTAS team…delivered the lead molecules we sought within the specified timelines. The knowledge that we can rely on IONTAS to deliver “developable” molecules with required properties, on time, significantly de\-risks our investment decisions” \[E11\]. 

 Work carried out at IONTAS, building upon previous research carried out by Dr McCafferty at the University of Cambridge, has been crucial in de\-risking and accelerating therapeutic antibody discovery services by furthering phage display technology. This has facilitated new collaborations between leading researchers and organisations, stimulated investment and created new enterprises, leading to employment of 32 people.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 At the heart of this study is the concert series *Stravinsky: Myths and Rituals* \(2016\) given in London, Aix\-en\-Provence and San Francisco by the Philharmonia Orchestra. It was devised and implemented by Jonathan Cross, Series Consultant, alongside Principal Conductor, Esa\-Pekka Salonen. The beneficiaries of Cross’s research included professional musicians, marketers, digital producers, designers, broadcasters, and audiences. In presenting the music of Stravinsky through ‘intelligent programming, brilliant performances’ \( *Observer*\), a new public was brought to engage with a body of significant 20th century artistic activity, and the work of professional practitioners was extended and deepened. The project’s significance was recognised by the South Bank Sky Arts Award 2017 for Classical Music. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The principal underpinning research was published as a monograph in 2015 **\[R1\]** with Cross as sole author. The research was supported primarily by the Bodleian Library Oxford, the British Library, and the Paul Sacher Stiftung Basel \(the key holding of sketches, manuscripts and other documents relating to Stravinsky\), and by an AHRC Research Leave Award. Cross’s wide knowledge of Stravinsky’s music and its contexts was drawn on fully to inform the Philharmonia project, as well as ongoing impact work with commercial and non\-UK educational organisations. Some of Cross’s work is of a technical, musical\-analytical nature **\[e.g. R2\]**, and while the details of this are not necessarily appropriate for a general audience, nonetheless his understanding of compositional processes and analytical reception of the works deeply informs the ways in which he is able to explain the music to make it accessible to a wider public. 

 *Igor Stravinsky* **\[R1\]**, written \(though not exclusively\) with a non\-specialist readership in mind, and widely reviewed in both academic and non\-academic publications, took a new angle on Stravinsky’s life and work. It argued that it was the composer’s life as an émigré \(further explored in **\[R3 & R4\]**\) which shaped and coloured his creative work. It presented a re\-evaluation that critiqued earlier sub\-divisions of the composer’s life and work into discrete creative periods, and instead took an interdisciplinary understanding of modernism as a means to interrogate the creation, structure and reception of the music across the entire output. New relationships between works emerged; new contexts were proposed. Lesser\-known or understudied works were situated alongside more familiar works. The research explored in detail the connections between music and place \(see also **\[R5\]**\), and between Stravinsky’s music and his cultural milieu, contemporaries and collaborators \(from Auden to Proust, Cocteau to Picasso, Boulanger to Souvtchinsky\), as well as his successors \(discussed further in **\[R6\]**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Informed Marketing Strategies, Developed Professional Practice 

 Cross was approached in 2012 by the Philharmonia Orchestra to work as Series Consultant alongside one of the world’s leading conductors, Esa\-Pekka Salonen, to devise and deliver a major concert series consisting exclusively of the music of Stravinsky, including semi\-staged operas and ballets. The main series was to be presented in London in 2016, with repeat events in Aix\-en\-Provence and San Francisco. The challenge was to engage a public with music that they might find unfamiliar or difficult. The objective was to reach as wide an audience as possible. The Head of Marketing was explicit about utilizing Cross’s ‘expertise … to talk in a way that resonated with people – audiences, the media – that even … Salonen couldn’t or wouldn’t be able to do’ **\[A.i\]**. 

 The Philharmonia exploited Cross’s research in order to ‘bring the series alive in terms of the depth of understanding we wanted to convey about who Stravinsky was and what his music meant’ **\[A.i\]**. Cross thus worked from the start in collaboration with Salonen to decide on repertoire and shape programmes; and to help deliver a marketing strategy, audience engagement, professional development, and media content. ‘What Jonathan’s really good at is being able to cover things in depth while doing things in a really accessible way.’ **\[A.i\]**. The Philharmonia’s Concert Manager acknowledged how Cross developed the team’s approach: ‘We pushed the envelope … I don’t think we would have been able to understand it and feel as confident if we didn’t have \[Jonathan\] there’ **\[A.ii\]**. 

 Cross worked with the entire Philharmonia marketing team to enrich their understanding of the music of Stravinsky, including running a half\-day company seminar. The Head of Marketing attests: ‘Jonathan added value at each step of \[the\] process.’ ‘The marketing team had access to materials and ideas and expertise at 100x the depth we usually would have’ **\[A.i\]**. It changed the team’s thinking on how to make the music accessible, and how to shape the accompanying digital work. Cross also worked alongside the Series Designer to advise on the development of an appropriate and consistent visual language to promote the project \(used online, in\-hall branding, publicity, programme book, London Underground advertising campaign, etc.\) ‘Jonathan’s deep knowledge of Stravinsky – and his excellent biography **\[R2\]** – were crucial in helping us build a successful campaign generating excitement around the Philharmonia Orchestra’s special programme’ **\[A.iii\]**. 

 One crucial aspect of the impact of Cross’s research was that he was able to help develop the practice of professional musicians. The Orchestra’s Principal Clarinetist observed, ‘Taking part in the thrilling Philharmonia series, “Stravinsky, Myths and Rituals”, conceived and presented by Jonathan Cross and Esa\-Pekka Salonen, was a revelation to many of us. ... \[M\]uch of this music was new to us. ... What amazing music\! *Agon* in particular will always stay with me, with striking choreography to match the strangeness of this amazing music’ **\[A.iv\]**. Cross also worked as advisor to professional theatre and opera director Irina Brown in coordinating the drama with the music of the semi\-staged productions of *Mavra* and *Renard*. The two spent time together working through the dramatic implications of the music so that Brown was then able to refine her understanding of the works in order fully to develop her directorial ideas, as recognised by the *Telegraph*: ‘ *Mavra* hit the mark again thanks to a simple staging’ **\[B.i\]**. 

 **Reception and recognition** 

 Cross’s role was singled out in the national press \(‘brilliantly contextualized by the series consultant Jonathan Cross’, **\[B.i\]**\). The series was selected by the *Guardian* and *Observer* as among top musical events of 2016 **\[B.ii & B.iii\]**. Other professionals recognized the originality and significance of the series \(‘it’s been one of the highlights of 35 years of concert\-going, brilliantly planned and a chance to hear things that one hardly ever hears live’, **\[A.v\]**\). The series was shortlisted for a 2017 Royal Philharmonic Society award, and received the South Bank Sky Arts Award 2017 for Classical Music, both citations mentioning its innovation and high musical standards. In presenting the Sky Arts Award, trumpeter Alison Balsom praised ‘an exceptionally rich series of works, due to both their inspired curation \[by Cross\] and enthralling performances. Audiences have been captivated by this presentation of music, drawing upon folklore and myth, which have been fresh and uncompromising. … The winner's performances have been described as electrifying, compelling and, indeed, revelatory’ **\[B.iv\]**. 

 **Deepened public understanding; Stravinsky’s music brought to a wider audience** 

 The series was supported by an 86\-page programme book **\[F\]**, edited and mainly authored by Cross \(approximately 1000 copies sold **\[C.i\]**, ‘way above \[what\] we would \[usually\] see’ **\[B.i\]**\). It was also distributed free to selected public and university libraries. One critic tweeted, ‘What a FANTASTIC programme book\! … One to keep’ **\[B.v\]**. Cross also authored content for the dedicated interactive series website \(approximately 4,500 views **\[D.i\]** across the duration of the series – described in the French press as ‘an excellent online project’ **\[B.vi\]**\). He scripted and presented material for YouTube and other sites, notably *Stravinsky’s Journeys* **\[E.i\]** *,* a 35’ film placing the composer in context, accessed over 50,000 times **\[D.ii\]**, as well as a shorter film on myth **\[E.ii\]**, viewed approximately 3,000 times **\[D.iii\]**. These solicited many positive YouTube user comments. \(‘Inspiring’. ‘Beautifully filmed and scripted’. ‘I will be recommending this video to music students embarking on music history in their studies.’ **\[B.vii\]**\) 

 Cross gave a series of well\-attended and well\-received free pre\-concert talks and study days at the Royal Festival Hall. The Director of Music and Performing Arts, Southbank Centre, observed, ‘Jonathan Cross has the rare talent of being able to take some of the most complex musical ideas and explain them in a manner that is both compelling and illuminating for a non\-specialist audience. He brings his academic research and knowledge into the public realm and makes it both accessible and utterly authentic’ **\[A.vi\]**. All five concerts were broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 to enable much wider reach. Cross participated in the broadcast of the opening concert, explaining the context of the music to listeners **\[G.i\]**. Attendance in London alone was over 6,000, achieving net income of approximately GBP100,000 **\[C.ii\]**. One concert showcased rarely heard late works to a near sell\-out audience. The Concert Manager of the Philharmonia Orchestra states ‘We definitely got some new audience … because it was so unusual’ **\[A.ii\]**.\) After the final concert, Salonen wrote personally to Cross: ‘many thanks for your invaluable help, expertise and passion’ **\[A.vii\]**. 

 **Increased engagement with Stravinsky through media appearances, international educational programmes and publishing consultancy** 

 Cross appears regularly on BBC Radio 3 to discuss Stravinsky, e.g., *Music Matters* \(31 October 2015\) **\[G.ii\]**; *The Listening Service* \(17 June 2018\) **\[G.iii\]**; *Record Review,* ‘Building a Library: *The Rite of Spring* \(6 July 2019\) **\[G.iv\]**. *The Listening Service* has 115,000 weekly listeners **\[D.iv\]**, and thus Cross’s research is able to reach a very wide public and raise awareness of the music of Stravinsky from the perspective of musical performances. The *Record Review* Series Producer wrote, ‘You did a wonderful thing on Stravinsky recordings for us on Record Review last summer’ **\[A.viii\]**. And an unsolicited email from a national music critic wrote of the *Rite of Spring* programme, ‘Brilliant\! It’s the first one I’ve heard in the new … live format that has actually worked, thanks to your combo of erudition and ease of conversation’ **\[B.viii\]**. 

 In 2016 Cross was *professeur invité* at the Paris Conservatoire where he delivered a three\-month masters course \(in French\) on ‘Stravinsky and the modern world’, challenging francophone performance students with unfamiliar Anglo\-American ideas and literature, as well as introducing them to new teaching and learning methods. The Conservatoire’s music history lead commented, ‘Not only did the sessions allow the history class students to meet one of the finest current Stravinsky specialists, but they also had the chance to discover what collective seminar work is as it is practised in English\-speaking universities.’ The visit ‘helped raise awareness for the future musicologist who made up the music history class of professional practices with which they were unfamiliar’ **\[A.ix\]**. One student, who was a member of the seminar, and who went on to hold a major national position in French music criticism observed that ‘it was also very enriching for us, French students accustomed to Paris Conservatoire's methods, to discover and experiment with the new tools and other ways of working typical of the higher education across the Channel. … Jonathan Cross thus influenced not only the work of the students but also that of our teacher … and the modus operandi of the music history class at the Conservatoire’ **\[A.x\]**. 

 Cross is consultant to the music publisher Boosey & Hawkes, preparing for the 50th anniversary of Stravinsky’s death \(2021\) to promote the work around the world. He authored *Stravinsky Connections: A Guide for Performers and Programmers*, a 40\-page brochure with a print\-run of 2000 copies **\[C.iii\]**, distributed to 37 countries **\[A.xi\]**, also downloadable, and translated into Spanish. His essays featured in five issues of the B&H online newsletter **\[H.i–v\]** \(10,000\-person mailing list per issue **\[C.iv\]**\). International music promoters, performers, opera houses, dance companies and festival organizers thus benefit from Cross’s research in helping them to rethink and extend their activity. For Boosey & Hawkes, exploiting 'Cross’s research has commercial significance, quantifiable in terms of additional performances and broadcasts, recording and streaming revenue, rental fees, licensed royalty income, and sheet music sales, as well as wider awareness across territories of Stravinsky's work’ **\[A.xi\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Central banks have become dramatically more transparent in recent decades. More transparent central bank communications make it easier for the public to infer the central bank’s intentions and align private sector expectations, thereby making monetary policy more effective in stabilising financial markets and the economy more broadly, while also increasing public accountability. Dr Geraats, at the University of Cambridge, has made significant contributions to reviews of central bank transparency practices at the Bank of England \(2014\) and at the Central Bank of Chile \(2019\), which resulted in substantial reforms of the central banks’ communication strategies. She served \(2019\-20\) on a High\-Level Advisory Panel to guide the development of the International Monetary Fund’s \(IMF\) new Central Bank Transparency \(CBT\) Code, which is now the standard for all IMF members. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Geraats, based at the University of Cambridge, has since 2000 conducted theoretical, empirical and applied policy research on monetary policy, transparency and central banking. 

 Her research provides clarity about the wide\-ranging notion of transparency by developing a conceptual framework of five aspects of transparency \(political, economic, procedural, policy, and operational transparency\) that she presented in a highly cited paper from 2002 **\[R1\]**. This conceptual framework allows academics and policymakers to think systematically about various facets of transparency, to better understand their different roles and potential effects. 

 Geraats used this framework to develop a popular index of central bank transparency in 2006 **\[R2\]**. The index pioneered a methodical quantification of this hard to measure, multi\-faceted concept, and it has facilitated a systematic comparison across central banks and over time. 

 This transparency index has been updated and extended by Geraats and others, including **\[R3\]**, which documents and analyses the degree of monetary policy transparency for 112 central banks \(covering nearly 150 countries\) from 1998 until 2015. This 2019 Dincer\-Eichengreen\-Geraats index **\[R3\]** \(and its predecessors, building on the 2006 Eijffinger\-Geraats index **\[R2\]**\) has become the standard in the literature. It has been widely used in empirical research and is well\-known among central bankers. 

 Geraats has used the deep insights she has gained from her theoretical and empirical research to do applied policy research, most notably involving the evaluation of central banks. In 2004, she participated in an independent evaluation of the Norwegian central bank and the report she co\-authored **\[R7\]** was submitted to the Norwegian parliament as part of the formal accountability process of the central bank. She also co\-authored an evaluation of the European Central Bank that focused on transparency and governance **\[R8\]**. In September 2018, Dr Geraats was appointed by the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to an independent evaluation panel to assess the fulfilment of the Bank’s legal objectives, including price and financial stability **\[R4\]**. 

 Geraats’s research has shown how greater transparency can improve macroeconomic outcomes. The publication of central bank forecasts allows central bankers to build reputation through their policy actions – instead of through policy outcomes, which take much longer to materialise. It gives central banks greater flexibility to engage in macroeconomic stabilisation **\[R5\]**. Her research shows that it is beneficial to provide clarity about the central bank’s inflation target, although it may be desirable to communicate some other types of information \(e.g., about its output objectives or supply shocks\) with perceived ambiguity, encouraging a more nuanced view of central bank communications **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In December 2014 the Bank of England \(BoE\) published an independent review it had commissioned on the transparency practices and procedures of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. The aim of the review was to improve the Bank’s communication policies and procedures. ""Transparency and the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee"" **\[S1\]** \(known as the ‘Warsh Review’\) was written by former US Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh. This Review heavily relies on Dr Geraats’s research and fully reflects the views she expressed at a meeting she had with Governor Warsh \(on 25 September 2014 at the BoE at his request\). 

 The Warsh Review adopted Geraats’s conceptual framework of transparency **\[R1\]**, which is illustrated in Figures 2 and 4 of the Warsh report **\[S1,** p.6 and p.16 **\]** and explained in its section ""Transparency, defined"" **\[S1,** pp.15\-16 **\]**. Section 4 of the report, ""Peer review: comparison of central banks"" **\[S1,** starting on p.27 **\]**, uses the 2006 Eijffinger\-Geraats transparency index **\[R2\]**, which is detailed in Annex 3 **\[S1,** pp.54\-57 **\]** and shown in Figures 10 and 11 **\[S1,** p.27 and p.28 **\]**. The subsection ""The Review's independent survey"" **\[S1,** pp.29\-31 **\]** is explicitly structured around Geraats’s 2002 transparency framework **\[R1\]**, focusing on the economic, procedural and policy aspects. Finally, the Review's recommendations for transparency improvements are summarised in Figure 16 **\[S1,** pp.41\-42 **\],** which uses Geraats’s framework **\[R1\]**. 

 The BoE accepted the recommendations of the Warsh Review and announced significant changes to its transparency practices, outlined in the December 2014 BoE press release ""Bank of England announces measures to bolster transparency and accountability"" **\[S2\]**. Governor Carney stated that these are “ *the most significant set of changes to how we present and explain our interest rate decisions since the Monetary Policy Committee was formed in 1997*” **\[S2,** p.1 **\]**. With the intention of reducing market volatility caused by the previous ‘drip\-feed’ of information, the Warsh Review recommended that the BoE adopt international best practice by releasing a prompt announcement of the monetary policy decision that includes an explanation and the individual voting records. The BoE implemented these transparency improvements in August 2015, thereby making it easier for financial markets and the general public to understand its monetary policy decisions. The Review’s author thanked Geraats for her contribution: *""Many thanks for your keen insights and exhaustive research. You made an immeasurable contribution to our review of the MPC \- and to actual reforms for implementation.""* **\[S3\]**. 

 In September 2018 the Central Bank of Chile \(CBC\) commissioned a comprehensive external evaluation of the Bank's performance in achieving its legal objectives of price and financial stability. The CBC appointed Geraats to the independent evaluation panel, which consisted of five international experts. She contributed to the evaluation’s terms of reference and drafted a large part of the report, including the two chapters on communications. 

 On 4 September 2019 CBC Governor Marcel presented a summary of the main findings of the independent evaluation panel before a plenary session of the Chilean Senate **\[S4\]**. In his presentation of the panel’s main findings **\[S4,** pp.15\-17 and p.26 **\]**, he made special mention of the panel’s evaluation of monetary policy transparency **\[S4,** p.16 **\]** and showcased the 2019 Dincer\-Eichengreen\-Geraats **\[R3\]** monetary policy transparency index **\[S4,** p.25 **\]**. The CBC published an official response to the evaluation in September 2019 **\[S5\]** and pledged to act on nearly all recommendations. The full report was released on 6 December 2019 **\[R4\]**. The sections on monetary policy communications **\[R4,** chapter 4, pp.38\-73 **\]** extensively draws on Geraats’s research and contains a dozen references to her publications. 

 At his annual testimony **\[S6\]** before the Senate on 2 September 2020, Governor Marcel presented a detailed progress update **\[S6,** Table 4 **\]** and reported that 23 of the panel’s 40 main recommendations “ *have been fully complied with*”, while another ten “ *are close to completion*” and five others still “ *under study*” **\[S6,** p.7 **\]**. Nine of the ten recommendations pertaining to communications have been implemented or are ‘soon to be implemented’ **\[S6,** Table 4 **\]**. The Governor highlighted publication of the CBC’s updated monetary policy framework, and the introduction of a new \(graphical\) tool for communicating the orientation of future monetary policy, thereby improving transparency and making it easier for the public to understand monetary policymaking. Additionally, Governor Marcel drew attention to the first\-ever formulation and publication of the CBC’s financial policy framework, which “ *has been especially relevant in framing the Bank’s decisions in light of the various volatility episodes experienced in Chile since last November \[when social turmoil erupted\]*” **\[S6,** p.8 **\]**.  Moreover, Governor Marcel highlighted the constitutional and legal reform that is on the agenda, emanating from the evaluation panel’s report **\[R4\],** and that will *“entitle the Bank to acquire fiscal instruments in the secondary market to contain risks to financial stability”* **\[S6,** p.8 **\]**. According to Governor Marcel, *“this power will allow the Bank to prepare itself to address future episodes of volatility in the markets that may jeopardize financial stability and, thus, the welfare of the population.”* **\[S6,** p.8 **\]**. 

 In November 2019 the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\) appointed Geraats to a High\-Level Advisory Panel that helped shape the IMF's new Central Bank Transparency \(CBT\) Code **\[S7\]**. The new Code was approved in July 2020 by the IMF’s Executive Board and replaces the IMF's Monetary and Financial Policies Transparency Code from 1999. The new CBT Code aims to provide clear, detailed guidance to central banks regarding their own transparency and echoes **\[S7,** p.6 **\]** Geraats’s transparency framework \[ **R1**\]. The CBT Code is now the standard for all IMF members, enabling them to improve their policy effectiveness and accountability. The Managing Director of the IMF states, “ *Your \[Geraats’s\] many contributions \[…\] allowed us to incorporate valuable insights from your extensive central bank experience. They allowed us to better address a range of complex issues, including how transparency can improve the effectiveness of monetary and macroprudential policy, the delicate balance between confidentiality and transparency, and key aspects of central bank governance, organization, and autonomy*” **\[S8\]**.

 Christie Watson’s memoir *The Language of Kindness* \(2018\) is a first\-hand account of twenty years at the frontline of nursing, which has had impact on the public discourse regarding the distinctive contribution of nurses in our society and how the nursing profession shapes the nature of our healthcare systems in significant ways, specifically: 

 a.  Attitudes, awareness and understanding of the vocation and profession of nursing in the media and in public and professional discourse. 

 b. Support for nurses and developments in practitioner attitudes and behaviours within the nursing profession itself. 

 c. Public recognition of the specialist role and identity of nursing as a profession. 

 d. Affected individual readers, especially those whose lives have been touched by nursing provision.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 *The Language of Kindness* \( **3.1**\) was written by Christie Watson, who was a Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at St Mary’s University, Twickenham between July 2016 and October 2018. First published in 2018, *The Language of Kindness*, saw Watson build on themes apparent in her earlier works: a memoir, *With Tiny Sunbirds Far Away* \(2011\) \( **3.2**\), \(winner of the Costa First Book award\), and *Where Women are Kings* \(2013\) \( **3.3**\). In these works Watson examined complex family relationships and experiences of family hardship, along with issues such as identity and belonging. 

 These themes were continued in *The Language of Kindness*, a memoir providing an insider’s perspective on life as a nurse. Watson drew on her nursing career between 1993 and 2013, and her work at the hospitals of Great Ormond Street, St Mary’s Paddington, and Guy’s and St Thomas. Drawing on first\-hand experiences of treating patients, working alongside doctors, and interacting with relatives, all recalled from memory, and delicately presented to protect individual identities, Watson paints a vivid, and uniquely contemporary, picture of what it means and what it takes to be a nurse. In researching the genre prior to writing the book, Watson notes that, despite the countless medical memoirs written by doctors, the only other existing account of working as a nurse was written by Florence Nightingale in the nineteenth century. At the very heart of her account, and this is perhaps that which most shapes its impact on readers, is a series of profound insights into the nature of contemporary nursing, the complex array of expertise and skills, the careful balance of conviction and compassion, the emotional intelligence, which has not been articulated so clearly for public appreciation previously. 

 Watson’s portrayal is undoubtedly affecting on an individual level and has resonated with many who have interacted with frontline health services, but its greatest impact has been at the level of public discourse about the profession of nursing. By illustrating the distinctive role of nurses in the delivery of ‘healthcare with humanity’, that is, the provision of essential care and support to patients and relatives above and beyond their fundamental medical needs, necessary because of their very nature as human beings, Watson’s work raises important questions about the identity and efficacy of healthcare systems as the demands placed on them continue to rise and resources are stretched. By implication, it raises questions about the nature of our societies and whether we have room in those societies for ‘kindness’. Nursing, as a profession of care provision, is placed at the heart of that debate. *The Language of Kindness* has, to date, been translated into over twenty languages, including Chinese, Spanish, and Russian, reflecting the universality of its appeal and its message.

 **Impact on attitudes, awareness and understanding of the vocation and profession of nursing in the media and in public and professional discourse**. 

 The publication of *The Language of Kindness* and the resulting reviews, print, radio, and television interviews, readings, and other outreach activities that Watson has conducted, have resulted in a wide\-reaching enhancement of public and professional discourse regarding the nature of nursing and its value to healthcare systems. Watson’s contribution is unique in that it stands apart as a nursing\-specific memoir, and especially compelling as a narrative based on twenty years of frontline nursing. In a review for *The Observer* \(29th April 2018\), Molly Case – herself a nurse – acknowledges: “ *The Language of Kindness* is part of the swell of medical memoirs. But this one is different – it is from the perspective of a nurse” \( **5.1a**\). The book was ‘Book of the Week’ on BBC Radio 4 from 7th\-12th May 2018, and Watson herself appeared at least four times on national radio between May 2018 and February 2019 to discuss issues raised by her work and the reaction to it. On 10th May 2018, Watson appeared on Steve Wright in the Afternoon on BBC Radio 2 – a show with a reported audience of over 8 million weekly listeners \( **5.1f**\). Watson has been interviewed on television, notably on the BBC News Channel \(3rd May 2018\), London Live TV \(3rd May 2018\), ITV News London \(7th May 2018\) and ‘Lorraine’ on ITV \(15th August 2018\) \( **5.1f**\). 

 *The Language of Kindness* received national and international acclaim upon its publication, for both its style and substance, becoming a number one *Sunday Times* bestseller \(27th January 2019\) and appearing in ‘Books of the Year’ selections for *The Daily Telegraph*, *New Statesman*, *The Times*, *The Guardian*, and *The Sunday Times*. Watson has appeared in major interview and feature articles for *The Daily Telegraph* \(30th April 2018\), *The Bookseller* \(26th February 2018\) and *The Sunday Times Magazine* \(15th April 2018\) amongst many others \( **5.1f**\). In November 2018, Watson was awarded a *Marie Claire* ‘Future Shapers’ award as one of eleven women “innovating the way we live and work” \( **5.2**\). *The Language of Kindness* has been praised for bringing to the world’s attention the vital, yet otherwise unvoiced, work of a profession that is often overlooked and undervalued. Adam Kay \(a doctor and writer\) reflects in his review for *The Guardian*: “It struck me again and again how little we hear from nurses, how quiet their voice is, how poorly represented they are on our bookshelves. All this despite the crucial role they inevitably play in our lives and those of our families. It also struck me how poorly we understand what this role truly involves – even if, like me, you have worked alongside them” \( **5.1b**\). Of great significance is how the book shapes public discourse regarding the value of nursing to the sustainability of our healthcare systems. In her review for *The Times* \(22nd April 2018\), Jackie Annesley states: “anyone curious as to how the NHS staggers on would do well to read \[ *The Language of Kindness*\]. The answer lies in the compassion of people like Watson” \( **5.1c**\), and Alisson Pearson writing in *The Telegraph* \(24th June 2018\) is frank in her assessment of the book’s underlying message: “This is not an overtly political work, although its description of nurses under intolerable pressure powerfully makes the case for giving a chunk of the extra £20 billion for the NHS, promised this week by the Prime Minister, to those underpaid, overworked and mainly female staff on the frontline” \( **5.1d**\). 

 The immediate set and cast of Watson’s book, namely UK\-based hospitals, and staff, naturally lean our attention towards the value of nursing to the NHS. Health policy is, however, a global issue, often at the forefront of public debate, and healthcare systems worldwide rely to the same extent on nurses. Of the 43.5 million health workers in the world, the World Health Organisation estimates that 20.7 million are nurses and midwives. Hence, the international significance of the work is noteworthy. The appeal and relevance of the work and its impact on readers crosses societies and cultures, as evidenced by international reviews. Writing in her review in *The New York Times* \(27th June 2018\), Roxana Robinson writes: “ *The Language of Kindness* could not be more compelling or more welcome: It’s about how we survive, and about the people who help us do so” \( **5.1e**\). 

 **Impact on support for nurses and developments in practitioner attitudes and behaviours within the nursing profession.** 

 In July 2018, Watson became patron of The Royal College of Nursing \(RCN\) Foundation, which provides support, grants, and training for nurses. Her appointment coincided with a ‘Language of Kindness’ fundraising walk, which Watson spearheaded, that raised £5,300 – more than triple the target \( **5.3**\). Robert Sowney, chair of the RCN Foundation, said on Watson’s appointment: “\[Watson\] is a true champion of nursing … We are looking forward to working even more closely with \[Watson\] in the future to support and strengthen nursing and improve patient care” \( **5.4**\). 

 The book itself has directly impacted those training as nurses. Duke Hervey, a trainee nurse, writes in a review: “This book was just what I needed to be reminded of during my final year as a student nurse. Being kind is of fundamental importance particularly in nursing, and \[Watson\] really highlights this in her inspirational book. A stunning read” \( **5.5**\). Another trainee nurse, Rachel Martin, wrote on Twitter on 19th February 2019: “Just finished *The Language of Kindness* by \[Watson\]. My eyes are stinging. As I approach the finish line of my nursing training, I feel many of my worries & questions remain. After reading this book my anxiety has eased and I just can’t wait to start my own nursing journey” \( **5.6**\). Professor Jane Cummings, Chief Nursing Officer for England \(from 2012 to 2019\) and Chair of the Board of Trustees for the RCN Foundation emphasises the importance of the work to nurses, as she writes: “A poignant and powerful account of what it’s like to be a nurse. It’s a profession that touches all our lives delivering expert and compassionate care from the cradle to the grave. A must\-read for nurses and those interested in understanding the true art and science of nursing"" \( **5.7**\). 

 On 15th May 2018, Watson was invited to address the RCN annual congress in Belfast as keynote speaker. In her speech, Watson praised the work of her fellow nurses and called for greater support for the nursing profession. Responses to her speech, taken from nurses who were present, made clear the impact of her work and her message. Chair of congress, Stuart McKenzie, stated: “I’d like to thank \[Watson\] for articulating to us without boundaries and reminding us of what we are and just what we do.” Mike Travis, a delegate, said: “I’ve been coming to congress for 36 years and for a description of what nurses do and what we are, that was the best. Your book will have an impact on nurses. Your book will have an impact on the wider public and help them understand just what we do for them. I’ll certainly be using your book to help my colleagues through a very difficult time” \( **5.8**\). 

 **Impact on public recognition of the specialist role and identity of nursing as a profession.** 

 To date *The Language of Kindness* has sold over 250,000 copies in the UK and Commonwealth territories, with 23 foreign editions. As well as the interviews on national media previously mentioned, Watson has taken part in webchats \(Mumsnet 17th May 2018\) and podcast interviews \(Vintage Podcast 3rd May 2018, Audible Sessions Podcast 3rd May 2018, Penguin Podcast 9th May 2018\), spoken at 14 festivals including Hay Festival \(3rd June 2018\), Latitude \(15th July 2018\) and Edinburgh International Book Festival \(16th August 2018\) and delivered readings at various bookshop and library events \( **5.1f**\). The combined audience that has listened to Watson talk about her work, either directly in person or indirectly through various media, is certainly in the millions \(considering viewing and listening numbers for the television and radio shows she has appeared on alone\). 

 On 12th November 2019, Christie Watson delivered a book reading and Q&A session at the St Mary’s University, Twickenham, University Women’s Club. To assess the audience response to her work, ‘before and after’ surveys were completed by the attendees and subsequently analysed by Professor Pauline Foster. There was a marked shift in results from before the event to after; after the event, all attendees either mostly or totally agreed that they ‘knew a lot about nurses’ working lives’, the exact opposite of the responses to the same question asked prior to Watson’s speech. Attendees were also invited to offer words to describe the nursing profession before and after the event. Pauline Foster summarises the results: “the effect of the event was a discernible shift in attendees’ perceptions of nurses as overworked, underpaid angels towards a different perception of them as overworked, underpaid professionals. The perception of nurses as doing rewarding, but insufficiently rewarded work remained, but a recognition is detectable that the vocational bedrock of nursing needs to get more credit” \( **5.9**\). In assessing the impact of Watson’s work on how we think about nursing and its contribution to society, Caroline Sanderson – in her profile feature for The Bookseller – writes: “It packs the same unswerving frankness about the demands of the medical profession as Adam Kay’s This is Going to Hurt. But it is also a transcendent book that takes the temperature of our society, in the process asking searching questions about the human qualities we should prize most” \( **5.10**\). Watson herself has noted that “while the book started off being about the life of a nurse, it became something much broader about humanity”; a conclusion that neatly encapsulates the profound significance of the work to us all. 

 **Impact on individuals affected by frontline healthcare provision**. 

 *The Language of Kindness* has had extensive impact on individual readers, especially those who have relied upon or been impacted by nursing provision. Miss C Brown, the parent of a child with complex medical needs, writes in her book review \(8th February 2019\): “Thank you for writing this book. I suspect people who have not been exposed to the world of hospitals may be in for a bit of a shock and it would be great if more people could read it.” \( **5.5**\). C S George writes \(12th June 2018\): “This is an incredible book that everyone should read. Thank goodness for our NHS and thank goodness for nurses.” \( **5.5**\). William Marler writes \(5th February 2019\): “My life has been dependent on the NHS and I’ve spent more time with nurses so far than many people will in a lifetime. They are the heart and soul of our nation. It makes me proud that my mother has been a nurse for over 37 years. *The Language of Kindness* is a celebration of nursing and its vital role in the recovery and wellbeing of the sick.” \( **5.5**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The A350 is the first Airbus airliner with composite wings, saving 25% in fuel, CO<sub>2</sub> and operating cost compared with earlier metallic aircraft, with GKN supplying the rear spars \- the backbone of the new wings. New modelling and testing methodologies created at the University of Bath have allowed GKN to: \(i\) meet the Airbus production rate increase from 1 per month in 2013 to 13 per month \(and revenues of GBP150,000,000 per year\) in 2018, and \(ii\) reduce spar scrappage, with direct savings of GBP11,000,000 per year and over 1,200tCO<sub>2</sub>/year from reduced material wastage. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Richard Butler co\-directs the Materials & Structures Centre \(MAST\). His group has developed composite analysis and design methods in collaboration with Airbus for over 25 years. Throughout 2011 he undertook a part\-time Royal Academy of Engineering industrial secondment at GKN. At this time, GKN was carrying out pre\-production trials for the manufacture of the composite Airbus A350 rear wing spar \(see Fig. 1\). This secondment established the need for model\-based methods, both to reduce defects in production parts and to qualify the strength of such parts, leading to the award of Butler’s RAEng\-GKN Research Chair in Composites Analysis \(2013\-2023\). Together, these methods would enable the increase in production rate required by Airbus whilst eliminating scrappage. 

 The Research Chair set clear objectives within a programme plan. Progress was reviewed at fortnightly meetings with GKN Engineering & Technology leads, with one appointed as Senior Visiting Researcher at the University of Bath, 2015\-2021. Reports and papers were reviewed by GKN before publication and dissemination, generating underpinning research at University of Bath under the leadership of Richard Butler, in the following two areas: 

 **Production process models and material characterisation** *\(extends research established for REF2014 Case Study to achieve REF2021 impact\)* 

 A corner wrinkling model \[1\],\( see Fig. 2 \(a\)\), and a new Finite Element \[2\] were created by MAST researcher Tim Dodwell following his secondment to GKN in 2012. These methods provided new insights into the conditions required to avoid defect generation during laminate production. University of Bath MAST researchers then developed slip characterisation tests for pre\-cured composite materials \[3\], locating the temperature that minimises slip resistance during viscoelastic consolidation of layers of carbon fibres, pre\-impregnated with epoxy resin. 

 **Structural performance models and test protocols** *\(new research for REF2021 impact\)* 

 In 2014, MAST researchers developed a new test protocol \[4\] in which a tough resin layer is bonded to the edges of narrow witness specimens to alleviate interlaminar stress concentrations \(and numerical singularities\) which are not present within wide, in\-situ parts. This increased the strength of ‘witness’ specimens by up to 40%. An EPSRC Multiscale Modelling of Composites project discovered that micron\-scale Finite Elements \(FEs\) are required to accurately predict critical stresses between layers in production parts with complex geometry and wrinkling defects, leading to between 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>9</sup> Degrees of Freedom \(DOF\) for most practical applications \(see Fig. 2 \(b\-c\)\). A new FE framework \[5, 6\], developed at the University of Bath, enabled solution of 10<sup>9</sup> DOF in minutes over 10<sup>3</sup> CPU cores on high\-performance computers, providing insight into how the issue of manufacturing variability can be addressed by analysis, which consequently reduces testing time. In 2018, this research led to the award of the GBP6,900,000 CerTest EPSRC Programme Grant, a collaboration between the Universities of Bath, Bristol, Exeter and Southampton, on virtual certification of aerospace composites.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The A350 spar manufacturing process adopted by GKN is the most demanding application of Automated Fibre Placement \(AFP\) of its time. Spars are assembled from three 10m\-long sections, as in Fig. 1\(a\), where each spar is made from 0.25mm thick layers of unidirectional carbon fibre composite. AFP robots deposit narrow tapes over complex male moulds, see Fig. 1\(b\), to produce parts of specified thickness, varying from tens to hundreds of layers. The so\-called preforms are then cured under controlled temperature and pressure to achieve 10% consolidation \(thickness reduction\). Layers must be free to slide over each other, otherwise wrinkles will occur in regions of high curvature, see Fig. 2 \(a\) and \(b\).  Spar sections are qualified by cutting narrow ‘witness’ sections from production parts and mechanically testing these for strength to failure.

 The impact of Bath research originates from: manufacturing process improvements, part qualification, and a shared research culture, as follows. 

 **Improvements to manufacturing process for A350 spar** 

 The corner wrinkling model \[1\] provided analytical insight into the formation of wrinkles in the A350 wing spar. Specifically, the new model led to the following 2 process improvements, described in GKN Manufacturing Build Instructions \[A\], which prevent the occurrence of wrinkling defects during production: 

 \(a\) Tools were introduced which were offset from the free edge of the spar laminate to ensure consolidation pressure was kept away from this edge. This provided a vacuum channel around the spar edge and allowed the fibres and resin to slide into this gap, thereby preventing wrinkling. 

 \(b\) The most critical influence was shown to be minimization of the viscosity of the resin material when consolidation occurred, and so a high\-temperature dwell was introduced when the part was under autoclave pressure. The critical conditions for this dwell were obtained using new test methods established by MAST researchers \[3\]. 

 According to the Vice President Engineering Technology & Quality at GKN, the impact of these innovations, from 2013 to 2018, is that \[A\]: 

 *“Together, these steps – supported by Bath’s fundamental research \- have enabled us to meet the ramp\-up in production rates for the A350, which was more aggressive than previous models, to meet commercial requirements due to the large investment in automation. This rate represents a contribution to annual revenue in excess of GBP150,000,000”.* 

 **Qualification of A350 spar strength** 

 The strength of spar corners is tested by bending the corner open until failure, which was expected to arise near the mid\-thickness but, in practice, occurred throughout the thickness of witness sections. Detailed FE analysis showed that this was due to an edge effect, that acts as stress concentration, which does not arise in the wing. Bath researchers developed a new edge treatment process \[4\] in which a tough resin layer is bonded to the exposed edges of witness specimens, see Fig. 3 \(a\), to alleviate the edge effect, see Fig. 3 \(b\), and produce repeatable failure near the mid\-thickness, which is more representative of *in situ* loading within the wing.

 **Fig. 3.** Edge treatment of spar corners: \(a\) geometry \(in mm\) and \(b\) reduction in normalised inter\-laminar tensile stress at edge \(y = b\), with varying elastic modulus of edge resin. 

 This process was accepted by airworthiness authorities and customer certification engineers \[A\], and the impact of this work to GKN is that \[A\]: 

 *“This protocol helped us to salvage all defective spars which would otherwise have been scrapped, … leading to an annual saving of GBP11,000,000. The effect of edge treatment was validated using MAST numerical modelling expertise, which we were able to use as evidence for customer approval of qualification”.* 

 saving 1,200tCO<sub>2</sub>/year from reduced material wastage from 2018 onwards. 

 **Shared research culture** 

 According to GKN \[A\]: 

 *“…the fundamental research developed at the University of Bath by MAST has led to significant improvement in our manufacturing processes, providing a positive impact, not only in financial terms, but also by achieving target productivity and enabling zero tolerance to defects during manufacturing, in line with our corporate strategy. As a direct consequence of impact from MAST research, we are delighted to have recently extended Richard’s RAEng/GKN Research Chair, and we* *anticipate new innovations leading to new business opportunities as we collaborate with MAST as core partners in our new Global Technology Centre*”.

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Innogen Institute research has demonstrated many flaws in today’s regulatory systems for innovative technologies and developed a framework for their future governance \(PAGIT\) showing how the necessary adaptation could be achieved, leading to two significant research impacts. 

-  Tait led the Prime Minister’s Council for Science and Technology initiative that culminated in publication of the White Paper on Regulation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, setting up four government initiatives designed to deliver the necessary regulatory adaptation. 

-  Funded by Innovate UK, the British Standards Institution commissioned Tait as technical author of a standard on Responsible Innovation to support responsible company behaviour in light of expected future changes in UK regulatory systems.

 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Tait and her colleagues at the Innogen Institute on the governance of innovative technologies covers both formal, legally\-based regulation of the safety, quality and efficacy of new developments and their societal acceptance, particularly the need for responsible innovation \(RI\). 

 They demonstrated the extent to which today’s regulatory systems are ill\-adapted to the needs of innovative technologies, leading to abandonment of innovations that could meet pressing societal needs and, particularly in life science sectors, loss of the creative innovation potential that could come from small companies with the ability to develop transformative, path\-breaking new developments \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\). Their portfolio of research cases provided evidence on how and where regulatory systems are having these negative effects for: diagnostic devices; drug development; initiatives to overcome antimicrobial resistance; regenerative medicine and stem cell therapies; agricultural biotechnology; animal cloning; and industrial biotechnology. This research was based on social science research methods including literature reviews, policy and regulatory document analysis, interviews with senior regulators and industry managers, and analysis of company innovation strategies, following the Innogen Institute interdisciplinary methodology \(3.4\). 

 A parallel research strand on RI, given the societal requirement for innovative products to be developed responsibly, pointed to the emphasis of most social science studies on responsible *research* rather than innovation, and the lack of advice and guidance for companies on how to ensure that their business models are responsible, and how to demonstrate that responsibility, given competing commercial pressures to be first to market, to maintain necessary confidentiality and to raise private sector investment \(3.5\). 

 Tait was awarded a CBE for services to social science in 2005 and, based on the research programme, has taken a proactive role in informing and advising on UK regulation and governance of innovative technologies. She has been a member of 32 UK, EU and US advisory bodies and committees, averages 13 invited presentations per year to conferences and workshops, and has responded to numerous UK Parliament and House of Lords consultations. This approach to seeding these ideas in relevant policy and industry communities proved invaluable in enabling the impacts described in Section 4. 

 By 2015, this research had made a convincing case for the scale of the negative impact on innovative technologies by disproportionate and non\-adaptive regulatory systems, and UK Government departments were looking for solutions to the problem. The UK Government Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), through the British Standards Institution \(BSI\) funded two projects to develop a framework for *Proportionate and Adaptive Governance of Innovative Technologies* \(PAGIT\) \(3.6\), with a supplement from an Edinburgh University ESRC Impact Acceleration Account. The aim was to cover both regulatory and societal aspects of governance, including regulatory adaptation led by government bodies and assurance of responsible innovation led by companies. 

 The PAGIT framework delineates \(i\) creative roles for regulatory and standards bodies in devising future regulations, standards and guidelines to govern the development and adoption of a technology and \(ii\) the nature of the support needed by companies in order, first, to assure themselves that they are behaving responsibly and, second, to demonstrate that responsible behaviour to stakeholders. 

 Two key actions recommended by the PAGIT Report \(3.6\) were: 

1.  to explore opportunities to use the PAGIT Framework to optimise the UK’s regulatory systems for innovative technologies; and 

1.  through BSI, to consider development of a standard on Responsible Innovation \(RI\).

 4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The PAGIT Report, and in particular two of its key recommendations, had the following impacts on UK Government. 

 From PAGIT to the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ 

 Following Tait’s appointment to the Prime Minister’s Council for Science and Technology \(CST\) in 2017, as outlined in the testimonial from the CST Secretary \(5.1\), she led the work on the CST project on ‘Reforming the Governance of Technological Innovation’. The outcome of this project, informed by the PAGIT report, was a letter to the then Prime Minister, Theresa May, sent on 27<sup>th</sup> September 2018 \(5.2\) with recommendations on: 

1.  developing a regulatory horizon\-scanning function … in the Better Regulation Executive \(BRE\); 

1.  considering guidance, codes and standards alongside formal regulation as part of a more flexible and responsible approach to governing innovation; 

1.  providing a ‘one\-stop\-shop’ for UK regulatory enquiries; and 

1.  evaluating governance of innovation including setting up ‘test beds’ to try out emerging innovations safely. 

 PAGIT was central to this letter, as specified by CST: PAGIT was used ” *as a framework to guide policy and regulatory decision making. You presented the key concepts in the report for discussion with CST members, which helped to frame thinking on advice to the Prime Minister*” \(5.1, p. 1\). 

 The Government’s response was *“unusually quick and robust”* \(5.1, p. 2\): Greg Clark, then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, responded on 12<sup>th</sup> October 2018 \(5.3\), confirming the government’s intention to implement these recommendations. The resulting White Paper on *Regulation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution* \(5.4\) commits the UK Government to the following: 

1.  Establishing a Regulatory Horizons Council to do horizon\-scanning work and recommend priorities for regulatory reform to the Ministerial Working Group on Future Regulation \(5.4 pp. 11\-13\) to which Tait was subsequently appointed and asked to take the lead role in advising Government on the future regulation of genomic technologies \(5.5\). 

1.  Improving use of regulatory guidance, codes of practice and industry standards, including piloting an innovation test to consider impact of legislation on innovation alongside working with bodies such as the BSI to review the use of standards \(5.4, pp. 17\-18\); 

1.  Consulting on a digital Regulation Navigator for businesses to understand UK regulation, funding for specialist regulatory advisor services, encourage co\-ordination between regulators \(5.4, pp. 23\-25\). 

1.  Supporting experimentation through considering an extension of the £10M Regulators’ Pioneer Fund, establishing a Regulators’ Innovation Network \(5.4, pp. 19\-22\). 

 CST noted that *“This would not have happened without your \(Tait’s\) strong involvement in helping to develop recommendations and making yourself available to guide officials to bring these ideas to life”* \(5.1, p. 2\). The PAGIT Report is referenced in the White paper \(5.4, p. 17\) and many of its central ideas are evident, such as the flexible approach to regulation, consideration of how regulation can inhibit innovation, support to innovators, and the use of standards as alternatives to regulation \(5.4, pp.17\-18\). 

 The White Paper has been welcomed by Lord Willetts in a recent report ‘The Road to 2.4 per cent’ \(5.6, pp. 59\-60\), as important in enabling the UK to meet its commitment to spending 2.4% of GDP on research and development by 2027, and is discussed in the Better Regulation Annual Report \(5.7, pp. 7\-8\) *.* 

 A standard for Responsible Innovation 

 In response to the recommendation to develop a standard for responsible innovation, Innovate UK provided the necessary funding to the BSI and they commissioned Tait as Technical Author of the standard, a Publicly Available Specification \(PAS\). Development of the PAS involved: a survey of over 40 advanced technology companies to assess demand for such a standard; and four rounds of drafting, commenting and revision, the last two rounds involving a Steering Group \(including technology\-based companies, academic representatives, international agencies and policy bodies\), and an open public consultation. 

 PAS 440 *Responsible Innovation – Guide* \(5.8\) was published in April 2020 and was downloaded from the BSI website over 1,000 times during the first 24 hours after the launch, a higher number than for any other standard launched by BSI \(5.9\).This take up indicates strong potential for the wider adoption across the sector as a full, accredited British Standard, and as part of the UK input to a European or International Standard. The Director of Standards Policy at the BSI writes that *“Professor Joyce Tait, and research that she had undertaken over the course of the past four years, has played a central role in informing BSI’s thinking on the use of standards to design more adaptive and proportionate governance systems for innovate technologies’* and that ‘ *contribution made by Prof Tait and the Innogen Institute both to BSI and to government policy formation has been extremely valuable”* \(5.10\). *T*he Director of Responsible programmes in Innovate UK suggested that, *“Our view is that technologies are neither inherently good, nor inherently bad. It is how they are deployed that is important. Joyce made invaluable input as we sought to design and implement processes that would ensure that companies taking new and emerging technologies to market, in areas such as synthetic biology, did so in a responsible manner”* \(5.9\).

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Led by Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama \(RWCMD\) Head of Composition John Hardy, John Hardy Music \(JHM\), which provides disciplinary opportunities for staff and students, was commissioned to write, perform and record the soundtrack for two bilingual TV series: *Y Gwyll* \(‘Hinterland’\- first broadcast in Welsh on S4C in October 2013\) and *Craith* \(‘Hidden’ – S4C 2018\).  Both series have fulfilled the commitment made in April 2013 by Rhodri Talfan Davies, Director of BBC Cymru Wales, to increase the mainstream representation of Welsh culture.  ‘Hinterland’ was produced by the Fiction Factory with major funding from BBC Cymru Wales and S4C, and global distribution from All3Media.  ‘Hidden’ was produced by Severn Screen with financial support and co\-production involvement from BBC Cymru Wales, S4C, BBC 4 and All3Media.  Informed by John Hardy’s research, the group’s innovative, improvisatory approach to composition and performance in real time enabled high\-quality content to be delivered to budget and contributed significantly to the world\-wide success of both series as measured by size of audience \( *Y Gwyll* was viewed 4.93m times in its first broadcast, and eventually streamed globally by Netflix\), viewer ratings \(IMDb median score of 8/10 for both series\), and number of industry awards, including between them 9 Welsh BAFTAs. Additionally, the work of early\-career practitioners on these projects has enhanced their employability in the creative industries.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 John Hardy Music \(JHM\) is a team of composers, sound engineers and multi\-instrumentalists based in Cardiff and led by John Hardy, Head of Composition at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. JHM works closely with directors, producers, film makers, choreographers and other artists to compose bespoke music that reinforces emotion and encapsulates story.  John Hardy has been firmly established over the last thirty years as one of the leading composers of music for film, television and theatre in Wales, and has composed soundtracks for previous bilingual productions such as *A Mind to Kill,* series 3 and 4, 2001\-2002 \[3\], and also for several episodes of flagship BBC One arts show *Imagine*, initially in 2009 for *The Year of Anish Kapoor*, which was later shown at the 29th the International Festival of Films on Art in Montreal, Canada in 2011 \[4\]. 

  

 In 2012, JHM was approached by the Cardiff\-based production company Fiction Factory to work on a projected 8\-part TV crime drama, *Y Gwyll* \(‘Hinterland’\), which would be first broadcast on S4C in October 2013 \[1\]. The series would be set in west Wales—a hinterland rich in history and myth—and be shot in Welsh and English for broadcast by S4C, BBC Wales and BBC4. In the event, the series achieved world\-wide distribution via 11 national TV companies and Netflix \(see Details of the impact\). 

 Both budget \(GBP4.2m\) and timescale \(6 months\) were extremely tight for a project of this size. The requirement was for nearly 8 hours of music \(4 standalone feature\-length films, each split into 2 episodes\) to support the script and production values of a crime drama positioned competitively within the successful ‘Scandi\-noir’ genre that had become so popular with British audiences. The music had to underpin a quasi\-mythical treatment of the Welsh landscape – timeless, misty when not windswept, sometimes dreary, cold and overcast – and at the same time convey the hard cutting edge of a contemporary police procedural. Each film would have its own texture and feel within an overall unified visual and musical language. 

 In tackling this demanding brief, John Hardy and his team produced an outstanding example of practice\-based research, in which an unusually intense process of collaboration resulted in the blurring of traditionally defined roles.  Their intervention has been timely: As the technological options available to composers have proliferated, academic interest in the collaborative production of music for film and TV has also risen.  This academic research is sometimes framed around the concept of individuals holding responsibility for distinct parts of the process \(Cooper, D \(2018\) ‘Creative Practices and Technical Processes in Music for Cinema and Television’, in Donin, N \(ed.\) *The Oxford Handbook of the Creative Process in Music*.  Available at: DOI: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190636197.013.26\).  Working with two recent graduates of the RWCMD, Victoria \(‘Tic’\) Ashfield and Benjamin Talbott, Hardy’s approach was to dispense with the conventional written score and re\-engage on 21<sup>st</sup>\-century terms with two techniques drawn from earlier treatments of music drama: real\-time improvisation, characteristic of the silent film; and the *leitmotif*, here extended to include location, situation and mood as well as character.  Through the use of the historically grounded method of improvising to the moving image, and through encouraging each member of the team to contribute to every part of the process, Hardy found a scheme that allowed not only for invigorating artistry, but also speed and efficiency through the entire production process. 

 Between them, the three team members brought a broad range of skills, both instrumental \(piano, harmonium, violin, cello, guitar, bass guitar, percussion and synths\) and technical \(specialist recording and mixing techniques and sophisticated sound manipulation\). From these resources Hardy developed a palette of musical motifs—not just melodic cells, but harmony, timbre, sampled and synthesised sounds—and a suite of recording techniques, including very close microphones to capture the naked, grainy quality of the sound world. The group then used these materials, plus Hardy’s own title music, as a common language from which they improvised the entire soundtrack in front of the video monitors.  Because everyone attended all the cutting room briefings, each member of the team was fully informed and ready to work on any aspect of the project as required. This was especially useful when schedules and budgets continually shifted and slipped: flexibility and ability to close ranks and respond creatively without delay was tactically crucial and strategically achievable. 

 The resulting series was so successful that a two\-part ‘special’ and two further series of 8 episodes were commissioned, using the same writers and production team, including JHM. Upon completion of ‘Hinterland’ in 2016, JHM was commissioned by BBC Wales and S4C to provide the soundtrack for a new Welsh and English bilingual serial called *Craith* \(‘Hidden’\), set in north Wales, and first broadcast in 2018 \[2\]. To date, two series of 8 and 6 episodes have aired. Together with other subsequent commissions, *Craith* has enabled JHM to develop further the research into contemporary improvisatory composition that began with *Y Gwyll*. This new project has brought a wider range of musicians and sound technicians into the team, extending their technical capacity and equipping them with new skills in support of the creative industries in Wales.  Both projects form part of the REF2 submission for the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.

 JHM made a signification contribution to the artistic and commercial success of *Y Gwyll* \(‘Hinterland’\) and *Craith* \(‘Hidden’\). Both series reflect the commitment made in April 2013 by Rhodri Talfan Davies, then Director of BBC Cymru Wales, now BBC Director of Nations, to show more Welsh language, life and culture on the main BBC channels. 

 Looking back at the creative impact of John Hardy’s music within *Y Gwyll* and *Craith*, Rhodri Talfan Davies described the musical contribution to the overall feel of both productions as “simply indispensable”. John Hardy’s music, he added “was not merely incidental but intrinsic to both productions in helping to bring alive a range of cinematic landscapes and emotionally challenging scenarios” \[R1\]. 

  

 Rhodri Talfan Davies also emphasised the legacy of both productions for the creative economy of Wales. “It’s unarguable”, he noted, “that these productions have made the rest of the UK and the World sit up and take notice of Wales as not only a place to base productions within but also as a place where we have great stories to tell and on our terms” \[R1\].  Reviews of the music for *Y Gwyll* include: “a haunting soundtrack” \( *Guardian*\), and “surely one of the loveliest soundtracks to grace a crime drama” \( *Radio Times*\). The music for *Craith* has been described as “an ominous, skin\-prickling soundtrack skilfully employed to heighten the sense of dread” \( *Guardian*\) \[R8\]. 

  

 *Y Gwyll* \(‘Hinterland’\) was first broadcast in Welsh on S4C in October 2013. The series met with great acclaim and viewing figures were very strong, with a total of 4.93m viewings and an average audience per episode of 616,250. This figure represents an impressive 72% of the total potential audience of Welsh speakers \(n=855,200\) \[R4\]. 

 The bilingual version \(not all actors spoke Welsh, so some scenes were shot in Welsh with English subtitles and others in English with Welsh subtitles\) was then shown on BBC Wales from January 2014. Finally, the bilingual version was shown again on BBC4, the corporation’s go\-to channel for international drama, from April 2014. The series won 3 Welsh BAFTAs in 2014 with 6 other nominations \[R6\] and was nominated in the outstanding actor category for the Monte\-Carlo Television Festival and the craft and design category for the Royal Television Society Awards \[R7\]. 

 The success of the series generated two kinds of take\-up, nationally and internationally. A one\-off special and two further series aired in January and September\-November 2015, and in October\-December 2016, each with average audiences per episode of 543,750 and 641,250 respectively. BBC4 gave the show the strongest possible endorsement by scheduling it on Saturday evenings immediately after the final series of *The Bridge*. IMDb viewer ratings \(n=9,906\) average 7.8/10 with a median score of 8/10 \[R4, R5\]. 

 International take\-up was equally strong. Danmarks Radio \(producers of *The Killing*\) bought the show from the outset, before filming commenced and 10 other European national broadcasters \(Belgium, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden, Netherlands, France and Ireland\) have aired it, usually in the bilingual version, and two have entered into the spirit of the series by dubbing the Welsh into Flemish or Breton. The series is now streamed world\-wide by Netflix \(182.8m subscribers\). 

 Among the most significant consequences for the Welsh TV industry in particular was a new project for which JHM again provided the soundtrack: the bilingual serial *Craith* \(‘Hidden’\), commissioned by Severn Screen for broadcast in 2018 \(again, on SC4 first, then BBC Wales followed by BBC4\) with a second series in 2019. Viewing figures for series 1 were an average of 443,750 per episode in Welsh and 738,750 bilingual; and for series 2, 413,333 and 540,000 respectively. IMDb ratings \(n=2,585\) are an average of 7.4/10 and a median score of 8 \[R4, R5\]. The series won a Welsh BAFTA in 2018 with 4 further nominations \[R6\] and was nominated in the best photography: drama category for the Royal Television Society Awards. A third series is planned. The success of *Y Gwyll* and *Craith* also created the conditions for two more very successful Welsh\-language dramas, *Requiem* and *Keeping Faith*. 

 The creative industries sector is one of the fastest growing in Wales, with an annual turnover in excess of £3.5bn \[ [Komorowski, M and Lewis, J \(2020\)](https://clwstwr.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-05/Clwstwr%20Creative%20Industries%20Report%20No%201.pdf) *The Size and Composition of the Creative Industries in Wales*\].  Immediately prior to the onset of COVID\-19 Welsh creative industries employed some 80,000 people, with 98% of these being small and micro businesses. The sectors in which JHM’s work has had its greatest impact include film, TV and the performing arts, sectors that employ over 15,000 people across Wales. 

 The success of these creative industries depends upon a highly skilled workforce, and JHM has made a significant impact in this area. Aside from generating skilled work for musicians and music technicians, JHM has provided many career development opportunities for graduate students. Benjamin Talbott and ‘Tic’ Ashfield have both become highly respected and established composers in films, TV dramas, documentaries, as well as in theatre and dance. In 2016 they were awarded the Welsh BAFTA ‘Best Original Music Score’ for their joint work on the Welsh/Argentinian art movie *Galesa* \[R6\]. 

 Talbott has also composed music for a number of niche action film dramas \[R2\] and Ashfield has gone on to create the music for several educational animation films, radio dramas, theatre performances, dance projects and education projects, including music for games production company Frantic Assembly and music and sound design for five Sherman Cymru plays \[R3\]. 

 Talbott has written, “I am proud to have composed for John Hardy Music in a variety of capacities, leading on some and collaborating on others. As always, all projects at JHM are true collaborations, and the music would never turn out to be what it is without all of the composers’ inputs. Working with others to create something greater than what each of you could imagine alone is perhaps one of the most exciting things in life, and certainly so when making music” \[R2\].

 **Summary of Impact** 

 Professor Scraton’s leadership, management, and direction of the Hillsborough Independent Panel \(HIP\) research team and his primary authorship of the HIP Report was submitted as a QUB REF 2014 Impact Case Study. Since 2014, Professor Scraton’s continuing, in\-depth research into the Hillsborough disaster, accumulated over three decades and involving work with bereaved families, survivors and their legal teams, has had a direct and material impact. First, as consultant to the families’ legal teams throughout the inquests into the Hillsborough disaster \(2014\-2016\), his research informed their examination of witnesses throughout the legal hearings, the exoneration of those who died, the verdict of unlawful killing and the jury’s detailed findings against all public agencies involved. Second, through extensive media engagement his research uniquely shaped public understanding of the tragedy’s context and consequences, throughout and beyond the inquests. Third, his Hillsborough research is a significant resource for lawyers, activists, and NGOs as a model advocating for reform in the conduct of public inquiries and inquests into controversial deaths. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **Overview** 

 Professor Scraton has an established, international reputation researching official inquiries, investigations, and inquests into controversial deaths **\[R1\]**. His in\-depth Hillsborough research – interrogating context, circumstances, and aftermath – exposed institutionalised flaws in police, coronial, government and media responses to avoidable loss of life and severe physical and psychological injury **\[R2, R3, R5\]**. The HIP Report **\[R4\]** was research\-led and written by Scraton. Subsequently, his research received a Home Office grant \(2014\-2016: £157,181\) and a Leverhulme Trust Fellowship award \(2017\-present: £17,285\), focusing on the Hillsborough Inquests and subsequent legal processes. Seconded as a researcher to support the families and their legal teams \(2014\-2016\) his new research, detailing the Panel’s work and the new inquests, culminated in a revised edition of his ground\-breaking, *Hillsborough: The Truth* \(2016\) **\[R6\]**. 

 Scraton’s qualitative research with bereaved families and survivors is underpinned by exhaustive documentary and policy analysis, contrasting official discourse regarding the disaster’s context and circumstances with an authoritative ‘view from below’. His extensive published research revealed: insufficient analysis of inherent dangers and foreseeable risk; corruption of police statements; compromised investigations including medical/ pathological evidence; systemic failure in the coronial process. Scraton’s research was central to establishing the irrefutable case for reopening criminal and Independent Office for Police Conduct Investigations \(2013\-ongoing\) and new inquests **\[R3, R4\]**. His continued contribution, as research consultant throughout the inquests, had a direct and material impact on their conduct and outcome **\[R6\]**. His research continues to be an invaluable resource for others seeking to learn and apply the lessons of the Hillsborough experience.

 4. **Details of the Impact** 

 The context in which 96 women, men and children were killed, 766 injured and thousands traumatised, at a Hillsborough Stadium FA Cup Semi\-Final in April 1989 is well documented and internationally recognised. Within hours of the tragedy, police representatives and politicians had briefed international media that drunken, violent fans had caused fatalities. A judicial inquiry found serious institutional negligence in managing the capacity crowd, yet no criminal prosecutions resulted. Inquests were held in 1990\-91. The families received no legal aid for those inquests. The coroner directed the jury towards an accidental death verdict, returned by a majority. A 1993 judicial review of the verdict failed in the High Court. It exonerated the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and the emergency services and remained the official ‘truth’ about Hillsborough for over two decades. Denied legitimacy, survivors criticised the parlous state of the stadium, inadequate stewarding and policing, emergency response failures, and flawed investigations. In 2010 the HIP was established and its 400\-page report meticulously documented these failings, the negative media coverage and failures in the legal processes \(including the original inquests\) and subsequent reviews. Professor Scraton’s leadership, management and direction of the HIP research team and primary authorship of its Report was submitted as a REF QUB 2014 Impact Case Study. This REF Impact Case Study details the subsequent impact of his research. 

 **The Second Inquests, 2014\-2016** 

 Following the HIP findings **\[R4\]**, the accidental death inquest verdicts were quashed. The Lord Chief Justice ordered new inquests. Scraton was appointed research consultant to the families’ legal teams \(103 families/ individuals represented by 14 firms of solicitors; 31 barristers at a cost to legal aid of GBP63,600,000\). Throughout the five preliminary hearings and two\-year inquests \(2014\-16\), the longest running inquests in British legal history, his research had a direct and material impact on the conduct of the legal hearings. Scraton was seconded to the bereaved families’ legal teams: drafted submissions to the Coroner throughout preliminary hearings \(2013\-2014\); and also wrote thirty comprehensive background papers informing presentation of the case, including detailed appraisal of witness evidence \(2014\-2016\). 

 The Hillsborough Research Archive compiled under his direction and housed at Queen’s University Belfast, was key to informing team briefings and the focus, presentation and interrogation of evidence **\[R1\]**. Deploying an academic research archive in live proceedings, prioritising and challenging evidence, was a unique development in UK legal history. A senior barrister who represented the families, now a Coroner, summed up Scraton’ s impact on the inquests thus: *‘His very species\-being was invested, emotionally and intellectually … This was manifest … in the laser like focus on the detail that mattered for the conduct of the 96 fresh inquests themselves.  He produced some 30 briefing papers that were utterly invaluable in, repeatedly, drawing the lawyers’ perspective and clarity back to the process of ensuring that accountability and truth were drawn to the fore\-front of the evidence that the court and the jury were required to consider, and drawing out the details that informed the humanity behind the sheer numbers killed and forever damaged.  This, I suspect as much as anything, enabled the conclusions of the 96 inquests to emerge as they did: confirming that 96 men, women and children were unlawfully killed and, critically, exposing and destroying once and for all the malevolent strategies, the lies, that sought to blame the victims for their own fate’* **\[Source A\]**. 

 Another Senior Counsel, who acted for 77 Hillsborough families, similarly assessed Scraton’s contribution as: ‘ *His written and oral contributions were informed by an encyclopaedic knowledge of the events of the day...He “coloured in” the black and white of the words and images…Phil provided a bridge to the families as well as to the work of the HIP panel*.’ **\[Source B\]**. 

 Consistent with Scraton’s research findings **\[R6\]**, the unanimous jury verdict delivered in April 2016 was unlawful killing. Further, the jury found multiple systemic failings by the South Yorkshire Police, the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Hillsborough stadium’s engineers. It exonerated the Liverpool fans, including those killed and injured, of any responsibility. The following day in the House of Commons the then UK Home Secretary Theresa May stated: 

 ‘*Clearly, the jury’s determination that those who died were unlawfully killed is of great public importance. It overturns in the starkest way possible the verdict of accidental death returned at the original inquests. Thanks to \[the HIP report\] and now the determinations of the inquests, we know the truth of what happened on that day at Hillsborough...this raises significant issues for the way the State and its agencies deal with disasters. Once formal investigations are concluded, we should step back, reflect and act \[to\] better respond to disasters and ensure that the suffering of families is taken into account. For 27 years the families and survivors of Hillsborough have fought for justice. They have faced hostility, opposition and obfuscation, and the authorities that should have been trusted, have laid blame and tried to protect themselves instead of acting in the public interest. But the families have never faltered in their pursuit of the truth. Thanks to their actions, they have brought about a proper reinvestigation, and a thorough re\-evaluation of what happened at Hillsborough  \[Source C\]**. 

 In July 2016, in remarks to coincide with the launch of the 4<sup>th</sup> edition of Scraton’s book *Hillsborough: The Truth*, the then Labour Shadow Home Secretary and Culture Secretary Andy Burnham, commented: ‘ *Of this I am sure* *the full truth about Hillsborough would never have been known were it not for his meticulous efforts over many years, turning over stones that others have walked past Professor Scraton has done a huge service not just to the Hillsborough families, but to this country’*  **\[Source D\]**. 

 In September 2016, alongside posthumous awards to the 96 who died, Professor Scraton, Sir Kenny and Marina Dalglish were awarded the Freedom of the City of Liverpool in recognition of their contribution to the truth finally being established as a result of the inquest findings. The then Lord Mayor stated: *‘The Hillsborough campaign was a long, heart breaking journey for all involved. It seemed fitting that after the latest inquests brought the families the truth and justice outcome that they had fought so hard for, we mark this monumental moment by awarding the 96, and those outstanding individuals who have given them their support, with the city’s highest honour’* **\[Source E\]**. 

 **Contribution to the Public Understanding of Truth Regarding Hillsborough ** 

 Prof Scraton’s research has made a seminal contribution to shaping public understanding of what happened at Hillsborough and the subsequent inquiries, investigations and inquests. The reach of his research is evidenced by the breadth and diversity of his Hillsborough related media work. On Hillsborough alone, between 2014–2020, Professor Scraton was interviewed, referenced or quoted on 258 occasions in print, broadcast and online media. 

 For example, in print, he has appeared in the *Daily Mail* \(28 Nov 2019, 16 Nov 2017 & 28 June 2017 \- circulation of 960,000 and 24,900,000 unique online visitors/month\); *The Times* 9<sup>th</sup> May 2016 \(circulation of 400,000 and 300,000 online subscribers\); *The Daily Telegraph* \(29<sup>th</sup> December 2016, 27<sup>th</sup> October 2017 \- circulation 317,000, 460,000 on\-line subscribers\);  *The Guardian* \(28<sup>th</sup>  April 2016 *,* 21<sup>st</sup> February 2017 \- circulation 125,000 and 85,000,000 global monthly website users\); *The Daily Mirror* \(25<sup>th</sup> May 2016, 29<sup>th</sup> December 2016, 1<sup>st</sup> November 2017 \- circulation of 366,000 and 25,000,000 unique visitors/month\); *The Irish Times* \(13<sup>th</sup> May 2016, 17<sup>th</sup> August 2017, 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2019 \- circulation of 79,000 and 10,800,000 monthly online users\); the *Belfast Telegraph* \(29<sup>th</sup> Dec 2016, 15<sup>th</sup> May 2017, 6<sup>th</sup> Nov 2017 \- circulation 31,000 with 3,400,000 monthly users\); *Liverpool Echo,* 42 separate occasions \(circulation 26,000\). He has also appeared in the international print media including in the *New York Times* \(15 April 2014 & 12 April 2014 \- circulation 850,000, 4,700,000 digital subscribers\) and the *Australian Daily Telegraph* 31<sup>st</sup> October 2016 \(circulation 1,191,000, 3,440,000 digital readers\). Online, Phil Scraton was referenced on the BBC news website on 12 occasions, 2014\-2020 \(the world’s most visited News website with 179,000,000 unique monthly visitors\) and the Argentinian news website Infobae \(15 Apr 2019 – 38,000,000 unique monthly visitors\) and on CNN.com \(26 Apr 2016, 147,000,000 unique visitors/month\). On 1<sup>st</sup> December 2016 the *Times Higher* published an unprecedented 8\-page, cover story on Scraton’s research in securing justice for the Hillsborough families \(380,000 on\-line readers\). 

 Between 2014 and 2020 he has given over 70 local and national radio and television interviews on Hillsborough related matters. For example, he has been interviewed on the *BBC Radio 4* programmes *PM* \(28 June 2017 – 4,200,000 listeners weekly\) and *Today* \(30 December 2016 & 9 January 2015 – 6,720,000 listeners weekly\) as well as *Radio 5 Live* \(12 times \- total reach of 4,980,000 listeners/week\). He has been interviewed on *BBC News at 10* \(28 June 2017, 4,200,000 viewers per episode\) and *Channel 4 News* \(28 June 2017, 1,300,000 viewers per episode\). 

 He was research consultant for and primary participant in the *BBC/CNN* film *Hillsborough* \(2016\) screened across Europe, Australia, Latin America, the USA and Canada. Short\-listed for an Emmy, the film won the 2017 Best Documentary BAFTA. At the awards ceremony, February 2017, the film’s Director Dan Gordon stated: ‘ *I thank Professor Phil Scraton, who is standing right behind me, who has worked so tirelessly, diligently … and shown a dogged determination to expose the full truth of Hillsborough. I am in absolute awe of you*’ **\[Source F\]**. Scraton was research consultant for the *S4C* documentary, **Hillsborough: Yr Hunllef Hir** \(The Long Nightmare\), awarded the 2017 Celtic Media Festival main prize. He was consultant and interviewee for the 2017 film documentary *Kenny* on the impact of Hillsborough on the former Liverpool manager Sir Kenny Dalglish. 

 As the North West Correspondent for BBC News states in a letter to the UoA, *‘I cover the subject of the disaster and its aftermath closely for national BBC news programmes. I have interviewed Prof Scraton many times, and also speak to him regularly off\-air, for advice on developments in the story. In my estimation Professor Scraton is a world authority on the labyrinthine subject of Hillsborough … Myself and my colleagues often approach him for interviews, and are grateful for the time he gives us. He gives important context to our reports, and puts a priority on being able to explain complex findings in an accessible way. This has ensured that his research isn’t solely the preserve of academia, but has travelled far beyond the university campus to newspaper readers and television and radio audiences.* **\[Source G\]**. 

 The impact of Scraton’s contribution to public discourse was well illustrated by the former *Radio 4 Desert Island Disc* host Kirsty Young, introducing him as a ‘castaway’ on 5th November 2017 \(2,900,000 listeners/ episode\): ‘ *at the heart of much of his life and work has been the Hillsborough Disaster … My guest’s relentless and meticulous quest for the truth has been fundamental to our understanding as to what really went wrong*’ **\[Source H\]**.  In the New Year’s Honours List, December 2016 he was offered an OBE in recognition for his research and advocacy on Hillsborough. He declined the award. 

 Between January 2017 and February 2020 Scraton delivered c.60 visiting lectures and conference plenaries to over 12,000 academic, professional and public audiences \(in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany\), together with numerous webinars, on Hillsborough and its implications for truth recovery, state power and researching deaths in contested circumstances. Endorsing *Hillsborough: The Truth,* David Downes, Professor Emeritus at the LSE commented on his research and research dissemination strategy as being characterised by ‘ *a tireless determination to uncover the truth; a unique example, accumulating evidence and grounding analysis in so masterly a fashion, reactivating better informed public debate and making a compelling case to release a mass of undisclosed police and official document*’ **\[Source I\]**. 

 **The Continuing, Wider Significance of the Hillsborough Research ** 

 The high profile of Professor Scraton’s research and its significance in reopening investigations and inquiries, revealing the precise circumstances of the Hillsborough disaster, and the lessons learnt, underpins more recent research in other contexts. For example, the legal team representing families bereaved by the Stardust Fire in Dublin 1981 \(in which 48 people died\) have drawn directly on his Hillsborough experience and expertise in securing new inquests to reassess causation, originally and erroneously considered to be arson **\[Source J\]**. His Hillsborough research was the reason he was appointed to the JUSTICE working party into inquest and public inquiry reform, published in August 2020. Its membership included Sir John Golding QC, the Hillsborough inquest coroner. Its recommendations on the treatment of families, drew directly on the Hillsborough research, to ensure that the pain and suffering experienced by the Hillsborough families would not be repeated **\[Source K\]**. Drawing directly on his Hillsborough related research, in 2018 he co\-facilitated a funded six\-week research workshop at the University of Sydney into deaths in contested circumstances. In 2019 he was appointed by the Irish Council of Civil Liberties to conduct a comprehensive review of the Irish Coronial System, funded by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission \(2019\-2021\). It focuses on the issues central to Scraton’s Hillsborough research: c **oronial independence; legal aid and legal representation for families at inquests; families’ access to investigation reports; the role of juries; and narrative verdicts.**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Vladimir Getov’s pioneering research on message passing for Java \(MPJ\) provided a crucially important framework and programming environment for parallel and distributed computing with Java. This invention resulted in an industry standard specification and a novel MPJ\-based hierarchical development methodology for a new generation of large\-scale grid and cloud\-based distributed systems. These achievements led to: 

-  *Impact on Professional Practice*: Getov’s MPJ specification provided the foundations for the Java binding in Open MPI \(message passing interface\) – the most popular worldwide open\-source library, which provides easy access to this binding for application programmers. 

-  *Economic Impacts*: IBM’s biometric identification system, built in collaboration with Getov and using the MPJ framework, has had significant economic impact for IBM via the quicker return of investment achieved by its higher productivity and shorter development cycle. The adoption of Getov’s MPJ development methodology by ActiveEon has also seen the company demonstrate significant revenue growth \(18M USD across the REF period\). 

-  *Social Impacts*: IBM Watson’s development was based on Getov’s component composition message passing approach and has demonstrable benefits in the areas of social services, environmental protection, and public safety. ActiveEon’s use of Getov’s MPJ development methodology in their ProActive workflow and scheduling framework has had significant benefits in biomedical distributed applications.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Released in 1995, the Java programming language was rapidly adopted by industry and end users because of its portability and internet programming support. However, Java did not have the symmetric message passing capability, widely recognised as vitally important for parallel and distributed memory computing. By contrast, efficient message passing support had already been captured in the MPI standard for other programming languages such as C, C\+\+, and Fortran. 

 Professor Vladimir Getov identified this weakness and conducted pioneering research and development on MPJ which has been a main area of focus for the Distributed and Intelligent Systems Research Group \(DIS RG\) at the University of Westminster since the late 90s. This research team comprises: Professor V. Getov, Dr A. Bolotov, Dr S. Isaiadis, Dr S. Minchev, Dr T. Weigold, Dr A. Basukoski, Dr J. Thiyagalingam, and Dr A. Basso. The early success of DIS RG attracted high international interest and the creation of the International MPJ Working Group with participation from the UK, USA, Europe, and Japan. 

 Chaired by Vladimir Getov, the MPJ Working Group developed a methodology for building mixed\-language MPJ applications which evolved from three approaches: \(a\) wrapping of existing MPI libraries via hand\-written software; \(b\) automatic code generation of the wrapper interface by a novel tool\-generator; and \(c\) development from scratch of the MPI libraries in Java. Getov has participated in the development of all three approaches by implementing the MPJ specification and ensuring full compatibility with the already existing and very successful MPI standard. The **MPJ results successfully resembled MPI, providing symmetric message passing for distributed computing with Java** leading to its adoption by the professional community \[1\]. 

 This working group was then invited to join the Global Grid Forum \(an international professional organisation focusing on grid and cloud computing\) where Getov furthered this research by expanding the application of MPJ into modern large\-scale distributed systems such as grids and clouds, both of which allow for the analysis of huge data sets. Tackling the scalability and productivity challenges, Getov and colleagues formally specified building blocks called “components” and **introduced component\-based approaches that enabled MPJ to provide the interconnection mechanisms in complex grid and cloud systems** \[2\]. 

 Continuing work in this area, the next main research challenge was to replace the Common Component Architecture \(CCA\) model. Available in early 2000, the CCA provided only limited support for a single coupling of components in a 2\-dimensional space. Getov’s innovation was to develop a novel abstract approach for hierarchical \(multiple\) composition of components in a 3\-dimensional space. Further, Getov invented a novel MPJ\-based hierarchical components composition development methodology for a new generation of large\-scale grid and cloud\-based distributed systems. This provided the theoretical background for a recursive and efficient component\-based development methodology. The combination of these research contributions to the European  [CoreGRID](http://coregrid.ercim.eu/mambo/) project significantly advanced this new field through Getov’s **development of the hierarchical Grid Component Model \(GCM\) specification for various distributed computing systems** \[3\]. Together with his DIS RG team, Getov followed up the GCM specification with proof\-of\-concept experiments in a development environment that used the hierarchical components MPJ methodology and provided confidence about the higher efficiency of this novel approach \[4\]. 

 Building on this work, the DIS RG team, led by Getov, was a main partner in the European  [GridComp](http://gridcomp.ercim.eu/) project. Working in close collaboration with other partners including INRIA Sophia Antipolis \(France\), IBM\-Research \(Switzerland\), Atos Origin \(Spain\), University of Pisa \(Italy\), and Tsinghua University \(China\), the GridComp project designed and built a fully functional platform incorporating the ICBE \(Integrated Component\-Based Environment\) prototype for hierarchical components composition \[5\]. A major contribution of GridComp was **the design and implementation of a component based MPJ framework for rapid development and deployment of efficient grid and cloud computing applications**. This work led to **four new international standards**, approved by ETSI \(European Telecommunications Standards Institute\): ""GCM Interoperability Deployment"", Aug 2008; ""GCM Interoperability Application Description"", Aug 2008; “GCM Fractal ADL”, Mar 2009; “GCM Management API \(Java, C, WSDL\)”, Mar 2010. 

 Further results on smart cloud architectures followed the expanded ICBE methodology, which included **three approaches for developing GCM applications** \[6\]. Getov contributed significantly to each: The first, a wrapper approach for legacy codes reuse, supports both hand\-written and automatically generated code. The second approach componentises existing applications via appropriate modifications. The third approach is component\-based development from scratch. This work confirmed **the significantly higher productivity of the component\-based MPJ development methodology**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  Impact 1: Professional Practice \- Open Source and Standardisation 

 Since August 2014, the MPJ specification has been included in the core distribution of the widely used Open MPI \(Open\-Source Message Passing Interface\) software environment. Developed and maintained by a consortium of research, academic, and industry partners, Open MPI is a suite of open\-source software libraries implementing the MPI standard for High Performance Computing \(HPC\) \[a\-i\]. The Java binding developed in Open MPI is based on the ground\-breaking results of the International MPJ Working Group chaired by Vladimir Getov \(output \[1\]\) and incorporate the four ETSI standards that resulted from the GridComp project \(outputs \[4\], \[5\] and \[6\]\). The Open MPI team have highlighted that these **‘standardized classes’ of Java are of benefit to an open\-source library** as they ‘provide a platform\-independent way to access host\-specific features such as threads, graphics, file management, and networking’ \[a\-ii, p.4 & 2\]. In other words, these standardised classes guarantee full compatibility and portability across a wide variety of platforms and applications. 

 In recent years, Open MPI has become the most popular MPI library, as is evidenced by the MPI International Survey, which received over 800 user responses from 42 different countries between Feb & July 2019 \[a\-iii, p.1\]. Of the MPI users identified, 85.8% \(718 respondents\) use Open MPI \[a\-iv\]. As such, **through its inclusion in this open\-source library, MPJ has been reaching a wide range of users**, 80% of which belong to non\-profit organisations, including government institutes, as well as software and hardware vendors, with the use of Java being especially popular in the UK and Russia \[a\-i, p.13 & 16\]. 

 Regarding the significance of this wide range of users, the Open MPI team explain that MPJ was added as it is one of the three key parallel computing technologies upon which HPC depends and has several benefits. For instance, it ‘provides efficient built\-in support for threads’ which increases the software development productivity. In addition, ‘some numerical libraries are based on multithreading’ and MPI itself ‘can benefit from Java because its widespread use makes it likely to find new uses beyond traditional HPC applications’ \[a\-ii, p.1\-2\]. As such **the primary impact on professional practice relates to providing easy access to Java binding for programmers** who can exploit these benefits \(output \[2\]\). Secondary impacts arise through specific examples of such usage of MPJ via Open MPI. For instance, the PPF library for parallel particle filtering applications allows application programmers to write quickly and easily shared\- and distributed\-memory PPF codes in Java \[a\-v\], producing the benefit of ‘ **reducing the cost of traditional particle filters** by approximating the likelihood with a mixture of uniform distributions over pre\-defined cells or bins.’ 

#  Impact 2. Economic Impact 

 An example of the significant economic impact on users of Prof Getov’s innovative component based MPJ development methodology is its contribution to ‘the long\-term research and development collaboration for IBM’s Cloud Computing agenda and strategy’, through knowledge exchange activities at IBM Research Centers in Zurich, Almaden, Watson, and Dublin, as well as direct collaborative research \[b\]. Dr Peter Buhler, Head of Computer Science at the Zurich Laboratory states that this has resulted in their ‘using and developing further the adopted component\-based methodology and development platform which has \[in turn\] influenced the professional practice in building complex applications for grid and cloud systems’ at IBM \[b\]. 

 For instance, Buhler \[b\] confirms that **IBM Watson** was ‘designed by reusing the principles developed and standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute as part of Vladimir Getov’s work’ \(output \[5\]\). This supercomputer is a unique artificial intelligence system capable of answering questions posed in natural language and its economic significance to IBM is indicated by its global market share of 16.1% placing it amongst the three dominant systems in the Machine Learning category \[d\-i\]. IBM Watson has been used by nearly 2,800 companies as of July 2020 due to its usefulness across a variety of application domains. Statistics by revenue show that 39% of Watson users are large companies \(>$1000M\), 37% are small \(<$50M\), and 16% are medium\-sized, and that they cut across different sectors of industry – the largest being Computer Software \(22%\), Hospital & Health Care \(14%\), Higher Education \(8%\), and Information Technology and Services \(7%\) \[d\-i\]. 

 Buhler also cites **‘the Biometric Identification System application** developed in collaboration with Vladimir’s DIS RG team and delivered by IBM Research – Zurich Laboratory’ \(Fig. 1\), as having a ‘significant economic impact’ through its producing ‘quicker return on investment \[…\] achieved because of the much higher productivity and shorter development cycle provided by the invented component\-based methodology and development process’ \[b\]. This biometric identification system contributes to the Global Technology Services segment of IBM’s business, which in 2019 comprised the largest share of IBM's total revenue at nearly 36% \($27.4 billion\) \[c\-ii\]. The use of Getov’s component based MPJ framework provided ‘pre\-built template components’ from which a system can be built that ‘guarantee\[d\] real\-time biometric identification functionality over a very large, constantly growing database of enrolled identities \(fingerprints\)’ \[b\]. Furthermore, Getov’s ICBE \(outputs \[4\], \[5\] and \[6\]\) ‘has been instrumental in continuously monitoring and maintaining the system’ \[b\], which has been a significant aspect of IBM’s commercial offering to corporations and governments \[c\-i\]. 




 Fig. 1: Security Biometric Identification System \[c\-iii\] 


 Another company that has economically benefitted from Getov’s innovative component\-based MPJ methodology, as well as the underpinning ETSI standards, is  [ActiveEon](https://www.activeeon.com/about/company/) – a France\-based software company that provides innovative open\-source solutions for IT automation, acceleration and scalability, big data, distributed computing and application orchestration. During the GridCOMP project \(06/2006 – 02/2009\), Getov and colleagues had initially demonstrated the usefulness of the component based MPJ development methodology to industry by using it to wrap and Grid\-enable aerodynamic wing modelling software at ActiveEon, and to prove the integration of data staging for the input and output files into this sweeping / optimisation process for any given configuration. 

 As Prof Denis Caromel, CEO of ActiveEon, states, since then the company ‘has been directly exploiting the results of the project, including the GCM and MPJ framework \(output \[3\]\), particularly in its *ProActive workflows and scheduling open\-source* middleware which has been used for delivering solutions for a range of commercial customers’ \[e\-i\]. Caromel further specifies the economic impact of this adoption of Getov’s innovations: ‘over the years since August 2013, **ActiveEon has achieved revenue growth of 18M USD starting with less than 1M USD in 2013 and reaching revenue of 19M USD in 2020**. Our number of employees has been increasing significantly over the same period from 30 employees at the end of 2013 to 106 employees in 2020. Those successful results would not have been possible without Professor Getov’s direct contribution to the component based MPJ development methodology and ETSI standards adopted and used by ActiveEon throughout the 13 years of its existence. His work has reduced substantially the return of investment cycle of complex distributed applications’ \[e\-i\]. 

#  Impact 3. Social Impact 

 Beyond the significant economic impact Vladimir Getov has made with his contributions, Buhler explains that ‘\[t\]he technical advancements he \[Getov\] has invented and co\-invented are the basis for many Web\-scale applications we have at our fingertips today’, creating a ‘resulting impact on the society’ \[b\]. IBM specify three key social impacts of their cognitive technology in lengthy case studies featuring real\-world usage of the IBM Watson supercomputer that would not exist without Getov’s research \[d\-ii to d\-iv\]. The areas of interventions listed below provide typical examples: 

-  **Transforming social services** by providing ‘easier\-to\-access, more personalized services \[that\] can help individuals at risk better manage their own well\-being, getting the right support when they need it’ \[d\-ii\]. A specific use case is ‘Aspiranet, which currently serves 22,000 youth and families across California, \[and\] is using natural language inquiry of unstructured data to help youth transition from foster home care to living on their own’; their CEO confirms ‘cognitive technology helps free up caseworkers’ time, enabling them to focus on what matters most, human connection’ \[d\-ii\]. This is a significant impact given that in the ‘United States, social worker turnover is as high as 90 percent per year, with heavy workloads, including paperwork, as a major contributing factor’ \[d\-ii\]. 

-  **Providing environmental protections:** IBM gives the example of their work with the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau to reduce air pollution in China \(the cause of more than one million premature deaths per year\) via the 2014 Green Horizons initiative, which ‘addresses these challenges by using advanced machine learning to identify smaller sections of the city that are at risk. Along with trade\-off analyses, this enables more targeted mitigation actions, such as shutting down targeted industries, while minimizing socioeconomic disruptions’ \[d\-iii\]. 

-  **Enhancing public safety**: IBM gives the example of how they used Watson to anticipate and respond to the Oct 2015 Hurricane Patricia \(one of the strongest storms ever recorded\): ‘weather prediction models based on artificial intelligence \(AI\) provided advanced warning to an IBM production center in Guadalajara. The system had analyzed huge volumes of disparate information, including weather data, social feeds and news reports to get a comprehensive view of the storm's trajectory. \[…\] Early warning gave site officials the crucial time they needed to act’ and they ‘opted to evacuate the site as a precautionary measure’ \[d\-iv\]. 

 Another example of social impacts that have been created through the adoption of Getov’s innovations is found in the work of ActiveEon.  As mentioned earlier, ActiveEon has used Getov’s component based MPJ development methodology in their *ProActive Workflows & Scheduling* software which incorporates dynamic and autonomous workload allocation to an elastic pool of resources using multi\-language software components within the HPC cloud\-based workflows \[e\-i\] \[e\-ii, p.30\]. Among a range of case studies demonstrating usage of this software across sectors including mining, satellite technology, visa processing, and solvency solutions \[e\-iii\], is its use for microbiome analytics orchestration \[e\-iv, p.18\-20\]. The enabling of microbiome analytics orchestration at this scale is of **significant benefit to the biomedical field as microbiome innovation encompasses pharmaceutical applications** such as personalised medicine and nutrition, identification of the impact of drugs on the gut microbiome, and identification of bacterial biomarkers associated with dysbiosis \(microbial imbalance\) \[e\-iv, p.8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 *Diogenes* is free, open\-source software which enables people around the world to access in digital form the totality of classical Greek and Latin literature, along with integrated morphology and lexica for language learners.  *Diogenes* has transformed the ability of readers in many countries to encounter and engage with classical literature in the original languages.  The mechanism for this impact comes via: \(a\) Version 3 of *Diogenes,* which remained in use during the present impact period; \(b\) Version 4 of *Diogenes*, a major rewrite released in September 2019; \(c\) a completely new webapp for phones and tablets, *DiogenesWeb* released in 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 This is not a case study continued from REF2014 according to strict REF criteria, for it includes new types of impact and new beneficiaries; but Version 3 of Diogenes was submitted as an ICS to REF2014 and continued in use during the current period. 

 **a\) Research on Latin poetry and its Greek sources.**  All versions of the *Diogenes* software have been entirely written by Heslin. As documented in the REF2014 impact case study, the genesis of *Diogenes* arose in the course of his research while writing the *Transvestite Achilles* **\[R1\]**, when he realised that existing tools for searching the standard databases of Latin and Greek texts available at the time gave incomplete and erroneous results.  Since then, the Packard Humanities Institute has made its corpus of Latin texts available via its website, but its search interface is primitive and insufficient for answering complex questions.  The rewrite of *Diogenes* that led to the release of Version 4 happened in response to and in order to facilitate its continuing daily use by Heslin in the course of writing *Propertius, Greek Myth, and Virgil* **\[R2\]**.  The substantial improvements made to the user interface of Version 4, listed below, arose from that work. 

 **b\) Diogenes as Research.**  As noted in the REF2014 impact case study, *Diogenes* is simultaneously a research output itself \(it was submitted as such to RAE2001, **\[R3\]**\), and a mechanism for transmitting the impact of that research to its users.  Decoding and reverse\-engineering the metadata and formatting codes of the archaic databases, which remain in a largely undocumented binary format, was a massive research project, the result of which is embedded in the software and its documentation **\[R3\]**.  Another output of that research effort is **\[R4\]**.  The most important new feature in Version 4, which required very significant effort, is the ability to export all of that metadata and formatting information in the ubiquitous modern standard for textual representation, which is TEI\-compliant XML.  This will serve to future\-proof the Latin and Greek text databases, which were created long ago at very great labour and cost, by translating the information encoded there into a format that will be legible long into the future.  It opens entirely new horizons of possibility for these indispensable corpora.  In more immediate terms, it permitted the development of the *DiogenesWeb* app for handheld devices, which takes that XML data and feeds it to a browser on a phone or tablet for conversion into HTML for display.  Creating this XML output functionality required fresh investigation into the formatting codes of the archaic databases and how they relate to the formatting conventions of scholarly editions.  This is fundamentally a research question that requires experience and expert knowledge of all the conventions of printed works of classical scholarship as well as of best practices in digital markup.  The result of this effort is embodied in the code \(specifically the file xml\-export.pl\). 

 **c\) Dissemination of Research Insights.** As referenced in the REF2014 impact case study, Heslin disseminated the research insights of his work on *Diogenes* in a series of publications.  This has continued since 2014.  An article, “The Dream of a Universal Variorum: Digitizing the Tradition” **\[R5\]**, builds upon Heslin’s experience in developing *Diogenes* to envision a future successor that would weave together not only texts and lexica but also the historic commentary tradition.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Summary.** 

 There are several collections of Latin and Greek texts available on the Internet, and various tools to help read them, but none of them, apart from *Diogenes*, combines access to the full range of classical literature with sophisticated search functionality and tight integration of the best available morphological and lexicographical tools.  This puts the totality of ancient literature along with the tools to engage fully with those texts at the fingertips of people with an interest in classical languages, from secondary students to pensioners, all over the world, especially in developing nations where access to printed resources is more limited; thus they can become better readers of the classics.  The evidence for this international societal impact is both quantitative and qualitative.  The quantitative evidence comes from webserver logs and the qualitative evidence comes from a recent survey of *Diogenes* users and from unsolicited correspondence from teachers, students and members of the general public **\[E1\]**. 

 **Chronology.**  Version 3 of *Diogenes*, which was submitted to REF2014 as an impact case study, had a browser\-like front\-end based upon a software component that was deprecated by the Mozilla project in 2015.  Despite its destined obsolescence, Version 3 continued to be downloaded and remained in active use until late 2019.  The present impact case study is primarily based, however, upon two subsequent developments: Version 4 of *Diogenes* and a new project, *DiogenesWeb*.  Creating Version 4 of *Diogenes* entailed pulling the old Mozilla code out of Version 3 and replacing it with a new interface which is based upon Google Chrome; this should be supported for many years to come.  Version 4 also brought a redesigned user interface and added a major new capability: exporting texts in a modern XML format.  This permitted the creation of *DiogenesWeb*, a webapp that was designed to provide the two features most commonly requested by users of *Diogenes* over the years: an app that would work on phones and tablets, and the ability to use it with other corpora of texts. 

 <ins> **N</ins><ins>ew</ins> <ins>benefits of</ins> <ins>Version 4.**</ins> 

 Version 4 includes a redesigned, modern user interface, which reflects feedback from users of Version 3; the new interface is much cleaner, more intuitive and provides better hints, which help the user to frame requests for information about usage and collocations more accurately.  It comes with many new capabilities beyond XML output, most of which were added at user request.  A major new feature is close integration with the *Thesaurus Linguae Latinae,* the most authoritative lexicon of the Latin language; clicking on a Latin word in *Diogenes* then brings up the correct page of the correct volume of the *TLL*.  Other significant new features include: quick searching through a single author; Greek text searches are now chronologically ordered; and it has corrected versions of the LSJ Greek lexicon and the Lewis and Short Latin lexicon.

 *Diogenes* users have long requested an app that will work on phones and tablets; the new XML export feature has finally made this possible.  Now *Diogenes* users can upload either their favourite texts or the entire PHI/TLG corpora to their private cloud storage in XML format and read them on their handheld devices with the same links to morphological analysis and lexica as those provided by the desktop application.  Another frequent request has been to extend the *Diogenes* interface to additional texts, and in response to that demand *DiogenesWeb* has added support for three open\-access corpora: Perseus, The First Thousand Years of Greek, and DigiLibLT \(late antique Latin\). 

####  Quantitative Evidence of Impact 

 **Version 3.** Version 3.1.6 has been downloaded 24,325 times since 2014.  Version 3.2, which was released in October 2014, was downloaded 18,405 times from the Durham website between January 2018 and April 2019 **\[E3\]**.  The top countries in terms of downloads of 3.2 were: **China**, **USA**, **Italy**, **Greece** and **Germany**, showing the international reach of the impact.  The nature of the impact of Version 3 on its beneficiaries is documented in the REF2014 ICS, and that impact continued into the current period until it was superseded by Version 4. 

 **Version 4.** The new *Diogenes* website has been expressly designed to capture information regarding whether the identity of its users qualify its impact for REF.  The website asks people before downloading Version 4 of the desktop application or using *DiogenesWeb* to self\-identify as academics or research postgraduates on the one hand, or as students or members of the general public on the other.  Through the end of 2020, 9,616 people had downloaded Version 4 of *Diogenes,* of which 4,401, or 46% were non\-academics.  Among those users, the top countries represented are \(as inferred from IP geolocation\): **Germany, USA, UK,** **Brazil** and **Japan** **\[E4\]**. 

 **DiogenesWeb.**  In the first year that *DiogenesWeb* has been operating, between 23 December 2019 and 31 December 2020, users have downloaded 22,745 Latin and Greek texts, of which 13,178 or 58% were read by users who did not identify as academics or postgraduates.  In that same period, users looked up 305,811 words, of which 205,447 or 67% of the queries were by non\-researchers.  The geographical spread of usage is similar to that for Version 4, but slightly different: **USA**, **Germany** and the **UK**, **Brazil** and **Ireland** **\[E5\]**.  The new, impact\-specific question asked by the new website, a feature not available for REF2014, provides firm quantitative evidence that, in addition to researchers in Classics, a very large number students and non\-academic users around the world also use *Diogenes*.  Note that for reasons of privacy users are not otherwise tracked, which limits the nature of the quantitative data that can be collected. 

####  Qualitative Evidence of Impact 

 Written feedback shows that beneficiaries value the following features of *Diogenes*: flexibility and power in searching; unified, portable access to large textual corpora and large lexica; convenience; speed; a well\-designed user interface; and that it is free. 

 *Diogenes* is used by secondary and undergraduate students the world over, particularly in developing nations.  **Mexico**: “I would describe *Diogenes*’ role in my academic life as substantial.  It has had a very positive impact in my life.”  **Mexico**: “Before I used to consult the university's library for some works, but they do not have all authors we need … And now I live far away from the university … I hope it continues to exist, cause this is a big help to students from countries like Mexico, where we have less access to the classics.”  **Turkey**: “I'm … an undergraduate classical philology student at Istanbul University … when I updated *Diogenes* \[to Version 4\], I simply gasped.  It is very obvious that you … worked very hard for this …  Layout is very glamorous …, search options are responding much faster and efficient…, the beautiful LSJ not hanging up at the top but *going along with the text* … I sincerely thank you for this beautiful tool and making it available for all.” **Brazil:** “Nunc possum multo celerius et commodius non modo legere textus Latinos atque Graecos, sed etiam eos vertere in Lusitanicum sermonem” \(Now I can more quickly and accurately not only read Latin and Greek texts, but also translate them into Portuguese\) **\[E1\]**. 

 **British** and **European** students agree. “I wanted to thank you for your amazing software, *Diogenes*. It helped me throughout secondary school in Spain and I use it daily for my University course. I also wanted to say that the new 4.0 version is great…\!”; “Much faster, easier to manoeuvre and more accessible anywhere \(don't have to carry a big book around\)”; “It has made my work smoother”; “Much quicker, easier, more efficient”.  For some students *Diogenes* is their primary means to access classical texts and lexica while in Covid\-19 lockdown: “because the access to ancient texts in *Diogenes* is so easy, my students read through them more eagerly \(especially now, when using the library is impossible\)” **\[E1\]**. *Diogenes* is used not only by students, but also used by professionals in the cultural sector: “Although not a classicist by trade \(I’m a translator\), I use this tool every single day. It has made my life richer and fuller, giving me unprecedented access to so many ancient works, not to mention the ease of consulting LSJ or Lewis and Short with a single click.  It truly is in a league of its own”.  Another writes: “The usefulness of *Diogenes* when translating became especially evident with the integration of *OLD* and *TLL* … I'm currently translating Cicero's *De natura deorum* into Estonian **\[E1\]**. 

 A **Chinese** correspondent highlights that, in contrast to most online tools, the desktop application is entirely self\-contained and does not require an Internet connection for any of its functionality: “I am writing to express my gratitude for your writing the *Diogenes* desktop application, which helped me a great deal in my mostly solitary study …. and the search environment you provide is a godsend for an independent scholar who cannot always afford *TLG* online access …. I can speak from experience from my visits to my native China, where there are many, many students and scholars interested in western Classical languages … yet the government tries to make access to the outside Internet as slow and high\-latency as they could … This means that projects like *Diogenes* Desktop application … \[are\] extremely useful for scholars, a kind of Samizdat for Classics for people behind the Great Firewall.” **\[E1\]**. 

 A **German** teacher of Classics also highlights the self\-contained nature of the desktop application, but for different reasons, as it means that he can take *Diogenes* anywhere, even on class trips to southern Italy: “For anyone dealing with ancient Greek or Latin texts *Diogenes* is of great use, but especially for students and those teaching students.  You can't do with a textbook or a mere digitized ‘online text’, what one can do \(or demonstrate\) with *Diogenes*: \(1\) preparing texts by analysing grammar … \(2\) studying semantic fields … not a long time ago this would have taken months and even years of reading, what now can be accomplished in minutes; \(3\) studying historical linguistics by observing how Greek or Latin word meanings and grammar changed over time … \(4\) deconstructing literary and intertextual codes in Greek and Roman poetry …, military and sexual vocabulary, etc. …; \(5\) it's ‘portable’ and it's ‘all there’: all the corpora … on a single computational device locally installed \- now it's possible even with handhelds/mobiles\! No rocket science needed. My students use it \(installed on an old tiny laptop\) all the time during our trips to the south of Italy while deciphering \(mural\) inscriptions in Pompeii and Herculaneum….” **\[E1\]**. 

 Teachers who have used *Diogenes* for many years were relieved when Version 4 came out, ensuring its continued viability.  A retired teacher from **Australia** writes: “I taught Latin and ancient Greek for many years and during that time made pretty heavy use of *Diogenes* … I was worried that it might be on the point of becoming obsolete.  So I was relieved to see that a new version is out.  I think it’s very important that *Diogenes* be properly supported.  For a lot of us involved in Classical Studies *TLG* and PHI transformed the way we interact with ancient texts—they made it much, much easier to follow leads and lines of interest out into other texts. *Diogenes* has been simply the best available tool in this endeavour.” **\[E1\]**. 

 A teacher from the **USA** notes the benefits of *DiogenesWeb* for students who may not go to the trouble of installing the desktop application: “None of my students, so far as I know, has their own personal … *TLG* or PHI corpus on their computers, so the development of the *DiogenesWeb* app has been a very good thing … I use *Diogenes* … to search various words and phrases across corpora so as to introduce comparative instances in the classroom … both to demonstrate the above kinds of inquiries and to answer ‘live’ questions in the classroom as they occur … I noticed that students in my Greek Prose Composition class … who self\-reported their own use of *Diogenes* tended to do much better on the assignments.” **\[E1\]**. 

 This latter observation that students who are encouraged to use *Diogenes* become better readers of Latin and Greek through being challenged to engage with the full spectrum of linguistic usage is echoed by other teachers.  **Netherlands:** “I teach full\-time in University \(undergraduate\) and in school \(gymnasium\), and occasionally in teacher training … I consistently recommend using *Diogenes* in this way to prospective teachers and TAs.  Based on targeted assignment results, I am quite happy to vouch that using *Diogenes* makes students, at any level of study, better classicists: more independent, versatile, self\-reliant, resourceful and critical.”  **USA:** “I use *Diogenes* in class all the time … Sometimes I project this on a screen for all to see; other times I have some individual student do the searching/looking up and then report back … All of this really helps sharpen our collective understanding of a text: we don't have to guess, we can directly consult all the evidence … \[It’s\] an amazing way to check our intuitions and sharpen our understanding of Greek/Latin.  My students often rely on *Diogenes* in writing their final papers, and I'd say that it allows them to reach a standard of knowledge that would otherwise take them far longer.  *Diogenes* helps students achieve the results that would take a professional scholar with an enormous memory a lifetime of reading \-\- and helps them achieve those results in a manageable amount of time.  This is remarkable.” **\[E1\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Non\-24\-hour Sleep\-Wake Rhythm Disorder \(N24HSWRD\) is a circadian rhythm disorder experienced by most totally blind people and which negatively affects their quality of life. Classic sedative\-hypnotics or stimulants are ineffective.  Research by the Chronobiology Section into the use of timed daily melatonin to entrain desynchronised circadian rhythms and reset sleep/wake cycles in the blind directly underpinned the development, clinical trailing and registration of melatonin agonist tasimelteon \(HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup>\) the first FDA/EMA approved drug for the management of circadian rhythm sleep/wake disorders in totally blind adults. Impact as patient benefit, commercial growth and continued innovation have resulted from the introduction of this treatment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Section of Chronobiology at the University of Surrey have pioneered research on daily low\-dose administration of melatonin to entrain desynchronised circadian rhythms in people with total blindness. Their findings directly underpinned the introduction of the first FDA/EMA approved drug \(HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup>\) for the management of Non\-24 Hour Sleep\-Wake Rhythm Disorder \(N24HSWRD\) in totally blind adults. 

  

 It is estimated that up to 70% of totally blind people have N24HSWRD, caused because their eyes are unable to send information to the brain about the daily light\-dark cycle. The endogenous circadian clock, located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei generates circadian rhythms that are close to, but not exactly 24 hours \(\~24.5 hours\). In the absence of light needed to reset our clocks, the body reverts to its own internal time leading to an average desynchronisation of \~30 minutes per day causing patients to experience episodes of good or bad sleep as their internal clock runs in and out of synch with the 24\-hour day. N24HSWRD is therefore characterised by poor night\-time sleep and excessive daytime naps, in addition to dysfunction of bodily systems under circadian control.  Furthermore, patients find it very challenging to engage in occupational, social and family activities. Although the underlying disorder is incurable, our research **\[R1, R2, R3\]** identified that daily melatonin treatment can reset the circadian clock and provide an effective treatment for N24HSWRD patients. 

  

 Early melatonin studies, while stabilising the sleep/wake cycle had failed to demonstrate entrainment. Professor Skene and her team \(Arendt, Lockley, Wright\) were the first to show that daily administration of melatonin \(5 mg\) can entrain ‘free\-running’ circadian rhythms in totally blind adults experiencing N24HSWRD **\[R1\]**. This was achieved because melatonin treatment was individualised to each patient’s circadian cycle length and given at the part of the cycle when it could have an immediate resetting effect \(21:00 hours daily for 35\-71 days\). Since the melatonin treatment is providing a daily time cue to replace the lost light signal, chronic administration of melatonin is necessary to maintain entrainment. Professor Skene’s team further demonstrated that low\-dose melatonin \(0.5 mg/daily\) could also reset the clock, again when timed appropriately to each person’s circadian clock **\[R2\]**. These studies demonstrated convincingly that melatonin was able to correct the underlying circadian rhythm abnormality thus improving night\-time sleep and reducing daytime napping and was the first example of using chronobiotic \(circadian\-timed\) treatment for a circadian rhythm sleep disorder **\[R3\]**. 

  

 Our landmark research findings informed the design of two clinical trials of tasimelteon \(HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup>\) led by the Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School \(PI, Lockley, Harvard\) which replicated the methodology \(fixed clock time for treatment, at least 1 circadian cycle\) and outcomes \(rhythmic sleep, nap time\) developed by the team at the University of Surrey to assess circadian entrainment. The University of Surrey formally shared data sets on urinary 6\-sulphatoxymelatonin with Vanda Pharmaceuticals to optimise the study design \(i.e., power calculation\) and raw sleep/nap and cycle length data **\[R2\]** used to validate novel markers to assess the effectiveness of tasimelteon \(HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup>\) in treating N24HSWRD.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **International approval of tasimelteon \(HETLIOZ®\) for the treatment of Non\-24\-Hour Sleep\-Wake Rhythm Disorder \(N24HSWRD\) in people with total blindness** 

 On 31 January 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) approved tasimelteon \(HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup>\) as the **first treatment for N24HSWRD in people with total blindness** under the orphan drug pathway. The FDA committee agreed that the drug had *“*proven to be effective and safe for patients with non\-24 *”* **\[S1\]**. On 7 July 2015, the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) also approved HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> for the treatment of N24HSWRD in totally blind adults in 28 European Union countries, as well as Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway **\[S2\]**. HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> was launched commercially in the U.S in April 2014 and Germany in August 2016 **\[S3\]**. These approvals mark a paradigm shift with the **introduction of a new drug class**: HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> is the first and only drug to date that is approved based on its ability to reset the circadian pacemaker to treat a circadian rhythm disorder. 

  

 Research conducted by Professor Skene and her team into the effectiveness of melatonin to entrain free\-running circadian rhythms in people with total blindness **directly informed the clinical trials design and subsequent licensing application** of tasimelteon \(HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup>\) **\[S4\]**. The protocol design of these clinical trials replicated the methodology and outcomes developed at the University of Surrey to assess circadian entrainment. Data sets shared with Vanda Pharmaceuticals by the University of Surrey were used to optimise the clinical study design \(e.g., informing the power calculation\) of these clinical trials and raw sleep/nap and cycle length data from Professor Skene’s 0.5 mg melatonin study **\[R2\]** were used to validate novel markers to assess the effectiveness of tasimelteon \(HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup>\) in treating N24HSWRD **\[S4, S5\]**. Professor Skene also provided expert evidence in support of Vanda Pharmaceutical’s application to the EMA in May 2015 **\[S6\]**. 

  

 The introduction of this FDA/EMA approved treatment for N24HSWRD has **benefitted patients and raised awareness of this debilitating disorder**. At the time of designation \(2015\), the EMA estimated the number of patients affected by N24HSWRD as between 6,000\-112,000 people \(1.5 and 2.2 in 10,000\) in Europe. Prior to the designation of HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup>, no satisfactory therapies were authorised in the EU for the treatment of N24HSWRD **\[S2\]**. Professor Skene has **increased awareness and public understanding** of this and other rare sleep disorders through a series of public talks \(i.e., Royal Institute, Hay Festival, Design Museum\), radio and newspaper interviews \(i.e., Radio 4 *,* The Observer, The Guardian\) and television documentaries \(i.e., Secrets of the Body Clock with Terry Wogan, BBC One; Horizon, BBC2\) **\[S7\]**. 

  

###  Commercial growth and continued innovation 

 Quarter end financial results for the first full quarter \(third\) following the launch of HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> in the US in April 2014 show sales grew to $5.2 million with over 600 new patient prescriptions written during that quarter. Vanda President and CEO Mihael Polymeropoulos said “Our innovative approach to the commercialisation of HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> for \[N24HSWRD\] has yielded impressive third quarter revenue. We are developing a robust commercial engine that has just begun to access the \[N24HSWRD\] market in the US by creating awareness leading to diagnosis and treatment.” **Sales of HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> have continued to grow year on year** with net product sales of $38.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 19% from the fourth quarter of 2018 \($32.4m\). Full\-year net product sales for 2019 were $143 million, an increase of 23% from 2018 \($115.8m\) **\[S3\]**. 

  

 Professor Skene and her team continued to **work in partnership with Vanda Pharmaceuticals to support their innovation into new markets**. Professor Skene’s expertise in the use of melatonin to entrain ‘free\-running’ circadian rhythms gained through her research **\[R1, R2, R3\]** was called upon by Vanda Pharmaceuticals to inform the protocols for clinical trials of HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> for a broader range of indications resulting from circadian desynchronisation including jetlag, metabolic disorders, and other sleep\-wake disorders. Commercial research undertaken at the Surrey Clinical Research Centre \(University of Surrey\) resulted in an FDA application for HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> in the treatment of jetlag in April 2018. A further New Drug Application \(sNDA\) for HETLIOZ<sup>®</sup> in the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with Smith\-Magenis Syndrome \(SMS\), another rare genetic disorder has also been filed. Phase III testing is currently underway for paediatric N24HSWRD and delayed sleep phase disorder \(DSPD\). This innovation has risen directly from the original research conducted by the Section of Chronobiology.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Globally, more than 200 million people with incontinence depend on technology to manage their condition. University of Southampton \(UoS\) research has led to novel sustainable continence products, online support tools and development of standards that have improved the lives of people with incontinence worldwide by: 

 **Increasing user confidence in product choice and access to products:** 1\) The *Continence Product Advisor* website, co\-created by UoS, has had more than one million visits worldwide and is a core component of a professional development massive open online course \(MOOC\) with users in 119 countries. 2\) New International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\) and World Health Organisation \(WHO\) standards shaped by UoS research have given lower income countries sustainable access to products that were previously unavailable or too expensive. 

 **Providing sustainable product choices for intermittent catheter users:** Novel intermittent catheter cleaning methods have expanded options beyond single\-use plastic catheters for users worldwide by enabling CE marking of 1\) the first biodegradable, reusable intermittent catheter for women and 2\) a biodegradable, biocidal wipe effective at decontaminating intermittent catheters. 

 **Improving options for convenient, safe use of male incontinence devices:** UoS researchers have designed a reusable penile compression device and produced evidence\-based guidance to help thousands of men worldwide manage post\-prostatectomy incontinence.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Estimates of urinary incontinence in the UK alone indicate that as many as six million people are affected. People rely on continence products and devices to manage a condition that many find difficult to talk about, and it can be challenging to identify and access products that meet their physical and emotional needs. In recent years, single\-use products, especially absorbent pads and urinary catheters, have become ‘the norm’ despite their significant environmental impact. Working with product users and carers, the Bladder and Bowel Management Group at UoS has used clinical trials, experimental methods, qualitative research and evidence syntheses to co\-design and develop sustainable technologies to improve the quality of life of people living with incontinence. 

 **Clinical trials and decision\-aid methodology: Supporting product choice, decision\-making and product development.** Since 2006, Fader has led a series of trials to assess the performance of different continence product designs. A Medical Device Agency funded trial of absorbent products for men with light incontinence \[ **3.1**\] showed substantial differences in performance between disposable and reusable products and between different designs, winning the International Continence Society best abstract award \(Montreal, 2005\). Building on this work, in 2008 Fader led a Health Technology Assessment \(HTA\) programme of three clinical trials \[ **3.2**\] comparing the effectiveness of different absorbent continence product designs for men and women at home and in nursing homes. Her research showed, for the first time, important gender preferences and highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of different designs of both washables and disposables for different needs. 

 Men’s needs were investigated further in a Prostate Cancer Charity\-funded cross\-over trial comparing the effectiveness of four product designs for men with post\-prostatectomy incontinence \[ **3.3**\]. This was the first published study to compare different continence devices for men and showed the potential value \(highly effective for leakage\) and limitations \(pain and discomfort\) of the penile compression device \(clamp\), demonstrating the need for an improved design and, unlike for many existing clamps, clear user safety guidance. The research revealed that some device designs, when compared with pads, significantly improved men’s quality of life and reduced the number of disposable pads used. Most men found a ‘mix’ of products to be more effective although they lacked information on which to base their product selection decision\-making. In parallel, and to make this and other continence product research more accessible for clinicians and product users, Fader developed the concept of an evidence\-based interactive website. This was based on the framework developed for the evidence synthesis chapter *Management with Continence Products* published by the International Consultation on Incontinence \[ **3.4**\] and co\-authored by Fader. 

 To enable users to select products most suited to their needs utilising the results of our research and to build on the findings of the male devices study \[ **3.3**\], we were awarded a programme grant \(GBP830,000\) from Movember/Prostate Cancer UK. This included funding for the first evidence –based *Continence Product Decision Aid* which Fader and Dr Cathy Murphy developed using patient decision\-aid methodology. We demonstrated that use of the tool improved user confidence in decision\-making and reduced decision conflict \[ **3.5**\] and it was incorporated into the *Continence Product Advisor.* In response to men’s need for improved information and better products \[ **3.3**\] a new prostate cancer section funded by this programme was built into the *Continence Product Advisor.* This programme also funded the development of a new clamp design as identified by our male devices study \[ **3.3**\]. 

 **Experimental laboratory work: Developing novel reprocessing methods for intermittent catheterisation.** In 2007, Fader co\-authored a Cochrane review showing insufficient evidence for any catheter design or catheterisation technique affecting the rate of urinary tract infection \[ **3.6**\]. This called into question the industry\-driven, large\-scale shift away from catheter reuse to single\-use plastic catheters, which reduced user choice and had substantial cost implications. According to the Prescription Cost Analysis, NHS spend increased from GBP13m in 2008 to GBP104m in 2018. In England alone around 75,000 plastic intermittent catheters end up in landfill every year. The Cochrane findings underpinned the award to Fader of a GBP2.4m NIHR programme grant that included a randomised controlled trial comparing single\-use catheters with ‘mixed’ use \(single\-use and multi\-use\) catheters. In preparation for the trial, Dr Sandra Wilks and Dr Jacqui Prieto developed, with patients, the first evidence\-based, reliable and practical reprocessing method based on the Milton™ cold water sterilising method. When tested with catheter users, the UoS *Multicath Milton* method removed a range of common uro\-pathogens from intermittent catheters when cleaned between uses and was acceptable to users. It allows the reuse of uncoated catheters repeatedly for up to 28 days \[ **3.7**\] and led directly to the CE marking and marketing of the world’s first reusable and biodegradable intermittent catheter \(Emteva<sup>TM</sup>\) by UK company Hunter Urology. Interviews undertaken by Prieto with 40 catheter users highlighted the benefits of choice of catheter type to users who want the convenience of a disposable catheter but also the security of a reusable one.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 University of Southampton research designed to improve quality of life for people with incontinence has benefitted: a\) patients, by increasing user confidence in and access to a wider and more sustainable range of continence products and devices, b\) clinicians, supporting their practice through evidence\-based online guidance, professional development training and the availability of new devices on prescription, and c\) policymakers, through the development of new international standards and WHO product specifications that strengthen regulation of clinical devices and widen access to quality, cost\-effective products in low\-income countries. 

 **Increased confidence in product choice and wider access to products for users, their informal carers and clinicians** 

 We pitched the concept of the *Continence Product Advisor* website to the International Continence Society, the foremost, international, multi\-disciplinary organisation for incontinence education and research \(3000\+ members worldwide\), who invested in the technical expertise to build and launch the website in November 2013. This website is the first evidence\-based, comprehensive and independent \(i.e. not industry\-driven\), multimedia resource for patients and clinicians, utilising our research \[ **3.1\-3.3,3.5**\] to support continence product selection and use. It is the only evidence\-based source of continence product advice listed on the NHS website for patients, with more than 1 million visits from men and women from more than 190 countries worldwide over the impact period. It averages more than 10,000 visitors per month. More than 890 product queries and 240 user tips have been submitted by users, informal carers and clinicians, each answered by an expert nurse \[ **5.1**\]. The website is maintained by the International Continence Society and it is a valued resource for its international membership and their patients. Its former Secretary General states: “ *The value of the website is inestimable … I find the website incredibly helpful to guide both patients and caregivers in the selection of appropriate products*.” \[ **5.2**\] Online surveys show that most users found the website ‘very helpful’ \(74%\), gaining confidence in product selection and use \(66%\) \[ **5.3**\]. Representative feedback included: “ *It is … very informative, helped me realise there are many more options to manage incontinence than I thought”* and for men preparing for surgery, *“Forewarned is forearmed … takes away some of the fear … helps you to deal with your situation more easily and confidently”.* 

 The *Continence Product Advisor* is the core component of a new education programme \(MOOC\) *Understanding Continence Promotion* \[ **5.4**\], launched in February 2019 by the UK Association for Continence Advice \(ACA\), a membership organisation for all health and care professionals, including NHS Trust continence service leads, with an interest in bladder and bowel health. The course, which offers training on how to support self\-management of continence conditions, is free to ACA members and can count as a professional development credit – although informal carers and people living with incontinence have also completed it. It has been run six times over the REF impact period, training 3622 people from 119 countries; 100% of responders to a post\-course survey reported gaining knowledge or skills and online reviews posted on the FutureLearn site gave an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.0. \[ **5.4**\] 

 Representative feedback included: “ *I think it would great if all nurses could have this introduction to what continence means, the effects it has on individuals … made me reflect on my current practice*” \(Nurse of 12 years\). “ *Made me feel like taking up nursing again*” \(Informal carer\). “ *It has enlightened me on how to treat and take care of my bowel and if there’s incontinence occurrence how to control and treat it*” \(Person living with incontinence\). \[ **5.4**\] Professor Jo Booth, MOOC Lead stated: “ *Without access to this unique resource \(Continence Product Advisor\) we would have had great difficulty in delivering the comprehensive, independent information our students need.*” \[ **5.5**\] 

 **New international standards to improve product quality, strengthen device regulation and increase access to cost\-effective, reliable continence products in low\-income countries** 

 As a result of her role in *Management with Continence Products* \[ **3.4**\] and the clinical trials \[ **3.1\-3.3**\], in 2016 Fader was invited by the International Continence Society to lead an international group of experts to develop standardised terminology for absorbent products \[ **5.6**\]. Absorbent incontinence products come in a wide range of different designs, but the variety of synonyms used to describe them are confusing for product users, clinicians, manufacturers and purchasing agencies. A new standard was needed to better reflect current product design and aid decision\-making. The outcome of the work was a new recommended terminology for all designs of single use absorbent products \[ **5.7**\]. Fader’s research influenced the International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\) when the ICS terms were adopted by ISO. Jesper Nordlinder, ISO Aids for Ostomy and Continence Committee Lead stated: “ *ISO standards are highly influential documents which are used worldwide by industry \(manufacturers of the products specified\) and key institutions involved in the procurement of products including the UK Supply Chain … Professor Fader’s research \[has\] provided her with unique expertise on the use of a wide range of products, both from a clinical and academic standpoint. Therefore, as a consequence of the close working between the two committees, her expertise influenced the ISO terminology*.” \[ **5.8**\]. 

 Fader was subsequently invited by the WHO in 2016 to develop assistive product specifications \(APS\) for disposable and washable absorbent continence products \[ **5.9**\] which utilised the new standards. The WHO Global Cooperation on Assistive Technology \(GATE\) had launched the Priority Assistive Products List, selected on the basis of widespread need and impact on people’s lives. APSs underpin the priority assistive product lists and provide a set of standards that regulate the procurement of absorbent continence products in low\-income countries. They are used by government procurement officers to guide tendering processes and inform the UNICEF catalogue. In Tajikistan for example, absorbent pads have been highlighted as the fifth most needed assistive product group. The APS developed by Fader et al was adopted onto Tajikistan’s new assistive products list in 2019 \[ **5.10**\]; this enabled procurement agencies in Tajikistan, for the first time, to purchase clinically effective, sustainable and cost\-effective continence products. Describing the UoS research contribution as ‘ *essential*’, WHO’s GATE lead said: “ *The inclusion of the specifications for absorbent continence products, developed by Professor Fader, is an important advancement for the millions of people managing incontinence with limited access to essential products*.” \[ **5.9**\] This has recently led to Fader and Murphy being commissioned by WHO to research the provision and use of washable absorbents in low income countries \(GBP60,000\). 

 **Provision of sustainable, reusable and effective options for intermittent catheter users** 

 Fader has highlighted the shortcomings of catheter design and the need for innovation in design and methods for use in various media interviews, including live appearances on BBC Breakfast and Radio 4 *Today* in 2015. The UoS group subsequently worked with a company developing a biodegradable, reusable intermittent catheter in order to reduce the use of single use plastics. The UoS *MultiCath Milton* cleaning method \[ **3.7**\] was essential in enabling the first reusable and biodegradable intermittent catheter, Emteva<sup>TM</sup> \(Hunter Urology\), to become CE marked for sale in the EU and available for patients via the UK drug tariff. Prior to Emteva, the estimated 20,000\+ female intermittent catheter users in the UK alone were confined to single use catheters. The availability of a reusable intermittent catheter to use alongside single use ones has been reported by catheter users to provide optimal choice for their physical and lifestyle needs. The CEO of Hunter Urology stated: “ *The work done by Professor Fader’s team at the University of Southampton has been essential in enabling the reusable Emteva catheter to become available to catheter users.*” \[ **5.11**\]. Around 36,000 Emteva catheters have been prescribed in England alone since 2016 benefitting approximately 9,000 women \[ **5.12**\]; they are also sold internationally, including in Denmark and Australia \[ **5.11**\]. The estimated annual cost per user for single\-use intermittent catheters is GBP2,190 \(based on typical usage of 4 catheters per day at a mean intermittent catheter cost of GBP1.50\). If one Emteva is substituted for all daily catheterisations, this equates to an annual saving for all female intermittent catheter users in the UK of more than GBP32,000,000 and a 100% reduction in plastic catheters being thrown away. 

 Based on the findings in **3.7**, Wilks was awarded a Small Business Research Initiative grant \(GBP530,000; NIHR\) to develop and test a biodegradable, biocidal, impregnated wipe to offer a quick, discreet alternative or complementary cleaning method to Milton. This was designed to further increase the uptake of reusable intermittent catheters. A partnership with JVS Products Ltd developed a biocidal wipe that was shown to be effective at cleaning reusable catheters ‘on the go’. Having achieved its Class I CE mark in 2020, JVS temporarily pivoted the product towards the surface cleaning market in response to the Covid\-19 pandemic, achieving more than 150,000 in sales up to December 31, 2020 \[ **5.13**\]. 

 **Improved options for safe penile compression device use and development of the ‘Southampton clamp’** 

 Having identified through their research \[ **3.3**\] a need among men for an effective, reusable clamp to enable physical activity and reduce reliance on disposable, plastic\-backed pads, the UoS group, together with clamp users, co\-designed a new clamp that is more effective, more comfortable/less painful and easier to use than existing designs. The ‘Southampton clamp’ \[ **5.14**\] provides a reusable \(and therefore sustainable\), discreet and secure way of preventing leakage after prostatectomy. A preliminary user trial showed that men felt the design is discrete and looks good, and is easy to put on and take off, compared with the best of the currently available clamps. A new industry partner will support prototype development, licensing \(CE marking\) and commercialisation of the clamp \(and other newly developed products\) via internet sales and the Drug Tariff \[ **5.15**\]. Currently manufacturers’ guidance provided with several clamp brands is not based on evidence, which places users at risk of pressure\-related skin damage. Working with clamp users, UoS research also enabled the development and publication of evidence\-based generic clamp guidance on the *Continence Product Advisor*.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Sheffield Hallam University research has improved teacher professional development \(PD\) in the UK and abroad by **shaping policy, encouraging investment and developing practice**. Research on teacher PD has informed UK government Department for Education **policy** in relation to early career teacher mentoring, professional qualifications in PD leadership and significant **investment** in national PD programmes. It has led to changes in the policies, practices and investment in PD activity of and by the Wellcome Trust, the Institute of Physics, and the Teacher Development Trust \- all influential **national educational organisations**. As outcomes of extensive knowledge exchange activity, underpinned by the research, over 300 leaders of teacher PD in England and Ghana have been directly **upskilled**. This has resulted in **practice improvements**, with more than 10,000 teachers receiving enhanced professional development directly linked to Sheffield Hallam PD projects, as well as many more benefitting from the wider investment in teacher PD informed by the research findings.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Boylan, Coldwell, Hobson, Maxwell and Perry have developed a substantial programme of research, through wide\-ranging evaluation and theoretical study of PD programmes, initiatives and PD leadership. Since 2007, the programme has encompassed over 50 research projects. External funding has exceeded £4.5 million, with studies funded by: government \(e.g. Department for Education \(DfE\) and its agencies such as the Teacher Development Agency\), government\-funded bodies \(e.g. the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics\), third sector organisations \(e.g. Gatsby Foundation\) and the private sector \(Wipro Ltd \- a global technology company headquartered in India\). 

 The research programme has focused on two inter\-related areas:

 Coldwell, Maxwell and colleagues undertook a set of projects \[ **R1**\- **R3**\], including a major longitudinal study of early career teachers \[ **R1**\]. They found that PD methods, including mentoring, influence teacher retention and career development. Key findings were: 

 1\) Teachers’ career aspirations firm up in their early years. Consequently, retention issues arise where new teachers’ experience low\-quality induction \[ **R1**\]. 

 2\) Teacher wellbeing is dependent on a wider range of individual, relational and environmental factors beyond basic psychological needs. This finding was based on secondary analysis of data from R1, another large\-scale five\-year study, and research on mentoring and coaching \[ **R2**\]. 

 3\) Intentions to stay in the profession were higher for teachers who engage in high\-quality PD. This was particularly due to improved knowledge and sense of efficacy; while the varying impact of PD on career outcomes was influenced by a combination of personal, organisational and policy context factors \[ **R3**\]. 

####  Improving Capacity for Leadership of Professional Development 

 Boylan et al identified ways that the leadership of professional development is important to effective PD, including factors that facilitate and develop such leadership. Boylan's review of policy\-orientated evaluations identified the importance of PD leadership to the success of national government policy innovations \[ **R4**\]. Based on analysis of leadership in professional development programmes, and specifically those of the National Centre for the Teaching of Mathematics, the research identified that PD leadership involves being an advocate, mobiliser and champion for PD \- to broker and instigate greater access to PD for teachers \[ **R5**\]. Extending this, Perry and Boylan identified ways that effective PD leadership can be supported through a framework of skills, knowledge and capabilities. This informed research\-based programmes to support PD leaders \[ **R6**\]. Boylan et al reconceptualised analytical models of PD as tools to inform design, implementation and local evaluation of PD \- leading to guidance which supports PD leaders in the selection of analytical models for designing, delivering and evaluating PD \[ **R7**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The professional development of teachers is key to improving pupils’ educational outcomes, by enhancing teaching quality, teacher wellbeing and increasing teacher retention. Sheffield Hallam research improved professional development by shaping national education policy and developing practice. 

####  Shaping National Educational Policy 

 Through the engagement of Boylan, Coldwell, Maxwell and Perry in the policy arena, such as the DfE’s PD expert group \[ **E1**, **E2**\], and Twiselton’s \(Director of Sheffield Institute of Education\) membership of a number of major policy development groups, findings from teacher PD research have **influenced national educational policy**, including evidencing the links between PD and teacher retention \[ **R1**, **R3**\] and the importance of improving PD leadership \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. These findings were **adopted in DfE policy documents** \[ **E3**\], influencing the development of the DfE’s Early Career Framework \(ECF\) for **all new teachers in England**, and a new professional qualification \- the Leading Teacher Development Specialist National Professional Qualification \(NPQ\). The DfE’s Director of Teacher Workforce has confirmed that: **""**Sheffield Hallam University's research has **helped develop, in current policy, a very clear relationship between retention and early career support and development**. This is seen by the clear pathway now being implemented from ITE to ECF to specialist NPQs to senior and executive leadership*"" \[ **E1**\]. 

 The suite of research and evaluation carried out by Boylan and others has influenced DfE funding for PD initiatives. For example, the findings of the Mathematics Teacher Exchange \[ **R4**\] **""played a significant role in shaping the policy development**"" of the DfE’s mathematics teacher PD policy \[ **E4**\]. This included **£41million investment**, part of which funded the establishment of Primary Mastery specialist PD. This programme has trained 800 PD leaders, who are now **supporting teachers in approximately 40% of primary schools in England** \[ **E4**\]. 

####  Wider Influence on Professional Development Policy and Practice 

 In addition to DfE policy, the research has **shaped national third sector organisations’ policy and provision** through funded partnership activity, presentations to advisory and practitioner groups, and support for policy development. Findings from **R5** and **R6** have *“significantly contributed to the research evidence on teachers’ professional development in the UK*” and have informed the Wellcome Trust's policy engagement with government including *""dialogue with CPD Policy Leads at the Department for Education, roundtable events with a broad range of subject associations and sector organisations both within and beyond science, presentations at conferences and at an All\-Party Parliamentary Group, and discussion with the Minister for School Standards""* \[ **E5**\]. 

 The research has **influenced policy and PD provision** by the Institute of Physics \(IoP\), including an online tool, based on **R6**, designed to support PD leaders \(coaches\) who are responsible for the IoP’s PD programme. According to the Teacher Recruitment and Retention Manager, *“\[Perry\] and colleagues’ inputs into IOP’s activities have influenced our policies around teacher professional development and the practices we use to support IOP coaches and other professional development leaders who deliver this work”* \[ **E6**\]. Similarly, the research has influenced the Teacher Development Trust’s **policy and PD practice,** including a PD programme \- Leading Lesson Study \- delivered jointly by TDT and SHU, with 70 teachers participating. 

 The CEO of the Teacher Development Trust confirmed that as a result, "" *TDT’s policy has moved from a general aim to improve the quality of teacher professional development, to its current greater focus on the importance of the leadership of professional developmen*t"" \[ **E2**\]. 

####  Benefits for Professional Development Leaders, Schools and Teachers 

 During the assessment period, with Perry as Head of Knowledge Exchange, approximately £2,000,000 of external funding was secured to undertake more than 30 PD\-focused knowledge exchange projects, often collaboratively, underpinned by the research. Examples include: 

-  The 2018\-20 Wellcome CPD Challenge Champions programme, which was underpinned by R5\-7. This two\-year programme of support and training was delivered to 60 PD leaders from 40 primary, secondary and special schools. The Professional Development Programme Lead at Wellcome Trust acknowledged that "" *the support for CPD leaders was designed through application of Emily Perry and Mark Boylan’s research into professional development leadership*"" \[ **E5**\]. The programme led to **improvements in over 1500 teachers’ PD**, increasing the average annual amount of PD teachers engaged in from 39 to 52 hours in the first year, representing an additional 19,500 hours of PD. 62% of teachers reported improvements in their knowledge surrounding pedagogy, and 50% that learning from PD had demonstrably **improved their teaching practice** \[ **E7**\]. One PD leader emphasised how *""the theory behind the approaches to CPD was incredibly useful for identifying next steps and needs of staff""* \[ **E6**\]. 

-  The Wipro Teacher Fellows and Mentors’ programme, funded by Wipro Ltd, was designed through application of **R1**\- **R2** and **R5**\- **R7**. The programme provided PD for early career teachers of STEM subjects, including mentoring by other teachers and a development programme for these mentors. Between 2018\-20, 26 teacher mentors participated in PD, supporting 30 early career teachers, leading to **positive impacts on their mentoring and PD leadership practice** within the programme and in their schools. One Wipro Mentors’ programme participant reflected that, *“\[As a result of\] looking at the latest research materials and being presented with the latest research… I have as a consequence drastically **reformed our CPD programme for all of our NQTs**”* \[ **E8**\]. 

-  Support for teachers in Ghana to lead science teacher PD, in a programme funded by the Ghanaian Ministry of Education, was informed by findings from **R2** and **R5**\- **R7**. Through co\-development and delivery of PD, the new PD leaders **improved their skills, knowledge and capabilities in PD leadership**. Developing a team of local PD leaders, rather than relying on overseas expertise, represented a significant change in the local context with the programme **reaching all 180 senior high schools in the country and enabling 1500 teachers to benefit** from enhanced PD \[ **E9**\]. 

-  A regional PD programme for 50 PD leaders in the Science Learning Network, funded by STEM Learning Ltd, was developed from the findings of R6 to improve PD leaders’ capabilities, knowledge and skills for leading PD. Between 2013\-16, these PD leaders **developed and delivered PD for approximately 6000 teachers, with consistently positive impact measures,** such as over 90% positive impact on teachers’ knowledge, skills and practice and over 80% positive impact on pupil outcomes \[ **E10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Orla Lynskey’s research has directly influenced major legal and policy proposals seeking to secure effective data protection in digital markets, particularly those with dominant market players. Specifically, her research has had a significant impact on the European Data Protection Supervisor’s recommendations to ensure a coherent approach to digital rights in the context of big data processing. It has also informed and influenced policy debate and recommendations regarding the assessment of data\-driven mergers and abuses of market power in digital markets. In addition, engagement with the research by civil society organisations, notably the European Consumer Organisation and Privacy International, has helped to ensure they are better able to defend the interests of those they represent. By influencing substantive and institutional reforms designed to ensure coherence between data protection and competition law frameworks, her research has contributed to the process of establishing a more robust protection of fundamental rights. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The data protection framework is premised on the belief that individuals should have certain rights in relation to their personal data and its processing. Lynskey’s pioneering monograph, *The Foundations of EU Data Protection Law* **\[1\]**, argued that, given the scale and complexity of data processing operations in the online sphere: 

 \(1\) these rights, and control over personal data more generally, are called into question; 

 \(2\) individuals alone cannot ensure effective data protection; 

 \(3\) given the dominant role of powerful digital companies such as Facebook and Google, more cross\-cutting, holistic approaches to such protection are required. 

 The conclusion stemming from this research was that the market structure in which an individual is asked to exercise their data protection rights can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of these rights. For example, one could query whether consent is “freely given” when there is no competition in the market \(i.e. no alternatives\) and the service in question is of social and professional importance to individuals. By paying more attention to structure, one could observe two inter\-related dynamics. First, that there is a significant concentration of ownership of digital consumer\-facing platforms in the hands of few providers; and, second, that with respect to data protection, there is little competition or differentiation between digital platforms and service providers. As a result, although the data protection framework seeks to facilitate choice and control over data and, more generally, to promote a fair data processing environment, these aims are jeopardised by the failure to acknowledge data protection considerations in competitive assessments. 

 In subsequent research, Lynskey elaborated on what a more holistic approach to the attainment of effective data protection online would entail, arguing that competition law should be applied in a way that assists in the achievement of this aim. The approach advocated has three dimensions **\[2\] \[3\]**. 

 First, the “consumer welfare” standard used by competition authorities to guide enforcement, which currently focuses on ensuring lower prices, more choice, and better quality products, should be interpreted to include data protection considerations. Lynskey’s research argues that the level of data protection offered to individuals forms part of the overall “quality” of a product \(e.g. weak data protection safeguards would be an indicator of poor quality\). Her claim is that competition authorities should use data protection law as a normative benchmark against which to measure this aspect of quality and that this should be utilised in merger or “abuse of dominance” \(Article 102 TFEU\) assessments. 

 Second, in addition to the incorporation of such non\-price considerations in the consumer welfare lens in mergers, Lynskey’s analysis shows that data\-driven mergers and acquisitions \(such as Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp\) should be subject to a non\-competition assessment alongside the competitive assessment of the merger, drawing an analogy with the “media plurality” assessment undertaken in media mergers pursuant to the discretion granted to EU Member States by Article 21 of the EU Merger Regulation. 

 Third, her research recommends that regulators engage in institutional cooperation in order to ensure a coherent approach between different regulators working in data\-related fields, such as consumer protection, competition, and data protection law. 

 Lynskey’s was the first research to propose such an approach, and while it was vigorously contested at the time in the competition law and policy community, the first and third elements outlined above are now widely accepted, while a recent announcement from the Competition and Markets Authority suggests that the second will now also be implemented in the UK. 

 Finally, in more recent work **\[4\] \[5\] \[6\]** Lynskey examined whether control over personal data contributed to the power of digital companies \- “data power” \- and whether the role of data portability initiatives in data protection and competition law could act as a constraint on this power.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Lynskey’s research has had an impact on the European Union's data protection authority, UK policymakers, and civil society organisations by demonstrating the significance of the relationship between data protection and competition law and elucidating the attendant areas of concern. These stakeholders have benefitted through the subsequent shaping of robust legal and policy positions and proposals and, in the case of civil society organisations, by being better able to defend the interests of those they represent and to define best practice for and enhance the knowledge of their staff. 

 **Shaping the European Data Protection Supervisor’s recommendations, which acted as a catalyst for global legal and policy reform** 

 The European Data Protection Supervisor \(EDPS\) is the EU’s independent data protection authority. An important part of its remit involves developing a vision for the future development of data protection law and providing policy guidance to address new challenges in the field. As such, it is one of the most influential data protection authorities worldwide. 

 In March 2014, the EDPS published a preliminary opinion, *Privacy and competitiveness in the age of big data*. The aim of this initiative was to identify whether the lack of competition in important consumer\-facing digital markets \(e.g. social networking services and search engines\) was having a negative impact on data protection and to make relevant recommendations. A substantially developed and revised final Opinion was subsequently published in September 2016 *: The EDPS Opinion on coherent enforcement of fundamental rights in the age of big data* **\[A\]**. This final Opinion was both explicitly and implicitly shaped by Lynskey’s research. 

 The 2014 preliminary opinion contained only three brief paragraphs over 38 pages discussing “data protection as a factor in consumer welfare”. It noted that “ *it may be necessary to develop a concept of consumer harm, particularly through violation of rights to data protection, for competition enforcement in digital sectors of the economy*” but did not elaborate on what this “harm” might be or how it could be assessed. In developing this claim and setting out recommendations, the final Opinion cites **\[2\]** to support its recommendation that data protection standards can be used “ *to determine ‘theories of harm’ relevant to merger control cases and to cases of exploitative abuse*” of a dominant position **\[A\]**. The Opinion also cites this research **\[2\]** to support the claims that “ *there are circumstances in which data protection can provide a relevant normative benchmark for competition law*”, and that there is competition law “ *precedent for using another field of law*” to find a restriction of competition **\[A\]**. 

 Lynskey has also been instrumental in shaping the policy of the EDPS on this topic through sustained formal and informal engagement with key members of its staff. Following publication of the preliminary opinion, she was invited to participate in a closed workshop hosted by the EDPS at the European Parliament in June 2014, designed to develop the ideas set out in the preliminary opinion, and was one of two participants \(the other being US economist, Dr Jan Whittington\) asked to consider “consumer welfare and consumer protection”. In September 2015, she was invited to speak at the EDPS\-European Research Academy’s “Competition rebooted” conference, again to develop these themes. Following publication of the final Opinion, she has continued to engage with the EDPS on this issue, including chairing the keynote conference session in January 2017 where the EDPS launched the Digital Clearing House. The Digital Clearing House is a forum which enables competition, data protection, and consumer protection authorities to meet, exchange insights and discuss best practices, consistent with the third outlined recommendation of the Lynskey research **\[2\] \[3\]**.  The Head of the Private Office of the EDPS has described Lynskey’s research as ""essential"" to the development of its policy in this area, benefitting its understanding of competition and data protection law in three key ways: 

-  ""*The notion of a positive obligation on the part of the European Commission qua competition authority to uphold the Charter of Fundamental Rights* 

-  *Potential of 'media pluralism' rules in merger control to be a model for 'platform pluralism' in digital economy* 

-  *Use of GDPR as a standard to assess whether abuse of dominance has taken place under TFEU Art 102.*"" **\[B\]** 

 **Influencing policy debate and recommendations regarding the assessment of data\-driven mergers and abuses of dominance prohibited by Article 102 TFEU** 

 Following the EDPS initiative, the question of whether and how data protection and competition law intersect became a prominent issue in domestic and international institutions. The House of Lords Select Committee on Communications conducted a broad inquiry into “Regulating in a Digital Environment” in 2018\-19. It dedicated a chapter of its final report to “market concentration”. Lynskey presented oral evidence to the Select Committee based on the conclusions of **\[2\]** and **\[3\]**. These papers argued for increased scrutiny of data\-driven mergers and acquisitions. In particular, they argued that, beyond a competition assessment, such mergers could be made subject to a parallel non\-competition assessment of their impact, using the parallel assessment for media mergers as an analogy. Lynskey’s oral evidence was cited with approval in the final report **\[C\]** and was used to support the recommendation \(paragraphs 148\-9\) that “ *in its review of competition law in the context of digital markets the Government should consider implementing a public\-interest test for data\-driven mergers and acquisitions*”. 

 Subsequently, in August 2020, Lynskey was contacted by the Competition and Markets Authority's Digital Taskforce ""Futures"" workstream, to provide input on the possible establishment of a Digital Markets Unit, a recommendation of the Furman Review. The Digital Taskforce is specifically focused on exploring how digital markets might evolve over the next 5\-10 years. In September 2020, Lynskey participated in an expert interview, during which she again emphasised to the Digital Taskforce the need to include data protection as part of a wider merger assessment **\[2\] \[3\]**. The following month, in a significant shift in UK policy, the new Chief Executive of the CMA announced the intention to amend the merger regime to accommodate a separate assessment of non\-competition concerns such as data protection **\[D\]**. 

 A 2016 House of Lords EU Select Committee report, “Online Platforms and the Digital Single Market” **\[E\]**, also cited evidence submitted by Lynskey and based on research published in **\[1\]**. Regarding the data protection/competition law intersection, the report noted how the dominance of digital platforms and their control of information flows renders it more difficult for individuals to exercise their rights effectively online **\[E**, paragraph 171 **\]**, and lamented the fallacy of relying on individuals to protect their own rights in this hugely complex context **\[E**, paragraph 216 **\]**. 

 Lynskey’s work has also directly informed OECD policy discussions on this topic and the work of its “best practice roundtables”. These are organised by the OECD’s subject\-specialist committees, convened to guide the application of the law in member countries. **\[4\]** is cited several times in a 2017 background report on non\-price effects in merger control **\[F\]**, while Lynskey herself drafted and presented to committee a paper on ""Considering Data Protection in Merger Control Proceedings"" in June 2018 **\[G\]**. This paper was subsequently cited alongside **\[3\]** in the background note to the ""Consumer data rights and competition"" roundtable. 

 In 2020 Lynskey was invited to become a non\-governmental advisor to the International Competition Network, a network of competition authorities, presenting on competition law and data privacy at its inaugural workshop. Additionally, in November 2018, she was the sole UK\-based legal academic invited to provide evidence to the Federal Trade Commission hearings on ""Privacy, Big Data and Competition"" as part of the FTC’s ""Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century""; and in October 2019 she presented on a panel alongside FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra and the now\-EDPS Wojciech Wiewiórowski at the annual meeting of the International Conference of Privacy and Data Protection Commissioners. 

 **Informing the policy positions and building capacity of civil society organisations** 

 The intersection between data protection and competition law, first articulated by this research, has been shown to be of growing relevance to many diverse stakeholders in recent years. Lynskey's engagement has been crucial in bringing this emergent area of law to the attention of civil society organisations, notably BEUC \(the European Consumer Organisation or “Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs”\) and Privacy International, enhancing the effectiveness of their advocacy, and helping them to formulate robust policy positions in response to a rapidly evolving digital environment. 

 Lynskey's academic contribution has helped BEUC, the umbrella group for 44 independent consumer organisations from 32 countries, to bridge the gap between the fields of competition law and data protection law and gain an understanding of the core legal and policy issues at stake, ultimately ensuring it is better able to represent and defend the interests of European consumers. Agustin Reyna, BEUC's Head of Legal and Economic Affairs, highlighted three areas in which the organisation has benefitted: 1\) influencing its position regarding the upcoming review of EU Competition Law, as expressed in the response to the European Commission’s consultation on the “Shaping of Competition Policy for the Digital Era”; 2\) Lynskey's data power research **\[4\] \[5\] \[6\]** has provided BEUC with "" *useful arguments about how to approach enforcement of Article 102 TFEU regarding abuse of dominant position and restriction of competition in digital markets*""; and 3\) her interdisciplinary approach has "" *opened a discussion about how agencies should cooperate to address infringements that could simultaneously lead to the undermining of the fundamental rights to data protection and privacy while at the same time leading to a disruption of competition when practices are applied by dominant undertakings*"" **\[H\]**. 

 Reyna notes that these are just a few examples of how this research has "" *helped \[BEUC\] to develop policy positions to defend the interest of consumers before the EU decision\-makers*"". 

 In 2020 BEUC appointed Lynskey as one of four academic advisors on its “Consumer Protection 2.0” project. This work seeks to reshape consumer protection law to address the challenges of current digital markets. 

 Privacy International has similarly benefitted from Lynskey’s research in its submissions to competition authorities. In its submission to the Federal Trade Commission on privacy, big data, and competition, **\[2\]** and **\[3\]** were cited in support of several key claims: that in a competitive market we should expect that companies would compete to offer privacy\-friendly services, and that market power may be preventing the emergence of such competition **\[I\]**. Her work informed its submissions to the European Commission on “shaping competition law in an era of digitisation” **\[I\]**, while she has also provided an expert statement for inclusion in its submission to the European Commission regarding Google’s proposed acquisition of Fitbit. Lynskey's engagement with Privacy International has also extended to training and capacity\-building initiatives, offering guidance on the data protection/competition law intersection to staff and affiliated students, and leading sessions at the organisation's conferences. Privacy International had not previously had cause to concern itself with competition law and so its engagement with the Lynskey research has been important to navigating these nascent concerns. 

 Overall, Lynskey's research has been crucial to the increased attention to \- and acceptance of \- the relationship between data protection and competition law. This is now beginning to manifest itself in decisional practice, notably so in an apparent shift in stance from the European Commission in its merger decisions. In the Facebook/WhatsApp merger decision \(2014\), it referred to data protection only once and clearly stated that “any privacy\-related concerns flowing from the increased concentration of data within the control of Facebook as a result of the transaction do not fall within the scope of the EU competition law rules but within the scope of the EU data protection rules”. However, in its later Microsoft/LinkedIn decision \(2016\) the Commission refers to data protection on 26 occasions, explicitly acknowledged privacy as “an important parameter of competition” **\[J\]**, and considered the impact of the transaction on consumer privacy **\[J**, paragraph 350 **\]**. 

 The increased scrutiny of Google’s acquisition of Fitbit by competition authorities on the basis of data protection considerations represents further progress and may lead to data protection concerns being factored in before, rather than after, such a data\-driven acquisition.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In 2019, the National Literacy Trust \(NLT\) partnered with the University of Birmingham’s \(UoB\) interdisciplinary ‘Birmingham Stories’ team to **launch a new spin\-out branch**. That the NLT – which supports over 250,000 children annually – partnered with Birmingham Stories is testament to the impact of the team who had long been working with a range of literary organisations to **\(a\)** **enhance confidence and develop empathy in diverse learners; \(b\) influence the work of local, national and international charities; and** **\(c\)** **change teachers’ professional practice by influencing the** **delivery of English curricula and the design of CPD**. The partnership further **influenced the work of the NLT** by **changing its practice and target demographic**, thus contributing to the fulfilment of the organisation’s 2016 ambition to implement a ‘wider definition of reading well’.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Combining their expertise in English Language \(Mahlberg\), Literature \(Rumbold\) and Creative Writing \(Gilligan\), the interdisciplinary Birmingham Stories team came together to reveal how new ways of reading and analysing fiction could generate a more holistic understanding of narrative. The team showed how critically neglected framing devices often shape the relationship between narrator, character and reader, thus affecting our responses to fictional characters; they then applied this research via classroom experiments and creative outputs of their own to analyse these responses in practice. 

 Mahlberg’s AHRC\- and ERC\-funded projects developed and applied the CLiC web app, which facilitates computer\-assisted textual analysis with a specific focus on the distinction between narrative and fictional speech. This analysis brought to light recurring features across Dickens’s novels and other 19<sup>th</sup>\-century texts. For example, it revealed how, contrary to critical opinion, these features — which can be as seemingly inconsequential as the reporting clauses that frame speech \(e.g., ‘she said/cried/shouted’\) — have the capacity to subtly steer readers’ responses. This analysis also revealed the nuanced and authentic patterns found in fictional speech, highlighting its similarity to contemporary everyday speech that previous research had not addressed in this way \(RO1, RO2\). **RF1: Alternative approaches to texts, such as computer\-assisted analysis, can reveal the significance of narrative techniques that are largely ignored or neglected by traditional literary criticism.** 

 Rumbold’s research also focused on the framing of direct speech in fiction: in this case, the numerous overt quotations from literature that feature in 18<sup>th</sup>\-century novels. Contrary to the critical assumption that they were merely decorative additions to a new genre, these quotations played a central role, since characters would frequently directly quote Shakespeare and other authors to illuminate their emotional state. The repeated framing phrases that introduced these quotations \(e.g., ‘as that grand master of human nature, Shakespeare, says …’\) ultimately conferred new emotional authority on Shakespeare himself in the eyes of the novel\-reading public \(RO3\). **RF2: Shakespearean quotations are directly responsible for Shakespeare’s reputation as an emotional authority, having been used by other authors for centuries as a means of illuminating their characters’ emotional state.** 

 Gilligan likewise analysed the use of framing devices and quotation, this time in contemporary novels focused on characters from “other” communities. She formulated a “Narratology of Otherness”, which she applied to the work of bestselling author Colum McCann. In his novel about the Roma community, for example *,* embedded speech, multiple points of view and Roma storytelling tropes allow McCann to offer a more nuanced and empathetic depiction of characters whose cultural backgrounds differ from his own. Gilligan also researched McCann’s commitment to empathy more broadly, including via his storytelling charity Narrative 4 \(RO4\). 

 **RF3: Framing devices and POV can be used to negotiate the ethical challenges of writing about different cultures; this requires an empathetic approach from the author and solicits an empathetic response from the reader, as seen in the work of Colum McCann.** 

 Gilligan then drew on this “Narratology of Otherness” to write her own novel, *Nine Folds Make a Paper Swan*, which was inspired by the Irish\-Jewish community. By incorporating multiple points of view, embedded text and Yiddish storytelling techniques, the novel offered a sensitive and empathetic portrait of ‘characters whose stories have been neglected by \[…\] Irish Literature’ \( *Guardian*\). Gilligan was invited to events across the world \(e.g., Ireland, US, Israel\) to discuss this community and its little\-known history, and was commissioned to write articles on the topic for mainstream international publications \(RO5\). **RF4: Storytelling can raise public awareness around and lead to a more nuanced, empathetic understanding of minority communities.** 

 Finally, the ability of emotionally resonant creative works to engage people on multiple levels was also the focus of Rumbold’s AHRC\-funded ‘Uses of Poetry’ project. Rumbold tested and revealed how, in the present\-day classroom, inviting students first to respond emotionally to literary texts actually deepened — rather than distracted from — their cognitive analysis. Students sought not simply to identify the formal features of the text, but to trace their initial emotional responses to specific verbal choices, and thus to understand the poem more fully by seeing precisely how it had affected them \(RO6\). **RF5: Encouraging emotional responses to literature in the classroom deepens students’ understanding and enhances their analysis of the texts they study.**

###  4. Details of impact 

 **1.** The Birmingham Stories team was responsible for the **creation of a new spin\-out branch of the National Literacy Trust \(NLT\)**. Launched in October 2019 and titled — fittingly — ‘Birmingham Stories’, this branch was the NLT’s **first HEI\-research\-led literacy hub** as well as the **first to prioritise teenagers and adults**. The NLT already had ten hubs across the UK, each designed to tackle the specific literacy needs of particular regions; it had also highlighted, in 2016, the need for ‘a wider definition of reading well’ \(S9\). After observing ‘ **the success of the literacy projects** **arising from Kate, Michaela and Ruth’s research**’, the NLT saw an opportunity to address this need, to target a different demographic and thus to enact change in new ways in Birmingham and beyond \(S1; RF1–RF5\). 

 The Birmingham Stories team had already been delivering in this space through partnerships with literacy organisations, providing a base of work for the NLT to roll out and build upon; specifically, the team had **\(a\)** **enhanced confidence and developed empathy in diverse learners, \(b\) influenced the work of local, national and international charities, and \(c\)** **changed teachers’ professional practice by influencing the** **delivery of English curricula and the design of CPD**. 

1.  **Enhanced confidence and developed empathy in diverse learners** 

 The **confidence and empathy of over 300 diverse teenagers** **was enhanced** by Gilligan running the UK’s first “story exchange” workshops \(RF3, RF4\); **100% said the workshops helped them foster empathy, 97% appreciated diversity more as a result, 88% said they now felt inspired to work for change in their community** \(S2\). Participants said the story exchange — a methodology devised in the US, which culminates in retelling a stranger’s life story *framed* *in the first person* as if it were your own — ‘ **changed the way I think about people from different ethnic backgrounds**’ and ‘ **profoundly** **shaped my view on humanity**’; they also said ‘I’m **more confident** in myself, I **take more pride** in what I do, I’m **much more understanding and empathetic and more sociable**’ \(S2\). Similarly, Rumbold devised adult literacy workshops which not only improved reading skills, but **enhanced emotional skills such as confidence and motivation** \(RF2, RF5\). Participants said: ‘Because of your workshop I have become **much more self\-reflective**’ and ‘ **never did I feel valuable’**, but afterwards ‘I left with a **completely different outlook**’ \(S3\). This impact was achieved by inviting learners to consider Shakespearean quotations through the lens of their own emotions, which in turn enhanced their ability to understand complex texts. Piloted at the Library of Birmingham in 2017, the workshops were rolled out by the Birmingham Adult Education Service and, despite major COVID disruption, have already reached over 100 participants. Tutors praised the workshops’ innovation, noting how Shakespeare’s ‘words resonate with all cultures and backgrounds’, citing ‘ **greater confidence**’ amongst their students who are now ‘ **more motivated**’ \(S3\). 

1.  **Influenced the work of local, national and international charities** 

 **The practice, strategy and reach  of Narrative 4 \(N4\) — a global empathy\-building charity founded by author Colum McCann, which has run over 100,000 story exchanges to date — was **changed by Gilligan** \(RF3, RF4\). As N4’s Director of Global Programs testified: ‘Ruth Gilligan has been **directly responsible for N4’s expansion into the UK and Ireland**’ \(S6\). N4 was already running story exchanges across the US and overseas \(e.g., South Africa, Israel, Palestine\), but had yet to enjoy any presence in the UK; by organising story exchanges in Birmingham and generating media interest \(e.g., an *Irish Times* article in 2016 *,* a 6\-page *Guardian* spread 2018, a Hay Festival talk 2019, a feature\-length documentary which premiered in 2019\), Gilligan **increased N4’s profile** on this side of the Atlantic. This increased profile led to **new funding** \(e.g., from Microsoft Ireland\) and **new partnerships** \(e.g., Tony Blair Faith Foundation and NLT\); meanwhile Gilligan was invited to present her work as an example of best practice to over 500 educators at N4’s global summits \(2018, 2019\), and to feature in N4’s 2020 fundraising event hosted by Sting \(2,395 online views to date\). Finally, in Autumn 2020, N4 formally set up Narrative 4 UK and appointed Gilligan Director thereof. She is now responsible for recruiting, training and mentoring facilitators, and meeting with the COO to discuss strategic plans, once again attesting to **her** **role in the organisation’s overseas development**. 

 Meanwhile, **the practice of Birmingham organisations**, such as the Birmingham Adult Education Service \(BAES\) and Library of Birmingham \(LoB\) was changed by Rumbold \(RF2, RF5\). In the words of BAES’s Head of Curriculum, Rumbold’s Shakespeare\-based workshops ‘ **informed our thinking and practice about the role and value of learners’ emotional engagement** within their formal learning’ and helped these learners to ‘find a greater sense of voice and belonging within the service and beyond’ \(S7\). This led BAES — which works with over 13,000 adults annually — to recruit Rumbold to co\-design a new, emotions\-based Community Learning course. Launching in Spring 2021, this 14\-week service\-wide course is intended to inspire emergent readers — a group BAES had hitherto struggled to engage — to begin reading for enjoyment. By bringing BAES learners to LoB, Rumbold’s Shakespeare workshops also forged a new working relationship between two city\-council\-run organisations that had previously operated almost entirely independently of one another; LoB’s Cultural Partnerships Manager describes how ‘it is thanks to this bold and persistent work that a number of sometimes discrete functions such as the City Archive, Adult Education, and Children’s library services have **recognised new ways of connecting to deliver better services to Birmingham citizens**’ \(S8\). He also observes how Rumbold’s workshops provided an ‘ **innovative and relevant way** **for the library to engage adult learners** in relation to the Shakespeare collection’ while the workshop delivery methods were also new, serving as ‘ **an** **innovative and effective way of incorporating volunteer\-led initiatives into our approach to community engagement and education**, thereby helping us meet our strategic aims as a public institution’ \(S8\). 

1.  **Changed** **teachers’** **professional practice by influencing the** **delivery of English curricula and the design of CPD** 

 **The professional** **practice** **of teachers was changed** via Mahlberg’s freely available CLiC app which brought cutting\-edge digital tools into the English classroom \(RF1\). To date, CLiC has had over 19,370 users worldwide, while the ‘CLiC Activity Book: Supporting the teaching of literature at GCSE and AS/A\-level’ has had over 1,668 international downloads \(S4\). The CLiC blog — which gives users an opportunity to share their experience of using CLiC — has had over 18,837 unique page views \(S4\), and documents how CLiC is being embedded in teaching practice; for example, one English teacher notes in her blog post ‘ **CLiC is now very much a part of my teacher’s toolkit\!**’ \(S5\). Eschewing the traditional focus on small extracts and sometimes decontextualised quotations, CLiC made it possible to take a holistic approach to narrative. It was added to A\-Level resources and teaching guides \(e.g., *The Language of Literature*: *An Introduction to Stylistics* and Hay Levels — a YouTube channel with over 5,500 subscribers\). Given the rapid shift in the National Curriculum, teachers praised how CLiC enabled a ‘more substantive analysis of both character \[and\] theme but also an exploration of contextual significance — all of which are fundamental to understanding the text at GCSE level \[…\] this **exciting new approach** could not have fallen into teachers’ hands at a better time\!’ \(S5\). 

 **The design and delivery of teacher CPD was also changed** due to CLiC. CPD workshops focusing on digital reading skills in the English classroom were designed by Mahlberg; the CLiC team then ran ten workshops for teachers – one specifically for trainee teachers – some of which were then disseminated as examples of best practice via high\-profile teacher conferences \(e.g., Integrating English 2017 and researchEd 2019, 2020\). Meanwhile, the approach was discussed in professional development publications \(e.g., the Chartered College of Teaching magazine *Impact*\) and was integrated into the offering of LitDrive — a teacher\-led initiative providing innovative online CPD resources; as the organisation’s founder testified ‘the \[CLiC\] software demystifies Literature to a greater degree than ever before’ \(S5\).Since 2019, collaborating with the National Literacy Trust \(NLT\) generated further impact for the Birmingham Stories team, who collectively: 

 **2. Influenced the work of the NLT by changing its practice and target demographic** 

 Through Birmingham Stories, **the NLT shifted its traditional hub focus from early years/primary school students to teenagers and adults**. Launching the first hub to prioritise the social and educational inclusion of these neglected demographics was significant since 16.4% of adults in England — or 7.1 million people — can be described as having ‘very poor literacy skills’ \(S9\). This change in target demographic came about because of the Birmingham Stories team’s proven expertise in engaging these groups via story exchange, emotional engagement and digital reading methods, as outlined above \(RF1–5\). This expertise formed the basis of the new hub and ultimately caused the NLT to reconsider its approach to literacy more broadly; as the NLT’s Director of Operations testifies, the Birmingham Stories team had ‘ **a deep and lasting impact on how the National Literacy Trust works and thinks**’ \(S1\). 

 The NLT shifted its focus by **incorporating new methodologies** such as the story exchange to engage Birmingham teenagers from diverse wards. This was ‘ **a first for the NLT**, both in working with teenagers as a new demographic, and also using stories to connect different communities in a city. \[…\] The Story Exchange has **put empathy at the forefront of our thinking locally and nationally**’ \(RF3, RF4\). This came about as a result of Gilligan’s success in the field and led to a programme of exchanges between teenagers from across Birmingham \(2020\) as well as teenagers from different regional hubs \(delayed until 2021 because of COVID\). Meanwhile, to engage adult learners – a group the NLT had rarely targeted in the past – the NLT committed to delivering Rumbold’s Shakespeare workshops to all adults currently studying GCSE English at BAES \(RF2, RF5\). As the Director of Operations explains, Rumbold’s ‘research has not only brought a **new understanding** **on what we mean to read well**, it has **moved us into working with a new demographic**’ \(S1\). As a result, since the co\-creation of Birmingham Stories, the NLT launched a national Adult Literacy Strategy and ‘Kate’s expertise \[…\] has **directly informed this strategy as well as the NLT’s Adult Literacy Working Group’** \(S1\). The Group is now working towards a major ‘State of the Nation’ study of adult literacy in England reporting in 2022, which will directly inform policy via the All\-Party Parliamentary working group, of which the NLT holds the secretariat. Combining the story exchange methodology and the focus on adult literacy, in December 2020 Rumbold and Gilligan ran a story exchange\-based consultation process for the NLT, which allowed adult learners and tutors to share their experiences of reading and learning, before working together to co\-design a new ‘Reading for Enjoyment’ programme \(launching Spring 2021\). The NLT was so impressed by the effectiveness of the story exchange as a consultative ‘tool to better understand communities and their needs’, they announced that ‘the model is **now informing our new national Diversity, Inclusion and Community Engagement strategy**’ \(S1\). 

 The NLT also **updated its existing national programmes aimed at adults and teenagers**, such as its flagship literacy and employability scheme ‘Words for Work’ to reflect a more holistic understanding of readiness for work beyond solely practical skills: ‘Kate’s research into emotions \[…\] has been taken on by our Words for Work employability programme – which has had 6,550 participants to date and 2,900 scheduled for 2021 – who are now using evaluation tools from Kate’s research to understand the emotional impact of the programme’ \(S1\). Meanwhile, recognising the role technology plays in how today’s teenagers approach reading, the NLT **drew on Mahlberg’s digital expertise to update its offering**. In 2020, for example, the NLT piloted a ‘new kind of competition’ which included CLiC\-based materials to support the students in writing stories around the theme of ‘Heroes’ \(S1\). With 530 participants in total, teachers praised how the competition gave students a ‘chance to spread their wings’, made ‘creative writing feel more real’ and ‘definitely motivated the writers and boosted their confidence’ \(S5\). The NLT also updated Literacy for Learning — its whole\-school literacy improvement programme for secondary teachers and leaders, which has reached 301 participants since October 2019 — to include CPD designed by Mahlberg, focusing on digital tools in the English classroom \(RF1\). 

 Finally, in order to achieve all of the above, the NLT **changed its approach to how it establishes its literacy hubs**, which included devising a **new ‘Theory of Change’** **and** **governance structure**. The latter means Birmingham Stories is the first literacy hub to include both a Senior Steering Group \(with Rumbold as co\-chair\) and a Research Committee \(with Gilligan as co\-chair\), reflecting the fact that it is the only hub to be directly guided by research generated outside of the NLT \(S1\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Immunotherapy is now an established pillar of cancer treatment, improving the outcomes of patients with a wide variety of cancers. Professors James Larkin and Kevin Harrington at The Institute of Cancer Research \(ICR\) have facilitated the international approval and use of a range of immunotherapies through their roles as investigators in clinical trials, and by providing expert clinical opinion at regulatory committee review meetings. These immunotherapies include: 

-  **Ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab** for the treatment of advanced melanoma; 

-  **Avelumab in combination with axitinib** for the treatment of renal cancer; 

-  **Nivolumab** as a second\-line therapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer; 

-  **Pembrolizumab** as a first\-line treatment in head and neck cancer; and 

-  **Talimogene laherparepvec** \(trade name T\-VEC\) for treating inoperable metastatic melanoma—the first approved oncolytic virus therapy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background.** Over the last 10 years, clinical development of immunotherapies has led to significant advances in cancer treatment: 

 1. Immune checkpoints are critical regulators of the immune system, preventing it from targeting cells indiscriminately. Cancers frequently exploit these checkpoints to subvert the immune system and evade detection. Inhibiting these immune checkpoints therefore helps restore immune function in cancer patients. This case study focuses on: 

  -  Ipilimumab—an inhibitor of cytotoxic T\-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 \(CTLA\-4\); 

  -  Avelumab—which inhibits programmed death\-ligand 1 \(PD\-L1\); 

  -  Nivolumab and pembrolizumab—which inhibit the programmed death 1 \(PD\-1\) receptor. 

 2. Oncolytic virus therapies use genetically modified viruses, designed to specifically target cancer cells. This case study focuses on Talimogene laherparepvec \(T\-VEC\)—a modified form of herpes simplex virus type\-1 which has been genetically engineered to stimulate the immune system to attack and destroy the tumour. 

 **Immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma.** CTLA\-4 and PD\-1 inhibit antitumour immunity through complementary and non\-redundant mechanisms. Therefore, it was thought that there could be a clinical benefit in combining inhibitors that target these two checkpoints, which was further supported by preclinical and early phase studies. Professor James Larkin—ICR Honorary Faculty and Reader from 2015 \(Professor from 2018\)—working with Bristol\-Myers Squibb, developed and led a randomised double\-blind phase 3 study of nivolumab \(a PD\-1 inhibitor\) plus ipilimumab \(a CTLA\-4 inhibitor\), compared to nivolumab or ipilimumab alone, in patients with metastatic melanoma. The trial involved 137 sites in Australia, Europe, Israel, New Zealand, and North America, and a total of 945 patients. The study found median progression\-free survival for nivolumab plus ipilimumab was 11.5 months, compared to 6.9 months for nivolumab alone, and 2.9 months for ipilimumab alone **\(Ref. 1\)**. The five\-year survival outcomes from this trial were published in 2019—overall survival at five years was 52% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 44% for nivolumab alone, and 26% for ipilimumab alone. For context, advanced melanoma has historically had a five\-year survival rate of less than 10%. 

 In an effort to improve the outcomes of patients with stage 3 melanoma and patients with surgically resected stage 4 melanoma \(who are generally excluded from phase 3 trials of adjuvant therapy\), Professor Larkin also jointly led the phase 3 CheckMate 238 trial, and showed that treatment with nivolumab is superior to the standard of care in high\-risk patients with resected stage 3B–C or 4 melanoma. Nivolumab also had a lower rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, compared to adjuvant therapy with ipilimumab. This trial was designed, overseen, and analysed through collaboration between Professor Larkin, other senior academic authors, and Bristol\-Myers Squibb **\(Ref. 2\)**. 

 **Immune checkpoint inhibitors in renal cancer.** Following previous studies that showed activity of avelumab \(a PD\-L1 inhibitor\) in renal\-cell carcinoma, it was hypothesised that the combination of avelumab and axitinib \(a VEGF\-targeted antiangiogenic therapy\) might have clinical benefit, as the drugs have complementary mechanisms of action. The JAVELIN Renal 101 phase 3 trial—sponsored by Pfizer—was developed to test this hypothesis. Professor Larkin and other investigators worked with Pfizer on the trial design, the collection and analysis of data, and interpretation of results. The trial **\(Ref. 3\)** demonstrated that: 

-  Patients with PD-L1-positive tumours had a median progression\-free survival of 13.8 months with avelumab plus axitinib, compared to 7.2 months with the standard of care. 

-  In the overall population, patients had a median progression\-free survival of 13.8 months with avelumab plus axitinib, compared to 8.4 months with the standard of care, and a higher objective response rate. 

 **Immune checkpoint inhibitors in head and neck cancer.** Patients with relapsed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck \(HNSCC\) that progress within six months of first\-line chemotherapy have a poor prognosis—and previously had limited therapeutic options to prolong survival. It was known that the recurrence of HNSCC is facilitated by immune evasion and, therefore, it was hypothesised that immune checkpoint inhibitors could be effective in these cancers. The ICR’s Professor Harrington was involved in the CheckMate 141 clinical trial, which found that nivolumab increased survival of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC cancer **\(Ref. 4\)**. The trial was designed and overseen by the academic authors, including Professor Harrington, in collaboration with Bristol\-Myers Squibb. Professor Harrington also led a study into the effect of nivolumab on patient\-reported outcomes from the CheckMate 141 trial, which showed that patients on nivolumab gave consistently better patient\-reported outcomes ratings throughout. Due to the importance of improving quality of life for these patients, these data support nivolumab as a new standard of care in this setting **\(Ref. 5\)**. 

 Professor Harrington co\-led the KEYNOTE\-040 study which showed that pembrolizumab provides a clinically meaningful survival benefit in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC that progressed during or after platinum\-based therapy. This therapy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) and European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) based on the results of this trial. The indication was not pursued by NICE due to results from KEYNOTE\-048 \(see below\). With the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC demonstrated, it was hypothesised a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy in the first\-line setting would be synergistic, as chemotherapy leads to immunogenic cell death and antigen shedding. Professor Harrington led the UK arm of the KEYNOTE\-048 phase 3 trial—funded by Merck—which found that, in previously untreated recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy combination improved overall survival compared to cetuximab with chemotherapy \(13.0 months compared to 10.7 months\) **\(Ref. 6\)**. Professor Harrington played a leading role in conceiving, designing, and planning the study alongside Professor Barbara Burtness \(Yale\), Dr Jonathan D Cheng \(Merck\), and Dr Fan Jin \(Merck\). 

 **Talimogene laherparepvec \(T\-VEC\) in melanoma.** Professor Harrington treated melanoma patients with T\-VEC in the initial phase 1 trial \(Hu Clin. Cancer Res. 2006\), which then led to a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with melanoma, in which Professor Harrington was the UK Principal Investigator \(Senzer et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 2009\). Professor Harrington then led the UK arm of a landmark phase 3 trial—the first to show the benefit of viral immunotherapy for patients with unresected stage 3B to 4 melanoma **\(Ref. 7\)**. In this trial, patients treated with T\-VEC had a 21% reduced risk of death and, 4.4\-month longer median overall survival compared to the control group. This culminated in global approval of the treatment.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma.** Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 4% of all new cancer cases and approximately 2,300 deaths annually **\[A\]**. Until 2012, the standard therapy for advanced melanoma in the UK was dacarbazine chemotherapy when the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) recommended two new therapies—ipilimumab and vemurafenib for BRAF\-mutant melanoma \(a focus of one of our UOA5 impact case studies\). In 2016, NICE approved nivolumab for the treatment of advanced melanoma \(TA384\)—this approval was based on data from the CheckMate 066, CheckMate 067 **\(Ref. 1\)**, and CheckMate 03 trials: 

 *“The Committee agreed that the low toxicity and the favourable adverse effects profile of nivolumab compared with other treatments represent a promising new advance in immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.”* **\[B\]** 

 In July 2016, NICE recommended nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab \(TA400\)—based on data from CheckMate 067 **\(Ref. 1\)** —as the combination is more effective than ipilimumab alone. Professor Larkin was nominated \(by the charity Melanoma Focus\) to be one of two clinical experts that attended the NICE Committee Appraisal meeting that resulted in this decision. In this meeting, Professor Larkin made the case that the combination represented a step\-change in the management of melanoma, due to its unprecedented clinical benefit **\[C\]**. The NICE recommendation led to a rapid increase in the prescribing rates of ipilimumab **\[D\]**. 

 Just 10 years ago, less than 10% of patients with advanced melanoma would survive for five years. The impact of CheckMate 067 has been remarkable—the five\-year follow\-up was published in 2019 and showed sustained long\-term survival in approximately 50% of patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Pamela Smith, 67, joined the Checkmate 067 trial in January 2014 soon after finding out that her melanoma had spread. Pamela said: 

 *“It was inoperable, so the trial was my only option. I’d been having treatment every two weeks for about four months when I developed diarrhoea that was so bad I had to come off treatment. Amazingly, the first scan and every scan since has shown that in that relatively short time, it worked. My tumour shrank to less than half its original size and it hasn’t changed in five years. I’ve not had any treatment since and I feel brilliant.”* **\[E\]** 

 The impact from these treatments has not been confined to the UK. In January 2016, the FDA approved nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in unresectable or metastatic melanoma, again on the basis of data from the CheckMate 067 trial **\(Ref. 1\)** —the first FDA\-approved combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors. As of 2019, the combination is approved in more than 50 countries **\[F\]**. Professor Larkin contributed to the approval of the combination in Europe by attending the EMA CHMP Oral Explanation in January 2016. In 2017, the FDA and EMA approved adjuvant treatment with nivolumab based on the CheckMate 238 trial **\(Ref. 2\)** —the first PD\-1 therapy to receive EMA approval in the adjuvant setting. In the European Union, the therapy now has eight indications, across six distinct tumour types **\[F\]**. 

 **Impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors in renal cancer.** In 2018, an estimated 136,500 new cases of renal cancer were diagnosed in Europe, and approximately 54,700 people died from the disease—there is a significant need for additional treatment options, particularly for advanced disease where the five\-year survival rate is 12%. In May 2019, the FDA approved the combination of avelumab with axitinib based on the JAVELIN Renal 101 results **\(Ref. 3\)** and EMA approval followed in October 2019 **\[G\]**. Avelumab with axitinib is now also recommended for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund for untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma \(TA645\). 

 **Impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors in head and neck cancer.** In 2018, there were approximately 705,000 cases of HNSCC diagnosed worldwide, with over 358,000 deaths from the disease **\[H\]**. In December 2016, the FDA approved nivolumab in recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, on the basis of the CheckMate 141 trial data **\(Ref. 4** and **Ref. 5\)**. In April 2017, EMA approval followed. In October 2017, nivolumab was recommended for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund for some HNSCC patients—in the NICE review process, Professor Harrington provided expert clinical opinion, and it was highlighted that nivolumab is better tolerated than docetaxel and that most patients report a higher quality of life with nivolumab **\[I\]**. 

 In June 2019, the FDA approved pembrolizumab as a first\-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy in HNSCC **\[H\]**, based on the KEYNOTE\-048 trial **\(Ref. 6\)**. In October 2019, EMA approval followed. Pembrolizumab was the first anti\-PD\-1 treatment option in the first\-line setting for metastatic or unresectable recurrent HNSCC—the first new therapies approved in the EU for more than a decade. Since October 2020, pembrolizumab monotherapy is recommended on the NHS as an option for untreated metastatic or unresectable recurrent HNSCC expressing PD-L1 \(TA661\) based on the results from the KEYNOTE\-048 trial. 

 **Impact of Talimogene laherparepvec \(T\-VEC\) as a treatment for melanoma.** In 2015, the FDA and EMA approved T\-VEC as a treatment for advanced melanoma as a direct result of the phase 3 trial **\(Ref. 7\)** —this was the first FDA\- and EMA\-approved oncolytic virus therapy. In 2016, NICE approved the use of T\-VEC for treating inoperable metastatic melanoma in adults, when systemically administered immunotherapies are not suitable. The committee concluded that the availability of a new treatment option with a novel mechanism of action and improved tolerability would be valuable for people with metastatic melanoma **\[J\]**. As part of the review process, Professor Harrington was nominated to attend the initial committee discussion and provide a written statement, giving clinical evidence to support the committee’s decision making. In clinical practice, treatment with T\-VEC is suitable for approximately 10% to 15% of people with unresectable metastatic melanoma. The committee considered T\-VEC to be cost effective compared with dacarbazine \(GBP23,900 per quality\-adjusted life year \(QALY\) gained\) and best supportive care \(GBP24,100 per QALY gained\) in people whose disease was not suitable for treatment with systemically administered immunotherapies **\[J\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Edinburgh Napier University \(ENU\) has led to new ways of creating contemporary church music. Harris has commissioned composers, created a new record label, and has recorded CDs featuring the Choir of St. Giles’ Cathedral, Edinburgh. This has led to novel contributions from British composers to the field of church music.The research has had a beneficial reputational and commercial influence on St Giles’ Cathedral, receiving acknowledgment of its influence on the atmosphere for the cathedral’s 1.4million estimated annual visitors. The choir has also performed the created music on international tours, and the record label has sold almost 1,500 CD copies.The work has also informed the practices of composers and influenced national and international concert audiences via the BBC. Commissioned work was performed on BBC Radio 3, and CD releases, including *O Clap Your Hands,* have provided an international platform for composers to redefine church music.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the exception of very few contemporary works, much of the music used in worship by churches in the UK was written between the 16<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. This has often led to a reductive view of church music by both congregations and the wider public. As a result, churches and performers have often struggled for relevance and exposure in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. In an attempt to reverse this trend, the underpinning research has focused on improving the breadth and diversity of contemporary church music. 

 Michael Harris is a Lecturer at ENU and Master of the Music at St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, one of the largest and most renowned churches in Scotland. He has led this research body with contributions from fellow lecturer and composer Stewart Murray Mitchell. 

 Harris has developed a self\-termed “Edinburgh model” **\[O1,O2\]** for the reinvigoration of church music, based on his work with St Giles Cathedral. He has provided composers with opportunities to work in the domain of church music, requiring compositions to consider worshipping congregations and their attitudes towards ‘new’ music. The purpose of sacred music in this context is to enhance the act of worship, effecting a change of emotion in the listener and contributing to their religious or spiritual experience. This ‘new’ music also engages with a new generation of churchgoers, who may have previously considered church music to be outmoded or prosaic. 

 In 2014, Harris commissioned two Edinburgh\-based composers, Stuart Murray Mitchell, who became a PhD student and lecturer at ENU a year later, and Chris Hutchings, to compose two new works for the Cathedral Choir with funding from The Friends of the Music of St Giles’ Cathedral **\[P1\]**. The resultant works, *Five Introits* and *O Praise the Lord Ye Angels of His,* fulfilled two purposes; to create a group of introits that could be used throughout the liturgical year, and an anthem to enhance the experience of the worshipping congregation **\[O2\]**. 

 Following these successful compositions, Harris programmed a similar series of works by renowned living composers in both a liturgical and in a concert setting. The result has been a series of recordings created by high\-profile composers and performed by the Cathedral Choir **\[O3, O4\]**. 

 As a result of this initial research, Harris secured subsequent funding from The Friends of the Music of St Giles’ Cathedral to commission a number of new works from internationally renowned musicians. Rory Boyle’s *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2, O4\]** *,* Ann Millikan’s *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]** *,* and Jonathan Pitkin’s *As Kingfishers Catch Fire* **\[P4, O6\]** are further new compositions which have been recorded for worship and used for concerts at St Giles’, performed by the Cathedral Choir and the organist at that time, Peter Backhouse.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2014 this research has benefitted composers, St Giles’ Cathedral, and the St Giles’ Cathedral choir, and has reached national and international audiences. It has: \(i\) developed stimuli to cultural tourism and contributed to the quality of the tourist experience at St Giles, which attracts around 1.4million visitors per year; \(ii\) enhanced the reputation and commercial income of St Giles; and \(iii\) enhanced the quality of life for composers, performers, and audiences of church music. 

 **Growing International Audiences and Increasing Tourist Visitors to St. Giles’ Cathedral** 

 Harris’ programming of new works has led to a number of novel concerts and recitals by the Cathedral Choir and their organist **\[O1\-O6\]**.  This has enhanced the reputation of the Cathedral as a forward\-thinking institution that highly values its contribution to both worship and culture. The choir performed the commissioned work in tours in Germany in 2015 and the United States in 2017, thus enhancing their international profile. Information on the tours is provided below:

-  *Preston Toccata* – Ann Millikan 

  -  13<sup>th</sup> May 2017, St Giles’ Cathedral, Edinburgh 

  -  2<sup>nd</sup> August, 2017, St Giles’ Cathedral, Edinburgh 

 Furthermore, these new works have been used regularly in services of worship to a congregation comprising a diverse cross\-section of the public. These include those who do not regularly attend concerts featuring contemporary music, in addition to the large number of tourists who attend services at St Giles’ Cathedral due to its central location in Edinburgh’s Old Town. In her letter detailing the number of visitors to the Cathedral, Sarah Phemister, Head of Heritage and Culture at St. Giles’, outlines how ‘ *Michael’s work on our music programme has a tremendous impact…The popularity of our music programme, and the strong reputation it has developed under Michael’s stewardship, ensures that we often attract large crowds to these events*’ and that ‘ *no less significant, is the role of the music programme in fostering a welcoming atmosphere in St. Giles’’* **\[C6\]**. 

 **Launch of the Aegidius Record Label and Commercial and Reputational Benefit to St. Giles Cathedral** 

 In 2014, as a result of his research, Harris was responsible for creating the Cathedral’s new record label, Aegidius, with the launch of its first two compact discs; *O Clap Your Hands* and *On Christmas Night*. This was featured in the pages of *The Herald* newspaper \(estimated weekly readership 91,000, 2014\) **\[C4\]** and the first CD received a four\-star review in *Choir and Organ* magazine. The review by Shirley Ratcliffe stated: ‘ *St. Giles’s excellent Cathedral Choir directed by Michael Harris is in fine voice for a programme of sacred music written between 1914 and 2014’* **\[C3\]** and makes specific reference to the commissioning of new works by Stuart Murray Mitchell and Chris Hutchings. 

 The raison d'être of both discs **\[O3, O4\]** was to further the reputation of the Cathedral Choir and to solidify its commitment to enhancing the reputation of Scottish church music. As a result of the collaboration, St Giles’ Cathedral is one of only four cathedrals in Scotland who have commercially available recordings. As the first of these discs, *O Clap Your Hands* **\[O3\]**, comprises only works written between 1914\-2014, it provides a valuable snapshot of British liturgical choral music over the past century, and celebrates the diversity of church music which is still very much apparent today. 

 The second disc, *On Christmas Night*, similarly features a number of works from living composers, namely Cecilia McDowall, Gabriel Jackson, and Matthew Owens in addition to early\-career composer, Andrew Carvel. Along with a third release, *The Auld Alliance: Organ Music from Scotland and France*, and a fourth release, *Laudate Dominum: Sing Praises to God\!* **\[O4\]**, which features Boyle’s *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P4\]**, the label has sold nearly 1,500 copies of its releases to date **\[C2\]**. In a letter from David W. S. Todd, President of the The Friends of the Music of St. Giles’ Cathedral, he outlines how profits from the sales of Aegidius releases have been used to fund new recordings and commission more new works for choir and organ over the next five years. Todd states how *‘these commissions will be important and significant additions to the repertoire for Cathedral/Church choirs and, because, the funds from the Friends are self\-generating they can also be recorded and these will add greatly to the value of the commissions. The Friends commend this model of funding, commissioning, performing and recording new works*.’ **\[C7\]**. 

 **Influence on Composers and Their Contribution to the Musical Canon** 

 Through the commissioning process Harris has facilitated an expansion of contemporary church music repertoire. This includes three works suitable as anthems \( *O Praise the Lord Ye Angels of His, O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2\]** *, As Kingfishers Catch Fire* **\[P4, O6\]**\), a collection of introits \( *Five Introits* **\[O2\]**\), and an organ voluntary \( *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]**\), all of which demonstrate the vibrancy of contemporary church music. Furthermore, a number of works, particularly *Five Introits* **\[O2\]** and *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2\]** *,* were composed with the amateur musician in mind, allowing them to be subsumed into numerous church repertoires from cathedrals to smaller institutions.As a composer, Mitchell explains how Harris’s ‘ *championing of new music has had a profound effect on my own work. The subsequent recording of two of the introits afforded me with evidence of my output, in turn, aiding its dissemination to a wider audience through sales of the CD around the UK and abroad. Furthermore, these recordings have provided me with a vital artefact which attests to my experience in writing for choir, bolstering prospective opportunities for commissioning by other organisations and individuals’* **\[C8\]**. 

 Whilst the majority of new commissions utilise choral forces with or without accompaniment and feature a sacred text, *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]** is a solo organ work based on two traditional bagpipe tunes, celebrating the union between Scotland and France. The world premiere was performed by Harris and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 16 June 2017 **\[C5\]**. While the BBC are unable to share audience figures for individual programmes, its weekly reach for that quarter was 2.046m **\[C9\].** Millikan writes how *‘\[t\]he impact of Preston Toccata on my career has been a great deal of international exposure, particularly in the UK, which is ongoing. The score for Preston Toccata has been purchased by organists in England and in the United States, including a PhD student who plans to record the work as part of a project supported by Theodore Presser. Michael Harris’ commitment to new music is making a difference in the lives of musicians, composers, and audiences, internationally. His stunning performance of Preston Toccata is something I will never forget’* **\[C9\]**. 

 Due to the favourable reception of his work thus far, Harris has commissioned a further group of composers to write works for the Cathedral Choir, which will subsequently be recorded and performed in various recitals and concerts throughout the world. This five\-year project is funded by the Friends of the Music of St Giles’ and Creative Scotland and involves the internationally recognised composers James Macmillan, Savourna Stevenson, Ken Dempster, Tom Harrold, and Helen Grime.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Paul Webb’s research on British political party members has substantially informed and contributed to the parties’ own understanding of their memberships, and media coverage of party politics. The primary evidence that it has boosted the beneficiaries’ \(i.e. parties’ and the media’s\) awareness and understanding of this subject lies in: \(1\) the frequency with which the research has been used by media for their output, and \(2\) the attention it has gained from the parties themselves, in the form of invited presentations to party conferences and professional staff, and further commissioned research designed to shape their political strategies. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The ESRC\-funded Party Members Project \(PMP\) is the most extensive study of British party members ever undertaken. The project commissioned YouGov to survey members of 6 parties after the 2015, 2017 and 2019 election campaigns; Labour members in 2016; Labour\-affiliated trade union members in 2015; and partisan identifiers in that same year. PMP also surveyed Conservative and Labour members on Brexit in December 2018, and Conservative members on the leadership election in May 2019. In addition, several dozen interviews with party officials and politicians were conducted. The quantitative analysis, which was central to this project, was led and conducted by Webb, as Co\-I. This body of work builds on previous research on Conservative Party members conducted by Webb and Bale in 2013\-14. 

 Key findings relate to: the identity of members \(and non\-member supporters\) in terms of demographic and attitudinal profiles; why they join parties; what they do for their parties in election campaigns; why Labour’s membership surged so dramatically after the 2015 general election; what members think about party leaders, intra\-party procedures and relationships; and why some eventually leave parties. Of particular note are the following findings: 

1.  Non\-member supporters do as much campaign work as members in total, but members remain more important for high\-intensity activities such as canvassing \[R1\]; 

1.  the well\-known ‘General Incentives Model’ of party membership, first developed and tested in the early 1990s, still broadly holds today \[R2\], but factors specific to local constituency and party contexts also contribute significantly to understanding the campaign activity of members, especially in respect of traditional ‘offline’ as opposed to ‘online’ activity \[R3\]; 

1.  the most ‘intensive’ forms of membership activity depend in significant part on those members who either seek a career in politics or are embedded in social networks based around their local parties \[R4\]; 

1.  Labour’s membership surge after 2015 was driven in part by the society’s ‘educated left\-behinds’ \(ie, economically insecure graduates – \[R5\]\); 

1.  when members leave political parties, it is usually over perceptions of ideological distance from, and disillusionment with, the leadership \[R6\]; and 

1.  Conservative members increasingly came to favour ‘Hard Brexit’ after 2015, while Labour’s membership overwhelmingly disapproved of Brexit, the UK’s departure from the Single European Market and EU Customs Union, even though the party leadership initially embraced all of these positions in 2017 \[R6\]. 

 Webb has been fully involved with the design of the project and surveys as an equal partner and has taken primary responsibility for quantitative analysis of data. He was lead\-author on R1\-R4, and co\-author of the monograph \[R6\]. Thus, his contribution has been central to material that has been disseminated to the media and parties – even when he has not been the team member directly engaging with media. After the initial funding period ended, ESRC awarded additional funding that enabled the PMP team to run further surveys following the 2019 general election.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Political parties are an integral component of the UK system of representative democracy. It is therefore no surprise that the parties, the media and politically\-engaged citizens seek accurate and detailed information about who the members are, why they join and leave parties, what they think, and what they do for the parties. This research has provided the contemporary baseline for public knowledge and debate about the demographics, attitudes and activities of party members in Britain today: figures from the project have become ‘the facts’ used by the media and by politicians themselves, as well as by other researchers, academic and non\-academic. 

 The significance of the PMP’s impact can be demonstrated by reference to two direct beneficiary groups: \(1\) political journalists, who have reported the findings directly, using them to inform their own political analysis, and who have commissioned work by the researchers; and \(2\) political parties, whose staff have sought to understand the findings and apply them to their membership and electoral strategies. Each of these is a conduit to broader public awareness. The reach of PMP’s impact can be demonstrated by: \(1\) the very large readerships and viewerships of the media sources \(including social media\) exploiting the project findings, and \(2\) the leading party politicians and national officers who acknowledge the impact of the research. 

 **Impact on journalists’ and their audiences’ understanding** 

 Impact has been achieved through media engagement, including articles written for *The Times, The Observer, The Independent, The Daily Telegraph, The Financial Times, The New Statesman, The Huffington Post, The Monkey Cage, Prospect* and *Political Insight* magazines, and various blogs. Since the project’s inception, the team has authored 47 published articles \(of which Webb has been co\-author 22 times\), and at least 60 articles referencing PMP findings have been published in a wide range of national and overseas media outlets. The PMP team have made more than 20 broadcast media appearances on BBC News, Sky News, Radio 4, LBC and the BBC Parliament Channel, including an episode of BBC Parliament Channel’s *Booktalk* dedicated to the *Footsoldiers* book \[R6\]. All of these contributions \[outlined in S1\] have depended heavily on Webb’s quantitative research. 

 Webb’s research has enhanced the media’s understanding, analysis and reporting of this topic. The research has provided evidence about the demographic and attitudinal profiles of party memberships, the relationships between leaders and members, and the reasons behind phenomena such as the huge surge in Labour Party membership after 2015. The media have used Webb’s findings to inform their coverage of party leadership contests \(Labour in 2015, 2016 and 2020, Conservatives in 2016 and 2019, Liberal Democrats in 2019\), and the debate about Brexit. This impact is not limited to the UK media: see, for instance, Luke McGee’s piece for CNN on the Tory leadership contest of 2019, or Yasmeen Serhan’s piece for *The Atlantic* about the same contest, both of which draw heavily on and directly cite *Footsoldiers* \[R6\] \[S1\]. 

 Some examples illustrate the significance of Webb’s contribution via PMP to the media debate: In his *Guardian* article \(16 September 2017\), Nick Cohen draws on PMP findings to argue that the surge in Labour membership has been driven in part by the frustrations and resentments of a ‘left\-behind middle class’, which is very closely connected with PMP’s concept of the ‘educated left\-behinds’ \[R5\]. In a *Guardian* article \(27 July 2016\), Owen Jones cites Webb’s research on Labour’s electorate, to show that it is ‘unrepresentative of the population’, because middle\-class professionals make up half of Labour Party members. He urges Labour leaders to adopt a strategy to ‘recruit and give leadership positions to underrepresented working\-class people, particularly in the north’. This may or may not be sound advice, but it is unlikely this analysis would have come about without PMP’s research findings on Labour’s grassroots. 

 In a notable contribution, PMP ran the first survey after the 2017 General Election that revealed how Labour Party members were overwhelmingly against Brexit, and in favour of the UK remaining in the Single European Market and Customs Union. *The Guardian’s* Anushka Asthana \(17 July 2017\) reported this finding and it was immediately re\-Tweeted by the then\-leading Labour anti\-Brexiteer, Chuka Umunna, among others – thus informing and shaping the debate about Brexit both within parties and beyond. In December 2018, PMP ran a detailed survey of the attitudes of Conservative and Labour members on Brexit \[R6\]. The research was able to demonstrate that positions on Brexit distinguished the two parties’ membership far more starkly than their positions on any other issues. These findings were widely reported across numerous media outlets during \(and after\) January 2019, ranging from *The Guardian* to *The Mirror*, and the broadcast media. Several items at the time of the Conservative leadership election of 2019 made heavy use of Webb’s PMP research. 

 In *The Guardian* \(21 June 2019\), Pegge & Duncan’s account of the demographic and attitudinal profile of the Tory members who would elect the new Prime Minister drew heavily and directly on Webb’s research, as did Paul Waugh’s detailed article in *The Financial Times* \(22 June 2019\). Similarly, Chuka Ummuna’s critical analysis of Boris Johnson’s candidacy \( *The Independent*, 24 June 2019\) made use of Webb’s research regarding the Tory membership. In January 2020, PMP released details of the first survey of Labour members about their views of candidates in the then\-forthcoming leadership contest, which received heavy coverage \(especially Sky News *The Guardian* and *The New Statesman*\), including overseas. Moreover, the survey is considered to have impacted on the betting market, with odds on Starmer \(the leader in PMP’s poll\) to win reducing radically in his favour after the research was reported \[S7\]. Similarly, PMP produced the first poll pertaining to the Liberal Democrat leadership contest in 2020, which was quickly picked up by the *New Statesman.* 

 Statements from 11 national journalists \[S2\] emphatically attest to the significance of PMP research for their work. For example, Stephen Bush of *The New Statesman* says ‘…the Project has provided us with all sorts of valuable insights into an area of political life in this country that previously we’d only really been able to make guesses about.  As a result, we’ve been able to tell our audience much more about what people at the grassroots think and do, and that’s made a valuable contribution to our coverage of big issues like Brexit, of elections, and leadership contests’ \[S2.1\]. Zoe Williams of *The Guardian* confirms she ‘use\[s\] the data constantly, not just because I know it to be robust and reliable in support of arguments but as a kicking\-off point’ \[S2.2\]. Kishan Koria of ITV’s *Peston* says ‘Work conducted by the Project has helped us produce graphics for agenda\-setting items with findings often put directly to the decision makers who appear on the programme. Their work has really helped our audience \(which during recent times of high political interest has often been 0.7\-1m people\) understand what's been going on during a particularly turbulent time for British politics’ \[S2.3\]. Matt Chorley of *The Times* says ‘The Party Members’ Project is a brilliant resource, which provides a rich stream of properly researched insight into who grassroots members are, their priorities and values. This has been especially useful during the many leadership elections we have had in recent years, helping our readers and listeners to develop a deeper understanding of these contests, and their likely outcomes’ \[S2.4\]. Sam Coates of *Sky News* says, ‘It’s a unique project that has a clear public interest, clear impact, betters understanding of key areas and is very simple for large numbers of people to understand and benefit from, via our reporting of it’ \[S2.5\]. 

 The extensive media coverage of the research – given the size of the reader and viewer audiences involved \[S1\] – has enabled PMP’s research to inform readers on an extensive scale. For example, Nick Cohen’s *Guardian* article attracted 4659 Facebook downloads and 856 comments. An article citing PMP work in the *Independent* by Ashley Cowburn \(8 September 2017\) was shared 739 times on social media, attracting 439 comments. Anushka Asthana’s *Guardian* article was shared 8259 times, attracting 1386 comments; she cited the evidence again in a subsequent article \(24 July 2017\) which was shared 938 times and attracted 4236 comments – and then was cited again by Polly Toynbee \(25 July 2017\), shared 3961 times on Facebook, attracting 2565 comments. An article written by the PMP team for the BBC Website in May 2019 attracted more than 1.1 million views \[see Tom Edgington statement, S2.11\]. 

 Analysis of social media responses to the project \[S3\] shows that the PMP has reached a wide and engaged audience on Twitter and Facebook. On Facebook, the number of PMP article shares steadily increased to nearly 20,000 over the course of the project, with the number of comments and reactions increasing to over 60,000 for each measure, which demonstrates that users are engaging with the material \[S3, Figure 1\]. The analysis set out in S3 also shows that the average reach of journalists tweeting PMP work is 175,001, and calculates that PMP\-related articles have appeared on Twitter users’ feeds over 8.5 million times in 2019\-2020 alone. 

 **Impact on political parties’ strategies and parliamentary processes** 

 Political parties have used Webb’s PMP research to inform their understanding, policy and practice. This was deliberately facilitated through a number of activities and presentations to the parties, and one substantial non\-technical report that summarised many of the key findings for distribution to all MPs \(as well as major media outlets\) –  [*Grassroots*](https://esrcpartymembersprojectorg.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grassroots-pmp_final.pdf) \(2018\). The team has disseminated key findings to Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Green Party of England & Wales \(GPEW\) in face\-to\-face briefings and presentations to head office professionals. In addition, presentations have been delivered to the annual conferences of the Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Green parties and UKIP, to the London Liberal Democrats’ annual conference, and to public events organised by the Electoral Reform Society, and the Social Market Foundation. Webb featured prominently in all but two of these party presentations \(the Conservative and UKIP conferences\). In all, the team has undertaken more than a dozen direct engagements with political parties to inform them of its research. 

 Corroborating statements and evidence pertaining to these activities are collated in \[S4\]. These include evidence from Iain McNicol, Labour’s General Secretary from 2011\-18 \[S4.1\]: ‘The qualitative and quantitative analysis the team set out contributed to our HQ’s understanding of members’ preferences and priorities’; Anita Boateng, special advisor to the Conservative Party Chair \[S4.2\]: PMP ‘proved a really useful additional contribution to our understanding of our members and potential members, and helped inform our strategy going forward’; and Mark Pack, President of the Liberal Democrats \[S4.3\]: ‘The Party Members Project is an invaluable source of insight into party membership, providing information that goes well beyond the internal data held by the Liberal Democrats… It has repeatedly influenced decisions we have taken about our approach to recruiting and mobilising members’. Pack also published a review of *Footsoldiers* in which he asserted the importance of its messages about membership recruitment and mobilization. Liberal Democrat Federal Board member William Dyer published an article in the Liberal Democrat National Newsletter to members citing PMP research findings, following a presentation by Webb to Liberal Democrat headquarters staff on 20 March 2019 \[S4.4\]. 

 Crucially, Labour peer Baroness Hayter pointed out the impact of PMP research on the party’s leadership contest in 2020 \[S4.5\]: ‘The New year poll of Labour members showing Keir Starmer as first choice for Leader did two things. It showed MPs making nominations that their first choice resounded with members. And it completely energised Starmer’s potential supporters who realised they could win, and that the hard work to come was likely to pay off. A pivotal point in the subsequent election.’ As noted above, the effects of these findings were also reflected in the betting market \[S7\]. 

 A presentation made by Webb to Green Party staff in January 2018 led directly to the party commissioning Webb and Bale to undertake further research on political strategy \(the confidential *Issue saliency analysis report for Green Party of England & Wales*\), which Webb summarised and presented at the party conference in October 2018. Nick Martin, former CEO of the Green Party, has confirmed its impact \[S4.6\]: ‘your report helped me and others hold the line strategically against those who wanted some sort of appeal to the whole electorate on a more narrow environmentalist pitch. Your analysis helped maintain an evidence base to what the Party was doing and helped retain a focus on available or potentially available electors.’ The Greens’ former Policy & Governance Manager, Matthew Browne, confirmed that the report ‘informed the Green Party’s political positioning, being used as evidence to inform Political Strategy Reviews held in January and August 2019. The report has also been used by the General Election Preparation Group, to guide Green Party Manifesto drafting and messaging…’ \[S4.7\]. One of the key messages of the report was that the party needed to emphasize Green housing and transport issues. As Nick Martin says in his email, ‘I think that the work you and Tim did for the party was influential in various choices, e.g. I think you will see quite a lot of coverage of housing in the party's programme and/or manifesto.’ \[S4.6\]. Housing was subsequently the second section of the 2019 manifesto \(after a green new deal for energy\), followed by transport \(another issue emphasized in the report\) \[S5\]. All party proposals on these subjects were in line with PMP recommendations. 

 PMP’s written submission to the Chakrabarti Inquiry on anti\-Semitism in the Labour Party used the 2016 PMP survey of Labour members to show the extent to which anti\-Semitism was regarded as a problem in the Labour Party by its own grassroots, and how such views tended to split along factional lines \(with supporters of Jeremy Corbyn far less inclined to believe the party had an anti\-Semitism problem than his internal opponents\). Subsequently, the House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs Report into anti\-Semitism in the UK cited PMP research on the attitudes of party members several times \[S6\]. In particular, the Report is critical of the Chakrabarti Inquiry’s conduct and conclusions, largely because of a sense of complacency regarding the extent of the problem. PMP research was one of the evidential sources on which the Select Committee drew \[S6, p.40\]. 

 In May 2019, as a direct result of PMP research, PMP advised MPs Stella Creasy & Lisa Nandy about the demographic profile of a proposed Citizens’ Assembly of Labour members on Brexit. Creasy said: ‘just want to say thank you so much for your help with our together against Brexit stuff \- it definitely shifted things in Labour’ \[S4.8\]. 

 Finally, the Head of General & Social Statistics at the House of Commons Library has confirmed the usefulness of PMP data for the Library’s work in briefing MPs, the media and external users, citing it as being ‘routinely in our “top 10” downloaded briefings on social statistics – typically it is downloaded around 400 times a week’ \[S4.9\]. In particular, PMP research informed a House of Commons Research Briefing on party members \(9 August 2019\).

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Two large scale research projects funded by The European Commission H2020, and led by Woods, addressed high priority environmental challenges in Europe. A rigorous co\-creation process established the value of a novel environmental monitoring framework. Bespoke methods, tools and resources were developed and validated with stakeholders including citizens, scientists, NGOs, the open\-source community, and industry and policy\-makers in more than 200 individual events and workshops between November 2015 and November 2020. 

 **Making Sense \(MS**\) addressed issues of chronic pollution using open design for hardware, software, data and methods through the delivery of citizen science campaigns in Amsterdam, Barcelona and Pristina from 2015 – 2018. **MS** emphasised co\-creation as a methodology through an eight\-step process to support change\-practices **\[R1\]**. The research revealed how communities with access and ownership of their environmental data could monitor change, analyse data, find relevance and achieve impact over time. A novel design tool, Community Level Indicators \(CLIs\), was created to address a gap enabling communities to generate and communicate findings, as well as formulate, track and evaluate the emergence of change longitudinally **\[R2\]**. ‘ *Citizen Sensing: A Toolkit*’ brought together the full scope of research from model and co\-creation methods, selected case studies, metrics, insights and testimonials from participants **\[R3\]**. 

 Whilst **MS** focused on international urban cities, spanning 3 separate countries, **The GROW Observatory** **\(GROW\)** subsequently extended this reach to engage 24 rural communities in 13 EU member states over a 3\-year period \(2016 – 2019\). **GROW** focused on a single issue, continuous monitoring of soil moisture, for sustainable food growing and climate change with people managing the land and soil.  The deployment of 15,000 low cost Internet of Things sensors achieved scale and created a high quality in\-situ dataset to meet the objectives of space science and earth observation **\[R4\]** and impact for society. GROW created decision\-support information for citizens and scientists, which alongside citizens’ uptake of open datasets resulted in changes in practice e.g. land and soil management, and water savings. The participant evaluation highlighted inclusion, empowerment and reward; education and peer\-to\-peer learning through MOOC’s \(17k\+ active learners\); the alignment of local environmental ‘matters of concern’ to global issues; and community resilience as vital to our framework. The research demonstrated an evidence\-based strategy for storytelling to engage 7M people across the GROW website, @growobservatory social media channels, film, television, radio and webinar broadcasts. The action\-orientated participatory methods and service design tools supported change and advocacy with policymakers, and found that contrary to the literature, models of participation are not static **\[R5\]**. 

 The research evidenced, for the first time, that remotely sensed soil moisture e.g. satellite\-derived products, can be validated using crowdsourced in\-situ soil moisture measurements to improve the accuracy of predictions for extreme climate events **\[R6\]**. The research has advanced the implementation of UN SDGs and targets through awareness, training, participatory methods and multi\-stakeholder connections; citizen\-generated datasets have provided sustained data collection to contribute to indicator level monitoring **\[R7\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has led to a diverse range of changes in practice; changes in understanding of data; increased and widened participation in both research, scientific practice and innovation; in willingness and confidence to engage; and in informing and changing policy at local and national levels. 

 **Community and social empowerment driving environmental change** 

 People were engaged in **MS** action\-orientated citizen science campaigns to gather environmental data, e.g. air quality, noise pollution and gamma radiation, to tackle failures in the reduction of urban pollution targets by municipalities. As a result, in Pristina, Kosovo, air quality data mobilised citizens to protest for the first time. **MS** framed this narrative, presenting accessible scientific research, and consequently captured headlines of major media outlet ‘Prishtina Insight’. In response the government enacted emergency measures, banning city centre transport over the course of 2 days for the first time **\[E3\]**. Meanwhile, in Plaça Del Sol, Barcelona, 40 active residents took up our resources and collected data which demonstrated that WHO noise limits were exceeded on a recurrent basis, deeply affecting their lives **\[E4\]**. The noise pollution was complex, related to late night public gatherings and drinking, and exacerbated by architecture, urban planning, local policy, social behaviour, urban health, and economics. Armed with their **MS** data, citizens combined lobbying of policy makers in the municipality with an awareness campaign highlighting the noise pollution, resulting in changes to public services such as night cleaning in the square and the refurbishment of municipal spaces to deter revellers; evidence from citizens is highlighted in a documentary **\[E5\]**. 

 **Changes in policy as direct result of citizen data** 

 Citizens often cite policy as an area in which they feel they have little agency, however our activity created opportunities to address this. The cumulative results of citizen sensing campaigns, including evidence and data given by **MS NGO** to an EU convention, resulted in change to the Constitution in Kosovo. In 2018 the Kosovo Assembly convened and passed the motion to amend citizens’ right to clean air through 17 recommendations **\[E6\]**. ‘Citizen Science Revolution’ documentary \(2018\) reveals this impact, featuring citizens and investigator statements. The documentary had 37,000 views as a live broadcast and 2,150 views between 7 December 2018 and 31 December 2020 on YouTube **\[E5\]**. Policy experts have recognized the importance of citizen science and engagement in **GROW** **\[E7\]**; in 2019 Woods was invited by the European Commission Directorate General Environment to provide expertise on new ‘Guidelines on Citizen Science for Environmental Monitoring’, to promote citizen science for environmental policy development and implementation **\[E8\]**. 

 **Changes in understanding and practice with respect to soil management.** 

 An independent EC assessment to validate project impact and best practice was undertaken as a part of the Knowledge Valorisation Policy; subsequently, GROW was highlighted in ‘Making Research Results Work for Society – Engaging Citizens to Accelerate Use of Research Results to Benefit All’ **\[E11\]**. Interviews with participants were conducted, and confirmed impacts included: In *El Hierro*, Canary Islands, farmers reduced water irrigation of crops by between ‘30 \- 50%’; **GROW** Greece integrated soil moisture with GIS data to monitor flooding and migratory birds in a wetland \(Evros Delta\); Walt, a **GROW** participant in Portugal, built his own data dashboard to monitor the threat of desertification and wildfires. 

 **GROW** Soil Moisture Datasets have been accepted in the International Soil Moisture Network, a repository with 3,200 registered users to date, and released as open data with licence for innovation. The dataset is used for satellite validation, model development and validation, meteorological applications, drought monitoring and other applications \(e.g. quality control\). GROW’s impact regarding the validation of satellite products, making accurate modelling of extreme climate events possible, was recognised at the European Commission Group Earth Observations \(GEO\), a partnership of 132 governments and organisations, promoting Earth observations for a sustainable planet. The Principal at GEO, stated: 

 *GROW Observatory … is the first operational, continental\-scale Citizens’ Observatory … for the first time, crowdsourced data has been used to validate 4 satellite soil moisture products, and 10\+ different satellite products can use this dataset…GROW brings GEO into the mainstream … It supports GEO priorities towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and addresses SDG2, SDG13 and SDG15*. **\[E10\]** 

 **Shaping Tools and data for environmental monitoring activities across the EU** 

 Our online education programmes on the Futurelearn platform \(MOOCS\) have delivered 27 weeks of education, providing rigorous training to more than 25,000 people from 182 countries around the world, to ensure data quality, and impart our framework and methods for the replication of Citizen Observatories. Between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2020\), our book *Citizen Sensing: A Toolkit* has distributed 3,000 hardcopies, and is a licensed CC\-BY\-SA pdf resource; download data is modestly estimated at 2,400\+ \(UoD Discovery, 8\+ additional websites\) setting the benchmark to meet local and global environmental goals. Between October 2020 and 31 December 2020, **GROW** has licensed tools and data for reuse \(downloaded 700\+ times\) **\[E1\]**. A range of NGOs, Governments, Institutes and Academia have adopted the approach including: Amsterdam Institute of Metropolitan Solutions, Lung Foundation, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute, Knowle West Media Centre, 300.000Km/s, National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo, U.S. Embassy in Kosovo and The Observatory for Public Sector Innovation **\[E5\]**. 

 Impact has also been recognised by independent juries through the following awards to the Grow Observatory: Honorary mention **ST\+ARTS prize**, ARS Electronica \(2018\) **\[E2\]**; **Soil and Land Management Award** \(2018\-19\), European Landowners’ Organization; **PIEoneer Awards Digital Innovation of the Year – Learning** \(2020\) **\[E9\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Professor Emma Marsden has made a substantial contribution to the widespread adoption of evidence\-informed best practice in the teaching of Modern Foreign Languages \(MFL\) worldwide, and has helped to set a national standard for the way in which pupils are examined and teachers are assessed throughout England. Marsden’s research was central to the 2016 MFL Pedagogy Review, which recommended radical changes of government policy and teaching practice. This led directly to the establishment, by the Department for Education \(DfE\), of a GBP3,630,000 National Centre for Excellence for Language Pedagogy \(NCELP\) to implement these recommendations – and the appointment of Marsden to lead it. To date, NCELP has held 225 professional training events, reaching approximately 760 MFL teachers across more than 170 schools in England. Marsden’s research has also informed a national review of GCSE subject content and the creation of a new MFL inspection framework for Ofsted. In response to COVID\-19, NCELP provided over 312 evidence\-based MFL lessons \(via a collaboration between NCELP and the Oak National Academy\) that were accessed and completed more than 30,000 times by KS3 and KS4 pupils in 2020. In tandem with these activities, Marsden has created freely accessible Open Science resources that have been downloaded more than 100,000 times, primarily by MFL teachers from around the world. She has also successfully incorporated them into the dissemination practices of 38 international academic journals.

##  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Marsden came to the University of York in 2004 after conducting doctoral and post\-doctoral research into grammar learning and testing of knowledge for MFL. Since then her research \(funded by organisations including the British Academy, ESRC and EPSRC\) has challenged the idea that pupils studying MFL, with very limited exposure to the language as is typically the case in England’s classrooms, can efficiently learn grammar indirectly or by rote\-phrase learning – a notion that has underpinned teaching methods and assessment practices for the last 30 years. 

 Marsden’s research – which has involved a range of languages and language features – shows clearly that students learn better with direct, sequential instruction **\[A\]\[E\]**. In particular, her research demonstrates the importance to learners of: 

-  focusing explicitly on the meaning and function of grammar in the input **\[A\]\[D\]\[E\]** 

-  brief but explicit grammar information prior to practice **\[A\]\[D\]\[E\]** 

-  being taught a verb vocabulary **\[B\]** 

-  grammatical understanding in their first language **\[E\]** 

 It became clear to Marsden that major barriers existed to teachers and policy\-makers being able to access and understand research\-based evidence, in order to inform and enhance their practice. Through further research, Marsden and colleagues were able to show that UK MFL teachers need and want their practice to be informed by research, but: 

-  often cannot access evidence because it is stored behind a paywall 

-  struggle to understand the evidence that is available 

-  do not have access to the validated instruments and tools that could help them apply research findings to their own practice **\[C\]\[F\]** 

 Marsden and colleagues have shown that this lack of transparency has serious negative effects on the rigour, quality, and replicability of research in language learning **\[F\]**. This in turn undermines the confidence with which research is communicated to, and applied by, practitioners and policy\-makers.

##  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on accessibility of published research** 

 Professor Marsden’s research has been key to fundamental changes in the working practices of international peer\-reviewed journals – persuading them to take part in two Open Science initiatives of her own creation: 

-  *IRIS \(Instruments for Research into Second Languages\):* a collection of instruments, materials, stimuli and data coding and analysis tools for research into second languages – all freely available to anyone in the world \(5,061 materials held and 49,691 downloads by December 2020  [<ins>https://www.iris\-database.org/</ins>](https://www.iris-database.org/)\). 

-  *OASIS \(Open Accessible Summaries in Language Studies\):* a free, searchable collection of language learning research findings, offering practitioners non\-technical one\-page summaries of published papers – explaining the aims of the research, the methods used, and the results found \(627 summaries currently held; live since January 2018;17,333 downloads by December 2020  [<ins>https://oasis\-database.org/</ins>](https://oasis-database.org/)\). 

 The Editor of the Modern Language Journal \(MLJ\) explains how these changes came about and why they are significant: *“Emma and her colleague \(Kasprowicz\) published a study providing powerful and sobering evidence about the extent and nature of the lack of engagement with research among language educators... Driven by her findings, Emma gathered together approximately 16 editors of key academic journals at a conference in 2017. There and in the following few months she led the development of a new genre – the Accessible Summary – and proposed mechanisms by which journals across the field might work together and contribute such summaries to the same freely accessible digital resource \[OASIS\], working across publisher boundaries.* 

 *Now, the MLJ requires every author to write a one\-page non\-technical summary of their study, following the OASIS guidelines. These summaries are all sent to the OASIS website and made openly and freely accessible. They are also each posted online on our own journal website … The impact this change has had on the publication process and dissemination of academic research is unprecedented, extensive, and highly significant. Previously, only those with \(access to\) subscriptions to the journal could read about research relating to the learning and teaching of foreign languages. Now these findings are available to all … Emma’s work on the benefits of open science was influential in persuading us to introduce this new policy”* **\[1a\]**. 

 OASIS currently holds 62 summaries of research published in the MLJ, and MLJ’s authors have 248 resources held on IRIS. The MLJ is one of 38 journals that now ask authors to make materials available through IRIS, and one of 16 of the 25 most highly cited and respected MFL journals to ask authors to write summaries for OASIS. This includes journals published by all the major publishing houses: Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, Springer, Routledge and Wiley. 

 These constitute fundamental but sustainable \(journal\-driven\) changes in the relationship between academics, publishers and practitioners, opening up a pipeline to convert research into everyday evidence\-informed language education around the world. According to the President of the Center for Applied Linguistics \(USA\), *“previous attempts to communicate academic research to practitioners have been ad\-hoc and short\-lived”* **\[2\]** but, in the words of the Editor of *Language Learning*, Marsden’s creation of a sustainable new approach is “ *truly transforming the game of research in our field”  \[1b\]**. 

###  Impact on government policy 

 In recognition of her research and her success \(via IRIS and OASIS\) in establishing a robust new relationship between research and practice, Professor Marsden was invited by the Teaching Schools Council to be a key advisor on its MFL Pedagogy Review \(2016; known as the ‘Bauckham Review’\). The Chair of that review says of Marsden’s contribution: *“Studies conducted by Emma and her colleagues formed a key part of the evidence base for the report’s recommendations”* **\[3\]** *.* 

 Launched at the British Council and the House of Lords in November 2016, the report **\[4\]** highlighted the misalignment between the research and practice of effective MFL teaching. It was formally welcomed in the House of Lords where the Parliamentary Under\-Secretary of State for Education urged schools to consider its recommendations \(Hansard, 7th December 2016\) **\[5a\]**, and by the Schools Standards Minister **\[5b\]**. In the spring of 2017, the DfE arranged for a MFL Mobilisation Group to consider strategies for acting on the report’s conclusions. This led to a proposal by the Schools Standards Minister to establish a National Centre for Excellence for Language Pedagogy \(NCELP\) – with an explicit remit to ensure that *“the principles and recommendations of the Bauckham Review will be followed so as to improve language teaching practice in secondary schools”* **\[6\]**. 

 The findings of the report – and the resulting plan to establish NCELP – were also cited in a report on improving social mobility through education presented to Parliament in December 2017 by the Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities. It states: *“We will make it our mission to improve access to high quality modern foreign languages subject teaching, particularly for disadvantaged pupils, drawing on the findings of the Teaching Schools Council review”* **\[7\]**. Deputy Director of the DfE’s Curriculum Policy division commented: “ *The report has had significant influence on Department policy, Ofsted school inspection practice, the GCSE examination boards, Ofqual regulation practice, and the work of educationalists, education publishers and the MFL subject associations”* **\[8\]** *.* The Chair of the MFL Pedagogy Review writes: “ *The report has changed, and will continue to change, the behaviour and thinking of policy\-makers, text\-book writers, the school inspectorate, GCSE examination boards, Ofqual, teacher educators, and classroom practitioners* **\[3\]** *.* 

###  Impact on execution of policy 

 Drawing on her key contribution to the MFL Pedagogy Review, Professor Marsden made a successful application to set up and direct NCELP at the University of York. Since its launch in December 2018, and now with a core team of fourteen researchers, CPD providers and resource creators, NCELP has established its reach across England, delivering courses and materials to eighteen specialist teachers in nine Lead Schools from Gateshead to Exeter. Each of these nine schools cascades the NCELP training and resources to four Hub Schools \(to date, a total of 308 teachers across all Lead and Hub Schools\) and other local schools \(a further 456 teachers\) to drive a nationwide improvement in the understanding and delivery of research\-informed pedagogy and curriculum design. 

 Over 225 NCELP professional development events have taken place to date, reaching more than 760 teachers, and a further 5,600 language professionals and learners have attended presentations by NCELP at external events. Of the teachers at NCELP’s 45 Lead and Hub schools, 92% say they are confident or very confident that they can deliver the recommendations of the MFL Pedagogy Review, and 92% also report that NCELP resources are helpful in supporting their teaching, one participant noting that: *“We feel re\-energised. I have had the most successful Year 7 lessons ever \(in my whole career\)”* **\[9\]**. 

 Chair of the MFL Pedagogy Review \(also CEO of a Multi\-Academy Trust, former President of the Association of School and College Leaders; Chair of the Project Board of Oak National Academy and Interim Chair of the Ofqual Board\) writes that NCELP *“has had a huge direct impact… Schools and teachers all over the country are using the freely available schemes of work and materials being produced by NCELP, in three languages \(French, Spanish, and German\). Via resources and an intensive programme of CPD \(full resources for which are also freely available\), the key changes in practice include: a sequenced progression of grammar including carefully revisited opportunities to practise; teaching grammar in the input via reading and listening; prioritising high frequency words and regular re\-visiting of those words; a de\-emphasis on teaching unanalysed chunks; an emphasis on raising awareness about L1\-L2 differences; the use of information\-gap activities that elicit the use of a grammar feature, making it essential and meaningful”* **\[3\]**. 

 NCELP has also allowed Marsden to build upon the impact of her previous open science initiatives by providing a searchable Resource Portal that links to both IRIS and OASIS. This database \( [<ins>resources.ncelp.org</ins>](https://resources.ncelp.org/)\) now holds 329 classroom\-ready lessons, 27 tests and 21 standalone professional development sessions developed by NCELP in line with the MFL Pedagogy Review. Many link to the OASIS summaries that informed their development which, in turn, often link to the original research materials on IRIS. To date, Resource Portal materials have been downloaded more than 100,000 times, approximately 75% of which has been by language teachers, instructors, and teacher educators. 

###  Impact on national assessment and school inspection 

 As part of its work NCELP has demonstrated that many of the words tested in the national GCSEs are very low frequency, that the exams overly reward rote\-learning, and that teaching is heavily influenced by these factors. Partly drawing on these findings, the DfE established a panel to review the subject content of the GCSE examinations \(affecting \~271,000 pupils each year\), and Marsden has been one of its key advisers. The Panel Chair writes: *“Emma has played a pivotal role”* **\[3\]** and the Deputy Director of the Curriculum Policy Division says: “ *Her input into the work of the group has been substantial, not least in recommending significant reform of how vocabulary should be treated in the new GCSE … As with the pedagogy review, Prof Marsden’s forensic knowledge of the research provided the panel with a better understanding about the nature of word frequency, word list compilation, and testing vocabulary, grammar knowledge, spoken production, and sound\-writing \(literacy\) knowledge”* **\[8\]** *.* 

 Professor Marsden has also contributed significantly to the creation by Ofsted of a new subject\-specific inspection framework for MFL, providing evidence about characteristics of effective pedagogy, the types of evidence that Ofsted might gather, and the research that can help teachers to conceptualise and observe MFL learning and knowledge. By helping Ofsted to align its inspection process with the recommendations of the MFL Pedagogy Review, Professor Marsden has therefore had a direct impact on the assessment and working practices of all MFL teachers in England **\[3\]\[8\]**. 

###  Impact on national education during the COVID\-19 pandemic 

 As director of NCELP, Professor Marsden co\-facilitated a collaboration with the Oak National Academy, which was established to deliver online teaching during the COVID\-19 lockdown. The Chair of Oak’s Project Board says: *“NCELP pedagogy principles and resources were used by NCELP network teachers to film over 240 fully resourced and ready\-to\-use lessons, across French, Spanish, and German, for years 7 and 8. The filming of 200 more is ongoing \(for the remainder of year 8 and for year 9\)”* **\[3\]**. To date, the NCELP network has delivered 312 video lessons, which have been accessed and completed 30,699 times. The collaboration has therefore seen the impact of Professor Marsden’s work find a much larger national and international teacher and pupil audience. 

###  Impact on provision of evidence\-based teaching resources via BBC Bitesize 

 In September 2019, Professor Marsden conducted a workshop for the BBC Bitesize development team. An Editor of BBC Bitesize writes: *“\[Emma\] described some of the research underpinning ... the MFL Pedagogy Review, illustrated how the recommendations in the review can be operationalised in learning materials, and she exemplified some of the schemes of work \(curricula\) that NCELP were developing that identify grammar to be taught and suggest sequences of learning.”* Drawing on this *“clear, well\-evidenced framework for meaningful and accessible language learning”*, the BBC team invested over GBP100,000 to produce new programmes of KS3 study in French, German and Spanish, a practice game for KS3 learners in each language, and BBC Teach videos exploring the teaching methods used in NCELP hub schools **\[10\]**. Equivalent programmes for KS2 learners in French, Spanish and Mandarin were launched in October 2020. \(BBC Bitesize reached 73% of secondary school pupils in the year ending March 2020, with a considerable rise during the COVID lockdown, reaching an average of just under 4,000,000 unique users per week in Summer 2020\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Asthana and Gibson has challenged longstanding and taken\-for\-granted assumptions around health funding which has resulted in a major redistribution of NHS funding. They found that coastal and rural areas received less funding \(per capita\) for health and local government services. Yet, because they have older populations and have experienced recent economic and social decline, they are grappling with higher burdens of illness and disability. Through working with government, their research has influenced the formula used to allocate 78 billion GBP annually to Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\) since April 2019, been the basis for the commissioned new English Children’s Social Services Funding Formula \(10 billion GBP annually\) and is being used by the Chief Medical Officer in understanding and developing public health strategies.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research programme, led by University of Plymouth, dates from 2000 to the present and rests on a philosophical critique of the mainstream approach to formula funding \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\], as well as methodological and technical innovation in the analysis and linkage of large data sets in order to refine resource allocation and increase the fairness of these models \[3.4, 3.5\]. Asthana and Gibson’s fundamental critique is that the econometric \(typically regression\) modelling which has been used to identify ‘needs’ variables from factors associated with historic service use in areas inevitably introduces circularity due to difficulties of adjusting for unmet need and/or unjustified supply. The methodological alternatives they have spearheaded include the analysis of large survey data to develop needs estimates that are not biased by historic use; the development of sophisticated microsimulation techniques that aggregate the range of factors associated with individual risk to the area level \[3.4\]; and the development of ‘person\-based’ as opposed to area\-based allocation models \[3.5\]. 

 Asthana and Gibson’s work had its origins in an ESRC\-funded project that developed practice\-level estimates of coronary heart disease in the UK and compared these estimates to activity data. It found that hospitalisation and surgical intervention rates were higher in urban practices and lower in rural areas than would be expected from practice\-level estimates \[3.6\]. The findings led the team to question the implicit assumption that, because urban deprived \(but young\) populations suffer profound health inequalities, they have greater needs for curative care. At the time, the possibility that demographically ageing rural and/or coastal areas might have a legitimate need for more resources was rarely given serious consideration. 

 With co\-applicants from the Universities of Exeter \(Professor Trevor Bailey\), Southampton \(Professor Graham Moon\), Edinburgh \(Professor Chris Dibben\) and Plymouth \(Dr Paul Hewson\), Asthana and Gibson have refined their approach to synthetic estimation \[3.4\]. Funded by NIHR, they produced a suite of cardiovascular \(n=24\) and mental health \(n=41\) estimates \( *the Plymouth Prevalence Estimates\)* at a range of spatial scales \(Lower\-Layer Super Output Areas \(LSOAs\), Middle Layer Super Output Areas \(MSOA\), general practice \(GP\), Primary Care Trust \(PCT\)/Clinical Commissioning Group \(CCG\), local authority \(LA\) \(2016\)\). They used these to explore equity of utilisation of cardiovascular care and mental health services in England. Key findings related to the importance of relative mix of care \(higher levels of presentation and primary management being associated with lower levels of hospital admission\); the persistence of ethnic variations after controlling for age and deprivation; and the role of systematic factors \(such as rurality/coastal deprivation\) in shaping patterns of utilisation. 

 One consistent finding of their research is that, because peripheral coastal and rural areas have been less deprived on average, they have received less funding \(per capita\) for health and local government services. Yet, because they have older populations and have experienced recent economic and social decline, they are grappling with higher crude burdens of illness and disability. This mismatch has led to inequalities in care and organisational stress \[3.6\]. At the same time, recent shifts in the distribution of children in poverty are driving higher service needs for younger, deprived people in the periphery. The multiple problems facing coastal communities have been difficult to analyse due to a lack of coastal definition and difficulties in linking data at different scales. As a short\-term solution \(and in response to a request from the Chief Medical Officer\), Asthana and Gibson developed algorithms to map, at LSOA level, disease prevalence and the distribution of key health risk factors.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 1976, health care equity has been an explicit goal of resource allocation within the NHS. However, a strong policy emphasis on the need to reduce both health inequalities and unmet need in deprived areas has resulted in the substantial redistribution of English NHS funding towards deprived areas. The underlying driver was that those areas suffering from urban deprivation were assumed to have a greater claim to NHS resources. However, the legitimate healthcare demands of, in particular, ageing populations in rural and coastal areas were not being given appropriate weight within the allocation formulae used to distribute NHS resources. Asthana and Gibson’s research identified this systematic bias in health funding and found that primary care trusts \(PCTs\) in rural areas are significantly more likely to be in deficit than their urban counterparts. This work has been instrumental in shifting the approaches taken to allocating funding to English public services, including 78 billion GBP annually through the NHS to Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\). It has been the basis for the commissioned new English Children’s Social Services Funding Formula \(10 Billion GBP annually\) and is being used by the Chief Medical Officer in understanding and developing public health strategies. 

 **Shaping the NHS approach and formulae for allocating 78 billion GBP of funding** 

 Asthana and Gibson’s research findings have resulted in a profound redistribution of NHS funding. As a member of the Technical Advisory Group \(TAG\) of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation \(ACRA\) from 2014\-2017, of ACRA itself from 2017 to present, and of NHS England’s Task and Finish group on Health Inequalities \(from 2020\), Asthana was instrumental in ACRA gaining a greater conceptual understanding of the conflicts between health care and health inequalities. Chris Bentley, Chair of TAG said; *“your research…has been hugely valuable in raising my own and the Committee’s awareness of shifting patterns of deprivation and morbidity from inner cities to the periphery and the extent to which coastal areas appear to be particularly affected with respect to higher disease prevalence…and poor health outcomes for children and young people.”* \[5.1\] 

 ACRA is the independent, expert body that makes recommendations on the geographical distribution of over 100 billion GBP \(per annum\) of funding for health services in England to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Chief Executive of NHS England. Through her membership of TAG and ACRA, Asthana has also been instrumental in establishing new approaches to funding allocations within the NHS. She contributed a conceptual understanding of the distinction between health inequality and unmet need and its analysis. For example, in 2017, the *Plymouth Prevalence Estimates* \(as outlined in section 2, above\) were selected by NHS England Analytical Services for a two\-year internal programme of work to model unmet need because the committee found them to be the most sophisticated and representative estimates available. Through using the *Plymouth Prevalence Estimates*, the NHS were able to develop alternative methodological approaches and new insights \[5.1\]. “ *\[Asthana and Gibson’s\] research has been invaluable in raising Government Department’s understanding of the limitations of utilisation\-based funding models and of evidence that rural and peripheral areas have been systematically under\-funded relative to underlying need…. there has been a shift in the response to the situation from local authorities… your body of research has played a critical role here.”* Jenny Owens, Lead Statistician, Society of County Treasurers \[5.2\]. 

 Subsequently, through her role on ACRA, Asthana has a direct impact on the financial allocations to CCGs nationally. Asthana challenged the way that the relationship between age and deprivation and the need for community services was represented in the general hospital and community services formula. This directly led to ACRA changing the formula used to calculate allocations to CCGs throughout England and altered how funding was distributed around the country. These changes were implemented in April 2019.  “ *\[Asthana\] provided critical and constructive challenge to the work of NHS England on the overall methodological approach to allocations…\[this\] resulted in significant changes to allocations to some coastal and rural areas, within the overall core allocation of £78 billion to CCGs”* Anna Everton, NHS England \[5.3\]. 

 **Creating a new English Children’s Social Services Funding Formula** 

 Funded by the Department of Education and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\), Gibson has been the technical lead on the development of a new Children’s Social Services formula. Drawing on Asthana and Gibson’s research on how to identify and control for needs variables with historic data to avoid circularity, Gibson has introduced, for the first time in Local Government, a ‘person\-based’ approach to funding in this sector through the modelling of individual data \(3.5 million children aged 6\-17 in receipt of children’s services in 16,5050 LSOAs within 71 local authorities\). By linking these data to LSOA and LA characteristics, Gibson has been able to control for the impact of local policy and practice \(itself an outcome of differential funding\), which had been a real problem in previous area\-based formulae. His formulae have publicly been described by the MHCLG’s Deputy Director of Local Government Finance as “ *ground\-breaking”* \[5.4\]. Once implemented, this formula will inform the distribution of 10 billion GBP of public funding and, compared to the previous funding formula, focuses resources more strongly on highly deprived \(again including coastal\) areas. Gibson’s work has enabled the DfE to gain access to highly sensitive child level data sets that were key to the individual\-led approach. The formula is now being used to support an analytical programme of work within DfE to improve their understanding of the drivers of activity for children’s social care and the factors contributing to variation across local authorities to inform their policy making. *“Dr Gibson has worked with us and the MHCLG in advising how best to analyse these data to disaggregate ‘need’ from ‘service use’ and from local policy and practice. This has also led the Department to adopt this approach in our own internal analysis of need… Myself and the teams here appreciate the quality and impact Dr Gibson has had on our work in understanding better demand for services for some of the most vulnerable children and families as well as the instrumental role he has had in the development of a new children’s service RNF.”* Rachel Merritt, Department for Education \[5.5\]. 

 **Influencing the national policy mental map of service need** 

 There has been a longstanding tendency for mental maps to associate social disadvantage with inner city living. Many of the funding formulae for English public services have reflected these mental maps, perhaps forgetting that cities also historically received higher funding allocations and consequently that these were reflected in future allocations. Since the 2000s, Asthana and Gibson have been creating prevalence maps that suggest that the highest prevalence of, e.g., coronary heart disease, cancer and depression are in the most peripheral areas, demonstrating that the ‘levelling up’ agenda is not one of North\-South divide, but of peripherality \(e.g., with cities such as Sunderland suffering the same challenges as Plymouth\). 

 Asthana and Gibson have been working with policymakers at a national level to affect understanding around these issues of peripherality, and to shape policy making processes at a national level. For example, from September 2020, Gibson and Asthana have had regular meetings with both Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and his researcher \(Bethan Loveless\) to: \(a\) outline the factors contributing to poor coastal outcomes and the role of funding formulae in exacerbating variation, and \(b\) provide a range of LSOA level maps of disease prevalence and variations in health service use relative to need to demonstrate the strong peripheral pattern in needs variables. 

 Asthana has also provided written and oral evidence on mental health in rural and coastal areas to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(Rural Services\) Enquiry on Rural Health and Social Care \(2020\). Anne Marie Morris MP, Member of Parliament for Newton Abbot & Chair of the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Rural Health & Social Care testifies: *“Professor Asthana has provided evidence as part of the inquiry, sharing critical insight into the challenges facing the provision of mental health services in rural and coastal areas and the health inequalities that exist. The fantastic contribution shaped aspects of later inquiry sessions, enabling us to focus on specific areas of interest. The APPG’s work has been recognised by both the Secretary of State for Health and the Chief Medical Officer as contributing to an area that needs further consideration at Government level. This marks the work undertaken by Professor Asthana and her colleagues as extremely relevant to current and future policy decisions”* \[5.6\] *.*

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Until recently, religion has either been neglected, or viewed as the ultimate threat to security by foreign policy makers. Petito’s research on postsecularism has contributed to a change in the policy mind\-set and practices of the Italian, UK and other Western governments by questioning foreign policy makers’ secular blind spots and by developing action\-oriented proposals that enable policymakers to better integrate religion into foreign policy. In particular, Petito’s work on religious engagement has significantly impacted on Italian foreign policy strategic planning, while his innovative approach to Freedom of Religion or Belief \(FoRB\) promotion has influenced European governments, as well as international organisations such as the EU & OSCE \(Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe\), leading them to develop new initiatives. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Petito’s research on the role of religion in International Relations \(IR\) spans two decades. Initially leading the first ever research project on ‘Religion and IR Theory’ \(1999\-2004\), Petito has since contributed to setting up a new reflexive research agenda to challenge the secularist bias of International Relations and the predominant assumption that the politicisation of religion is always an inescapable threat to security and inimical to modernity. 

 Since joining Sussex, Petito has expanded this line of interpretation, by exploring the theoretical implications of the postsecular debate for thinking about IR. Challenging secularisation as the master narrative of modernity and highlighting the ‘secular’ as a site of exclusion, his work has advanced the postsecular as a normative plea for new models of global politics able to include religious views \[3.1\]. He has also demonstrated the need to develop a postsecular sensibility in understanding international politics and in shaping foreign policy by removing what the diplomatic community has been increasingly acknowledging as ‘secular blind spots’ and creating new forms of secular\-religious partnerships to respond to global challenges \[3.2\]. 

 Moving his research to more applied work, he has focused on two new policy areas of growing interest to the foreign policy community: 1\) religious engagement in foreign policy \- how governments can engage with religious leaders and communities abroad to promote different foreign policy objectives, from development and human rights to peace building \[3.3\] \[3.4\]; and 2\) the protection of Freedom of Religion or Belief \(FoRB\) through foreign policy \- how governments can respond to the global trend towards greater religious persecution and discrimination \[3.5\] \[3.6\]. Petito’s research has developed innovative frameworks and action\-oriented proposals to enable policymakers to better face the policy challenges above. 

 On religious engagement in foreign policy, two important contributions have been made as a result of this research. One is an innovative conception of religious engagement in foreign policy, which emphasizes the construction of a knowledge base for foreign policy generated through encounter and dialogue with religious communities and religious non\-state actors \[3.3\]. The other is an Italian model of religious engagement in foreign policy. This is based on the idea that Italy, as the country which hosts the Holy See, has a unique geo\-religious position as the hub of a global network of religious connections which it can use to develop a special model of religious engagement based on the unparalleled mass of Rome\-based religious non\-state actors as a forum of consultation and policy advice \[3.4\]. 

 On the protection of FoRB through foreign policy, there have been two important results of this research that together call for a change in the dominant approach by governments and international organisations in response to the global crisis of FoRB. The first identifies the need for FoRB\-promotion policies to emphasise bottom\-up developmental strategies by balancing high\-level declaratory statements and government\-to\-government diplomacy with engaging local stakeholders and developing activities in response to local concerns \[3.5\]. The second research insight taken up in policy here is the idea that religious actors should not only be seen by policy makers as the victims, or the perpetrators of FoRB violations, but as partners in building long\-term strategies to advance FoRB and to foster pluralism, social cohesion and sustainable peace. In particular, interreligious engagment through dialogue and collaboration can be a useful policy tool to advance FoRB and combat intolerance based on religion or belief \[3.6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Since 2013, Petito’s research has enabled Western policymakers to: 1\) integrate religious literacy and engagement in foreign policy, and 2\) design and implement innovative strategies to promote FoRB through foreign policy. These two areas of impact were respectively developed through two major programmes and platforms for engagement led by Petito: The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs \(MFA\) initiative on ‘Religions and International Relations’ \(2012\-2017\), institutionalised in 2018 as a programme based at the leading Italian think tank Institute for International Political Studies \(ISPI\); and the *FoRB & Foreign Policy Initiative* at the University of Sussex, started as a British Council/Luce Foundation funded project \(2014\-16\) with a transatlantic focus, and officially launched in 2017 as a research and policy programme partnered with the FCO, the UK Parliament, the EU and Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe \(OSCE\)/Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights \(ODIHR\). 

 **Influence on attitudes and religious engagement capacity of Italian MFA \(and beyond\)** 

 In his testimonial, \[text removed for publication\] states: “it is very clear that within the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs \[MFA\], Petito is regarded as the preeminent thought leader with respect to the question of how religion fits into contemporary Italian diplomacy. Through my frequent interactions \[text removed for publication\] with the \[text removed for publication\] \[Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\], I saw the very clear impact of Petito’s influence with respect to how Italy was approaching the challenge of integrating greater awareness and outreach capacity on religion into its day\-to\-day work. Indeed, it is not too much of an exaggeration to credit him as the person responsible for giving rise to and nurturing these impulses within the ministry” \[5.1\]. 

 Since 2012, when Petito was officially nominated as the lead scientific coordinator of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ \(MFA’s\) initiative on Religions and International Relations, he has partnered with its Policy Planning Unit in co\-designing a programme convening a yearly policy dialogue with policymakers and religious representatives, as well as other faith\-based actors and experts. Each year the meetings considered a different issue of the postsecular agenda \[3.1\] drawing on a concept paper researched and drafted by Petito in dialogue with the Policy Planning Unit: in 2013, state\-religions arrangements; in 2014, religious engagement; in 2015/16, the Middle Eastern crisis; in 2017, the refugee crisis; in 2018, sustainable peace; in 2019, interreligious engagement; in 2020, inclusive citizenship \(for example concept paper, see \[5.2\]\). 

 This work has raised awareness and improved the understanding of the global resurgence of religion and the postsecular predicament \[3.2\] in the Italian foreign policy\-making community. The current \[text removed for publication\] states in his testimonial that “Petito has contributed many valuable insights and lines of interpretation, which have been tested through yearly events and a number of documents, and have then been translated into valuable policy recommendations”; and he concludes that “the initiative has had a remarkable impact on the analysis and considerations of the Policy Planning of the Ministry… as a consequence of these activities, the religious factor has progressively been embedded in the internal discussions of the Ministry and the opportunity to more intensively engage with religious actors is meeting increasing consensus among Italian foreign policy practitioners” \[5.3\]. The research has been used to design “a specific policy and action\-oriented approach… thus contributing to more nuanced and effective policy\-making” \[5.3\]. 

 Petito’s research has also influenced the conceptual frameworks and practical tools mobilised by Italian diplomats. In his testimonial, \[text removed for publication\] referred to Petito’s postsecular framework \[3.2\] as “an invaluable tool in the exercise of my diplomatic functions and an added value in my official and informal contacts, in a country where violent religious extremism hit tragically during the ’90s”; he has also confirmed that “Petito’s research influenced in a decisive manner my way of thinking about my diplomatic functions. In particular, l owe him the concept of religious engagement \[3.3\], a new idea on how diplomatic agents should relate to religious actors in order to bring about justice and stability in a troubled world” \[5.4\]. 

 The new model of religious engagement developed by Petito in the context of this Italian initiative \(outlined in an internal concept paper \[5.2\], later expanded and published as \[3.3\] & \[3.4\]\) has generated impact beyond Italy. The proposal was welcomed with interest by the Holy See, which first replied through its semi\-official voice of *Civiltà Cattolica* – the only journal directly overseen and approved by the Secretariat of State of the Holy See – stating “this orientation is indicative of a new relationship between religion and states, which the Catholic Church appreciates” \[5.5\]. Petito subsequently accepted an invitation to attend a high level international conference in March 2016 with its top diplomat, the Secretary for the Relations with States, who in his remarks responded point\-by\-point to the proposals Petito had outlined in the framing document for the meeting \[5.6\]. The \[text removed for publication\], described the above conference “as a key milestone in the developing thinking of a number of foreign ministries \(including the Holy See\)” and went on to observe that “Petito’s research and publications during this period, alongside the conferences/events he organised, had significant impact on my and the FCO’s developing thinking in this area, and from my observation similarly on the work of other foreign ministries, in particular those of Italy, Germany, and the European Action Service \(EAS\)” \[5.7\]. 

 **Impact on FoRB\-promotion strategies of FCO, Western governments, OSCE & EU** 

 From 2014 onwards, Petito brought together policy makers and other stakeholders from North America and Europe to discuss how to strengthen transatlantic cooperation on FoRB\-promotion. Following two successful closed\-door dialogues at Wilton Park and Georgetown University, a Policy Brief \[5.8\] was launched at a policy dialogue at the House of Lords, which brought together numerous major international policy stakeholders. As a result, Petito was invited to be part of the newly established All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) IFoRB \(International FoRB\) academic advisory board, to input into the revision of the FoRB FCO toolkit and, more instrumentally, to co\-author a new major APPG report \[3.5\] aimed at raising the priority to protect FoRB internationally in UK Government policy, and arguing for new, bottom\-up developmental strategies. Launched in Parliament in October 2017, it has already resulted in revisions to UK Government policy, via their adoption of three of the report’s major recommendations: 

  1.  Requirements for all embassies to report on FoRB and use the new toolkit \[5.9\]. 

  1.  The inclusion of the promotion of FoRB in DFID’s strategic priorities. The 2018 UK Aid Connect call allocated £12m for a pilot programme to promote FoRB \[5.10\]. 

  1.  The appointment in July 2018 of the Prime Minister’s new Special Envoy on FoRB, FCO Minister, Lord Ahmad, whom to recognise Petito’s contribution gave his first speech setting the vision for his new role in a meeting in Parliament convened by Petito on 12 July 2018 \[5.11\]. 

 In a personal letter to Petito, the \[text removed for publication\] stated that “the report has been praised by Government Ministers and Parliamentarians and was referenced several times during the APPG Westminster Hall’s debate on International FoRB day. It was also profiled by 15 media organisations, including BBC Radio 4… After the report’s launch, the \[relevant\] FCO Ministers of State re\-issued the FCO toolkit on FoRB to all British embassies and high commissions… and asked them to report on what they are doing to advance FoRB.” \[5.9\] 

 In 2018 Petito led a year\-long major multi\-stakeholder consultation process under the patronage of the 2018 Italian OSCE \(Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe\) Chairmanship to co\-produce innovative knowledge on interreligious engagement as a policy tool to advance FoRB and combat intolerance based on religion or belief \[3.6\]. The key message of the final report of the consultation \(presented and discussed on 6 Dec 2018 at the 25<sup>th</sup> OSCE Ministerial Council in Milan\) was adopted, almost *verbatim*, as one of the points of the 2018 OSCE Chairmanship\-in\-Office Conclusions on FoRB, Tolerance and Non\-Discrimination. It offers “the warmest encouragement of initiatives to promote interreligious dialogue and partnerships, also through the inclusion and engagement of religious and belief communities in public discussions…as partners in building long term strategies to advance FoRB for all and foster pluralism, social cohesion and sustainable peace.” \[5.12\] 

 Three policy outcomes have emerged from the dissemination of this research \[3.6\]: 

  1.  The OSCE/ODIHR convened in Oct 2018 its Panel of FoRB Experts, regarded as one of the major international mechanisms focusing on FoRB together with the UN special rapporteur on FoRB, to draft guidelines on Interfaith and Interreligious Dialogue and Partnerships. In that context, Petito’s findings were presented to inform their work. Furthermore, in recognition of this work in June 2019 Petito was appointed for a 3\-year term as the UK representative to the 16\-member panel of FoRB experts selected from the 57 OSCE participant states and is currently a member of the working group writing the above guidelines. 

  1.  The model of interreligious engagement was endorsed by senior diplomats with relevant portfolios, such as the Advisor for Religious Affairs of the French MFA and the Finnish Ambassador\-at\-Large for Intercultural and Interreligious Dialogue Processes in a series of video\-interviews given at the recent meeting convened by the Italian MFA in partnership with the Transatlantic Policy Network on Religion and Diplomacy \[5.13\]. As a result, Petito was hired as a consultant \(2019\-20\) by the German Ministry for International Cooperation and Development \(BMZ\) to assist the German Commissioner for Global Freedom of Religion with the design of its first ever FoRB pilot programmes. Currently Petito has been developing in partnership with Wilton Park \(FCO\) and United States Agency for International Development \(US AID\) a follow\-up policy dialogue initiative on FoRB & the SDGs \(UN Sustainable Development Goals\) now rescheduled for early 2021 \[5.14\]. All initiatives delayed by COVID. 

  1.  Petito was invited by Jan Figel, the EU Special Envoy for the Promotion of FoRB outside the EU, to chair the final high\-profile stock\-taking event of his temporary mandate \(2016\-19\) \(Brussels, 19\-20 Oct 2019\) and to assist with the drafting of the related final report for the newly appointed president of the European Commission. The report \[5.15\] specifically endorses Petito’s ideas as the third of only five action\-oriented recommendations put forward and emphatically states its “support \[for\] the model of ‘interreligious engagement’ put forward by a recent report of the *FoRB & Foreign Policy Initiative* of the University of Sussex” \(p. 10\). On 9 July 2020 the EC announced the official renewal of the Special Envoy mandate.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Giovannetti’s research on competitors’ cooperation and networks has led to: 

-  The United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union \(ITU\) adopting new practices for collecting and analysing data on 125 countries’ cooperative platforms, and using this data to inform their global ICT policies and governance. 

-  A set of new policy recommendations, published by the ITU, on the impact of collaboration in innovation ecosystems detailing how best to bring connectivity to the 50% of the world population that has no internet access. 

-  A set of recommendations published by the UK’s Department of Business Innovation and Skills \(BIS\), for improving productivity. These were endorsed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \(OECD\). 

-  The drafting and adoption of the Digital Sector Strategy of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority \(CPCA\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Giovannetti’s research focuses on internet market power and the adoption of new technologies. Two sub\-themes of this research, conducted at Anglia Ruskin University since 2011, have focused on: 

1.  the innovation outcomes of cooperation between otherwise competing organizations \( **R1, R2**\), and 

1.  new indicators to assess the market power and success of organisations in the digital sector \( **R3\-6**\). 

 These areas of research are deeply interconnected. The internet and related information and communications technologies \(ICTs\) foster technological adoption and the diffusion of innovations, which are necessary for sustainable economic development, both locally and nationally. Both sub\-themes are discussed separately as they have led to distinct impact with global reach and significance \(Section 4\). 

 The first area of impact is underpinned by results obtained in **R1** and **R2**. These publications provide: 

-  an empirical analysis of the impact of cooperation in innovative activities on innovation rates and productivity \( **R1,** with Piga, Keele University\) 

-  a theoretical analysis of the incentives for market competitors in their adoption of new technologies \( **R2**\). 

 Empirical findings in **R1** stem from a research project led by Giovannetti \(PI\): “Investigating external and private benefits of investments in UK skills & training”. This research was funded by the UK Department for Business Innovation and Skills \(BIS\) \(BIS/RBU/025/2012 **; S1**\) to develop an econometric model using data from multiple UK Innovation Surveys. The analysis shows that collaboration in innovative activities among non\-competing organisations, including customers and suppliers, is an essential element for success. Having said that, the research did also show that inter\-competitor cooperation could also slow innovation, as competitors either agree to stall innovations or waste resources on duplicating innovation. Hence, regulatory authorities should seek to set incentives and policies that only support productive collaboration within innovation ecosystems. 

 These empirical results complement theoretical insights obtained in **R2,** which applies game theory to identify the incentives that lead to different levels of technological adoption among regional neighbouring market competitors. This framework shows that global adoption of a new technology does not emerge where there is strong market competition between firms, especially when there is a high level of market integration facilitated by ICTs. The disincentives to adopt innovations provoked by strong competition should be addressed when designing innovation and sector policies, which would facilitate greater levels of innovation diffusion and reduce the persistence of regional technological inequalities. 

 The second area of research, drawing from results analysing complex network features in underpinning publications **R3\-6**, has led to the development of novel empirical indicators for predicting crowdfunding success and in identifying market power within ICT platforms. These publications showed: 

  

-  The key role played by *network centrality* in capturing market power in Mobile Internet connectivity \( **R3**, with Sigloch, PhD student at ARU\) and within Internet exchange facilities \( **R4**, with D'Ignazio, Bank of Italy\) 

-  The positive impact on the success of digital crowdfunding platforms from investing in *digital* *social capital*, through reciprocal support and shared social networks amongst crowdfunding projects \( **R5**, with Davies, PhD student at ARU\) 

-  The positive impact of levels of *trust* on the technical stability of the global Internet, whereby trust is built by maintaining long\-lasting interconnections among Internet operators \( **R6**, with D'Ignazio, Bank of Italy\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Giovannetti’s research on the innovation outcomes of cooperation between competing organizations, and on indicators of market power and success of organisations in the digital sector have resulted in impact with global reach and significance across four main domains: 

###  Developing and facilitating global ICT policy 

 New data on the cooperative platforms of 125 countries were collected, analysed and used to inform global ICTs policies and governance by the UN’s International Telecommunication Union \(ITU\). Founded in 1865 to facilitate international connectivity in communications networks, the ITU is now the UN agency dedicated to ICTs. The ITU includes 193 Member States as well as some 900 companies, universities, and international and regional organizations. The ITU allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits, develops the technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect, and strives to improve access to ICTs for underserved communities worldwide under the UN mandate to ‘bridge the digital divide’. To this aim, the ITU works with public and private sector partners to ensure that ICT access and services are affordable, equitable and universal and are empowering people around the world through technology education and training. The ITU also regularly publishes the industry’s most comprehensive and reliable ICT international statistics. 

 Much of the work at ITU is done in study groups. The main output of a study group is the establishment of technical standards or guidelines and recommendations.  Giovannetti’s underpinning research \( **R1\-6**\) led to his election as Vice\-rapporteur of the ITU’s Telecommunication Development Sector’s \(ITU\-D\) *Study Group 1*. In this role, he revised the ITU *Annual Tariff Policies Survey,* proposing the inclusion of a set of new questions on countries’ modes of access to, and governance of, Internet Exchange Points \(IXPs\) and National Research and Education Networks \(NREs\). These were two further types of Digital Exchange Platforms used for enhancing cooperation among Internet Service Providers and Universities and research centres, that form an essential component of strategies aimed at lowering costs and increasing the affordability of internet access in developing countries **\(S3\)**. 

 The resulting datasets are now available on the ITU Statistics website, ICT\-Eye, and have been used in global and regional level forums, to discuss global trends in regulation for Sector Members and other national and international stakeholders. For the year 2019, more than 125 datapoints have been collected world\-wide, based on the member states’ answers to these new questions **\(S2\)** and this data is now referenced and used in ITU’s Study Group official reports informing and advising member states on best practice for lowering the costs of interconnection policies **\(S3\)**. Elaborations, visualisations and guidelines on interconnection through shared infrastructures such as IXPs and NREs, based on these new survey data, are included in the ITU\-D Study Group 1 Report on “Question 4/1: Economic policies and methods of determining the costs of services related to national telecommunication/ICT networks.” This report, co\-edited by Professor Giovannetti in his role as Vice\-Rapporteur of the ITU\-D Study Group1, referring to **\(R4\)** regarding the relevance of IXPs in lowering connectivity costs in developing countries, was submitted and approved as *ITU\-D Document 1/355\-E* **\(S3\)** during the 3<sup>rd</sup> Plenary meeting of Study Group 1 \(Geneva, 19 February 2020 \- attended by 182 delegates from 62 countries\) and is being translated into the six official UN languages for final publication, after being finalised at the Plenary Study Group 1, Rapporteurs virtual meeting, \(hosted in Geneva, 21 September 2020, *ITU\-D Document SG1RGQ/325* **\(S3\)**\). 

###  Improving global connectivity 

 Giovannetti’s research has led to a new set of policy recommendations published by the ITU. These have informed global public debates on the impact of collaboration in innovation ecosystems and how best to bring connectivity to the 50% of the world population without internet access **\(R1\-4\)**. 

 In 2016, Giovannetti was invited by the then ITU\-D Director, Mr Sanou **\(S4\)** to join the expert academic group and write a chapter \(“Digital Divide and Digital Multiplier: A Paradigm Shift through Innovation **” \(S4\)**\) for an ITU volume setting out a roadmap to achieve the ICT\-related targets of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\). The volume was launched at the Buenos Aires Ministerial Roundtable, held at the 2017 World Telecommunication Development Conference \(WTDC\-17\) on ""ICT for Sustainable Development Goals \(ICT4SDG\)"". This conference was attended by more than 1,360 participants, including 1,010 government delegates representing more than 130 countries **\(S4\).** Drawing on his underpinning research **\(R1\-4\)**, Giovannetti’s chapter **\(S4\)** provides a new set of policy recommendations for how best to support sustainable ICT\-centric innovation ecosystems. These recommendations were republished in the *ITU\-News* Magazine **\(S5\)**, emphasising their potential to inform policies for reducing the digital divide. In addition, the World Economic Forum published an article on the specific recommendations focussing on crowdfunding success titled “These are the things that successful crowdfunding projects do” **\(S6\)** based on Giovannetti and Davies’ underpinning research **\(R5\)**. 

 Evidence of the reach of this ITU published volume, that includes Giovannetti’s policy recommendations **\(S4\),** is provided by it being referenced in: 

-  Jordan’s ICT Sectorial Strategy \(Gedeon and Al\-Qasem, 2019\), prepared by The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit \(GIZ\) for the Jordanian Ministry of Industry, Trade and Supply 

-  the UNESCO Policy Paper \(2019\) “ICT for Sustainable Development. Recommendations for Public Policies that Guarantee Rights”. 

 As a follow\-up on the regulatory implications of Giovannetti’s underpinning research \( **R1\-6\),** he also co\-chaired the ITU\-D workshop on the “Economic Impact of the Over the Top applications \(OTT\)” \(Geneva September 2019\). This workshop led to a dedicated report published as official *ITU\-D Document 1/339\-E* \- “Economic impact of OTTs on national telecommunication/ ICT markets” **\(S3\).** This report, co\-edited by Giovannetti and formally adopted at the Plenary assembly on 22 February 2020 **\(S3\)** has been published by the ITU in the six official UN languages. The document draws together lessons learned from the research to inform the development of regulatory guidelines internationally. 

###  Improving UK productivity 

 Giovannetti’s research has led to a set of recommendations for the UK Department of Business Innovation and Skills \(BIS\), subsequently endorsed by the OECD, for improving UK productivity. 

 The results and policy recommendations explored in the BIS funded project were published in December 2014 as a *BIS Research paper n 203* **\(S1\)**. This examined innovation enablers, with a focus on targeted subsidies and incentives for R&D and training activities in key sectors. Giovannetti was involved, as Principal investigator, in the design of the project, and, according to Simon McKee of the BIS Skills and Policy Analysis unit, “Giovannetti worked closely with myself and other colleagues to define the scope of work, to ensure that it was useful from the perspective of government policymakers” \(BIS 2014 **, S1**\). 

 The report and its results filled an important gap in understanding and enabled new capabilities for modelling innovation data and their impact on productivity. This was shown by the highly influential “OECD UK Productivity Report” **\(S7\)** presenting a set of recommendations on how to improve UK productivity. This cited Giovannetti’s *BIS Research paper n 203* **\(S1\)** as one of only four publications considered **key** **references** underpinning their policy recommendations on UK productivity. The results of the BIS model showing the potential negative impact of cooperation in innovative activities among product competitors, were also presented at a dedicated meeting with the BIS Skills & Training team on 12 May 2014, and to the *UK Innovation Survey User Group* at BEIS on 20 March 2017. The findings were also discussed through ten separate one\-to\-one meetings between 2015 and 2017 held by Giovannetti with key policymakers, facilitated by Giovannetti’s participation in the University of Cambridge *Centre for Science and Policy’s* Policy Fellows Network **\(S8\).** 

###  Introducing local digital strategy 

 Giovannetti’s research has contributed to the writing and adoption of the 2019 Digital Sector Strategy \(DSS\) by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority \(CPCA\). 

 The DSS is a central component of the Local Industrial Strategy \(LIS\) adopted by the CPCA. The role of the DSS is to ensure that the area continues to be economically competitive through the success of the digital sector and through the adoption and diffusion of smart technologies. Giovannetti’s input was through two distinct leading roles: 

-  as a member of the Steering Commission for the DSS, and, 

-  as the academic lead for the Anglia Ruskin University and Cambridge Wireless strategy team that won the bid to write the DSS. 

 The DSS report is based on consultation with, and a survey of, multiple organisations and businesses involved in the Digital sector. The design of the consultation and survey were informed by Giovannetti’s previous research \( **R1, R4 and R5**\). The DSS **\(S9\)** recommendations were also directly informed by Giovannetti’s underpinning research; his previous research being explicitly cited in them. The DSS was adopted by the CPCA on 15 March 2019 and was then integrated into the wider CPCA LIS in September 2019 **\(S9\).** The importance of this work is emphasised by the Mayor of CPCA, James Palmer, who said that “The first Local Industrial Strategy for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough will help create the conditions to achieve our ambition of doubling economic output and ensuring future prosperity” **\(S10\).** 

 The report is directly shaping regional policy. Acting on the report’s recommendations, the CPCA is investing, through the programme CambWifi, in providing free public access Wifi in market towns across Huntingdonshire to help residents keep connected and bolster local businesses through the Covid pandemic. On 8 October 2020, CambWifi went live in St Neots, and is being extended to St Ives, Ramsey and Huntingdon town centres. The secure public access Wifi network is being rolled out as part of the Connecting Cambridgeshire programme through the collaboration and investment of local authorities, Cambridgeshire County Council with the support of Huntingdonshire District Council, and additional funding for market towns from Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Combined Authority. Welcoming the launch of free CambWifi, CPCA’s Mayor James Palmer said: “Public access Wifi has an important part to play in supporting struggling high streets and will help to bolster economic recovery from Covid\-19 by encouraging people to shop locally and to support local businesses. The Combined Authority is investing in digital connectivity for our market towns now and for the future.”

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Seasonal traditions and the gothic are two of the major ways we – as individuals and societies – connect to, imagine and contest the past. Groom’s research has deepened and shaped national debate around these key forms of intangible cultural heritage, and also led to an uptake in participation. In recontextualising seasonal traditions and the gothic by linking them with contemporary concerns, it has achieved the following impacts: 

-  **Enhancing awareness and understanding of intangible cultural heritage** through contributing to the Christmas advertising campaign of a major national supermarket. 

-  **Transformed the teaching of gothic literature** in schools across the UK and North America with new online educational resources. 

-  **Promoted public health initiatives** **through gothic** **literature**, improving awareness of blood disorders and encouraging blood donation. 

-  **Inspired exhibitions and performances** that innovatively reinterpret classic gothic texts for contemporary audiences, and renewed public debate around seasonal traditions and rural life.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Groom’s research on different aspects of intangible cultural heritage, is framed by an overarching aim to excavate its rich lives and contested histories and explore its reinvention in contemporary culture. Thus, his research on the gothic demonstrates the literary, social, and political shaping of its many manifestations, and is distinct in linking 18th and 19th\-century gothic novels to the vast cultural industry of contemporary gothic; similarly, his research on seasonal traditions investigates what they mean to contemporary societies living increasingly atomised and urban and with ever more unpredictable and extreme weather. 

 His extensive programme of research on the gothic emphasises its significance in politics, science, medicine, theology, philosophy, social sciences and debates about national identity – as well as in literature and architecture – and has challenged the popular myths that surround novels such as *Frankenstein* and *Dracula*. This breadth is reflected in Groom’s innovative study *The Gothic: A Very Short Introduction* \(OUP, 2012, **\[3.5\]**\), and in his production of four new editions of key gothic novels for Oxford University Press: Horace Walpole’s *The Castle of Otranto* \(2014\), Matthew Lewis’s *The Monk* \(2016\), Ann Radcliffe’s *The Italian* \(2017\), and Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein* \(2018\) \[ **3.6**\]. Groom’s expertise led to a commission from Yale University Press for *The* *Vampire: A New History* \(2018\), published to celebrate with the bicentenary of John Polidori's *The Vampyre* \[ **3.4**\]. This book presents a new understanding of the ways in which the vampire has been used since the Enlightenment as a ‘thought experiment’ to define the human in medicine and science, theology and philosophy, and politics and economics. It redefines the figure of the vampire away from popular perceptions of monstrous Eastern European bloodsuckers and/or undead aristocrats, and has led to collaboration with epidemiologists, patient groups and theatre makers, linking gothic literature to contemporary medical research on blood disorders and using it to promote public health initiatives. In 2019, he was part of the Doctor Dracula project, in collaboration with Dr Luke Pilling \(University of Exeter Medical School\), which received Wellcome Trust Public Engagement funding. 

 Groom has used a similar pioneering approach to seasonal traditions and cultural environmentalism. For millennia, the passing seasons and their rhythms have marked our progress throughout the year, and Groom’s research both celebrates and details the English seasons and their trove of folklore and festive customs. His research is notably distinct from how calendrical customs and festivities are usually researched by folklorists, cultural historians and contemporary almanacking in that he explains in detail the literary, social and political shaping of traditions around periods such as Christmas \[ **3.2**, **3.3**\]. He demonstrates the close historical interrelationships between what are today distinct seasonal customs, such as Hallowe’en and Valentine’s Day. *The Seasons: An Elegy for the Passing of the Year* \(2014\) argues that tradition and our links with nature still have a vital role to play in all our lives. \[ **3.1**\]. Its ground\-breaking significance was recognised in extensive reviews in the national media and in its shortlisting for the Katharine Briggs Folklore Prize 2014. It was runner\-up in the BBC Countryfile Book of the Year 2014 as well as being *Guardian* Book of the Week, *Reader’s Digest* Book of the Month and one of the *Observer’s* Books of the Year.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Enhancing awareness and understanding of intangible cultural heritage** 

 
Groom’s research has enhanced cultural understanding of Christmas traditions through, among other means, commercial consultation with a major supermarket chain. The collaboration with Morrisons – the UK’s fourth\-largest supermarket – enabled significant national reach in explaining and reviving neglected Christmas traditions. Groom was commissioned in 2017 to provide a unique context for their national Christmas marketing campaign, based on the custom of placing an orange in a Christmas stocking. He researched and wrote a 200\-word story for children on this forgotten seasonal tradition, which promotes charitable acts. This was given away – along with a free orange – to 200,000 customers, and the campaign reached 16 million people through print and broadcast media coverage while an accompanying video was viewed over 50,000 times. The PR agency responsible, The Academy, reported that it was one of Morrisons’ ‘big marketing tactics’ of 2017 – prompting them to repeat it in 2019. \[ **5.1**\] Feedback from parents praised the initiative as reconnecting families with seasonal traditions and educating children regarding its origins: ‘ *Christmas can be lost in material things and this story really brings it back to the real meaning and also educates them about some of the history behind* Christmas **.’\[5.1\]** 

 Groom has shaped and informed public attitudes to the gothic through the cumulative effect of new editions, public talks and appearances on broadcast media. This has enabled new understandings of how contemporary gothic is indebted to its long history. For the BBC, his work includes a programme on the history of vampires for Radio 3’s Art and Ideas \(October 2018\) and a commissioned podcast on ‘A brief \(and ghoulish\) history of vampires’ \(16,700 downloads October 2018\-December 2019\), while an interview on vampires was a Radio 4 ‘Best of Today’ and broadcast on the World Service \[ **5.2**\]. Through regular presentations and workshops, including at major literary festivals, participant feedback repeatedly highlighted how Groom had changed the way they understood the Gothic. \[ **5.3**\] The Jane Austen Society of North America chose *The Gothic: A Very Short Introduction* to be read and discussed by Groom with their online reading group \(5,000 members\). Society chairman Margarita Levin, described it as ‘expansive and informative’, adding: ‘Everyone came away with a greater understanding of how the \[Gothic\] has been used.’ \[ **5.4**\] 

 Groom’s new editions of gothic novels – *The Castle of Otranto*, *The Italian*, *The Monk* and *Frankenstein* – have been important in recontextualising and promoting discussion of the gothic. Cumulatively, they have sold 63,500 copies, including 35,500 of international sales **\[5.5**\]. The new edition of *Frankenstein* and Groom’s monograph *The Vampire* were released to celebrate the bicentenary of original publication, and were used as springboards to generate debate, reaching people who would not usually engage with gothic literature. For example, *Frankenstein* led to interviews \( *Observer*, *Times*\) and a feature in *The Sun* with the headline: “‘Flakensteins’: Snowflake students claim Frankenstein’s monster was ‘misunderstood’ – and is in fact a VICTIM\)’” which provoked national debate \(BBC, Guardian, Spectator, Radio 4, and many others\) and a public discourse on social media on its meaning for contemporary readers. \[ **5.6**\] 

 **Improving the teaching of gothic literature with new educational resources** 

 Groom has influenced the design and delivery of gothic literature in colleges and secondary schools through an extensively viewed online lecture series and in\-person masterclasses. The latter, on the continuing relevance of historical and contemporary contexts of politics and science in the gothic, have provided unique learning opportunities. A teacher testimonial from Langley School stated that *‘The idea of Frankenstein as a novel for the 21st century was one that the students had struggled to consider effectively beforehand, but afterwards they came away feeling that the text has much more social, political and personal relevance today.’* \[ **5.7**\] 

 Building on these face\-to\-face sessions, Groom developed online educational resources to stimulate and influence the teaching of gothic literature through partnership with MASSOLIT, an online teaching resource platform for UK and North American schools. He created a series of highly popular lecture series on key novels such as *Dracula*, *Frankenstein*, *Lord of the Flies*, *The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, *The Supernatural: A Complete History* and *The Picture of Dorian Gray*. Groom contributed 37 lectures in total, and these have been utilised by 350 schools, cumulatively receiving 222,622 international viewings and downloads from March 2017 to December 2019. Most of his lecture series are in the 30 most\-watched: 

 *‘\[Groom\] is the second or third most\-watched academic in the collection.’*– Chris Tudor, founder of MASSOLIT **\[5.8\]** 

 One teacher commented that his lectures ‘really improved the depth of my knowledge on the contextual influences and moved my thinking away from simpler stereotypes’. \[ **5.8**\] 

 **Promoting public health initiatives and raising awareness of blood disorders** 

 Groom’s research has raised awareness of blood disorders through an innovative performance which combined contemporary medicine and the early history of the vampire. In 2019, he was part of the Wellcome Trust\-funded ‘Doctor Dracula’, which combined his vampirology with Dr Luke Pilling’s research in haemochromatosis, a genetic condition caused by an overload of iron in the blood, to produce an immersive performance with theatre company Four of Swords. The production ran in Devon in February and March 2020, with 638 attendees \(further planned performances were cancelled due to Covid\-19\). 

 Representatives attended from Haemochromatosis UK and the ‘Exeter 10,000’ research project \(which recruits individuals to help study common diseases\), who engaged with audience members and signed up 30 people to join the Exeter 10,000 project. The performance raised the profile of little\-known yet treatable blood disorders such as haemochromatosis and anaemia and promoted NHS blood donations: 

 *“The play itself was fabulous, linking past myths to our current medical understanding, combining art and entertainment as well as education about blood disorders*.” – Exeter 10,000 testimony \[ **5.9**\] 

 The project evaluation evidenced that over 80% of attendees had a better understanding of myth and medicine, \~70% said that they had an improved knowledge of blood disorders and over 60% said they were more likely to give blood. \[ **5.9**\] The collaboration was also significant for the artistic and commercial development of Four of Swords: 

 *“\[Groom\] pushed us to experiment with increasingly inventive ways of story\-telling; to cross boundaries and merge worlds which wouldn’t normally mix: folklore, historic characters, medical research, real\-world patients' experiences … We have definitely grown as a company through the collaboration, and have expanded our audience base hugely.” –* founder Phil Kingsplan John \[ **5.9**\] 

 **Inspiring the production of new performances and exhibitions** 

  

 In addition to the above, Groom’s work has inspired innovative theatrical productions that have re\-interpreted classic gothic texts, utilising his research to update them for contemporary audiences. In 2018, his reputation as a world\-renowned vampirologist resulted in an invitation to verify 26 books believed by the London Library to be the ones that Bram Stoker used to research Dracula. This internationally reported discovery led to a site\-specific dramatisation of *Dracula* by Creation Theatre in the London Library in February and March of 2019, in a run of 18 performances. The play directly uses lines from Groom’s *The Vampire* **\[5.10\]**. In 2018, he acted as the anchor/performer for ‘Living Literature – Frankenstein’, an immersive performance combining storytelling, workshops, music, science and theatre performed at Bath Literature Festival and the University of London School of Advanced Study. 

 Groom’s work on seasonal traditions similarly generated new creative works and increased public interest and engagement with calendrical traditions. A collaboration with folk band Woodwose created ‘A Hollantide Phantasmagoria’ – a mixed\-media, spoken word and music show. Three sell\-out performances were given in regional venues to coincide with Hollantide, once part of the Celtic New Year but subsequently known as All Saint’s Day and used to commemorate the forgotten dead, on November 1, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The project was subsequently featured as part of Exeter’s 2016 Being Human festival. 

 Groom’s research has also provoked reflection on the artistic, social and political forces that have played an important role in forming successive generations’ perceptions of the countryside. His 2013 essay *Country Supper*, which explored the history and meaning of the phrase after it appeared in text messages between Rebekah Brooks and David Cameron, inspired the 2017 art exhibition ‘Creating the Countryside: Thomas Gainsborough to Today’ at Compton Verney Art Gallery near Stratford\-upon\-Avon. Dr Rosemary Shirley, exhibition curator, stated that ‘ *The essay really acted as an inspiration point for the exhibition, particularly in terms of the assumptions made about contemporary rurality*.’ During its three\-month duration, the exhibition was seen by 15,000 visitors. \[ **5**. **11**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women, affecting >2,000,000 women globally each year. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with around 1,300,000 new cases globally each year. Cambridge University researchers led the development of the ‘PREDICT’ platforms. These are free\-of\-charge online tools which facilitate informed treatment decision making for clinicians and their patients with breast or prostate cancer. PREDICT Breast has had over 1,250,000 visits since 2014, including 330,000 in the UK and hundreds of thousands across North America, Europe, Australasia and South America. It is approved for clinical decision\-making by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence \(NICE\). It is estimated that PREDICT Breast led to 7,500 NHS patients being offered chemotherapy who would otherwise have not received it and, conversely, 11,000 women being appropriately spared unnecessary chemotherapy. Modelled on PREDICT Breast, PREDICT Prostate launched in 2019 has received 19,000 visits from the UK alone. 35% of men using this NICE endorsed decision\-making tool opt against unnecessary radical treatment, producing potential savings to the NHS of GBP46,000,000.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease. Following diagnosis, cancer patients and their physicians together make an informed decision about which treatment options will provide the greatest chance of extending or increasing the quality of life. This dialogue often occurs in a variety of clinical settings, from primary to tertiary care, and should consider the benefits and harm of treatment for the individual patient. Prior to 2010, there were very few tools freely or widely available to facilitate this decision\-making process. 

 Development of evidence\-based decision\-making tools to inform cancer treatment 

 Breast cancer–the commonest cancer in woman–affects more than 2,000,000 women across the world each year \(World Cancer Research Fund statistics\). Those with early breast cancer are faced with the difficult decision of whether to have chemotherapy, in addition to surgery, to increase their chance of cure. In 2010, Cambridge University researchers developed PREDICT Breast 1.0 to help inform treatment decisions for patients with early breast cancer \[1\]. This model deployed survival\-time data on 5,700 women with early breast cancer treated between 1999 and 2003 \[1\] and was validated using two independent data sets of over 8,000 women from the west Midlands and Canada \[2\]. The overall predictive accuracy of PREDICT Breast 1.0, particularly its ability to predict the value of chemotherapy in the context of other key variables, was confirmed in multiple independent case series. However, the model proved less accurate at predicting mortality risk in women aged <40 years \[Wong et al, 2015\]. Therefore, in 2017 PREDICT Breast 2.0 was developed to address this issue and is currently hosted by Public Health England as a free online tool \( [www.predict.nhs.uk](http://www.predict.nhs.uk/)\). Extensive collaboration was undertaken with the Cambridge Winton Centre for Risk & Evidence Communication to ensure effective communication of the model data.  PREDICT Breast 2.0 has subsequently been validated by several other research groups using multiple independent data sets \(Mokbel et al 2017; van Maaren et al 2017; Wu et al 2017; Gray et al 2018\). 

 Prostate cancer accounts for 26% of all new cancer cases in males in the UK \(Cancer Research UK statistics: 2017\). This incidence is increasing as the mean age of the population increases and screening becomes more widespread. Cambridge University\-led research has shown that >84% of UK men with prostate cancer have non\-metastatic disease at diagnosis \[3\]. Immediate radical therapy for many of these patients carries a high risk of severe adverse effects, including incontinence, impotence and bowel dysfunction, while providing little therapeutic benefit \[4\]. Therefore, building on the success of PREDICT Breast 2.0, between 2016 and 2019 Cambridge University researchers developed PREDICT Prostate – using data from >12,000 prostate cancer patients in two international cohorts – as the first online resource for individualised treatment decision making in the management of non\-metastatic prostate cancer \[5\]. This model estimated 10 and 15\-year survival outcomes for men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and was shown to outperform all other available international risk\-stratification models \(p<0.001\) \[5\]. A validation study involving >69,000 men showed that PREDICT Prostate was more effective at predicting outcome and the need for treatment compared with all other risk\-models \[6\]. PREDICT Prostate provides patients with estimated survival rates after treatment in the context of absolute mortality rate, i.e. the risk of death from prostate cancer alongside the absolute risk of dying, allowing the patient to make an informed decision as to the value of treatment and its potential side effects. Since March 2019 the model has been hosted by Public Health England as a free online tool \( [https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk](https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk/)\) **for men with non\-metastatic disease, where both conservative management and radical treatment options are being considered.**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impact on clinical practice 

 **Incorporation** **into UK guidelines:** 

-  In 2018, PREDICT Breast became the only tool recommended by UK NICE for planning the use of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and the management of early and locally advanced disease \(Guideline NG101\): *“Use the PREDICT tool to estimate prognosis and the absolute benefits of adjuvant therapy for women with invasive breast cancer*” \[A\]. 

-  NICE also recommend the use of PREDICT Breast for all patients with early breast cancer prior to other advanced molecular profiling \(Guideline NG34, 2018\) \[A\]. 

-  PREDICT Breast is also endorsed by the Breast Cancer Clinical Expert Group \[A\]. 

-  In 2019, NICE endorsed PREDICT Prostate as a resource to support decision making in the management of prostate cancer \(Guideline NG131\) \[B\]. 

-  The East of England Cancer Alliance \(EOECA\) also proposed PREDICT Prostate for clinical consideration in the Best Practice Prostate Pathway ‘ *...to provide a standardised personalised tool to help men make decisions via the MDT and clinic*’. 

-  Both PREDICT Breast and PREDICT Prostate are suggested by Cancer Research UK \(CRUK\) as tools to help patients make treatment decisions \[A, B\]. 

 **Incorporation into international guidelines:** In 2016, the American Joint Committee on Cancer \(AJCC\) established 13 criteria against which any new prognostic model should be evaluated before use in the clinical setting. PREDICT Breast was the only model to pass all criteria. It has since been officially endorsed in the 2018 edition of the AJCC: Cancer Staging manual *: “Thirty prognostication tools for breast cancer were identified and reviewed against a checklist derived from the PMC guidelines. Only two tools, Adjuvant\! Online* \[no longer available\] *and PREDICTv1.2 \(incorporation of HER2 into PREDICT, also known as PREDICT\-Plus\) were found to have met all predefined AJCC inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria”* \[C\]. 

 Impact on patient health and wellbeing 

 Breast cancer affects >2,000,000 women globally each year, while around 1,300,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed globally each year. PREDICT Breast and PREDICT Prostate are both provided as free online tools by Public Health England \( [https://breast.predict.nhs.uk/](https://breast.predict.nhs.uk/) and  [https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk](https://prostate.predict.nhs.uk/)\) to help cancer patients and physicians across the world make an informed decision about treatment options. Since 2014, PREDICT Breast received over 1,250,000 visits across the UK, North America, Europe, Australasia and South America \[D\]. Between its launch in March 2019 and November 2020, the PREDICT Prostate tool has been visited 28,000 times by 19,000 independent users from over 110 countries, and as of November 2020, it is averaging 250 visits a month with 51.5% as new users \[D\]. 

 In the breast units of most UK hospitals, PREDICT Breast has, as recommended by NICE guidelines \[A\], been adopted as the clinical management decision tool of choice; as of 2018, according to NICE, ‘ *most healthcare professionals \[…\] use the PREDICT \[Breast\] tool*’ \[E\]. The effectiveness and user\-friendly nature of the PREDICT Breast online tool is evidenced by qualitative user feedback from oncologists, such as that provided by clinicians to the Cambridge Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication \[E\], for example: 

-  “*I like the different ways of presenting the data to patients and the addition of the risk of death from causes other than breast cancer which provides a context for discussion*.” 

-  “*We use PREDICT tool often in clinic and find it very helpful in order to help patients understand and make informed decisions about their adjuvant treatment. Thank you\!*” 

 Patients have also provided feedback on PREDICT Breast \[E\]: 

-  24th Feb 2020: “ *Thank you, you have made my decision easier.*” 

-  23rd January 2019: “ *Hello. Thank you for this wonderful online tool for woman such as myself. By the way, I reside in Bangkok, Thailand*.” 

  

 Similarly, PREDICT Prostate has received positive user feedback from UK based Consultant Urologists and Prostate Cancer International, a cancer support website \[E\]: 

-  “*Predict is simply brilliant, Using it on my iPad with patients on a daily basis. Well done for producing such a great patient aid* “– JA, Stevenage, May 2019. 

-  “ *I use it and it’s a fantastic tool to guide discussions and help reassure patients\!*” \-HY, Kent, July 2020. 

-  “*Men ask me all the time, What is my risk for ED / incontinence / bowel dysfunction. My answer now will be that, ""That's impossible to project accurately on an individualized basis, but the PREDICT Prostate system can give you a decent estimate of that risk at 3 years post\-diagnosis"". I live in the very real world of ""What do you think I should I do?"" You've just made answering that question a lot easier for tens of thousands of men every year\!*” – Prostate Cancer International website **,** April 2019. 

 **Impact on treatment planning:** A clinical review of 200 patients managed by the Cambridge Breast Unit Multidisciplinary Team found 7.5% of breast cancer patients who would have been classified as low risk and not offered chemotherapy, were classified as high risk by PREDICT Breast and offered chemotherapy. Conversely, 11% of patients who would have been classified as high risk and offered chemotherapy, were reclassified as low risk and spared chemotherapy \[F\].  A conservative estimate – based on PREDICT Breast being the only tool recommended for adjuvant therapy planning by NICE and the number of online recorded visits to the website – is PREDICT Breast was used for at least 25% \(100,000\) of 400,000 new UK breast cancer cases recorded between 2013 and 2020. Extrapolation suggests that in the UK since 2013, PREDICT Breast will have resulted in \~7,500 women being offered chemotherapy who would otherwise not have been, and \~11,000 women being spared unnecessary chemotherapy. 

 A significant impact of PREDICT Prostate on treatment planning was shown also in a study of \~200 doctors and specialist nurses. This revealed PREDICT Prostate led to a \~60% reduction in the likelihood of recommending radical treatment to patients, with 80% of clinicians stating PREDICT Prostate is a useful clinical tool \[G\]. 

 The PREDICT Prostate patient impact study \(2018\-2020\) further demonstrated benefit to patients. This study involved 156 patients across eight UK centres, randomised to either standard of care \(SOC\) information \(n=75\), or SOC and the PREDICT Prostate web\-tool \(n=81\). Mean decisional conflict scores \(a measure of perception of uncertainty in choosing options\) were 21.5 and 15.9 in the SOC and PREDICT Prostate groups respectively, representing a 26% reduction \(p=0.01\). Anxiety was not increased in the PREDICT arm. In total, 58% of men reported PREDICT Prostate estimates for prostate cancer specific mortality were lower than expected and 35% were less likely to select radical treatment. Over 90% of patients in the PREDICT Prostate group found it useful and would recommend it to others \[H\]. 

 Impact on the economy 

 **Cost savings due to reduction in overtreatment of cancer:** Overtreatment of cancer incurs unnecessary costs for the NHS, principally through avoidable treatment expenses and the management of any side effects. As detailed above, it is estimated that PREDICT Breast has resulted in \~7,500 more women with breast cancer in the UK being offered chemotherapy, and \~11,000 women being spared unnecessary treatment, with associated cost savings to the NHS relating to the cost of adjuvant chemotherapy for 4,500 women. 

 Overtreatment of prostate cancer can result in significant costs for unnecessary therapy \(e.g. prostatectomy costs \~GBP7,000 \[2020/21 NHS National Tariff Payment System\]\) and side effect management \(e.g. incontinence, erectile failure, bowel dysfunction\) without any clear benefit to patient survival. Data from the National Prostate Cancer Audit shows that 4\-8% of men with low\-risk disease and 30\-40% of men with intermediate risk disease for whom use of PREDICT Prostate would be suitable, are receiving potentially unnecessary radical therapy every year \[G\].  Based on 19,000 UK visitors to PREDICT Prostate since 2019 \[A, H\], and on the figures from the PREDICT Prostate Study \[G\] in which 35% \(approximately 6,600\) decided not to proceed with radical treatment, such as prostatectomy, this would equate to NHS savings of approximately GBP46,000,000 per year. 

 **Licensing of PREDICT algorithm: the PREDICT Breast algorithm has been licensed to Portable Medical Technologies and is incorporated into their OncoAssist app. The PREDICT algorithm has been licensed by Cambridge Enterprise to Portable Medical Technologies \(whose clients include Microsoft, AMGEN, Dorset Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and The Clatterbridge NHS Cancer Centre\) and it is incorporated into their OncoAssist app.  **\[text removed for publication\]** \[I\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Louise Sylvester’s research has significantly impacted on the activities of two key institutional beneficiaries in their mission to engage young people, their families and the wider public with the language and literature of the medieval period: 

-  The **Chaucer Heritage Trust** has been revitalised and met its remit as a charity to promote the work of Chaucer to a wide public audience, via engagement activities devised by Sylvester as one its Trustees. 

-  The **National Archives** have innovated their public engagement and educational practices around their Medieval collections, and developed longer term strategies in this area, on the basis of their collaborations with Sylvester’s team, enabling them to meet their strategic aim of expanding their audience base, particularly among young people. 

 The realisation of these two institutional impacts has also resulted in the pedagogical impact of enhancing the understanding of medieval language and literature for more than two thousand school pupils, particularly across Key Stages 2, 3 and 5, through the various educational activities designed by Sylvester and through the creation of an accessible website on the medieval vocabulary of cloth and clothing designed specifically to engage young learners.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Sylvester’s research over the last thirteen years has established her as a leading international expert on the lexicon and semantics of Middle English and on the medieval language of cloth and clothing. Her studies of semantic change in the medieval period, including her analyses of vocabulary in Chaucer’s writings \(e.g. output \[1\]\), led to her co\-editing of the book *Teaching Chaucer* in Palgrave’s ‘Teaching the New English’ series \[2\]. The book explored different ways of engaging students with Chaucer in the classroom, researching pedagogical approaches to his works and recommending best practice pedagogical methods.  [*The Medieval Review*](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view/16549) praised its “approach \[to\] the challenges of teaching Chaucer \(and his Middle English\) from a myriad of stimulating perspectives”. Sylvester wrote the chapter on the language of Chaucer which looks at his literary works through the lens of the author’s linguistic choices and delineates a historical\-stylistic approach to the literature. In this way, Sylvester highlighted how the study of Chaucer’s work can still be of much relevance to contemporary students. 

 Furthering her research on the lexicon and semantics of Medieval English, Sylvester was also Co\-Investigator on a large 5\-year project grant from the AHRC to explore the lexis of textiles and dress in Medieval Britain, with Professor Gale Owen\-Crocker at the University of Manchester. The major output of *The Lexis of Cloth and Clothing c. 700\-1450* project was a ground\-breaking multilingual dictionary of terms that was officially launched in 2012 and is freely available online \[3\]. The website takes the form of a comprehensive and searchable open access database that includes definitions, citations, etymologies, and semantic cognates. It is the first historical multilingual lexical resource of its kind, collecting together terminology for textiles, garments, armour and accessories in all the languages used in Medieval Britain \(including Anglo\-Norman, Cornish, Flemish, Irish, Manx, Medieval Latin, Middle English, Norn, Norse, Old English, Old Scots, Scots Gaelic and Welsh\). The site also includes descriptions of the place of these instances of textiles in medieval British society, as well as a gallery of images of archaeological finds and tomb art showing the dress and textiles of the period. Across the duration of the project \(up to December 2012\) the site received 634,358 hits \(an average of approximately 8,800 per month\), and 65,276 unique visitors to the site. The project was identified by  [The History of Parliament project](https://thehistoryofparliament.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/round-table-session-digital-humanities-and-political-history-in-memoriam-valerie-cromwell/) \(funded by the two Houses of Parliament\) as one of two “shining examples” of “ground\-breaking digital humanities projects covering the middle ages”. 

 Coinciding with this web\-based project, Sylvester was Principal Investigator for a three\-year Leverhulme Trust\-funded project, *Medieval Dress and Textile Vocabulary in Unpublished Sources,* which ran from 2009 to 2012. The project involved examining archived medieval manuscripts and nineteenth\-century printed materials, from epic and romance texts to petitions to Parliament, extracts from wills, satirical works, and the expenses accounts of households – including that of the Royal family – in order to draw a new picture of the range of clothing that was worn in the period \(encompassing everything from wedding dresses to cooks’ uniforms\) and of the terminology used to describe it. Many of these texts were transcribed, edited and translated – from Middle English, Anglo\-French and Latin \(or a mixture of these languages\) – for the very first time in the project’s major output, *Medieval Dress and Textiles in Britain: A Multilingual Sourcebook*, published in 2014 \[4\]. With scanned images of the source texts, accompanying translations and commentary, as well as a glossary, the text provides readers and researchers from across various disciplinary fields \(including literature, history, archaeology and sociology\) with unprecedented access and insight into the lived culture of medieval Britain. 

 Subsequently, Sylvester has made additional use of the research base assembled for this project in further research into how different medieval text types employ technical terminology in the establishment of the conventions of their genres \[5,6\], as well as in an AHRC\-funded project, 'Medieval English \(ca600\-1500\) in a Multilingual Context' \(£33,855\), for which she is Co\-I, and which has informed recent collaborations with the National Archives detailed below.

#  Innovating the public engagement practices of the Chaucer Heritage Trust 

 As a result of her research expertise as “an English specialist with profound knowledge of Chaucer and Middle English”, Sylvester was appointed in 2013 as a Trustee of the Chaucer Heritage Trust \(CHT\) \[a\-i\]. She has since helped both to **revive the institution of the CHT and to fulfil its Charity mandate of promoting awareness of Chaucer’s work**. 

 The CHT was established in 1992 but underwent several years of decline, during which it lost its Charity status. It received a significant endowment in 2010, allowing it to resume its activities and appoint new trustees. The “objectives of the trust are furthering general public interest, understanding and appreciation of the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, his life and times and influence, and his position in English and world literature” \[a\-i\]. 

 A key activity that Sylvester devised as a Trustee to **extend the CHT’s reach and profile**, and so fulfil its mandate and thus maintain its Charity status, is “The Canterbury Tales Writing Competition”. Designed by Sylvester, who also reviewed the large number of entries, the competition invited children in three different age groups to write a poem about a journey, a beast fable, or an account of a new pilgrim in prose or verse. This approach is based on Sylvester’s research on best practice pedagogy that developed out of her *Teaching Chaucer* volume \(output \[2\]\) and encourages understanding of Chaucer’s writings in a creative fashion. Along with individual prize money for winning entrants, the prize\-winning schools also receive funding for their school libraries from the competition each year, amounting to a total of £15,750 to date. 

 In its first year \(2017\-18\), Sylvester and colleagues managed to attract three especially high\-profile judges for the competition, Stephen Fry \(a popular actor, comedian and writer\), Patience Agbabi \(author of the acclaimed *Telling Tales*, a modern reinvention of *The Canterbury Tales* for children\) and Gail Ashton \(a poet and biographer of Chaucer\), thus significantly raising the profile of the CHT itself. The competition subsequently received over 500 entries submitted via the CHT  [website](http://chaucer.org.uk/). The following years’ competitions attracted circa 800 and 600 entries in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and more than 750 entries by the beginning of 2021 for the most recent competition \[a\-ii\]. This range of more than 2,500 poems and stories received, as well as the promotion of the competition by schools themselves and their encouragement of students’ entries, clearly demonstrates the ways in which the competition has **succeeded in** **engaging young people with medieval literature in creative and innovative ways** \[a\-iii\]. As another of the CHT Trustees \(a Charity Lawyer\) confirms: 

 “None of this would have got off the ground or been the success it has without your \[Sylvester’s\] efforts and input. **The charity is now well established again and active in carrying out its objectives, which I must attribute to you**. \[…\] I believe we have already had a considerable impact, for which you deserve most of the credit” \[a\-i\]. 

 Among other initiatives, Sylvester has also taken the lead in devising a Schools Visits  [programme](https://chaucer.org.uk/talks-and-workshops/), whereby the CHT has provided dedicated one\-hour workshops on Chaucer’s writings, often for several groups in a day. 26 schools have participated in the visits to date \(with 2 further online sessions since the start of the pandemic\), many over several successive years, with a total reach of more than 2,000 children since 2017. Sessions were specifically offered to Key Stage 2 and 3 \(7\-14 year old\) students at schools that do not have Chaucer on their syllabus, thus **raising awareness of Chaucer among children who had not had a chance to study medieval literature before**, as well as Key Stage 5 \(16\-19 year old\) students, to provide **enhanced understanding of Chaucer relevant to A Level exams**. In all such cases, schools were invited to get in touch to discuss the workshops so that they would be tailored to their specific needs. Example feedback from teachers attesting to the beneficial pedagogical impact of the sessions on students’ understanding across the various Key Stages, include: “The information was very useful for \[the\] A Level exam” \(KS5\), “Fantastic introduction to Chaucer and highly engaging\!” \(KS2\), and “Students are excited about Chaucer, language, storytelling, and the competition” \(KS5\) \[a\-iv\]. 

 As a teacher of English at one state school in Norwich testified: 

 “Four years ago, our school started teaching Chaucer to our Year 7 students. … \[CHT have\] worked with us to schedule workshops for the whole of our Y7 cohort … we have found that they often spark a deeper interest in Chaucer's colourful characters. The **students have benefited hugely from the workshops**, especially as it has enabled them to engage with the Canterbury Tales outside of their usual classroom experience” \[a\-v\]. 

#  Strengthening public engagement practice and strategy at The National Archives 

 In 2015, Sylvester was awarded a one\-year follow up grant of £78,925 from the AHRC to develop the public engagement and impact opportunities generated by the *Lexis of Cloth and Clothing in Britain* project \(output \[3\] above\) through collaboration with The National Archives *.* Sylvester was Principal Investigator leading a team including Dr Mark Chambers \(Durham University\), Research Associate Dr Charles Farris \(then at the University of Westminster and now Public Historian at Historic Royal Palaces and administrator at the Chaucer Heritage Trust\), and Dr Laura Tompkins of The National Archives as Project Advisor. As a result of the collaboration, Sylvester and colleagues have had the **institutional impact of enhancing public engagement practices and strategies at The National Archives around their medieval collections.** 

 The National Archives \[TNA\] is a non\-ministerial government department and is “the official archive of the UK government and for England and Wales”, and “guardian of some of the nation's most iconic documents, dating back more than 1,000 years” \[b\-i\]. Paul Dryburgh, Principal Record Specialist at TNA, confirms that the collaboration with Sylvester and Farris “has **encouraged The National Archives to innovate in its presentation of collections to children and their parents** and given it the freedom to rethink how we engage different audiences with medieval collections in new ways” \[b\-ii\]. 

 As Dryburgh states, the significance of this intervention is that, of the many collections in their care, “medieval and early modern records have unique linguistic, palaeographical and conceptual challenges that means our engagement strategies have to be particularly innovative and supported, often, by external partners” \[b\-ii\]. It is in this connection that Sylvester and Farris were engaged by Tompkins and Dryburgh: “both to test out new ideas and spaces and to broaden the audiences that visit the archives” \[b\-ii\]. In particular, Dryburgh notes, TNA were keen to meet “the needs of one of our identified audiences, *Family for Me*” \[b\-ii\], an audience segment focused on “children or grandchildren” who, according to TNA’s own audience research, “cite learning as their motivation and high expectation that we will deliver a family learning experience” \[b\-iii\]. 

 As Dryburgh makes clear, each of the project team’s activities has thus had the institutional impact of **contributing directly to the fulfilment of goals identified by TNA itself to bring the cultural and linguistic heritage embodied in their archives to a wider public audience**. 

 To realise such impact, the project team maintained a collaborative relationship with TNA over several years. Outcomes of the collaboration have included, for example, two large\-scale events devised specifically to fulfil the particular public engagement requirements of TNA: the Tudor Takeover Day, a family fun day that attracted over 300 visitors in 2016, and Medieval Murmurings, a  [Time Travel Club](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/time-travel-club-activities/) event targeted at Key Stage 1 and 2 pupils \(5\-11 year olds\), which attracted over 100 families in 2019. These, as Dryburgh attests, “owed their greatest inspiration to the LEXIS and \[AHRC\] Multilingualism projects” \[b\-ii\]. For example, as Dryburgh notes, the “financial and intellectual support of the LEXIS project enabled the Education team to develop a lesson focussing on the imagery of majesty under Henry VIII”, “added rigour to the discussion of the king’s robes and tournament finery” and engaged “participants \[with\] the origins of certain concepts in royal fashion” \[b\-ii\]. Other events included inventive suites of activities for children and adults, as well as taught classroom sessions, storytelling, workshops and craft activities that increased awareness and understanding of the culture of the period for young people and a non\-academic audience. 

 Designed by Sylvester and her team, such events, Dryburgh confirms, successfully “met the needs” of TNA’s target audience, “ *Family for Me*” \[b\-ii\], thus **helping TNA to fulfil its educational mission as a publicly\-funded body** \[b\-iii\]. The Education Manager at TNA states of the Tudor Takeover Day: “The workshops were brilliantly attended, with turn\-out far exceeding expectations” \[b\-iv\]. As Dryburgh attests: “Both could not have been planned or delivered without the intellectual and financial input of the LEXIS project team” \[b\-ii\]. 

 Dryburgh has further testified that: “The collaboration has maintained **a strong legacy in delivery of education events relating to pre\-modern records”** \[b\-ii\]. The approach of Sylvester’s team to “work\[ing\] with school children, was invaluable” and has been more broadly adopted, as Dryburgh confirms, in TNA’s public engagement strategies around its medieval collections due to its successful enhancement of the understanding of this audience segment, as evidenced by a range of attendee feedback \[b\-ii\]. Of the Tudor Takeover Day, the Education Manager at TNA states, for example, that: “All of the feedback we received from the families taking part, rated the sessions as ‘excellent’” \[b\-iv\]. Visitor feedback for Medieval Murmurings describes the event as “inspiring” and “enlightening”, with one respondent stating for example: “I came out with a lot of new knowledge ... Very glad and grateful I came here today” \[b\-iv\]. 

#  Enhancing the accessibility of the National Archives to researchers 

 The collaboration with TNA has had further institutional impact in the devising of programmes aimed specifically at **securing long\-term gains in archival training and practice** through their impact on students and researchers. For instance, Sylvester’s involvement in the AHRC\-funded 'Medieval English \(ca600\-1500\) in a Multilingual Context’ project “has led to the organisation \[in 2020\] of a two\-day conference and multi\-disciplinary student training day” at TNA that was originally planned to be held in January 2021 on the use of Anglo\-Norman in the Middle Ages \[b\-ii\]. As “little formal training in the language is available in UK HE institutions”, such a programme, Dryburgh notes, “plays a crucial role in **helping to train future generations of historians, archivists and linguists** to access these documents, and students will be able to investigate and discuss key issues by using original records” \[b\-ii\]. As well as impacting upon the strategy of TNA in how they utilise their rich medieval archives for diverse audiences, Sylvester’s research collaboration is thus also helping to maintain accessibility for students and others at both the institution itself and across the sector. 

#  Enhancing understanding of medieval language and culture among school children 

 Sylvester’s AHRC follow\-up funding for the *Lexis of Cloth and Clothing in Britain* project \(output \[3\]\) in 2015\-16 was further used to create a new  [website](https://medievalroyalwardrobelexis.wordpress.com/) – Lexis of Cloth and Clothing in Medieval Royal Wardrobe Accounts – specifically aimed at **making the existing Lexis database more engaging and accessible to younger users** \[c\-i\]. This site features user\-friendly text for a younger audience – often connected to contemporary events of the day \(like the State opening of Parliament\) – alongside photographic images of manuscripts and commissioned illustrations by the children’s book author and artist Maggie Kneen. 

 A key part of the site is its dedicated section  [For Schools](https://medievalroyalwardrobelexis.wordpress.com/for-schools/) \[c\-i\], which features lesson plans and activities for Key Stage 3 students \(11\-14 year olds\), created on the basis of best practice developed across workshops undertaken by the project team \(Sylvester and Farris\) at 15 schools in London, Worcestershire, Shropshire and County Durham with a reach of c.350 students. Such sessions were tailored to complement KS3 syllabuses in English, History, Citizenship and Geography, and included sessions in which the pupils also used the more complex *Lexis* project database to discover medieval names for fabrics and garments. These activities thus **provided students with KS3 syllabus\-relevant knowledge for their education in a range of subjects and enhanced their wider understanding of medieval language and culture**, as well as web\-based skills through their directed usage of the archive. 

 Of the 148 individual feedback forms received, 74% rated their session “Very Good” or “Excellent” \[c\-ii\]. Just as importantly, teaching staff praised the beneficial pedagogical impact of the sessions. For instance, one teacher wrote: “The girls and boys loved it. Your materials were just perfectly tailored to Year 7 age group and really got them motivated and keen to participate in all the activities” \[c\-ii\]. As one teacher noted in their feedback on the sessions: “I will be using the database\!” \[c\-ii\]. 

 The workshops also further **assisted in** **realising The National Archives’ institutional objective of “inspiring the public with new ways of using and experiencing our collection”** through the display of art made by children at these workshops as part of a three\-month exhibition of TNA’s Royal Wardrobe collection at the Keeper’s Gallery \[c\-iii\]. This art was on display from December 2016 through to March 2017, alongside 10 manuscripts and the project team’s edited and translated extracts from the Royal Wardrobe accounts of Edward I, II and III. The exhibition had, according to the Gallery’s own figures, around 200 regular visitors per month plus around 400 further students who visited the gallery as part of their sessions with the Education team, bringing in an audience of circa 1,800 mostly young people for TNA’s medieval holdings \[c\-iv\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Collaborative research carried out at Lancaster University has resulted in a first\-of\-a\-kind data\-driven drainage management service \(SmartWater\) used across the UK to help reduce surface water flooding. SmartWater, a commercial service implemented by InTouch Ltd is available in the UK with patents pending in Europe, the US and Hong Kong. It currently supports the management of **over 643,142 drainage assets**, accounting for approximately **4.6% of all roadside drains \(gullies\) in the UK**. Highway maintainers estimate that using SmartWater they accrue **cost\-savings totalling over 20% annually**, with a **25% reduction in emergency callouts across contracts**. Lancaster's research contribution in the design of IoT drainage analytics and understanding issues of mistrust amongst asset maintenance stakeholders has underpinned the user\-centred design of SmartWater and has been pivotal in the adoption and user acceptance of SmartWater within a domain that has traditionally been slow to innovate. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The SmartWater system builds on two distinct sets of underpinning research \- the development of a set of techniques for helping establish trustworthy data systems in the highways sector and the creation of an IoT platform for precision surface water management. 

 Lancaster’s work on trustworthy data systems drew on an initial collaboration with Carillion PLC and InTouch Ltd as part of the OurTravel **\[G1\]** project \(Real\-Time Context Sensitive Travel Information for Communities’ \(2009\-2011\) that developed the world's first travel information system capable of reporting context\-sensitive highway maintenance information through journey\-based social networks, similar to how Google's Waze service provisions travel information today. Lancaster’s findings highlighted the need to address emerging upstream maintenance information reliability issues and more critically, the deep\-rooted mistrust issues that negatively affect highway maintenance data exchange between local authorities and highways maintainers **\[3.3\]**, along with its use by travellers. InTouch Ltd exploited this new understanding of emerging trust challenges within the transport maintenance sector by developing a UK leading mobile works orders management platform \(WOMs\). WOMs created a mobile inspection data capture system that integrated trusted highways maintenance information with social travel network feeds.  It enabled the direct dissemination of context\-sensitive maintenance information to personal travellers and workers in the field undertaking infrastructure management tasks. As a leading highways maintainer at the time, Carillion PLC acted as a conduit for the research, providing access to drainage operatives that allowed Lancaster to examine their work practice and use of WOM technology within a real\-world setting. 

 Building on the insights from OurTravel, FAITH: Building Trust Between Citizens, Local Authorities and Contractors \(2011\-2013\) **\[G2\]** set out to investigate more broadly the role of trust in highway maintenance, developing new tools and guidance for the sector \(including both academic publications and industry white papers\) that provided actionable guidance on how greater levels of trustworthiness can be designed into digital solutions **\[3.2\]**. In collaboration with Carillion PLC, InTouch Ltd, and Redcar & Cleveland Council, Lancaster worked with local management authorities to investigate and mitigate mistrust amongst highway maintenance stakeholders. Consequently, new guidelines were developed to inform the future design of civic transport management technologies that aimed to facilitate greater transparency and trustworthiness by design **\[3.1\]**. InTouch were able to utilise these findings to inform the product development of new drainage inspection capabilities. 

 In parallel with underpinning research on trustworthy data systems, Lancaster also began to explore the use of open IoT data in highways maintenance. In particular, Lancaster facilitated workshops that brought together industry leaders \(i.e. Carillion, Balfour Beatty, Amey\) to explore barriers to data accessibility and interoperability. Based on the requirements identified from industry, Lancaster’s was able to contribute to new industry data standards \[e.g. PAS 212:2016 \- Automatic resource discovery for the Internet of Things\] and tools \(i.e. SmartStreets IoT Hub **\[G3\]**\). These developments lowered the cost of provisioning and integrating highway related datasets. This work led to a focus on drainage management – addressing the need for the sector to comply with new UK Government legislation \( [Flood & Water Management Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/29/enacted/data.xht?view=snippet&wrap=true)\) that created greater expectations for transport infrastructure maintainers to improve the management of roadside drainage and mitigate the impact of flooding. In collaboration with InTouch and Mott MacDonald as part of the SmartClean: Data\-driven Precision Surface Water Management for Urban Environments \(2015\-2017\) project **\[G4\]**, Lancaster developed 1\) a novel IoT sensor that is now at the heart of SmartWater, along with 2\) the supporting statistical models to monitor and predict roadside drainage conditions. Lancaster’s research into the use and configuration of LoRa **\[3.5\]**, which is a low\-power, long\-range wireless communications medium, has underpinned the transformative capabilities of SmartWater as an end\-to\-end drainage decision\-support solution. 

 Together these two strands of underpinning research have led to the development of a system that transforms manual, reactive transport infrastructure maintenance practices through the curation and development of new forms of data to support more informed, proactive maintenance decision\-making. Following the recent commercial impact of the SmartClean research within the highways sector, Lancaster and InTouch partnered with Network Rail as part of the TrackWater: Supporting High\-Value, Low\-Cost Rail Network Drainage Asset Management \(2017\-2019\) **\[G5\]** and TrackWater2.0 \(2019\-2020\) **\[G6\]** projects to assess and evaluate the feasibility of utilising SmartWater in track\-side drainage management. Lancaster applied previous learning in highways maintenance to increase understanding of the sociotechnical implications of leveraging predictive drainage analytics **\[3.4\]** and inform organisational changes and technical adaptations to meet the needs of rail operatives.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Lancaster University’s research into the design and implementation of trustworthy data systems and its application to drainage and gully management has had significant impacts in three key areas: 1\) on the working practices, business models and commercial success of the partner organisation InTouch Ltd.; 2\) cost\-savings through the introduction of more efficient monitoring systems for local authorities, contractors and Highways England resulting in improvements to local and national road infrastructure maintenance; and 3\) the application of these systems to national rail infrastructure through collaborations with Network Rail. 

#  4.1 Impact on the working practices, business models and commercial success of InTouch Ltd. 

 InTouch Ltd are a software development and telecom company based in **Morecambe** in the North West of England.  Until the early 2000s, the company specialised in managed radio communications solutions for the construction industry but seeing a shift in their markets to more digital platforms, InTouch partnered with Lancaster University to innovate. That partnership has resulted in an entirely new area of business for InTouch in drainage asset management and flood prevention. The positive impact this partnership has had for both InTouch and the local economy was lauded by David Morris MP \(Morecambe and Lunesdale\), who stated that: *“The benefit of having a world leading University on the doorstep facilitates SME’s such as InTouch Ltd to take advantage of this incredible resource to allow them to work in markets which they could not hope to achieve without them. InTouch Ltd is a fine example of a long\-established business which needed to move with the times and move into being a research led business to be able to maintain and develop new markets.”* He goes on to note how *“Having a world leading solution to an ever\-increasing flooding problem in the Morecambe and Lunesdale constituency is exactly the type of business we strive for – high quality jobs, high quality solution and great opportunities for expansion”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 This *“blossoming”* partnership **\[5.1\]** has reached maturity within the audit period, resulting in the creation of SmartWater \(2015\) an innovative, market\-leading drainage management and flood prevention solution. SmartWater uses IoT sensor technologies and real\-time weather information to monitor gullies, predict flood risk and facilitate more proactive drainage maintenance. This shift in maintenance practice has seen a reduction in maintenance costs among key maintenance providers and clients **of up to 50% \[5.2\]**. 

 InTouch has successfully taken SmartWater products to market and the company has seen significant growth as a consequence. During the REF impact period, InTouch expanded its workforce to accommodate for this strand of its business provision, **hiring 13 highly skilled members of staff** and restructuring a further **3 existing roles** to support the management and rollout of related products and services between 2013 and 2021. The SmartWater system is responsible for the management of over **643,142 gullies** and accounts for around **4.6% of all gully drains in the UK**. The value of the company has grown by **65% between 2013 and 2020**, and it now works with **22 local authorities and road maintenance contractors**, with the list of clients continuing to grow **\[5.2\]**. John Walden, Managing Director of InTouch, sees a direct link between his company's success and its engagement with Lancaster University research: *“Our collaboration with Lancaster University and highways maintenance companies such as Carillion, Amey and Balfour Beatty has totally transformed our company. We knew that if we were to take a long\-term strategic look at the data and communications industry and predict the likely advances in innovation, we needed academic input and our working with Lancaster University in consortiums has helped to strengthen the long\-term viability of the company. I’d urge ‘more small companies to take advantage of how universities have opened up their fantastic resources to businesses like ours”* **\[5.2\]**. 

#  4.2 Cost\-savings for local authorities, contractors and Highways England arising from SmartWater and related products. 

##  *a\) Local Authorities and Maintenance Contractors* 

 Thanks to the introduction of adaptive data monitoring and asset management products developed in partnership with Lancaster University, impacts have been realised by InTouch’s large and expanding client base. Drawing on data from across its portfolio, estimates suggest that the introduction of SmartWater results in average cost\-savings of **over 20% annually \(and as high as 50%\)**, including **a reduction in callouts by 25%**, and an estimated **reduction in flood incidents by 20% \[5.2, 5.6\]**. The deployment of these systems has helped local authorities and contractors to shift maintenance procedures from cyclical, annual cleansing to a more efficient and proactive approach, identifying and targeting specific gullies that are more prone to blockages. The system is able to learn and adapt to prevailing environmental conditions and thereby identify clusters of gullies that are at higher risk of flooding which can then be targeted with remedial work. For example, Knowsley MBC Highways & Transportation have stated that because of the introduction of SmartWater monitoring systems *“we are now able to target the high\-risk gullies with an efficiency\-driven approach”*. Similarly, the Asset Officer at Stirling Council has commented on how: *“The introduction of the InTouch Inspection software has improved the trust we have in our contractor, we now have the tools to see daily activity of the cleaning schedule and by viewing the photographs taken, we can reduce the number of on\-site inspections of our gully assets. **As a direct result of implementing this solution we have made a significant saving this year in emergency flooding callouts**”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 Local authorities have also commented on the long\-term transformational impact SmartWater has had on the way they manage their drainage systems. In a recent Highways Infrastructure Asset Management report \(2018\), Plymouth City Council described how: *“The SmartWater system produces focussed work schedules to target only those gullies that need attention, namely gullies that are blocked,* \[or\] *close to becoming blocked… In a first iteration of implementing the system, we would expect the three categories of gullies identified to equate to 20\-25% of the gully stock based on empirical evidence of a number of years of research and implementation of this system in other local authorities. Subsequent iterations of the system should see the numbers of gullies that need to be targeted \[for cleansing\] reduce toward 10% and maybe even lower”* **\[5.4\]**. Reducing the number of gully visits required, naturally reduces the overall cost of system cleansing. 

 The savings accrued from the implementation of the SmartWater system are significant. Bristol City Council have recorded a significant **80% reduction in the number of callouts** due to flooding on its roads, a reduction in the prevalence of potholes due to reduced surface water, and **the number of blocked gullies in the city are down from 18% to 5%**. This has been realised in a fall in the budget required for highways flood prevention from **GBP431,000 in 2014**, to **GBP150,000 in 2018, a reduction of 65.2%** at a time when all local authorities are facing intense budgetary restraints **\[5.5\]**. 

 SmartWater has also provided highways maintenance companies with a novel platform offering richer and more transparent information to their clients. This has improved trust relationships between local authorities and the companies they hire to conduct maintenance and ultimately helped them address the legal responsibility placed on them to manage highways flooding.  One such maintenance company with multiple cleaning subcontracts was Carillion. In 2018, Carillion commented on the benefits arising from SmartWater in their *“ability to build strong business partnerships”* with local authorities and were committed to continue supporting the rollout of SmartWater technologies, and to *“implement them further in different contracts”* **\[5.7\]**. This work has continued under other contractors, including Amey and Balfour Beatty, who combined, maintain thousands of miles of road and rail across the UK. Amey have emulated the SmartWater solutions to develop their own related products, helping them achieve several notable contract deals, including one with Yorkshire Water worth GBP100million **\[5.8\]**. 

##  *b\) Highways England* 

 Highways England, the UK government’s road operations and maintenance agency, has funded in\-field trials of SmartWater gully sensor and wireless communication infrastructure on the M25 motorway to assess the environmental, economic and societal impacts of real\-time drainage asset monitoring in known flood hotspot areas **\[5.2\]**. A second Highways England trial on the M6 Smart Motorway \(J21\-26\) has been undertaken with 54 sensors deployed in the first 12 months, demonstrating the applicability of the technology in different environmental conditions and to different types of assets. 

 These trials have been reflected in UK wide policy. The Department for Transport created an initiative to link SMEs developing innovative solutions in the highways sector with a network of relevant agencies, organisations and local authorities as part of the Connected Places Catapult and this has fed into the work with InTouch Ltd. On the subject of gully management, Steve Berry OBE at Department for Transport has said, *“Since 2016, the Department for Transport has been encouraging all highway authorities and the wider sector to adopt a risk\-based approach to their maintenance service. We are also encouraging all those who maintain highways to adopt new and emerging technologies as part of their highway service. This should include consideration of new ideas, methods of working and innovation in order to drive greater efficiency.”* He goes on to note *“SmartWater, developed by InTouch, in collaboration with Lancaster University, is one example of a real problem being solved by utilising a robust technology solution. **The novel way of combining sensors, changing working patterns and large data analysis not only helps reduce risk and the number of flooding events, but also increases efficiency and can offer value for money**”* **\[5.9\]**. 

 InTouch have recently \(2019\-2020\) partnered with The Highways Agency to carry out SmartWater trials on the M25. 55 sensors were integrated into existing smart lighting infrastructure to inform the cleaning regime of high value drainage assets. Positive results from the initial deployment has created confidence in the process and led to its wider implementation to include four junctions on the M6.  The work has received positive comment from the Department of Transport *“At the last two LCRIG \(Local Council Roads Innovation Group\) events, I was pleased to see the early adopters praising the SmartWater solution in their presentations and allowing the audience to understand the benefits that can be achieved using this solution”* **\[5.9\]**. 

#  4.3 SmartWater technologies for Network Rail 

 Between 2017 and 2020 InTouch deployed SmartWater in two collaborative R&D projects with Network Rail \(TrackWater **\[G5\]** and TrackWater2 **\[G6\]**\).  Network Rail's lead R&D Programme Manager stated ""The first phase \[TrackWater\] went so well that we decided to do another phase funded entirely by us. TrackWater 2.0 is the second phase within Network Rail trialling SmartWater in three different regions at flood prone sites"" **\[5.10\]**. The project has already seen improvements to drainage efficiency, reduced disruption to rail traffic and improved rail worker safety, as manual inspections of trackside catch\-pits in hazardous 'red zones' were needed less frequently. **\[5.10\].** The success of these trials has seen TrackWater shortlisted as **one of only five projects \(out of 130\) to be presented as a leading R&D project for Network Rail,** and was given publicity in *Railway International*, where it describes how *“the use of real\-time information and automation* \[promoted through the TrackWater project\] *will equip Network Rail with the ability to keep a tab on the rail infrastructure’s drainage system and mitigate drainage\-related issues on the tracks”* **\[5.11\]**. Application of this technology to the UK’s national rail network is ongoing, but Network Rail have committed to the next phases of its implementation in the coming years **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Forecasting temperatures in urban areas is extremely challenging owing to the complexity of urban surfaces, and yet it benefits a range of users, including the road, rail and aviation sectors. In collaboration with the UK Met Office \(MO\), researchers at Reading produced a model of how buildings exchange heat with the atmosphere in a representative “street canyon,” validated using a novel wind tunnel technique. Further development and testing against unique unit field data produced the MO\-Reading Urban Surface Exchange Scheme or MORUSES. MORUSES was implemented in the UK operational forecast model \(UKV\) in 2016 which led directly to improved temperature forecasts, critical for public health through early warning forecasts of heatwaves in urban areas. Its inclusion in the world\-leading UKCP18 Local \(2.2 km\) climate projections is improving the capability of city authorities such as Bristol and London to plan for future climate adaptation. One of the MO’s strategic goals is to provide urban forecasts approaching 100 m resolution by 2030: MORUSES is at the heart of its aim to provide high quality predictions of urban weather and climate.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2018, the United Nations  [reported](https://population.un.org/wup/Publications/Files/WUP2018-Report.pdf) that 83% of the UK population lived in urban areas, where 10,000 people or more are living. Urban areas have their own micro\-climate, with major impact on wind, temperature and even humidity. When heated by the sun, urban surfaces cool down more slowly than surrounding areas, producing “urban heat islands” \(UHI\). Within cities, neighbourhoods consist of buildings of different materials and streets of different widths which affect how heat is exchanged between the surface and the atmosphere. The challenge is to capture the diversity of neighbourhoods yet represent the physics simply enough to include in a weather forecast model. Work to devise an urban surface scheme by scientists in the unit was led by Professor Stephen Belcher who worked in the unit until 2016. 

 A simple starting point is to assume that all streets are ‘street canyons’ – parallel rows of buildings of the same height. Heat is transferred from four different facets \- street, two walls and roof \- to the atmosphere, like electric current flowing through a network of resistors, at a rate controlled by wind patterns. In 2004, a novel wind tunnel modelling technique was used by Janet Barlow to investigate the impact of street width on heat transfer from each facet \[R1\]. This innovative data proved critical in validating a new street canyon resistance ‘network model’ devised by Reading PhD student Ian Harman \[R2\], supervised by Stephen Belcher and Met Office \(MO\) CASE Award co\-supervisor Martin Best, who had devised the ‘urban\-1tile’ scheme implemented in the MO Unified Model \(UM\) at the time. 

 Building materials store up heat in the daytime that is released slowly at night due to thermal inertia. Heat is also ‘trapped’ because walls and street radiate to each other. It is crucial to capture these physical characteristics to simulate urban heat islands. Further research by PDRA Aurore Porson \[R3\], under Belcher’s supervision, compared simplified versions of the network model with only one, two or three facets represented. When Porson evaluated against observations at an urban site, she obtained the best results, when compared to the four\-facet version, using two facets: roof, and merged street and walls. This was because the street\-wall facet has large thermal inertia, whilst the roof has a low value, and street and walls exchange heat through radiation. For streets of different widths, heights and building materials, the weighted combination of the two facets provides flexible parameter control for diurnal temperature range and rate of cooling, which the earlier urban\-1tile scheme was unable to achieve \(as it only has one facet\). 

 This was a critical finding that enabled the development of the MO Reading Urban Surface Exchange Scheme or MORUSES, which was a collaboration between University of Reading scientists and MO staff \(Peter Clark, Martin Best\) and is described fully in \[R4\]. The new scheme represents the urban area as a composition of two ‘tiles’ – roof, and merged street and walls – where a tile is the fraction of a weather forecast model grid\-box \(typically 1.5km square\) taken up by a single type of surface. When implemented in the UM and set up to mimic the urban\-1tile scheme, MORUSES produced results that were consistent with it physically which was an important sense\-check \[R4\]. However, MORUSES offers more flexibility than the urban\-1tile scheme in the representation of buildings. Heat stored in the MORUSES roof tile could be modelled in two different ways – using a thin roof or changing the material properties \[R5\]. When compared against observations of heat fluxes \(i.e., flows of heat between building surfaces and the air\), the MORUSES thin roof configuration gave a 33% reduction in error compared to the urban\-1tile scheme \[R5\]. Accurate simulation of heats fluxes leads to better temperature forecasts. 

 The ultimate test of the model was to simulate the UHI of a whole city. In 2011, PDRA Sylvia Bohnenstengel, under Belcher’s supervision, used MORUSES, implemented in the UM, to simulate London’s UHI at a model resolution of 1 km<sup>2</sup> as part of the EPSRC\-funded LUCID project \[R6\]. An important step was to derive input parameters for MORUSES – such as street width – from available data. Research was undertaken to relate a sophisticated but limited dataset detailing all of London’s buildings to a simpler but more freely available urban land\-use fraction dataset, already used in the UM. This parametrization is important as it underpins the application of MORUSES to all urban areas in the UK without needing high\-resolution building data. Simulated temperatures agreed well with LUCID observations at a range of sites across London. This would not have been possible with the urban\-1tile scheme, which lacks the capability to vary building shape and material properties in different neighbourhoods. This important improvement in physics representation allows much greater benefit to be obtained from running models at higher grid resolutions in urban areas. For instance, the modelled UHI showed subtle variation across the city in unprecedented detail and its relationship to local land use was studied to inform policies for climate adaptation \[R6\]. 

 In summary, Barlow et al. used novel wind tunnel experiments \[R1\] to evaluate a new model of heat fluxes and temperatures in street canyons \[R2\]. Further insight gained by the Reading researchers into the physical processes controlling the fluxes allowed a simpler version of the model to be developed \[R3\]. This allowed the Reading team to develop the MORUSES scheme \[R4\] which was able to match results from the existing MO scheme but demonstrated much more flexibility in representing different types of buildings \[R5\]. Simulations of London’s climate using MORUSES agreed well with measured data \[R6\] which paved the way for its use in MO operational weather forecasting and climate projections.

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  Met Office \(MO\) Operational Forecast Model 

 In March 2016, MORUSES was implemented in the MO’s regional UK operational weather forecast model, the UKV, run at 1.5 km resolution. This was as the result of evidence from two reports, the first of which involved evaluation of the UKV, including MORUSES, by a MO CASE student and MO Category C staff at Reading. They compared MORUSES with the University of Reading heat flux data in London that the MO does not routinely measure \[S1a\], and demonstrated that it produced a sensible heat flux \(i.e. the turbulent flow of heat from surface to atmosphere\) that was the right size and with a much more accurate daily pattern than its predecessor, the urban\-1tile scheme. This reduced errors in predicted urban temperatures and boundary layer depth, as detailed in a second Reading\-authored MO Report that extended the analysis for London \[S1b\]. MORUSES further proved its validity when it was trialled in the operational forecast and results were compared with standard MO observation sites across the UK. Even in rural areas, MORUSES improved the temperature forecast because of downwind transport of heat from larger conurbations, whereas the urban\-1tile scheme had made little impact \[S2\]. 

 Accurate forecasting of urban weather in different climate zones is important for international operational and research centres that partner with the MO to use and develop the UM \(the ‘UM Partnership’\). Together with the Meteorological Service of Singapore, the MO developed the SINGV numerical weather prediction model which became operational in 2019 \[S3a\]. The National Environment Agency of Singapore sponsored a 300m resolution study using SINGV incorporating MORUSES and using bespoke urban land use data which found a temperature *“bias … smaller than predicted by other Urban Canopy Parametrisations reported in the literature”* and *“that MORUSES is clearly able to represent the impacts of different neighbourhoods on the thermal environment”* \[S3b\]. MORUSES was proving valuable in improving temperature forecasts both in the UK and for an international city. Its good performance in a high\-resolution model \(300 m\) was especially promising. 

###  MO London model and research and innovation strategy 

 The MO set up a one third of a km resolution regional ‘London model’ \(LM\) in September 2013 to pioneer high\-resolution urban forecasts, initially aimed at improving forecasts of fog around Heathrow airport \[S4a\]. Run once daily, LM output is provided to complement the UKV forecast which does not have the resolution to capture small\-scale fog, which is very disruptive to flights and operations at Heathrow \[S4b\]. Early feedback from meteorologists based at Heathrow suggested that the LM tended to over\-forecast fog in urban areas. When MORUSES was tested in the LM and compared to the urban\-1tile scheme, it led to earlier warming in the morning and slightly later cooling in the evening. As fog evaporates when temperatures rise, this resulted in higher visibilities in urban regions and reduced the over\-prediction of fog as detailed in the MO Clean Air Report \[S4c\]. Since March 2019, MORUSES has been implemented in the LM, which is still run daily. 

 Improving urban forecasting is of increasing importance to the MO as it needs to provide weather and climate services down to the scale of neighbourhoods, requiring model resolutions approaching 100 m. This is reflected in the ‘Ready to resolve’ theme of the current MO Research and Innovation Strategy \(2019\-2024\), in which urban forecasting at high resolution is a key goal by 2030. To date, the MO has invested in the scientific development of MORUSES through time of seven members of University staff, as well as sponsorship of University of Reading higher\-degree students through four CASE Awards \[S5\]. MORUSES became operational in 2016 and proved its effectiveness at higher resolution in the LM. In 2019, the MO stated in their internally distributed MOSAC \(Meeting of the MO Scientific Advisory Committee\) paper that *“We wish to standardise this \[MORUSES\] to be the only urban\-S\(urface\)E\(nergy\)B\(alance\) scheme used within the Unified Model”* \[S6\]. Professor Simon Vosper, Director of Science at the MO affirms that *“MORUSES remains at the heart of our strategy to deliver high quality predictions of urban weather and climate”* \[S5\]. 

###  High\-resolution UKCP18 and UKCP local climate projections 

 Future heatwaves are projected to increase in intensity due to climate change. Urgent action is required to address overheating in buildings \(with its impact on people\) and to reduce the impact of urban heat islands – according to the  [2017 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/584281/uk-climate-change-risk-assess-2017.pdf). The previous climate projections produced by the MO Hadley Centre in 2009 were limited in model resolution \(25 km\) and provided only coarse information about urban temperature rise. The UK Climate Projections 2018 \(UKCP18\) give the most comprehensive picture yet of how the climate could change in the UK at 12 km resolution in the coming decades. UKCP18 gives *“governments, local authorities, land managers, national infrastructure bodies and other businesses an invaluable set of tools with which to assess the nature and scale of challenges and take decisions accordingly,”* says Michael Gove, then UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in a Speech on UK Climate Change Projections in 2018 \[S7a\]. In September 2019, for the first time internationally, projections were provided at a resolution of 2.2 km \(‘UKCP Local’\) which allows these important stakeholders to assess risk of future extreme weather events, not just climate trends. Because of its proven benefits in higher resolution models, MORUSES was included in UKCP Local, allowing meteorologists to discriminate between neighbourhoods with different building types \[S7b\]. This is critically important for local authorities who are using the local projections to plan for climate adaptation. 

 Bristol City Council, the first UK local authority to declare a climate emergency in November 2018, commissioned engineering consultants Arup to make a preliminary climate resilience assessment based on regional UKCP18 data at 12 km resolution, acknowledging that higher resolution data was not yet available at that time \[S8a\]. Ongoing at the time of writing, the MO is working directly with Bristol City Council *“on development of a tiered urban heat service. This uses the 2.2 km data, with future work to “link heat to a particular city vulnerability that Bristol are interested in”* \[S8b\]. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has *“asked the Met Office to issue a London version of the UKCP18 data…there are a few significant differences between 2018 and the 2009 projections that the London Environmental Strategy is based on. We … will … update our analysis if necessary”* \[S9\]. The Greater London Authority \(GLA\) has already made use of MORUSES data. Temperature data for London generated during the LUCID project for an extremely hot summer, 2006, are available through the GLA website \[S10a\] and were used by Arup in a project together with the GLA to identify urban heat risk \[S10b\]. Heat\-Health Watch alerts, example from August 2020  [here](https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/sites/default/files/file/adult-social-and-health-care/Heat-Health_Alert_12-08-20.pdf), based on regional temperature forecasts by the MO in association with Public Health England, are issued by the GLA to health professionals and emergency planners to manage heatwave periods. It now provides early warnings by region and London is given its own, recognising its unique urban heat island. In addition to the emerging impact of the UKCP Local dataset in tackling urban heat risk in the future, accurate, high\-resolution, urban heatwave forecasting is clearly needed now by a wide range of stakeholders. 

###  Summary 

 The complexity of urban surfaces makes forecasting temperatures in cities extremely challenging. Weather forecast models require representation of the microclimatic processes controlling temperature that are simple enough to implement and yet sophisticated enough to represent different urban neighbourhoods. Researchers at Reading produced and validated a model of how radiation and turbulence transfer heat from buildings in a simple ‘street canyon.’ Further collaborations led by the Reading team produced MORUSES; research measurements demonstrated its accuracy and, as a result, it has been used in the MO Unified Model since 2016 and in the London Model since 2019. MORUSES produced improvements in temperature forecasts across the UK and has improved performance in Singapore. The model is at the heart of MO strategy and capability in high resolution urban forecasting and climate projections. It allows the MO to develop much needed urban climate services for stakeholders such as local authorities who need climate projection data in unprecedented detail to protect neighbourhoods against future urban heat risk.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Oxford researchers have produced an efficacious vaccine to protect against SARS\-CoV\-2 infection. Oxford’s experience in vaccine development and clinical trial design, combined with the technological expertise of AstraZeneca, resulted in emergency use authorisation of ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19/AZD1222 vaccine in the UK and three other countries, by 31 December 2020. Over 11,000 participants in the Oxford COVID\-19 vaccine clinical trials from the UK, Brazil, and South Africa, and 20,000 in the US, received the ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 vaccine; these individuals now have 70% reduced risk of COVID\-19 and 100% reduction in risk of hospitalisation or death. Agreements were secured in 2020 for the supply of 2,678,900,000 vaccine doses on a not\-for\-profit basis worldwide, with half committed to LMICs. The underlying vaccine platform, ChAdOx1, has been licensed to companies worldwide and resulted in significant investment and business growth.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2012, Gilbert and Hill published the design and construction of a new replication\-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus\-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 \[1\]. Adenoviruses are potent vectors for inducing strong cellular immune responses and the use from 2004 in Hill’s lab at Oxford of various simian adenovirus avoided the widespread seroprevalence of neutralising antibodies to common human adenoviruses. Gilbert’s team developed a ChAdOx1 vaccine for the MERS coronavirus in 2017, showing good immune responses in mice, camels, rhesus macaques and humans \[2\], providing critical insight into the biology of immunity and potential of the vaccine technology to provide protection against coronavirus diseases. 

 In response to the SARS\-CoV\-2 coronavirus outbreak in December 2019, Gilbert’s team designed the novel coronavirus antigen to add to ChAdOx1 on 11 January 2020, as soon as the genetic code of SARS\-CoV\-2 was released. The genetic sequence of the spike protein of SARS\-CoV\-2, the surface glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding, fusion, and entry into the host cell, was codon\-optimised and cloned into the ChAdOx1 vaccine. Together with Lambe, Gilbert produced the Oxford COVID\-19 vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19, in their Oxford laboratory. The initial doses were used to test immune responses in rhesus macaques at Porton Down, Public Health England \(PHE\), UK and Rocky Mountain Laboratories, USA where the team showed that ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 vaccine produced a strong immune response and prevented the development of pneumonia in rhesus macaques \[3\]. Gilbert and Green initiated and optimised good manufacturing practice \(GMP\) production of ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 in the Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility at the University of Oxford with Lambe and Douglas and Hill in preparation for Phase I human trials. 

 Pollard led the design and implementation of the Oxford COVID\-19 vaccine clinical trials, at unprecedented speed and scale nationally and internationally. In parallel with animal studies \[3\], Pollard initiated a phase I/II clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19. Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, COV001 enrolled 1,077 participants between 18 and 55 years of age across five sites in the UK, including Oxford. By then Hill had identified key vaccine manufacturers, major industrial partners, and licensees. Volunteers were assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 \(n=543\) or meningococcal conjugate vaccine, MenACWY \(n=534\). The Phase I/II trial showed no safety concerns and demonstrated that ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 induced both humoral and cellular immune responses in participants with neutralising antibody responses strongest after a booster dose \[4\]. The results supported large scale evaluation in Phase III trials. Immunogenicity to vaccines is often lower in older people. As older people are much more likely to suffer from severe COVID\-19, a vaccine that protects this age group was crucial. Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, COV002 enrolled 560 participants across two sites in the UK \(Oxford and Southampton\), including 400 participants over the age of 55. The results showed that older people, including those over 70, produced a good immune response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 vaccine and the vaccine was well tolerated across all ages groups \[5\]. 

 Phase III trials were initiated in June 2020 across 19 sites in the UK, 6 sites in Brazil, 7 sites in South Africa \(and an additional Phase I trial at 1 site in Kenya\). Expansion of the clinical trials around the UK and to other countries increased the diversity of ethnicity and global generalisability of the results and provided a higher likelihood of catching a wave of disease and accelerating efficacy results. Interim analysis of the safety and efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 vaccine against SARS\-CoV\-2, from clinical trials in the UK \(COV001, COV002\), Brazil \(COV003, phase III\) and South Africa \(COV005, phase I/II\), was published in December 2020 \[6\]. The safety of the vaccine was assessed using all four trials and was shown to be acceptable with no hospital admissions or severe cases reported in the ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 arm. Interim efficacy of the vaccine was assessed using a global pooled analysis combining data from COV002 and COV003. Between April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23,848 participants were enrolled and 11,636 participants \(7,548 in the UK, 4,088 in Brazil\) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. Overall vaccine efficacy was 70·4% \[6\]. Additionally, Oxford research showed that a longer interval between the first and second vaccine dose promoted a stronger immune response \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Oxford vaccine technology underpins therapeutic and preventative applications 

 ChAdOx1 was patented in 2012 \(PCT/GB2012/000467\) and has been used in 11 vaccine programmes, including for malaria, influenza, Chikungunya, and MERS, showing a good safety profile and high immunogenicity. Recognising the potential for vaccine development using ChAdOx1, Gilbert and Hill founded Vaccitech in January 2016 to develop vaccine and T cell therapeutic products to improve global health. Vaccitech was spun out from the University of Oxford, and licensed intellectual property rights to the ChAdOx1 technology \[1\], raising GBP10,000,000 investment from Oxford Sciences Innovation \(OSI\) \[A\]. Vaccitech has subsequently attracted additional investment of GBP57,000,000 between Nov 2017 and Dec 2020 enabling programme development \[A\]. Vaccitech has grown from 1 employee in May 2017 to almost 50 employees in Dec 2020 \[A\], contributing to business development in the local area and has subsidiaries in Australia and the US to support global operations \[A\]. HAV Vaccines in London licensed ChAdOx technology from Oxford University Innovation \(OUI\) to develop a vaccine to treat and prevent infection by *Mycobacterium avium* subspecies *paratuberculosis* \(MAP\) which is responsible for the chronic gut inflammation in patients with Crohn’s Disease. A phase 1 study on healthy volunteers \[Bi\] showed no safety concerns and patients with Crohn’s Disease are being recruited into a follow\-on phase 1 trial \[Bii\]. Aelix Therapeutics in Spain has also licensed the ChAdOx technology from OUI and is using the technology to develop a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of HIV. Aelix Therapeutics launched a phase 1, randomised, double\-blind, placebo\-controlled safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity clinical trial in 45 individuals with HIV in July 2017 \[C\]. 

####  The Oxford\-AstraZeneca COVID\-19 vaccine \(ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19/AZD1222\) 

#####  Protecting people over four continents against COVID\-19 through vaccination 

 Between 23 April and 4 November 2020, Oxford led clinical trials in geographically and ethnically diverse populations over three continents. 11,636 individuals were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 in clinical trials in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa. Based on interim efficacy results \[6\], these individuals now have a 70.4% reduced risk of developing COVID\-19 and vaccinated individuals are protected against hospitalisation with COVID\-19. In August 2020, AstraZeneca began a Phase III clinical trial in the US to determine the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 \[D\], enrolling 32,449 participants, with two thirds receiving the COVID\-19 vaccine and one third the placebo.  Data from the US trial showed that the vaccine reduced risk of severe COVID\-19 by 100%, of clinical COVID\-19 by 76% and was 85% effective in older adults. 

#####  Informing regulators and UK vaccination dosing regimen 

 On 30 December 2020, following review of the Oxford clinical trial data by the Commission on Human Medicines, ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19/AZD1222 was authorised for emergency use supply in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) \[E\], the first viral vectored vaccine against COVID\-19 to be granted approval in Europe. Oxford research \[6\] was used to inform the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI\) decision on dosing regimen for the Oxford vaccine, and for the Pfizer\-BioNTech mRNA vaccine that had received regulatory approval in the UK on 2 December 2020 and whose clinical trial data used a three\-week dosing interval. Oxford research \[6\] showed that a longer interval between the first and second vaccine dose promoted a stronger immune response. On 31 December 2020, the JCVI recommended a two\-dose schedule for the Pfizer\-BioNTech and Oxford\-AZ vaccines, with a maximal interval of 12 weeks between the first and second dose for both vaccines, based on the likelihood that immune responses to both vaccines were similar \[F\]. The Committee recommended prioritising delivery of the first vaccine dose as this was highly likely to have a greater public health impact, allowing more people to be vaccinated, and reduce the number of preventable deaths from COVID\-19 \[F\]. Emergency use authorisation of ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19/AZD1222 was granted in Argentina and El Salvador on 30 December 2020, and in Dominican Republic on 31 December 2020. 

#####  Securing access to vaccines for the UK population 

 The UK, through the UK Vaccine Taskforce \(VTF\), was the first country in the world to secure access to the Oxford vaccine, securing 100,000,000 doses \(enough for 50,000,000 people\) in May 2020, 7 months before the vaccine received regulatory approval. The former Chair of the VTF wrote that, 

 “*The portfolio of Oxford’s research on ChAdOx viral vectored vaccines was a critical factor for the VTF’s decision to secure 100 million doses of the Oxford/AZ vaccine before it had received regulatory approval*” \[G\]. 

 Guaranteeing doses of the Oxford vaccine helped the UK government meet its goal of securing access to COVID\-19 vaccines for the UK population as quickly as possible \[G\]. 

####  Global partnership for worldwide distribution of ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19 

 On 30 April 2020, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca signed a landmark agreement for the global development, manufacture, and distribution of ChAdOx1 nCoV\-19/AZD1222 \[Hi\]. Of crucial importance to the Oxford/AstraZeneca partnership was the joint commitment to ensure broad and equitable access to the vaccine on a not\-for\-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic and in perpetuity to low and middle income countries \(LMICs\) \[Hii\]. In June 2020, AstraZeneca was the first global pharmaceutical company to join COVAX \(COVID\-19 Vaccines Global Access\), a global initiative led by CEPI, GAVI and WHO, aiming to distribute 2 billion vaccine doses to 92 LMICs at no more than USD3 per dose. As of 31 December 2020, agreements were in place for the supply of 2,678,900,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine worldwide \[I\], almost twice as many as any other vaccine developer globally, and notably with approximately half committed to LMICs via COVAX \[J\]. The Oxford vaccine has the significant benefit of being easy to manufacture, store in a fridge and distribute, allowing it to be rapidly deployed in LMICs. 

 AstraZeneca confirmed, 

 “*The ChAdOx platform was particularly attractive for us as it enabled the rapid development and deployment of novel vaccines with a manufacturing process and supply chain that would enable the equitable and global rollout we all envisaged, without some of the limitations of mRNA vaccines*” \[K\]. 

 Alongside expanding manufacturing capacity at AstraZeneca, the collaboration with Oxford also resulted in growth of 

 “*a significant preclinical, clinical capability to support the vaccine programme. This now provides the platform for next generation vaccine development, not just for SARS CoV\-2 but potentially for other important viral infections*"" \[K\]. 

####  Driving UK vaccine development capabilities 

 The former Chair of the VTF said “ *The development of the Oxford vaccine helped drive the growth of the UK’s vaccine capability*” \[G\]. In May 2020, the UK government announced GBP131,000,000 investment to accelerate construction of the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre \(VMIC\) at Harwell, Oxfordshire, and to create a virtual VMIC which could produce vaccine doses whilst VMIC was under construction \[Li\]. As of 31 December 2020, three of the seven most advanced COVID\-19 vaccines were being manufactured in the UK, including the Oxford vaccine \[Lii\]. 

 The former Chair of the VTF stated, 

 “*The development of the Oxford vaccine has stimulated new investment in skills and training and dramatically expanded the UK’s capacity to manufacture and fill vials across a range of bioprocessing and fill finish companies throughout the UK*” \[G\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In the sixteenth century, Scots was the dominant language of Scotland. Despite centuries of Anglicisation, aided by education policy, over 1,500,000 speakers remain, many in North\-East Scotland. University of Aberdeen research, developed from methodological engagement with local communities, has focused on the North\-East dialect \(Doric\), its history, nature and the restoration of its centrality to the region. The research has influenced the development of education, both formal and cultural, on and in Doric; influenced decision\-making on language at regional and national levels; and inspired documentary film production, which promotes and celebrates Doric producing commentary across traditional and digital media. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Modern Age has not been kind to languages whose speakers do not have immediate access to economic, social and political power. Scots, one of the native vernaculars of Scotland and in the Early Modern period the dominant language of the country, has been essentially *dialectalised* under Standard English, but continues to have considerable speaker numbers. In the North\-East of Scotland, almost 160,000 speakers of Scots were recorded, according to the 2011 census, from a population of a little under 350,000. But even here, generations of, at best, official neglect have led to even ‘good’ native speakers evincing prejudice against their own language, often choosing not to pass this heritage on to their children. 

 The research carried out by Robert McColl Millar has helped to analyse and illustrate the dialects of the North\-East as a whole, employing theory and methodology derived from dialectology, sociolinguistics and historical linguistics. His first study represented a major survey of everyday use of Scots, particularly in dialects local to the North of Scotland, informed by interactions with local communities and an historical appreciation of change and language retention in the dialect area \[1\]. Not only did the survey provide a modern and comprehensive mapping of the various dialects in use north of the River Tay, it also signalled a change to the traditional methodology used to study Doric \(the local name for the Scots dialect of North\-East Scotland\), which had previously focused on abstract phonological issues, or the literature of the region, rather than on how it was actually used within everyday situations. 

 This work helped Millar attract significant AHRC funding, enabling extensive fieldwork to be carried out in coastal communities around Scotland’s North\-East, on the retention and attrition of local vocabulary \[P1; 2\]. This research provided, for the first time in nearly a century, a clear picture of language use in those areas, accessible to interested laypeople while at the same time increasing our understanding of how lexical variation and change occurs. 

 The methodologies developed in both of these projects were then employed in relation to the Scots dialects spoken across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The approach included a linguistic overview of the key regional varieties of the language \[3\]. The resulting work provided the first detailed analysis of all Scots varieties. But the focus of much of this work is primarily on those areas where Scots is a major part of community life. This is most markedly true with Doric and the North\-East.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Millar’s research has informed the development of educational materials, from pre\-school to university; enhanced knowledge and understanding of Scots within local communities; influenced decision\-making in relation to the recognition of Scots as a language to be supported; and inspired the creation of documentaries promoting and celebrating Scots. 

 **Informing the development of educational materials, from pre\-school to university courses** 

 Banff Academy, aided by the Elphinstone Institute, the University of Aberdeen’s local cultural and linguistic promotion unit, have used Millar’s research to develop Scots materials for secondary school. The school was felt appropriate for the experiment because Doric remains the primary community spoken variety. The teacher central to these changes, Jamie Fairbairn, remarks that *Modern Scots* \[3\] is essential for teaching; Millar’s talks and the documentary discussed below enhance his understanding of local language \[S1\]. *Modern Scots* informed a touring exhibition, ‘Fair Trickit’, created by Banff teachers and pupils, which showcased their Doric knowledge and use. Around 800 people across Scotland viewed the exhibition in autumn 2019 \[S7\]. The Elphinstone Institute’s *Scots Language Pathway* \(2018\-; supported by a British Educational Research Association GBP10,000 grant\) was strongly influenced by these developments. Trialled in four schools, these plans are available for general use; its site has had 1040 visitors. 

 Millar’s work underlay a workshop on Doric for secondary schoolchildren in Forres \(2019\), organised by Moray Council and the Elphinstone Institute. It brought together experts on the language with children from a Doric heartland, foregrounding something central to their lives \[S3\]. 

 Educational influence is apparent beyond the North\-East. Education Scotland’s Scots Language Co\-ordinator, Bruce Eunson, commented: ‘ *Modern Scots* … \[is\] a key text for anyone working with, or interested in, the Scots language today’ \[S6\]. Eunson used that book in a Level 1 Scots Language and Culture course for the Open University \(2019\-\). In 2020, 78 students completed the course; over 10,000 people visited the site, with Eunson noting that ‘The course has generated huge interest and has been one of the most\-visited courses on the OpenLearn Create platform to date\!’ \[S6\]. 

 **Enhancing the knowledge and understanding of Scots within local communities** 

 Learning support went well beyond formal teaching. Using *Modern Scots* \[3\], the Elphinstone Institute established an evening class, delivered first in 2019 \(45 participants\), improving confidence in reading and writing Doric. The *Doric Dabblers* \(2019\-\), a smaller group from across the region, produce educational materials for younger children, informed by \[3\] and the Elphinstone Institute materials. Central to these initiatives was Jackie Ross, who also led a Doric course in Huntly \(2019\) \[S4\], encouraging active use.  A Turkish participant wrote: ‘Thank ye fer keeping the language alive’ \[S5\]. 

 The Elphinstone Institute’s Hame—Home—Dom project \(2018\-\), informed by Millar’s work, introduces newcomers to local language and culture. Its online Doric course has proved attractive for people around the world \(often of North\-East parentage\), providing confidence in language use \[S8\]. 

 **Influencing decision making regarding support for the Scots Language** 

 Millar was appointed academic advisor to the North\-East Scots Language Board, established in 2018 and bringing together local authorities’ staff responsible for cultural matters and community representatives to develop policy for maintaining and promoting Doric. Drawing on Millar’s expertise, the Board influenced the implementation of Aberdeenshire Council’s Doric Language Policy \(2017, \[S2\]\). This connection inspired council support for the documentary *North\-East Scots* \(2019\), discussed below, along with the policy’s use in schools and libraries. The Board’s importance can also be seen in the employment of Doric by the NHS, including its use in recorded spoken instructions given to patients inside MRI scanners in local hospitals. 

 Nationally, Millar’s research has informed growing support for the establishment of a Scots Language Board and a new Scots Language Policy, both under consideration by the Scottish Government. At Westminster, MPs called for action to safeguard Scots in broadcasting and education \(13 May 2020\) \[S9\]. The motion references *Rebel Tongue*, discussed below. Finally, Millar’s research underpinned a European Parliament briefing document on Scots \(published 13 August 2019\) \[S9\]. 

 **Inspiring the creation of TV and documentary productions promoting Scots** 

 Millar’s research has inspired several creative outputs. He features prominently in *North\-East Scots – The Doric Language* \(a film developed by the Elphinstone Institute, 2019\), employed in schools and by community groups. The documentary was supported by Aberdeenshire Council \(GBP5,000\). It has been viewed over 63,000 times online, liked 427 and shared 546 times. It was premiered, with a panel discussion, at the University of Aberdeen’s MayFest \(2019\) to an audience of around 100 \[S10\]. 

 Millar’s research also inspired *Rebel Tongue* \(a documentary produced by, and aired on, BBC Scotland, 2020\), presenting the history and present use of Scots \[S10\]. It was commissioned by the channel because of general interest in the subject matter in Scotland and the UK’s obligation to support and promote Scots following its adoption of the Council of Europe’s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages \(2001\).

#  2. Underpinning research 

 There is a major public health crisis in relation to children and young people’s \(CYP\) wellbeing, fuelled by rising prevalence of mental health difficulties \(NHS Digital, 2018\) and service cuts \(House of Commons Health Committee, 2014\). Amid this crisis, the ‘front line’ role of the education system has taken on increasing importance \(House of Commons Education and Health Committees, 2017\). More specifically, schools and colleges can \(i\) create a nurturing environment where CYP feel safe and happy; \(ii\) identify and monitor mental health needs among CYP; \(iii\) provide support for mental health needs; and \(iv\) refer to and/or deliver specialist provision \(NatCen/NCB, 2017\). However, the status quo is one of unfulfilled potential. For example, only 15% of schools make use of universal screening approaches \(NatCen/NCB, 2017\), and two\-thirds do not use research evidence to inform their decision\-making in relation to mental health provision \(Vostanis et al. 2013. *Child and Adolescent Mental Health* 18\(3\): 151\-157\). 

 The underpinning programme of research for this case study speaks directly to these four critical functions: 

 **1. Identifying effective, evidence\-based social and emotional learning practices for teachers and schools** \[1\] 

 Our comprehensive, systematic analysis of 33 reviews and meta\-analyses identified the 13 best validated universal social and emotional learning interventions, from which key strategies and practices were drawn. For example, in terms of self\-management, *effective interventions were found to commonly teach children self\-calming strategies, positive self\-talk, and recognition of body cues to help them manage their behaviour and control impulses, alongside using images and metaphors to develop their understanding* – **Key Finding 1**. 

 **2. Assessing and monitoring mental health in school settings** \[2,3\] 

 We developed, piloted, and rolled out the Wellbeing Measurement Framework \(mental health and wellbeing, emotional strengths and skills, support networks, risk factors\) in three studies involving nearly 300 schools and >100,000 CYP across 68 Local Authorities in England. Data from these studies enabled us to *establish prevalence estimates in high need areas; establish the psychometric properties of measures;* and *, improve understanding of the determinants of mental health in CYP* – **Key Finding 2**. 

 **3. Utility of school\-based universal screening for mental health needs** \[4\] 

 Our extensive review of the literature rigorously demonstrated that school\-based universal screening can help schools to identify CYP with emergent mental health needs. In particular, *alternative methods such as simple nomination and screening for the presence/absence of protective factors may be just as useful as traditional approaches \(wherein CYP or proxy informants complete mental health measures\)* – **Key Finding 3** 

 **4. Summative evaluation of targeted interventions** \[5,6\] 

 Our research has shown the impact of a range of school\-based targeted mental health interventions in Newham \(e.g. Team Social Action, Bounce Back, More Than Mentors\). For example, our randomised trial of BounceBack *demonstrated its efficacy in reducing children’s emotional symptoms; furthermore, the magnitude of this effect was larger among moderate \(those attending >70% intervention sessions\) and high \(>80%\) compliers* \- **Key Finding 5**. In another study, our randomised trial of Team Social Action demonstrated *no main intervention effect on at\-risk adolescents’ wellbeing, peer support or school connectedness; however, analysis did reveal positive effects on wellbeing and peer support among ‘high compliers’ \(those attending >80% of intervention sessions\)* – **Key Finding 6**.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research sought to address the aforementioned public health crisis by influencing how schools create a nurturing environment for CYP, identify and monitor mental health needs, provide support for mental health needs, and refer to and/or deliver specialist provision. 

#  1. Increased use of evidence\-informed social and emotional learning practices in primary school classrooms 

 Key Finding 1 resulted in the production of a guidance document published by the Education Endowment Foundation, the government’s What Works Centre for Education, in 2019 \[A\]. This has been downloaded 11,526 times from 13 countries \(as at 31/12/20\), and has improved the practice of teachers via their adoption of evidence\-based strategies to promote social and emotional learning \(SEL\), which in turn fosters positive experiences and outcomes for CYP. Following continuing professional development events in Manchester and York used to showcase the guidance after its launch, 91% of participating teachers agreed that their understanding and knowledge of SEL had improved, 100% agreed that they had new or improved ideas and strategies for teaching SEL explicitly, 98% reported gaining useful knowledge in choosing whether to adopt an SEL programme, 100% reported having new ideas to take back to their school, and 100% agreed that their pupils would benefit from our recommendations \[B\]. For example, in line with the guidance on developing emotional vocabulary and problem\-solving strategies, each class in one school now has a ‘feelings wall’ where pupils place their names on the emotions they are experiencing, which are then matched to corresponding support strategies associated with that feeling \[C\]. In addition, Year 5 and 6 pupils have been trained as wellbeing ambassadors, to talk positively to their peers about their struggles, anxiety and worries. “ *This allows children to talk more openly about how they are feeling and reduces the stigma associated with doing so*” \[C\]. Following the guidance on emotional management, the school has also implemented ‘calm\-boxes’ that include resources to help children self\-regulate \[C\]. 

#  2. Introduction of systematic assessment and monitoring of mental health and resilience of pupil populations via the Wellbeing Measurement Framework, and use of data gathered to inform provision 

 Nearly 300 schools in 68 Local Authorities \(20% of all LAs in England\) have implemented the Wellbeing Measurement Framework \(WMF\) to systematically assess and monitor the mental health of >100,000 pupils. All schools receive a comprehensive, bespoke aggregated report via our online portal, which allows them to interrogate patterns and trends that can inform their future provision. These interactive functions derive directly from Key Finding 2. For example, common risk factors identified in said research \(e.g. special educational needs\) are available as filters, such that schools can monitor levels of need among target groups: “ *The WMF allows us to routinely assess and monitor mental health/wellbeing and related aspects of young people’s lives via a single survey platform. It overcomes a downfall of our previous approach, in which we were using many different measures that were all administrated variably and then reported on and interpreted differently*” \[D\]. Data is also presented longitudinally to facilitate analysis of trends over time, thereby enabling evaluation of the impact of different aspects of mental health provision in a given school \[D\]. Specific examples of impact include: 

-  Introduction of WMF measures as Key Performance Indicators in Cornwall Council’s Business Plan, with targeted funding made available to schools to support areas of identified need \[E\] 

-  Raised staff awareness of pupil mental health issues and planning of interventions \[D\] 

-  Use of WMF to provide independent evidence for Ofsted relating to pupil wellbeing \[F,G\] 

-  Integration of WMF with police, LA and NHS Foundation Trust data to provide a comprehensive assessment of community needs in order to inform a population\-wide approach to resource allocation \[G\] 

#  3. Introduction of universal screening and use of data to inform referral for support 

 Key Finding 3 resulted in the introduction of universal screening in Newham and Blackpool, two local authorities with extremely high levels of underpinning need \(e.g. Blackpool is ranked as the most deprived authority in England; Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government, 2019\). This has taken place in Years 5\-10 in 39 primary and 13 secondary schools across Newham \[H\] \(serving an annual pupil population of >20,600 since 2016\) and in Year 5 in 32 primary schools across Blackpool \[G\] \(serving an annual pupil population of >1,500 since 2017\). Data generated via screening are used to inform referral to specialist/targeted interventions. Ultimately, this means that CYP with emergent mental health difficulties in these areas are identified earlier and given the support they need, and school staff and allied professionals are able to provide improved continuity of care \[G,H\]. In Newham, >4,700 referrals have been made following screening, with >2,700 CYP subsequently provided with targeted/specialist support \[H\]. In Blackpool, >500 CYP have been identified as requiring additional support following screening, and have subsequently been provided with targeted intervention or referred to specialist services \[G\]. 

 Our research on identification and risk factors was showcased in workshops, which led to further discussions with staff in the two Local Authorities. Newham used our review \(Key Finding 3\) which, *“supported us to consider different approaches to identifying our target population resulting in us choosing a simple nomination approach”* a method that, *“enables the appropriate use of the resources available, enabling the young people in need of support to access the right interventions, at the right level”* \[H\]. Blackpool chose to screen for the cumulative presence/absence of sources of resilience, a decision based directly on Key Findings 2 and 3, which were, *“instrumental in supporting us in developing the student resilience survey as an identification method. This is now embedded as a population tool for all young people in Year 5 and enables us to ensure we are providing opportunities for young people to benefit from the most appropriate activity”* \[G\]. 

#  4. Making evidence\-based decisions about school\-based targeted mental health interventions 

 Key Findings 5 and 6 led directly to key decisions to adapt and maintain school\-based targeted mental health interventions in Newham. For example, Bounce Back has been maintained and has been delivered with nearly 1200 CYP with emergent mental health difficulties to date \[I\]; our RCT evidence indicates that they will have experienced reduced emotional symptoms as a result. Efforts to improve engagement and attendance include behaviour management training for youth practitioners and are directly based on our finding of increased intervention effect sizes among children who attended more sessions \(Key Finding 5\) \[I\]. Similarly, the Team Social Action service plan was adapted to include closer monitoring of attendance and changing the timing of intervention sessions in order to maximise CYP’s participation; these changes were implemented because our research rigorously demonstrated positive effects on wellbeing and peer support when session attendance was >80% \(Key Finding 6\) \[I\]. Team Social Action has also been maintained, and nearly 700 at\-risk adolescents have participated to date. Collectively, our summative evaluations have been a key instrument for Newham in determining what works in promoting mental health among their most vulnerable CYP, enabling them to base decisions about future implementation on high quality independent evidence as opposed to anecdotal feedback \[I\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Since 2001, Professor Jo Silvester’s unique programme of applied psychology research has directly impacted professional standards and training in UK political contexts and inspired changes in Parliament’s working culture. The selection and assessment processes she designed for the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats have been used to approve nearly 400 parliamentary candidates in four general elections and increase gender diversity. Around 30,000 local Councillors in England and Wales elected since 2013 have benefitted from the Political Skills Framework created by Silvester. New since REF2014, Silvester’s research influenced the reform of governance structures in the House of Commons. She designed the culture change programme and identified shared values that were incorporated into the House Service Strategy 2016\-20.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Millions of elected members and officials work in local and national governments worldwide. To date, however, psychologists have paid very little attention to the knowledge and skills elected members need to perform their roles and to deliver strong political leadership, nor to the unique challenges faced by those whose work within legislatures supports and enables strong democracy and good governance. This case study reports continuing impact from Professor Silvester’s REF 2014 case study regarding the approval of prospective parliamentary candidates by political parties and leadership development for elected members, as well as new impact resulting from later research in the House of Commons \(HOC\) on leadership in a legislature. 

 **Research submitted to REF 2014** 

 Silvester’s research, aimed at improving the selection, development and performance of British politicians began in 2001. This research was the first to apply psychology research on employee selection and diversity to the work of politicians. Initial research with the Conservative Party involved three stages: \(1\) interviews/focus groups with party stakeholders to agree competencies and behavioural indicators, \(2\) design and implementation of a new multi\-trait, multi\-method assessment centre for assessing and approving prospective parliamentary candidates, and \(3\) a longitudinal evaluation to monitor diversity and candidates’ performance in the 2005 general election. The research found equivalent male and female performance across all exercises and competences, refuting assumptions at the time that women’s political style is less effective than men’s, and showed that psychological characteristics are important for electoral performance \[3.1\]. This resulted in her developing assessment standards and procedures for prospective parliamentary candidates for both the Conservative Party \(2002\) and Liberal Democrat Party \(2008\) \[3.1, 3.2\]. 

 To support the next stage of this work, Silvester received funding in 2008 and 2009 from the ESRC, Home Office, and IDeA \(now Local Government Association; LGA\) to investigate political mentoring and leadership development in local government. The LGA is the national membership body for the 339 local authorities in England and Wales working to improve the reputation and performance of local councils. The research conceptualised politicians as political workers and used a multisource Political Performance Questionnaire, developed following a qualitative competency analysis, eliciting behavioural indicators for good and poor political performance. 

 The empirical stage investigated shared latent performance constructs and tested hypothesised relationships between politician characteristics and received performance ratings. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of self\- and received performance ratings revealed five latent factors: resilience, politicking, analytical skills, representing people, and relating to others \[3.3, 3.4\]. These results further validated the  [Political Skills Framework](https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/read-revised-version-poli-243.pdf) created by Silvester, published as a toolkit in 2013, which set out core skills for local councillors in England and Wales. 

 **Post\-2014 Research** 

 The earlier research led Silvester to identify political work as an important, yet neglected phenomenon, intersecting psychology, management and political science. In July 2014 she hosted a one\-day event at City, University of London \(City\) for eighty leading international academics, politicians \(including the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke\), and practitioners from organisations such as the Industry and Parliament Trust \(IPT\) and Operation Black Vote, to develop a broader understanding of the complex challenges of political work. Three themes emerged from the event, focused on political leadership, relating to performance, integrity, and more representative government \[3.5\]. 

  

 MPs are supported in their parliamentary responsibilities by nearly 1,700 people, collectively known as House Staff, employed within departments of the House Service.  As a direct result of the earlier event, Silvester was invited by the HOC and the Industry and Parliament Trust \(IPT\) to deliver a programme of MBA\-style development sessions for senior House Staff. With Professor André Spicer, she designed a programme over six sessions, delivered with ten academics from City. Topics included leadership, organisational identity, industrial relations, resource management, collaboration working, and business sustainability. 

 The timing of these sessions \(September 2014\) was significant as the newly formed HOC Governance Committee was to undertake a review of governance. Silvester was asked to undertake a short investigation to understand existing working practices and propose recommendations for change. Working with Spicer, she conducted interviews with current and former senior House Staff and MPs. Their report found that the House Service operates in a plural and complex environment and made recommendations relating to governance, leadership, strategy, collaboration, culture, communication, change, and learning. Silvester and Spicer suggested that importing models of leadership from public or private sector organisations with relatively unitary goals would likely be problematic. The findings were submitted as written evidence to the Governance Committee’s review and some recommendations were adopted by the Committee \[3.6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This section describes continuing and extended impact of the political selection research reported in REF2014 \(4.1, 4.2\) and reports new impact from the post\-2014 research investigating leadership in a legislature \(4.3\). Figure 1 below shows the impacts and timelines. 



 **Figure 1** Continuing impact and new impact during REF2014 and REF2021 

 **4.1 Political Candidate Selection: Continuing and extended impact since REF2014** 

 Silvester’s research\-based assessment criteria and procedures have been used by the Conservative Party since 2002 \[5.1\] and the Liberal Democrats since 2009 \[5.2\] to approve approximately 400 candidates subsequently elected as first\-time MPs in four general elections 2003\-2017. Since 2012, the Liberal Democrats have extended use of the selection process to candidates for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, European Parliament, and major local government roles \(i.e. City Mayors, Crime Commissioners\) \[5.2\]. 

 Regarding gender diversity, since Silvester’s competencies and assessment process were introduced in 2002 as part of the Conservative Party’s standard approval process for prospective parliamentary candidates, the number of Conservative women candidates has increased, with women MPs increasing from 8% to 24% between 2005 and 2019 \[5.1\]. Her work has influenced other researchers and, indirectly, HOC procedures, being cited in Professor Sarah Childs’ 2016 report \[5.3\], which made recommendations for a more representative and inclusive HOC. Childs’ report has been referenced in over 30 debates in both houses of Parliament \[5.4\] and influenced Dame Laura Cox’s 2018 report into bullying in the HOC. In 2020, MPs voted for an independent panel to deal with bullying and harassment allegations against them. 

 Silvester’s political selection research is starting to have international impact too. Since 1999, there have been frequent elections in post\-conflict Kosovo and, in 2019, Silvester was commissioned by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy \(WFD\), the UK government body supporting democracy internationally, to write a report and deliver a workshop on ‘Political Selection’ for Kosovan political parties. Since then, the WFD Country Representative for Kosovo reports that in 2020 two of the main parties developed proposals to put in place Candidate Selection Processes. First, the Democratic Party of Kosovo relating to women candidates, then the current largest party, Vetevendosje \[Self\-Determination\], *“asked WFD to initiate a support project to introduce the Candidate Selection Process within their political party”* \[5.5\]. 

 **4.2 Political Development, Local Government: Continuing impact since REF 2014** 

 Selection and development go hand\-in\-hand in most places of work, yet until 2004 development for the 20,000 councillors in England and Wales was limited, with little evidence to support training needs analysis and design appropriate interventions. Silvester’s Political Skills Framework identified six core skills: leadership, partnership working, communications, scrutiny and challenge, regulation and monitoring, and political understanding. Adopted by most of the 300\+ local authorities and re\-published twice as the Political Skills Toolkit, it is now integrated into the Local Government Association’s sector\-led Leadership Development Programme and revised  [Member Charter](https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/member-development-charte-237.pdf) \(2016; Element 2.2\). Local election cycles since 2013 involved around 30,000 seats and the LGA’s Head of Improvement writes: 

 *“\[Silvester’s\] work was particularly important, as many newly elected local councillors have little or no experience of working in politics”* and confirms it *“continues to underpin leadership, training and development work”* \[5.6\]. 

 Since REF 2014, Silvester’s political skills framework has also been used to address catastrophic failures in local governance. In 2015, following recommendations of the Parliamentary Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation, all elected members on Rotherham Metropolitan Council received a bespoke development programme and training needs analysis based on Silvester’s framework \[5.6\]. 

 **4.3 Political Work in the House of Commons: Post\-2014 research and impact** 

 Since 2014, Professor Silvester’s research on leadership in legislatures has achieved new impact by improving governance structures in the HOC and facilitating a unified House culture through their influence on the House Service Strategy.  The House of Commons Governance Committee Report published in December 2014 \[5.7\] cited Silvester and Spicer’s evidence three times \(pp.11, 33, 34\) and echoed their recommendations for more clarity around roles, an improved culture of stewardship, and more open and honest communication across the House Service. The evidence also contributed to a recommendation that *“structural changes will need to be underpinned by cultural change”* \(p.63\). In January 2015, the Report was debated and agreed unanimously in the HOC Chamber, with the Management Board tasked with achieving culture change. 

 As a consequence of their research evidence, and building on the success of the MBA sessions, the HOC’s Director of People Development invited Silvester and Spicer to run a two\-day event for senior leaders from the House Service \(April 2015\), focussed on increasing awareness of organisational culture and leading people through culture change. Building on organisational psychology research, Silvester led activities designed to elicit leaders’ perceptions and descriptors of the existing culture, generate behavioural indicators, and identify whether values were shared. These findings were shared at a meeting of all senior leaders, and discussed at the  [HOC Management Board](https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-chief-executive/MBPapers/2015-05-14_Strategy_2015-20_Parliament.pdf) in May 2015 \[5.8, pp. 5\-7\). 

 Silvester and Spicer were then invited to collaborate with the HOC People and Strategy Group in designing and delivering a change programme for House Staff aimed at identifying and agreeing shared core values for a new unified House culture. The ‘Join the Conversation’ programme was attended by over 200 staff from all areas of the House Service and twenty MPs, Management Board members, and senior House Staff were interviewed. 

 Silvester synthesised the information to develop a new values framework and behavioural indicators \[5.9\].

 *“… received a positive response from staff, due to an inclusive process of consultation and engagement which we believe is vital to build ownership of the revised and elaborated values. \[The\] Executive Committee has a vital role to play in framing, endorsing and subsequently role modelling the values …”* \[5.9\]. 

 The core values were published internally in November 2015, and departments and individuals were encouraged to apply them in business plans, performance reviews and day\-to\-day work. The values – for example, ‘customer focus’ – continue to underpin the 2016\-21 House Service Strategy \[5.10, p.11\] and will be taken forward into the 2019\-2025 Strategy.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Now, more than ever, the ability of organisations to anticipate, prepare for and adapt to shocks and sudden disruptions in order to survive and thrive is critical.   Cranfield’s research into safety, risk and resilience from 2008 to present has established a new perspective and has provided meaningful guidance to organisations about the practical steps necessary to strengthen resilience for long\-term success.  Impact can be seen in the establishment of a new British Standard for Organisational Resilience; an improvement in Safety and Airspace Regulations for the UK Civil Aviation Authority, policy building in the European System of Central Banks and enhanced safety, risk and resilience outcomes for public and private sector organisations in the UK and internationally through application of Cranfield frameworks and models. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cranfield’s research into safety management, risk management, high reliability organisations and organisational resilience over the period 2008 to the present has been widely disseminated and applied by organisations within the UK and internationally and as such, has been impactful in reducing harm from disruptive events and ensuring the continuity of critical services and building organisational resilience and effectiveness. 

  

 Cranfield’s research into risk and safety management has contributed to a greater understanding of the barriers and enablers to effective and proactive management and organisational practice. 

  

###  Risk 

 Research into risk management practices carried out by Cranfield found that the existing approach of classifying the probability and consequence of known threats and connecting vertically from strategic or policy objectives to individual components, such as infrastructure, applications or operational processes, needed to be supplemented with a more mature and pervasive approach \[R1\] that connects horizontally across the ‘end to end’ delivery of essential services and focuses on adaptive capacity and recovery capabilities, based on the principles of high reliability organisations \[R2\].The research also found that engagement with risk management practices was driven by five beliefs: legitimacy \(the need to apply “best practice” standards\); value \(risk management must be demonstrably useful\); *competence* \(ability to control risk\); fact \(risks need to be tangible, perceptible and real\) and authority \(the need to have the power or authority to act\) \[R3\]. 

  

###  Safety 

 Cranfield carried out a funded project for the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health \(IOSH\) between 2013 and 2015 into safety leadership practices in low hazard/service sector organisations.  The resulting report identified management practices across sectors that both contribute to and limit safety and resilience \[R4\].  Cranfield also undertook a further funded research project for the IOSH into managing safety following organisational change through outsourcing, with a final report produced in 2019. \[R5\] 

  

 The University was commissioned in 2016 to undertake a safety assurance review for the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\), the world’s leading aviation safety regulator, of its Safety and Airspace Regulation Group \(SARG\).   In order to gain acceptance and credibility, the CAA needed their approach to safety assurance to be underpinned by the very latest research evidence.  The review led to over 100 recommendations and the development of a bespoke Safety Maturity Model as a methodology for CAA safety assurance activities, that could be embedded as an ongoing function and the development of a maturity model \[R1\], which is used to assess progress. 

  

###  Resilience 

 The concept of organisational resilience was further developed by Professor David Denyer using the Cranfield research synthesis methodology, which pulled together extant knowledge in the areas of safety, risk, crisis management \[R6\] and high reliability organisations \[R2\].  This concept built on previous approaches by providing an integrated, holistic framework, which acknowledged the crucial role of organisational behavior and culture, together with a methodology for diagnosis and implementation by organisations \[R7&R8\] 

  

 The Tension Quadrant framework and 4Sight methodology \[R7\], derived from the research, take a strategic, performance\-based, organisation\-wide perspective to organisational resilience.  The Tension Quadrant framework identifies four ways of thinking about Organisational Resilience: preventative control \(defensive consistency\), mindful action \(defensive flexibility\), performance optimization \(progressive consistency\) and adaptive innovation \(progressive flexibility\).  An additional element of the Tension Quadrant framework is the need for senior leaders to manage and balance the tensions between the four approaches through paradoxical thinking if organisations are to be truly resilient.  The 4Sight methodology helps those in leadership roles throughout the organisation introduce and sustain organisational resilience by developing four key practices: foresight, insight, oversight, and hindsight. 

  

 The research has provided the means for shifting standard management thinking from purely defensive measures and prevention, to the need for flexibility and agility, leveraging opportunities and driving innovation, helping organisations to remain competitive in challenging conditions.

###  Risk Management and Safety Assurance 

  

 Cranfield’s research into safety assurance has supported the ambition of the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\) to achieve a transformation from compliance\-based regulation to performance\-based regulation of aviation safety in the UK. Ben Alcott, Director, International Group has described the impact of the Cranfield risk and safety research as follows: 

 “This comprehensive, evidence\-based analysis of the CAA’s work has had a long\-standing impact on the organization, including the improvement of our safety culture, ways of working, thoughtful analysis and learning.” \[S1\] 

  

 The success of the review has also had far reaching consequences, with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency \(EASA\), also adopting the principles of the Safety Maturity model, which will be rolled out to encompass 27\+ European national Aviation Authorities and will provide the agency with a more holistic view of Member State performance \[S2\] 

 Cranfield’s Safety Maturity model was also adopted for application within an international helicopter company providing offshore transportation and search and rescue services through operations in the UK, Norway, Turkmenistan, Australia, Nigeria, Trinidad, Guyana and the Gulf of Mexico.  Former Safety Director \(now CEO of HeliOffshore\), reported: 

 “The tool ..resulted in each operation determining their own SMS maturity rating as well as identifying over 70 agreed actions across the organisation which were incorporated into regional Safety Improvement Plans and tracked towards completion.”  \[S3\] 

 Cranfield research\-based models of safety leadership have been widely disseminated via IOSH training programmes and applied work with organisations.  Siemens \[S4\] has used the Cranfield Outsourcing Safety framework to ensure maximum understanding, alignment and performance effectiveness between itself and its German sub\-contracting parties in the initial stages of a new power plant build. The aim was to create a “Partnership” between the Contractors and Siemens, based on understanding / commonality.  The results have been very encouraging, both from the Contractors and Siemens internally.  Any issues on site have been much easier to resolve due to the partnership in place.  Siemens is now compiling a Contractors Policy / Guidance based on the models used in the project to be shared more widely. 

  

###  Resilience 

  

 BSI \(British Standards Institution\) BS 65000 Guidance for Organisational Resilience, published in November 2014, was built on the foundation of research work at Cranfield \[S1\]. BS 65000 was described as a “landmark standard”, critical for the integration of crisis management and business continuity management, and in achieving a new level of coherence in the approach of organisations. \[S5\] 

  

 The European System of Central Bank’s Taskforce for Organisational Resilience has applied Professor David Denyer’s academic research into organizational resilience to formulate it’s baseline policy approach, assessment and application toolset and implementation guidelines.   Organisational resilience capabilities are seen to be of the utmost importance to the organisations represented on the Taskforce.  Central banks function to mitigate economic, financial and social risks via their monetary, currency and prudential policy actions. As such, the ability to effectively respond to change and disruption within their operating environments is critical to sustainably delivering on policy objectives and maintaining credibility, whether in respect of financial and monetary operations, or regulation of financial services. 

  

 “Through the application of the research, it became apparent that the toolsets could be applied both within and across a range of related organisations, providing insight at both an “enterprise” and “system” level.  This was of particular value to the work of the Taskforce in that the multi\-level application is directly relevant to the structure of the Eurosystem central banks \(i.e. countries operating the Euro currency\) where an integrated and harmonized approach to developing resilience is of critical importance.”  \[S6\] 

  

 Application of the Tension Quadrant framework has been used by organisations to maintain resilience during the Covid\-19 pandemic.  Managers from Personal Group attended a workshop on the framework two months before the start of the Covid\-19 lockdown in the UK.  Although the organization had done risk modelling exercises previously, they had remained a theoretical exercise.  Rebekah Tapping \(HR Director\) reported: 

 “the work we had done on the Strategic Tensions \(Tension Quadrant\) enabled us to maximise the opportunity to diversify as a result of the changes to our traditional ways of doing business that were impacted by the Lockdown and continuing COVID restrictions.” \[S7\] 

  

 AIRMIC \- the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce Ltd \- conducted an independent survey of 152 risk managers to evaluate the impact of Cranfield’s ‘Roads to Resilience’ research \[S8\].  The study also took the views of a number of associated professions, Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development; Chartered Insurance Institute, Business Continuity Institute; Association of Chartered Certified Accountants; Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors and the Institute of Risk Management.  The survey used Cranfield’s five principles of resilience as the yardstick for measuring progress in improving resilience.  Most respondents indicated that their organisations have embedded, to some extent, the five principles, with particular progress being made on 'rapid response', 'review and adapt', and 'relationships and networks' , with 48%, 34% and 33% having fully embedded the principles respectively.

public and private investments often for regional growth and development as well as policies aimed at improving productivity and firm growth in various forms. Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2019, the global animation market was valued approximately USD335,700,000,000 \( [<ins>Market Watch</ins>](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-animation-market-size-study-with-covid-19-impact-by-component-software-and-services-deployment-mode-cloud-and-on-premises-by-type-traditional-animation-2d-vector-based-animation-3d-computer-animation-motion-graphics-and-stop-motion-by-industry-media-and-entertainment-education-retail-healthcare-manufacturing-and-others-and-regional-forecasts-2020-2026-2021-02-26?siteid=bigcharts&dist=bigcharts&tesla=y), 2021\). This demand places significant pressures on animation studios to produce high\-quality virtual characters in a short time scale, which involves tedious and time\-consuming manual work. Since 2008, BU researchers have tackled this problem, leading to: 

-  The development of two new techniques: 

    -  Characteristic curve\-based dynamic skin deformation \[R1\] and, 

    -  Efficient numerical dynamic skin deformation to create a horse animation of 30 frames in less than 0.5 seconds \[R2\]. 

-  A European Commission funded research project \(2018\-2021, EUR535,500\) to develop new techniques \[T1\] and their software tools \[S1\] of partial differential equation\-based geometric modelling, image processing and shape reconstruction \(PDE\-GIR\). 

-  An Innovate UK funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) project \(2018\-2020, GBP173,010\) to develop new techniques of facial blendshapes \[R3, R7\]. The completed KTP project was awarded the highest grade of “Outstanding” by the KTP Grading Panel for its achievement in meeting KTP’s objectives. 

 BU’s research findings can be summarised as follows: 

####  Facial rigging tools 

1.  **Hybrid facial rigging tool.** This newly developed tool integrates facial blendshapes and bone\-driven facial animation to create various facial expressions easily and quickly \[R3\]. 

1.  **Automatic correspondences for deformation transfer.** To tackle the problem of deformation transfer in manually specifying correspondences of facial landmarks, this newly developed technique achieves full automation and avoids manual operations \[R3\]. This formed the basis of another Innovate UK funded project led by Humain Ltd. to develop a new technique of immersive hands. 

1.  **Machine learning\-based 3D facial expression production.** This technique combines a 3D face morphable model with machine learning to reuse existing datasets for reducing manual work in producing facial animation from a single image \[awaiting publication\]. 

####  Skin deformation techniques 

1.  **Automatic rigging.** Manually placing a skeleton in a 3D character model involves heavy manual operations. This newly developed technique automates the process and creates an animation skeleton in a few milliseconds \[R4\]. 

1.  **Analytical physics\-based skin deformation.** This technique \[R5\] was developed to tackle the difficulty in implementing the numerical dynamic skin deformation technique \[R2\] and achieve higher efficiency. It obtains the first analytical solution to physics\-based skin deformations to create the animation of a horse model with 10,128 vertices at 205 frames per second \[R5\]. 

####  Character modelling methods 

1.  **Fast character modelling with sketch\-based partial differential equation \(PDE\) surfaces.** To tackle the incapability of sketch\-based modelling in creating detailed 3D models easily and quickly, this project developed a simple, easy\-to\-use, efficient, and sketch\-based character modelling tool for fast creation of detailed character models \[R6\]. 

1.  **Character model creation with ordinary differential equation \(ODE\) based C2 continuous surfaces.** This technique was developed to avoid tedious and time\-consuming manual operations of existing techniques in stitching two separate patches together to achieve the required continuities, significantly reduce data size, and provide more flexible and powerful shape manipulation handles \[R7\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Producing high\-quality character animation involves time\-consuming manual work, making its production difficult and inefficient. Humain Ltd. aims to create the world’s best automated online character creation service through new techniques, to produce high\-quality virtual characters and their animation efficiently. 

 Dr Shaojun Bian was employed via the KTP to develop new techniques \[R3, R7: E1, E3, E4\]. She previously researched automatic rigging and skin deformation \[R2, R4\] as part of the European Commission funded PDE\-GIR project \( [<ins>http://pde\-gir.com/</ins>](http://pde-gir.com/)\). The new techniques developed by the PDE\-GIR project have been applied in Indeform Ltd. \[E3\], disseminated to many audiences through two PDE\-GIR workshops \[E4\], and provided a foundation for the subsequent KTP \[E5\] and resulting impact \[E2, E6\]. 

 As Humain Ltd. highly appraised, “BU development of the facial rigging tools and techniques for skin deformation, machine learning\-based 3D facial expression, fast character modelling with sketch\-based PDE surfaces and automatic rigging has given the company an edge over the competition, enabling the company to use photographic and video input into their process instead of a scan as well as use algorithms” \[E6\]. 

####  Impact on industry practices 

 Before developing the new techniques, getting a 3D virtual character into production required between a few days to a few months. The new techniques \[E1, E2\] enabled Humain Ltd. to automate the transfer of Action Units from their own database to another character, removing the need for 3D modellers, which “reduced the time frame to create complete models with realistic facial expressions from 30 days to a few minutes” \[E2, E6\]. This is a significant time and cost saving to Humain Ltd. 

 As well as saving time, the new techniques have helped to make Humain Ltd.’s workload more streamlined and efficient. Producing high\-quality 3D virtual character requires experts, modellers and animators from different disciplines to work together, and heavy and time\-consuming manual operations are involved in the production process. The new techniques have been integrated into the company’s product offerings, transformed the company’s facial development pipeline from a labour\-intensive process by highly specialized artists to a simple command line interface that everyone in the company can run. According to Humain, this has “enabled \[them\] to develop technology and capability that has moved the company from being purely considered as an outsource vendor to a state\-of\-the\-art R&D partner to world leading technology and entertainment leaders” \[E2, p.6\-8\]. 

 The impact on industry practices is also highlighted by Indeform Ltd.’s comments: the main benefits of PDE\-based modelling Blender plugin \[S1\] application in medical and engineering areas are “Flexibility and ability” and “Speed of predefined models generation”, “it takes seconds to generate new model”, and “This is a huge benefit” \[E3\]. 

####  Impact on innovation 

 Transforming Humain Ltd.’s ways of working has changed its external reputation. As Humain Ltd. stated, “the game\-changer contribution of BU researchers” has enabled the company “to achieve its goals while reducing the time and effort required to create a facial rig, which is a breakthrough which has and will become a huge profit centre for the company as it enables Humain to complete industry leading facial rigs with much fewer resources” \[E6\]. 

 The techniques developed by BU researchers at Humain Ltd. have made it possible for them to “work on cutting edge projects with world\-leading organisations in the technology and entertainment industry, such as Activision and Google, sign contracts to expand our portfolio and services \(e.g. Axis Studios and The Imaginarium\) and obtain further funding to develop our technology which have placed us as a reference in a highly competitive business market” \[E6\]. 

####  Economic impact 

 Humain’s increased competitiveness is demonstrated by the following examples: 

-  Humain Ltd. was asked by leading entertainment organisation HBO to provide the evidence of developing non\-photorealistic \(NPR\) characters. With the new techniques, Humain Ltd. delivered a fully realised NPR character with animation running inside the Unreal Engine, 24 hours later. Humain Ltd. won the USD400,000 contract \[E2, p.8\], beating two other competitors. 

-  The Imaginarium Studios required rigging characters for an innovative television show for a world leading streaming company. Using the developed techniques, Humain Ltd. offered a unique approach to capturing the actors’ movement and won the contract \[E2, p.8\]. 

-  The developed techniques contributed to the successful delivery of a GBP500,000 project to Microsoft \[E2, p.11\]. 

-  The developed techniques served as the basis for a successful application to the Audience of the Future Immersive Technology Investment Accelerator in 2019. The company secured GBP90,000 in equity investment from TechStart NI and GBP210,000 from Innovate UK \[E2, p.6\]. 

-  Over the past 3 years, the company has worked on 16 different projects, generating a revenue of GBP1,153,000 \[E6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Cancer causes 9,600,000 annual deaths worldwide \(160,000 in UK\) and half of all patients experience moderate to severe pain in the year before they die. Even in developed countries, inadequate assessment and treatment of pain leads to 30% of patients experiencing poor pain management before death, despite analgesia being available. 

 Research led by University of Leeds has been used by many national and international organisations to ensure patients with cancer and other advanced diseases receive appropriate and effective pain management before they die. For example, the Care Quality Commission used it to develop inspection standards for cancer\-related pain within NHS hospitals in England, while the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) changed the International Classification of Diseases \(ICD\) in 2018 to include the classification of cancer\-related pain. ICD is adopted by health care systems in 117 countries to improve diagnosis and customise treatment.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research at the University of Leeds, led by Professor Michael Bennett with international collaborations has: 

 \(a\) **Improved international assessment and classification of pain** 

 A systematic review of international literature \[ **1**\] established the first actual prevalence and causes of neuropathic pain \(pain from nerve damage, the most difficult type of pain to control\) in cancer patients. The review identified 22 studies involving 13,683 patients. For these studies, researchers performed sensitivity analyses on the prevalence estimates using different clinical assessment criteria. An international cohort study \[ **2**\] from 17 European centres recruited 1,051 patients and used standardised measures to reveal new insights into the adverse impact of neuropathic pain in cancer patients. These papers were internationally significant as the first research to highlight the importance of identifying this pain type in clinical practice to ensure more tailored treatment. 

 \(b\) **Determined effectiveness of and access to analgesia** 

 A Cochrane systematic review and meta\-analysis identified 17 studies that randomised 1,390 patients and was the first to establish that two commonly used strong opioids for cancer pain, oxycodone and morphine, were equally effective \[ **3**\]. This paper was also cited in NICE guidance for Opioids in palliative care. Detailed analysis of adverse effects gave clinicians clear evidence, for the first time, that either drug could be used as initial treatment. A further systematic review \[ **4**\] used a novel mixed treatment meta\-analysis to indirectly compare data from 5 randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\) on the relative effectiveness of rapid\-onset oral fentanyl formulations against morphine and a placebo for exacerbations of cancer pain \(called episodic pain\). No clinical trials had compared all three directly, which provided high quality evidence to include these reviews in clinical prescribing guidelines for cancer pain of European and North American cancer organisations such as the European Society for Medical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, respectively. 

 A retrospective cohort study \[ **5**\] linked routine data on diagnosis, health care resource use, and opioid prescribing in 6,050 patients who died from cancer. Overall access to strong opioids corresponded to that of other international literature but the study found that access occurred only a few weeks before death. It also uncovered significant inequalities in access to, and duration of, opioid treatment for older patients. This evidence was used in British Medical Association guidance to ensure that access to appropriate pain relief in palliative care is not affected by a patient’s age. 

 \(c\) **Established the importance of support for self\-management** 

 A systematic review and meta\-analysis \[ **6**\] was the first to demonstrate that interventions which support self\-management lead to significantly improved pain outcomes for cancer patients. These interventions consist of helping patients to understand pain and educating them in how to manage their medicines and get appropriate help, aspects that are often overlooked in routine care. The review included 21 RCTs which randomised 3,501 patients and provided a clear and significant estimate of effectiveness. Thus, we provided granular reports on the variations of effectiveness through sensitivity analyses of single dose with multiple dose studies, and of intervention with different methods of control.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our research has made an impact on health through cancer\-related pain management in the UK, and on international health policy through the WHO and cancer organisations across Europe and United States. These organisations influence international healthcare professional behaviour, benefitting patients living with and beyond cancer. Even so, it is difficult to provide robust data on patient impact because pain severity is not a routinely recorded health care outcome. 

 **IMPACT ON HEALTH** 

 **Care Quality Commission Inspection framework for end of life care** 

 Bennett, as member of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) original guidance committee on opioids for palliative care, led the dissemination of the original guideline in 2012 \[ **A**\]. He was also invited to chair NICE evidence committee to update the guidance in 2014 and 2016 \[ **B**\], which cites research in Leeds \[ **C**\]. The purpose of NICE guidance is to provide ‘evidence\-based recommendations to improve health and social care’ in the UK. The NICE guideline on opioids for palliative care remains in place. It recommends that healthcare professionals provide verbal and written information on strong opioid treatment to patients and carers, and supports self\-management. Additionally, since oxycodone and morphine are equally effective, the latter is cheaper and therefore to be used first line. 

 Bennett was also invited by the Faculty of Pain Medicine \(FPM\) in 2015 to lead development of NHS core standards for cancer\-related pain, “Core Standards for Pain Management Services in the UK \(CSPMS\)”. The FPM is the professional body responsible for the training, assessment, practice and continuing professional development of specialist medical practitioners in the management of pain in the UK. The FPM standards for cancer\-related pain incorporated Leeds evidence on supporting self\-management and focus on pain assessment; including access to analgesia, assisting patients and referral to specialist help \[ **D**\]. 

 Subsequently, the Care Quality Commission \(CQC\) developed an *inspection framework* in 2016 which incorporated both the NICE guidance on opioids in adult palliative care and the FPM standards for cancer\-related pain \[ **E**\]. CQC is the independent regulator of health and adult social care services in England; ensuring patients receive safe, effective and high\-quality care. Since 2016, all NHS Hospital Trusts must provide evidence of how they meet these standards and guidance; directly driving improvements in pain outcomes for cancer patients within the NHS. 

 Analysis of CQC inspection reports from 2016 onwards demonstrates that these standards have influenced inspection outcomes \[ **F**\]. Each of the following quotes, from various hospital inspection reports, corresponds to a CQC quality outcome which illustrates how pain was monitored and treated at end of life care: 

1.  “Pain assessments and pain scores were not completed consistently.” \(CQC outcome ‘Requires improvement’\); 

1.  ""Staff assessed and monitored patients regularly to see if they were in pain and gave pain relief in a timely way.” \(CQC outcome ‘Good’\); 

1.  “The specialist palliative care team worked with the specialist pain team, that included a combined multidisciplinary team meeting fortnightly to discuss patients with complex pain needs.” \(CQC outcome ‘Outstanding’\). 

 The Dean of FPM has confirmed Bennett’s role in the development of the FPM Core Standards, and the influence of his work to the CQC framework, “ *Prof Bennett’s contribution has been instrumental in articulating the Care Quality Commission \(CQC\) Inspection Framework in 2016: FPM standards for cancer\-related pain were incorporated in the CQC inspection framework and facilitated optimisation of pain management of patients in end\-of\-life care.*” \[ **G**\]. 

 **IMPACT ON INTERNATIONAL HEALTH POLICY** 

 **WHO International Classification of Diseases \(ICD\), 11<sup>th</sup> revision ICD\-11, Classification of chronic pain** 

 WHO is responsible for publishing the ICD since 1948. The ICD is regularly revised to keep up to date with health science and medical practice; ICD\-11 is the latest revision of the guidelines. Bennett was invited to serve on the international pain classification committee for ICD\-11, and to lead work on cancer pain taxonomy, as pain had not previously been represented within ICD. The inclusion of pain classification in the *ICD\-11 guidelines* represents a substantial international policy change \[ **H,I**\]. 

 ICD is used by 117 countries to define and study disease patterns, manage health care, and allocate resources. About 70% of the world’s health expenditures are allocated using ICD for reimbursement and resource allocation. ICD is the international standard for defining and reporting diseases and health conditions, for all clinical and research purposes. The inclusion of a cancer pain taxonomy provides a common language which allows health professionals to compare and share health information about cancer\-related pain across the globe. This is a significant and far\-reaching step forward for global recognition and coding of cancer\-related pain, driving international improvements in clinical care and research. Bennett is first author on the published taxonomy \[ **I**\], which also cites Leeds research, including papers on assessment of neuropathic pain and episodic pain in cancer patients. Taskforce Chair of the International Association for the Study of Pain has acknowledged Bennett’s role in the ICD\-11, *""Thanks to Michael Bennett’s work, the mechanism \(neuropathic\) and periodicity \(episodic\) features of cancer pain are now distinctly recognised in the classification system. This has benefitted standards of pain management in cancer patients and paved new way to the development of pain treatment and classification systems of pain.""* \[ **J**\]. 

 Using headache as an exemplar, having a common language and terminology has accelerated advancements in research regarding headache mechanisms, and type\-specific headache treatments. With an improved understanding of characteristics specific to a headache type, deriving an accurate headache diagnosis has substantially improved treatment outcomes through mechanism\- and evidence\-based treatment strategies.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Leston\-Bandeira’s research has changed the thinking of UK and international parliamentary officials on developing and implementing public engagement practices within their respective legislatures. In the UK, Leston\-Bandeira’s research has significantly influenced key elements of House of Commons public engagement practice, specifically in making its e\-petitions system more effective. Internationally, her research has informed and guided the parliaments of Australia, Brazil and Portugal on how to design and reform their public engagement efforts to make them more effective, more citizen\-led, and better positioned to shape parliamentary decisions. This has helped address the critical challenge of acute mistrust of politics in contemporary democracies.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Trust in political institutions in western democracies has been in decline over the last few decades, with only 19% in the UK saying they trust Parliament in 2019 **\[1\]**. Faced with rising levels of political disaffection, parliaments have become more pro\-active in developing ways of engaging with the public. However, this has been a slow and inconsistent process. Professor Leston\-Bandeira has researched this development, identifying how specific characteristics of parliamentary institutions influence the effectiveness of public engagement activities. 

 The discipline of legislative studies has traditionally focused on the relationship between parliament and government, neglecting parliaments’ relationship with citizens. Leston\-Bandeira made a significant contribution in shifting this focus toward research on parliamentary public engagement \(PPE\). Through comparative research across different legislatures **\[1\]**, she has examined specific forms of public engagement that have become particularly popular with parliaments, such as digital engagement and the use of e\-petitions. Her findings in this area can be summarised as: 

-  Identification of a systemic ‘institutional representation’ of parliament, characterised by a collective and abstract style of representation, which constrains the practices of PPE **\[1\]**; 

-  Establishment of the importance of symbolic representation \(i.e. where representation is embodied in symbols, such as a building, rather than political messages\) in the way the public develops connections to the parliamentary institution, and through which public engagement can act **\[1,3,4\]**; 

-  Identification of the importance of integrating the activity of public engagement with actual parliamentary business rather than developing it separately **\[2,4,5\]**; 

-  Evaluation of what makes for effective PPE, namely that it should be issue\-based, go where the people are, and use a multiplicity of channels of communication and methods **\[2,4,5\]**. 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s research identified how the structures and processes of parliament – what she calls ‘institutional representation’ – inhibit implementation of public engagement activities. Parliaments are collective institutions lacking a single voice that speaks for the institution **\[1,3\]**. They serve multiple agendas of different actors, often in conflict with each other and the institution itself. Moreover, parliaments are highly visible institutions accountable to the public. The combination of these characteristics hinders organisational decision\-making, rendering parliaments particularly cumbersome, slow and risk\-averse institutions; all of which are detrimental to the development of public engagement, which requires innovative, quick and flexible decision\-making processes. Leston\-Bandeira’s research into parliamentary initiatives implementing public engagement has shown them to be led often by procedural objectives, such as the formal process to consider a bill, rather than engagement\-oriented objectives, such as listening to the public’s views **\[2,4\-6\]**. The research has outlined that PPE relies mainly on the input from parliamentary officials, rather than politicians, and *avoids* politics **\[1\-3\]**, which explains why symbolic representation has become a key vehicle for facilitating engagement between legislatures and the public. Her co\-developed research with the UK House of Commons Petitions Committee provided further evidence of the value of integrating public engagement with parliamentary business and focusing on the public rather than parliamentary processes **\[4\-6\]**. 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s analysis of specific public engagement activities, such as e\-petitions **\[4\-6\]** and the integration of the public’s voice into the legislative process **\[2\]**, has enabled a better understanding of how PPE can become more effective. The research stresses the importance of thinking carefully about the parliamentary processes in place and avoiding the pitfalls of developing public engagement as an add\-on. It also shows that the public engages with parliament on issues that matter to them, rather than because of a generic desire to engage with democracy **\[2,4,5\]**. This implies an approach to public engagement focused on the public and their concerns, rather than on parliament and its processes, as well as one that integrates the public’s input into parliamentary business, rather than as a parallel activity.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s research has \(i\) altered parliamentary officials’ understanding of public engagement in Australia, Brazil, Portugal and the UK, and \(ii\) changed how public engagement is implemented in the Brazilian, Portuguese and UK parliaments. Her research has provided an evidence\-base and policy recommendations that have helped parliamentarians better understand, enhance and promote engagement with the public. Whilst parliaments have therefore been the direct beneficiaries of her research, the general public also ultimately benefits through access to more effective mechanisms \(e.g. e\-petitions\) and greater capacity within parliaments to facilitate this engagement. 

 **i\) Changing understandings of public engagement within parliaments** 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s longstanding expertise on PPE has led to invitations from several legislatures to be part of key commissions reviewing public engagement processes and/or to give evidence to key inquiries. She was first invited in 2014 by the Speaker of the UK House of Commons to be the only academic among eight core members of the *Digital Democracy Commission* \(DDC\). Since then, drawing on her research developed at the University of Leeds, she has continued to be involved in the implementation of the DDC report’s recommendations within the UK Parliament, engaging with officials on a regular basis across a range of services, from committees to digital engagement. This has led to further invitations and a deeper working relationship with parliamentary officials in a range of legislatures besides the UK Parliament. In 2016, she was invited by the President of the Portuguese Parliament to be the special adviser to their *Digital Parliament Commission \(*DPC\), which was followed by an invitation to help shape and give evidence to the Scottish Parliament’s *Parliamentary Reform Commission* \(PRC\) in November 2016. These Commissions and their subsequent implementation work drew heavily from her research **\[1\-3,5,6\]**, with Leston\-Bandeira’s input being instrumental in highlighting the importance of focusing parliamentary tools on the needs of the public, rather than on parliamentary processes. The former UK House of Commons Speaker explains that her *‘evidence\-based approach’* made *‘an enormous contribution to the success of the \[DDC\]’* **\[A\]**, whilst the Portuguese Parliament’s President remarks that collaborating with Leston\-Bandeira was *‘invaluable’* for the DPC **\[B\]**. 

 In 2019, Leston\-Bandeira played an important role in the House of Commons Liaison Committee’s inquiry into the effectiveness of select committees. Besides her formal submission of evidence, she was closely involved in the set\-up of the public engagement themes of this inquiry, as well as shaping the inquiry’s recommendations. She was firstly invited to a private meeting of the Committee, where she made key contributions, as recognised by the Former Chair of the Committee in her letter commending Leston\-Bandeira’s involvement **\[C\]**; this was followed by meetings with the Committee’s clerks in the run up to the writing of the inquiry’s report. Leston\-Bandeira’s research on PPE became a key piece of evidence convincing the Committee of the need for a more systemic approach to public engagement and of the importance of listening rather than broadcasting, reflected in the report’s first heading about public engagement \( **\[D\]**, p. 22\). Her evidence was cited 17 times in the report to support a move towards a more integrated use of public engagement across committee work, rather than as a parallel or an add\-on activity, and the adoption of more accessible formats in committee reports in order to reach a wider audience of citizens. One of the most senior officials of the House of Commons at the time, the Clerk of Committees, stated that the ‘ *landmark report*’ established that committees should ‘ *turn towards the public in all committee activity’* **\[D\]**. 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s research has also impacted upon the planning of public engagement by the House of Lords, namely through the written and oral evidence she submitted to its Constitution Committee in 2018, specifically on effectively integrating public engagement into the law\-making process **\[2,a\]**. This evidence was cited in the inquiry’s report, with paragraphs 110 to 112 listing further opportunities for public engagement in the legislative process, directly following Leston\-Bandeira’s own recommendations **\[E\]**. 

 Beyond Westminster, Leston\-Bandeira’s research has informed the Scottish Parliament PRC’s 2017 conclusions, namely recommendations no. 62 and 67 , which call for the creation of a Committee Engagement Unit and a *‘more personalised system of feedback to those who engage with it*’ \( **\[F\]**, p. 61, 66\). Both recommendations reflect Leston\-Bandeira’s oral and written evidence calling for a better integration between public engagement and parliamentary business by focussing on committees and being issue\-led, which makes sure the feedback loop to citizens is closed. The new Unit was subsequently created in 2018, with which Leston\-Bandeira has continued collaboration and direct policy change. As noted by the Head of the Committee, Leston\-Bandeira *‘was a key influence on the remit given to my unit… focusing on issues\-based engagement in the work of committees \(…\) we have drawn on \[her\] research in developing our engagement practice \(…\) in particular her findings about the importance to citizens of the engagement process \(…\) \[and\] on the role of social media in public engagement to develop our use of social media towards dialogue rather than just information giving’* **\[F\]**. 

 As outlined above, Leston\-Bandeira has also changed the thinking of parliamentary officials beyond the UK. In 2019 she was invited for a Visiting Fellowship in Brazil where she advised officials in the Brazilian Congress on the integration of public engagement into parliamentary structures, based on her research on e\-petitions **\[6\]**. The Head of the e\-Citizenship Programme of the Brazilian Senate confirms, *‘her research on the UK e\-petitions system \(…\) enlightened me and directly influenced me \(…\). This \[new method\] enables citizens to have a clearer perception of how their input into the Senate’s e\-Citizenship programme has led to specific draft bills and other outputs’* **\[G\]**. The international reach of her research is further demonstrated by invitations from the petitions committees of the Australian Parliament and of Western Australia’s State Legislature, which cited specifically her expertise when inviting her: *‘given your work on parliament and public engagement, the Committee is interested in your insights into the role of petitions in a modern parliament*’ **\[H\]**. Leston\-Bandeira’s evidence was cited eight times in the Australian Parliament’s report on their petitions system, in relation to how debates on petitions are conducted. The committee subsequently recommended the introduction of debates on petitions to enhance petitions’ visibility **\[H\]**. 

 **ii\) Changing how parliaments implement public engagement** 

 Besides changing understandings of public engagement, Leston\-Bandeira’s research has also impacted upon actual practices, with consequent benefits for both officials and the general public. She was involved with key preparatory work for the new UK Parliament e\-petitions system launched in 2015. Since then, over 70,000 petitions have been submitted to this new system, with over 21,000 accepted, nearly 200 debated and over 24 million unique signatures. Since joining Leeds in 2015, she has worked closely with the new Petitions Committee to provide research evidence and expert advice on the new system’s processes and policy, to make it more impactful in terms of policy effect and petitioners’ satisfaction. This has been facilitated via over 100 regular meetings, email correspondence with the Committee staff, co\-development of research and participation in events. 

 These activities were supported by an ESRC\-funded Impact Acceleration Account Knowledge Exchange Fellowship for Leston\-Bandeira awarded in 2016 **\[b\]**, which allowed her to shadow the Petitions Committee in 2016/17 and study its workings. This has led to continuing knowledge exchange and co\-production with the Committee \(with over 30 meetings with Committee staff and in excess of 100 email exchanges since the Fellowship\), developing further research on the processes implementing the e\-petitions system and petitioners’ reactions to these **\[5,6\]**. This resulted in a 2017 report to the Committee, outlining five overarching recommendations and 39 specific recommendations **\[4\]**, which has had a strong impact on the e\-petitioning process. As one of the Committee’s officials remarked: *‘Cristina’s research showed us that we were concentrating very much on what we could do, on changes that we could make \(…\). But looking at the report and the recommendations, it was quite clear that that was exactly our bias – it didn’t reflect what needed to be done to achieve our aim of really enhancing the relationship between Parliament and the public’* **\[I\]**. As a result, the Petitions Committee has adopted Leston\-Bandeira’s 2017 report as a key element in its development, utilising her recommendations to plan further developments in the system, directly informing the Committee’s Public Engagement Strategy. A Committee official explained the importance of the report for the Committee’s self\-reflection: *‘the report and her work is frequently brought up in discussions about how we can do better, when we examine our working practices and is used as evidence to support the changes we need’* **\[J\]**. This led to changes, such as a differentiated focus on petitioners, by inviting them to the parliamentary debate of their e\-petition, and an enhancement of the petitions debates so as to be more inclusive and integrated with parliamentary business. Specifically, the Committee used her research *‘to evidence the need for changes to the e\-petitions site, such as changing the language used’* and *‘to bid successfully for resources to connect petitioners with other items of parliamentary business related to the topic of their petition, which will affect how millions of people engage with Parliament’* **\[J\]**. 

 Besides her work with the Petitions Committee, Leston\-Bandeira has influenced how digital engagement is implemented in the House of Commons. For example, following a DDC recommendation to introduce ‘digital debates’, she led on a collaborative project with the House of Commons to investigate enhancement of digital engagement. Thanks to this collaboration, in 2019 three committees \(on plastics use in packaging, pavement parking, and endangered species\) accepted suggestions based on her research **\[2,4,6\]** to link their inquiries to ongoing petitions. This helped the Committees reach a wider public affected by the issues addressed in the inquiries \(for example, in excess of 300,000 people in the case of the report into plastics use;  [EFRA 2019](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmenvfru/2080/2080.pdf), p.5\). 

 In addition, Leston\-Bandeira’s research **\[6\]** has informed the new e\-petitions system and digital platforms in the Portuguese Parliament, inaugurated in 2018, by making it more public centred and enabling the public to track the progress of their e\-petition. This resulted in a completely new approach on the parliament’s website, adopting open data, and a more citizen\-oriented communication approach. The President of the Portuguese Parliament explains that Leston\-Bandeira’s work *‘was decisive to develop even further the investment on citizens’ participation and to advance towards more and better instances of bilateral communication with citizens \(namely through the creation of the online platforms, on Parliament’s new portal, the submission and collection of signatures of petitions, citizens’ legislative initiatives and popular referendums’ initiatives\)’* **\[B\]**. Her research **\[5,6\]** has also led to changes in elements of the Brazilian Senate’s *E\-Cidadania* platform to make the outputs of petitioning clearer to those citizens making suggestions for policy change **\[G\]**. 

 Leston\-Bandeira’s research has therefore both affected how officials perceive the purpose and use of public engagement, and resulted in changes in the actual practice of public engagement of at least three parliaments.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The built environment accounts for approximately 40% of the UK’s carbon footprint. This research by Professor Andy Ford and Dr Aaron Gillich has realised a three\-pronged, networked approach for decarbonising the UK’s buildings. It comprises: 

-  Using Artificial Intelligence to eliminate energy inefficiencies in **Building Energy Management Systems** \(BEMS\), reducing energy costs by 10\-30%, cutting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by **37,000**t annually and yielding **GBP6,900,000 \(£6.9m\) annual cost savings.** 

-  The **Balanced Energy Network** \(BEN\) concept, the implementation of which has reduced fossil fuel use by 30% and carbon dioxide emissions by 9% in the blocks where it is installed. 

-  The creation of the **CEREB Policy Framework** for scaling up multi\-stakeholder, low\-carbon solutions across existing buildings, which has shaped a GBP4,700,000 \(£4.7m\) UK Government programme.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The UK Climate Policy has set a goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This won’t be achieved without a transformation of the built environment. Professor Ford has developed a three\-pronged approach to decarbonising existing buildings, comprised of: 1\) reducing energy use in buildings by optimising performance; 2\) decarbonising the heating and cooling systems by reducing fossil fuel use; and 3\) accelerating the adoption of these innovations by creating a market transformation policy framework. 

  

 Recognising that industry has been cautious towards innovation in the built environment, Professor Ford’s approach embedded industry partners as key research stakeholders, pairing research with practical demonstration to maximise the uptake of low\-carbon innovations. 

  

 **Reducing carbon emissions by optimising building performance** 

 Building Energy Management Systems \(BEMS\) monitor and control a building’s energy needs. They provide non\-domestic building performance data, including data which isn’t routinely analysed but can be queried in the event of problems. The complexity of this data and the lack of understanding of how to process and analyse the enormous datasets has hindered the ability of BEMS to deal with energy inefficiencies arising from components known as Terminal Units \(TUs\). These units regulate the volume of conditioned primary air directed into a particular space from the central air handler \(i.e. the central heating, ventilation and air\-conditioning \(HVAC\) system\). There can be hundreds or even thousands of TUs in a building, depending on its size. 

 LSBU investigated the use of Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) to develop and integrate energy efficiency into BEMS. This research was conducted with three commercial partners: Demand Logic, Verco and EDSL. The project focused on addressing the problematic building energy ‘performance gap’. Verco led the portfolio scale decarbonisation work, EDSL supported the building level simulations, whilst the Demand Logic team worked with Professor Ford to ascertain extant practice for identifying TU issues: this was found to comprise manually investigating BEMS data. The team established that the development of an automated method for remotely identifying faults would revolutionise identification and management of faulty TUs, improve BEMS performance and transform energy efficiencies. 

  

 The outcome of the research was an AI\-driven system which pre\-processes, clusters and classifies TUs into well\- and badly\-behaved elements, displaying results in a user\-friendly manner. Problems that were originally difficult to identify and characterise were automatically classified by the new technology. An additional benefit was the detection of non\-faults wrongly classified as faults by BEMS. For instance, a building design fault: e.g. a TU inadvertently not connected to its temperature sensor by a retrofitted partition wall, makes the normal TU persist, without success, to bring the room temperature to the desired level. These “false rogue” TUs are difficult to manually detect but were easily automatically identified and rectified **\[R1\]** by the developed system. 

 **Low\-carbon solutions for heat networking individual buildings** 

 Achieving net zero carbon emissions in buildings requires ending the use of natural gas for heat generation. Heat pumps are a proven low\-carbon alternative to gas boilers. However, heat pumps deliver heat at a lower temperature than a gas boiler and usually require other building upgrades such as insulation or larger heat emitters to maintain comfortable conditions. Heat networks can offer improved efficiencies compared to heating individual buildings, particularly 5<sup>th</sup> Generation \(ambient temperature\) networks linked with heat pumps, but there is slow uptake, in part due to a lack of proven demonstrations of the technology in the UK. 

  

 In order to address these barriers, Professor Ford developed the Balanced Energy Network \(BEN\) research project into a successful GBP2,900,000 \(£2.9m\) Innovate UK Proposal \(\#102624\) **\[G1\]**. The BEN project integrated innovations from five industry partners and two universities in order to: 1\) demonstrate the UK’s first 5th Generation heat network at scale; and 2\) link this network to heat pumps that could replace a gas boiler like\-for\-like and offer a simple low\-carbon heating retrofit solution to existing commercial buildings. 

 BEN links two buildings together using an ambient temperature network served by two open\-loop boreholes connected to the London aquifer. One of the outputs of the research was bespoke heat pumps that sit within each building and produce heat at the same temperature as a gas boiler. This allows the pumps to link with the existing systems without requiring any other modifications to the buildings. The heat pumps reduce carbon emissions by offsetting gas use. BEN’s heat pumps not only proved to be a viable like\-for\-like replacement for the gas boiler, but also they could maintain a high coefficient of performance by linking with a 5<sup>th</sup> Generation Heat Network. This reduces overall electricity use and the burden on the National Grid. Finally, Professor Ford’s BEN research proved that these low\-carbon heating innovations could be integrated within an active campus environment in central London, offering a low\-carbon heating retrofit solution which is highly generalisable across other UK buildings **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. 

  

 BEN also catalysed a major programme of LSBU applied research funded by BEIS **\[G2, G3\]** into how to further refine heat pump design and extract low\-carbon heat from other sources such as the ground and the sewer networks. 

 **Policy development to scale up implementation of retrofit decarbonising solutions across the UK building stock** 

 Professor Ford and Dr Gillich investigated policy pathways to deploying technical solutions at scale. Most policies targeting technical measures focused on the measures in the short term, rather than the enabling systems necessary to support their delivery longitudinally. 

 Dr Gillich used a policy theory\-based evaluation methodology to investigate >50 retrofit market transformation programmes across the UK, Canada, and the United States **\[R5\]**. This was among the first applications of this methodology into the study of retrofit market transformation, producing new insights into the range of market actions needed to support long\-term change beyond the period of public subsidy. 

  

 A very common policy outcome is for market activity to surge during a subsidy program, then collapse when the subsidy is removed. The Market Transformation approach advanced by Dr Gillich’s research proposes a novel methodology to use program funds to invest in activities that result in lasting market effects after the subsidy is removed. This yielded the *CEREB* \(Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Buildings\) Framework, articulating five pillars of Retrofit Market Transformation: 1\) Programme Design and Stakeholder Networks; 2\) Marketing and Outreach; 3\) Workforce Engagement and Training; 4\) Financial Incentives; and 5\) Data \[collection/analysis?\] and Evaluation. For each pillar, the CEREB Framework gives activities, indicators, and success factors required to decarbonise existing buildings **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Reducing carbon emissions by optimising building performance**: 

 The collaboration with Demand Logic \(DL\) benefited the company in a number of ways. Testimony from the CEO states that: “ *Overall the collaboration provided a step change in our product features, our working practices regarding implementing AI analysis and enabled us to investigate more around the end user’s role in building energy consumption \(and reduction techniques\), leading us to further product developments. Specifically, the research conducted at LSBU enabled BEMS data of any type to be pre\-processed automatically and to be made easily available via a RADAR chart \(an easy to read visual chart that classifies and displays the good and misbehaving terminal units in a building\) to determine which are the terminal units who are operating as designed, and which are causing energy and comfort problems, and pivotally why they seem to be misbehaving*.” **\[S1\]** 

 The BEMS AI tool is now used by leading property companies. The main beneficiaries of the improved DL products are their clients. DL report **\[S2\]** that their clients save GBP6,900,000 \(£6.9m\) in energy costs annually and reduce annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 37,000t. 

 The number of deployed installations by Demand Logic improved by LSBU’s research contribution has grown substantially over time. The platform is currently in use in 118 buildings totalling 1,400,000 m<sup>2</sup> of real estate. The following example looking at just one installation is typical of the impact in each of these buildings. 

 *Demand Logic at* *20 Fenchurch Street \(Landsec\)* **\[S3\]** 

 Landsec Group plc, the largest commercial property development and investment company in the UK, owns and manages 335,000 m<sup>2</sup> of buildings. One of their most familiar commercial sites is 20 Fenchurch Street, London \(known colloquially as the “Walkie\-Talkie”\). HVAC systems account for approximately two\-thirds of 20 Fenchurch Street’s energy consumption. The environment in this 34\-storey tower is controlled by 1,200 air conditioning units, with over 175,000 data points which generate 17,000,000 data values on building performance every day **\[S4\]**. Day\-to\-day management of the building’s performance is split between the landlord and tenant’s engineering teams. This is common for multi\-tenanted buildings and often presents a challenge for reducing operational energy consumption. The Landsec team now uses Demand Logic data visualisation to engage with the tenant, Allied World; consequently, Allied World agreed to re\-set the temperature set\-points and to widen the temperature range. The impact was immediate, as monitored by Demand Logic: analysis revealed a 27% reduction in demand of both heating and cooling as well as a 62% reduction in heating power **\[S3\]**. 

 The approach also allowed for a change in operating procedure by the facilities management team. The usual mode is reactive maintenance, responding to tenants’ complaints and concerns. The use of Demand Logic’s LSBU research\-enabled, AI\-driven interface, facilitated a proactive way of working, using data to identify individual components which are misbehaving. It is effective in reducing energy consumption; enabling engineers to focusing their time on assessing and prioritising issues; and reducing the number of complaint calls requiring reactive maintenance **\[S3\]**. 

 **Low\-carbon technical solutions for individual buildings and district heat networks** 

 The Balanced Energy Network \(BEN\) installed at LSBU’s campus has had the direct impact of reducing fossil fuel use by 30% and carbon dioxide emissions by 9% for the connected buildings in its first year of operation **\[S5\]**. This has also contributed to the wider impact of phasing out gas from the LSBU campus. Through BEN and a range of other measures including light bulb replacements and switching to renewable electricity tariffs, LSBU has achieved an overall 85% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in the past decade. 

  

 This project has had significant beneficial outcomes for the industry lead, ICAX Ltd, including: 

  

 *Commercial benefits:* ICAX has developed a second generation of the heat pumps created for the BEN project and is currently installing these on several projects: To date, ICAX has been commissioned to install 3.7MW of these second generation heat pumps, with eight further projects currently in the pipeline. ICAX is also currently installing 3.4MW of these heat pumps across three sites for the London Borough of Southwark, in three housing estates consisting of 2,175 households **\[S6\]**. 

 *Ability to Deliver Environmental Benefits:* Three systems currently being installed in Southwark are designed to save over 57,000t of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over a twenty\-year time span through an energy saving of 17,690,743kWh per annum **\[S6\].** 

  

 In addition, the approach has enabled ICAX to participate in several projects across the UK looking at the feasibility of town\-wide networks and smaller scale domestic heat pumps. As a result of the success of these projects, ICAX has won a coveted place on the competitive BEIS Scale\-Up programme \(40 businesses across all sectors in the UK\), and is currently on track to manufacture residential heat pump products in the UK in 2021. The company is targeting growth to a turnover of GBP101,000,000 \(£101m\) by 2025 \(from a 2020 base of GBP1,500,000 \(£1.5m\)\), largely driven by the domestic heat pump products originating from the BEN research **\[S6\]**. 

  

 Industry guidance has been influenced with publication of CIBSE open loop source systems and the 2020 CIBSE CP1 Heat Networks Codes of Practice \(COP\) being updated to increase reference to heat pumps and include mention of 5<sup>th</sup> Generation networks **\[S8\]**. This latter COP is a widely referenced document in the UK for Heat Network design guidance and project specification. 

  

 **Policy implementation to scale up research across the UK building stock** 

 The ‘market transformation’ concepts advanced in Dr Gillich’s CEREB Framework have gained traction recently as the UK seeks successors to the Green Deal. Dr Gillich has contributed to a number of evidence reviews including the ‘ *What Works*’ paper, the Policy Exchange Scotland Evidence Review, and the GLA’s *Green New Deal* mission. Dr Gillich’s research led to his working directly with BEIS on secondment and informed development of the £4.7M ‘ *Local Supply Chain Demonstration*’ program, which delivered retrofits in 6 pilot projects across the UK. The policy focused on investing in local intermediaries such as contractor networks and enablers such as ‘retrofit advisors’ to link up homeowners with suitable installers. Retrofit policies incentivise the measures themselves during the program, but typically do not use program funds to support networks and intermediaries that can keep on installing them once the program has ended. Investing in this type of supply chain network is among the pillars of the CEREB Framework and was not common practice for BEIS at the time **\[S9\]**. This in turn led to Dr Gillich working with Local Authority Sustainability Officers to implement pillars of the CEREB Framework in Lambeth Council<ins>,</ins> who have recently declared a climate emergency and are using Dr Gillich’s Framework to inform their strategy to decarbonise existing buildings **\[S10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The city of Portsmouth, dominated by its naval dockyard, has traditionally celebrated and commemorated the achievements of men, and was considered little touched by feminism. However, the research expertise of Dr Sue Bruley and Dr Laurel Forster, in collaboration with local community groups, has led to the rediscovery of a history of feminist campaigning since the 1960s. With Heritage Lottery Fund support, this project has had a positive impact upon its participants, the local community and a global audience. The women whose stories are now preserved forever have experienced validation and increased self\-esteem. Wider groups who attended events and participated in the project now have a changed and better\-informed understanding of this history. And a growing global audience, increasingly able to access this new record through archive availability and online media, is being educated and inspired to action by the potential power of ordinary women’s life narratives and grassroots activism.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The academic expertise of Bruley and Forster, demonstrated in research over a period of twenty years on British social and media narratives, has contributed to a substantial revision of the history of the British Women’s Liberation Movement \(WLM\). Earlier accounts of the WLM tended to address the well\-known feminists of the movement, and with a focus upon London\-centric activism. This newly\-uncovered feminist history redresses that balance and draws attention to the second\-wave activism of local women, facing local issues. 

 Bruley’s research has developed over an extensive career, initially focussed upon women’s history of the first half of the twentieth century, where it addressed topics including women’s life\-narration in the Second World War, and the contested history of labour and community activism in the mining towns of South Wales. Her later work \(2013\-2017\) on second\-wave feminism has brought to attention ways in which feminism was present and embedded in towns across the United Kingdom \(R5\). Bruley has worked with local networks and archives to highlight regional feminist communities in English towns, and her research offers a new understanding of the negotiations necessary for localised feminist activism \(R2\). As part of her research, Bruley has formed a ground\-breaking analysis of a dispersed feminism as a political phenomenon of the later twentieth century, and the significance of consciousness\-raising as an important contributing factor in this feminist process \(R1\). Throughout this work, Bruley’s use of oral\-history methodology has brought to light information and understandings that would otherwise have been hidden from conventional textual research. 

 Forster’s research specialism in feminist media histories, women’s writing and narratives, and the representation of everyday women in the media, has brought both specific and wider context to the project \(R6\). Her 2015 writings on periodicals and broadcast magazines explore diverse implications and influences of women’s media \(R3\). In particular, her research into the reporting of WLM activism enabled the project to identify national campaigns and issues, and to transpose these onto a local investigation. Her interviews and research concerning a local Southern Television programme, *Houseparty*, which facilitated women’s conversation, and interests, brought understanding of regionality and individual feminisms to the project \(R4\). 

 As feminist scholars, Bruley and Forster are committed to the necessary and productive overlap of academic and community approaches to history. Thus their first engagement with the specific story of Portsmouth and the WLM was a 2014 Portsmouth University conference: ‘Situating Women’s Liberation: Historicising a Movement’, convened by Bruley with Forster and Professor June Purvis. This built upon the three organisers’ substantial research on the first and second ‘waves’ of feminism and their associations with the national Women’s History Network. The conference welcomed local women as well as expert academic speakers. Non\-academics were encouraged to address the whole conference and talk about their personal engagement with female politics. The academic papers were published in the peer\-reviewed journal, *Women’s History Review \(WHR\)*, and this special edition has become a standard resource, with subsequent republication as hardback book \(Routledge, 2018\), paperback, and kindle versions \(December 2020\). Significant community enthusiasm for a local history project, focussed upon Portsmouth women, was evident from the conference. This began a process of structured collaboration, detailed in Section 4, which would become the Heritage Lottery Fund \(HLF\)\-supported project \(G1\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Bruley and Forster’s findings began with the community and activist response generated by the 2014 conference. Bruley and Forster guided and encouraged participation in a ‘Women’s Liberation Witness Day’ \(June 2015\), and five further ‘Witness’ meetings \(2015\-2017\), which brought together local ex\-activists to talk about their experiences in a public forum. As women gave voice to their personal testimonies, other long\-forgotten activisms and fellow female campaigners were remembered. Word of mouth through Portsmouth’s tight\-knit community, led to a proliferation of individuals, campaign leaders and supporters of marginalised groups to be interviewed. 

 Bruley and Forster considered these early testimonials when preparing the HLF bid. Based on the findings of their own research, they devised a way of transposing individual life stories onto more general struggles women faced living and working in a naval city, and then onto even broader national WLM concerns. They formed partnerships with the city’s history centre, schools, community centres, and the University of the Third Age \(U3A\) Portsdown branch, to continue the work. Bruley and Forster sought advice from other academics and extended the reach of the project. They contacted women’s ethnic minority groups in the city, involved the local council, reached out to a range of women’s campaigning groups \(concerned with issues from pensions to plastics\) and harnessed the strong city interest in local history. 

 The successful HLF grant bid \(G1, awarded December 2017, GBP76,000\) was entirely dependent on the convincing combination of Bruley and Forster’s initial research findings, their joint expertise, and the array of groups they had brought together to endorse its aims. The grant supported a committee of academics and local partners, and enabled a permanent voice to be given to female activists, creating an official record of the pioneering work of local women. Moreover, this project piloted a new methodology for engaging marginalised and underrepresented women's groups and local female activists. This involved training over 20 younger volunteers in interview techniques and Oral History practice, enabling them to interview nearly 60 older feminists, activists and women’s groups. This brought about cross\-generational and cross\-cultural understanding. Additionally, volunteers from the U3A assisted with archiving for the City’s History Centre. Such cascading of skills involved public bodies, local groups and interested individuals. 

 The project, with over 20 public talks, training events, community\-centre visits and touring exhibitions, has rekindled interest in, and reawakened awareness of,  a feminist history of late\-twentieth\-century Portsmouth. Lectures, ‘memory days’, touring exhibitions of the ‘talking table’, and a ‘teachers’ pack’, enabled local communities to hear these new narratives. This project has catalysed a shift in understanding and placed women’s pioneering action at the forefront of Portsmouth’s history. Not only has the lived experience of the city’s women been retrieved from the shadow of a male\-dominated conventional history, but further layers have been added to it, revealing a multi\-cultural history, paving the way for current generations to see their home city in a new, more inspiring light. 

 <ins> **Increasing Awareness of Women’s Activism**</ins> 

 The general programme of public lectures and informal events at various city venues, attracted audiences of up to 150, included women and men, age ranges of 8 to 80, with professional and amateur interest in local history. Attendees reported learning *“A huge amount”* \[text removed for publication\], with some expressing an intention to continue the work: *“I’ll definitely be following up with some research of my own”*. Older attendees, such as \[text removed for publication\], appreciated the recovered narratives which *“brought back many memories and changes in society during my life \[...\] Children need to know this social history”.* These events also inspired future women’s activism, as teenager \[text removed for publication\] said: *“The lecture was extremely inspirational as it teaches women to stand up for their rights”* \(S6\). 

 \[Text removed for publication\], a local councillor, said: *“The booklet taught me incredible amounts. Also the diverse range of women. \[...\] The story about CND being a major presence in Pompey blew my mind.”* Cross\-generational education of women’s activism was evidenced, as \[text removed for publication\] explained how: *“My daughter \(11\) and son \(18\) \[...\] were really impacted by all the stories and what women have done to improve life in our city. And impacted by CND and Mums being arrested\!\!”* Augmented perceptions of Portsmouth women’s contributions are now a valued cultural history. \[Text removed for publication\] noted: *“I found it both interesting and reassuring to hear of the project and its importance to those taking part \[...\] it should be a more important part of Pompey history  \[...\] at the City Museum or a display at the Guildhall or other public places”* \(S6\). 

 <ins> **Enhancing Skills and Dialogue in Gathering Women’s Narratives**</ins> 

 As part of the Project methodology, younger women were trained to interview older women. As well as providing concrete upskilling for this group, it also promoted intergenerational dialogue, and delivered a stimulus to further reflection. \[Text removed for publication\] commented: *“It’s a really interesting project and I think that it’s something necessary for every community”* \(S6\). All learnt new interviewing techniques, \[text removed for publication\] said, *“I’m excited about learning new skills”,* and went on to attend the oral training and videoing skills courses too \(S6\). Indrani Krishan was impressed by the achievements of women: *“Each of them has different abilities, and they have accomplished their dream and stand as a woman”* and was pleased to extend her skillset: *“this event increases my knowledge of qualitative methods. As a PhD research student, I have learnt the techniques to conduct the focus group discussion, and it benefits me in the near future”* \(S5\). 

 <ins> **Augmenting Women’s Self\-esteem and Social Acknowledgement**</ins> 

 It was important to capture and record stories of women’s activism before these first\-hand accounts were lost forever. Acknowledging women’s rights campaigning and battles for local improvements has elevated the self\-esteem of older women, whose work traditionally took second place to men’s. Interviewee Pat Smith reflected upon her newly\-awoken comprehension of her working life in the context of the national picture of women battling sex discrimination in the workplace: *“This project \[...\] had a profound impact on me, a realisation of how far I have come personally and professionally since I first started work in 1977. \[...\] It has helped me to understand what discrimination means in the workplace and in life. It also made me feel very proud to be amongst other pioneering women, who lived in Portsmouth”* \(S5\).  The Project has had a broader impact too, as dispersed families have now understood, with great pride, the role played by their older female relatives. \[Text removed for publication\] noted: *“It has been great for my family \(living in different continents\) to celebrate our Mum’s story”* \(S6\). Such pride was especially clear in the ‘Testimonial Video’, which articulates how the Project empowered its participants \(S2\). 

 Interviewees have achieved recognition through autobiographical testimonies and understanding of their position in society. Rosy Bremer, a 1980s Greenham common activist, observed: *“the only other time I have spoken about the work I did \[...\] was when I was being prosecuted and sent to prison. \[...\] I would be happy to think that children growing up in Portsmouth might be able to learn about some of the reasons people might oppose the military's actions against people in other countries. These opinions are little represented in the city. \[...\] The project definitely benefited me by benefiting the community and the city in which I live. Stories which were previously known to only a few women now have a greater chance of being told and being heard”* \(S5\). 

 <ins> **Extending Awareness of Ethnic Diversity**</ins> 

 An unexpected but very welcome outcome of the project has been a hugely positive impact upon a number of minority groups in the Portsmouth area, including Chinese wives and Bangladeshi daughters \(S4\). The diversity of women’s lives and contributions in Portsmouth has achieved greater visibility, significance and acknowledgement. The testimony of Marie Costa, of the Nigerian Ebo people, chair of the Portsmouth African Women’s Forum, demonstrates how vital the collaborative nature of the project was to achieving this: *“At first, we thought that this project has ‘nothing’ for us \[...\] However, as the meetings continued over the two years, we realised that perhaps we had a contribution to make to the project as we have been trying to re\-shape Portsmouth to include women from Africa who \[...\] have enriched Portsmouth’s social, economic and cultural life.”* By contributing their life narratives, women from the African Women’s Forum gained a sense of belonging: *“With encouragement from the leaders of the Hidden Histories project, we began to feel part of it, enjoying the processes involved. We have grown in confidence, interacting with other women outside our comfort zone, learning their own achievements as well as verbalising our thoughts. Being recorded for the project, has made AWF members feel important and part of Portsmouth’s history.”* 

 Like other women, Marie Costa understands how the Project has enhanced the profile and standing of women in Portsmouth: *“I could not have envisaged the ultimate result and benefits of the project to members of African Women’s Forum – being involved in academic research, inclusion in the booklet written about Portsmouth’s Hidden History’ of activists women, names on plaque mounted in the centre of Portsmouth for posterity and the continuing building of positive relationship with our local University and City which we have come to call ‘Home’. We are thrilled \[...\]”* \(S5\). The significance of this engagement was marked by the unveiling of a Project\-inspired artwork celebrating participants’ autobiographies at the multicultural women’s group, ‘Chat over Chai’ on International Women’s Day, when attendees took pleasure in *“seeing their names and trying to find words they had used in their interviews”* \(S3\). 

 <ins> **Contributing to Wider Understanding of Women’s Activism**</ins> 

 This project has catalysed a shift in understanding and placed women’s pioneering action at the forefront of Portsmouth history. The project has impacted wider audiences of internationally\-recognised museums and educational charities. The Imperial War Museum’s ‘Connecting, Sharing, Learning’ project will access the interviews to engage audiences aged over 70 who have been restricted by COVID \(S8\).  The national women’s\-rights charity, FiLiA, was drawn to engage with the Portsmouth example through the project’s outcomes, and is now planning to hold its national conference in Portsmouth \(October 2021\): *“We were especially interested and excited to promote the archive. To have this accessible resource available to the public is a huge benefit to women and I’m sure will be used by women from a variety of backgrounds” \(*S10\). In October 2020 they recorded a podcast about the Project: *“Our Podcasts are \[...\] accessed by women across the globe. We typically get over 6,000 people accessing them \[...\] The connections made between women and the learning from the podcasts is \[...\] a way for Women’s voices to be heard. Our supporters tell us this \[...\] builds their knowledge and confidence in Women’s issues, history and rights”* \(S10\). 

 <ins> **Creating Enduring Memory**</ins> 

 Art remains an important form of feminist expression. Mandy Webb, activist and textile artist, was inspired to create a “Wall of Words”: *“As many of these women have protested at some time in their lives, I imagine they have made placards, they may even have painted graffiti, so I decided to put their own words in this style on the wall surrounding the plaque”* \(S3\). This was developed as a commemorative poster and reproduced in the project booklet \(S4\). In recognition of the project’s significance to the city, Portsmouth City Council is sponsoring a permanent bronze, inspired by Webb’s artwork, in the Guildhall Square as a lasting legacy.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 McVie and Murray’s work transformed the law, policy and practice of stop\-and\-search in Scotland. They achieved this by: \(i\) increasing parliamentary, governmental, organisational and public scrutiny; \(ii\) influencing major legislative reform \(Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Act 2016\), which abolished non\-statutory search; \(iii\) co\-producing a new Code of Practice; \(iv\) improving police recording; and \(v\) influencing widespread cultural change within Police Scotland, including the delivery of stop\-and\-search retraining to all officers. As a result, police now conduct fewer searches, more fairly and effectively, with greater success: between 2014/15 and 2018/19, recorded searches fell from 426,000 to 32,300 per annum. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 McVie and Murray conducted impactful research on the policing of young people and the use of stop\-and\-search in Scotland. That work has underpinned a continuous programme of collaboration and engagement with Police Scotland, the Scottish Government, the Scottish Police Authority \(SPA\) and HM Inspector of Constabulary \(HMICS\); and influenced the work of an Independent Advisory Group on Stop\-and\-Search \(IAGSS\). 

 A highly influential research report was published by Murray in 2014 \(3.1\), which uncovered serious problems with the use of police stop\-and\-search in Scotland, including: 

-  an absence of transparency and accountability, as marked by a lack of published data, research, scrutiny or public debate on the tactic; 

-  a dramatic growth in searches in the early 2000s, reaching 428,428 in 2010, despite a sharp drop in recorded crime; and 

-  search rates in Scotland that far exceeded those of more crime\-prone jurisdictions, including London and New York City \(3.2\). 

 Murray’s analysis identified a shift from ‘reactive’ to ‘pro\-active’ policing modes in some forces \(3.3\), underpinned by a performance culture and characterised by: 

-  higher \(and increasing\) search rates, compared to reactive forces; 

-  unfettered use of non\-statutory stop\-and\-search \(i.e. not based on suspicion or legislative powers\); 

-  very low detection rates, especially for non\-statutory searches; 

-  disproportionate and unchecked targeting of children and young people \(CYP\), in contrast to known offending patterns; and 

-  fixed numerical targets in some areas to drive up search rates, resulting in even greater reliance on non\-statutory searches, particularly amongst CYP. 

 Based on these findings, Murray recommended phasing out non\-statutory searches; reviewing police practice on and establishing guidelines for searching CYP; publishing stop and search data; and scrutinising police practice for proportionality. 

 McVie’s research formed the underpinning basis for significant concern about the pattern of usage of stop\-and\-search identified through Murray’s work. In particular, findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime had demonstrated that deprived CYP were disproportionately targeted using policing tactics such as stop\-and\-search, and this had demonstrable negative effects on their later involvement in offending and their likelihood of being convicted and imprisoned \(3.4\). 

 Following initially negative reactions to Murray’s work by Police Scotland and the Scottish Government \(3.5\), the findings subsequently led to a policy U\-turn and an extensive programme of reform. McVie and Murray produced a series of briefing papers and consultation responses for the IAGSS highlighting issues of concern around stop\-and\-search practice in Scotland. McVie also produced a number of unpublished briefing papers for the IAGSS, which highlighted ongoing problems with disproportionate patterns of stop\-and\-search across groups with protected characteristics and between geographical localities.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Published in January 2014, Murray’s research \(3.1\) generated enormous political and public debate. Her findings put stop\-and\-search on the political agenda, prompted parliamentary debate and gained widespread media attention, with stop\-and\-search referenced over 130 times in press reports in the 7 months following publication. The Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader raised Murray’s research in the Scottish Parliament and recommended changes to the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Bill to improve regulation of the practice \(5.1\). However, the research prompted a backlash from both Police Scotland and the Scottish Government. The Chief Constable denied Murray’s claims about a performance\-driven policing culture, despite documentary evidence and testimonials from police officers; and both the Justice Secretary \(Kenny MacAskill\) \(5.2\) and First Minister \(Alex Salmond\) \(5.3\) defended intensive stop\-and\-search, claiming its use was proportionate and had reduced violent crime in Scotland, despite a lack of evidence. 

 Formal reviews of Police Scotland’s stop\-and\-search processes were conducted by the Scottish Police Authority \(SPA\) in 2014 and by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland \(HMICS\) in 2015. Both concluded that greater transparency and regulation were needed. In March 2015, the Justice Secretary \(Michael Matheson\) established the IAGSS to consider legislative reform and whether a Code of Practice \(CoP\) was necessary. The IAGSS was chaired by John Scott QC and included representatives from Police Scotland, SPA, HMICS, Scottish Government and third sector organisations. McVie was also appointed a member. 

 In August 2015, the IAGSS presented recommendations to the Justice Secretary \(Matheson\), including proposals to abolish non\-statutory stop\-and\-search and introduce a CoP and extensively citing Murray and McVie’s research \(5.4\). McVie ensured that the IAGSS also recommended regular publication of stop\-and\-search data to improve transparency. The recommendations were fully accepted by the Cabinet Secretary and incorporated into Section 65 of the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Act 2016. The CoP was drafted by the IAGSS and implemented in May 2017, with McVie playing a leading role in aspects of its development. John Scott QC, IAGSS Chair, stated: *“Professor McVie was an integral member of the IAGSS at all stages of its work over a 4 year period. Concerns about stop and search received media and political attention because of analysis of data by academics. It was therefore crucial for the IAGSS to understand what that data meant…We could not have done this without Professor McVie’s expertise”* \(5.5.a\). 

 The IAGSS continued monitoring the use of stop\-and\-search and McVie played a critical role in this process with responsibility for providing research reviews on the implementation of the CoP for the Cabinet Secretary after 6 and 12 months \(5.5.a\-5.5.c\). Providing detailed analysis and scrutiny of the extent, nature, geographical patterning and proportionality of stop\-and\-search, McVie reported that recorded searches had reduced to 32,300 in 2017/18 – down 92% from 2014/15 \(5.5.b, 5.5.c\). The IAGSS used McVie’s reviews to make further recommendations for legislative amendments; for example, on the use of stop\-and\-search to remove alcohol from young people \(5.6\). 

 McVie and Murray’s work also contributed to increased scrutiny by SPA and HMICS, and the development of three Improvement Plans around stop\-and\-search through working closely with Police Scotland’s National Stop and Search Unit, of which the Head of Unit stated: *“\[T\]he work carried out by Professor McVie and Dr Murray…has without doubt, directly influenced and informed the significant improvements to the practice and policy of stop and search across Scotland”* \(5.7\). They created internal assurance metrics to monitor ‘proportionality, fairness and effectiveness’ \(5.8\), and produced a Data Analysis Reference Guide to support statistical analysis of stop\-and\-search data to determine whether it is being used fairly and effectively. The SPA Policing Committee commended these methods of improving data scrutiny and the accountability of Police Scotland in the use of such an intrusive and controversial tactic \(5.9\). 

 Introduction of the CoP required a major training programme for all Police Scotland officers \(approximately 15,000\). McVie and Murray contributed to its development and their research fed into the new Police Scotland Standard Operating Procedure. This training was instrumental in changing operational approaches – away from stop\-and\-search towards ‘stop and engage’ – and contributed to both cultural and normative transformation of police practice. 

 Despite criticism that the stop\-and\-search policy change would lead to a significant increase in violent crime, ongoing research indicates that this has not occurred. Police Scotland has stated that lessons learned throughout the stop\-and\-search improvement journey have informed its wider policing approach, especially around violence reduction, and provided a collaborative, preventative and evidence\-based focus across all policing priorities \(5.10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Since 2010 Urwin has led a series of innovative econometric studies of large government administrative datasets that identify positive evidence on the value of Further Education \(FE\) learning. Urwin’s engagement with policymakers has ensured prior survey\-based evidence has been recognised as undervaluing this learning. Resulting impacts include: 

-  Providing an evidence base that significantly informed the decision to suspend an anticipated 25% cut to the Adult Skills Budget \(a major source of funding for the FE sector\) in the 2015 Spending Review. 

-  Changing attitudes to FE learning and understanding of its role in social mobility among policymakers, such that a previously side\-lined sector is now being given strong backing by the government. 

-  Changing government data practice such that access to, and the sharing of, interdepartmental datasets is now widely used in Department for Education policymaking.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Previous research \(Dearden, McGranahan, Sianesi  [2004](http://cee.lse.ac.uk/ceedps/ceedp46.pdf); Dickerson & Vignoles  [2007](https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/8075/1/rrr21.pdf); Greenwood, Jenkins, Vignoles  [2007](http://cee.lse.ac.uk/ceedps/ceedp89.pdf)\) estimated that many individuals studying vocational qualifications at Level 2 and below \(particularly NVQ2 and NVQ1 qualifications\) secured zero or negative earnings returns \(gains\) from FE learning. 

 Prof Urwin’s programme of research has shown that the very focus of FE on helping the most disadvantaged was a key reason for an underestimation of returns in these survey\-based studies. Specifically, disadvantaged individuals are much more likely to select technical FE learning, and these individuals would receive a particularly low wage if they did not engage in this learning. Therefore the estimate of what they would have earned in the absence of, for instance, an NVQ2 \(the “counterfactual”\) needs to be particularly low. Unfortunately, to estimate this counterfactual, survey\-based studies used control groups that had much better labour market prospects, rendering the data and methods in survey studies insufficient. Survey\-based studies over\-estimated what FE learners would have earned in the absence of, for instance, an NVQ2 qualification, and therefore underestimated the returns \(observed minus counterfactual earnings\) to FE learning. 

 Urwin produced the evidence to support this argument through his leadership of a series of econometric investigations from 2010 onwards, using datasets that draw together administrative information from DWP \(Department for Work and Pensions\), HMRC \(HM Revenue and Customs\), BIS \(Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, now BEIS\) and DfE \(Department for Education\). 

 The starting point for this programme of investigation \[1\] used components of these admin datasets – specifically, linked NPD\-ILR\-WPLS – to create counterfactual estimates using the population of individuals who were seen to register for, for instance, an NVQ2 as their highest learning aim, but did not achieve the qualification. Such “non\-achievers” may be seen as a more appropriate control group in this context, in that they are “the sort of individual who takes this qualification as a highest learning aim”. This approach, which was only possible with admin data, estimated positive impacts of lower\-level vocational learning that were diametrically opposed to those in survey\-based studies. 

 However, this was only a first step and at this point it was possible that if non\-achievement was occurring because of illness, family breakdown or other negative \(one\-off\) impacts, then artificially low counterfactual estimates would result. A subsequent report \[2\] applied Coarsened Exact Matching \(CEM\) with difference\-in\-differences, together with additional dissections of the data. The results of this study further re\-enforced the possibility that Urwin was uncovering value added that had been hidden to those using survey datasets. 

 Though it was increasingly unlikely that higher estimated impacts were a result of non\-achievers experiencing one\-off negative impacts, Urwin and colleagues refined their approaches across two further projects \[3\] \[4\]; and recently published the most compelling evidence to date for the validity of favourable estimated returns to FE learning \[5\]. These latter studies of admin data \(ILR\-WPLS\-LMS\-ND\) are able to use two control groups to create counterfactual outcomes \(both non\-achievers, as in previous studies, and more “traditional” untreated comparison groups\); and in \[5\] the CEM approach \(matching on extensive employment and learning histories\) is adopted within a dynamic evaluation framework that investigates the possibility that selection into non\-achievement / achievement is driven by unobservable factors, using distance to training provider as an instrumental variable.

#  Avoiding Cuts to the Adult Skills Budget in the 2015 Spending Review 

 The previous survey\-based research in this area underpinned the headline statement of the *Review of Vocational Education: The Wolf Report* \(2011\): “Among 16 to 19 year olds, the Review estimates that at least 350,000 \[per year\] get little to no benefit from the post\-16 education system” \[a\-i, p.7\]. This set the tone for policy debate, with Further Education \(FE\) seen to be failing disadvantaged young people due to the poor value delivered by its provision of technical qualifications. This made the sector a target for budget cuts, with the Chancellor having told government departments to expect reductions of between 25 and 40 per cent in the November 2015 Spending Review \[a\-ii\]. Given the broader context of austerity, professional organisations such as the Association of Colleges expected the Spending Review to make a 25% cut to the Adult Skills Budget that supports FE learning \[a\-iii\]. 

 However, Prof Urwin’s direct engagement with BIS/DWP \(including commissioned research resulting in outputs \[1\] to \[4\]\) and a range of other key stakeholders, as well as his advocacy in policy discussions with HM Treasury, overturned this perception among policymakers. This led to the retention of the full Adult Skills budget in the 2015 Spending Review. The Chancellor’s Autumn Statement on 25th November 2015 stated that: “We will not, as many predicted, cut core adult skills funding for FE colleges – we will instead protect it in cash terms”, adding: “We will maintain the current national base rate of funding for our 16 to 19\-year\-old students for the whole Parliament” \[a\-iv\]. In cash terms this was **the retention of an Adult Skills budget of £1.5 billion, avoiding anticipated cuts of £375m** \[a\-v, p.18\]. This key impact was achieved through Urwin’s undertaking of innovative research and his translation of its findings for key stakeholders, as described below. 

 Publication of outputs \[1\], \[2\] and \[4\] had already occurred prior to the 2015 Spending Review and began to impact significantly on attitudes to FE and the understanding of its role in social mobility across academic, policy, and practice communities through direct engagement that included: Urwin and Cerqua’s presentation of their research in June 2015 to a large audience of academics and policymakers at InstEAD \(Sheffield Univeristy\), which featured lively debate with audience members Prof Dearden and Baroness Wolf \[b\-i\]; a July presentation to *The 157 Group* \(now Collab Group\) *,* a UK network of 35 colleges and college groups of FE \[b\-ii\], and an October presentation to the *Federation of Awarding Bodies,* the British trade association for the qualification and assessment industry \[b\-iii\]. 

 Further policy pressure was created by a September 2015 *Times Educational Supplement* \(TES\) article that detailed the findings of these outputs, challenged the previous evidence flagged in the Wolf Report, and included a comment from **Baroness Wolf herself recognising Urwin’s research findings as important to reversing the poor perception of FE**: “If we are now finally getting some concrete proof that shows low\-level qualifications do bring some benefits, then that’s a good thing, and not before time” \[b\-iv\]. This was followed on 13<sup>th</sup> November by a further TES article \[b\-v\] detailing the evidence provided by output \[4\]. 

 In regard to government itself, Frank Bowley, Head of Further Education Data and Analysis at DfE, confirms “Urwin worked closely with the FE Skills team to ensure that this overturning of previous estimates provided a robust evidence base, \[which\] **stimulated the FE Skills Team’s policy position**” \[c\-i\]. Bowley adds that: “In a series of briefings and meetings with HM Treasury, Urwin explained why these new findings were a significant improvement on previous estimates and that a cutting of support to FE was not consistent with a policy goal of improving social mobility” \[c\-i\]. 

 Output \[3\] was not formally published until Dec 2015, so drafts were shared internally with relevant government policymakers and Prof Urwin began delivering a series of cross\-departmental seminars from April 2015 detailing both the published \(outputs \[1\] \[2\]\) and emerging \[3\] research evidence \[c\-ii to c\-v\]. From August 2015 to October 2015, Urwin and Cerqua engaged in detailed discussions with HM Treasury to present and defend these findings; showing clearly that these new favourable estimates were much more robust than previous survey\-based estimates and making the argument that, as this evidence showed FE is an important ladder of opportunity for disadvantaged young people, government policy priorities on social mobility would be contravened if cuts were made to its budget \[c\-vi & c\-vii\]. 

 Of the ongoing impact achieved through Urwin’s interventions, Bowley states: “ **Avoiding these expected cuts had significant social and economic impacts.** It ensured that disadvantaged young people and the unemployed could maintain access to valuable vocational learning within FE at level 2 and below. These are levels of learning that we expect of the average school leaver at KS4 \[Key Stage 4\] and removal of support for these courses would have removed an important ‘second chance’ for many disadvantaged people. This work continues to have significance in terms of **changing the context and policy discourse around FE in government,** with a greater recognition of its value to all learners, and especially disadvantaged young people” \[b\-vi\]. 

#  Changing Policy Attitudes to FE and the Understanding of its Role in Social Mobility 

 Prof Urwin’s research and engagement activities in the run\-up to the 2015 Spending Review, and subsequent to this, have helped change the nature of policy debate on FE, resulting in the ongoing impact of repositioning FE as a key component of social mobility within UK policy circles. 

 Further to Bowley’s testimony above, Lord Willetts, former Minister for Universities and Science \(2010\-2014\) and current President of the Resolution Foundation’s Advisory Council and Intergenerational Centre, writes: “Previous evidence suggested little or no earnings return to qualifications gained at this level. That earlier literature had a big influence on how we saw things in the Coalition, appearing to show little value for level 2 NVQs for example. However Professor Urwin and his colleagues tried to allow for the prior disadvantage of many students doing these courses. This led to more favourable findings and has transformed understanding of the vocational qualifications delivered by FE. It is leading to **a reshaping of the agenda for FE and showing its important role in providing opportunities for many disadvantaged young people and boosting social mobility**” \[d\-i\]. 

 This change in perception of FE within government policymaking is evident in The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission’s December 2015 *State of the Nation 2015: Social Mobility and Child Poverty in Great Britain* report, which cites output \[2\] to highlight “that those in possession of Level 2 qualifications are much less likely to be out of work” and the need for “ensuring that funding for Level 1 and Level 2 course provision can be protected” \[d\-ii, p.163\], and, more recently, by the May 2019 Augar review \( *Post\-18 review of education and funding: independent panel report*\), which similarly drew on Urwin’s research to make this case \[d\-iii\]. The Augar review draws on output \[2\] to “show that full Level 2 qualifications yield some of the highest increases in earnings” \[d\-iii, p.124\] and also increase such learners’ “chance of being in employment by 2 percentage points \(based on 3\-5 year averages after achievement\), compared to those that do not achieve the qualification” \[d\-iii, p.53\]. On the basis of the positive estimates produced by Urwin and colleagues, and in response to the decline in post\-18s undertaking such qualifications \(from 400,000 in 2012/13 to just over 50,000 in 2017/18\), Augar “make\[s\] proposals to reverse these trends and create a clear educational route for adults wishing to study and train at Levels 2 and 3” \[d\-iii, p.49\]. Such proposals include the reformation of the currently complex FE funding rules and the removal of tuition fees, at a cost of £500m \[d\-iii, p.54, 123, 204\]. 

 The government’s December 2020 announcement of an investment of £375 million into the Lifetime Skills Guarantee \(LSG\) continues to evidence the marked policy shift towards significantly resourcing FE learning \[d\-iv\]. The Prime Minister’s LSG announcement explicitly responds to how the “Augar review highlighted the complexity of the funding system” – i.e. as a barrier to achieving the gains evidenced by Urwin, as above – by “mov\[ing\] to a system where every student will have a flexible lifelong loan entitlement to four years of post\-18 education” \[d\-iv\]. Urwin further fed into the attainment of this impact via the DfE. The DfE’s September 2020 written evidence for the Education Select Committee *Inquiry into Adult Skills and Lifelong Learning* prominently cites Urwin’s work \(outputs \[2\] and \[3\]\) to evidence that “adult skills and lifelong learning also has significant positive labour market impacts for its learners” \[d\-v\]. The positive returns found in this work and presented to parliament are thus an important reason for the continuing emphasis on lower\-level vocational qualifications by policymakers. 

#  Developing Government Data Practice 

 As part of the 2011\-12 contracts that produced some of the first positive estimates of value added from FE learning \(\[1\] and \[2\]\), BIS commissioned the team led by Prof Urwin to begin creation of a production standard version of the ILR\-WPLS *Database*. This enabled BIS – and now DfE – to embed a variety of analytical and reporting functions within an updatable database for use in policymaking. 

 This work was an essential proof of concept in the process of developing the analysis of administrative data across government and has had the longer\-term institutional impact of **changing government practice in regard to its use of databases**. Used from 2013 to 2016, Anthony Harris, Lead Data Scientist at the DfE confirms: “Prior to this \[intervention by Urwin’s team\], use of ILR\-WPLS admin data for this purpose was in its infancy, and whilst there had been some analysis, different approaches had been adopted to data manipulation and this was the first time that” such a database “could easily integrate regular updates of HMRC\-DWP data” \[e\-i\]. This was enabled through the building of this integrated relational *Database* in the MS SQL Server, such that it linked data sourced from HMRC, DWP, BIS and HESA – including P14 earnings data, benefits records, P45 employment data and further learning in Higher Education undertaken by FE learners. Harris describes how this change in practice “optimised the use of limited staff resource; and **began the development of processes for sharing that would allow secondary analysis by government departments, academics and others**” \[e\-i\]. In regard to FE, the *Database* helped elucidate “the new more favourable estimated returns to FE learning \[which\] have been used extensively to underpin CBA \[cost\-benefit analysis\] estimates across DfE \(and publications such as the FE Skills Index\)” \[e\-i\]. 

 Having developed governmental data practice, Harris confirms that the ILR\-WPLS *Database* “was **an important precursor for Longitudinal Education Outcomes \(LEO\), which was launched in 2016 and is now widely used in policy making across the whole of DfE**” \[e\-i\]. The LEO now provides regularly updated CBA figures, which are calculated using the original “work of Urwin and colleagues \[who\] developed a new approach to estimation” \[e\-i\]. This work continues to form a crucial part of the DfE evidence base, and findings using LEO and these calculations are regularly cited in inquiries and committees – for instance, in the DfE’s aforementioned submission to the December 2020 *Adult Skills and Lifelong Learning* inquiry, which featured as its centre\-piece an FE “returns table” produced using both \[d\-v\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 A cluster of collaborative research programmes, led by Professor Christopher Day at the University of Nottingham, has been instrumental in improving school leadership practices, organisational strategies, and teachers’ effectiveness, through the incorporation of his research on the design and delivery of national and local training programmes, and through informing educational policy formation in the context of current political and economic challenges in the UK and internationally. Day’s work has engaged with multiple local, national and international stakeholders concerned with raising education standards at different system levels. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** 

 Day’s main research aims are: i\) **increasing understandings** of the intersections between schoolteachers’ and leaders’ work and lives \(R1,2,3\), and ii\) **influencing practice** by narrowing the knowledge gap between university academics and school practitioners \(R4,5,6\). His theoretical, applied, and collaborative research has made a distinctive contribution to knowledge of the complex associations between external moderating \(demographics and policy changes\), internal mediating \(school conditions, leadership, structures and cultures\), and individual factors, and school improvement phases. This is key to understanding successful change leadership and teacher quality. His research has found significant and qualitatively authentic associations between levels of teachers’ commitment and resilience in different career phases, and their perceived and measurable effectiveness in classrooms, and revealed the context\-sensitive, direct and indirect contributions of principals to sustained school improvement. This work has impacted on the design of leadership development programmes supporting successful leadership practices across the world, and to policies regarding schools’ improvement phases \(R1,5\). In 2016, Day was the first UK lead author to be awarded the prestigious **William J Davies Prize \(**established 1979\) for the best annual leadership research paper \(R4\). 

 Between 2012 and 2019, Day conceptualised a set of related research projects on effective school principalship and co\-led these with Gu. G1 \(funded by the Catholic Diocese of Parramatta\) is a rare longitudinal empirical analysis of system\-led change internationally. It investigated **system\-led reform of the leadership and teaching and learning in 89 schools in Australia**. G2 \(the Association of Independent Schools\) investigated the contextual school influences during an **innovative and sustained professional learning change programme**. G3 \(ESRC\) focused on **how the intended outcomes of educational reforms are mediated by school leaders and teachers in a diverse range of successful secondary schools in England and Hong Kong** \(R5\). G4 \(ESRC\) was a schools\-university knowledge exchange project with **principals of schools serving disadvantaged urban communities**. G5 \(DfE\) examined **systemic and school level factors in England which were likely to attract, retain or lose teachers** \(R3\). 

 Day has continued to direct the **International Successful School Principalship Project \(ISSPP**, see E\) **.** Founded by Day in 2001, ISSPP focuses on **the impact of successful leadership in schools in different socio\-economic contexts within and between 27 countries**. This work has identified, for the first time, how successful school principals, in different policy and cultural contexts internationally, integrate generic sets of values, qualities and skills through the combination, accumulation and application of contextually sensitive strategies across school development phases, to achieve success \(R1\). Furthermore, Day’s pioneering research has differentiated ‘success’ from ‘effectiveness’ and challenged the authenticity of single lens leadership ‘models’. Since 2013, the ISSPP agenda has been expanded to include two additional strands: i\) principalship in visible and invisible under\-performing schools and ii\) principals’ identities. The ISSPP network has developed **the world’s largest number of international case studies,** and has **resulted in over 100 academic outputs** since its inception \(see E\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Since 2013, Day has acted as **a** **consulting expert on school leadership for various** **policy\-making and professional organisations** \(such as the DfE, England; CONICYT \[Commision National de Investigation Cientifica Tecnologica, Government of Chile\]; and the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership\). He is currently a Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees of Education Support \(ES\), a national charity supporting the mental health and wellbeing of all educators in the UK. He has served as a Director/Trustee of White Hills Park School Federation Trust \(WHPFT\) in Nottingham, where he has advised on the delivery of services that improved schools’ performance, through his Chairing of the Academic Achievement and Standards Committee \(2014\-2018\). He is currently a Trustee of the Djanogly Learning Trust, and Chair of its Achievement, Standards and Wellbeing Committee. The major impacts associated with Day’s research and advisory work are presented in the below paragraphs. 

 **Shaping education policy** 

 Day’s research on successful school leadership \(R1, 2, 3, 4, 5\) has informed policy debate and reforms in **England**. In 2017, DfE implemented new guidance on headteacher recruitment in England, informed by Day’s research \(A1\). Its 2010 National Leaders of Education standards cite Day’s work several times, acknowledging that: *“Drawing on their \[Day et al., R4\] significant experiences of school improvement, NLEs will develop the capabilities of the supported leader”* \(A2, p.4\). 

 Through his work as Vice\-Chair of the Trustees of Education Support, Day has contributed to policy discussions with both DfE and the Department of Health, and unions and mental health charities. A range of these actors now engage in an ES\-led policy forum, the ‘Research and Development Wellbeing’ Group, which Day established \(B\). 

 At an **international** level, Day’s research \(R6, G2\) and advisory work with the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership \(since 2013\) has fed into the Australian national policy guidelines on “Leading for impact” \(C1\), and the “Western Australia school leadership strategy” \(C2\). 

 ISSPP has contributed to successful school principalship becoming a priority in educational policy agendas and more widely \(D\). For instance, in 2015 research from the ISSPP network was cited in response to a Government inquiry on the role of pedagogical leadership of headteachers on the quality and development of school operations in Sweden: *“There is evidence that this Governmental inquiry, which used ISSPP research …, has led to incremental changes in the way politicians and school leaders’ practice and talk about their work.”*. Moreover, the ISSPP research results have been described as *“central”* for the Swedish Government’s Reform project “Cooperation for Better Schools”, following this inquiry \(D\). In Norway, ISSPP findings received substantial public attention and were cited in several governmental Green and White papers between 2015 and 2017 \(D\). 

 **Optimising organisational strategy, services, and outcomes** 

 In **Nottingham**, Day has worked with academy trusts \(G3\-5\) to develop programmes to support effective leadership and schools improvement \(G, H\): *“As a direct result of our work with  Professor Day, we have significantly improved the quality of teaching … Professor Day has a significant impact on the strategy of the schools used to raise standards. One of the huge achievements is that students’ rate of Maths at the Bramcote School increased by 24% from 2014 to 2018”*. Two of the schools *“…have improved Ofsted … rating from “Requires Improvement” in 2014/15 to “Good” in 2017”* \(H\). 

 In **England**, Day’s research has also directly impacted upon the work of Education Support: *“… \[his\] role for \(re\)shaping the strategy and, consequently, the services provided by ES\(P\) is key”* \(B\). Between 2018 and 2019 alone, in addition to the provision of other services to over 600 educational organisations, the charity’s helpline received around 10,000 calls from education workers, around 90% of whom were teachers in primary and secondary education. 

 **Internationally**, Day’s work has had a significant influence on successful school leadership strategies in educational organisations \(D, E\). Research project G1 *“…informed 2020 CEDP Priorities which are the basis of all system guidelines and policy particularly in relation to the support of Learning in schools”* \(I\). In response to G2, the AIS: *“… redefined the concept of ‘middle leadership’ and reshaped our approach to ‘working 'in' the middle’ through a series of initiatives involving both the program leaders and participants”* that prompted the improvement in the AIS’s leadership programme, which *“…has, consequently, led to positive changes in teacher skill\-sets and school leadership practice”* \(F, R6\). The Arizona Initiative for Leadership Development and Research drew on ISSPP’s work to make improvements in student outcomes in its 75 supported schools: *“…in the first iteration of the project from 2013\-15, 57% of participating schools improved student outcomes in school labels. In the second iteration from 2015\-2017, over 80% of participating schools made these gains in student outcomes”* \(D\). 

 **Enriching individuals’ capacities and practices** 

 In **Nottingham**, Day’s work with the Transform Trust has centred on a schools\-university knowledge exchange project across eight schools serving disadvantaged urban communities \(G, G4\). This led to better practices in teaching and learning. School principals report staff have increased their knowledge post\-training, implemented the newly learned skills into their work, and become more efficient in their day\-to\-day practice \(J\). Day also facilitated collaborative projects between the White Hills Park Federation Trust and schools from Australia and China. This, in turn, enhanced the professional development of \(head\)teachers and subsequently improved teaching and leadership practice \(H\). 

 **Internationally**, his work with the Australian Association of Independent Schools led to improvements in its training programme and subsequent outcomes: *“…approximately 60 participants in the programme have…been greatly influenced by Professor Day’s work and research. …approximately 10% per cent… have subsequently been promoted to senior leadership roles. … their professional identities had changed by the end of the programme”* \(I\). 

 ISSPP activities have laid the foundations of sustainable school leadership improvement through new research\-informed programmes internationally \(D, E\), with *“… multi\-levels of impact, including improved skill levels and career development of academic members, development and implementation of new educational programmes, and improved teaching practices”* \(D\). Highlights include influence on the Swedish National Principal Training Programme and new higher degrees in Australia, Mexico, Norway and USA, which have educated thousands of professionals to date \(D\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Since 2015, Dr Harmonie Toros’s research has: \(1\) transformed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s \(NATO\) practice in training military and defence officials in counter\-terrorism by directly changing NATO’s curriculum to include non\-violent responses; and, \(2\) introduced new approaches and frameworks for analysing terrorism and counter\-terrorism now adopted within NATO centres. 

 Through the co\-production of policy reports and advisory roles, Toros’s research has also \(3\) contributed to the framing of the Federal Government of Somalia’s and the United Nations Mission in Somalia’s response to non\-state armed group, al\-Shabaab, introducing non\-violent responses to the armed group, including high\-level defections and direct negotiations. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Mainstream counter\-terrorism policy rejects the possibility of negotiations with groups labelled as ‘terrorists’. Toros’s research directly challenges this approach. Toros has developed a theoretically grounded framework on whether and how negotiations can be used as a response to terrorist violence. The framework is based on rare primary research, including interviews and participant observation with members of non\-state armed groups and senior government and military officials in Somalia, Mali, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. 

 Crucially, her research outputs have consistently been policy accessible, enabling military, defence, and political affairs officials of states and international organisations to easily see the relevance of the research to their policy needs – from establishing frameworks for new policy, to mapping concrete implementation, to training new generations of policy leaders. 

 Toros has published 10 articles in top\-ranked specialist journals \(including *Security Dialogue, International Studies Perspectives, Critical Studies on Terrorism*\), one single\-authored monograph, two edited volumes, and seven book chapters with top\-rated publishers \(including Oxford University Press\). Her publications were the first to develop a critical theory\-based understanding of terrorism and offer a comprehensive investigation of whether and how negotiations can provide an effective pathway out of terrorism that avoids the excessive violence of common state counter\-terrorism responses. 

 Her **2012** single\-authored monograph, *Terrorism, Talking and Transformation: A Critical Approach*, was one of the first to offer an in\-depth study of negotiations in contexts of terrorism **\[R1\]**. Praised by leading peace scholar Prof. Roger MacGinty as theoretically ‘sophisticated’, it challenges mainstream arguments against negotiations with terrorist groups – that they undermine state legitimacy and incite more violence – and boldly argues that negotiations with al Qaeda\-linked groups are a policy option that has the potential to transform conflicts and reduce violence. The monograph investigates the understudied case of successful negotiations with armed groups in the southern Philippines **\[R2\]** and establishes a critical theory\-based framework that remains one of the main alternative approaches to understanding terrorism. 

 The monograph was followed by a special issue in **2013** and an edited volume in **2015**, both co\-edited by Toros \(50% each\), which brought together leading scholars, practitioners, and policy\-makers involved in negotiations in terrorist conflicts **\[R3, R4\]**. These collections offer original research into a variety of conflicts \(Colombia, Syria, Iraq, Basque country\) and innovative theoretical and practical approaches to negotiations.Toros has also produced scholarship that clearly lays out how critical approaches to terrorism can inform state and international policy in counter\-terrorism **\[R5\]**. 

 These publications and presentations based on this research prompted senior NATO officials to invite her in 2015 to join the rota of lecturers for the principal NATO courses in counter\-terrorism, followed by the commissioning of co\-produced policy reports with NATO and the United Nations, and a high\-level secondment. These collaborations have led to further co\-produced research outputs, including a co\-authored \(50%\) book chapter published in **2018** investigating the increasingly salient question of whether the conflict in Somalia can be addressed through negotiations with al\-Shabaab **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Broadening NATO’s Core Defence Against Terrorism Training Curriculum** 

 Toros’s work has had significant and far\-reaching international impact on counter\-terrorism training. Her collaboration with NATO’s Centre of Excellence\-Defence Against Terrorism \(COE\-DAT\) in Ankara \(Turkey\), the NATO School in Oberammergau \(Germany\), and on NATO’s Mobile Training Courses since **2015** led to a direct change in the core curriculum of NATO’s Defence Against Terrorism courses **\[a, b, c\]**. These weeklong courses are attended every year by approximately 100 military and defence officials at the NATO School, 45 students at COE\-DAT, and some 30 students on the Mobile Training Courses. As the NATO School Course Director attested: ‘Negotiations with terrorist groups had not been taught at the school prior to your involvement with the teaching and curriculum development. These courses gather military and civilian defence officials from NATO and partner countries who then bring back their newly\-acquired knowledge to their home countries and institutions’ **\[b\]**. Toros has also delivered the conceptual lecture on terrorism from **2015 to 2020**, enabling her to introduce officials to critical approaches to terrorism hitherto overlooked in the courses **\[c\]**. 

 **Shaping NATO’s Framing and Research Practices on Terrorism** 

 Toros’s ongoing collaboration with NATO units has also directly influenced NATO policy\-makers, broadening their frameworks of understanding terrorism to include non\-violent responses and strengthening their analysis of terrorist threats and appropriate CT responses **\[e, g\]**. The Head of NATO’s Counter\-Terrorism Unit described Toros’s contribution as ‘extremely helpful and of considerable value to NATO’s work on Counter\-Terrorism’, adding that it has prompted them ‘to consider the wider CT spectrum rather than the narrow, kinetic military aspect’ **\[d\]**. This was carried out through the co\-production of policy reports \( **2015**, **2019**, **2020**\) and a high\-level secondment in **2019**, both funded by NATO. Based on their knowledge of Toros’s research, COE\-DAT commissioned Toros for a report on conflict resolution approaches to terrorism that examines NATO’s potential role in reducing conflict **\[e\]**. NATO units and national governments have widely used this report to develop counter\-terrorism policy **\[h\]** and to produce research reports on specific terrorist conflicts for NATO in the Sahel **\[f\]**. 

 Following this work, NATO’s newly established Southern Hub invited Toros to be the first ever seconded academic working with its Comprehensive Research and Analysis Section \(CRAS\) from **April to July 2019** **\[g\]**. There, Toros introduced 20 analysts to research frameworks that integrate terrorism into broader social and political conflicts and to non\-violent responses to terrorism **\[g\]**. Most importantly, Toros was the lead on CRAS’s first ever policy report based on primary research \(interviews, primary data collection\) on informal governance of non\-state armed groups in the Sahel **\[f\]**. The project’s conclusions were co\-produced with the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre \(Ghana\), the African Union’s African Centre for Study and Research on Terrorism \(ACSRT\), the AU’s mission in the Sahel \(MISAHEL\), and the United Nations Mission in Mali \(MINUSMA\). 

 **Developing Somalia’s and the United Nations’ Response to al\-Shabaab** 

 Since 2017, Toros’s publications **\[R1, R6, and e\]** and advisory role have been directly used in developing and delivering the Somali government’s High Level Defector programme, aimed at convincing senior leaders of al\-Shabaab, one of the largest non\-state armed groups in Africa, to defect. The HLD strategy document cites four of Toros’s publications, and the CT Presidential Advisor, who supported the Somali government in designing and carrying out the programme, described Toros’s work as ‘tremendously helpful in developing the High\-Level Defector \(HLD\) project implementation documents, providing us with a theory of conflict resolution, useful case studies and an incredibly thorough bibliography. The resultant project framework shows the direct influence of Dr Toros’s work’ **\[h\]**. 

 Toros acted as an advisor to the Somali government in **2018** and **2019**, and ‘provided ongoing mentoring and insight in support of the HLD project and has also travelled to Somalia and the wider East African region to explore the possibilities for High Level Negotiated Settlement at the organizational level with al\-Shabaab’ **\[h\]**. This work also informed the United Nations Mission in Somalia’s \(UNSOM\) understanding and approach to al\-Shabaab. Specifically, UNISOM commissioned a co\-authored policy paper \(with Harley – 50%\) on prospects for negotiations with the group **\[R6\]**. This was presented at a UNSOM workshop in Mogadishu in **February 2018**, where Toros presented the option of negotiations with al\-Shabaab to Somalia’s Interior Minister, MPs, senior advisors to the President and Prime Minister, the United Nations Special Representative, and the ambassadors of major donor countries. Her presentation forms the basis of, and is directly cited in, UNISOM’s current plan to build a ‘community of practice’ on the question of engagement with al\-Shabaab **\[i\]**.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Attribution: University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) researchers pioneered an approach to explore the rheology of caramel, a complex, multi\-component food inhabiting a multi\-dimensional parameter space, interpreting the data using their expertise in colloidal aggregation and polymer dynamics. A similar approach was then used to understand why the rheology of gluten\-free dough often led to instability in baking, and how this could be alleviated. 

 Impact: Working with a Scottish company, *Genius Gluten Free Ltd.*, UoE researchers quantified how different ingredients affected dough stability \[text removed for publication\]. 

 Beneficiaries: As well as helping the company remain one of the top gluten\-free providers in the UK and grow its world market, the collaboration has resulted in products of more consistent quality for *Genius*’ gluten\-free customers. 

 Significance and reach: \[text removed for publication\] The company is a pioneer of the fresh gluten\-free bread market, and the partnership with UoE has helped them remain a top brand within an increasingly competitive market.

 2. Underpinning research 

 Soft matter physics studies colloids, polymers, and surfactants. Most food ingredients are soft matter, as are most foods in the form in which they are consumed. Soft matter physicists have therefore long been associated with food research. Two strands of UoE’s soft matter physics research underpin our work with *Genius Gluten Free Ltd*. 

 First, many soft matter systems are viscoelastic: their flow and deformation show characteristics of both viscous liquids and elastic solids. Prof Morozov is a world\-leading expert in the flow instabilities of viscoelastic materials. A famous example is the melt\-fracture phenomenon observed in the extrusion of concentrated polymer solutions or melts. In this process, the liquid is pressed through a thin capillary to produce a regular jet of material. At low extrusion speeds the jet remains straight and homogeneous, while at larger speeds the flow starts undulating, becomes chaotic and eventually breaks up. These instabilities are one of the main production\-limiting factors and have been plaguing industry for years. Morozov was the first to propose \[ **R1**\] that these phenomena are linked to a sub\-critical instability leading directly to so\-called ‘purely elastic turbulence’ – a chaotic flow state observed in viscoelastic materials at low Reynolds numbers. He teamed up with the experimental group of Professor Arratia \(UPenn, USA\) to convincingly establish this connection \[ **R2**\]. This expertise helped pinpoint a key flow instability in gluten\-free dough. 

 Secondly, soft matter physicists studying food typically investigate single ingredients, e.g., how one milk protein forms gels under heating. Sometimes, binary mixtures of ingredients are also tackled. However, real foods with 3 or more components are usually considered too complicated for physicists. In a key paper \[ **R3**\], Prof Poon demonstrates how the physics approach can nevertheless be used to reveal surprising simplicity in a complex food system. Central to this approach was the idea of ‘subtractive formulation’ – stripping the caramel to just the essential ingredients, *but no simpler*. This still left a four\-component composition space \(water, sugars, proteins, fats\) to be navigated to ‘tune’ the properties of the product. 

 Poon measured the response of a range of caramels within this composition space to mechanical oscillation at various frequencies. The real and imaginary parts of the response function were found to scale into a single pair of universal curves spanning 13 orders of magnitude in frequency. Importantly, these curves were identical to those of filled polymers, a well\-known class of soft matter that includes rubber strengthened by nanoparticles. Their conclusion is that changing any of the many parameters in making caramel in effect only ‘tunes’ two underlying parameters controlling the caramel’s flow properties: a fundamental relaxation time and a cross\-linking density of denatured proteins. Poon and Weir also established regions within their four\-dimensional ‘ingredient space’ in which caramel preparation failed, linking the failure modes to physical phenomena such as percolation. Their results mean that manufacturers can optimise new or existing recipes rationally rather than through trial and error. The approach exemplified in this study of caramel rheology \[ **R3**\] was subsequently adapted by UoE researchers to study the rheology of gluten\-free dough and isolate the effect of different ingredients \[text removed for publication\].

 4. Details of the impact 

 Moving from caramel to instabilities in GF bread 

 
 **Figure 1:** The Genius Food brand and their fresh, sliced, gluten\-free loaf. 

Gluten intolerance is widespread, with coeliac disease affecting 1% of the European population \[ **I1**\]. Historically, gluten\-free \(GF\) bread was hard, dense and dry, and eaten only out of necessity. Lucinda Bruce\-Gardyne, FRSE, founded *Genius* in 2008 after creating the first fresh white and brown GF sliced loaves equalling mainstream wheat bread in quality and cost \(Figure 1\). The company now sells over 25 products worldwide, developed and manufactured mostly in Bathgate, Scotland, with an annual turnover of GBP34,000,000 \[ **I2**\]. 

 *Genius* learned about the above\-mentioned UoE expertise when their Research Manager met UoE’s Dr Keith Bromley at a food\-science conference. Subsequent discussions with the company suggested to both parties that the approach used in \[ **R3**\] to study complex foods could be adapted to solve a long\-standing problem: the instability of GF dough. Excluding gluten from dough dramatically increases its sensitivity to small variations in recipe or processing conditions: a 5g difference to one ingredient in a 2kg GF bread mix makes the difference between a high\-quality loaf and a holey, crumbling one \(Figure 2\). Such sensitivity drives up costs for the company and lowers product consistency for the consumer. 

 The overwhelming majority of the literature on wheat dough emphasizes gluten’s elastic properties, and the GF literature typically discusses how to replace the elasticity lost due to the absence of gluten. Drawing on previous experience with polymer flow instabilities in confined spaces \[ **R1, R2**\], the UoE team rapidly homed in on a different issue. \[text removed for publication\]. 

 Guided by previous experience in developing a model caramel using the ‘subtractive formulation’ approach, the team developed a model GF dough, which allowed them to test rapidly the effect of various ingredients \[text removed for publication\].

 Mentorship for University of Edinburgh entrepreneurs 

 As a result of the UoE\- *Genius* collaboration, a productive working relationship was established between the University and the company’s founder, Lucinda Bruce\-Gardyne. This led to a successful application to the Royal Society to appoint her as the Entrepreneur in Residence within the School of Physics and Astronomy \(2018–20\). Bruce\-Gardyne’s work has created an outward\-facing, entrepreneurial culture amongst the School’s early\-career researchers \(ECRs\), and has expanded their ambition beyond academic work at a crucial stage of their career. Bruce\-Gardyne has organised 32 master classes \[ **I5**\] \(average attendance of 25, mostly ECRs\) in which a diverse range of speakers, many of whom are physicists\-turned\-entrepreneurs, have imparted their experience of moving from research to business. Bruce\-Gardyne has also provided mentoring to ECRs who have successfully started three companies \[ **I6**\]: Dyneval, a company using specialised microscopy to characterise particle dynamics, initially focussing on animal sperm motility for fertility applications \[ **I7**\]; QuestPair, which specialises in matching academic experts with companies \[ **I8**\]; and InVed, a company using patented technology to create environmentally\-friendly personal care products \[ **I9**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 As a global community of NGOs, policymakers, businesses and modern slavery survivors work to achieve the United Nations \(UN\) Sustainable Development Goal \(SDG 8.7\) of ending modern slavery by 2030, Trodd’s research puts modern slavery survivor voices at the heart of antislavery efforts. The result has been improvements in the quality of antislavery policies and practices. For example, Trodd’s research has shaped the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery at the inter\-governmental level; the strategies and programmes of multiple NGOs; and the national policies and frameworks of the UK Home Office and the Care Quality Commission. The three key impacts have been to i\) establish the policy value of survivor narratives with key stakeholders; ii\) influence policymaking and iii\) achieve changes in NGO practice including support for the development of the first survivor\-led NGO that empowers survivors to be antislavery leaders. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 As part of an AHRC\-funded project \( **6**\), Trodd’s research focused on the historical importance of survivor self\-representation and on applying an “antislavery usable past” that recognises the importance of slavery survivor voices to antislavery. Trodd analysed the self\-representation of Frederick Douglass, 19<sup>th</sup>\-century America’s most well\-known survivor of slavery, including Douglass’ extensive use of his life\-story and image to advocate for change \( **1**\). She then researched the legacies of Douglass’ self\-representation \( **2**\) for 20<sup>th</sup>\- and 21<sup>st</sup>\-century social justice movements, and outlined the strategies available for policymakers across Europe as they tackle the problem of modern slavery, including the use of slavery survivors’ testimony to better understand slavery’s root causes \( **3**\). 

 Trodd’s research \( **3**\) included material on the definition of modern slavery, for which she drew on the early stages of her research into contemporary survivor narratives to make the case for a definition based on the core characteristics of enslaved peoples’ experiences. As part of this research, Trodd created *Voices: Narratives by Survivors of Modern Slavery* \( [www.antislavery.ac.uk/narratives](http://www.antislavery.ac.uk/narratives)\), the world's largest archive of modern slavery survivor narratives. Between 2014 \- 2019, she applied the lessons of 19<sup>th</sup>\-century survivors’ self\-representation \( **1**, **2**\) to work with NGO partners and a grant\-funded team \( **6**\) of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to gather over 1000 narratives—over a million words—by survivors of modern slavery for *Voices*. She soft\-launched the database with 50 narratives in 2016, grew it to 1000 narratives over a three\-year period, then launched it publicly in early 2019. It had over 1200 narratives by 2020 and continues to grow. The database provides access to survivors’ ideas and voices, on a large scale, for the first time. Since its launch it has offered policymakers and NGOs the opportunity to systematically design new strategies based on modern slavery survivors’ experiences and ideas. It provides insights from survivors’ own voices into modern slavery hotspots, trafficking routes, and the nature of the challenges that survivors face in liberation. 

 There remains no legal definition of “modern slavery” and so, supported by ESRC funding \( **7**\), Trodd analysed the survivor narratives in order to provide a definition of modern slavery that could be used in practice by policymakers and frontline workers \( **4**\). Her analysis of the narratives revealed survivors’ definitions of modern slavery, and showed what these definitions reveal about the limitations of government and NGO approaches to tackling modern slavery. It examined key debates on the legal definition of modern slavery from the perspective of survivors, and argued that survivor narratives point to five new criteria that help to define modern slavery, all based on elements of human experience lost or denied to those who are enslaved. It showed that what ties these definitional layers together is their shared starting\-point: slavery’s impact on the individual rather than the slaveholder’s intent. Her research concluded that a survivor\-informed definition expands our understanding of slavery’s nature and can shape antislavery policies and practice. 

 Trodd also researched the role of survivors in antislavery movement\-building across two centuries, comparing 19<sup>th</sup>\- and 21<sup>st</sup>\-century survivor organising techniques, and used the modern slavery survivor narratives database to offer recommendations for how to better recognise contemporary survivor voices as part of a long tradition that includes historical survivor\-leaders like Douglass and Harriet Tubman \( **5**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 2016/17 Trodd was instrumental in developing the University of Nottingham’s Rights Lab Beacon of Research Excellence, one of 6 transdisciplinary Beacons each addressing a global challenge, directed at the UN SDGs. Trodd has been the Director of the Rights Lab since its inception and has led the development of the research and impact agenda for the Rights Lab and its research teams \(members of whom are survivors of modern slavery\). The Rights Lab delivers research to help end modern slavery \(SDG 8.7\), which traps an estimated 40,000,000 people globally. It is the world’s largest and leading group of modern slavery researchers. Trodd’s leadership has been instrumental in establishing mechanisms to ensure recognition of the policy value of survivor narratives, shape policymaking and give survivors agency in influencing NGO practice. She used her research into survivor self\-representation to position modern slavery survivors’ voices at the centre of today’s antislavery efforts. 

 **Establishing the Policy Value of Survivor Narratives with Key Stakeholders** 

 Trodd supervised research fellows from the Rights Lab to produce two key policy documents: 

 1\) *Voices: Ideas for Using Survivor Testimony in Antislavery Work* \(2019, Murray *et. al*\), uses Trodd’s research into survivor narratives \( **3**, **4**\) and the *Voices* database \( **4, 6**\) to explain the many potential uses of survivor testimony for policymakers and NGOs, including for understanding patterns of exploitation; recognising drivers for modern slavery across sectors and regions; designing interventions that focus on prevention and survivor\-informed programme evaluations; refocusing aftercare around survivor needs; and understanding the impact of disruptions \(for example, environmental disasters\) on modern slavery risk. The *Voices* report is included in the resource section of the **UK Independent Anti\-Slavery Commissioner \(IASC\)** website. 

 2\) *Survivor Involvement in Anti\-Slavery Policy Making: Guidance for Policy Makers* \(2020, Brotherton *et. al*\) uses the lessons of the narratives database \( **4, 6**\) about the value of survivors’ insights, and Trodd’s research about models of survivor leadership \( **5**\), to provide guidance for policymakers on how best to involve survivors in the work of designing policy and front\-line services. The **Independent Commission for Aid Impact \(ICAI\)** cited a paragraph from the *Survivor Involvement* report in a 2020 evaluation of the UK Government’s response to modern slavery that called for more survivor involvement in antislavery work \[ **E**\], while the **Home Office** called the report “ *really useful*” and said it would “ *take note*” of its guidance “ *going forward*” \[ **C**\]. 

 **Influencing Policymaking** 

 At a national level Trodd responded to a request in 2018 to brief the **Cabinet Office** and the Chairman of the **Joint Intelligence Committee** on her findings about the drivers of modern slavery that emerged from the *Voices* database. The briefing session discussed the narratives, including their value for revealing human trafficking routes \[ **B**\]. As a result of the briefing, the Joint Intelligence Organisation requested information from Trodd on whether the narratives could show “ *the movements of trafficked individuals … how people become enslaved in the first place*” \[ **B**\]. 

 In 2019, Trodd used her research findings to help shape the **Home Office’s** Modern Slavery Act \(MSA\) Section 49 Statutory Guidance on identifying and assisting victims. Working with the Rights Lab Impact and Policy Engagement lead \(Brotherton\), Trodd shared with the Home Office \(and 20 other key policy stakeholders who work on the question of slavery survivor recovery and support\) her article \( **4**\) about survivor definitions of modern slavery, and a two\-page policy briefing on the article’s findings. The policy briefing included four key recommendations for policymakers, including to ensure that survivor voices are central to the development of survivor support services. The Home Office confirmed that it found the research “ *on definitions extremely helpful*” and invited feedback on its draft Statutory Guidance from Trodd and the Rights Lab team \[ **C**\]. Trodd used her research findings \( **4**\) to inform her response, and the Home Office then used this feedback to edit the final Guidance \(published in March 2020\), which explains: “S *urvivors’ voices must always be heard, and their rights respected*” \[ **C**\]. The Home Office called Trodd’s feedback on the Statutory Guidance “ *useful*” and “ *really helpful*,” and confirmed that it tried to “ *reflect*” it in the guidance \[ **C**\]. 

 In 2019, Trodd and Brotherton shared Trodd’s research \( **4**\) and its accompanying two\-page policy briefing with the **Care Quality Commission** **\(CQC\)**, which regulates all health and adult social care in England. The CQC was developing an inspection framework to assess the quality of support services and safehouses for survivors of modern slavery. One of the policy briefing’s recommendations, based on Trodd’s research \( **4**\), was to “ *ensure that inspection frameworks of survivor support services incorporate survivor voices and include an assessment of the extent to which the five elements lost or denied to those in slavery have been restored*” through recovery support. The CQC confirmed that it “ *found the paper very useful and it was included in the guidance pack that has been given to our inspectors*” \[ **D**\], adding that the CQC also looked closely, “ *as part of our inspection process and assessment framework, at how survivors’ views are being sought by providers and how providers are working to understand the psychological impact on survivors of their circumstances*” in order to “ *ensure that the wellbeing of survivors is central to the safehouse provision*” \[ **D**\]. The CQC’s safehouse inspection framework includes recommendations for how inspectors should consult directly with survivors in 16 different parts of the overall guidance \[ **D**\]. The inspection regime went live in October 2020 \[ **D**\] and was incorporated into the Government’s new Modern Slavery Victim Care Contract, worth GBP281,000,000 over five years \(2020\-25\) \[ **D**\]. The Government believes this regime will “ *ensure the consistency and quality of support … and give victims the help and support they need to begin to rebuild their lives*” \[ **D**\]. 

 In 2020, Trodd’s research shaped another set of UK Government strategies. The **Independent Commission for Aid Impact \(ICAI\)** reviewed the UK's approach to tackling modern slavery through the aid programme and explained in a paper that a “ *unique and innovative feature*” of its review was its work to “ *mine a major survivor testimony database for relevant narratives … Voices … the world’s largest database of survivor testimonies*” \[ **E**\]. ICAI used Trodd’s database to “ *gain a broader understanding of the nature of the modern slavery challenges in our case study countries and beyond*” and “ *to provide context on the impact of modern slavery on victims and survivors*” \[ **E**\]. The final ICAI report gave as one of its five recommendations that UK Government departments “ *do more to draw on survivor voices, in ethical ways, with a particular focus on inputs to policy and programme design, and to deepening understanding of lifetime experiences*” \[ **E**\]. In its response to the ICAI report in November 2020, the Government accepted this key recommendation, acknowledged “ *the need to improve the integration of survivor voices into the design, implementation and review of the HMG modern slavery portfolio*” and committed to reviewing “ *lessons from the way in which we engage with survivors*” \[ **E**\]. 

 At the international level, in March 2019 Trodd led a Rights Lab team in the development of a written submission to the **UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery** delivered in September 2019 to the **UN Human Rights Council**. Adapting and citing the findings of Trodd’s research \( **4**, **5**\), the Rights Lab’s submission to the Rapporteur explained the importance of empowering survivors to develop strategic interventions that focus on addressing lived experiences, employing survivors’ ideas in antislavery programme design to achieve a survivor\-informed perspective on sustainable development, and developing survivor\-informed policy at the local, national and international levels. The Rapporteur’s final report used the evidence submission and cited Trodd’s 2018 article \( **4**\) and pointed to a “ *growing recognition that giving victims and survivors agency and voice through their active participation in programme and policy design and delivery strengthens those initiatives*”; argued that “ *survivors are uniquely placed to…identify what might prevent slavery*”. The Rapporteur praised a “ *growing effort…to empower survivors as…leaders of the anti\-slavery movement*” and recommended that future antislavery efforts “ *be more systematically survivor\-informed*” and “ *ensure that the full range of global, regional and national efforts benefit from the insights that survivors can bring to bear on programming and policy design and implementation*”. The Rapporteur quoted the Rights Lab’s evidence submission: “‘ *survivor\-informed policy and survivor\-led initiatives should be the norm and not the exception*’” \[ **A**\]. The Special Rapporteur’s concluding recommendations were that States ensure “ *antislavery efforts are survivor\-informed*,” including “ *policymaking, programme design and programme implementation*”; businesses work “ *closely with survivors…to ensure that future antislavery efforts learn from their experience*”; and international organisations promote “ *active victim/survivor participation in policymaking*” \[ **A**\]. Citing Trodd’s article \( **4**\) and evidence submission as its main sources of evidence for these recommendations \[ **A**\], the report delivered the strongest call to date, by any Special Rapporteur, for survivor\-informed antislavery efforts. 

 **Changing NGO Practice** 

 Working as both an individual scholar and as the director of the Rights Lab, Trodd has also supported a survivor leader, Minh Dang, to establish and grow **Survivor Alliance** \(SA\), the world’s first survivor\-led NGO that empowers survivors to be antislavery leaders. SA launched in April 2018 with Dang as its Executive Director. It was incubated in the Rights Lab for its first year, then by mid\-2019 became an independent not\-for\-profit that works in partnership with the Rights Lab. 

 SA organises and coordinates survivor leadership in the UK and globally \[ **F**\]. It is the first survivor\-led NGO to focus on developing survivors as leaders in the contemporary global antislavery movement, and “ *moves survivors from being occasional spokespeople to strategic thinkers and movement leaders*,” as Trodd explained in a media interview on the day of SA’s launch \[ **F**\]. SA had 130 survivor members globally by the end of its first year, 211 members by the end of its second year, and 290 by December 2020 \[ **F**\]. Its annual reports for 2018 and 2019 show a critical mass of interconnected survivor leaders who have improved access to employment and training in the antislavery field \[ **F**\]. Dang explained SA’s impact thus: “ *We have seen changes to the cultures and practices of the antislavery movement to incorporate survivor expertise through dozens of SA consultations and training sessions, including several on which Zoe and the Rights Lab have partnered to deliver*” \[ **G**\]. By early 2020, SA had already created 90 consulting opportunities for survivors and further enabled survivors by raising over USD9,300 \(to Oct 2020\) in income and scholarships for their use \[ **F**\]. 

 SA members described the impact of SA’s work for them: “ *Survivor Alliance has given survivors in the UK a platform to raise our voice and a space where we can unite and empower ourselves*”; "" *I was never taken seriously until Survivor Alliance stepped in*”; “ *Survivor Alliance…has made me feel like helping other people who are exploited more, it has made me understand other survivors and victims better*”; “ *Survivor Alliance have given me the platform to empower myself, and speak up loud enough for the authorities and media to hear me*”; "" *Survivor Alliance has opened my eyes to see that my life experience is my expertise… created a platform for me to share my expertise... and educated me in the process*""; “ *Survivor Alliance has given me tremendous support to build my confidence and amplify my voice in the field*”; “ *Survivor Alliance allowed me to connect with other survivors, to...give me the necessary support to take action in the anti\-human trafficking movement. It feels like another part of my healing journey*” \[ **F**\]. 

 Dang explained the importance of the collaboration with Trodd and the Rights Lab to SA’s success. The Rights Lab is SA’s “ *key partner*,” has been a “ *fantastic supporter of who we are and what we do*,” and was “ *important to different stages of Survivor Alliance’s launch, growth and development*” \[ **G**\]; while Trodd “ *has been an important partner*” to SA, supported its “ *launch in 2018 and its growth over the next 2.5 years, including by leading on the development of a Survivor\-Ally Manifesto with 14 Principles of Ally Behaviour and nine concrete commitments to action*” \[ **G**\]. Dang noted that this manifesto “ *formed part of a national training for survivor allies \(including from the Home Office and major NGOs\) in October 2019 for the UK's National Anti\-Slavery Day*” \[ **G**\] which generated pledges by 18 of the participating organisations \(including the **West Midlands Anti\-Slavery Network, Sainsbury's, the Home Office, Anti\-Slavery International and Hope for Justice**\). These set out concrete ways they would integrate survivor leadership into their work \[ **H**\]. Dang expanded on Trodd’s role: “ *I have greatly valued her research\-informed co\-development of Ally guidance, policy briefings and training materials, as well as her collaboration to turn her research findings \(about the importance of survivor voice and leadership\) into action in the form of her intellectual partnership and practical support for Survivor Alliance*” \[ **G**\]. Trodd’s work with SA, including on the manifesto \[ **H**\], was informed by her research into survivor leadership \( **5**\), which in turn drew from her analyses of survivor self\-representation \( **1**, **2**\) and narratives \( **3**, **4**\)—and Dang observed that Trodd’s research “ *helped to underpin Survivor Alliance’s mission with evidence*” \[ **G**\]. 

 The onward impact of Trodd’s work with SA extended through SA’s work with multiple leading NGOs. For example, SA changed the work of the leading international human rights NGO **Walk Free** in its high\-profile annual report about all government responses to modern slavery globally. In October 2018, Walk Free asked SA to review its conceptualisation of a strong government response to modern slavery \[ **I**\]. In a workshop setting hosted at the Rights Lab, a group of 10 UK\-based SA members provided detailed insight into Walk Free’s conceptual framework across 104 indicators and developed concrete policy recommendations for improving government response. In April 2019, SA delivered a similar three\-day workshop with Walk Free in India with 15 survivors of modern slavery that built “ *on the model developed in Nottingham*” and was “ *the first time survivors in India had gathered to share lived experiences and perspectives on government progress in responding to slavery*” \[ **I**\]. The workshop in India generated a further six recommendations for the government assessment \[ **I**\]. 

 As Walk Free explained, these two workshops with SA “ *provided us with valuable insight into what was actually important for those who have experienced various forms of slavery*,” and the workshop findings “ *were incorporated into our conceptual framework*,” therefore shaping how Walk Free completed its data\-gathering for the government response assessment \[ **I**\]. Walk Free also said of SA’s impact on its own practise that the SA workshops provided “ *invaluable feedback for … our advocacy work* … \[and\] *helped us to strengthen our understanding of the implications of government policy to combat modern slavery*,”\[ **F**\]. Walk Free also explained that the workshops enabled participating survivors themselves “ *to gather information that they could take back to their communities*” and to “ *use the report to hold their government to account … \[and\] push for legislative change*” \[ **I**\]. Walk Free’s final report was launched at the UN headquarters in July 2019 with an invitation to governments to respond by changing their policies and strategies. The **President of the UN General Assembly** said at its launch that the report showed “ *we need to take dramatic action ... we must have the data and evidence we need to design appropriate responses, and to measure our progress. Which is why this report is so important*” \[ **I**\]. 

 In addition to this impact on Walk Free, SA changed the policies and practices of other major NGOs. In interviews about SA, leading antislavery NGOs explained the benefit of SA’s input to multiple NGO projects and programmes that now were “ *shaped and guided by those with lived experience*” \[ **J**\]. For example, access to survivor expertise via SA shifted NGOs’ work in new directions, helped them identify new areas of focus and stop other programmes, and shaped the design and delivery of multiple major antislavery programmes \[ **J**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Parkes’ and Unterhalter’s programme of research, undertaken at UCL Institute of Education, has helped to create and sustain more gender\-equitable, safe schools, with far\-reaching effects on the safety and well\-being of girls and boys in schools across eight countries in Africa where the research has been focused. The work has influenced global and national agencies, governments and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\), strengthening the ways in which gender equality in education is understood and evaluated, through the generation of robust data, and the use of rigorous research evidence to enhance global, national and local policy and practice. The research has influenced the release of long term funding of GBP800,000,000 for implementation projects. Young people in any more countries in the continent and beyond have benefited as programmes are rolled out through agencies.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research addresses challenges of gender inequalities and violence in education through collaborations with global organisations, governments, NGOs and researchers in Africa. While there has been considerable attention in research and policy to getting girls into school, this focus has neglected the gender relations and intersecting inequalities in school and out of school that differentially affect particular groups of girls’ vulnerability to marginalisation, discrimination and violence. Policies on girls’ education developed at national or international levels have often been transmitted in linear top\-down ways, with little engagement with, or insights into, perspectives and practices in schools and communities. The research has addressed these weaknesses through, firstly, analysing and conceptualising the complexity of gender and other inequalities in education, and secondly, through collaborating extensively with multiple partners to co\-produce evidence to inform policy and practice. The research findings have been shared in over 70 publications since 2005 \(including over 40 journal articles, 20 research reports and 10 books\). The research programme featured three key projects highlighted below. 

 **Accountability for gender equality in education \(AGEE\)** \(GBP442,704\): A 4\-year study \(2018–21\), led by Unterhalter, jointly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) and the UK Department for International Development \(DFID, now Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office \(FCDO\)\) which aimed to develop an indicator framework in education supporting the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\) and government initiatives on gender equality in education **\(R1\)**. Unterhalter and her team developed a gender equality in education monitoring ‘dashboard’ \( **R1**, figure 6\) and convened a community of practice on indicators for gender equality in education, involving the United Nations Girls Education Initiative \(UNGEI\) and UNESCO. The data collection, which included interviews and workshops with National Statistical Offices, governments and women’s rights activists in Malawi and South Africa, examined the effectiveness and feasibility of the dashboard. 

 This research builds on findings from Unterhalter’s ESRC funded study: *Gender, Education and Global Policy Reduction Initiatives* \(2007–11\) and on the DFID funded *Rigorous Review of Evidence on Girls’ Education and Gender Equality* **\(R2\)** which showed a disconnection between the aspirations of global policies and the interpretation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects. Global Policy Reduction Initiatives’ research methods involved case studies in Kenya and South Africa, with interviews, observations, and document analysis in the national Department/Ministry of Education, a provincial department, a school, a local and a global NGO. 

 <ins>Key findings/insights</ins>: Gender inequality outside schools and education systems has consequences for institutional arrangements within education systems **\(R2, R3\)**. There is a need to identify and join up the work of all stakeholders involved and develop monitoring and evaluation to review these relationships **\(R3\)**. 

 **End Gender Violence in Schools** GBP708,960: An action research project in Zambia, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire and Togo between 2014–17, led by Parkes, with UNICEF and funded by the Global Partnership for Education. This research used evidence as set out below to strengthen policy and practice on school\-related gender\-based violence \(SRGBV\). Following a global literature review, scoping data were collected through 20 to 30 in\-depth stakeholder interviews in each country; workshops and analyses of research, policy and programme texts to evaluate prevalence and patterns of SRGBV; analysis of laws, policies and plans, structures and partnerships, responses in and around schools, prevention through teaching and learning, and systems for data collection. Findings from these studies informed the development and implementation of action plans by country teams led by Education Ministries. Research outputs included a rigorous review of global evidence **\(R4\)**; 4 country scoping studies of policy, practice and evidence on SRGBV, cross\-country analysis, and 2 qualitative studies **\(R5\)**. 

 <ins>Key findings/insights:</ins> The research identified how interventions to address SRGBV were often piecemeal, with policy enactment hampered by political, conceptual and resource challenges at all levels of the education sector **\(R4\)**. This was exemplified in the study in Ethiopia, with patchy implementation of policy across the country, and low levels of reporting or follow up in schools **\(R5\)**. Based on the evidence collected, Parkes and her team developed a multi\-dimensional SRGBV framework that addresses the causes and consequences of violence in norms and inequalities, through ‘whole school’ approaches, with participatory engagement of students and staff, and stress on interconnectedness with families, communities, services and local\-mid\-national policy environments \( **R4**, figure 1\). 

 **Good Schools Study** \(2012–2015\) and the **Contexts of Violence in Adolescence Cohort Study \(COVAC\)** \(2018–2022\): Raising Voices, a Ugandan NGO, developed the Good School Toolkit. The objective of the Good Schools Study research was to evaluate whether the Toolkit  reduced physical violence from school staff to students, with methods including a randomised control trial in 42 schools and qualitative interviews and focus groups **\(R6\)**. The COVAC study is a long\-term follow up of participants in the Good Schools Study. It is a mixed methods cohort project, with 3 waves of epidemiological survey data collection, and four waves of qualitative longitudinal data collection, providing detailed insights into how adolescents’ violence\-related experiences, perspectives and practices relate to their social contexts and how these change over time. The research, funded by the Medical Research Council, is a collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Raising Voices, with Parkes leading the qualitative longitudinal study. 

 <ins>Key findings/insights</ins>: The violence prevention intervention \- the Good Schools Toolkit \- reduced violence in schools by 42 per cent over 18 months and improved children’s sense of well\-being and connection to schools. The studies identified characteristics of whole school interventions that can generate more equitable, safe schools, including engaging school staff and students in reflection and action to strengthen alternative non\-violent approaches to discipline. They also addressed questions about sustainability, as young people move to secondary schools or out of schools **\(R6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Parkes and Unterhalter has re\-focused global policy \(FCDO, UNICEF, UNGEI\) to address gender inequality and violence in education. The research has contributed to a\) the ways governments are making and implementing policies in Africa; b\) decisions to greatly increase funding for this work; c\) the development of evidence\-informed programmes, and d\) strengthening approaches to monitoring progress on gender and violence prevention in the education sector. As a consequence, the work has had far\-reaching effects on the safety and well\-being of young people in schools in and beyond Africa, confirmed by two senior officials who worked closely with the team on the development and application of the research findings: 

 ‘*Professor Unterhalter and Parkes engagement has helped put girls’ education at the top of DFID’s agenda and their research has been key to influencing DFID’s policy, spending and programming priorities towards girls’ education. Their work has been central to DFID achieving its objective of getting all children learning*’ \( **S1** Head of Education Research, FCDO \(formerly DfID\). 

 ‘*Regarding measuring gender equality in education, IOE has had a significant impact on the manner in which the global community defines, frames admonitors gender equality in education*’ \( **S2** Head of United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative, UNGEI\). 

 The research has built partnerships with policy makers and practitioners to strengthen the evidence. For example, in the End Gender Violence in Schools project **\(R5\)**, Parkes and her team engaged the Ministry of Education in Ethiopia and UNICEF in the research through workshops to design the study and reflect on the findings. This led to revision of their Code of Conduct to Prevent SRGBV and to developing an action plan to prioritise a series of policy changes to ensure better outcomes, informed by the recommendations **\(S3\)**. It included action to improve coordination between government bodies responsible for education, justice, health and social protection, so that cases are handled with more sensitivity and accountability, and more children are encouraged to report their experiences. It also involved improved training for teachers to help them better understand and address inequitable norms and stigma linked to SRGBV. These improvements are being rolled out across the country, affecting 20,800,000 children in primary and 2,600,000 in secondary school, with intensive work taking place in two states \(Amhara and Addis Ababa\), improving safety and wellbeing for 5,800,000 children \(Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Ministry of Education, 2017\). 

 In Uganda, the collaboration throughout all stages of the COVAC research, including a recent workshop reflecting on emerging findings with stakeholders from government and NGOs, was described by the head of a lead NGO as: ‘ *an example of how researchers can enhance the practical work of NGOs by sharing research skills, real time analysis of data and how it can inform refinement of interventions*’ **\(S4\)**. The Good Schools study findings **\(R6\)** increased understanding of how to work with whole school communities to reduce corporal punishment and enabled the NGO to take a leading role in supporting the scaling up of this school\-based violence prevention intervention, in collaboration with government and civil society organisations. In their testimonial, the NGO confirms that this has led to safer environments in more than 1000 schools, benefitting an estimated 750,000 children in Uganda **\(S4\)**. 

 The research findings have been taken up and shared through a range of tools that are influencing the work of organisations and governments on gender and violence around the world. Guidance stemming from the research on working with school communities to address SRGBV **\(R3\)** features in learning resources targeting policy makers and practitioners globally \- UNGEI’s Thematic Briefs on Ending SRGBV **\(S2, S5\)**, and Apolitical’s Field Guide to Safer Schools **\(S6\)**. The findings have advanced work with UNGEI and UNICEF on minimal standards for and monitoring of a whole school approach to prevent and respond to SRGBV **\(S7** p.6 **\)**. The Minimum Standards guide sets out a global framework to help governments and NGOs across the world ensure and monitor gender equity and safety in schools. 

 The research team worked closely with DFID, supporting the production of their ‘REDNote’, which sets out evidence\-based guidance on how to work on school violence. This engagement ensured that DFID put ‘whole school approaches’ at the centre of their work **\(S1, R4\)**. DFID education advisors in over 17 countries in Africa and Asia have subsequently reviewed policies and programmes and oriented towards using whole school approaches, including creating dialogue with government and NGO partners about how to do this: ‘ *Drawing on work of both Jenny Parkes and Elaine Unterhalter our 2018 Education Policy has committed to strengthening our engagement at every level in the system to ensure gender issues are addressed*’ **\(S1\)**. The research has also influenced decisions to make a very significant funding commitment to this area: ‘ *This includes the development of a new programme providing significant £300m of new funding for policy change and programming in this area*’ **\(S1\)**. 

 The research is helping to improve the ways gender equality and SRGBV are addressed, monitored and evaluated in education. Unterhalter’s scholarship on conceptualising gender equality in education and her focus on marginalisation **\(R2, R3\)** has ‘ *substantially influenced*’ **\(S8\)** DFID’s Girls’ Education Challenge \(GEC\) programmes, such that they are targeted on addressing multiple forms of marginalisation ‘ *We drew on recommendations to ensure analyses of exclusion look at intersecting inequalities associated with contexts, power dynamics and risks of sexual violence*’ **\(S8\)**. This has influenced the delivery of programmes totalling GBP500m **\(S1\)**, with testimonials evidencing how her monitoring framework has been mainstreamed across programmes and is ‘ *estimated to have reached 1,317,695 direct beneficiaries*’ across 41 projects in 17 countries **\(S8\)**. UNESCO’s 2018 Gender Review **\(S9\)** reframed its approach to accountability using Unterhalter’s conceptualisations of gender \(p.37\). Its approach cites her framework to identify the need to incorporate additional dimensions, including scrutiny of power relations and normative aspirations on justice and equality beyond education \(p.10\). 

 The AGEE research has been instrumental in building a community of practice among key organisations engaged with measuring aspects of inequalities and equalities associated with education, including the UN Development Programme \(UNDP\), Oxfam, LSE Equality project and UNESCO, and with government and NGO partners in South Africa and Malawi. The ‘dashboard’ of indicators on gender and education **\(R1\)** was introduced into the G7 endorsed Gender at the Centre Initiative ‘ *to guide the integration of gender into education analysis across the 8 partner countries in Africa*’ **\(S2\)**. The dashboard has been ‘ *fully integrated into the Global Education Monitoring Report Gender Review, which is the global authority on education around the world*’ **\(S2, S9\)**, and is being used by UNESCO to monitor progress towards the education targets in the SDGs; and to shape the global database used in its annual monitoring: ‘ *this innovative approach \[that\] not only helps improve our monitoring of progress towards gender equality in and through education, but also to monitor changes in existing laws and policies*’ **\(S10\)**. The studies on the policies, institutions and politics of gender and education **\(R1, R3, R5\)** have helped to refine UNGEI’s capacity development and advocacy work on Gender Responsive Education Sector Planning, through a series of workshops with key government officials from over 27 countries in Africa and Asia, working to formulate education sector plans that eliminate discrimination **\(S2\)**. 

 In sum, Parkes’ and Unterhalter’s research has contributed to improving gender equality and violence prevention in schools. Their findings have influenced major funding bodies to inject funding of approx. GBP800,000,000 to support innovative research\-informed programmes. Working with well\-established and collaborative partnerships at global, national and local levels, the work has helped to improve policies, practices and research that support school communities and education systems in Africa and beyond, to create safer and more equitable learning environments for young people and their teachers.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Assessing the population’s diet is essential for monitoring public health and evaluating the impact of campaigns, but traditional methods are time\-consuming, impractical and expensive. Newcastle University therefore developed Intake24, an accurate and user\-friendly online food diary. Users input their food intake over the past 24 hours and the system automatically codes their responses, providing substantial time and cost savings. A major innovation, Intake24 was used by Public Health England to assess the Government’s “Sugar Smart” campaign, saving around £250,000. It was recently adopted into the National Diet and Nutrition Survey to assess population dietary intake across the UK, and has been used by Coeliac UK to assess the intakes of 1,000 people following a gluten\-free diet. Intake24 was also used to assess the diets of 16,000 participants in Denmark and Portugal, saving £50,000. A successful pilot of Intake24 in the 2018/19 Scottish Health Survey led Food Standards Scotland to adopt the system for subsequent surveys.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Unmet need</ins> 

 Government agencies such as Public Health England \(PHE\) monitor the population’s dietary intake for risk assessment, appropriate targeting of nutrition\-related policies and to monitor the outcome of campaigns. To calculate the constituent nutrients of a diet, accurate portion size measurement is crucial. Although the most accurate measure is a weighed food diary, their completion requires substantial subject training and motivation. This considerable burden reduces participation and completion rates, resulting in lower quality data. In addition, coding and analysis of the diaries requires considerable time, expertise and cost. Newcastle therefore developed Intake24, an accurate and user\-friendly system where users input the food and drink that they remember eating over the past 24 hours \(a “recall”\), and the system automatically records the nutritional composition and gram weight of each item. 

 <ins>The development of Intake24</ins> 

 The research began by comparing three tools that improve the accuracy of portion size estimation: food photographs, food models and a novel interactive portion size assessment system developed by Newcastle \(R1\). This system allows the user to scroll through photographs of real foods depicting various portion sizes, select the image that most closely represents what they ate and indicate any food left over. Estimates using the system were closer to the actual weight and nutrient content of food eaten than the photographs or models, and showed the least variability. 

 The next study \(R2\) improved the original system and expanded the range of food types to 104 and images to over 1,300, including the top 100 from the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey. The updated system showed good accuracy and fair precision compared to 4\-day weighed intakes. 

 Having established sufficient accuracy, the next step was to develop a computerised system, now known as Intake24. This iteration of the system \(R3\) included adaptations to enable self\-completion, such as a search function and instructions to add meals, snacks and drinks consumed the previous day. 

 Intake24 was further developed with four cycles of iterative feedback from users \(R4 and R5\). The search function was refined to recognise misspelt words, brand names, phonetic spelling and phonemes, and added cues such as requesting further detail when the user provided insufficient information. Since the system was intended to monitor population diet, large\-scale availability was a key feature and it was therefore developed to allow online access. The system was compared to interviewer\-led 24\-hour recalls, considered by many as the gold standard of dietary assessment, and was found to provide estimates of energy intake that were just 1% lower on average than the interviewer\-led recall. In addition, 85% of all foods and drinks recorded were an exact match. Using an industry\-standard System Usability Scale to measure user friendliness, the system was rated as 83/100 where over 80 is considered excellent**Footnote:**

 Bangor et al. 2009 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2835587.2835589 
. The ease of completing Intake24 and minimal training required improves participants’ motivation and therefore completion rates. 

 Finally, the system was field tested with participants aged 11 to 65\+ years who had previously taken part in the Scottish Health Survey \(R6\). Of the 132 participants who completed four or more recalls, over 80% agreed that Intake24 was easy to follow and understand, and completion took an average of 14 minutes. There were only a small number of requests for help, of which the vast majority were resolved in less than 10 minutes. 

 This iterative development with user feedback allowed the development of a powerful, intuitive and accurate system suitable for use in national surveys of population diet. Its adoption into such surveys is described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Advantages of Intake24</ins> 

 The main advantage offered by Intake24 \(available at  [intake24.co.uk](http://intake24.co.uk/)\) is removing the need for a trained nutritionist to visit the participant’s home to conduct an interview, which typically lasts an hour, and then code this information, which can take a further hour. Using this online system also avoids the need for planning the logistics of these visits, therefore offering substantial savings in terms of cost and time. For the participant, Intake24 offers convenience, as the recalls can be completed at a time and place suitable for them, and do not have to be completed in one go. The reduced burden may increase participants’ motivation to complete the recall and also discourage them from changing their dietary intake to facilitate recording. Another related advantage of Intake24 is that it removes social desirability bias, where a participant answers in a manner that would be viewed favourably by others, since there is no interviewer present. The system can also provide immediate dietary feedback to the user, which has been reported to be very useful. Finally, the automatic coding of the data means that accuracy does not vary with the experience and diligence of the researcher. Unlike another UK\-based tool \(myfood24\), Intake24 has adopted all aspects of the US Department of Agriculture’s Automated Multiple Pass Method and is free of charge. 

 <ins>Use of Intake24 to assess UK population dietary intake</ins> 

 To date, Intake24 has been used in four major programmes that assessed the UK population’s diet, providing crucial data to support risk assessment, policy development \(including monitoring and evaluation\) and inform further public health campaigns. 

 The first was the “Sugar Smart” campaign, which ran in early 2016 as part of Change4Life, the Government’s brand to tackle childhood obesity in England. Public Health England \(PHE\) chose Intake24 to assess the campaign as it provided a more rapid and less invasive approach than traditional methods involving face\-to\-face interviews or the collection of blood and urine samples. Intake24 was used to assess around 3,300 diets and allowed PHE to save substantial costs of approximately £250,000 \(EV1\). 

 The second campaign was the National Diet and Nutrition Survey \(NDNS\), a rolling programme established in 2008 to assess UK public diet, nutrient intake and nutritional status. In 2018, NatCen Social Research and the MRC Epidemiology Unit at Cambridge University were awarded the contract to deliver the third wave of the NDNS \(2018–2023\), a pivotal objective of which was to move the survey from a paper food diary to a digital assessment tool. After a detailed review of the methods available, Intake24 stood out as a strong candidate for the NDNS due to published evidence of its usability, validity and performance, its completeness of data collection, ease of use and acceptability to participants, its open\-source nature and the potential for adaptation and customisation \(EV1, EV2\). Further development of Intake24 since 2018 has been undertaken in conjunction with Cambridge University, and in October 2019 it was launched in the NDNS to collect data from 1,200 people over the subsequent year. Fieldwork was suspended in March 2020 with the outbreak of COVID\-19, but early evaluation results were positive \(EV2\). 

 Thirdly, the charity Coeliac UK used Intake24 in the specific Coeliac Diet and Nutrition Survey \(CDNS, EV3\) to assess the diets of people with coeliac disease, following a strictly gluten\-free diet, who were not covered by the NDNS. Using Intake24, a pilot of the CDNS began in 2017 and its success led to full roll\-out in March 2018, with data collection completed in July 2019. During the project, Intake24 was used to collect 1,331 recalls once a day for four days – a total of 5,324 individual recalls. Intake24 allowed Coeliac UK to assess food intake with a larger number of participants more rapidly and at a lower cost than traditional methods. In addition, feedback collected following the most recent phase of the CDNS identified that 88% of respondents found using Intake24 easy or very easy \(EV3\). 

 Finally, Intake24 was piloted by Food Standards Scotland \(FSS\) in 2018/19, assessing a total of 2,112 recalls \(EV4\). Of the 800 respondents that provided feedback in the pilot, 87% felt they were able to complete Intake24 in a reasonable time and 33% said that they would make changes to their diet as a result of completing the recall. The approach taken to integrate Intake24 into the Survey was broadly successful. \(EV5\). The success of this pilot led FSS to take the decision in November 2020 to use Intake24 for the Survey, starting in 2021, with around 2,500 participants per year. 

 <ins>Use in a European study of weight loss maintenance</ins> 

 Intake24 was also used in the NoHow programme to investigate the maintenance of weight loss. NoHow, which ran from March 2017 to October 2019, was an international project involving partners in Denmark, Portugal and the UK. Intake24 was used to assess around 16,000 recalls \(over 5,100 were the English version, over 5,500 the Portuguese version and 5,300 the Danish version\). The system allowed the project to assess food intake more rapidly and less invasively than traditional methods, and offered a cost saving of around £50,000 \(EV6\). Feedback from participants included 60% saying they found it easy to use, and around 38% saying it helped with weight control \(EV7\). 

 <ins>In summary</ins>, Newcastle developed a powerful, accurate and intuitive tool to collect population\-level dietary intake that offers cost savings and reduced respondent burden.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Children in state care are among the most vulnerable in society, nationally and globally. Previous experiences of physical and psychological trauma, loss and separation mean that children require therapeutic care if they are to recover from developmental harm, achieve happy, stable adult lives and fulfil their potential. To guide and support caregivers and professionals in meeting these children’s needs successfully, the free to access Secure Base model of therapeutic caregiving was developed by Professor Schofield and Dr Beek in the School of Social Work at UEA from their highly regarded long\-term fostering research \(published 2000\-12\). The Secure Base model has been widely implemented in child welfare agencies across the UK and internationally, including, since 2014, playing an important role in the development of foster care as an alternative to institutional care in Thailand, China and Ukraine. This research\-based practice model has therefore been instrumental in transforming children’s lives in very diverse cultures and contexts. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research was conducted during a period of serious concerns regarding outcomes for vulnerable children in care in the UK and is still relevant for public policy and social work practice today. The number of children in care has risen 30% from 60,000 in 2006, when the Secure Base model was developed, to 78,000 in 2019. Coming into care can be a positive turning point, but without good quality caregiving children with unresolved trauma and emotional difficulties as a result of previous maltreatment are at risk of placement instability, educational underachievement, poor mental health and youth offending. 

 Four research projects on the care of foster children were led by Professor Gillian Schofield \(PI\), with Dr Mary Beek \(Research fellow\), and funded by the Nuffield Foundation. 

-  *Growing up in foster care*: three linked projects \( **R1**, **R2** and **R3**\) followed a cohort of long\-term foster children and their foster families longitudinally. 

-  *Care planning for long\-term foster care*: the fourth project \( **R4**\), was a cross\-sectional study of a cohort of foster children across six local authorities, their families and support services. 

 These studies have led the field by investigating pathways and outcomes for children with a long\-term foster care plan through to adulthood and combining this with practical applications of attachment theory. The research has been of UK and worldwide significance in offering a positive approach to children growing up in long\-term foster care. 

 UEA research used quantitative and qualitative methods \(developmental measures, analysis of case records, interviews with children, birth parents, foster carers and social workers\) to investigate the quality of relationships in foster placements and the caregiving qualities which enabled children to recover from previous trauma and abuse and fulfil their potential. 

 This research identified five caregiving dimensions which promoted good outcomes in terms of stability, security, identity and emotional well\-being for children from backgrounds of maltreatment and trauma. These dimensions are *availability\-helping the child to trust*, *sensitivity\-helping the child to manage feelings*, *acceptance\-building the child’s self\-esteem*, *co\-operation\-helping the child to feel effective* and *family membership\- helping the child to belong*. The first four dimensions were linked to attachment theory, with UEA research making the important new contribution of both identifying the developmental benefit of each dimension *and* demonstrating how attachment concepts originally relating to infancy in intact families were relevant for older children and adolescents being parented by foster carers. The fifth dimension, family membership, was added, as it is an important psychosocial contribution to a secure base, especially for children in foster care who belong to both foster and birth families. Findings provided valuable additional evidence of how foster family relationships provide a sense of belonging as part of the family, as well as offering the benefits of emotional security. 

 The research identified that the five caregiving dimensions interact; for example, trust is linked to raised self\-esteem, and acceptance is necessary for a child to feel a sense of belonging. Together these dimensions form the Secure Base model, represented in the form of a star, with language that is positive, child focussed and accessible to professionals and carers.

 4. Details of the impact 

 The primary beneficiaries of the UEA Secure Base model have been vulnerable children and adolescents in care in the UK and internationally who need sensitive, therapeutic caregiving to recover from harmful early experiences. The model has enabled foster carers, adopters, residential workers, social workers, teachers and other professionals to identify the needs of vulnerable children more accurately and provide a therapeutic caregiving environment that promotes heathy emotional development, supporting children to fulfil their potential in the family, at school and in pro\-social activities in the community. 

 The Secure Base model was actively taken up in the UK and internationally from 2007, but there was a particular growth in its impact on improving the lives of vulnerable children from 2014–20. This was due to the range of new materials available \(e.g. training programmes\), the diverse practice agencies using the model \(e.g. residential care and schools as well as fostering and adoption\), and new countries embedding the model in practice \(e.g. projects in China, Thailand, Ukraine, in addition to the UK and Europe\). Schofield was awarded an OBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours 2020, with the Department for Education recognising her ‘ *outstanding contribution to children, families and social work, including developing the Secure Base model, a framework for understanding and caring for children who have been affected by abuse.*’ **\(S1\)** 

 **Impact on policy and practice in the UK** 

-  **Developing and improving caregiving training and practice** 

 UEA’s Secure Base model provided an authoritative, research based, practical framework that has enabled social workers, foster carers and adopters to apply complex attachment theory. ‘ *The Secure Base Model has established itself as a key framework and tool for social workers and other professionals…The model has undoubtedly been one of the most influential developments for* \[the\] *child placement sector over the last 6 years...’,* \(CoramBAAF Director of Policy, Research and Development\). **\(S2\)** 

 Following the recommendation of the Secure Base model by the Department for Education and Skills in the White Paper, *Care Matters* \(2007:44\), the Fostering Network \(the national organisation for UK foster carers\) commissioned Schofield and Beek to include the Secure Base model in the revised core training *Skills to Foster* \(2009, 2014\) thus benefitting all new foster carers. **\(S3\)** 

 The UEA *Providing a Secure Base* website made updated practice materials available free of charge in the UK and internationally from 2008. The addition of detailed training programmes to the website \(2015\) enabled agencies to deliver training direct to foster carers, adopters and social workers, increasing the reach. The website has been widely accessed e.g. 85,846 hits in 2017/18 \(Google analytics\). 

 Since 2014, a wider range of fostering, adoption and residential care providers in the statutory and voluntary sector in the UK report have benefitted from the Secure Base model, as below. Schofield and Beek have supported these developments, including holding Annual Secure Base Network meetings in London, with agencies attending from all four UK countries. 

-  **Local authority implementation of the Secure Base to improve outcomes** \(S4\)** 

 Local authorities have implemented the Secure Base model, including at policy level across children’s services e.g. the **London Borough of Southwark** Director of Children’s Services made the model one of their three policy ‘pillars’, with Schofield launching it in 2014 to an audience of 250 professionals and caregivers. In 2017 the Director concluded, ‘ *Secure Base implementation has been observed and based on feedback is having a really positive impact on supporting foster carers and enabling them to provide greater empathy, understanding, sense of belonging, support and stability to the children they look after.’* 

 Local authorities have been creative in implementing the model e.g. **West Sussex** Children’s Services delivered the Secure Base training programme to staff and carers, set up Secure Base workshops and established a Secure Base stories library, some written by children. The practice tools had good feedback. A trainer reported: ‘ *The Secure Base Checklist has been very well received... because carers agree that it very quickly “paints a picture of a child/young person”’.* 

 Local authorities have committed resources to support successful implementation e.g. **Manchester Children’s Services**, Southwark and West Sussex, all created designated staff posts for implementing the Secure Base model. A review of Manchester’s fostering services 2017/18 concluded: ‘ *There is an ongoing focus on rolling out Secure Base training to our foster carer pool over the reporting year... Feedback... from foster carers so far has been very positive about the impact the training has had on their ability to meet children’s complex needs.’* 

-  **Independent agencies using Secure Base to improve fostering and residential care** \(S5\)** 

 Successful embedding of the model to improve caregiving was described by **Acorn Care**, an independent fostering agency. ‘ *At the Acorns we use the Secure Base model to focus on each and every interaction that occurs between our caregivers and children/young people that we work with. The Secure Base model also helps us consider how these relationships can enable the child to develop competence in the outside world of school, peer group and community.’* 

 Schofield has worked since 2016 with clinical psychologists, staff and carers at **Family Care**, a fostering and therapeutic residential care provider. Their website highlights the value of the Secure Base model in providing ‘ *a framework for therapeutic caregiving which builds resilience and helps infants, children and young people move towards greater security’*. 

 Ofsted have recognised the role of the Secure Base model in providing high quality care.  **ABC Fostering**, an independent fostering agency, which consulted with Beek and Schofield on implementation of the Secure Base model, was awarded ‘outstanding’ in 2016 and the Ofsted report concluded: ‘ *Children and young people benefit from foster carers who understand the service’s ‘Secure Base’ model and use it in their everyday parenting’.* An ABC foster carer said of the model: ‘ *I see examples of its success every day’.* 

 From 2014 children’s homes providers also started to use the Secure Base model as a framework for therapeutic caregiving \(e.g. **Ryes College**, **New Reflexions\)** in consultation with Schofield. 

-  **New UEA applications in adoption, schools and support for professional staff** \(S6\)** 

 The Secure Base model has provided the foundation for the child\-centred **UEA Moving to Adoption** practice framework \(Beek, Neil and Schofield, 2018\-20, funded by Sir Halley Stewart Foundation\), now adopted by **Regional Adoption Agencies** in England. A fostering social worker commented on its effectiveness in an evaluation: ‘ *Applying* \[the Secure Base model\] *enabled us to see the foster carers as a secure base \- for both the children and adoptive parents’*. 

 Schofield and Beek were funded by the Alex Timpson Trust \(2018\-20\) to develop **Providing a Secure Base in Schools** training programmes to help school staff to support vulnerable children. The **Norfolk Virtual School Head** commissioned UEA to deliver these training programmes in Norfolk \(2019\-20\). They were well received by teaching staff in their evaluations. *‘The Secure Base model is a good model to reflect upon every day to ensure good practice around attachment.’* ‘ *The explanation of different behaviours that children might show due to lack of a secure base and what we can do to help them manage those feelings and deal with those situations was helpful.’* 

 The **Team as Secure Base** framework was developed by Dr Laura Biggart \(UEA\) \(2015\-17\), in partnership with Beek and Schofield, to promote emotional resilience in staff supporting carers and children. In 2017 it was incorporated in the Operating Framework for **Cafcass \(Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service\)** \(1325 social workers\). The model is also an important part of the new **Practice Supervisor Development Programme** *,* an investment by the Department for Education in training for new social work supervisors \(1000 staff in 2019\-20\). 

 **International implementation and impact of the Secure Base model** 

 Schofield and Beek have provided training and support for implementation of the Secure Base model globally, including **Australia, China, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Thailand**, **Ukraine** and **Vietnam**. The *Attachment Handbook* has been translated into **French** and **Italian**, and is being translated into **Greek**, **Japanese** and **Russian.** Online training resources are widely accessed e.g. by 20 different countries in 2018. 

-  **Promoting high\-quality foster care in Europe** \(S7\)** 

 The Secure Base / ‘Trygg Base’ model has been part of **Norway’s** core training for new foster carers since 2008 and used in supervision of carers and staff. Schofield visited Norway biannually during this successful implementation \(2007\-12\) and in 2014 was invited to hold a day workshop for 300 practitioners and foster carers in Oslo. The practice guide was translated into Norwegian \(2015\) and Secure Base foster carer support groups have continued in Norway to 2020. 

 New agencies in Europe continue to approach UEA e.g. from 2020 **Cornerstones Fostering**, in the Netherlands, are implementing the model throughout their organisation, with consultation from Schofield, and have reported, *‘...experiences with Secure Base Teams are very positive and social workers and care professionals feel connected and empowered in their work*.’ 

-  **Deinstitutionalisation in Asia and Europe through developing foster care** \(S8\)** 

 UNICEF estimated in 2017 that at least 2.7 million children were in institutional care. Since 2013 the Secure Base model has been used to support the international goal of de\-institutionalisation. From 2013\-15, Beek worked in **Thailand**, **China** and **Vietnam** with Care for Children, a UK based charity, to develop training materials used by local staff to recruit, train and support local foster carers to care for children. These training programmes have continued in use to 2020. 

 In **Thailand**, the Secure Base model became part of their core foster care training programme, with 29 \(of a total of 30\) government child welfare homes and 786 staff attending Secure Base workshops, including teachers, nurses, psychologists, social workers and government officials. Trainers used a culturally sensitive representation of the Secure Base model to communicate to Thai foster carers. This training has also benefited children in institutional care as well as children moving to foster care, with a residential staff member commenting: ‘ *I learnt a lot in this workshop and I’m going to change the way I care for the children because of it. I know we will be able to use it with the children in the orphanage and when we are giving advice to foster parents.’* 

 In **China**, the Secure Base model became widely used by Care for Children. In 2016, the year after Beek completed work on training programmes, 30 workshops were delivered by local trainers in cities across China for 1,310 foster carers, residential staff and professionals and is now well established. In 2014, the Secure Base model was extended to **Vietnam** and presented by Beek to 200 participants \(government officials, orphanage directors, child protection managers\) at a Conference in Hanoi organized by the Ministry of Labour, Invalid and Social Affairs, UNICEF and Care for Children, chaired by Prince Michael of Kent. The model has been implemented in training local staff, with child welfare homes pioneering the introduction of foster care in Vietnam. 

 From 2016, after consultation with Beek, the Secure Base model was introduced by **Care in Action**, a German based charity, in **Ukraine**, where foster care is promoted as an alternative to institutional care. Care in Action describe this approach on its website \(2019 *\). ‘We have equipped specialists across Ukraine with the internationally recognised Providing a Secure Base model of care, so they can train and support foster parents. Because when children are well cared for they develop the relationships and abilities that will help them to succeed at life.’* Also on the website is a foster carer’s comment: *“After the training I began to analyse myself, my actions and S’s behaviour, and began to change my attitudes. With understanding and calm we found a solution.”* 

 Beek was consulted by colleagues in **India**, after which the Centre of Excellence in the Alternative Care of Children and the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, recommended the Secure Base model in their first national **User Guide on Foster Care \(2018\). 

-  **The** **Secure Base model applied to schools internationally** \(S9\)** 

 Schofield and Beek provided Secure Base training and development in Melbourne \(2016\-17\), influencing foster care, but also education, as this teacher reported: ‘ *The teaching and support staff here have enthusiastically grasped your model and are excitedly developing pragmatic ways in which to engage with our students and help them to trust and feel safe while they are here… we are already seeing results which are observable in our behaviour and attendance records.’*

 1. Summary of the impact 

 In sub\-Saharan African countries like Uganda, smallholder farmers face frequent, severe droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, intensified in recent years because of climate change. These hazards are compounded by plant pests and poor\-quality seed. UEA research into how Uganda’s smallholder farmers perceive risk led to the development of a new agricultural insurance scheme, a public\-private partnership. The scheme now protects about 200,000 smallholder farmers against the major risks to their livelihoods, with demand rapidly rising. This boosts productivity by providing smallholders with the confidence to invest in their farms. Insured farmers increase investment by 60\-100%, which offers a safe way out of poverty and is an important step towards food security for the country. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Sustainably raising agricultural productivity is essential for food security and poverty reduction, especially in sub\-Saharan Africa. This requires substantial investment among farmers, most of them smallholders. In Uganda 1 in 5 of the population of 45 million live in extreme poverty, with poverty concentrated among the 70 per cent whose livelihoods depend on agriculture. Almost all of Uganda’s farmers farm less than 2.5 hectares of land. Underinvestment in farms means food insecurity and poverty keep their productivity low, and farmers on the edge of survival. They face hazards such as droughts, erratic rainfall due to climate change, locust attacks, and counterfeit or damaged seed which fails to germinate. 

 Since 2004 a team from the University of East Anglia led research in Uganda on how farmers cope with these risk factors. Almost 3,000 farmers have taken part in economic experiments and surveys. Together with in\-depth interviews with local experts on agriculture, this provided new insights about how farmers decide on taking risks and how they share risks. 

  

 The first UEA research insight is that farmers only invest what they can afford to lose \[R1, R2 and R3 in Section 3\]. When considering buying better seed or other inputs, they often limit their investment to the cash they have spare. They avoid taking out loans because drought wipes out their harvests approximately one year in six. This means loans cannot be repaid, the bank appropriates their land, and they lose their main livelihood. For farmers on the edge of survival, investment decisions are a matter of life and death. 

 The second UEA research insight is that farmers typically support each other when one of them has a specific need, such as a failed investment. Paradoxically, this discourages investment, as farmers prefer not to expose their peers to their own risks \[R4\].

 4. Details of the impact 

 Together, the two UEA research insights described in Section 2 suggested a specific role for agricultural insurance. Informal insurance \(mutual support\) discourages investment, which points to a role for formal insurance \[R4\]. Formal agricultural insurance could encourage investment, provided all major risks are included \[R1, R2 and R3\]. Yet crop insurance is usually unfeasible for smallholder farmers due to the high costs of claim verification. Weather index insurance \(whereby compensation is based on a weather index correlated with crop growing conditions\) is more feasible, but still leaves major risks such as pests and counterfeit seed uninsured. UEA research thus pointed to weather insurance combined \(‘bundled’\) with protection against these other risks \[S1 and S2 in Section 5\]. 

 Building on these insights, UEA researchers co\-produced risk management solutions, working with government officials, farmers and insurance companies, in three stages of research dissemination described below. These risk management solutions make use of satellite images to offer farmers insurance against droughts and erratic rainfall. Inspired by the UEA research, weather insurance is now offered together with certified seed and other agricultural inputs, so that the major risk factors are taken care of. This gives farmers confidence to invest and provides them with a safe way out of poverty. 

 **Impact 1: The government of Uganda decides to promote agricultural investment through bundled weather index insurance.** 

 **In the first research dissemination stage, UEA research insights were discussed with farmers, field specialists and representatives of government, NGOs and the private sector: about 50 individual meetings between March 2012 and June 2015 and four workshops attended by c.100 people \[S1\]. The discussions focused on the agricultural inputs that weather insurance should be ‘bundled’ with, so that the major risks to crop growing are protected against, and loans for high\-productivity agriculture can be taken out with confidence \[S1, S2\].** A best\-practice analysis of UEA research in Uganda was commissioned by the DFID\-ESRC Growth Research Programme \(DEGRP\) to help other researchers see how they might enhance the impact of their own work. It found that the collaborative, iterative approach taken by UEA researchers helped *‘boost the standing of smallholder farmers in Ugandan policy discussions’* \[S5, p. 8\] and provided evidence to bolster the mission of the country’s leading agricultural consultancy, AT Uganda who set out to promote agricultural innovation in Uganda \[S5, pp. 10\-11\]. This paved the way for the policy impact that resulted for the period 2015\-2020. 

 **In the second research dissemination stage, UEA researchers worked with the Ugandan policy advocacy network PASIC \(Policy Action for Sustainable Intensification of Cropping Systems\), who have a desk in the Ministry of Agriculture, to identify and approach the relevant government officials for influencing policy. This led to the two main government agricultural policy documents for 2015\-2020, the main one of which is the Agricultural Sector Strategic Plan, to draw on UEA research to advocate ‘bundled’ weather index insurance for promoting agricultural investment. The former Senior Policy Analyst for the Ministry of Agriculture, wrote to Verschoor,** ‘“In the original draft of the Agricultural Sector Strategic Plan 2015/6\-20, promoting weather index insurance had not been mentioned as one of the five core activities that will be implemented within the Uganda Climate Smart Agriculture. As a result of your research recommendations, weather index insurance has been incorporated in the final draft. This would not have been possible if you had not shared with us your research recommendations as this provided the necessary evidence to lobby for these changes. \[T\]he role that weather index insurance can play in facilitating the transition \[…\] to progressive farming strategies is \[…\] appearing on Uganda’s policy frameworks on agriculture for the first time as a result of your research recommendations’ \[S3\]. 

 This policy impact required intensive engagement with farmers, field specialists, government officials, insurance experts and other stakeholders. Experts on evidence\-based policy making have noted that the collaborative nature of this approach facilitated impact. The head of the Research and Policy in Development \(RAPID\) programme at the UK’s Overseas Development Institute, writes in a 2019 blog ‘ *A project on farmers’ attitudes towards risk in Uganda \[…\] developed a highly collaborative, iterative approach to engagement, working with farmers, as well as local and national policy makers to co\-create policy proposals that would work at all levels’* \[S4\]. 

 The agriculture theme lead at the DFID\-ESRC Growth Research Programme \(DEGRP\), comments on the unusual care UEA researchers took to tease out policy relevance of their findings: *‘In this case, however, we have a rarity. The study used experimental economics to elicit farmer perceptions of risks in agricultural investment. The researchers next discussed their findings with farmers and field specialists in the locality where they carried out their studies to identify possible practical implications. Then they took those insights to a national dialogue with government, non\-government, donor, academia and private sector stakeholders to consider what might be feasible and promising nationally. So unusual is this process that we asked the team to document in detail what they did’* \[Foreword to S1, p.3\]. 

 **Impact 2: Ugandan insurance companies provide improved weather insurance, with about 200,000 farmers insured in 2020.** 

 **After including the recommendations suggested by UEA research in its 2015\-20 strategy documents, in 2016 the Ugandan government partnered with the Uganda Insurers Association to launch a new agricultural insurance scheme. Ten insurance companies formed the Agriculture Insurance Consortium \(AIC\) to provide the bundled weather insurance that UEA research recommended. The insurance premium is subsidised by the government: smallholder farmers pay 50% of the commercial rate in most of the country, and 20% in particularly drought\-prone areas. By June 2020, 196,991 policies had been sold \[S6\], which is a remarkably rapid market penetration. AIC estimates demand to be 220,000 by the end of 2020 and predicts demand to rise to over 575,000 insured farmers by 2025 \[S6\].** 

 **A Consortium Officer to the AIC explains in a letter to Verschoor what this means for farmers:** “ *To give you a sense of what that means, a typical smallholder farmer insures a harvest value of 250,000 Uganda shillings. The premium on that is 5.5% for weather index insurance and after the subsidy is 2.75%, which comes to 6,875 Uganda shillings. If the satellite shows that a drought causes complete harvest failure, then the farmer will receive 90% of 250,000 Uganda shillings, which is 225,000 Uganda shillings.*” \[S6\] The premium that the farmer pays for protection against drought and ruinous harvest failure of UGX6,875 is 3% of the insurance pay\-out of UGX225,000 received. That pay\-out restores the farmer’s income from crops to 90% of its normal value of UGX250,000. It follows that farmers considering an agricultural investment no longer need to worry about drought. 

 **Impact 3: Insured farmers increase investment by 60\-100%, a safe way out of poverty.** 

 **In the third stage of research dissemination, UEA researchers advised Ugandan insurance companies on the design of new insurance products, focusing on features that, in accordance with UEA research, will encourage smallholder farmers to invest. Insurance company MUA is one of the biggest providers of the new insurance products in Uganda, having insured more than 60,000 farmers to date \[S7\]. MUA’s Head of Agriculture Insurance has assessed the effects on farmers’ investment of the bundled weather insurance products UEA research recommended. She estimates that insured farmers increase investment by between 60 and 100 percent and links this to UEA research: “ **Your research on agricultural investment helped show which kinds of insurance products would be appealing to farmers**” \[S7\].** 

 **An illustration of this is provided by a farmer in Bunamwamba village in Bwikhonge sub county in the Ugandan Bulambuli district, who purchased the new insurance that UEA research recommended. As he puts it, “ **From my perspective, \[the new\] agriculture insurance is beneficial to us farmers because it enables us to borrow money from financial institutions and invest in farming without worrying. When you borrow money to invest in farming and there is a drought, you lose twice; you lose the crops, and you have to sell one of your assets to pay the money you borrowed. But if you have agriculture insurance, it will pay the money you borrowed.**” \[S8, p.12\]** 

 The future looks bright for the new insurance products that UEA research recommended and helped make possible. m\-Omulimisa, a Ugandan agriculture technology company, has started providing the new insurance products in innovative ways, with equally promising effects on investment. Its Managing Director writes to Verschoor: “ *We have developed an app that makes purchase of index insurance extremely easy. We give farmers the opportunity to buy the insurance together with certified, high\-quality agricultural inputs such as seed and fertilizer, as well as to take out an affordable loan \(1.08% interest per month\) for buying these inputs. To make sure that small\-scale farmers are reached, we use a village\-agent model. The village agents have a smart phone that they use to buy bundled insurance \(insurance plus the other things mentioned\) on behalf of the farmers. The model works well. We estimate that farmers double their investment in agricultural inputs as a result of the insurance, which means that the productivity of their farms increases in a safe and sustainable manner.*” \[S9\]

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

-  University of York \(UoY\) research by **Doherty, Harrison**, **Bojke and Hinde**: 

 Through a series of robust observational studies utilising national registry data Doherty and colleagues evaluated cardiac rehabilitation \(CR\) service quality and also determined the extent to which waiting times influenced patient outcomes. Statistical analyses accounted for confounders and used transparent reporting methods: 

 <ins>Study one</ins> applied a new analytical approach utilising national registry data from routine clinical practice to evaluate the extent to which CR programmes met minimum standards and key performance indicators of service quality. This research concluded that in the period 2013 to 2014 only 27 CR programmes \(12%\) met all CR quality criteria and that 5% of programmes failed to meet any of the quality criteria **\(3.1\)**. This approach helped establish the first UK CR service performance categories and directly informed the creation of the National Certification Programme in 2016. 

 <ins>Study two</ins> used logistic and multinomial regression to investigate the influence of CR timing on psychological outcomes in 39,588 post heart attack patients. This was the first study to conclude that longer wait times were associated with less than optimal mental health outcomes **\(3.2\)**. This complemented a previous study published in 2016 \(by Doherty\) confirming the benefits of timely CR on physical fitness and physical activity status. 

-  Doherty was co\-investigator on a National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) programme grant ‘Rehabilitation Enablement in Chronic Heart Failure \(REACH\-HF\)’ that developed and evaluated, through a clinical trial, a new self\-managed home\-based intervention for patients with heart failure. The intervention was developed with patient and carer involvement and was proven to be safe, clinically effective and cost effective. Doherty developed the chair\-based exercise intervention incorporating seven exercise intensity levels quantifying the metabolic costs for each of the exercise levels. He also led the exercise prescription component of REACH\-HF which created a new tailored exercise approach for patients with heart failure. Doherty was principal investigator for the York NHS Hospital trial, one of four sites across the UK that delivered REACH\-HF **\(3.3\)**. 

-  Doherty was one of three co\-leads on a European\-wide project \(Cardiac Rehabilitation Outcome Study\-CROS\) with the Cochrane Group, Heidelberg University. This was the first study to exclude pre\-1995 CR studies as part of their systematic review and meta\-analysis investigating the prognostic effects of CR in the modern era of cardiology. This research, based on a sample size of 232,295 patients, established CR effectiveness but raised serious concerns about the quality of CR interventions included in clinical trials. Through its analysis of registry \(clinically based\) studies, it also highlighted poor quality in CR services as part of routine clinical practice across Europe **\(3.4\)**. 

-  Doherty was co\-investigator on an NIHR programme grant evaluating the effectiveness of psychological interventions through a rigorous clinical trial in patients with depression and anxiety which are conditions known to act as barriers to CR uptake. Doherty was involved in the design, implementation, analysis and dissemination of this research, which proved that CR plus behaviour activation therapy was clinically effective. The group also carried out a novel cost effectiveness systematic review of CR in the modern era of cardiology \(influenced by Doherty’s CROS research\) which informed the first value for money case for CR **\(3.5\)**. 

-  Bojke, Hinde, Doherty and Harrison, supported by NIHR and British Heart Foundation \(BHF\) carried out a de novo approach to health economic modelling using and adapting systematic review evidence combined with National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation \(NACR\) data resulting in the development of a tailored health economic model evaluating increased uptake and health gains by socioeconomic status in cardiac patients attending CR. This research has directly informed the NHS England Long\-term Plan targets and BHF Strategy **\(3.6\)**.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

##  \[Impact I\] Developed clinical standards and National Certification Programme 

1.  Research by Doherty developed key performance indicators and an analytic approach leading to the foundation of a National Certification Programme for CR \(NCP\_CR\). This is run jointly by the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation \(BACPR\) and national audit team **\(3.1 & 3.2\)**. The National Certification Programme monitors and reports on the quality of CR delivery against published clinical minimum standards. Longitudinal national audit data shows that CR quality has improved significantly from only 27 programmes \(12%\) in 2014 to 93 programmes \(42%\) achieving full certification status in 2020 representing a 30% improvement. British Journal of Cardiology \(2016\) **\(5.1a\)**. 

1.  The same research informed clinical standards and core components used by over 230 clinical programmes across the UK. \( **3.1** is reference 81 in the quotation below\): 

 *“The ultimate goal is for all CR programmes to deliver services in line with the Standards and Core Components in this document, however at present most programmes are working towards the minimum standards as outlined in the NCP\_CR.<sup> **81**</sup>” Page 19 BACPR Standards and Core Components \(2017\)* **\(5.1b\)**. 

1.  National reporting of key performance indicators as part of the NCP\_CR showing that the quality of CR has increased since this research was conducted. BHF Quality and Outcomes Report 2020 page 23 \(5.1c\). 

1.  UoY research on the development and success of a national certification programme and minimum standards was viewed, by the European Association for Preventive Cardiology, as the first to implement and evaluate minimum standards which were then used to inform the development and implementation of European standardization and quality improvement of secondary prevention:                                                                                                         *“The use of minimum standards for the evaluation of the quality of CR has been tested elsewhere <sup>21</sup>” Page 2* Standardization and quality improvement of secondary prevention through cardiovascular rehabilitation programmes in Europe: Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2020. Reference 21 in the quote is **3.1, \(5.1d\)**. 

##  \[Impact II\]  Improving national CR wait times and patient outcomes 

1.  Research presented at national and international conferences in 2015 and 2016 showed that timely CR led to improved mental health and physical health outcomes **\(3.2\)**. The BACPR standards writing group reviewed Doherty’s research on waiting times and CR delay and used it to support timely CR as part of their standards. Using published data collected as part of NHS Digital audits the quotation below highlights more than a 50% reduction in waiting times driven by UoY research: 

 *“In 2020, UK median CR wait times have reduced to 33 and 21 days for surgical and non\-surgical patients, respectively. This represents a reduction in waiting time of 21 days for surgical patients and of 19 days for non\-surgical patients compared with 2014 surpassing national targets and yielding significant improvements in service delivery and patient benefit by avoiding delay \(Hinde et al 2020\). This change in clinical practice owes much to sustained BHF\-funded studies at the University of York on wait times. Before these studies, average wait times had only decreased by 2.5 days between 2011 and 2014.”* Page 20 BHF Quality and Outcomes Report 2020 **\(5.2a\)**. 

1.  UoY research on waiting times has continued to inform new versions of clinical standards evidenced by the following quotation where reference 28 in the quotation is our research on the benefits of early CR: “There is continued emphasis on the importance of early CR which is both safe and feasible, and improves patient uptake and adherence.21–28” Page 511 BACPR, Standards and Core Components. Heart 2019;105:510\-515 \( **5.2b\)**. 

1.  The quotation below cites two UoY studies, on the impact of early rehabilitation on psychological outcomes and physical outcomes, as the only references used to inform the decision to include early CR as a minimum standard for CR services across Europe: *“The timing of CR has a significant impact on fitness<sup>53</sup> and psychological outcomes <sup>54</sup>” page 3 of*   Standardization and quality improvement of secondary prevention through cardiovascular rehabilitation programmes in Europe: Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2020 **\(5.2c\)**. 

1.  Beyond the recognised improvement in physical and mental health outcomes for patients, evidenced through UoY research on timely CR, there is also a service level benefit achieved through enhanced uptake. Timely CR increases the likelihood of patients starting whereas delayed CR decreases the likelihood. Health economic modelling of timely CR has quantified a 15.3% benefit in CR uptake \(i.e. \~ 20,786 more patients based on 2019 national audit data\) and improved long\-term health with a cost per quality\-adjusted life\-year of GBP3,286 **\(5.2d\)**. 

##  \[Impact III\] Development and implementation of a new self\-management intervention to address a known gap in CR delivery for patients with heart failure \(HF\). 

1.  The REACH\-HF programme of research including Doherty’s chair based exercise intervention was developed with extensive patient and carer involvement. Clinical and cost effectiveness was established **\(3.3\)** after which REACH\-HF was rolled out through four NHS Beacon sites and four Scottish Health Boards. Roll\-out was supported by NIHR, NHS England/Scotland. NHS Digital also introduced REACH\-HF as a new mode of delivery option in Jan 2019 allowing clinicians to routinely record this intervention as part of an NHS provision. The REACH\-HF service implementation approach, outlined above, won the BMJ Services Award for Stroke and Cardiovascular Services in 2020 **.** The BMJ award recognised REACH\-HF for its excellence in healthcare provision and for successfully implementing leading research into NHS clinical practice **\(5.3a\)**. 

1.  REACH\-HF was adopted by the South West Academic Health Sciences Network **\(5.3b\)**. 

1.  The REACH\-HF intervention was adopted nationally by the BHF and BACPR as part of the Covid\-19 initiative to enable older patients with heart failure to exercise safely at home. In response to Covid\-19 NHS service changes and an urgent need for online training of NHS staff, Doherty and REACH\-HF colleagues changed their face\-to\-face facilitator course to online training. In doing so they successfully delivered training to 100 staff leading to an increase in home\-based CR services in the UK. Doherty also adapted his chair based exercise programme making it freely available to NHS staff and patients online. National audit data pre\-Covid \(2019\) vs Covid era \(2020\) confirms that the proportion of patients with heart failure taking up hospital\-based CR dropped by 47% whereas home\-based CR increased by 52%. Based on the success of our Covid\-19 response along with development and implementation of online training for NHS staff, NICE endorsed REACH\-HF as a quality assured shared learning example under the theme of Covid\-19\-ready\-rehabilitation\-for\-heart\-failure **\(5.3c\)**. 

##  \[Impact IV\] Policy and practice: NHS Long\-term Plan; British Heart Foundation Strategy and international clinical guidance. 

1.  In 2019 UoY researchers \(Doherty, Harrison, Hinde, Bojke\) were asked by NHS England and BHF executives to investigate, as part of NHS Long\-term Plan preparations, the cost benefit of increasing CR uptake. Our findings and calculations \( **3.6** also incorporating **3.5** in the cost analysis\), were used to aid decision making and set targets as part of the NHS Long\-term Plan and BHF Strategy: 

 *“Scaling up and improving marketing of cardiac rehabilitation to be amongst the best in Europe will prevent up to 23,000 premature deaths and 50,000 acute admissions over 10 years”  \(Page 63 section 3.72 of the Long Term Plan\)* **\(5.4a\)**. 

 BHF strategy document \(The Big Picture 2018\) used our research findings and UoY based National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation data to set its 65% and 85% targets: *“Achieving an uptake rate of 65% would result in 8,500 fewer deaths and 21,000 fewer hospital readmissions over 10 years. And reaching 85% uptake could save a remarkable 20,000 lives and avoid nearly 50,000 admissions over the next decade, as well as saving the NHS tens of millions of pounds. Source: Hinde S, Bojke L, Harrison A, Doherty P. \(2018\) Modelling of potential CR uptake scenarios for the BHF vs 2015/16 NACR data”* Page 3 **\(5.4a\)**. 

1.  Our joint European collaborative research project entitled Cardiac Rehabilitation Outcome Study \(CROS\) was used to inform Scottish National Clinical Guidance SIGN 150: 

 *“While CR meets the definition of a complex intervention, with studies including some or all of the elements described in the BACPR pathway, systematic reviews have concluded that the reduction in cardiovascular mortality associated with attending CR can be attributed to the exercise component.<sup>5,6</sup>”* Page 1, Reference 6 is **3.4**, **\(5.4b\)**. 

 The CROS project systematic review and meta\-analysis also informed European standards on the ability of CR to benefit patients by reducing premature death: 

 *“Previous data, including recent meta\-analysis have shown the efficacy of CR <sup>3</sup><sup>,5</sup><sup>–7</sup> to reduce mortality”* Page 2, reference 5 is **3.4**, **\(5.4b\)**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers in the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute \(HCRI\) carried out a series of projects about emergency medical responses to sudden onset disasters, with a focus on the collection, preservation and ownership of medical data. The team’s findings informed *World Health Organization* \(WHO\) guidelines for Emergency Medical Teams \(EMTs\), first published in 2013, which set the standards now used to validate EMTs globally. Drawing on the research, HCRI staff established \(2016\) and trained the UK EMT through UK\-Med, a closely associated Non\-Governmental Organisation \(NGO\). HCRI led programmes of work to support EMTs in several countries to reach the standards required for WHO validation. The research led to HCRI’s designation in 2016 as a collaborating centre of the WHO, through which it carries out activities in support of WHO programmes. In 2020 this designation was extended to 2022. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The impact is underpinned by a sequence of interrelated research projects on medical data and EMTs carried out by HCRI researchers since 2010. 

##  Medical Responses to Sudden Onset Disasters 

 In 2010, HCRI collaborated with the NGO Handicap International to examine anonymised medical records relating to amputation rates in the context of the January 2010 Haiti earthquake. The chaos that followed the major earthquake in Port\-au\-Prince resulted in a multidisciplinary investigation bringing together medical staff from HCRI \(Redmond\), NGO staff \(Calvot, Duttine\) and humanities researchers \(Taithe\). The team addressed the effectiveness of over 300 emergency humanitarian medical responses \(now referred to as Emergency Medical Teams, or EMTs\) to sudden onset disasters. 

 The research \[1\] illuminated significant factors undermining an effective treatment of the traumatic injuries Haitians suffered during the earthquake. These factors included: the unreliability of medical data; that patients had limited ownership of their own medical records; and that field report statistics were inflated and unreliable because of both their ignorance of, and incapacity to accommodate, the agency of patients. Most foreign medical teams \(with the exception of a handful of NGOs such as Médecins Sans Frontières \(MSF\) or the Cuban medical teams\) produced inadequate and unreliable data. Cross\-examining statistical evidence with a qualitative survey of 87 patients, the research demonstrated that patient understandings of care differed significantly from the reports given by medical teams. Through qualitative work with amputees, the research demonstrated that many had managed their own treatment and self\-referred. It also established: i\) the need to develop a validated international control on emergency medical teams, a call for which was published in *The Lancet* \[2\]; and ii\) the need to reassess the manner in which medical data was collected, preserved and owned in sudden onset disaster settings \[1\]. 

 The WHO did not have established minimum standards for health service provision, for the collection of medical data, or reporting systems for medical responses to sudden onset disasters at that time. The policy\-focused research \[1, 2\] led the WHO to establish a Foreign Medical Team \(FMT\) Working Group in 2011 \( [https://www.who.int/hac/global\_health\_cluster/fmt/en/](https://www.who.int/hac/global_health_cluster/fmt/en/)\) that recognised the problems epitomised in the Haiti response and responded to the call in *The Lancet* \[2\]. Hughes and Redmond were invited to participate in the international working group, resulting in recommendations supported by HCRI research, including an initial classification system for FMTs \(later renamed EMTs\) that establishes minimum professional standards \[see also section 4\]. 

##  Improving Medical Record Data 

 Further research \[3\] exposed the need to reassess the manner in which medical data was collected, preserved and owned in sudden onset disaster settings. It argued for the standardisation of the content of medical records kept by FMTs in sudden onset disasters to ensure that robust follow\-up arrangements are documented and meet the minimum standards for FMT practice. In the years that followed, HCRI staff conducted research into improving medical record data. This research: 

-  Developed and tested a minimum summary sheet for sudden onset disasters \[4\]; 

-  Proposed a three\-step operational learning framework that could be used for EMTs globally. The proposed framework includes the following steps: 1\) ensure professional competence and license to practice; 2\) support adaptation of technical and non\-technical professional capacities into the low\-resource and emergency context; and 3\) prepare for an effective team performance in the field \[5\]. 

-  Concluded that the principles of the NHS emergency care data set apply in a disaster response and should be used in EMT electronic patient record structures \[6\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 HCRI research findings have made a substantial contribution to the establishment of new norms and standards for the validation and training of EMTs authorised internationally to deploy and register in another country to deliver post\-disaster healthcare. Prior to 2013, foreign improvised response teams often arrived suddenly in countries where a disaster had occurred \(e.g. the Haiti earthquake and Pakistan floods in 2010\). These medical teams were unverified as to their equipment, training or skills. They could add to the confusion and stress of difficult times and left poor evidence of their interventions on patients. The paucity of data and inadequate medical records had lifelong consequences for the victims of disasters \[1, 2\], such as inadequate rehabilitation or loss of legal redress for malpractice. 

 The impact of the research is demonstrated in three areas: \(1\) Informing WHO policymaking on EMTs; \(2\) Creating and training the UK EMT; and \(3\) International training and validation of EMTs. 

##  1. Informing WHO policymaking on EMTs 

 In response to the research in Haiti \[1, 2\], the WHO invited Hughes and Redmond to contribute their research to an initiative to develop a classification system and set minimum standards for EMTs. This initiative produced benchmarks for international teams, published in 2013 and revised since as the ‘Classification and Minimum Standards for Foreign Medical Teams in Sudden Onset Disaster’ \(the ‘Blue Book’\) \[A\], citing \[1\]. HCRI research shaped the content of this field\-guide document, which has been applied and used globally throughout the assessment period. The contribution of HCRI research is recognised in the acknowledgements of the Blue Book \[A, p. 7\], and in the fact that the Book responded to all the demands of the 2011 call published in *The Lancet* \[2\]. 

 Following this normative phase in 2013, HCRI research subsequently shaped the WHO Working Groups for EMT Training and contributed to the process of developing a template for a minimum data set and uniform reporting system in disaster zones. This work continues to inform ongoing revisions of the EMT guidelines today \[e.g. activity reported in B\]. 

 In recognition of this work, HCRI was granted the status of a WHO Collaborating Centre for the Humanitarian Policy and Guidance unit in the Emergency Operations Department at WHO for a period of 4 years from 2016 \[C.i\]. The status recognises the significance of the research \[including 3, 4, 5 and 6\] and the role of HCRI in supporting WHO programmes. HCRI is the only existing collaborating centre of the 57 UK centres to be based in a faculty of humanities. The 2016 terms of reference for this partnership \[C.i\] specifically outlined areas for HCRI to conduct research and support the WHO in key areas of interest to its operational work\-plan, including EMT data, training, capacity building, research into the effectiveness of EMTs, and the quality of and accountability for the medical data EMTs generate \[5, 6\]. In January 2020, this status was renewed until 2022 \[C.ii\], even though at this time the WHO reduced the number of collaborating centres worldwide to 800 \[C.iii\]. 

##  2. Creating and training the UK EMT 

 The research informed the creation of the UK EMT, founded in 2016 as a partnership between the former UK Department for International Development \(DFID\), the NHS, Public Health England, Handicap International, the UK Fire and Rescue Service and UK\-Med. HCRI’s research continues to underpin the UK EMT’s work. UK\-Med \( [https://www.uk\-med.org/](https://www.uk-med.org/)\) is a medical NGO, formerly directed by Redmond and hosted in HCRI since 2013, which prepares medical teams to respond to sudden onset disasters and provides training for healthcare workers in countries at high risk of disease outbreaks, conflict or natural disasters. UK\-Med and HCRI have a formal agreement to collaborate on research and training \[D.i\]. Through the UK\-Med/HCRI partnership, research on EMTs carried out by HCRI staff continuously informs UK\-Med training and operations \(approximately 1,100 UK clinicians trained \[D.ii\]\). In 2016, UK\-Med was awarded a large DFID five\-year contract of approximately GBP8,000,000 to train and recruit staff for the national UK EMT in collaboration with HCRI \[D.iii\]. Each year UK\-Med rotates six teams of 60 clinicians who are on\-call for a period of two months \[D.iv\]. The teams have been deployed to disaster and disease outbreak responses, including the response to the Cyclone in Mozambique in 2019 and the COVID\-19 response in 2020 \[D.v\]. 

 The work since 2016 built on UK\-Med’s central contribution to the UK Ebola Response in Sierra Leone Programme in 2014. In 2016, Hughes was awarded an MBE in recognition for her work in leading UK\-Med trained NHS volunteers in Ebola response in West Africa and was named a ‘Point of Light’ by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015 \[D.vi\]. 

 In 2016, the WHO launched its global classification process and Global EMT list. Managed by the WHO EMT Secretariat, the process allows EMTs to register for mentoring and eventually to be classified as internationally deployable. In the same year, the UK EMT was one of the first teams to be verified by the WHO \[E\], having met the standards required to deploy a full field hospital \(type\-2\) to a sudden onset disaster using the framework developed as a result of the research \[5\]. In all recent deployments, HCRI’s research \[particularly 4 and 6\] has informed the practices and recording processes of the UK EMT. 

##  3. International training and validation of EMTs 

 Following the pioneering validation of the UK EMT, in 2016 HCRI established a collaboration with the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine \(HKAM\) to develop a research agenda on EMTs and a training programme to support Chinese EMTs to meet the WHO standards \[F.i\]. Through the dual focus of this partnership, HCRI’s earlier EMTs research \[1, 2, 3\] shaped training and the development of standards, which, in turn, led to the further development and application of research on EMTs through wider collaboration. The project with HKAM both contributed to the research for outputs \[4\], \[5\] and \[6\] and had a significant impact on training. Using HCRI processes and research\-based guidelines, between 2016 and 2018 HCRI and UK\-Med trained 431 medical staff in mainland China and 118 in Hong Kong \[F.ii\]. This programme included an EMT training event in Dali, China, in September 2017, which involved team leaders from the 37 Chinese national EMTs \(91 participants\) \[F.ii\]. Training events for West China Hospital took place in February and April 2018 \(total participants 219\) \[F.ii\], providing technical support and full field hospital simulation pre\-deployment training \[F.iii\] in preparation for verification by WHO. The West China Hospital EMT was verified by WHO later in 2018 \[F.iv\]. 

 The partnership also established a significant role for the HKAM\-HCRI team in the WHO EMT network at Secretariat level, through taking up a Working Member role in the WHO EMT Training Working Group \[F.ii\]. This Group aimed to develop a set of standardised guidelines for developing the training plan of EMTs. Redmond participated in Working Group meetings in April and September 2017 \[F.ii\], which generated a standardised list of training topics and subtopics for EMTs globally for the 26 EMTs classified and 70 EMTs working towards classification. 

 Between 2017 and 2019, HCRI took up a leading role in the Training for Emergency Medical Teams and European Medical Corps \(TEAMS\) project \[G.i\]. TEAMS was an EC\-funded consortium which researched, developed, piloted and assessed a standardised, cost\-effective and sustainable operational training package for different types of EMTs within low\-income countries. The resulting TEAMS Training Package, which is underpinned by the findings in \[5\], was endorsed by the WHO EMT Secretariat in 2019 \[G.ii\]; WHO is preparing to roll out the training package from 2021. 

 In January 2020, WHO directors for the AFRO region of the UN organisation invited HCRI and UK\-Med to contribute to the development of African EMTs, with a focus on outbreaks. The renewal of HCRI’s status as a Collaborating Centre of the WHO in January 2020 \[C.ii\] ensures the continuation of research impact that corresponds closely to field\-based realities as well as WHO regional priorities. HCRI work has thus had impact at an international level through WHO, nationally in the UK, internationally in China and Hong Kong and Africa since Ebola.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Despite an aging population, both in the UK and globally, the built environments older people live in are often unfriendly, unfamiliar and inaccessible. *Older People’s Use of Unfamiliar Space \(OPUS\)* has had a significant impact on the way people look at the built environment. Both nationally and internationally, this change in understanding has resulted in concrete measures to improve accessibility for older people. Councils, national governments and international organisations, i.e. the European Commission and the WHO in Europe, have all included OPUS as the basis or evidence for policy regarding age\-friendly built environments. In addition, OPUS has underpinned Public Health England efforts to encourage physical activity in older people. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since the release of the Active Ageing Framework in 2002 by the World Health Organization \(WHO\), increasing attention has been paid to the specific needs of older persons. 

 Previous research has shown that growing older in familiar places, otherwise known as ‘ageing in place’, can mitigate deterioration in cognitive and physical ability. Much of this research has focused on the environments of and around older people’s residential accommodation. Less attention has been given to their experience of communal outdoor spaces, such as town centres, even as older people increasingly have the means and health to travel to new, unfamiliar environments. 

 Research by Walford and colleagues at Kingston University sought to understand how older people respond to unfamiliar environments by identifying triggers influencing their experience. The research project, entitled *Older People’s Use of Unfamiliar Space \(OPUS\)*, was funded through and  [published](http://www.newdynamics.group.shef.ac.uk/assets/files/NDA%20Findings_4.pdf) by the UK Research Councils’ *New Dynamics of Ageing* \(NDA\) *Programme* **\[R1\]**, in collaboration with Swansea University, and resulted in research outputs. 

 Uniting the different backgrounds of the researchers, which ranged from Walford’s focus on spatial data, to Samarasundera’s geographical focus, to Pratt’s work with film, OPUS built on conceptual aspects of environmental gerontology **\[R2\]** to adopt a mixed methods approach to investigate older people’s experiences of unfamiliar spaces. The researchers focused on understanding older people’s responses to these spaces in terms of accessibility, design quality, and walkability \(ease of navigation and wayfinding\). The OPUS project involved over 40 older participants, and their response to an unfamiliar environment – Colchester **.** In preparation, the Kingston team undertook urban design and walkability audits in situ. 

 All participants individually viewed a 31\-minute, filmed walking route round Colchester town centre in a 3D ‘virtual reality cave’. Questionnaires were used to assess cognitive variability. Participants watched the 31 minute filmed walking route around Colchester town centre, narrating their response which was captured on a digital recorder, while their physical responses were also monitored. The quality of the built environment was measured using these narratives and recorded physical responses. 12 participants visited Colchester and its town centre, where they explored the environment independently, and met with local older residents and town planners. These participants worked with members of the Kingston team to validate the urban design quality and walkability assessment audits. **\[R3, R4\]** 

 Analysis of these interrelated and integrated datasets \- the oral narratives; physiological measurements; street walkability and urban design audits; and the participant survey \- in combination and separately \- has been published in several research outputs. 

 The research determined that age\-friendly urban design features: 

-  Sightlines to buildings and other landmarks, especially those of historical significance. These are important navigational aids which assist wayfinding and with developing a rudimentary mental image of unfamiliar town centres **\[R2, R4\]** 

-  Signage in town centres and at key transport hubs. These should be positioned appropriately for older people and importantly indicate both distance and typical walking time to the destination **\[R4, R5\]**. 

 The research determined that more walkable built environments would feature: 

-  Easily navigable urban outdoor spaces. These are less stressful and more accessible from both emotional and physiological perspectives **\[R3, R5\]**. 

-  Familiar town centre brands \(e.g. national retailers\). These help to make unfamiliar environments less stressful as they can provide a psychological connection with familiar urban spaces **\[R4, R5\]**. 

 Interaction between older visitors to the town and similarly aged locals. This can help to clarify uncertainties over accepted norms in the navigation of such environments **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The OPUS project has had a significant impact on urban design policy at local, national and international levels: beginning with the local council in Colchester, where the research took place, its findings have been taken up by a range of bodies in the UK and across Europe. This has benefitted more and more older people, as planning and design policy has taken their experiences into account.<ins> **Councils’ Local Planning**</ins>OPUS’ findings first impacted spatial planning and design at the council level, raising awareness of the accessibility needs of older people as they navigate town centres, particularly in ageing societies. Local authorities have increasingly acknowledged that good urban design standards consider not only physical accessibility of buildings and other infrastructure, but also take account of mobility and navigation for all through public spaces. In their Better Town Centre plan, Colchester Borough Council used the OPUS project as a core evidence base to guide for planning policy for the town centre. They stated ‘ *New wayfinding measures will be informed by the findings of research involving older people’s use of Colchester’*; their policy documents link to and name the OPUS project. The plan also incorporated OPUS’ findings on the need to highlight landmarks and for the correct positioning of signage **\[S1\]**. First adopted as planning guidance in 2012, this document continues to provide ‘ *guidance on the Council’s planning policies and process’*, in determining planning applications **\[S1\]**. The OPUS study also features as part of the evidence base informing the Environment aspect of the council’s Emerging Local Plan 2017 – 2033 **\[S1\]**. 

 In October 2013, North Somerset Council Access Officer Anthony Rylands uploaded NDA4\-OPUS to the Design Standards \(Environment\) space, ranking it as ‘useful’ **\[S2\]**. In 2014 the North Somerset Council produced ‘People with Dementia and the Physical Environment’ to highlight issues that urban designers needed to consider **\[S2\]**. In this document, the Equality and Diversity team cited and applied the OPUS findings, stating that ‘ *landmarks are important navigational aids’* and requiring townscape designers to consider people’s mental maps and reactions to unfamiliar cues. <ins> **Activity for Age\-Friendly Nations**</ins> 

 In 2015, Age Cymru, a national charity working to improve the lives of all older people in Wales, explicitly drew attention to the work of the OPUS project. A citation was included in their response to the Welsh Government’s consultation document ‘Design in the Planning Process’, thus using the OPUS project to inform the policy debate **\[S3\]**. Informed by this consultation, the Welsh government decided to keep mandatory Design and Access statements for urban areas, with guidance that makes note of wayfinding systems and emphasises inclusive design principles. Shining a light on the built environment in Welsh communities in 2016, further evidence was drawn by Age Cymru from OPUS to promote accessible and inclusive age\-friendly environments **\[S4\]**. 

 The results of the OPUS study have been used a number of times by the U.K. Government: 

-  In September 2014, Public Health England \(PHE\) drew from OPUS in their Everybody Active, Every Day \- an implementation and evidence guide to address the nation’s inactivity epidemic. It used OPUS findings to support its claims that local government had the responsibility to regulate, lead on and design age\-friendly, healthy environments which promote a feeling of safety and security **\[S5\].** 

-  In March 2015, the Government Office for Science \(GO\-Science\) commissioned a Foresight evidence review about mobility and ageing **\[S6\]**. Citing OPUS **\[R2\]**, they stressed the importance of ‘ *the meanings and values attached to places and the perceptions of an environment that can give people confidence in a place*’. GO\-Science recommended that ‘ *mobility policies should be sensitive to’ the diversity of different age groups*’ and that the ‘ *design of the built environment can enable older people to access their neighbourhood*’. In 2016, The ‘Future of an Ageing Population’ final report, for which the evidence was purposed, listed as a key finding that ‘ *A well\-designed built environment can maximise the physical mobility of older people*’ **\[S7\]**. 

-  In July 2016, Nazhut Ali, PHE Lead, Older Adults, Health and Well Being, drew the link between access and activity in her presentation ‘Older People and Physical Activity Outdoors’ at a seminar day for academic, government and third sector organisations **\[S8\]**. Noting how regular physical activity can reduce many physical and mental diseases, medical visits, and social isolation, Ali critiqued the barriers preventing older people from accessing the outdoors, citing OPUS **\[R4\]**. This demonstrates how PHE’s strategy for activity is underpinned by OPUS’ findings about quality of access. 

-  In June 2017, GO\-Science furthered this access agenda by releasing workshop materials to support policymakers, such as the Scottish government’s Strategy Unit, to produce new policy recommendations. These materials cite the original evidence review **\[S6\]**, emphasising that ‘ *access is a key component*’ of neighbourhoods’ maximising their contribution to older people’s wellbeing. 

 Policy makers in the UK have, from the findings of OPUS, learnt about and promoted age\-inclusive design for a demographically ageing country. Through this strategic direction, OPUS has supported the well\-being and independence for older people throughout the country. 

 <ins> **International Policy for Ageing Populations**</ins> 

 A 2017 joint project between the European Commission’s Directorate\-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and the WHO Regional Office for Europe published, in 2018, the policy action handbook ‘Age\-friendly environments in Europe’ **\[S9\]**. Written primarily for local politicians, regional authorities, planners, and representatives of older people, this handbook cites OPUS frequently in the section ‘Urban environments that support belonging, continuity and sense of self’ and the subsection describing the important impact of feelings upon the use of place. Recommendations from this section to EU member states include five policy interventions and initiatives for local action plans. These work towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 – making cities safe and accessible for the elderly. 

 The project also stimulated public debate over various assumptions about elderly people. Guardian columnist Michele Hanson opened up a public dialogue about the NDA findings, including the OPUS results that urban space can be a ‘worrisome environment, and doesn’t always do your cardiac function much good’ **\[S10\],** resulting in a widely commented discussion. OPUS has provided an evidence base and a framework for policy makers to transform this ‘worrisome environment’.
