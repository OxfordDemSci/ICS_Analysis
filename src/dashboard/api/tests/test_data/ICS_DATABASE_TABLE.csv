###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Photography is a powerful medium for engaging modern audiences with difficult pasts. But when it comes to the Holocaust, photography is often used in counter\-productive ways. Umbach’s research has highlighted the problems of relying overwhelmingly on perpetrator photography in modern pedagogic and curatorial practice, and provided solutions for a more productive use of visual materials, which foregrounds the experience and dignity of victims, and enables empathy. The research has transformed how leading Holocaust museums, creative artists and contemporary audiences in the UK, Germany and the US use photography. This change in practice means that museums now: 

-  avoid inadvertently reproducing and perpetuating the racist bias of Nazi photographers, but foreground perspective of the victims 

-  empower audiences to develop a critical visual literacy, and transfer this to contemporary photos of victims of violence and persecution. 

-  provided digital tools for commemoration of Holocaust at a generational turn when survivor voices are disappearing and Holocaust misinformation is rife.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research has been led by Maiken Umbach, a historian of modern Germany with expertise in the interpretation of visual sources. It both led to the development of, and is now being undertaken within, an AHRC\-funded research project on ‘Photography as Political Practice in National Socialism’ **\[3.4\]** of which she is the PI, as well as associated follow\-on funding for ‘Understanding and Improving Public Engagement with Holocaust Photography’ **\[3.5\].** The research explores the role of photographs, public and private, during Nazi rule, and demonstrates how **perpetrators, bystanders,** and **victims** of the regime used this medium to re\-invent individual and collective **identities** and convey them for contemporary and anticipated future audiences. Further impact work has generated data **\[5.6\]** that now offers an empirical base for understanding the **negative impact** on modern audiences of a one\-sided **reliance** on **Nazi photography** to commemorate and teach about the Holocaust. 

 Challenging existing notion of Nazi visual culture as top\-down propaganda, a 2015 *Central European History* special issue edited by Umbach **\[3.1\]** made the case for using photos not just as illustrations of historical events, but as an exercise of **power** – and the resistance to power – in its own right. Umbach and team then worked with curators and creative practitioners, to develop new ways of representing and exhibiting this difficult history visually. 

 Building on these foundations, subsequent research explored each dimension in more detail. In their 2018 monograph *Photography, Migration, and Identity: A German\-Jewish\-American Story* **\[3.2\]** Umbach and PhD student Sulzener demonstrated how **private Jewish photos** were central to resisting the prescribed racial separation of German and Jewish identities. Jewish photos, precisely because they were also eminently ‘German’ photos, were a means for Jewish citizens to defend and reassert their place in German culture and society, from which the Nazi regime sought to exclude them. Umbach’s PhD student Tofts, on a CDA with the Imperial War Museum \(IWM\) **\[3.6\]** is now using this approach to analyse the museum’s collection of private Jewish photos, and make them usable for galleries and education activities at IWM. 

 The 2019 volume *Private Life and Privacy in Nazi Germany* **\[3.3**\], which emerged from a collaborative research project between Umbach, Harvey and the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich **\[3.7\]**, made the case that making **private photography** a **central source** for both academic and public histories of Nazism not only allows us to consider the perspectives of victims, but also to better understand the **motivation of ordinary German civilian and military perpetrators**, who used the camera to perform and celebrate their own role in Nazi rule, the war effort, and racial politics. 

 Together, these findings have had transformative effects on Holocaust education and exhibition practice. By using photography to demonstrate the full spectrum of German and Jewish identities, we enable audiences to start to see beyond **faceless**, **nameless**, **generic** ‘victims’. These effects have been enhanced by the fact that Umbach, supported in the two AHRC funded projects she leads by Nottingham\-based colleagues G Mills \(School of Education\), S Benford and P Tennent \(School of Computer Science\), and J Stafford \(History and Media Studies\), has conducted further research on **visitor observations** **\[5.6\]**, which reveals how resources and exhibitions based on their historical research **elicit radically different responses from modern viewers** compared to the photos that dominate Holocaust museums and school textbooks to date. Graphic images of violence elicit ‘empathy’ from only 2.5% of viewers, private Jewish photos prompt empathetic questions about the individuality of victims, and their lives before and after victimisation. While the publication of the visitor research is forthcoming, Umbach and her team have already co\-produced exhibitions and shared the observation data with museum partners, which, as they testify, has enhanced a shared sense of significance and urgency in adopting the findings of our historical research for commemorative and pedagogic practice.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Understanding and remembering the Holocaust is vital to guarding against the continuing and resurgent dangers of **anti\-Semitism, racism** and **conspiracy theories**, which currently plague political culture in the UK and much of the developed world. Photos of Holocaust victims – being deported, incarcerated and terrorized in ghettos, arriving in camps – powerfully draw modern viewers into the topic. But these photos are not neutral documents: they are overwhelmingly ‘perpetrator photos’, contrasting triumphant Germans with humiliated and dishevelled, sometimes ragged and half\-starved victims **\[3.1, 3.3\]**. Today, such photos may elicit pity – but they do not necessarily create **empathy**; inadvertently, they may trigger **aversion** or even perpetuate and re\-inscribe the very stereotypes they are supposed to warn against **\[3.2, 5.6\]**. Umbach and her team, consisting of academic colleagues, PhD students and early career researchers, have addressed this challenge over the past five years. Their research on the opportunities and ethical pitfalls of remembering the Holocaust through photography has led to the development of new **pedagogic** methods and **creative** and **curatorial practices**, in five stages: 

 1. Working with the **National Holocaust Centre and Museum \(NHCM\),** the team identified and addressed key pedagogic challenges in Holocaust education through films and providing educational materials. 

 2. The team **co\-curated** **a touring exhibition** with five partner museums in the UK, which introduced new curatorial methods and media, including Virtual Reality, for displaying Holocaust photos, and rigorously assessed **audience responses**. 

 3. The team shaped the practice of artists to harness the power of **creative representations** to change the way audiences imagine, relate to and learn from this past. 

 4. The team pioneered new methods of digital audience engagement for museum partners during the Covid epidemic, creating interactive **online alternatives** to physical museum displays, and again evaluated audience responses. 

 5. The findings from the above enabled new partners to adapt our approach, resulting in transformative effects on curatorial, pedagogic and collection approaches and the new Holocaust Galleries of the **IWM London**, in their own network of museum partnerships, and at the **Austrian Museum of Ethnography**. 

 The team’s research **<ins>shaped curation practice and museum education at the NHCM,**</ins> first through an AHRC\-funded cultural engagement fellowship won in 2016 by Umbach and her PhD student Stiles. NHCM is England's only dedicated Holocaust museum, with c 30,000 yearly visitors. With the NHCM’s education team, we assessed the existing pre\- and post\-visit materials for school groups, and on this basis, co\-created **four short films** about how to view Holocaust photos as part of learning, which are now shown on the museum’s monitors, and which they then used for workshops at the NHCM with hard\-to\-reach demographics **\[5.1\]**, as well as staff training to improve the guided tours they provide for 24,000 pupils annually. 

 This research underpinned NHCM’s successful bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund to **re\-model** their permanent Holocaust exhibition. To translate the research into an exhibition designs, in 2018, the NHCM became project partners on the AHRC project **‘Photography as Political Practice in National Socialism’**, enabling them fundamentally to re\-think their approach to visual sources, and bring their use into line with the institution’s ethos to foreground victims’ voices and perspectives. As the Director of Education at NHCM, states: “ *The collaboration has had a significant impact on the strategic work of the Centre in progressing both our approach to photography as we undertake planning for site re\-development, and expanding our audience reach*.” **\[5.1\]**. 

 Winning additional Arts Council England funding in 2019, Umbach and educators from NHCM co\-created the exhibition **“The Eye as Witness: Recording the Holocaust”**, which sensitises audiences to the problem of perpetrator photography, and places victims’ own photos **\[3.2\]** at the centre of historical representation. It includes a Mixed Reality experience that invites visitors to “step into” a Nazi trophy photograph taken in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943. Inside the immersive virtual space, and thus on the other side of the camera lens, visitors viscerally experience photography as an exercise of power, and explore what was left out and why. The exhibition then shows secret photos taken by persecuted individuals, and prompts visitors to apply what they have learnt to contemporary issues: on an interactive screen, they record their thoughts on which photos do justice to the perspective, agency, and dignity of victims of persecution and state violence, historically and today. In this way, it “ *is a concrete demonstration of the **synergy** between \[NHCM’s\] work with survivor testimony, and Maiken’s research on the ideological significance of perspective in photography*.” The NHCM team have gone on to change how they use photography in all their programmes. **\[5.1\]**. 

 New curatorial methods utilising virtual reality have **improved visitor experience** and deepened their **engagement**. Evaluation covering different demographics attending the exhibition at venues ranging from South Hampstead Synagogue to the Bradford Peace Museum show that the audiences **\[5.6\]**: **\(1\)** learnt to **engage critically** with photographic bias in Holocaust representations. **\(2\)** While only 2.5% of respondents recorded empathy as a response to graphic images that show emaciated or dead victims, exhibition goers engaging also with Jewish photography displayed high degrees of empathy, and an ability to see the victims in terms of individual life stories transcending the situation of their victimisation. **\(3\)** Exhibition goers applied this sharpened sense of **critical visuality** to contemporary photos of ethnic violence and refugees \(from Sudan, Melilla, and the US\-Mexican border\), overwhelmingly arguing that sensitive portraits of individual survivors were more appropriate to the dignity of victims than sensationalist and graphic press photos. 

 Beyond the tangible change to the audience’s ability to engage with the difficult content, the new curatorial and engagement approach triggered a global media response. Media coverage of “The Eye as Witness” reached **148 million** people globally **\[5.5\];** including newspapers, television, and radio. ‘BBC Radio 4’s ‘Front Row’ was particularly struck by “ *photographs taken, at enormous risk, by the inmates of the ghettoes and camps. \[…\] They reveal, amidst degradation and evil, a zest for life, humanity and love.’*’ **\[5.5\]** 

 The exhibition and its coverage enabled NHCM to develop **new partnerships** with the IWM North, Bradford Peace Museum, National Memorial Arboretum, the Jewish Museum London, and the Djanogly Art Gallery Nottingham. The tour was suspended due to Covid in March 2020, but will resume when COVID restrictions are lifted later in 2021. Its impact on NHCM has already been significant in terms of strategy and new partnerships: “ *The exhibition has helped to drive forward the work of the Centre. In conceptual discussions, we grappled with the ethical and audience\-based questions of combining a multi\-media approach with a focus on artefacts and individual testimonies. These discussions were invaluable in framing the **strategic considerations** of site **re\-development**. The opportunity \[…\] enabled the development of **partnerships** with hosting venues – including the Jewish Museum London, and South Hampstead Synagogue. These partnerships will be vital in helping us realise our ambition to achieve a truly nation\-wide reach, and \[…\] will act as the foundation of a programme of **co\-created exhibitions** with partner organisations*” **\[5.1\]**. Moreover, the visitor evaluation data has also **informed** the sector more widely. **IWM** consider it an “ *example of best practice in digital innovation”* and have used it to inform **training** for museum staff in their “ *Second World War and Holocaust Partnership Programme’’,* an NLHF funded project with eight museums across the UK exploring with new audiences, diverse stories connected to these histories, which involved at its first meeting a tour of the exhibition and a discussion of visitor feedback **\[5.7\]**. In March 2020, Umbach met with Lord Pickles to discuss the use of photos in the Learning Centre of the planned **National Holocaust Memorial** in Westminster **\[5.10\]**. Pickles then requested a copy of the visitor observation data evaluation report **\[5.6\]**, in order to inform the curatorial approach to the NHM. 

 <ins> **Restoring Access during Covid\-19.**</ins> The pandemic necessitated a new approach. NHCM and Umbach’s team created an **interactive digital** version of EAW **.** Funded by an AHRC follow\-on grant, research based on visitor observations from the physical and virtual versions confirm the **impact** of the exhibition and its potential to enable viewers to see Holocaust and contemporary images more critically **\[5.6\]**. This has helped inform the museum’s broader approach to digital learning: “ *Given the critical and sensitive nature of our content, robust and insightful evaluative work of the nature of online engagement and impact is particularly **important**. We see the work \[…\] as critical in informing next steps for the work of the Centre, and the broader field*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 The research also led to a <ins> **re\-design of the permanent Holocaust and Second World War Galleries at  IWM London**</ins>, projected to attract **over a million visitors a year**. As its Chief Curator states: Umbach’s “ *research about the contextualisation of photography as a physical entity, and your thoughts on what photographs from this period can tell us about the Nazis’ attempts to redevelop the landscape of eastern Europe in the image of the Reich were critical in the way that we developed our own approach*” **\[5.7\].** Umbach also supervises Tofts, a PhD student on a CPD with the IWM, to help the Museum’s Education Department to use private photos of Jewish victims of Nazim in their Holocaust education programme **\[5.7\].** The IWM’s Holocaust Education Director states that “ *in developing our approach, your research on photographs in the National Socialist era helped **shape our thinking** about how we might encourage young people to consider critically the purpose and meaning of photographs, particularly those taken by perpetrators, and the **power dynamic** inherent in all photography. Your creative suggestions about how IWM’s new Holocaust learning programme might work with a combination of digital technology, photography and personal testimony have been **inspirational** in helping IWM consider how students can engage with photographs directly rather than ‘seeing/not seeing’ them as mere wallpaper or less important than other historical evidence*” **\[5.7\]**. 

 Umbach’s research has since <ins> **influenced curatorial practice at**</ins> <ins> **the</ins> <ins> **Volkskundemuseum</ins><ins>**</ins> <ins>in Vienna, Austria**</ins>. The Curator, partner on Umbach’s AHRC project, was inspired by this research to create the **first ever** archive of private photos from the Nazi era in Austria, which continues its work of collecting and interpreting these items **\[5.8\]**. This new archive also formed the basis of the exhibition ‘Alles Antreten: Es wird geknipst\!” of private photos of Austrians under Nazi rule in Vienna in 2019 **\[E8**\] **.** Umbach’s research informed the exhibition design, and directly inspired the art installation commissioned for it. Finally, as the Curator states, “ *witnessing the evolution of ‘The Eye as Witness’ \[…\] persuaded me of the benefits of co\-developing History and Computer Science research \[…\] opening up new possibilities for how virtual and augmented reality can be mobilised to **destabilise** the way in which museum visitors view photography from this difficult period \[… and\] empower audience to critique photographs, and thus help develop **new** media literacies*” **\[5.8\].** 

 Umbach’s research also <ins> **transformed the practice of creative artists internationally**</ins>. An award\-winning **Swedish artist Linda Selander,** who created multi\-media installations presented across Europe, states that Umbach’s research *“has had a **crucial** impact on my work \[…\] opening up of new ways of seeing, new way of grounding the past in the present.”* Prior to engaging with this research, *“I had **no tools** to seriously question and move beyond such images, and my own work on the subject would simply not have been possible.’* **\[5.2\].** Similarly, a **London based artist Sarah Dobai**, who is working on an art film about Hungarian Holocaust victims, states that: *“Your research in this field very much supported my **approach** to the production of images,”* and is precisely why she avoided the use of ‘documentary’ photographs in the film, ‘The Donkey Field’. **\[5.3\].** The director of award\-winning New York based **Tectonic Theatre Company**, describes Umbach’s influence on their original production, ‘Here There Are Blueberries’. Umbach’s research *“became a **lynchpin** for our theatrical exploration of the images made by the perpetrators at Auschwitz.”* Her insights into the *“sociopolitical nature”* of *“ordinary”* photographs *“helped to clarify a critical theme in our play”* and enabled the writing of an additional scene “ *in which we explore \[…\] how the German people ‘performed’ and ‘humanized’ their daily lives for the camera*.” **\[5.4\]** The Director also comments on Umbach’s role in the development of an international educational programme around the play. Umbach’s research is thus reshaping new cultural outputs across a variety of media on an international scale. 

 In 2020, Umbach’s projects were selected as a UKRI impact case study on **EDI and Anti\-Racism \[5.9\]**, and, in the AHRC ‘Culture in Quarantine’ competition, to become the BBC film ""Through Whose Eyes? Photography of National Socialism and the Holocaust"". Umbach worked directly with the animator to design moving images around photos from her research to help audiences appreciate the difference between perpetrator and victim images. The film is now available on BBC iplayer  \(<ins>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08z2xxt</ins>\).As of 12 December 2020, it has been viewed over 5,000 times. **\[5.11\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Against a backdrop of serious decline in the teaching of Asian religions in England and Wales, Black’s and Ram\-Prasad’s research has reinvigorated and enriched the understanding of Hinduism and Buddhism amongst teachers and students of Religious Education \(RE\). Black and Ram\-Prasad have shared their research through annual teachers’ conferences, regular school visits, and extensive capacity\-building resources. These activities led to enhanced understandings and updated teaching practices, and were linked to improved student exam performance. In some cases, teaching programmes were saved. The research has also inspired teachers and students to challenge gender stereotyping about Asian religions and has supported a shift towards a more pluralistic and inclusive approach to RE, one more appropriate to today’s multi\-ethnic and multi\-faith society. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research by Black and Ram\-Prasad has brought attention to the importance of the dialogue form in the scriptures of Hinduism and Buddhism. In the process, it has demonstrated that key source texts are often more polyvocal and inclusive in relation to gender and class than has generally been assumed. The research has shown that the dialogue form invites ways of reading South Asian religious texts that are more open\-ended than scholars and school syllabi have recognised. Black and Ram\-Prasad have shown that, rather than approaching scripture as didactic commandments, Hindu and Buddhist texts use dialogue to convey the subtlety and complexity of key doctrines. 

 In 2015, Black conceived and co\-edited the first collection of academic essays to explore the uses and implications of the dialogue form across Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts \[R1\].  Both Hinduism and Buddhism have been criticised in the West for their attitudes towards gender and class. Black demonstrated however, that dialogue conveys views of gender and class that are more complex and nuanced than had widely been assumed.  His chapter, which compared dialogues from 3 classical sources \(2 Hindu and 1 Buddhist\), showed that the form explicitly addresses issues of gender and class in ways that complicate and challenge how these identities are represented in more didactic scriptures, and that the purported views of women and members of lower classes are often represented more positively than previously recognised \[R1, R2\]. 

 In 2016, Black and Ram\-Prasad secured funding to build upon this initial research \[G1\]. This resulted in an edited volume that further explored dialogue across Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain texts \[R3\]. Black’s chapter \[R4\] compared Hindu and Buddhist dialogues to show how the form addresses religious plurality and conveys different yet overlapping understandings of *dharma* \(moral order\); Ram\-Prasad’s chapter \[R5\] shows the complex portrayal of Hindu theology conveyed through dialogue, while also drawing attention to subaltern contributions to Hindu conceptions of the divine. 

 This was followed by Black’s 2020 monograph \[G1, R6\], the first extensive investigation into the uses and implications of dialogue in the Hindu epic, the *Mahābhārata.* Black shows that the *Mahābhārata*’s use of dialogue is integral to how it represents the central religious ideas and practices of Hinduism. He brings out 3 dimensions of dialogue in particular: the way it contains embedded methods of philosophical reasoning, the way it represents different perspectives, and the way it provokes readers to reflect further on the main teachings of the text. 

 Owing to research by Black and Ram\-Prasad, there is now an improved understanding of the uses and implications of dialogue in primary Asian religious sources. Their research is particularly relevant to RE, because the changes to the GCSE and A level specifications in 2016 require teachers and students to engage more closely with primary sources. Moreover, their work is a reference point for contemporary comparative philosophical debates and has relevance to an increasingly multicultural society.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In an increasingly multicultural Britain, Asian religions have a growing presence. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, followers of Hinduism rose by 276,584 \(49% increase\) and numbers following Buddhism rose by 109,768 \(72% increase\). Despite these demographic changes, RE provision at GCSE and A level has become more focused on Abrahamic religions. This is largely a consequence of exam boards’ responses to the Department for Education’s \(DfE’s\) demand for greater emphasis on primary texts. Data supplied by the OCR and AQA Exam Boards suggest that there are approximately 54,600 GCSE entries each year in England with Buddhism or Hinduism options, while approximately 2,250 A level entries feature one of these options. At all levels, the DfE has demanded much greater emphasis on the use of primary texts. However, RE teachers struggle to meet this demand for a combination of reasons. Many RE teachers are non\-specialists with limited subject knowledge; a GCSE textbook, endorsed by Edquas, did not become available until spring 2020; and while there is an AS level textbook, there are no dedicated resources for final year A level students. Consequently, fewer teachers have felt confident in their subject knowledge of Asian traditions, positioning Hinduism and Buddhism as increasingly neglected topics within religious education. This predicament facing the teaching of Asian religions in schools first became apparent to Black in 2014 while carrying out student recruitment campaigns on behalf of Lancaster University. 

 **Reversing the decline in the study of Asian religions in schools** 

 Research by Black and Ram\-Prasad has supported the continued teaching of Asian religions against a backdrop of inadequate teacher knowledge and a critical lack of resources. Since 2014, Black has worked closely with teachers to design a series of resources and activities that draw on his and Ram\-Prasad’s research findings \[R1\-6\]. These include illustrated PowerPoint presentations, videos, and interactive worksheets. Resources have been shared primarily through teachers’ conferences and school visits and have also been widely distributed via Black’s 250\-strong network of RE teachers, social media groups, the National Association for Teachers of Religious Education \(NATRE\) and the Online Resource Centre for Religious Education \(ORCRE\). Additionally, in the spring of 2020, Black created a series of 35 podcasts which became a vital resource for online teaching during the COVID\-19 lockdown. These resources had been viewed 2,129 times by December 2020 \[S9\]. Between 2014 and 2019, the teachers’ conferences had been attended by 353 different teachers and Black had visited over 25 schools. Black is recognised in the religious education community as an expert point of reference for teachers, educational bodies, and exam boards who need support with Hinduism or Buddhism to meet syllabus specifications \[S1\-S7\]. Feedback from the 2019 teachers’ conference showed that 92% of delegates teaching Buddhism, and 82% of those teaching Hinduism, planned to adopt these new teaching resources and methods \[S8\]. 

 Through this series of activities and resources, Black and Ram\-Prasad have been able to reverse the decline of the teaching of Asian religions in a number of ways. They have reinvigorated teachers \[S1\-7\] and helped to bring ‘a new confidence’ to the teaching of Asian religions \[S6\]. The Chair of NATRE has indicated that the activities and resources have contributed to the preservation of Asian religion programmes in some schools, while in others they have inspired teachers to include Asian religions for the first time: “ *I feel sure \[Black’s input\] contributed towards teachers continuing to teach Asian religions, or making the leap to teaching them for the first time. Without this input, fewer teachers would have wanted to offer these subjects*” \[S7\]. One teacher confirmed that the support offered by Black was instrumental in encouraging her school to begin teaching Buddhism \[S1\]. In another example, a teacher credited Black’s resources with saving the teaching of Hinduism at his school: “ *Without the resources, no teacher is going to want to work on the options for Asian religions. The research and preparation time involved places a totally unrealistic load on teachers and our school would definitely have stopped teaching Hinduism without Brian’s contribution”* \[S3\]. 

 **Improving literacy and building capacity amongst teachers of Asian religions** 

 Additionally, Black’s and Ram\-Prasad’s research has improved teachers’ literacy about Asian religions. Their research has become increasingly applicable to teachers who have had to engage more deeply with primary texts to meet new exam board specifications \[S8\]. As the Chair of NATRE has confirmed, resources for teaching Asian religions are especially important because these traditions demand “deep subject knowledge and the availability of contemporary research” \[S7\]. Their research is particularly relevant because it relates to texts that are included in the specifications \[R1\-6\] and because it explores how, within these texts, the dialogue form plays an integral role in articulating and characterising key concepts on the specifications, such as *dharma*, *karma*, *yoga, bhakti*, and *varna* \[R2, R4\-6\] *.* Black’s and Ram\-Prasad’s activities and resources contribute to improving literacy by bringing attention to the dialogical form and structure of Hindu and Buddhist sources and by showing how central doctrines in the texts are articulated in ways that are far more subtle and multi\-faceted than are widely recognised. Better understanding of the primary sources and of how they represent their main doctrines are of direct relevance to teachers’ capacity to teach optimally in the classroom: “ *Deeper knowledge and understanding has given me a much greater appreciation of the texts and their value in teaching, especially the value of using story/narrative*” \[S8\]. 

 Teachers highlighted that the step up from teaching GCSE to A level under the new regulations is very large, one that they felt ill\-equipped to make: “ *Prior to my involvement with the conferences, I had only taught Hinduism at GCSE level and they were an invaluable and transformative opportunity to update my subject knowledge”* \[S4\]. Feedback from all participants at the 2019 teachers’ conference demonstrated that the research findings made an extremely constructive and positive contribution to their teaching, aligning teacher’s knowledge and capacity with exam board expectations \[S8\]. The Head of the AQA Exam Board for RE stated: *“\[Black\] has the ability to distil high level academic expertise in a way that secondary school teachers can take forward in the classroom*” \[S6\]. As one teacher testified: *“Teaching via the texts was not something I had considered, and the conference has really helped me gain an insight in to how I can adapt my teaching for the benefit of my students”* \[S8\]. 

 **Improving educational outcomes for students of Asian religions** 

 Black’s school visits have also contributed to improved understandings among students. Through 10 annual school visits, Black reaches approximately 500 AS/A level students each year. Considering that approximately 2,250 students take exams in Buddhism and Hinduism every year, Black’s visits reach a high percentage of students studying these religions in England and Wales. In 2017\-2018, 77% of 253 students stated their understanding of Hinduism had changed and 98% stated they had learned something new \[S10\]. “ *\[Black\] was able to identify and bring to life the underlying concepts in a way that the students could grasp and understand…He showed how a single story has multiple dimensions and perspectives and can be used to illustrate many different points of view. The dialogues helped to anchor learning and the lessons become a lot more memorable”* \[S3\]. Moreover, interaction with the research has changed behaviour on the part of students, igniting a new interest in the subject: “ *To work with a real\-life Hindu\[ism\] scholar was a much more stimulating and enriching experience for them than referring to a textbook”* \[S5\]. After school visits in 2017\-2018, 58% of students reported that they were likely to continue with the study of Asian religions after school, either formally or informally, with many making reference to the way the research had ignited a passion for the subject \[S10\]. Teachers spoke of the inspirational impact of Black’s school visits, which had directly influenced some students’ subsequent higher education and career choices \[S1, S5\]. 

 Furthermore, feedback from teachers pointed to an improvement in exam grades. An AQA A level examiner explained: “ *Students who have used Brian’s resources can handle the exam specifications in more depth and support their arguments with a wider range of examples. Their understanding is definitely deeper and they demonstrate higher levels of ability in analysis and evaluation*” \[S1\]. Another teacher confirmed an improvement in exam grades: “ *Our A level students have consistently achieved their best results on the Hinduism paper in recent years, which represents a third of their overall A level mark. I attribute this to the fact that I am now very confident about what I am teaching, which I can relate back to the encouragement and subject expertise that I have acquired at Brian’s conferences and through our ongoing contact*” \[S4\]. 

 **Redressing assumptions around gender stereotypes in Asian religious texts** 

 Sociological aspects of Hinduism and Buddhism, including gender and class, are heavily emphasised in GCSE and A level specifications. Unfortunately, the representation of Hindu and Buddhist views on gender and class in the most widely available textbooks and resources often perpetuate unwarranted prejudices and reinforce Western attitudes of superiority. According to INSIGHT UK’S *A report on the state of Hinduism in Religious Education in UK schools* \(2021\), 75% of Hindus felt that Hinduism is not taught in a positive light. In particular, respondents were dissatisfied with teaching on gender and the caste system. Research by Black and Ram\-Prasad demonstrates that Hindu and Buddhist conceptualisations of gender and class \(including caste\) are far more complex and nuanced than has widely been assumed \[R1\-6\]. Engagement with their research has disrupted prejudices and changed understanding among teachers and students alike. One teacher who is also an AQA examiner commented: “ *There is a particular focus in the syllabus specifications on the role of women in Buddhism, but standard recommended texts based on the Theravada can be very negative in their interpretation. Through working with Brian, I have had access to texts written by female monastics and modern female scholars with a much more positive angle which has changed my own perspective and the way I teach*” \[S1\]. The usefulness of Black’s contribution to re\-examining representations of gender is strongly referenced in teacher feedback. One sixth of the current A level paper examines equality and discrimination and as a teacher noted "" *It could easily become a social issues unit, but it must be rooted in the faith. Here \[Black’s\] research on the Mahabharata has been invaluable to illustrate some of the feminist principles it embodies*” \[S2\]. Students also stated that their understanding of the gender dimension had been enriched: “ *I realised that there are a lot more debates and contradiction towards the status of women throughout scriptures*” \[S10\]. Black’s contribution to advancing the understanding of gender aspects within the texts is supported by the topic being the most popular choice in his series of online resources \[S9\]. 

 **Promoting more inclusivity and worldviews in religious education** 

 As demonstrated by the Commission on RE’s \(CoRE\) recommendations in 2018, there is a movement within Religious Education to include the worldviews of practitioners, rather than focus exclusively on the institutional versions of religious doctrine. Black’s and Ram\-Prasad’s research is particularly relevant to this educational development, as their exploration of dialogue brings attention to the multiple views represented within sacred literature \[R1\-6\], as well as to the diverse ways religious teachings have been interpreted and understood by practitioners \[R4, R5\]. As one teacher explained: “ *Through his work in schools, \[Black\] has also supported the shift towards ‘worldviews’, demonstrating the fluidity of Hinduism and how belief as illustrated in the scriptures can differ widely from actual practice*” \[S5\]. Students from Asian religious communities have greatly benefitted from their engagement with the research because it encourages them to interpret the sources of their religion within the context of their own lives, enabling them to link their faith back to their own lived experiences. The Chair of NATRE confirmed: “ *This can be a very mind\-opening and valuable experience”*’ \[S7\]. 

 Although teachers recognise that “to learn effectively, young people need to be able to recognise themselves and that the experiences they are bringing to classes have intrinsic value”, teachers are also increasingly aware that students from “non\-Abrahamic religious communities struggle to relate to or reconcile their own lived experience to what they are being taught in schools” \[S7\]. Moreover, INSIGHT UK’S report \(2021\) stated that many Hindu parents are concerned that the negative portrayal of Hinduism in the classroom results in an insensitivity towards Hindus. In this context, the resources provided by Black and Ram\-Prasad have provided an opportunity for students from Asian communities to see their tradition represented in a positive and meaningful way that is relevant to their own lives, as well as to the lives of others. As one teacher explained: “For students who belong to Hindu or Buddhist faith communities, the teaching of Asian religions in UK schools is a very empowering experience as it demonstrates an appreciation and understanding of their faiths, which validates their place in British national life *”* \[S5\]. At a time when an understanding of Asian religions has become more vital than ever, Black and Ram\-Prasad’s activities and resources have made a major contribution to this goal by reinvigorating and enriching how these traditions have been taught in schools.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr **Irwin\-Rogers’** research on youth violence, particularly for the cross\-party Youth Violence Commission \(YVC\), has played a pivotal role in driving major changes to public, private and third sector policies and practices on youth violence. **Irwin\-Rogers’** work for the YVC led to the establishment of regional Violence Reduction Units in England and Wales and has been central in shaping the on\-going work of these units. In addition, acting on **Irwin\-Rogers’** recommendations, Google and the London Violence Reduction Unit have provided grants totalling GBP800,000 to fund *The Social Switch Project,* the primary aim of which is to reduce violence in young people’s lives. This innovative project has delivered safeguarding workshops to over 500 practitioners and provided work experience and skills training in the digital sector to over 40 young people. **Irwin\-Rogers’** research has also had a significant and direct influence on the funding priorities and work of the on\-going GBP200million Youth Endowment Fund. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since taking up his post with The Open University in January 2017, **Irwin\-Rogers** has conducted research into youth violence reduction primarily in England and Wales, focusing in particular on the potential benefits and feasibility of a public health approach. A key strand of **Irwin\-Rogers’** work has been his role as the lead academic for the cross\-party Youth Violence Commission \(YVC\), conducting research alongside economists from the University of Warwick’s Policy Lab. The YVC was established by a cross\-party group of MPs to identify and promote evidence\-based policies aimed at reversing the rising trend in knife crime and serious violence between young people. **Irwin\-Rogers’** research for the YVC has consisted of three main strands: 

1.  <ins>Interviews and Observations with the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit</ins> 

 The Scottish Violence Reduction Unit \(SVRU\) is widely acclaimed for its work in reducing levels of serious violence in major cities such as Glasgow. Between 2017\-18, **Irwin\-Rogers** conducted interviews and observations with senior members of the SVRU, including its Co\-Director and its Co\-Deputy Director. The research indicated that one of the key factors in reducing violence in Glasgow had been a move away from narrow, suppression and enforcement\-based strategies and their replacement with public health approaches, which involve identifying and adopting evidence\-based policies and practices across a wide range of social policy areas including health, education and youth services, driven and coordinated by teams of professionals such as the SVRU **\[O2, O3\]**. 

1.  <ins>National ‘Safer Lives’ Survey on Youth Violence</ins> 

 To address a lack of evidence on the levels of serious violence in young people’s lives, the YVC implemented a national youth survey in January 2018. Designed by **Irwin\-Rogers**, the *Safer Lives* survey gathered evidence on the nature and scope of violence affecting a diverse sample of over 2,000 young people in England and Scotland **\[O2, O3, O6\]**. The data revealed the high rate of violence in the lives of young people below the age of 16, and found that two thirds of respondents had been exposed to serious violence over social media, a finding that both confirmed the significance of social media that **Irwin\-Rogers** had highlighted in previous research **\[O4\]** and informed subsequent YVC recommendations and consequent policy and practice\-based initiatives such as *The* *Social Switch Project* **\[O2, O5\]**. 

1.  <ins>Expert Evidence Sessions</ins> 

 Between October 2017 and May 2018, **Irwin\-Rogers** played a central role in designing, organizing, and conducting six expert evidence sessions on the Parliamentary Estate. **Irwin\-Rogers** sat on panels taking evidence at four of the six sessions, each of which focused on a topic associated with the public health approach to violence reduction. Data was gathered from senior professionals and experts including the Head of the National Crime Agency, a Metropolitan Police Management Board representative, and the editor\-at\-large for The Guardian newspaper. Discussions from each evidence session were fully transcribed and analysed by **Irwin\-Rogers** and used to inform subsequent academic publications **\[O1, O5, O6\]**, as well as the YVC’s interim and final reports **\[O2, O3\]**. The evidence sessions further exposed the limitations of narrow policing\-based approaches to reducing youth violence and highlighted, for example, the importance of nurturing inclusive school environments under the broad scope of holistic public health approaches to violence reduction, overseen and coordinated by regional Violence Reduction Units. 

 <ins>Taking the research forward</ins> 

 **Irwin\-Rogers’** research for the YVC fed into an Open Grant application to the ESRC to build on and enhance some of the YVC’s research, engagement and impact activities. The application was successful, and **Irwin\-Rogers** is now part of a team of researchers \(led by Dr. Alistair Fraser, University of Glasgow\) who have secured GBP870,954.39 for a three\-year project on youth violence reduction which began in December 2020 **\[G1\]**. **Irwin\-Rogers** is leading on the London\-based component of this research, examining policy transfer between jurisdictions and informing the development of effective violence reduction strategies, policies and practices.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Irwin\-Rogers** has supported the Youth Violence Commission as lead academic, playing a central role in each component of its research, outputs, and impact and engagement activities **\[C1\]**. YVC research and reports have played a pivotal role in shaping public, private and third sector policy and practice through numerous channels. 

 <ins>Impact at a National Level</ins> 

 Through a series of meetings with key Government Ministers and other senior officials and debates and questions in the House of Commons, and the YVC has played a central role in shaping national Government policy on reducing violence between young people. 

 On 4<sup>th</sup> May 2018, **Irwin\-Rogers** met with the Prime Minister’s Special Advisor on Home Affairs and Justice at Number 10 Downing Street to discuss the YVC’s interim findings and recommendations **\[C2\]**. Among other things, **Irwin\-Rogers** made the case for tackling high rates of school exclusion and adopting a holistic public health approach to reducing youth violence, overseen and coordinated by regional Violence Reduction Units. In the House of Commons on 16<sup>th</sup> July 2018, the Home Secretary responded to a question from the Chair of the YVC, stating that he would make “ *a commitment to work with the all\-party Parliamentary group*” **\[C3\]**. Within three months, the Home Secretary announced ‘ *new measures’* to build on the Government’s Serious Violence Strategy, pledging his support for a public health approach to tackling youth violence **\[C4\]**. 

 Subsequently, the Chair of the YVC and **Irwin\-Rogers** met with senior government officials including the Minister for London and Policing \(18<sup>th</sup> March 2019\), the Prime Minister \(28<sup>th</sup> March 2019\), the Home Office Minister \(10<sup>th</sup> January 2019\), and the Minister for Schools \(10<sup>th</sup> July 2019\) to obtain high\-level commitment to implementing the YVC’s recommendations **\[C1\]**. In June 2019 the Home Secretary announced GBP35,000,000 funding for the establishment of 18 regional Violence Reduction Units **\[C5\]**. 

 MPs and Lords have formally recognised the work of the YVC and **Irwin\-Rogers’** research 72 times in the two Houses of Parliament **\[C6\]**. 

 <ins>Impact at a Regional Level</ins> 

 The YVC negotiated an exclusive campaign with the London Evening Standard to promote the recommendations of its interim report. Describing the publication as a ‘ *landmark report’*, the paper ran a front\-page article on 18<sup>th</sup> July 2018 aimed at persuading the London Mayor to adopt a holistic public health approach to reducing serious youth violence **\[C7\]**. In the same article, the Chair of the YVC called on the Mayor of London to create a London VRU to oversee the proposed public health approach. In response, the Mayor of London arranged a meeting with the Chair of the YVC on 30<sup>th</sup> August 2018 **\[C8a\]**, before releasing a press release on 19<sup>th</sup> September 2018 announcing his plans to develop and implement an “ *innovative public health approach to tackling violent crime*” **\[C8b\]**. In September 2020, in his 44<sup>th</sup> Report to the London Assembly, the Mayor of London welcomed the “ *many compelling recommendations”* of the YVC final report, and acknowledged that along with the then Home Secretary, he had endorsed and acted on the YVC’s recommended public health approach by establishing the London VRU **\[C9\]**. The YVC has worked closely with the London VRU since its inception and shaped its ongoing work and priorities. The Director of the London VRU said “ *the evidence of the report galvanised the policy agenda around the key wider issues from the role of schools to the importance of the health sector in playing its part. One of the key policies asked from the report was the establishment and long term support for violence reduction units across England and Wales; the Commission was a powerful advocate and used the parliamentary process to argue strongly and successfully*” **\[C10\]**. 

 <ins>Impact on private and third sector policies and practices</ins> 

 Following the publication of a research report on social media and serious violence **\[O4\]**, **Irwin\-Rogers** has participated in numerous private meetings with Facebook \(online\) and Google/YouTube \(London Headquarters\) during the period 2018\-2020 **\[C11\]**. During these meetings, **Irwin\-Rogers** advised on the development and refinement of the platforms’ monitoring and safeguarding policies. **Irwin\-Rogers** also recommended that Google/YouTube should take the lead in establishing social media safeguarding training for professionals working with young people. 

 In December 2018, based on these meetings and **Irwin\-Rogers’** research, Google announced a grant of GBP600,000 to fund the *Social Switch Project* **\[C11\]**. **Irwin\-Rogers** was invited to act as an Advisory Board member for the project and in this capacity has continued to inform its content and delivery **\[C11\]**. The project has three main strands: a series of social media training workshops for frontline professionals working with young people; a programme of work experience in the digital sector for disadvantaged young people; and direct funding to grassroots organisations working with young people. Interim evaluations have shown that the project has delivered highly\-rated social media safeguarding workshops to over 500 practitioners and provided digital skills training and work experience to over 40 young people **\[C12\]**. Among some of the most encouraging findings from an interim evaluation of the project, three young people have subsequently gained employment, two have secured apprenticeships, two have completed internships, seven have completed work experience placements, and another seven have set up their own social media platforms. As a consequence of its positive impact, the London Violence Reduction Unit has allocated an additional GBP200,000 to further support and extend the work of the *Social Switch Project* **\[C11\]**. 

 In October 2018, the then Home Secretary, announced the creation of a new ten\-year, GBP200,000,000 initiative known as the Youth Endowment Fund \(YEF\), the purpose of which is build up an evidence base for effective early interventions, and to fund programmes to steer young people away from crime and violence. The YVC has exerted a significant influence over the YEF’s work since its inception, with the YEF’s Executive Director acknowledging three specific forms of YVC influence and support: i\) the building up of a strong coalition of delivery organisations and politicians with whom the YEF will engage throughout its life cycle; ii\) the identification of key priority areas such as schooling, which will now receive GBP5\-GBP10million of YEF funding; and iii\) the development of a research and practice model that will “ *impact the spend of our entire GBP200m endowment*”. The YEF Executive Director acknowledged the wider impact of the YVC with “ *thanks and acknowledgement of the work that has been done, the direct impact it has on wider society, the youth violence sector, government and the lives of young people”* **\[C13\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 DvZS and CA’s research has impacted significantly the imposition and implementation of life imprisonment worldwide. DvZS’s research established a principle of international human rights law, that life prisoners have a ‘right to hope’ for release. It underpinned a key judgment of the European Court of Human Rights outlawing life sentences without a reasonable prospect of release. This principle has led directly to demonstrable changes in law and practice globally that ensure life prisoners are considered for release. DvZS and CA’s joint research further extended the importance of the right to be considered for release by critically assessing for the first time the practice of life imprisonment worldwide. Their research not only changed the law in Namibia, outlawing very long fixed\-term sentences, but put the issue of life imprisonment firmly on the international penal policy reform agenda. On the basis of this research, the NGO Penal Reform International \(PRI\) developed a new objective to reform the practice of life imprisonment globally. Together with PRI, CA and DvZS have succeeded in placing the issue of life imprisonment on the United Nation’s criminal justice and human rights agendas, thus impacting life imprisonment reform worldwide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Between 2001 and 2014, DvZS’s comparative research \(R1\-R4\) highlighted a significant shift in Europe away from the imposition of irreducible life sentences \(whole life imprisonment\) towards life sentences with a realistic prospect of release. DvZS’s 2002 book *Taking Life Imprisonment Seriously in National and International Law* \(R1\) was the first major comparative study of life imprisonment ever attempted. It focused on life imprisonment in the USA, England and Wales and Germany, as well as at the international level and began to address the policies that would be required to reshape life imprisonment in a way that would make it compatible with human rights principles. These arguments were developed further in 2006, in an updating article \(R2\) that emphasised it was essential that life prisoners have a prospect of release. 

 In 2010, DvZS addressed the European debate directly \(R3\). His research reflected on the growing recognition of a human right that life prisoners have to a process that gives them hope of release. It also developed arguments about how such a right should be implemented in practice. DvZS called on the European Court of Human Rights \(ECtHR\) to clarify its thinking, both in law and in fact, on what life imprisonment with the prospect of release would mean in practice. As a member of the legal team for an applicant to the ECtHR, Douglas Vinter, DvZS was able subsequently to apply his research in litigation. The global impact of the resultant judgment of the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in *Vinter and Others v. UK*, 9 July 2013 during the review period, is highlighted below. In 2014 DvZS, together with his fellow trial advocates, carefully analysed the *Vinter* decision and pointed out its implications for future practice relating to the release of life prisoners in the research article R4. 

 Between 2014 and 2017, DvZS and CA carried out further research funded by the Leverhulme Trust on ‘Life Imprisonment Worldwide’ \(R5, R6\). This work expanded their earlier work on the importance of the right to be considered for release and critically assessed the practice of life imprisonment, for the first time on a fully global scale. Its main aims were to describe life imprisonment worldwide, to evaluate the imposition and implementation of life imprisonment and to provide guidance to policymakers and practitioners on the imposition of life imprisonment in a human\-rights compliant way. 

 DvZS and CA’s first co\-edited book from the project \(R5\) brought together scholars and practitioners to highlight the problematic use of life imprisonment across jurisdictions. Their final co\-authored book– *Life Imprisonment: A Global Human Rights Analysis* \(R6\) – showed that in 2014, life imprisonment was the ultimate penalty in far more countries than the death penalty \(127 compared to 57\). 33 countries had no formal provision for life sentences, but 65 \(almost twice as many\) imposed life imprisonment without the possibility of parole sentences, the harshest form of life imprisonment. The research also found that, at the end of 2014, an estimated 479,000 people were serving formal sentences of life imprisonment, many of whom had little or no prospect of release. Analysis of the findings made it clear that life imprisonment is a severe sanction that is often imposed excessively, implemented too harshly and can lead to significant breaches of the fundamental human rights of those subject to it.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 DvZS and CA’s pioneering body of work on life imprisonment has impacted both law and practice in two inter\-related and significant ways. First, their research has changed the law on life imprisonment by ensuring a prospect of release for life\-sentenced prisoners across several jurisdictions. Secondly, they have influenced international prison reform institutions in their approach to dealing with the issue of life imprisonment. 

 **Ensuring a prospect of release for life\-sentenced prisoners** 

 DvZS’s extensive research \(R1\-R3\) shaped the ECtHR’s seminal judgment on life imprisonment \( *Vinter* *and Others v. UK*, ECtHR GC 9 July 2013\). The QC, leading the team for the applicant, has commented that as a member of the applicant’s legal team, DvZS used his research \(R1\-R3\) and “encyclopaedic knowledge” \(A\) to develop arguments that persuaded the Court to apply the ‘right to hope’ principle to life imprisonment. R3 was directly cited at first instance \( *Vinter v. UK*, 17 January 2012, para. 55\), and its arguments followed by the ECtHR Grand Chamber in 2013. The QC commented: “ *The Grand Chamber judgment adopted much of the Applicants’ argument, determining that imprisonment for whole life, without a real and effective means of eventual conditional release, was an affront to human dignity which underpins the Convention rights. Whole life imprisonment without an effective mechanism for release was inhuman and degrading, in violation of Article 3. … Based on his \[DvZS’s\] research, his constructive criticism and development of our extensive written submissions was invaluable, and his input into the oral submissions assisted in identifying the points that might be exercising the seventeen\-judge panel from across the Council of Europe countries. This last point is of great importance. Oral submissions to the Grand Chamber are strictly time\-limited and there is no time to develop the full legal argument. Professor van Zyl Smit’s research brought to the team a nuanced knowledge of relevant issues, which would be of particular note to judges from different jurisdictions, allowing focus on those points.”* \(A\) 

 The *Vinter* judgment has been more influential than any other in establishing as a worldwide human rights principle, that all prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment must have a realistic prospect of release from prison and that appropriate procedures should be put in place to give effect to the hope of release. Although the *Vinter* decision was given in July 2013, the establishment of the ‘right to hope’ as propagated in the research of DvZS \(R1\-R4\) through the *Vinter* judgment, has changed the law and practice of life imprisonment across the world since \(A\), and it is these changes since August 2013 that we are claiming in this impact case study. In the first instance, the effects were felt in Europe where all countries are bound to apply the European Convention on Human Rights as interpreted by the ECtHR: 

-  In the *United Kingdom*, the principles developed in *Vinter* were clearly accepted as binding in England and Wales by the Court of Appeal in *McLoughlin* \(2014\). However, the Court of Appeal found that no change to domestic statutory law was required as it could be applied in a way that incorporated these principles. This view was upheld by the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in *Hutchinson v. UK* \(2017\), which left the *Vinter* principles in place by confirming \(at para 72, B\) that, *“the whole life sentence can now be regarded as reducible \[in England and Wales\] in keeping with Article 3 of the ECHR \[European Convention on Human Rights\]”*, but that they could be implemented without changing English statutes. The practical impact of *Vinter* in England and Wales is therefore that the existing law relating to prisoners serving whole life sentences now has to be interpreted in a way that is more favourable to their possible release \(A, B\). 

-  In the *Netherlands*, the Supreme Court relied on the reasoning developed in the *Vinter* decision, based on R1\-R3, to order the government to change the law to provide an effective procedure for the release of life\-sentenced prisoners \(Decision of the *Hoge Raad*, 5 July 2016, para. 3.2\) \(C\). Prior to this, there was no effective procedure for the release of life prisoners, except for a pardon, which in practice was never granted. In response, in 2017, the rules governing release in the Netherlands were amended to establish a process of release of such prisoners \( *Besluit Adviescollege levenslanggestraften Stcrt*. 2017, 32577\) \(C\). These were reviewed by the Supreme Court, which found explicitly that they met the Vinter standards \(Decision of the *Hoge Raad*, 2017, para. 2.3\) \(C\). The result is that all life prisoners in the Netherlands now have their cases reviewed after a set period and their prospects of release have increased. 

-  *Lithuania*, is an example of where the absence of an appropriate release procedure was challenged before the ECtHR and changes resulted from the ECtHR applying the *Vinter* principles \(based on R1\-R3\) and ordered Lithuania to amend its legislation \( *Matiošaitis v. Lithuania,* 23 May 2017\) \(D\). Lithuania enacted new legislation on the release of life prisoners \(Amendment to Article 51 of the Criminal Code of Lithuania adopted on 19 March 2019\). The ECtHR has confirmed explicitly that it meets the *Vinter* standards \( *Dardanskis v. Lithuania*, \(2019, para.27\) \(D\), thus confirming that life prisoners will now be entitled to be considered for release after a prescribed period, by a fairer procedure than before. 

 The arguments about a ‘right to hope’ and a ‘right to be considered for release’, as developed in the *Vinter* case which was underpinned by R1\-R3 and propagated in R4, have had a reach and impact far beyond Europe, as courts around the world have found them persuasive: 

-  In *Zimbabwe*, the Supreme Court were persuaded by the reasoning in *Vinter* \(underpinned by R1\-R3\) to rule that it was unconstitutional to leave decisions on the release of life\-sentenced prisoners to the President alone \( *Makoni v. Commissioner of Prisons* \(2016\) \(E\). The Court also ordered that, until the government of Zimbabwe came up with new legislation, all life\-sentenced prisoners should be considered for parole in the same way as other sentenced prisoners, thus significantly increasing their prospects of release. 

-  In *Belize*, the Court of Appeal relied on the reasoning in *Vinter* \(based on R1\-R3\) to declare life sentences without parole unconstitutional \( *R v. August*, 4 November 2016\) \(F\). The government of Belize responded in 2017 by amending the sentencing provisions in the Criminal Code relating to murder and by introducing a parole board to consider the release of life\-sentenced prisoners. These changes were approved by the Caribbean Court of Justice, which also relied on the reasoning developed in *Vinter* \( *August and Gabb v. The Queen*, 2018, para. 88\) \(F\). The impact of *Vinter* was to bring about a legal change that has given all life\-sentenced prisoners in Belize a realistic prospect of release. 

-  In *Canada*, in *R v. Klaus* \(2018, paras. 132\-134\) \(G\) the Queen’s Bench in Alberta, referred to DvZS’s research \(R2, R3\), as well as to the arguments applied in the *Vinter* judgment, based on R1\-R3, to establish the principle that every prisoner must have a prospect of release. In this case, the prisoner had committed three murders. He received a life sentence with a minimum term of 25 years before release should be considered for each murder. The question was whether the minimum terms should run consecutively, meaning that 75 years would have to elapse before he could be considered for release. By applying the arguments in *Vinter*, that the prospect of release had to be realistic \(R1\-R3\), the court held that the minimum periods had to run concurrently, and that it should be 25 years in all. The direct impact of the *Vinter* principle was therefore that this life prisoner was given a much clearer prospect of release than he would otherwise have had. 

 In addition, in *Namibia*, the research of DvZS and CA \(R6\) has also ensured that all prisoners should have a prospect of release, albeit by a different legal route. Namibian law has long recognised that prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment have a right to a prospect of release. However, fixed term sentences of 100 years plus were being imposed by judges to ensure that certain offenders would never be considered for release, and the Namibian Supreme Court had to decide whether such sentences were acceptable. When asked for advice by the Court, DvZS and CA were able to provide a draft chapter of their co\-authored book \(R6\) that explained that such sentences were informal forms of life imprisonment and should be subject to the same safeguards as formal life sentences. In 2018 in *S.v. Gaingob* \(H\), the Supreme Court of Namibia referred to R6 as an “illuminating work” and discussed the research at length \(paras. 61ff\). The judgment relied directly on the arguments in R6 to outlaw very long fixed\-term sentences as a type of ‘informal life imprisonment’, and as an unconstitutional means of avoiding the requirements that life sentences should meet. The practical impact of this declaration of unconsitutionality has been that offenders in Namibia cannot have any have sentences imposed on them that effectively deny them a prospect of release. 

 **Influencing the international penal policy reform agenda** 

 DvZS and CA’s research project on ‘life imprisonment worldwide’ \(R5, R6\) has impacted the international penal policy reform agenda on the imposition and implementation of life sentences. The findings from R6 have shaped and advanced the work of PRI, an independent, international human rights NGO that develops and promotes fair and effective responses to criminal justice problems worldwide. This is corroborated by the Director for Policy and International Advocacy at PRI: *“PRI has used this key publication \(R6\) to advance its work on reforming life imprisonment…The research has enabled us to build a legitimate evidence base, strengthening our influence and increasing our visibility to an international policy and practitioner audience…\[It\] has provided the foundation on which we have built our reform and advocacy work..\[And\] has gone on to shape the priorities of our organisation more than any other academic publication during the last ten years…”* \(I\). 

 In 2018, PRI published a jointly authored policy briefing on ‘Life Imprisonment’ with DvZS and CA to draw attention to the human rights issues raised by the sanction of life imprisonment \(J\). The briefing \(published in Arabic, English, French, Japanese and Russian\), which draws on the research findings and statistics from R5 and R6, highlights key concerns to policymakers and practitioners who impose and implement life sentence regimes, and calls on the United Nations and its member states to reconsider and update international guidance on the sanction of life imprisonment. *“These pressure points work together to create momentum for change through reforms. The policy briefing was significant in raising international awareness with policymakers, civil society and academic networks”* \(I\). Collectively, this work resulted in PRI and the researchers taking leadership for a new world coalition involving an international network to tackle the issues raised by the research \(R5, R6\) and galvanised momentum for change \(J\). This has resulted in a targeted programme of events, and has led to an increased focus on the issue of life imprisonment at the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \(OHCHR\), and at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \(UNODC\) \(I\-K\). *“The collaboration including the research has created a major opportunity for PRI to help shape the thinking and actions of the United Nations OHCHR in Geneva and New York, and the UNODC in Vienna. Guided by the research, PRI organised a series of events including two key ‘side\-events’ at the UN Crime Commission in Vienna \(in 2018 and 2019\), where we engaged with national delegates representing their countries, diplomats, UN officials, civil society, etc. and gained momentum in highlighting the human rights issues raised by life imprisonment...”* \(I\) *.* 

 In September 2019, following the campaign and key meetings, the OHCHR agreed that life imprisonment was an issue that had been neglected at the international level, compared to their human rights work on the death penalty, and invited PRI and the researchers to run a workshop to present the research and recommendations \(R5, R6\) to 20 Human Rights Officers, including the Secretariat of the Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture and also high\-level staff members in the OHCHR. In addition, in October 2019, PRI was granted an extended meeting in New York with the then UN Assistant Secretary\-General for Human Rights to discuss life imprisonment, which led to him openly praising PRI and the research findings on social media, and a request for a joint event at the UN General Assembly. On 17 October 2019, in response to discussing the research findings with PRI, the UN Assistant Secretary General for Human Rights stated on Twitter: *“Death penalty rightly gets attention. But far more people serve life sentences. Many with no hope of parole and extra violence in prison. Understandably, some call it ‘civil death’. Hats off to PRI for flagging these largely unknown concerns”* \(J\). Furthermore, as a result of the advocacy by PRI and the researchers, the UNODC agreed to have two sessions at their Crime Commission meetings in Vienna in 2018 and 2019 that focussed specifically on life imprisonment and the need for global reform \(I\). This increased focus at the UN has led to the following significant impacts: 

-  Firstly, Austria \(who leads the annual resolution on the administration of justice at the Human Rights Council\) committed to supporting life imprisonment reform. This led to the issue of life imprisonment being added to the resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council in September 2019 \(K\). Specifically, it called for more proportionate sentencing, including a review of life sentences. “ *This is significant as it is an important reference at the UN level and will form one of hopefully many recognitions that life imprisonment sentences are problematic, have a human rights impact and that action needs to be taken… it forms a basis for advocacy around standard\-setting on life imprisonment at the UN level which can result in new international law and ultimately accountability.”* \(I\) 

-  Secondly, the UNODC has agreed to work with the researchers to produce a ‘Handbook on Life Imprisonment’, based on the findings from R5 and R6 and to include technical guidance on the practice of life imprisonment for prison operation, staff and management as part of the UNODC’s international criminal justice series. “ *This decision is significant, as the last guidance from the UN on life imprisonment was published in 1994, and the Handbook series is seen as the cornerstone for establishing practical implementation of criminal justice systems at the national level.”* \(I\) 

 This extensive engagement and influence led to the researchers being invited to co\-host an event dedicated to life imprisonment reform at the UN Crime Congress in Kyoto, Japan in April 2020 with PRI \(I\). Due to Covid\-19, the event was postponed to March 2021. Based on the research \(R5, R6\) it was confirmed by the Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations at the event on 9 March 2021 that life imprisonment reform, with a particular focus on the abolition of whole life sentences and life imprisonment for children, will be a major item of the UN's agenda. As the Crime Congress sets the UN priorities for worldwide criminal justice reform for the next five years, it is  anticipated that the research \(R5, R6\) will demonstrate further significant global impact.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 David Sutton is at the forefront of archival best practice and his pioneering work ensures the safety of literary archives at risk. Literary archives are often at greater risk of loss or destruction than other centrally held records which are protected by legislation and strict archiving practice. Sutton’s work has influenced the way literary and personal papers are housed, catalogued and accessed, and is guiding copyright law throughout the world. At an international level he advises and collaborates with organisations including UNESCO, swisspeace and PEN \(Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, Novelists\) International and at a national level he has influenced practice in sub\-Saharan African archives \(Namibia, Malawi and Cameroon\). Sutton has introduced ideas such as “the politics of location”, “split collections” and “appropriate archival home” to international collecting practices. He has caused institutions in richer countries to reflect upon the ethics of their collecting policies while encouraging archivists in less economically developed countries to believe they can and should be building such collections. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Sutton's research traces and analyses the formation of, and issues around, literary archives: What are they? Where are they and where should they be maintained? Who has access to them, and under what terms? His research locates and creates awareness around particular archives and is also research\-as\-practice. Sutton has actively guided governments and international bodies as they recognise the value of their own resources and design archiving policies \(outputs 1\-6\). Sutton has been editing the *Location Register of English Literary Manuscripts* *and Letters*, which is a British Academy research project,  since 1982 and his work continues to build on the University of Reading’s strong reputation for its collections\-based research in literary and publishers’ archives. 

 Sutton is a director of the Diasporic Literary Archives Network \(DLAN\) which was founded in 2012. DLAN, funded by a Leverhulme Trust International Network grant, is led by the University of Reading, with partners in France, Italy, Namibia, Trinidad & Tobago and the USA, and supported by the British Library, International Council on Archives \(ICA\) and UNESCO. The Network promotes international collaboration in the preservation of, and access to, literary archives. It has brought together a group of established scholars and experts from a variety of institutional backgrounds, and across different disciplines and regions, to initiate a context in which to practice and scrutinise methodological and conceptual frameworks. The network has held various workshops and lectures since 2012 from which publications have arisen. Five well\-attended international workshops were held between 2012 and 2014, in the UK, Italy, France, Trinidad and Tobago and the USA. Further workshops, with special focus on literary manuscripts in an African context, have followed in Namibia in 2015 and Cameroon in 2018. DLAN’s activities formed the basis for two important publications in 2018, both edited by David Sutton \(outputs 2 and 3\). 

 Alongside his own publications and work as a director for DLAN, Sutton has written forward\-working papers and guidelines in collaboration with external partners such as The National Archives \(TNA\), the Group for Literary Archives and Manuscripts \(GLAM\), the Society of Authors \(SoA\), UNESCO and the World Intellectual Property Organisation \(outputs 1, 2, 4 and 5\). Sutton is now a consultant advising on literary archives and location registers for the Leverhulme funded project “Caribbean Literary Heritage: Recovering the Lost Past and Safeguarding the future” \(2017\-2021\) which is a successor to the Caribbean Literary Archives strand led by Professor Alison Donnell \(formerly University of Reading, now at the University of East Anglia\).

 **3. References to the research** 

 Sutton’s research has introduced the concept of split collections in literary archiving practice, changing how literary archives catalogue their collections and influencing changes in how copyright law is applied in a literary archive setting. The research meets or exceeds the threshold for 2\*: it has been published in peer\-reviewed professional journals and provides an important point of reference, influencing archive practices and policies nationally and internationally.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

1.  **Impact on policy: literary archives at risk and creating safe havens** 

 In contrast to public record offices, which are protected by a legal superstructure, literary archives are often at greater risk of loss or destruction despite their richness and diversity. Sutton’s expertise is sought\-after internationally. He has provided advice and guidance to agencies throughout the world as increasing numbers of archives are at risk. In particular, his work is ensuring that literary archives and diaspora form an integral part of discussion in the archive and library sector. This is vital if these valuable resources are to be protected. In the UK and Europe the dialogue is centred on why practice should change, particularly ethically, whilst in sub\-Saharan Africa the dialogue is around how to change things in a practical way. Sutton has presented his work in this wide\-ranging activity at important archival and scholarly meetings in Europe, East Asia, Africa and South America. For example, he was invited to speak at the International Council on Archives Annual Conferences in Mexico City, Mexico in November 2017 and in Yaoundé, Cameroon in November 2018. 

 Sutton’s research and expertise has been deeply influential in changing priorities within the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme. The programme originally focussed on recording well\-known treasures, but as a result of guidance from Sutton and DLAN it is now working towards preserving archives at risk. In 2016 Sutton was appointed as a corresponding member of UNESCO’s Sub\-Committee on Education and Research \(SCEaR\) and DLAN was invited to present on closer working with UNESCO’s Memory of the World Programme, International Comparative Literature Association Conference in Vienna \(July 2016, E1\). 

 Sutton is one of only two individual expert members of the UNESCO\-supported project Safe Havens for Archives at Risk. In 2016 swisspeace led an expert working group on archives at risk, as part of the UNESCO project. Sutton was invited to be a facilitator and led the discussions on planning a way forward. He is an author of the group’s professional standards document: *Guiding Principles for Safe Havens for Archives at Risk* which has now been adopted by the International Council on Archives \(E2\). 

1.  **Impact on archivists and archives in sub\-Saharan Africa** 

 Sutton has played a significant part in protecting archives in sub\-Saharan Africa. Two countries have invited him to advise on their future practice, both for archives at risk, and literary and personal papers \(E3\). In 2015, as representative of DLAN, Sutton ran a two\-day conference in Namibia. The conference was attended by archivists, writers, authors, estate\-holders and representatives of the Namibian government. Sutton ran many of the workshops, where delegates discussed why cultural archives are important for new collecting countries; specifics of collecting in Namibia and advice on working with authors/estates. One of the outcomes of the conference was the National Archives of Namibia, beginning their debut programme of collecting personal and literary papers \(E4\). 

 In 2017 Sutton spoke about the work in Namibia at a conference in Malawi and offered to facilitate and advise on work in similar archives. This led to a project focussing on one Malawian author. Another two\-day workshop was run by Sutton in 2018 in Cameroon. It inspired a group of archive students to apply to the Fund for International Development in Archives \(FIDA\) for a project to visit authors around Cameroon to ask about their papers. Sutton supported the successful application and the resulting 15,000 Euros grant made it possible for the students to travel around the country digitising documents. This is now regarded as a model practice for the future. A report from February 2018 states “When we had the workshop with David Sutton there was nothing being collected of this nature in Cameroon at all. We now have thirty archival collections in the National Archives.” These include an important piece of Cameroonian literature – Pabe Mongo’s *The Journal of Wamakoul*, a journal created during the writing of *L’Homme de la Rue –* which is now in the National Archive \(E5\). 

 Namibia and Cameroon present examples of African countries with no previous tradition of collecting literary archives. But, following interventions and solidarity work from Sutton and the DLAN, they began building such collections – with clear recognition, now, that literary archives and other personal papers form as much a part of a country’s cultural heritage as museum artefacts \(E6\). There are plans to expand the project. Kenya and Tanzania are both actively interested in creating their own literary archives, using templates established at Sutton’s workshops in Namibia and Cameroon. 

1.  **Impact on authors and archives** 

 Sutton’s work as a director of DLAN has led to recognition that current authors wishing to dispose of their literary archives need clear guidance on how to do this in the interest of national heritage. This has resulted in a collaboration with TNA, the Society of Authors and the Group for Literary Archives and Manuscripts, who together have produced the working document *Authors & Their Papers.* The final document is widely available, endorsed by the National Archives and approved by the Society of Authors and is now a professional standard within the international archival sector \(E7\). 

1.  **Influencing international copyright law and archives** 

 In January 2019 Sutton was invited to be the representative and adviser on archives to the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s \(WIPO\) General Assembly – a group of approximately 190 country members who comprise a world\-wide assembly modelled on the United Nations \(E8\). Sutton’s knowledge of the challenges facing archives – such as copyright issues \(for personal and literary papers in particular\) and identifying where urgent preservation copies are needed to protect archives – has changed the organisation’s approach to archives. To achieve this, Sutton produced *A Background Paper on the Intersection of Archives and Copyright* which summarised the nature of archives and the way they intersect with copyright legislation. This has the potential to change the way archives are created across the world, especially in low and middle income countries where funds cannot stretch to excessive copyright fees. One copyright expert from Cornell University and Harvard University commented: “Sutton has done the impossible. In the twenty pages in this background paper prepared for the last meeting of \[WIPO, …\] Sutton's descriptive work illustrates wonderfully how copyright rules developed for a commercial environment can hinder the work of memory institutions” \(E9\). 

1.  **Impact on UK archival sector: influencers on international archive sector** 

 Sutton is also influencing the UK archival sector; raising awareness of their influence on and possible collaborations with international archives that can benefit from knowledge exchange and sharing best practice between established and fledgling organisations. For example, Sutton was the keynote speaker on “The Politics of Location Worldwide” at the Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums \(GLAM\) Conference in October 2017. 

 Sutton’s research has enabled the protection of literary archives and is transforming archiving practice in the UK, Europe and Africa through interventions which have enabled literary archives to be created for the first time; changed how archives engage with authors and copyright law and facilitated knowledge exchange between the UK archive sector and the rest of the world.

 **The Harpswell later medieval ‘Landscape and community’ research project** 

 Research directly underpinned impact through the design and delivery of a ‘Landscape and community’ project, which ran through 2016\-18. This charted in detail the medieval and later development of the settlement of Harpswell, Lincolnshire, and its environs. Through the means of a directed community project, research extended knowledge and understanding of Harpswell and its locality, as well as enhanced recognition of its significance in wider regional national terms as a historical, archaeological and heritage site of the later medieval period. Research identified activity spanning the seventh century to the modern period, and included evidence for domestic, industrial, and agricultural activity. This data informs academic understanding of medieval settlement evolution in the region, and feeds into national debates regarding the origin and development of villages and historic landscapes. 

 Professional and volunteer participants deployed a range of archaeological and historical methods, including geophysical surveys, documentary and cartographic investigation, and open area excavation. The project successfully co\-created knowledge and understanding of a particular local landscape, and developed related research practice. 

 To date, publication emerging from this project has included an article for popular/professional readership \(see **Section 5, S4**\), and findings have also informed the content of developing public planning documentation \(see **Section 5, S3**\). 

 **Wider background research** 

 Broader and ongoing research from late 2015 has also advanced and deepened knowledge and understanding of early, mid and later medieval settlements in Britain more generally. Moreover, this informed the site\-specific investigations and interpretations at Harpswell. This more general research has taken as its main areas of focus twelfth century fortified sites and early medieval settlement sites. 

 Research activity, primarily through to 2016, explored the material evidence of the twelfth\-century civil war popularly known as ‘the Anarchy’. This analysed a wide range of artefacts, buildings, castles, siegeworks, fortified monasteries, and bishop’s palaces, as well as field, archival and desk\-top\-based sources. Publications have included an article \(2016\) \( **R3**\) and a joint\-authored monograph \(2016\) \( **R1**\). The monograph attracted recognition in reviews in peer\-reviewed journals, for example:  [*Cambridge Archaeological Journal*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological-journal/article/anarchy-war-and-status-in-12thcentury-landscapes-of-conflict-by-oliver-h-creighton-duncan-w-wright-2017-liverpool-liverpool-university-press-isbn-9781781382424-hardback-288-pp-52-bw-figs-19-colour-pls/2045A77BBCBFC92A1E2F4A65CBD0631D);  [*Journal of British Studies*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320066776_Oliver_H_Creighton_and_Duncan_W_Wright_The_Anarchy_War_and_Status_in_12th-Century_Landscapes_of_Conflict_Exeter_Studies_in_Medieval_Europe_Liverpool_Liverpool_University_Press_2016_Pp_346_12000_cloth); and  [*Landscape History*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01433768.2017.1394087), ‘This is an enormously valuable and engaging book, and it should now become essential reading for any who study Stephen’s reign, Anglo\-Norman warfare, or indeed the social history of twelfth\-century England’. 

 A separate strand explored the high\-status landscapes of early medieval Britain, and in particular investigated the function and status of metalworkers within elite settlement complexes \( **R2**\). Many of these early centres continued as important ecclesiastical and secular centres throughout the medieval and later periods, and this research enhances understanding of the nascent stages of these preeminent places. 

 Further ongoing interest has been directed towards early medieval occupation deposits and artefacts close to historic \(mid\-C19th\) settlement zones, as evident through searches various of datasets. This has recognised the limitations of small\-scale intrusive investigation, the frequency of encountering early medieval settlement in currently occupied environs, and its significance in shaping subsequent settlement and landscape character.

 **4. Details of the impact** – Sources in section 5 are indicated by number \(e.g., **S1**\) 

 The impact achieved between September 2015 and July 2020 was associated primarily with the ‘Landscape and community’ \(Harpswell\) project, but was also reflected in some public engagement events and activity drawing on the other wider and ongoing areas of research interest. 

 **Community and public engagement** 

 Impact associated with the ‘Landscape and community’ project was achieved through BGU’s Annual Digs, 2016 and 2017, directed by Wright, and in other related legacy up to 2020. Impact was reflected in the domains of ‘creativity, culture, and society’ \(collaboration with heritage sector, resulting in enhancements to cultural heritage preservation and interpretation, including exhibitions\); and ‘understanding, learning, and participation’ \(stimulating public interest and engagement in research; enhancing cultural understanding of issues and phenomena; raising awareness and understanding by engaging the public\). 

 These impact types were reflected in: visitor participation, uptake of training, and sustained engagement with groups. This was supported by strategically designed and integrated outreach activities around the Annual Digs. Engagement took place in field and other environments, and beneficiaries were various: lay volunteers \(Lincolnshire Archaeology Group\), students, the local community, regional visitors, and international participants. Opportunities included: excavation, geophysical survey, and post\-excavation analysis and conservation. 

 Site open days at the Harpswell Digs in 2016 and 2017 were delivered with support from other stakeholders \(such as, the Collection Museum, Lincoln; Lincolnshire County Council Portable Antiquities Scheme; LAG\) \- over 1,000 visitors attended. 

-  ‘The excavation produced huge interest from those living locally … open days were held for both years, \(combined with open garden days at Hall Farm\) … a number of stands were organised, both for adults and children and involving hands\-on activities, by other local historical and archaeological organisations. The Open Days were a huge success, not just in the number of attendees but also in their enthusiasm and the amount of time they stayed to see and take a part in everything. A highlight were the brilliant explications given of the site to large groups of visitors at regular intervals’ \( **S1**\). 

-  ‘Largely because of 2016/17 research, LAG members felt more confident, and better skills\-equipped, in undertaking other archaeological investigations independently of BGU. Another key element of learning was a better understanding of the importance of setting clear research aims and outputs. Subsequently LAG raised funds during 2018 and has completed an excavation at two more areas of the field at Hall Farm Harpswell during 2019. The areas were chosen following discussions with the researchers’ \( **S2**\). 

 On completion, a permanent exhibition was installed at Harpswell. Results of geophysical survey were published in the *Medieval Archaeology Newsletter* \( **S3**\). A legacy initiative was established by LAG, a community archaeology society and project partner, resulting in a subsequent fieldwork season directed by them in 2018. 

-  ‘The BGU project has very effectively demonstrated a model of how this can be done \( **S1**\). 

-  ‘It is clear that the archaeological research by the BGU excavations of 2016 and 2017 have led to significant positive impacts on, and development of, the Lincoln Archaeology Group’ \( **S2**\). 

 Impact was also achieved in the domain of ‘impacts on the environment’, with current and future environmental policy and planning decisions being informed by research evidence. Findings formed the basis of a LCC Character Assessment \( **S4**\), which became available to support the development of Hemswell and Harpswell Council’s Neighbourhood Plan, from January 2020. 

-  ‘The BGU project has had significant ongoing effects on the status and protection of the site’ \(informing potential extension of the Scheduled Monument Order, renewal of the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, and application of the Character Assessment\) \( **S1**\). 

 The 2018 BGU Annual Dig was held at the University’s new Lincoln Newport site \(LORIC\). Ongoing community engagement was more limited, due to the physical constraints of the site. However, the excavation hosted public open days, and in\-situ live broadcasting by BBC Radio Lincolnshire with accompanying social media coverage \( **S5**\). 

 **Public lectures, talks and publication** 

 Some further public impact was achieved from September 2015, in the domain of ‘understanding, learning, and participation’ \(stimulating public interest and engagement in research\). 

 This was reflected in event and writing activities, with beneficiaries being general public audiences/readerships: 

-  **1 magazine article** for popular archaeology \( *Current Archaeology*\) \( **S6**\); 

-  **15 public talks** to: Cambridge Antiquarian Society, Spirit of Sutterby Group \(3 talks\); Council for British Archaeology East Midlands, Hough\-on\-the\-Hill History Group, Louth Naturalists Antiquarian and Literary Society, Nettleham Archaeology Group, Historical Association \(Lincoln\), Society for Lincolnshire History and Archaeology \(3 talks\), Torpel Manor Archaeological Project, The Collection \(Lincoln\), and Wallingford Historical and Archaeological Society.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 As a result of Dr. Voulgarakis’ extensive body of work on global and regional climate physics and science, he was invited to be the lead climate expert for the first ever Climate Change Risk Assessment for the Government of Cyprus. He provided information regarding atmospheric physics and regional climate change which was subsequently used by impact scientists \(experts on agriculture, biodiversity, built environment, business, energy, forestry, natural disasters, health, fisheries, transport, and water resources\) to provide a complete risk assessment on the effects of climate change in Cyprus. 

 Following on from the risk assessment, Dr Voulgarakis’ research provided the evidence that directly informed the first National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change which was approved by the Parliament of Cyprus, and the Cypriot National Action Plan on climate. Beneficiaries include policy makers, sectors of green industry, and the wider population of Cyprus through primarily agriculture, forest, biodiversity, soils, public health and water. Broader impact includes influence on similar efforts in other Eastern Mediterranean countries with the formation of the Cyprus Government’s Initiative for Coordinating Climate Change Action in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impact reported here built on the extensive expertise developed on regional climate physics and change and its impacts conducted by Voulgarakis’s team over the last decade, utilizing state\-of\-the\-art \(“IPCC \(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\)\-class”\) climate models for which Voulgarakis’s team are acknowledged as the key specialists at Imperial, having established a dominant international reputation, as evidenced by their many international collaborations in this area. 

 Voulgarakis has been a key member and contributor **\[1\]** to the international ACCMIP \(Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Modelling Intercomparison Project\), which has provided an invaluable resource for exploring issues of climate sensitivity, historical climate behaviour and importantly climate projections **\[1\-3\]**. The associated comparison of different models together with observations related to atmospheric chemistry were used to evaluate the understanding of the interactions between atmospheric chemistry and climate. Particular emphasis was placed on simulations of tropospheric ozone and aerosols, both which exert substantial climate forcing which varies considerably in space and time. Methane, arising from human activity is the second most important greenhouse gas in the climate system and can be removed by oxidation. The oxidation reaction depends strongly on the levels of the hydroxyl radical present, which can also remove other trace pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and hydrofluorocarbon and Volulgarakis was the lead author on the key paper predicting future chemical lifetime for these key components **\[2\]**. Fires, in particular biomass burning, are responsible for a range of gaseous and aerosol emissions. Voulgarakis and colleagues investigated biomass burning emissions as a driver of interannual variability of large\-scale abundances of short\-lived constituents such as carbon monoxide \(CO\), hydroxyl radicals \(OH\), ozone and aerosols, and demonstrated that there are strong implications of wildfire variability for air quality and climate **\[4\]**. 

 Such expertise and accumulated experience led to Voulgarakis being invited as the lead climate change expert in the Assessment, in order to provide estimates of future climate change over Cyprus to the wide range of impact scientists involved. The culmination of this were the Evidence Report **\[5\]** \(which analysed and presented the climate change impacts on all economic sectors examined, and therefore was the central document produced\) and the accompanying Climate Change Report **\[6\]** \(which provided the information needed in order to analyse and estimate the climate change impacts in the various sectors\). Overall, the aims of the reports were to provide the best information available on the vulnerability of Cyprus to climate change, identifying notable risks and opportunities and gaps in our current understanding. This was the first such study ever undertaken for Cyprus, while no similar study has ever been conducted for other countries in the Eastern Mediterranean area, including Greece. Thus, this study was an important pilot that can affect the future of climate change risk and impact assessments for the wider region. 

 The future climate change prediction data that mostly drove this analysis was based on unique regional climate models that participated in the leading regional climate model intercomparison project focusing on Europe, i.e. EURO\-CORDEX, and its counterpart focusing specifically on the Mediterranean \(MED\-CORDEX\). Members of our team \(particularly Christos Giannakopoulos at Imperial\) have been key participants in these intercomparisons. Our research was enriched with information gathered from the wider literature, to complement the main analysis of EURO\-CORDEX and MED\-CORDEX model data. The future climate change analysis was led by Voulgarakis who wrote the associated report \[6\] \(working through Imperial Consultants, ICON\) from July 2015 to April 2016. 

 The study addressed 12 “sectors” \(or research areas\) and drew evidence from literature reviews, expert elicitation and more detailed quantitative analysis conducted by our research team, where the data allowed. It incorporated feedback from stakeholders in these sectors, in order to identify potential impacts and to select risk sectors for more detailed analysis. A Sector Report was produced for each sector that included identification of risk metrics, development of response functions, an adaptive capacity assessment, mapping of competent authorities and quantification of the magnitude of the risks. 

 The overall project \(“The Cyprus Climate Change Risk Assessment”\) was led by Advanced Environmental Studies \(Adens\) SA, a high\-profile environmental consulting company based in Athens that undertook the project, which was to start with supported by the Cypriot Government. The company approached me \(Voulgarakis\) to be the Lead Climate Scientist, and I worked on this role through Imperial Consultants. The direct project’s budget was 160,000 euros. The contract between Adens SA and myself was effective from July 2015 to April 2016 and was for \~£20,000. The work was also based on a large body of work pursued in preceding years, conducted both by our team and others and supported by a variety of sources \(e.g. NERC studentships at Imperial that Voulgarakis supervised, an EU Marie Curie IRSES project in which Voulgarakis was the Imperial Co\-I, a British Council UKIERI\-UGC Grant in which Voulgarakis was the PI, collaborations with the Met Office that provided supercomputing resources to the group of Voulgarakis etc\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The focus of the research was to provide the first ever Climate Change Risk Assessment for the Government of Cyprus. Dr Voulgarakis \(representing Imperial\) was the leading climate change expert in this work, based on his extensive experience in the area of regional climate change, and provided all the climate information that was then used by impact scientists in Greece and Cyprus \(experts on agriculture, biodiversity, built environment, business, energy forestry, natural disasters, health, fisheries, transport, and water resources\) in the different chapters of the Assessment Report **\[A, B\]**. 

 The Government\-appointed reviewer of the Climate Change Risk Assessment report and Associate Professor \(and climate expert\) at the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia states that “ *The climate change analysis carried out by Dr Voulgarakis and his team was critical in the success of the overall CY\-CCRA Evidence Report. It provided the necessary data input for the impact sector studies that quantified the climate change driven risks in the environment society\-economy spectrum of the country. The CY\-CCRA outcome has importantly shaped the Cyprus Government’s Climate Change National Adaptation Plan.*” **\[C\]**. 

 The major impact achieved is that our assessment was the main evidence that directly informed and shaped the first National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change that was successfully voted into legislation by the Parliament of Cyprus on the 18<sup>th</sup> May 2017 **\[D\]**. There were two workshops between Government representatives and the project’s team which enabled the communication of information to the stakeholders. Our work provided the evidence for justifying and applying the National Strategy to Climate Change Adaptation \(NSACC\) \(which involved a National Action Plan \(NAP\)\), which was finalised by the Department of Environment in April 2017 and approved by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus on 18 May 2017 **\[D\]**. The Cyprus Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Observatory \(CYCLADAPT\) project directly addresses adaptation measures covering most of the NAP sectors and primarily agriculture, forest, biodiversity, soils, public health and water \(submitted September 2018, T. Mesimeris, personal communication\). The implementation of the NAP is expected to bring substantial benefits to the environment and society in the long\-term, as it foresees a total of 57 measures **\[D\]**.  The NSACC and NAP can be found \(in Greek\) in **\[E\]** and **\[F\]**. 

 Beneficiaries include policy makers with Government of Cyprus, various sectors of industry, and the wider society of Cyprus. Specifically, the NAP addresses adaption in eleven key impact sectors: Water resources; Soils; Coastal areas; Biodiversity; Agriculture; Forest; Fisheries and aquaculture; Public health; Energy; Tourism; Infrastructure **\[D\]**. Example measures included in the NAP are the expansion of water use efficiency meters by the Agricultural Ministry, installation of new technologies in forests for the early detection of new climate\-related diseases, the creation of new green spaces in cities, and many others. Broader implications of our work include influence on similar efforts that will be undertaken in the future in other countries and regions of the Eastern Mediterranean \(e.g. Greece and countries of the Middle East\). Our work also provided the evidence for follow\-up international initiatives by the Government of Cyprus **\[D\]**. 

 This research impacted the whole population of Cyprus, 1.1 million people, as well as the many visitors and tourists to the country. The impact concerns the whole population, as climate change impacts are ubiquitous and affect all sectors of society, e.g. through changes in weather leading to increased flooding and to changes in energy demand for cooling, increase in pollution, and impacts on health and agriculture due to increased average temperatures, all of which are areas covered in our report. 

 Given the expected indirect influence of our work on similar efforts in other nations of the Eastern Mediterranean \(we know that currently there are similar assessments planned for different peripheries of Greece, which will be influenced by our work\), we expect our research to influence tens of millions of people. 

 Monetisation of the risks has been discussed in the final session of the report, though a total value from all sectors was not provided. However, indicative estimates have been provided for individual sectors; for example, for the 2050s and under the moderate RCP4.5 scenario, we identified potential annual costs exceeding €1M in three impact metrics \(properties exposed to flooding and insurance premiums; temperature morbidity\) and exceeding €10M in other three \(energy demand for cooling; people exposed to flooding; temperature mortality\). 

 The Head of the Climate Action and Energy Unit at the Department of Environment highlights the influence this report had on the wider region. He says that “ *The Cyprus Climate Change Risk Assessment evidence report was one of the contributing factors to the development of the “The Cyprus Government Initiative for Coordinating Climate Change Actions in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East \(EMME\)” launched by H.E. President Anastasiades in March 2019. The initiative aims at the development of a Regional Action Plan to address the specific needs and challenges counties are facing in the mitigation actions in accordance with the Paris Agreement”* **\[D\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted by the University of Bolton in collaboration with University of Cambridge has significantly enhanced the capabilities within the fields of gas detection and particle monitoring. The EPSRC funded project \(EP/F062966/1\) led to the development and commercialization of advanced film bulk acoustic resonator \(FBAR\) sensors. Sorex Sensors Ltd. was formed by Cambridge Enterprise following the award of international patent, WO2013088163A1 to pursue commercialisation of this new technology. To date, Sorex Sensors Ltd. have generated a total of £2.1M in funding, employed six people and have an annual turnover of £500k per year.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research and development of the wireless sensor technology commenced in 2010 with an EPSRC funded \[G1\], £1.2M project, led by Prof. Luo at University of Bolton in collaboration with Universities of Cambridge and Manchester. The project led to the development of extremely high sensitivity sensors that are able to detect changes in mass as small as a few femtograms, the similar mass as a single virus. By coating the sensor surface with specific materials, the devices are able to respond to presence of particular biological and chemical targets, thus can be tailored for specific detection and monitoring applications. 

 The advancements documented in \[3.1\] highlight several advantages of the FBAR devices over pre\-existing sensors: \(a\) they have extremely high mass sensitivity, down to a few femtograms; \(b\) they are very small in size, typically 100x100 to 200x200 µm<sup>2</sup>, therefore allowing  arrangement into arrays to enable measurement of multiple targets simultaneously; \(c\) the sensors have an incredibly low power requirement, allowing them to be operated by a coin cell battery in mobile phone or by energy harvesting from an RFID device; and \(d\) the sensor has dual\-wave mode, thus allowing detection/sensing of two\-parameters using one sensor, or one sensor with self\-temperature calibration capability negating need for additional electronics for temperature calibration \[3.1\]. 

 The breakthrough made within the research therefore led to the granting of an international patent \(PCT/GB2012/053139\) due to the identification of environmental sensor changes and temperature sensor changes with a two\-layer bulk resonator. The patent was granted validating the sensors’ novel capability to overcome previous challenges in regard to temperature compensation. The new sensors enable separated detection of resonances as they behave differently in response to temperature changes in contrast to stress changes. 

 The technical development of the sensors is documented in \[3.2, 3.3, 3.6\] and evidences the extent to which a shift in one or both of the piezoelectric layer resonant frequency and the combination resonant frequency is detected with the portion of the shift caused by a temperature change, and can be separated from that caused by an environmental change, realizing one sensor based detection with temperature calibration. 

 Following the successful development of the technology, Luo then expanded the research into smart fire protection products in collaboration with TBA Textile Ltd, funded by the KTP scheme \[G2\]. The research utilised the know\-how gained from the previous project to develop a wireless sensor chip with integrated temperature and humidity sensors, and other electronics, capable of sensing and reporting the fire environment, the fire location and movement, towards the development of active fire protection products. 

 Since 2018 Luo’s research has continued into integrating FBAR sensor technology within a wireless sensor system for convenient, reliable and low\-cost screening and diagnosis of obstructive sleeping apnea \(OSA\) in mass populations. This led to a KTP project \[G3\] with Passion for Life Healthcare for the development of an innovative app\-enabled flexible wireless sensor chip which fits on the upper lip, with the potential to detect OSA in a comfortable and reduced stress environment.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research led by Bolton has delivered the underpinning science and technology for developing new FBAR devices that have significantly enhanced the accessible functionality and capability of next generation chemical and physical sensors. The high performance and lower cost proposition of the FBAR based technology gained support from Cambridge Enterprises, which then led to the creation of Sorex Sensors Ltd. The arising intellectual property has since been protected through the granted patent: WO2013088163A1 and commercialisation of the technology is being led by Sorex Sensors Ltd., of which Andrew Flewitt, Prof. Luo’s co\-investigator during the EPSRC funded project \(EP/F062966/1\) is on the board of Directors. 

 To date, Sorex Sensors Ltd have generated a total of £2.1M in seed funding, employs six people and has an annual turnover of just over £500k per year. The company operates in a well\-established global market for sensors estimated to be £133 billion in 2019 growing to £249 billion by 2024 \(a CAGR of 13.3%\) \[5.1\]. In 2018, The University of Bolton also received £1120 in fees associated to the patent recognition of the instrumental role Prof. Luo played in the development of the new technology \[5.2, 5.3\]. 

 In October 2019, Sorex Sensors Ltd. launched its first product of which Andrew Flewitt cited the FBAR sensor as a central component in his supporting statement. The product which would not have been possible without the development of the FBAR technology utilises the sensors’ versatility by creating a platform to enable developers to incorporate the FBAR sensor within a broad range of lab\-on\-chip applications such as the monitoring of indoor air quality. The product consists of marketing the FBAR sensor alongside a development kit to enable end users to visualize the data collated by the sensor. Currently, the sensor and the development kit are designed to be utilised within semiconductor manufacturing equipment, such as atomic layer deposition systems, where it can monitor amounts and deposition rates of ultrathin films. 

 Since its initial development, this FBAR sensor technology has been identified as having a broad range of applications, particularly within the fields of gas detection and particle monitoring. Sorex stated that they are continuing to utilise the lab\-on\-chip FBAR sensor technology developed by Prof. Luo to target applications in monitoring of the indoor air quality \[5.2\].  In Andrew Flewitt’ s wording: 

 *There is also emerging evidence that poor indoor air quality is an indicator of a high risk of COVID being spread in the environment. As such, we believe that this technology has the potential to have a highly beneficial impact on everyone’s health and wellbeing in the medium term.* 

 The development of FBAR sensors has also led to an increased capacity within the field of wireless sensor and their capabilities. As a result of the new thin film acoustic wave devices researchers around the world now have the capability to explore and develop integrated, disposable, and flexible lab\-on\-chip devices into various sensing and actuating applications, particularly in biochemical sensors, physical sensors, wireless sensor networks for Internet of Things, smart manufacturing, smart city etc. 

 The FBAR sensor consists of a metal\-thin film piezoelectric material\-metal sandwich resonating structure of the size of 100x100μm<sup>2</sup>, and can be fabricated by CMOS\-compatible process, which ensures the low cost and mass production. This is a result of the sensor design which changes the resonant frequency of the device, providing an extremely accurate measurement of the amount of mass on the sensor. Furthermore, the sensor uses microwatts for power and can detect changes in mass down to femtograms the same order of magnitude of mass of a single virus. Combining all these factors and increased capacity means the new FBAR sensor is not only the most accurate sensor available but also the most cost effective and readily manufactured using established industrial processes, therefore has both a significant economic and environmental impact.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2015, research by Bath Spa University’s Hazard, Risk and Disaster Group \(HRD\) in countries on the Development Assistance Committee’s \(DAC\) list has increased resilience to climate change and disaster risk challenges; conditions which otherwise disproportionally afflict exposed and vulnerable communities. Focusing on Kiribati \(Micronesia\) and the Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh \(Indian Himalayan Region\), research contributed to: the improvement of local community understanding, voice, and action with regard to environmental and disaster risk reduction management challenges; the reframing of climate change as a cultural challenge, achieving empathetic reach internationally through film screenings and public dialogue; the development of disaster risk policy at local and regional levels; and the generation of enterprise and client gain by seeding a film production house in India and a children’s literature authorial career in the UK. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Climate change, sustainable development and disaster risk are interrelated global challenges which are particularly acute and less well understood in sensitive/remote high\-mountain and low\-elevation island settings. Here the most vulnerable communities are often doubly disadvantaged, possessing the least agency in decision\-making processes. The underpinning research led by Johnson and Penrhyn Jones with international collaborators, over a period of more than 5 years in such locations has generated and responded to this. The India and Kiribati portfolios share thematic foci and methodological approaches, with film serving as a method of research, engagement and impact. Combined, this approach promoted understanding and agency within and between local communities and government, in relation to global debates. 

 **India** 

 Since 2013, Johnson and Edwards’ research focused on the Kullu District, which is experiencing a high frequency of hazard events and increasing disaster risk. This stems from multiple stressors associated with climate change/variability, population change, expanding resource utilisation and rapid infrastructure development. The research has developed and connected understanding of flood disaster impacts and community responses; historical flood chronologies in the Kullu District, 1846 onwards, via UGC\-UKIERI funded project  [<ins>HiFlo</ins><ins>\-DAT</ins>](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/projects/hiflo-dat-hazard-database/) \(2018\-2020\); and disaster risk reduction strategies to enhance community resilience. 

 Early empirical research \(2013\-2018\), including with the University of Manitoba \[redacted text\] and the University of Winnipeg \[redacted text\], focused on field\-based reconstruction of flash floods, exploration of existing post\-disaster community vulnerability and resilience through concepts of heritage and capital \(R1\), and also piloted film production \(2013\-2014, section 4\). These enabled a more detailed understanding of the causation, impact cascade and responses to an August 1994 Kullu District flood disaster, than had previously been reported. It also highlighted that the availability and use of both formal and local knowledge is pivotal to mountain community disaster risk reduction and resilience in the region, which is heavily affected by prevailing government policy. 

 Building on and consolidating these foundations, in partnership with the GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment \(GBPNIHE\) and Kraft Films, the 2018\-2020 ‘Pathways to Resilience’ research used film in conjunction with public engagement activities. It has deepened analysis of local knowledge of hazard events and approaches to disaster risk governance \(R2\). This has culminated in research\-led policy\-practice change recommendations to Indian government and NGO stakeholders \(R3\). The portfolio of underpinning research has revealed a pressing need to question the significant under\-utilisation of informal local knowledge of hazard events and adaptation by current disaster risk governance models in India. It also demonstrated the need to both address poor understanding amongst indigenous and refugee communities of existing disaster management policy, and capture their substantial desire to become involved in new Disaster Risk Reduction \(DRR\) efforts. These findings reveal the value and opportunity afforded by film to enhance DRR knowledge exchange. 

 **Kiribati** 

 Penrhyn Jones also uses film to shape interdisciplinary research agendas \(R4\-6\). As Co\-investigator on the UK research project 'Towards Hydrocitizenship' \(AHRC, 2014\-2017\), Penrhyn Jones found that environmental communication should develop a community’s own capacity for storytelling and action \(R6\). There was also value in exploring climate change in exploratory, authentic ways, through local attachments; findings later embodied in her film *TIMELINE* \(R5, 2017\). The emergence of this insight both underpinned and was reinforced by Penrhyn Jones' work in Kiribati \(supported by initial UK coastal case studies\), developed through two AHRC\-funded research projects which she led from 2015 to 2018. Exploring climate change and heritage through documentary film \( *Troubled Waters*, R4, 2015\), three key findings emerged \(2015\-2016\). Firstly, understanding climate change and displacement in Kiribati requires engagement with a very specific indigenous relationship to land and water. Secondly, there was local researcher fatigue and frustration with global media representation. Thirdly, although climate change poses an existential threat, other environmental issues are also important to communities. In response to these findings, Penrhyn Jones’ further research in Kiribati \(2016\-2018\) adapted, taking a participatory turn. The project involved collaboration with a local artist and heritage expert to celebrate indigenous knowledge in a film and worked with a local environmental organisation \(KiriCAN\) to address local environmental priorities.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Climate change and hazard processes are key stressors in driving the exposure, vulnerability, and disaster losses of remote communities, especially those located in sensitive high mountains and coastal lowlands. Evidence for the positive difference made to these communities in India and Kiribati encompass 4 areas: firstly, engaging local community understanding, voice and action; secondly, enhanced understanding of the cultural impacts of climate change via international advocacy; thirdly, DRR policy development pathways; and finally, enterprise generation/ client gain. The first, second and third areas of impact are fundamentally interconnected; understanding drives policy \(and vice versa\), and international advocacy highlights issues focussing policy evolution and resourcing to address global challenges. 

###  Local Community Understanding, Voice and Action 

 In India, Johnson and Edwards, in partnership with GBPNIHE and Kraft Films, produced participatory bilingual documentary films \(R2, underpinned by R1\). These provided a platform for the voices of indigenous villagers and Tibetan refugees to articulate community knowledge of past disaster impacts and adaptation. Film screenings developed understanding across the wider community, Kullu District government and NGOs. For example, in June 2018, following film screenings, 10 local community members and officials expressed their changed understanding, motivating them to enhance DRR efforts \(E2, p5; E3, p2\). This impact is demonstrated in the following comments: a local villager – “You have told us about natural disaster, a calamity, flood, which came. I want to tell that when we’re young we don’t remember anything and today when you told us we felt that we should increase… information so that we can save ourselves from disaster and increase awareness amongst people on how to save themselves” \(E3, p2\); and an official from the Central Tibetan Authority – “We learnt a lot about disaster risk and their respective managements. It triggered a sense of responsibility towards climate change; it gave us \[knowledge of\] how to approach the \[District government\] management committee” \(E2, p5; E3, p2\). More broadly, the leading Himachal Pradesh State and Kullu District disaster management authorities report that the research has benefited them, providing access to new community knowledge and influencing their DRR management \(E2, p5 and E3, p2\). These forms of impact contrast with the longitudinal survey evidence \(E2, p2\-3\) collected in April 2018, prior to the film screenings. Based on 50 respondents in 10 key villages in the study area, this evidence revealed a low level of hazard/ disaster education \(18%\) and awareness \(44%\). Encouragingly, 75% who interacted with Johnson and Edwards \(2012\-2018\) then spoke about their experience with family/ friends, demonstrating a successful mechanism to extend understanding, realised by the films \(R2\). 

 There was extensive local reach with films engaging 630 people, including 210 local community members, at 5 mountain village events in the Phojal Nalla study area \(E2, p4\), with an average attendance of 12.5% of each village population, based on 2011 census data. In total, there were 19 film screenings and allied discussion workshops \(E1, p2\), including at the famous Kullu International Dussehra festival. Further public reach of the films was achieved using print and broadcast media \(E1, p3\). In October 2018 this included 4 leading Hindi newspaper articles \( *Aapka Faisla*, *Amar Ujala*, *Danik Jagram* and *Punjab Kesari*, comprising a daily issue readership of 800,000\-17,500,000\) and TV broadcasts \(Zee News, across the states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, with a population of approximately 60,000,000\). Social media and the Kullu District government  [<ins>webpage</ins>](https://hpkullu.nic.in/pathways-to-resilience/) hosting also resulted in 1,446 Vimeo and 2,095 YouTube plays \(to 31 December 2020, E1, p4\). 

 Despite the global focus on Kiribati as a ‘drowning nation’, KiriCAN, a local environmental organisation, argues that they will drown in rubbish before they drown in water \(E7, p5\). Resourced by projects led by Penrhyn Jones, KiriCAN consulted with 3 communities in South Tarawa, identifying waste as the most urgent issue. Endemic communicable diseases are connected to poor waste management and Kiribati's high infant mortality rate. KiriCAN decided to buy 2 trucks that could collect rubbish, and to train volunteers to use them. They reported: “\[this\] will impact people on a community level... it will have a lot of positive impact on children, you know, clean water... because the rubbish will end up in our drinking source, the spread of mosquitoes, and with the recent outbreak of dengue fever, diarrhoea, so it will all connect to health. It won't solve the issue altogether but help minimise it”\(E7, p5\). Local cooperation successes can also lead to greater community engagement on a range of challenges, seeding longer term impact: “When we talk about waste \[the villagers\] really want to… solve it, but they are losing hope, because their rubbish doesn't get picked up. So what is the point of picking up our rubbish if at the end there is no collection? ... the trucks will give them hope… we can clean up our village” \(E7, p5\-6\). Similarly, amplifying local voices and valuing local knowledge, an indigenous artist appreciated being facilitated to drive the artistic filmmaking process: “As far as I know you are the first filmmakers or researchers that are working… almost full time with a person like me. This is very new and it's unusual. I think it's very effective and you're... following the eye of the informant...to the places where the information is located... it's like the information that I have, and my eyes, is in the frame of your camera” \(E7, p7\). 

###  Enhanced Understanding of Cultural Impacts of Climate Change via International Advocacy 

 The *Troubled Waters* film \(R4\) and associated resources have achieved significant international reach. The International National Trust Organisation \(INTO\), a project partner, reported that the film is an incredibly useful advocacy tool, with enormous impact internationally for getting the message across about the dire effects of climate change on cultural heritage \(E8, p2\-3\). Before it was shown at their conference \(Bali, 2017\), “some... members from industrialised nations... had not, until then, appreciated the effects that their country was having on small island states.” INTO screened the film at United Nations Climate Change conferences in Marrakech, Bonn and Katowice \(2016, 2017, 2018\), reaching approximately 300 people in their booth and 2,000 through side events \(E8, p2\-3\). Further screenings by the project team included events in the UK, Montreal, Gothenburg, Munich and Rhode Island, 2016\-2017 \(E9, p2\-7\). 

 The National Trust \(NT\), also project partners, used the film to communicate connections “between climate change, heritage, and people's lives... equipping the next generation of... cultural heritage professionals to better understand the issues.” Research findings \(2015\-2016, including UK and Kiribati case studies\) informed their coastal work. Penrhyn Jones' piece on the research for the NT's internal magazine, *Views* \(October 2017\), reached thousands of Trust staff and volunteers, making “an important contribution \[to\] the conversation around the impacts of climate change at our coastal places.” Research collaboration led to further impacts, contributing in part to the NT's confidence to engage in a partnership project with Gwynedd County Council looking at enhancing community resilience in 2020 \(E8, p4\-5\). 

 After attending the event 'Drowning in Art' \(Bala, 2015\), a prominent Welsh author wrote in her column, “Sara Penrhyn Jones \[made the theme\] painfully contemporary... the anguish \[in Kiribati\] was conveyed... everyone became sombre” \( *Herald*, *Daily Post*, 2015\). She notes that this experience has motivated her since 2016; her local cooperative group has been increasingly active, instigating a sustainable food project, and a climate action facilitator in 2020 \(E8, p6\-7\). *Planet* magazine note that perspectives from Kiribati enriched the heritage loss debate and Penrhyn Jones’ photography generated pathos and empathy \(E8, p8\). 

###  Disaster Risk Reduction Policy Development Pathways 

 A June 2020 policy briefing \(R3\), substantially led by Johnson, delivered recommendations for new disaster risk reduction interventions to government disaster management authorities across the Indian Himalayan Region. Significantly, this has influenced their thinking about community\-based disaster risk reduction approaches, resulting in a public commitment to future policy revision. For example, in reference to the key policy document \(i.e. the State Disaster Management Plan,  [2017 version](https://hpsdma.nic.in/admnis/admin/showimg.aspx?ID=3351)\) in August 2020, \[redacted text\] the Himachal Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority \(HPSDMA, the key responsible agency\) \(E4, p1\),  stated: “Next year \[2021\] onwards we will be undertaking \[a\] comprehensive revision of the \[2017\] plans. It is \[a\] very good suggestion on \[Johnson’s\] part that there has to be a specific chapter and focus on community\-based disaster management, on village disaster management committees – their roles/ structure/ guiding principles… we will implement it, that’s one commitment I can give from my side.” The government agencies’ implementation of this policy has been delayed by Covid\-19, as detailed in the affected case study statement. 

 Multiple platforms were used to promote and discuss this policy brief, bringing wide reach. Web\-hosting included  [<ins>BSU data repository</ins>](https://doi.org/10.17870/bathspa.c.5036990.v1),  [<ins>GBPNIHE</ins>](http://www.gbpihed.gov.in/index.php), the  [<ins>All India Disaster Mitigation Institute</ins>](http://www.aidmi.org/whatsnew.aspx),  [<ins>United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction</ins>](https://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/72456?&a=email&utm_source=pw_email) and  [<ins>Zurich Flood Resilience Portal</ins>](https://floodresilience.net/resources/item/accelerating-change-engaging-local-communities-in-disaster-risk-reduction-in-the-indian-himalayan-region/),  supplemented by articles in leading Indian newspapers including  [<ins> *The Tribune*</ins>](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/empower-locals-to-deal-with-natural-disasters-scientists-112555) \(1,487 e\-version views\),  [<ins> *Times of India*</ins>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TMCcCX9Q_x4qanxcIDqeL0Ni4dlekDUu/view?usp=sharing) and *Punjab Kesari*. A webinar \(August 2020, 59 attendees\) brought direct engagement with 14 NGOs, 4 \(of 12\) State governments across the Indian Himalayan Region, and 7 \(of 12\) District governments in Himachal Pradesh. As a consequence of these engagements, in the period June to December 2020, the science policy brief received 640 views and 92 downloads from 19 nations, via the BSU data repository \(E4, p2\). 

###  Enterprise Generation and Client Gain 

 The first interdisciplinary film pilot \(2013\-2014\) included 2 creative writing appointees, whose research roles catalysed their entrepreneurial careers, delivering economic impacts and wider client gains. In April 2014 appointee 1, now a children’s author, expressed a renewed desire to write a children’s book set in the Himalayas \(E5, p1\). More recently \(2020\) they stated, “I participated in Bath Spa University’s India research project… which had a direct impact on the emergence and growth of my publishing career \[and\] on my self\-confidence and ability to carry out this \[novel\] research, by improving my knowledge and skills.” Their first 2 novels set in the Indian Himalayas achieved notable reach and significance \(E5, p2\-8\). *Running on the Roof of the World* \(2017\) was chosen as a “future classic” by Booktrust, sending \[redact\] copies to UK schools, and selling a total of \[redact\] copies by June 2019. In August 2020, Amazon’s children’s book bestsellers top 100 list ranked this book 8<sup>th</sup> in the emigration/ immigration category. *When the Mountains Roared* \(2018\) was chosen by Booktrust’s Bookbuzz reading programme reaching approximately \[redacted\] UK students, selling \[redacted       \] in the first year. The author’s first 3 novels generated approximately \[redacted text\] in UK revenue and the reviews attest to their societal value: “A cracking adventure and survival novel set in the Himalayas which really makes you think about the plight of the Tibetan people” \( *Irish Independent*\); “\[it\] taught me… the importance of friendship and family, love, kindness, protecting animals and the planet” \( *National Geographic Kids*\). 

 In 2015, appointee 2, now a film director reflected on the connection between Johnson’s Kullu research and their career aspirations: “At some point in the near future, I will start developing this idea… I like cameras and I like writing, why not combine both to tell meaningful and impactful stories” \(E6, p2\-15\). Shortly afterwards, in August 2016, they founded their film company.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at the University of Southampton \(UoS\) have developed and patented the engineering of nonlinear optical materials for highly efficient wavelength conversion with lasers. This has underpinned the original creation and ongoing development of spinout company **Covesion Ltd**. Over the impact period, Covesion has become a leader in the supply of crystals and packaged products for use in laser, anti\-missile, imaging and quantum technology systems across the defence, communications, laser manufacturing and medical sectors. This has generated the following multi\-faceted economic impact over the eligible period: 

-  Tripling of annual company turnover from 2014 to 2020 \[text removed for publication\] 

-  Doubling of the company workforce with the creation of six high\-skilled roles. 

-  \[text removed for publication\] 

-  Enabling UK industry \(mostly start\-ups and SMEs\) to win GBP5.48m in direct income from the UK Government’s National Quantum Technologies Programme. 

-  Supporting the development of the UK’s sovereign capability in quantum technologies.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Engineered nonlinear optical materials are used to change the wavelength of laser light for numerous applications. ‘Quasi\-phase\-matching’ is a key technique for achieving efficient wavelength conversion. It involves compensating the relative phase between two or more frequencies of light as they propagate through a crystal. It is necessary for the phase relation between the input and generated photons to be maintained throughout the crystal so that the number of generated photons exiting the crystal is maximised. PPLN – periodically poled lithium niobate – is an engineered, quasi\-phase\-matched material; the orientation of the lithium niobate crystal is periodically inverted to avoid the photons slipping out of phase with each other. This means the number of generated photons will grow as the light propagates through the PPLN crystal, yielding a high conversion efficiency. 

 UoS research into PPLN was instigated in the School of Physics by Hanna, who with Shepherd and colleagues from the Optoelectronics Research Centre \(ORC\) optimised the use of PPLN for efficient power conversion at different wavelengths, including for near\-infrared \(long wavelength\) operation \[ **3.1**\]. Hanna was a founder of Stratophase Ltd, a company spun out and funded by UoS in 2003, in order to commercialise the technology. 

 From this, the ORC developed a new technological process for the periodic poling of magnesium oxide \(MgO\) doped PPLN crystals that allowed them to be used in higher power laser applications and over a wider range of wavelengths. This new process allowed the MgO doped PPLN to be fabricated with sufficient reliability and at lower temperatures for commercial applications. 

 The MgO:PPLN process was licensed to Covesion Ltd, a company spun out from Stratophase in 2009, in order to develop a PPLN business based on the new\-generation MgO doped crystals. 

 The new MgO doped PPLN offered far superior power handling relative to undoped PPLN \(up to tens of Watts compared to 100s of Milliwatts\) and lower temperature device operation. Critically, Hanna and Shepherd played key roles in demonstrating the performance of the new MgO:PPLN material, including the improved power handling \(24 watt pump\) \[ **3.2**\], green pumping \[ **3.3**\] and visible pump operation, as well as making steps in showing that fibre lasers, including Thulium doping, could be used as a pump source for PPLN devices with high efficiency \[ **3.4**\]. This work was funded through multiple grants, for example, \[ **G1**\]. Demonstrating devices performance in MgO:PPLN material is crucial for Covesion to prove technical capabilities of the products. 

 Since Covesion’s formation, UoS researchers have pioneered a new approach to making optical waveguide devices in PPLN, utilising a combination of zinc diffusion and physical machining. The waveguide format in PPLN provides the capability of tightly focusing a laser beam, significantly boosting the efficiency of the wavelength conversion while maintaining a very high level of power handling. Research under the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme \[ **G2**, **G3**\] investigated the optimum dicing processes \(a form of mechanical sawing used in photonics\) required to achieve ultra\-smooth surfaces for the zinc\-diffused waveguide structures in order to optimise frequency conversion and eliminate the need for time consuming and costly lapping and polishing 

 A patent for the waveguide fabrication method, of which Berry is an inventor, was filed \[ **3.5**\] and licensed to Covesion, allowing the company to launch, in June 2019, a new commercial range of PPLN waveguides that provide highly efficient and cost\-effective frequency conversion. Research by Tropper, Apostolopoulos and Berry was instrumental in testing the waveguide devices \[ **3.6**\]. Customers are able to specify wavelengths that are not commercially available elsewhere. The team went on to demonstrate world record efficiencies and power handling for waveguides in lasers used to cool atoms close to absolute zero so they can be used as ultra\-sensitive gravity sensors for earth systems monitoring, including changes in polar ice mass, ocean current and sea level – see later Innovate Projects \[ **5.5**\]

###  4. Details of the impact 

 University of Southampton research underpinned the formation of spin out company Covesion and, over the REF 2021 impact period, has been integral to both the optimisation of the company’s MgO PPLN crystals and the creation of new PPLN products. Covesion offers volume manufacture of bespoke crystals for Original Equipment Manufacturer systems; its PPLN devices allow customers to reach wavelengths that cannot be achieved with conventional solid state or diode lasers. The company’s customers include world\-leading companies and prestigious research institutes spanning the areas of defence, communications, laser manufacturing and medicine. Specific applications include: microscopy imaging, laser\-based missile countermeasure systems, trace gas detection, LIDAR, precision navigation systems, seabed surveying, environmental monitoring and remote sensing. 

 There are three strands to the economic impact arising from the underpinning research: direct impact on Covesion’s commercial growth over the impact period; wider economic impact generated through sales, by Covesion customers, of systems reliant on Covesion’s PPLN devices; and commercial income unlocked for UK industry through the award of Innovate UK programmes that revolve around Covesion’s technology. 

 **Economic impact via the commercial growth of a university spinout company** 

 UoS research underpins Covesion’s two main products: MgO PPLN crystals and MgO PPLN packaged waveguides. These patented, market\-leading technologies have resulted in Covesion securing customers that include major corporations \[text removed for publication\], government labs \(e.g. NASA, US Naval Observatory, Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology\) and the majority of the world’s leading universities \(e.g. Harvard, Stanford, Caltech\) \[ **5.1**, **5.2**\]. 

 Over the impact period, Covesion has almost tripled its annual turnover \[text removed for publication\]; 95% of sales constituted overseas exports, benefitting the UK economy \[ **5.2**, **5.3**\]. The new PPLN waveguide devices launched in June 2019 accounted for 25% of commercial income as of December 2020; this is expected to rise to more than 50% by 2023 \[ **5.2**\]. The company has more than doubled its workforce from 5 to 11 people, creating six high\-skilled roles \[ **5.2**\]. It has been able to plan strategically for annual growth of 30% for the period 2021\-2024. This is demonstrated through its formal \[text removed for publication\] commitment, made in December 2020, to move to a larger high\-value manufacturing facility at Adanac Park, Southampton to accommodate planned growth \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **Economic impact via the sale of laser systems reliant on Covesion products** 

 Global sales of laser and quantum technology systems have been enabled specifically through the incorporation of Covesion PPLN crystals. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Companies choose Covesion materials for a set of technical reasons and a range of commercial reasons that provide their OEM systems with a competitive advantage \[ **5.2**\]. The former includes high laser damage thresholds \(>500kW/cm2 for 2000 hours\), nonlinearity of 16pm/V, dimension control \(\+/\- 50 microns\) and poling fidelity – all of which lead to reliable operation within design tolerances. The latter reasons for choosing to purchase from Covesion includes price, reliability of supply, delivery time, quality control and after\-sales technical support \[ **5.2**\]. Many of these features originate directly from ORC research into poling technology \(specifically the development of MgO:PPLN poling\), which provides very high poling fidelity, reliable yield \(which is important to meet tight delivery schedules\) and optimum nonlinearity \[ **5.2**\]. Covesion’s large volume manufacturing capabilities are key to offering its customers a significant price advantage \[ **5.2**\]. When customers purchase crystals, they place orders via tenders or large call\-off orders, which allows Covesion to reduce the prices of their crystals by increasing manufacturing volumes. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Covesion sells its products into laser systems that retail for anywhere between 40 and 1,000 times the value of the Covesion product; it is common for a pulsed laser system to sell for at least GBP100,000 \[ **5.2**\]. \[text removed for publication\] 

 Taking the above details into account, Covesion can produce a quantitative estimate of the global economic impact arising from OEM product sales that <ins>rely upon</ins> the nonlinear properties of the company’s PPLN crystals and waveguides: an average of GBP60,000,000 per year \(cumulatively, GBP420,000,000\) over the impact period. Covesion’s CEO wrote \[ **5.2**\]: ‘ *Based on our direct sales figures and what we know of the retail value of the laser systems in which our products form an integral part, we can provide a confident, yet conservative, economic impact estimate of GBP60m per year as an average over the impact period. This relates to the sale of systems that would otherwise not be possible without our devices*.’ There is also a wider societal impact in that anti\-missile laser systems protect commercial, military and peace\-keeping aircraft from attack. 

 **Economic impact via direct income to UK industry through the UK Government National Quantum Technology Programme** 

 In 2014, the UK Government announced its intention to develop a GBP1bn industry based on the commercialisation of quantum technologies. The UK National Quantum Technologies Programme was further expanded in 2018 when the Government announced it was one of 15 key areas for the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. UoS research into the development of PPLN waveguides \[ **P2**, **3.3**\- **3.6**\] has been a key enabling element of several Innovate UK grants that have provided direct income to not only Covesion but multiple UK companies, and have supported the development of the UK’s sovereign capability in this area \[ **5.2**, **5.5**\]. 

 Covesion has been awarded over GBP1,000,000 in direct income from five Innovate UK projects over the impact period \[ **5.5**\]. These include the Cold Atoms Space Payload \(CASPA\) project, which sought to develop a small satellite payload to generate cold atoms in space; it was highlighted by the Government as one of three case studies in its investment announcement in 2018 \[ **5.6**\]. UoS and Covesion PPLN waveguide technology unlocked income for a range of UK companies or subsidiaries, many of which are start\-ups and SMEs, from three Innovate UK projects: CASPA; QT Assemble, which is increasing the reliability and reducing the size and cost of laser components and systems; and MIRUS, which aims to develop and deliver a mid\-infrared single\-photon detector demonstrator system \(for LIDAR and telecommunications systems\) \[ **5.5**\]. These have resulted in the awarding of GBP5,480,000 in direct income for companies that include BAE Systems, Edinburgh start\-up Photon Force Limited, University of Sheffield spinout AegiQ and Newcastle\-based naontechnology firm Inex \[ **5.5**\]. UoS and Covesion technology was integral to the award of these projects \[ **5.2**, **5.7**\]. For example, in QT Assemble, Covesion’s PPLN waveguide technology is fundamental to the delivery of all the project’s technical work packages \[ **5.7**\]. As further evidence of the research supporting the UK’s sovereign capability, the work of Covesion is cited twice in DSTL’s 2020 report: *Quantum Information Processing Landscape 2020: Prospects for UK Defence and Security* \[ **5.8**\]. The report’s purpose was to encourage and guide MOD investment in quantum technologies.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Seminal work carried out at Oxford Brookes University, to create a global cue video processing algorithm that identifies the most significant regions of an image, has laid the foundation for development of a significant product upgrade for a major phone handset manufacturer. Huawei has deployed this technology as a ‘selfie’ app that is built into tens of millions of Huawei smartphones sold globally. Oxford Brookes University’s technical expertise on computer vision and action recognition has also been instrumental in producing the algorithms that have been selected for use in other popular Huawei smart devices. In addition, the pioneering technology has enabled Sportlight, a sports analytics start\-up, to create state of the art intelligence tools for professional sports teams, including English Premier League football clubs.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Computer Vision Research Group at Oxford Brookes University, which was founded in 2005 by Professor Philip Torr, has made many outstanding contributions to the field, especially in scene understanding within images. One of these contributions arose from an EPSRC funded project ‘Scene Understanding Using New Global Energy Models’ \(EP/I001107/1, GBP439,228, 2011\-2013\) in which the Global Cue \(GC\) method was developed for automatically detecting which areas of an image are foreground and which are background. The foreground is often the most visually salient region of an image, representing the person or object that is the primary subject of a photograph. 

 This work was carried out by Ming\-Ming Cheng. During his 17 months at Oxford Brookes University, Cheng, working with Torr and Crook, substantially revised his original GC method, which had been developed during his doctoral research at Tsinghua University, China. This improved its efficiency so that it could be applied to scene understanding in video sequences. The GC method collects samples from across the image based on their appearance, grouping similar samples together that are close to each other in the image. This approach avoids the erroneous hard boundaries often created with the super pixel approach **\[R1\]**. 

 This implementation of the GC method was compared experimentally with 18 alternative algorithms on the largest publicly available dataset of images \(1000 images\) with pixel accurate ‘ground truth’ annotations **\[R2\]**. The experiment showed that the GC method’s salient object region detection results were 25% better than the previous best results produced by alternative methods **\[R1\]**. Fig 1 below shows a visual comparison of GC with some of the alternative methods. The results also demonstrate that the refined GC method out\-performs the alternative algorithms in terms of processing speed. 



 In 2012, the Computer Vision Group was re\-named the Visual Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and, under Professor Fabio Cuzzolin, the group has achieved a prominent position in the field of human action recognition from videos. This work received funding from an EPSRC First Grant on ‘Tensorial modeling of dynamical systems for gait and activity recognition’ \(EP/I018719/1, GBP98,364, 2011\-2014\). Work carried out under this funding included a method for detecting actions in videos by representing them as graphs of parts **\[R3\]**. In 2016 the Visual AI Lab was among the first in the world to employ deep neural networks for detecting actions performed by people in videos, represented as ‘action tubes’ as illustrated below, where, frame by frame the actions \(in this case, cycling\) are identified and tracked over time. 

 The approach exploits an original dynamic programming algorithm which form ‘tubes’ linking rectangular areas of a continuous series of frames together to form ‘action tubes’ in real time and which can anticipate future events **\[R4\]**. 



 In 2017, the team was the first to propose a deep\-learning\-based approach for detecting multiple events in real time in a streaming video **\[R5\]**. The method was further developed into the first causal 3D CNN architecture \(Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network\), achieving state\-of\-the\-art performance in action recognition **\[R6\]**. The accuracy of this detection technique was recognised with 2nd place awards at in the action detection challenges at both the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition \(CVPR\) Charades \( [<ins>http://vuchallenge.org/charades.html</ins>](http://vuchallenge.org/charades.html)\) and ActivityNet \( [<ins>http://activity\-net.org/challenges/2016/program.html\#leaderboard</ins>](http://activity-net.org/challenges/2016/program.html)\). These activities challenge computer vision groups from around the world to compete on a task.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The world leading research on artificial intelligence for computer vision and action recognition at Oxford Brookes University has led to innovative new products for both a major existing international company and a start\-up company. 

 **Artificial Intelligence for saliency detection and action recognition in Huawei mobile phone cameras** 

 The research that Cheng completed whilst at Oxford Brookes University resulted in clear evidence that the GC method for saliency detection was capable of producing state\-of\-the\-art image analysis, with substantial commercial potential. It laid the foundation for the development of a saliency detection algorithm that has now been deployed in tens of millions of Huawei mobile phones, from the Mate 10 model onwards. 

 In 2014 Cheng returned to China to take up an academic position at Nankai University, where he continued to work on the GC method, developing a ‘deep\-learning’ implementation of it, in which the global and local cues were learned rather than hand crafted. This implementation was published in a top\-ranking international conference \( *IEEE CVPR 2017*\). Huawei recognised that this ‘deep\-learning’ implementation of the GC method had clear application potential in their product line and Nankai University and Huawei jointly applied for a national invention patent for this technology **\[S1\]**. In 2017 Cheng and his research group won an award for their outstanding collaboration with Huawei **\[S2\]**. 

 Huawei used the technology to develop a selfie app which featured in their flagship mobile phones \(Mate 10 series onwards\), and which provided support for the smart camera effect of Huawei products. This effect is used to support auto\-adjustment modes for ‘selfies’, to automatically improve portrait photographs. The smart camera then adjusts the contrast settings to optimise the sharpness of the image to produce a high quality self\-portrait. This is a significant selling point for Huawei handsets because the ability to take high quality self\-portrait images is a highly desirable feature for many phone users. This saliency feature was presented in an online demonstration at the MATE 10 product launch show in March 2018 **\[S3\]**   and described in the marketing brochure for the Y6 phone in 2018 **\[S4\].** The AI features in this phone received favourable reviews **\[S5\]**. It was reported that 17,000,000 Mate 10 phones, which included this technology, were sold in the first year after the launch in October 2017 **\[S6\]**. The technology was also included in the Mate 20 phone which sold 10,000,000 units in the first year after its launch in October 2018 **\[S7\]**. 

 Cuzzolin is a consultant at Huawei’s Vancouver IC Lab, which occupies 20% of his time. Through this consultancy, the Visual AI Lab’s research on deep learning for human behaviour analysis has informed numerous projects. Details are commercially sensitive, but a number of computer vision algorithms developed there, under Cuzzolin’s overall technical consultancy, have been selected to be installed in high\-end smartphones, such as the Mate 20 Pro and the P20 Pro, based on Huawei’s Kirin 970 and 980 chipsets. Vancouver IC Lab’s Director confirms that there are three projects “adopted, or in process to be integrated into the products” **\[S8i\]**. He also recognises that Cuzzolin’s technical expertise on computer vision and action recognition “through the consultancy has had a significant impact, and \[has\] been instrumental in producing the algorithms that can be adopted into smart devices” **\[S8ii\]**. Cuzzolin has also had impact on the researchers in the Huawei team. The Director states, “Your comments and feedback for their project help them finish their projects, as well the growth along their career path” **\[S8ii\]**. 

 **Artificial Intelligence for action recognition applied to performance analysis and sports analytics.** 

 A Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Createc Technologies \(GBP190,000, 2019\-2021\) was launched in April 2019 to use action recognition technologies for monitoring players’ physical movements on the football pitch. CEO of Sportlight \(a business within Createc, which uses new technology to provide advanced intelligence for sports teams\), states that the action recognition technology has “helped set Sportlight’s products apart from current legacy ones \(based on GPS or optical tracking\)”. He confirms that, “at least 3 recent Premier League connections were facilitated by our KTP work” and funding for development has been received from one premier league club **\[S9i\]**. The novelty provided by this technology has also helped to secure a new round of funding for Sportlight. The CEO states: “While the core product features are important for our key contacts \(sports scientists and performance experts at elite football clubs\), the potential ‘new’ insights, inspired by Fabio Cuzolin's research work on action recognition, allow us to work with more departments within clubs \(physio/medical team, tactical analysts, coaches…\) and also with more senior strategic decision makers \(Director of Insights, Head of Research, Head of Analytics\).” **\[S9ii\]**. The ability to analyse the cause of injuries in addition to tracking player performance is of considerable interest to football clubs. 

 In summary, the new technologies developed at Oxford Brookes University have contributed to the introduction of Huawei’s world leading series of Mate 10 and 20 mobile phones, which has underpinned Huawei’s rise to become the world’s number one phone manufacturer since April 2020. Oxford Brookes University’s technologies have also enabled Createc to expand its start\-up business and excite the interest of top football clubs.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This authoring and application of new software, systems and tools for real\-time electronics within interactive music has challenged preconceptions of electronic music, demonstrating new means for accessibility to audiences in Europe, the Americas, and Australia. Musicians within these new interactive systems have benefited by exploring extensions to their instruments, furthering their technique within performance. Research into the expressive potential of technology has driven developments of new commercial products taken up by others in and beyond the real\-time electronic music making community, providing pathways to creativity and musicianship beyond academic contexts. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Fischman, Spasov and Uduman’s combined body of research in search of new audio processing systems for real\-time electronic compositions \(a compositional approach taking live audio from musicians via a microphone/sensor and subjecting it to computer processing to provide simultaneous changes to the sounding output\) has yielded a variety of products, systems, tools, interfaces and compositions that retain musicality, expressivity and natural bodily gesture as part of the compositional process. Prioritising these qualities in real\-time situations is distinctive, departing from tape/fixed media, abstract or algorithmic approaches. 

 Experimental electronic works often garner views of 'alienation’ \(Wolf, 2013 and Norman,1995\) ‘inaccessibility’ \(Stead, 2016\), ‘coldness’ or ‘sterility’ \(Drever, 2005\), especially from new or non\-academic audiences. By foregrounding human musical expression over visible technologic complexity, the researchers have facilitated greater accessibility and appreciation for compositions within the real\-time electronics genre. A common goal of crafting expressiveness unencumbered by technological obtrusiveness has guided the researchers’ outputs. Insights fall into two categories: 

-  By creating new software and systems that are responsive to live musician audio input the research shows that technology can adapt to composers’ score writing approaches and inherent musical language, not interrupting, overshadowing or dictating the compositional process. **\[3.1\] \[3.3\], \[3.4\], \[3.5\], \[3.6\]** 

-  Natural idiomatic playing techniques and/or movements from musicians/participants can be ‘mapped’ \(a term describing how a performer’s movements and natural playing techniques can be used to control changes to the electronics/sounding output\) onto real\-time processing, achieving highly expressive results. Sophistication of mapping, while simplifying user/musician interfaces, encourages participation/access since there is a general ‘acceptance’ of human agency in producing and controlling the sound emitted. **\[3.4\], \[3.5\], \[3.6\]** 

 Spasov’s development of 9 Max/MSP software externals **\[3.3\]** implemented in widely performed compositions demonstrates complex programming that is ‘easily accessible’ \(Spasov, 2015\). Patterns derived from chaos theory’s mathematical equations were packaged into viable, open\-access tools **\[3.3\]** whereby users interact via on\-screen visual ‘pattern\-generating’ features for controlling sound processing in real\-time electronics. 

  

 Fischman’s Manual Expressive System \(MAES\) software enables music creation and performance using natural hand actions, preserving links between causality of gestures and everyday experience of the world, while yielding sound that is a believable result of the performer’s movements. Combining glove gaming technology with new software, gestures are made programmable through mapping of hand motion and finger bends, enabling performers/users to realise expressive content with simple hand gestures **\[3.2\]**. MAES is useable by individuals without formal musical training. The mappings associated with simple hand gestures can be sophisticated because complexity is subsumed within the technology. MAES features in **3.6.** 

  

 *Idiosyncrasies* **\[3.4\]** and *Out of the darkness that envelops* **\[3.5\],** both for contrabass clarinet and electronics, investigated composition methods utilising music expression data obtained from performers’ changes to air pressure while they play wind instruments. Innovative mapping of air pressure sensor data onto real\-time sound transformation is observable in the music. 

 Fischman’s *Clouds* software **\[3.1\]** was devised as a real\-time asynchronous granular synthesis tool in which parameters are handled graphically for distribution across multi\-channel loudspeaker arrays.

 **Uptake of software and influencing development of new commercial products** 

 Research has developed into new open\-access software for real\-time composition including Clouds **\[3.1\],** Attractors **\[3.3\],** and MAES **\[3.2\]**. **3.1** has been used internationally, with end users describing it as ‘simply remarkable...an incredible tool for granular sound design and performance’ and ‘a good companion’ **\(5.1\). 3.1** was used to create new music: *2 lukas para flauta y electrónica* and *Música Inmobiliaria* **\(5.2\)**. **3.1** was used within workshops for students \(Orson Welles Institute, Peru, 2016\) **\(5.1\)**, and **3.2** featured in the Summer Conservatory Program \(Texas, 2017\) **\(5.1\).** **3.3** has inspired other software developments including new code \(using the population growth equation known as ‘bakers map’\) created by a software developer **\(5.4\).** 

 Uduman and Spasov influenced the development of a new commercial product known as the SABRE \(Sensor Augmented Bass Clarinet Research\) device, led by the Institute for Computer Music and Sound Technology \(Zurich\). The device captures air pressure data produced by wind musicians, generating numerical data for mapping. Spasov and Uduman fed into the design and testing from 2010, suggesting an idiomatic approach enabling performers to feel as comfortable performing live electronic compositions as they would any other instrument\-only work. In 2018 they were commissioned to produce new music **\(3.4** and **3.5\),** providing proof of concept, and received critical acclaim **\(5.5\).** The performer noted that **3.4** and **3.5** ‘demonstrated the SABRE Multi Sensor’s creative potentials in the best way’ **\(5.6\).** The SABRE project leader noted the researchers’ role in having ‘successfully tested and applied SABRE’s potential in an original way. Their work with SABRE has made a significant influence on the way we will be developing the SABRE device’ **\(5.6\).** Since 2018 40 SABRE devices have been sold **\(5.7, 5.5\).** A SABRE customer stated, ‘The device …enhances my performative expression of real\-time electronics …providing me with new and exciting musical possibilities.’ She observed that the device ‘steers the conversation between composers and performers to a common topic, discussing the possibilities for performative and compositional expression, which …is key to advancing the field’ **\(5.8\).** 

 **Influencing musicians’ understanding of real\-time electronics** 

 Through playing these pieces, musicians have gained greater understanding of the capabilities of real\-time electronics without compromising musicality. The performer of **3.4** and **3.5** said ‘the entire project has already helped me improve my contrabass and bass clarinet extended performance techniques and expanded the range of timbres I can produce in the various registers of the instruments’ **\(5.6\).** Further clarinettists have praised the application of the SABRE device within **3.4** and **3.5:** ‘the way the interaction between the electronics and the instruments worked has changed the way I will be approaching the performance of contemporary music in the future’. **3.4** and **3.5** have “raised my interest to broaden my bass clarinet repertoire’ \( **5.8\)**, while others have commended the successful blend of ‘natural musicality and performative expression with innovative real\-time electronics’ **\(5.8\).** NoiseFloor Festival emphasised that **3.4** and **3.5** represent ‘valuable and unique additions to the limited repertoire for Contrabass Clarinet’ **\(5.9\).** 

 **Influencing audience perceptions of real\-time electronics** 

 Compositions from the research group have been performed on an extensive scale. Between August 2013 and December 2020, 50 performances have taken place in 10 countries **\(5.9\).** Audience responses to these performances demonstrate increased accessibility to real\-time electronics. A musician attending a performance of **3.4** and **3.5** observed that the composers’ approach ‘makes live electronics much more accessible’ **\(5.8\).** An audience member for **3.4** and **3.5** reflected on the experience: ‘I discovered the sound of two wonderful instruments... I was transported into unknown musical worlds by the combination of these strange instruments and the electronic and digital audio processing’. **\(5.10\)** Reviewers have noted the importance of *Into the Depths* \(CD publication featuring **3.4** and **3.5,** 2020\) as a ‘compilation first’ **\(5.5\)** for the contrabass clarinet and “paramount in leading the way for future contrabass clarinettists, the establishment of new techniques and blends between instrument and technology’ **\(5.5\).** 

 The researchers have increased accessibility of the genre for young people via outreach resources. **3.4** was used as comparative listening to illuminate real\-time electronics for A Level Music students studying Saariaho’s *Petals* for cello and live electronics \(Edexcel set works list\). Worksheet and video resources were distributed to approximately 160 students from 14 schools during lockdown \(March 2020\) to assist their learning. One teacher stated: ‘The resources have excited and engaged the students so much …finding new ways to make sound on their respective instruments and also process that sound electronically.’ **\(5.3\).**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 High\-temperature transducers \(HT transducers\) developed by Brunel academics were used to detect a fully penetrating crack \(text removed for publication\) in a boiler at Heysham 1 nuclear plant operated by EDF Energy in July 2014, leading to the immediate closure of both Heysham 1 and its sister station Hartlepool. These plants were able to resume their full operation quickly, within 5 to 6 months, because EDF installed the HT transducers on the boiler spines in 8 systems in each of the 4 stations \(in total 32 systems\) that enable early detection of aging pipes through continuous monitoring. \(text removed for publication\) In\-situ monitoring by HT transducers allows a proactive strategy for managing ageing plants, extending their operating lifetime and significantly reducing the potential for unscheduled outages through a targeted maintenance and repair. Consequently, both nuclear plants, originally scheduled to close in 2019, will continue to operate for another 5 years, until 2024, contributing to sustaining the nuclear energy supply in the UK. Given that EDF provides 25% of the total nuclear generating capacity of the UK, an unplanned outage or a failure to detect faults could have led to a national disaster.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 
Brunel has been collaborating with The Welding Institute \(TWI\) and other industrial partners for over a decade to develop technologies for non\-destructive testing of major infrastructure.  It currently holds a grant portfolio of over GBP10,000,000. 

 To achieve reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, improved efficiency and availability, nuclear power plants are operating at harsher conditions \(such as high process\-temperature and pressures\) and cyclic duty schedules. These conditions have an adverse effect on the structural integrity of key components and increase their risk of critical failure. In particular, high temperature pipework can suffer from accelerated and severe creep\-fatigue damage, which can lead to catastrophic failures. The Ultrasonic Guided Wave \(UGW\) technique has been widely used for the routine inspection of pipework in power plants to manage and minimise outage, but it can be both costly and time consuming. 

 To enable in\-service monitoring of pipelines, Brunel and TWI realised that both signal processing \(software\) and high temperature \(HT\) ultrasonic transducers \(hardware\) needed to be enhanced. The research was led by Professors Gan and Balachandran at Brunel who worked closely with TWI. Using numerical modelling and experimental investigations, Professor Balachandran has identified appropriate wave modes and excitation/reception conditions needed to inspect different sections of rails. \[Ref 1\] 

 In 2011, Brunel was awarded an EU\-funded R&D Project, Hotscan which developed a long\-range ultrasonic system with high temperature capability for continuous in\-service inspection and structural health monitoring of high\-temperature pipes in power generation plants and refineries. The HT transducers then\-available could only operate up to temperatures of around 150°C. 

 The initial research evaluated the performance of existing piezoelectric materials at high temperatures and established the methodology to characterise piezoelectric materials at up to 350°C. \[Ref 2\] 

 Subsequently, the methodology was enhanced to enable the testing of the characteristics of the piezoelectric materials for ultrasonic guided wave at a temperature of up to 600°C \[Ref 3\]. 

 Using this research finding in 2013, Brunel academics in collaboration with colleagues at TWI developed a number of HT transducers with enhanced temperature capabilities \(continuous operation at a target temperature of up to 580°C\) for a UGW monitoring system for steam lines. This enabled continuous in\-service structural health monitoring of HT pipes and early detection of defects, therefore preventing failures.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Brunel researchers’ development of the HT transducers that could endure continuous operation at high temperatures of up to 200°C enabled the engineers to detect the fully penetrating crack \(text removed for publication\) in a boiler operated by EDF Energy. \[E2 p9\] In July 2014, the detection of the crack on a boiler spine at Heysham 1 caused EDF to shut down immediately, Heysham 1 and its sister station, Hartlepool power station, because they both share the same design specifications. Heysham is the only site in the UK to have 2 operating nuclear power stations. Given that EDF manages and operates power stations generating 25% of the total nuclear generating capacity of the UK, the power outages by EDF 

 Energy led the National Grid to ‘fast\-forward an emergency plan’ to secure more electricity in case of a possible shortfall. \[E7\] 

 Brunel researchers’ guided wave technology was used to inspect all the boilers associated with the 2 nuclear reactors at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool. In order to allow the power stations to begin operating again, they then installed HT transducers \(Figure – the ‘ring’\) on the boiler spines in 8 systems in each of the 4 stations operated by EDF Energy \(in total 32 systems\), which enable early detection of aging pipes by sending signals to the boiler. \[E1\] 

 With the permanent installation of HT transducers with 100% volume inspection coverage, both sites were able to quickly return to service by late 2014 and early 2015, causing little to no adverse impact to the national energy supply in the UK. 

 \(Text removed for publication\) 

 Since then, Brunel researchers have been supporting the TWI team in the analysis and interpretation of the data from the systems. 

 <ins> **Safety Measures – Preparing for the Future**</ins> 

 This incident highlights the challenges that Britain is already facing – a power capacity crunch due to ageing nuclear and coal plants. Many of our reactors were built in the 1980s and are approaching the end of their service life. Both Heysham 1 and Hartlepool were commissioned in 1983 and were due to come out of service in 2019. \[E8\] 

 The importance of regular monitoring and early detection of faults cannot be underestimated – the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan clearly demonstrated the potential damage that a critical failure at a nuclear power plant can cause. 

 Significant parts of piping systems are partly or entirely inaccessible to non\-destructive inspection techniques. Therefore, installing the HT transducers in fixed positions allows EDF to monitor and collect repeatable results and build a robust model to estimate the operational resilience of nuclear plants. Consequently, EDF have developed a proactive strategy for managing ageing plants, extending their operating lifetime and significantly reducing the potential for unscheduled outages. This is achieved by accurately monitoring their condition and then strategically intervening with a targeted maintenance and repair regime. EDF Energy has extended the scheduled closure dates for Heysham 1 and Hartlepool by 5 years from 2019 to 2024.

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Professor Meyer\-Sahling’s research influenced civil service reform and management in the Western Balkans, transforming the way public administration operates and helping countries to progress on their path to EU accession. His collaboration with international organisations, in particular, the Regional School of Public Administration \(ReSPA\) and OECD\-SIGMA delivered new evidence and actionable recommendations. The research became instrumental \(1\) for the change of civil service laws, especially merit recruitment policies in three countries \(Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro\), \(2\) the adoption of capacity\-building measures to improve the quality of implementing recruitment polices in all six Western Balkan countries, and \(3\) the design and application of novel assessment methodologies and regional cooperation initiatives for the diffusion of best practices by international organisations and civil society organisations to help Western Balkan countries advance towards EU accession. 
","
# 1.  Underpinning research 

 Professor Meyer\-Sahling is an internationally\-leading expert in the study of civil service reform and management in post\-communist Europe, including the Western Balkans \(Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia\). 

 The prime objective of civil service reform in the Western Balkans is the establishment of merit recruitment to overcome legacies of party patronage and nepotism in public personnel management. Merit recruitment is the hallmark of professional civil services. It is associated with economic development and helps prevent corruption in the public sector. 

 Recognising these benefits, the European Union \(EU\) made civil service professionalisation a condition for accession and provides support and assessments of reform progress. Meyer\-Sahling conducted research in collaboration with international organisations to assess reforms in accordance with EU conditions and develop strategies to professionalise civil services. 

 **Assessing civil service professionalisation and its consequences** 

 Meyer\-Sahling conducted surveys of civil servants, human resources \(HR\) managers and external observers to measure the extent to which civil services in the region are successfully professionalising. Research funded by OECD\-SIGMA \(Support for the Improvement of Governance and Management, a joint initiative of the OECD and the EU\) **\[P1\]** in 2010/11 and ReSPA \(Regional School of Public Administration\) **\[P2\]** in 2015 showed that Western Balkan governments had continuously invested in civil service reforms. However, institutional frameworks often remained incomplete and implementation patchy. As a consequence, politicisation, party patronage and nepotism remained widespread in public administration. 

 In the context of a British Academy/DFID funded project on the consequences of civil service management, Meyer\-Sahling – together with Professor Christian Schuster \(UCL\) and Doctor Kim Sass Mikkelsen \(Roskilde\) – demonstrated that politicised and nepotistic recruitment practices are associated with less work motivation, less public service motivation and more corruption in the public sector workforce **\[P3\]**. The findings qualified Meyer\-Sahling’s earlier research on civil service politicisation and corruption **\[P4\]**, thereby placing a premium on identifying strategies that help curb politicisation and nepotism in civil service recruitment. Meyer\-Sahling developed three strategies that focus on: 

1.  **Getting institutional designs right** 

 Meyer\-Sahling’s research showed that written examinations and public advertisement of job vacancies are associated with less politicisation and less nepotism in recruitment and, by implication, better performance and less corruption in the civil service **\[P3\]**. Based on robust evidence, he gave actionable recommendations to Western Balkan governments on how to best design merit recruitment procedures. 

1.  **Getting implementation capacity right** 

 The research conducted with ReSPA demonstrated how digital technology increased the efficiency, consistency, transparency and user\-friendliness of recruitment policies **\[P2\]**. It further emphasised the need to develop professional competencies of key agents such as the staff of central civil service agencies, personnel units and senior civil servants across public administration by, for instance, training members of selection commissions **\[P2\]**. The recommended capacity\-building measures improved the quality of implementing merit recruitment policies. 

1.  **Getting international support right 

 Meyer\-Sahling’s earlier OECD\-SIGMA funded research on EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe questioned the effectiveness of EU conditionality in achieving sustainable results after accession **\[P5\]**. Instead, he stressed the importance of complementing EU conditionality with lesson\-drawing activities and initiatives to enable policy learning by key agents **\[P6\]**. Such activities, he recommended, are best coordinated by organisations such as ReSPA, OECD\-SIGMA and regional and local networks of civil society organisations whose mission it is to promote regional cooperation in the field of public administration reform, build local ownership by stakeholders in governments, and diffuse best practices for EU accession across the Western Balkans.

# 1.  Details of the impact 

 Professor Meyer\-Sahling’s research generated new evidence that became instrumental for the improvement of civil service management, in particular, merit recruitment policies and practices, in the Western Balkans. The changes that directly resulted from his research transformed the way public administration works, helping Western Balkan countries to advance on their path to EU accession. 

1.  **Change of civil service laws, in particular, recruitment policies and practices, helping reduce civil service politicisation and advance towards EU accession** 

 In 2015, Meyer\-Sahling completed a ReSPA Regional Study on merit recruitment in the Western Balkans **\[P2\]**. The study concluded with 61 actionable recommendations on how to improve institutional frameworks and the capacity to implement recruitment policies for follow up by national governments. It was translated into three foreign languages \(Albanian, Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian, Macedonian\) and presented by Meyer\-Sahling to decision\-makers in national capitals at workshops organised by ministries of public administration and civil service agencies. By 2018, more than **60% of the recommendations were adopted** by the six Western Balkan countries **\[A, B\]**. Nearly 70% of the adopted recommendations were fully implemented. The uptake varied from 18% in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 85% in Albania and Montenegro **\[C\]**. Most notably, in Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro, reform working parties used Meyer\-Sahling’s Regional Study **\[P2\]** as guidance to change civil service laws with the aim of strengthening merit recruitment policy and practices. 

 The new/amended civil service laws are in force in all three countries. A survey commissioned by ReSPA identified a **positive trend towards professionalisation of civil service recruitment practices** **and a reduction in civil service politicisation** in Serbia and Montenegro **\[C\]**. The positive impacts of the changes were ‘ *recognised in the EU Progress Reports that are published annually by the European Commission and has **helped these countries to advance on their path towards EU accession**’ **\[D\]**. 

 The impacts were achieved in **Serbia** after Meyer\-Sahling’s Regional Study **\[P2\]** was used by the ‘Special Working Group’ chaired by the Minister of Public Administration and Local Self\-Government in 2017 and 2018 to prepare an amendment of the Law on Civil Servants. ‘ *The Special Working Group adopted more than 70% of the recommendations put forward by Professor Meyer\-Sahling*’ **\[E\]**. The amendment was adopted by Parliament in December 2018 and has been implemented since January 2019. The incorporation of Meyer\-Sahling’s recommendations **\[P2\]** led in **Serbia** to the ‘ **introduction of competency\-based examinations \[…\]**. These written entry examinations are compulsory for all civil servants. Since the beginning of 2019, the new examination method has been applied to more than 600 advertised positions and more than 2000 candidates have sat the competency\-based exam administered by the Human Resources Management Service*’. Thanks to the new examination procedure, selection commissions are able to ‘ *pick candidates that are most qualified for the positions in government*’. Moreover, the changes ‘ *helped the Government of Serbia to progress on the road to EU accession and to meet its strategic objective of becoming an EU member in the future*’ **\[E\].** 

 In **Kosovo,** Meyer\-Sahling’s studies **\[P2, 3\]** directly ‘ *informed the official Working Group during the preparation of the Law on Public Officials between May 2017 and October 2018*’ **\[F\]**. The Law was passed by Parliament in January 2019 and has been in force since July 2020. The most significant change resulting from his recommendations was ‘ *the **revision of the civil service recruitment procedure to strengthen the merit principle**’ **\[F\]**. The ‘ *European Commission Staff Working Document Kosovo\* 2020 Report emphasizes that “the legal framework for the merit\-based recruitment \[…\] improved with the adoption of the Law on Public Officials \[…\]”. The positive evaluation of the civil service provides significant help for the Government of Kosovo to meet the conditions for accession to the European Union’* **\[F\]**. 

 In **Montenegro**, his Regional Study **\[P2\]** influenced the ‘Working Group’ that designed a new Law on Civil Servants and State Employees. The Working Group included the Ministry of Interior, Human Resources Management Authority, Ministries of Finance and of Justice. It *‘took on board the recommendations that Meyer\-Sahling and his team had formulated in the ReSPA Study on Merit Recruitment*’ **\[G\]**. The Law, passed in 2017, has been in force since July 2018. The Law led to the **introduction of ‘ **a competency framework and written entry examinations for senior officials**’** and ‘ *the requirement to include external experts from academia, civil society and the wider public sector on recruitment and selection commissions*’. **\[G\]**. The European Commission arranged for an independent assessment of the institutional framework, concluding that ‘ *there has been a notable contribution to the promotion and strengthening \[of\] human resource management and the civil service system more generally and \[that\] **there is evidence of transformative effects on the way in which public administration operates**, particularly, from a human resources perspective*’ **\[G\].** 

1.  **Adoption of measures to build capacity for implementation of merit recruitment policy, improving transparency and competitiveness of recruitment processes** 

 In addition to problems of institutional design, the Meyer\-Sahling’s Regional Study **\[P2\]** innovated by proposing measures that mitigate problems of implementation. These include complex, inefficient application procedures and a lack of professional competence of human resources managers and members of selection commissions. 

 In **Serbia**, the Human Resources Management Service changed regulations in 2019 in accordance with Meyer\-Sahling’s recommendations **\[P2\]** to make the recruitment procedure ‘ *more user\-friendly and less costly for the applicants.* For instance, the new procedure requires the submission of a smaller number of certified official documents and ‘ *has allowed more qualified candidates to participate in the competitions’*. The Human Resources Management Service confirmed that the new regulation ‘ *has led a **significant increase in the number of qualified candidates** who have applied for various positions across public administration*’ **\[E\]**. 

 In **Montenegro**, the uptake of his recommendations helped ‘ *increase equal opportunities and transparency of civil service recruitment, such as \[the provision of\] information on the website, daily newspapers, Instagram, Facebook and online consultations in order to better support potential candidates in the process of recruitment*’. The changes further involved the introduction of ‘ *electronic testing of civil service candidates by the Human Resources Management Authority*’. The Human Resources Management Authority ‘ *explained that with the transparency and equal representation, we increased the quality of applicants. Now, **recruitment is much more competitive, as we get more qualified candidates with better knowledge and skills than before**’ **\[G\].** 

 Most notably, **‘ **all Western Balkan countries** **developed and implemented trainings for members of selection commissions**’ \[A\]**; one of the key recommendations of Meyer\-Sahling’s 2015 Regional Study **\[P2\]**. As a result, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 600 civil servants and experts were trained since 2018. Similarly, in Montenegro, 200 senior civil servants and 70 external experts were trained in 2019 and early 2020 to raise the skills and competences of commission members **\[G, I\]**. In Serbia **,** ‘ *the Human Resources Management Service has trained more than 600 commission members and employees in HR units*’ since 2019, which ‘ **helped increase the professional competences of commission members**’. **\[E\].** 

1.  **Development of novel methodologies and regional co\-operation initiatives to help diffuse best practices for progress towards the goal of EU membership ** 

 Following the completion of the ReSPA Regional study **\[P2\]**, Meyer\-Sahling helped develop the **current** **ReSPA Strategy \[H\]**. Based on a briefing note he prepared after a workshop he co\-led in Tirana in May 2017, ReSPA adopted a Strategy that incorporated his proposed regional activities to ‘ *improve professionalisation and depoliticization of the civil service*’. The Strategy was adopted in 2018 by the ReSPA Governing Board. The Strategy commits EUR200,000 per year for activities to professionalise civil service systems **\[H\]**. ‘ *The activities related to the improvement of merit recruitment and performance appraisal in the Western Balkans have since been successfully implemented*’ **\[A\]**. 

 A key element of the ResPA Strategy included the deployment of ‘ **mechanisms to promote regional cooperation** **and the exchange of good practices** in the area of public administration reform in the Western Balkans.* As explained by the ReSPA Director, the *‘implementation of these activities has **helped ReSPA Members to move closer towards the goal of joining the European Union in the future’.** Relevant examples are *‘financial and logistical support for the development of online tutorials and videos for applicants to civil service positions in Albania, support for the establishment of online recruitment tools in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and \[…\] support for the Human Resources Management Service in Serbia to develop strategic planning capacities of HR units in the central public administration.* **\[A\]**. 

 ReSPA also asked Meyer\-Sahling in 2019 to develop a novel self\-assessment methodology to help Western Balkan countries strengthen merit recruitment policies **\[P6\]**. ‘ **It complements the assessments conducted by OECD\-SIGMA and the European Commission to support the progress of Western Balkan countries towards EU accession**. The self\-assessment frameworks have been successfully completed by all ReSPA Members’.* **\[A, I\]** 

 In addition to the collaboration with ReSPA, Meyer\-Sahling acted as an advisor for **OECD\-SIGMA** on a project that incorporated his research **\[P1, 2, 4\]** and led to the publication of SIGMA Paper Nr 55 on *Senior Civil Service Professionalisation* in 2018 **\[J\]**. It explored strategies to overcome the politicisation of the senior civil service in Western Balkan countries. Meyer\-Sahling made a ‘ *valuable’ contribution ‘for the preparation of the conceptual framework as well as in synthesising the findings and preparing recommendations*’. 

 SIGMA Paper Nr 55 ‘ **triggered the revision of SIGMA’s Principles of Administration** insofar as the recruitment, selection and appointment of senior civil servants in EU accession and neighbourhood countries are concerned*’ **\[J\]**. The SIGMA Principles provide **authoritative guidance for nearly 20 countries** in the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe and North Africa in the context of the EU’s Instrument for Pre\-Accession Assistance and the European Neighbourhood Policy, on ‘ *how to better reconcile the principles of competence and political responsiveness when selecting senior civil servants*’ **\[K\].** At the national level, SIGMA Paper Nr 55 opened the discussion with governments to develop innovative policies to mitigate politicisation through the modernisation of senior civil service training. In Serbia, specifically, the initiative ‘ **cumulated in the adoption of a Training Programme for the Professional Development of Senior Civil Servants**. The programme is being implemented by the National Academy of Public Administration’* **\[K\]**. 

 Finally, in 2016 Meyer\-Sahling became Member of the Advisory Council of the Western Balkans Enabling Project for Civil Society Monitoring of Public Administration Reform \( **WeBER**\) thanks to his work with OECD\-SIGMA, ReSPA and DfID **\[P1, 2, 3, 5\]**. WeBER was implemented by the **Think for Europe Network \(TEN\)**, which consists of think tanks and civil society organisations in the region. Meyer\-Sahling’s ‘ *research experience subsequently influenced WeBER’s conceptual and methodological approach and significantly contributed to the overall success of the entire initiative’* **\[L\]**. His advice was instrumental for the development of the PAR Monitor: a new methodology for the measurement of public administration reform progress from the perspective of citizens and civil society. 

 The ‘ **successful implementation of the WeBER initiative has significantly strengthened the role of civil society organizations in monitoring public administration reforms in line with the requirements of the EU accession process**’. For example, the ‘ *European Commission opened channels for consulting civil society organisations within the institutionalised policy dialogue between the EU and candidate countries in the PAR area \(known as Special Groups on Public Administration Reform\)*’ **\[L\]**. The programme was relaunched in 2019 as WeBER 2.0 with a value of EUR1,450,000. Meyer\-Sahling continued in his advisory role, which involved the institutionalisation of the PAR Monitor and its expansion to the local public administration. WeBER now connects 22 organisations with national reach in Western Balkan countries and more than 130 local civil society organisations through the activities of the WeBER Platform, thus having ‘ **significantly strengthened regional cooperation among civil society organisations in the Western Balkans**’ **\[L\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Institute of Management \(IoM\) led the research in the Realising an Applied Gaming Ecosystem \(RAGE\) European H2020 project; investigating the structures, business models, value chains and component\-based production processes deployed by the applied digital games industry. Significant impact was achieved as the new component\-based production processes and models developed by the project are now embedded in the practice of commercial European games developers and the games containing the assets are accessed by learners located in in France, Portugal, Netherlands, Italy, UK, Spain and Germany. The European Commission selected the project for the prestigious EU ‘Innovation impact’ award in 2018.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The global demand for games designed with a purpose other than leisure or entertainment referred to as applied games is expected to increase over the coming years. The applied games industry in Europe is fragmented and competitively disadvantaged in relation to the more established industries of the United States and Asia. The RAGE project investigated whether the industry could learn form and adopt production and business processes and methodologies deployed by their successful leisure industry counterparts to achieve a competitive advantage. 

 The IoM led the project with other partners contributing technical and pedagogic expertise, commercial exploitation and administration. This research sought to identify good practice in the development processes and business models of the more established leisure industry that could be deployed to increase efficiency and the profitability of developers whilst improving the quality of their products. This involved extensive research in to the process and business models of the more established leisure games industry through stakeholder consultation and a comparative analysis of the established and emergent business models and value chains of both industries. The principal aim was to develop new business and process models that could serve to underpin the potential growth in demand for applied games. 

 A significant barrier to international competitiveness identified was the cost of production related to the efficacy of development processes and specifically the high cost of development. In the leisure industry the use of outsourced middleware and software components was commonplace Businesses such as Unity served demand by providing a market place of components or assets that were affordable and widely used by the industry. However, whilst these methodologies and business models were well established in the leisure industry in the applied industry they were not. These methodologies and models had not been validated and were largely untested in the applied Industry; where complex pedagogic features and functions were identified and highlighted as essential ingredients of applied games. The RAGE project undertook to establish an equivalent asset\-based market place for the applied industry in Europe. This involved the development and testing of reusable, interoperable, open source software assets by technical partners. The assets, process and business models were evaluated and tested and the provision of a platform to market these assets.  The assets were made available to the European development industry with the aim of condensing the development time to market and several pilots were undertaken with the industry as a proof of concept. The assets were rigorously tested by the developers based in the UK, France, Germany and Holland. The efficacy of the processes assets and business models was further evaluated.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>National and International Impact</ins> 

 As a result of the research; methodologies, production processes and business models developed as outputs within Work\-package 7 of the RAGE project have been widely adopted by the key beneficiaries of the research, European based applied game development studios. These developers have enjoyed improved efficiencies in production, gained insight into their competitive market and identified potential growth opportunities in applied games. Six compelling international commercial case studies, supported by testimony, refer to the corroboration of Impact 3,4,5,6,7,8, are provided as supporting evidence of the impact of the project on their internal development processes and business efficiencies. These case studies testimonies include from the United Kingdom Playgen and Gameware, from France BIP Media and from Germany Nurogames. The adoption of processes and asset\-based production methodologies and business models have resulted in achieving significant development cost savings in research, development and production by the businesses concerned thereby improving their global competitive advantage. 

 The impact of the project outputs has extended beyond that of  beneficiaries to research and development activities supported by the EU involving major international corporations. One of the highest profile of projects utilising the RAGE outputs is the “Jenner” applied game  [http://shura.shu.ac.uk/22448/](http://shura.shu.ac.uk/22448/). 

 The game was produced in collaboration between Sheffield Hallam University, Steel Minions Developers and Sony Playstation as part of the REVEAL project. This Virtual Reality \(VR\) Game included a VR, simulation of the house of Georgian Scientist Dr Edward Jenner and was developed applying the asset\-based development methodologies and the use of a several of RAGE components. The 2019 gamification award winning project The Breaking Educational Barriers with Contextualised, Pervasive and Gameful Learning Beaconing project deployed a number of assets and adopted the RAGE processes methodology  [https://beaconing.eu/](https://beaconing.eu/). 

 Another EU funded research and development activity to use the processes, asset\-based methodologies and business models developed is the Intelligent Verification/Validation for Extended Reality Based Systems project which aims to establish a sustainable competitive ecosystem of European technology and solution providers for interactive technologies.  [https://iv4xr\-project.eu/](https://iv4xr-project.eu/). 

 In Portugal, The Escola de Policia Judiciara, the Portugese Police training academy have adopted the RAGE processes and deploy the assets with their development partners in their production of learning materials to help train their police officers to be sympathetic with victims of domestic violence and to satisfy a variety of other training requirements. 

 <ins>Recognition and Awards</ins> 

 Early indications of the potential international impact of the RAGE project were recognised in 2017 when it was selected by the European Commission as one of the finalists of the European Innovation Radar prize. This is a prize for the most promising Early Stage Innovations across the breadth of EU Horizon 2020 programme one of the key criteria for the award was impactful innovation. 

 Furthermore, in 2019, the project was highlighted as being one of the most significant research and innovation projects in the Netherlands. 

 International applied and leisure industry groups and their members have engaged with the project including the United Kingdom Interactive Entertainment \(UKIE\), the Dutch \(Netherlands\) Games Garden, Balkan and French Industries and further evidence of the impact of the project the RAGE Ecosystem, Where the process models and assets are located is that over 850 European industry representatives have directly engaged with the project outputs processes and assets. A number of technical ‘hackathons’ have tested the processes and assets in Amsterdam, Vienna and in Brussels at the European Parliament.  This impact has also been recognised within the EU commission as evidenced by two awards for achievement granted to the project and in the ongoing and significant influence on policy development of future EU research in the applied games development space. 

 The following is an extract from the RAGE \(644187\) Project Final Review Report completed by the European Commission, highlighting the impact of the project; ‘ *RAGE as flagship project in the field of advanced gaming has elaborated an ecosystem for the applied gaming market offering a portal in form of a marketplace for all stakeholders of the applied gaming industry*.’ 

 Sustainability of impact is assured as is the legacy of the research outputs under the custodianship of the recently established, RAGE foundation. In summary, the international impact of the Business Modelling and Management of Asset based development for the Digital Games Industry Case Study has been significant in terms of take up of the models and processes and in serving to stimulate the use of new asset\-based development methodologies to help gain competitive advantage in the emerging applied games industry in the UK, France, Portugal, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Spain.

#  1 Summary of the impact 

 The University of Liverpool’s \(UoL\) *Marine Management Group* develops ecosystem\-based measures to safeguard the world’s seas and oceans and enable sustainable maritime development. Our research has led to change in policy and practice by \(1\) mobilising stakeholders for the governance of the Irish Sea, and \(2\) developing tools for implementing national marine legislation. Specifically \(1\): enabled the creation of **10 Marine Conservation Zones** in English waters, protecting vulnerable species; and established the **Irish Sea Maritime Forum** which works for the integrated governance of the Irish Sea. \(2\): Dutch and Irish agencies and the intergovernmental body for the Northeast Atlantic are using our approach to prioritise management needed under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, leading to **improved environmental status of national waters**; and South Africa is following our procedure for marine spatial planning in the **Eastern Cape marine area**. 
","
#  2 Underpinning research 

 The world’s seas and oceans are under pressure from climate change, pollution and growing human demands. Our research aims to improve human interaction with the sea, bringing the social and natural sciences into direct engagement with government and wider society. 

 Our research began with the interdisciplinary ESRC/NERC seminar series *New Approaches to Managing Ecosystem Services in the Marine Environment* \( **NAMESME**\), coordinated by Kidd \(09/2007\-08/2010\). This involved 5 seminars bringing together UK academics from the natural and social sciences, along with marine planning and management stakeholders. Discussion in these seminars drew out novel connections between marine planning and 100 years of terrestrial spatial planning experience \(3.1\). 

 Kidd led a follow\-on ESRC Knowledge Exchange award *Partnership Working in Support of Marine Spatial Planning in the Irish Sea* \( **MSPIrishSea**\) \(09/2010\-08/2011\). This dealt with the complex regional arrangements for new systems of marine planning, covering 6 national jurisdictions with separate agencies and marine stakeholders. Kidd subsequently led UoL input to the European Commission \(EC\) \(LIFE\) project *Celtic Seas Partnership* \( **CSP**\) \(01/2013\-04/2017\) which developed transboundary cooperation for implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Kidd also developed thinking in stakeholder engagement in marine management through academic publications \(e.g. 3.2\), stressing the need for equitable and representative participation. 

 Robinson led the EC projects \(FP7\) *Options for Delivering Ecosystem\-based Marine Management* \( **ODEMM**\) \(03/2010\-12/2013\) and \(Horizon 2020\) *Knowledge, Assessment and Management for Aquatic Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services* \( **AQUACROSS**\) \(06/2015\-11/2018\). A tool was developed to measure human pressures on regional seas, taking into account ecological risk and potential for recovery \(3.3\). This enables users to evaluate their management options for reducing environment impacts and see the potential for achieving their obligations under the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive, over policy time frames \(3.4\). 

 Jay and Kidd led three EC projects *Transboundary Planning in the European Atlantic* \( **TPEA**\) \(12/2012\-02/2015\) *Supporting Implementation of the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive in the Celtic Seas* \( **SIMCelt**\) \(12/2016\-02/2018\), and *Supporting Implementation in the Atlantic* \( **SIMAtl**\) \(07/2019–06/2021\). These stressed that ecosystem\-based marine management and planning require not just technical solutions, but also integration with legislative and policy frameworks and the close involvement of stakeholder communities \(3.5\). These projects led to recommen\-dations for linking marine spatial planning \(MSP\) to wider political structures and priorities \(3.6\).

#  4 Details of the impact 

 Coastal nations around the world face the challenge of historic misuse of their seas and the consequences of climate change on the oceans. We have worked directly with government agencies and stakeholders to develop practices to manage marine resources in a more sustainable way. These practices have been internalised by organisations which are now carrying them forward in the implementation of national and international policy. This is producing material outcomes in four marine areas: the Irish Sea, the North Sea, the Northeast Atlantic and South Africa’s seas. We have changed the way that agencies and stakeholders act, specifically under two themes. 

##  4.1    Mobilisation of Stakeholders in the Governance of the Irish Sea 

 Good marine ecosystem\-based management needs effective communication between government and stakeholders, ensuring knowledge transfer and better implementation of policy. We have brought stakeholders into the heart of governance of the Irish Sea in two areas of work. 

###  4.1.a   <ins>Stakeholder\-info</ins><ins>rmed Marine Conservation Zones</ins> 

 A programme for designating Marine Conservation Zones \(MCZs\) in English waters began in 03/2010 to protect habitats and species that are important, rare or under threat \(under Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009\). Regional stakeholder groups were tasked with proposing MCZs. 

 Kidd was brought in as independent chair of the Irish Sea Conservation Zones board \(03/2010\-04/2012\), leveraging her knowledge from project work \( **NAMEME** and **MSPIrishSea**\) and expertise in stakeholder\-led approaches \(3.1\). As noted by a water management company Director \(5.1.a\), “Without Sue’s oversight… the Project would have suffered delays in delivery and a lower overall quality of recommendations”. Stakeholders \(such as offshore renewables, fishing, shipping, recreation and conservation\) were “reminded of their obligation to work together, focusing on their common vision rather than their own individual interests”. 

 These pre\-2014 activities provided the essential capacity for subsequent impact. Crucially, the board recommended 15 MCZs, of which 10, covering 1,309km<sup>2</sup>, were finally designated in 2019 \(5.2.a, 5.2.b\), and for which management measures are now being put in place. For example, the Cumbria Coast MCZ stretches along 27km, protecting 8 key features, including honeycomb worm reefs and rocky habitats; it includes England’s only breeding colony of black guillemots which are now protected from fishing nets during the nesting season thanks to a voluntary netting ban brought in as an MCZ measure \(5.2.c\). 

###  4.1.b   <ins>Irish Sea Maritime Forum</ins> 

 As a result of **MSPIrishSea** \(3.2\) **,** Kidd led the formation of the Irish Sea Maritime Forum \(ISMF\) in 06/2012 \(5.3.a\). This is a partnership of government agencies, industry, and environmental stakeholders from across all six Irish Sea jurisdictions. A Science Advisor of Historic England testifies \(5.3.d\), “The Irish Sea Maritime Forum exists due to Sue’s initiative, vision, and leadership skills. Its successes are largely due to her ability to encourage stakeholders to work together”. The Manger of the NW Coastal Forum states \(5.3.c\), “One of the key … benefits of the Forum includes building stronger networks between Irish Sea users.” Its importance is reflected in high\-level political support; its current chair is a former Irish Senator \(5.3.e\). This has provided the platform for subsequent impact. 

 A 2018 stakeholder review demonstrated that ISMF provides the institutional structure needed to facilitate cooperative management of the Irish sea’s resources:  “The Irish Sea is a natural unit… There is a clear need for transboundary cooperation which is met by the ISMF” \(5.4.a\). 

 Activities between 01/2014 and 02/2020, including well\-attended conferences and stakeholder events \(5.3.b\), have benefitted members as revealed through a survey, for example \(5.4.c\): 

-  “Keeping up to date with all new development” \(Northern Ireland Government\) 

-  “Continued cooperation and understanding of issues/opportunities” \(UK Agency\) 

-  “Build capacity to respond to transnational issues” \(Fisheries industry\) 

-  “Having a wide range of stakeholders allows for better outcomes” \(Planning Authority\) 

 A former Liverpool Councillor states “decision makers, including myself, had our views changed and now, wind energy in the Irish Sea is a significant and growing economic and environmental benefit” \(5.4.e\). 

 In addition to these governance changes, impacts include: securing funding worth over €8 million for projects supporting EU Directives for environmental quality and marine planning; *Blue Growth Prospectus for the Irish Sea Region* 2015 setting out opportunities for shipping, blue energy, fisheries, blue biotechnology and tourism \(5.4.b\); and the Ireland\-Wales Interreg project *Ecostructure* that developed concepts for multi\-functional natural and hard sea defences \(5.4.d\). 

##  4.2 Application of Tools for Implementing National and Regional Marine Legislation 

 Marine ecosystem\-based management needs practical approaches that can be used to implement policy and legislation effectively. We have developed tools to enable national agencies to manage their marine resources in the context of two legislative frameworks: the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive and South Africa’s Marine Spatial Planning Act. 

###  4.2.a    <ins>Marine Management Strategies in the Netherlands</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>Ireland</ins> <ins>and beyond</ins> 

 The EU’s 2008 *Marine Strategy Framework Directive* \(MSFD\) aims to address the deteriorating environmental conditions of European seas, requiring coastal Member States to achieve Good Environmental Status \(GES\) of their marine waters by 2020. However, there was no clear approach for reaching this target. Robinson led the **ODEMM** project that produced a *pressure assessment tool* \(3.3, 3.4\) which enables decision makers to identify the key human pressures acting on their marine ecosystems and to select the best measures for achieving GES \(5.5.a,\). 

 Government agencies have now applied this tool to advise governments in Ireland and the Netherlands. It was adopted in 2014 in Ireland to assess the threats to marine environmental status. This was the “first application of the ODEMM framework… completed for Ireland’s marine waters” \(5.6.b\). The findings were used to advise the Irish government on the selection of management measures which since 2018 have now been used to achieve recovery of Irish marine ecosystems. A Principal Investigator for Ireland’s Marine Institute confirms, “We have carried this out using the assessment approach …developed by Dr Robinson” \(5.6.a\). 

 In the Netherlands, the tool has been adapted to underpin selection of management measures in 2018\-20 which are now being used to achieve the GES objectives across Dutch marine waters and the broader North Sea. The Dutch principal Investigator on marine ecosystem\-based management states, “The risk\-based pressure assessment approach developed by Dr Robinson’s team is a really significant contribution to the field because it allows managers the ability to weigh up different options for sustainable use of marine ecosystems. Without this, single\-sector based approaches miss the significant effects of multiple pressures acting on marine species and habitats” \(5.6.c\). 

 The tool has also been used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea \(ICES\), an intergovernmental marine science organisation for the Northeast Atlantic \(5.7a\). The ODEMM tool is now a key part of the technical guidance for the ICES Ecosystem Overviews \(5.7b\), the first set of which were published in 2019\-20 and have affected decisions on ecosystem\-based management across the region over this time\-frame. The ICES Chair testifies, “Leonie’s work in the field of ecosystem\-based marine management has made a very significant contribution to the field both in Europe and across the broader Atlantic region” \(5.6a\). 

###  4.2.b    <ins>Marine Spatial Planning in South Africa</ins> 

 Marine spatial planning \(MSP\) has been introduced by many coastal nations to provide an integrated approach to regulated marine industries; it is now central to marine policy and practice in Europe. MSP was identified as a national priority in 2014 in South Africa, to help manage its extensive and internationally significant marine waters straddling the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with great ecological diversity and social and economic importance. 

 Following his leadership of **MSP projects** and his international reputation \(3.5, 3.6\), Jay was invited onto South Africa’s National Working Group tasked with producing the *National Framework for Marine Spatial Planning*, 09/2015\-03/2016. He was the sole academic in the group, working alongside representatives of government departments. Jay led on the practical section of the Framework, setting out the steps and timeline to be followed by the government department now responsible for MSP in South Africa. He encouraged the adaptation of MSP to the South African context, such as MSP being a tool for redressing historic racial injustices. 

 The Framework was approved by the Minister of Environmental Affairs in 05/2017 \(5.8.b\). It is cross\-referenced in South Africa’s *Marine Spatial Planning Act* 05/2018 \(5.8.c\). Jay’s involvement was coordinated by the German agency for international cooperation who provided logistical support to the process, and described him as having a “significant role” and “an important role in developing the procedural aspects of the Framework” \(5.8.a\). 

 The initial stages of the Framework are now being carried out \(5.8.d\). Firstly, a data portal has been developed that gathers, and makes publicly available, digital data on a wide range of marine characteristics and human activities, providing the evidence base for the marine plans \(5.9.a\). Secondly, four bioregional Marine Planning Areas have been designated. Work is now beginning on the first of these, the Eastern Cape region. Jay continues to support this process. A Director at the Dept of Environment, Forestry & Fisheries confirms that Jay is “currently facilitating international exchange… between government agencies responsible for marine spatial planning in the Global South” \(5.9.b\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The aesthetics of imperfection is an approach to the creation and evaluation of artistic works that values spontaneity and the process of performance over planning, preparation and revision. Hamilton’s development of the aesthetics of imperfection has had a worldwide impact on how artists – primarily musicians \- reflect on, develop, communicate and educate others about their creative practice. Musicians and artists have testified about its effect in producing new creative outputs; outputs that would not have happened otherwise. The discussion of Hamilton’s ideas in public forums has also produced impact on the wider public, especially on those working within the ‘improvised music’ community from Newcastle and the North\-East to New York. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In \[R1\] Hamilton interprets practice in performing and non\-performing arts through the opposition of the *aesthetics of perfection* and *aesthetics of imperfection*. The distinction originates in Ted Gioia's *The Imperfect Art* \(1991\), which contrasts the imperfectionist aesthetic of improvisation, especially jazz, with the perfectionist aesthetic of composition. Hamilton develops the contrast with philosophical rigour, arguing that the rival aesthetics are manifested across *all* musical performance – thus the aesthetics of imperfection is found in interpretation of composed works too. These ideas are revised and developed as part of the monograph \[R2\], and they also inform the edited volume \[R4\]. 

 The case study reflects the conviction that both practical and academic perspectives are required to fully grasp this contrast, and that the views of practitioners concerning their creative activities must be taken very seriously. 

 The aesthetics of imperfection is most readily illustrated by music and performing arts. The aesthetics of imperfection involves *openness to contingencies in the performing situation* – valuing spontaneous creation, which it forces or compels by excluding the possibility of correction. The aesthetics of perfection, in contrast, favours planning over spontaneity, encouraging rigorous refinement of form through preparation and revision. In music, the aesthetics of perfection particularly emphasises the timelessness of the work and the authority of the composer; ultimately Platonic, it views works essentially as abstract sound\-structures. The aesthetics of imperfection, in contrast, is humanistic, valuing the event or process of performance. These rival aesthetics are prominent in the modern Western artistic system, but occur across history and cultures in different forms. In Western classical music, they were crystallised in the contrasting modernisms of Arnold Schoenberg, who stressed the authority of the composer and obedience of the performer, and Ferruccio Busoni, who valued the individual interpretations of performers. 

 In the 20th century, the aesthetics of imperfection appears most strikingly in jazz, and the improvised musics jazz has inspired; Hamilton explores this in conversation with leading musicians in these fields, both in the biography \[R3\] and in his music criticism in international London\-based new music magazine *The Wire*, and elsewhere \[R5\]. But the aesthetics of imperfection is by no means limited to improvised forms, or indeed to music; for Hamilton, there is a reciprocity between improvisation and composition, and between the aesthetics of perfection and imperfection. Successful improvisation has the appearance of composition – it is well\-formed. At the same time, a compelling interpretation of a composition has the appearance of an improvisation – it seems spontaneously created. So the dialectic of imperfection versus perfection applies to the interpretation of composed works, as well as to improvisation; the aesthetics of imperfection is not simply an aesthetics of improvisation. Another way of putting these claims is to say that improvisation and composition are interpenetrating opposites. Although the main focus of the research has been music, it is a key finding that the aesthetics of imperfection applies beyond the performing arts, notably in the visual arts. It should also be stressed that the underpinning research has itself been affected by continuing debate with the artists and musicians who have been impacted. There is a continuing exchange of ideas.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Hamilton’s research has changed the creative practices of an influential body of reflective musicians and artists innovating in avant\-garde disciplines in the UK and beyond. The practitioners involved are leading representatives of jazz and related improvising\-based art forms *,* and contemporary Western classical composition. The principal beneficiaries of this case study are from the field of art music. In the Western world, art music is divided into the performance of composed music \(such as Western classical\), and the performance of improvised music \(including jazz\). The latter has the smaller category of musicians and listeners, and involves some of the most radical and experimental music. 

 Impact was generated through a series of workshops that involved approximately 30 leading improvising musicians over three years in Newcastle and Durham \(April 2016, April 2017, October 2018, and October 2019\). The workshops provided an opportunity for knowledge exchange between Hamilton and the musicians present, and invited participants to respond directly to Hamilton's work on the aesthetics of imperfection. Resulting from the workshops is the edited collection, *The Aesthetics of Imperfection in Music and the Arts*, eds. Andy Hamilton and Lara Pearson \(London: Bloomsbury, 2020\). It was decided that statements of impact would be solicited in the form of testimonials, but the testimonials must be understood in the light of their authors’ contributions to the above volume, which provide necessary context and explanation. In their articles, contributors showed the influence of Hamilton's ideas on their thought and practice, which is clarified in some cases through testimonials. 

 The Director of Jazz North East, the oldest grant\-supported jazz promoting body in the UK and a leading specialist promoter of improvised music from around the world, described the musicians involved in the project as “a remarkable collection of many of the major figures in improvised music in Britain and Europe, plus important players in North America and Australia"" \[E1\]. A sample of the musicians involved include improvising saxophonist Evan Parker, “a major force in European improvising”, who has released over 200 recordings and regularly plays at major international venues including London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room, and Wigmore Hall. Others, including Joe McPhee \(US\), Dave Brown \(Australia\), The Necks \(Australia\), Linda Catlin Smith \(Canada\) and John Snijders \(UK/Netherlands\) are internationally known performers and composers whose work can be heard at major festivals and venues such as Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Sydney's Now Now, Other Minds Festival San Francisco, Amsterdam's Bimhuis, and London’s Café Oto. They have performed with such major ensembles and figures as the London Sinfonietta, Ives Ensemble, and other top practitioners of avant\-garde music. 

 Beyond art music Hamilton's workshops  attracted people from a range of other art forms: people in the field of comedy, including one participant who works with leading UK stand\-up comedian Stewart Lee, and commercially\-successful metal band Sonic Youth draw on improvised techniques in their practice. 

####  Impact on influential musicians 

 The four workshops described above took place over a period of three years, and invited creative practitioners in attendance to reflect on, and respond directly to, Hamilton’s research meaningfully and in a sustained way leading to changes in professional creative practice. The workshops attracted approximately 200 attendees, including music fans, students, amateur musicians, teachers and arts administrators. Ideas about improvisation and imperfection in performance arising from Hamilton’s research were exchanged, and then developed by individual practitioners in relation to their own work. 

 \(a\) *Brighton\-based pianist\-composer Stephanie Cant* has derived insight and practical tools from Hamilton’s research. Cant's music is performed by internationally\-recognised musicians including Michala Petri, Evgenia Startseva, Bobby Chen and Andrew Bernardi/BMG. She has performed her own works at St James's Piccadilly, Chapel Royal Brighton, Sage Gateshead and other UK venues, and runs the Butterfly Concerts to promote serendipity in performance. She writes: “\[Hamilton’s research\] provided an impetus to reset aspects of my artistic endeavours… As a performer, I have begun once again to prepare with a general view of a work in mind, rather than attempting to hone a particular and detailed response to it... I am seeking to \[show\] others how the now prevalent rigorous predetermination of performance often misrepresents the intentions of past composers…\[Hamilton’s research\] helps these ideas...have a voice in the wider musical world – which needs them, or concerts will die. It will help my recording engineer to understand how some of his techniques privilege this sort of 'anti\-music' and why. Giving legitimacy to the problems I raise... he cannot brush them away as my incompetence.” 

 These changes to her practice have impacted on audiences: “I have discovered that audiences really appreciate an inspired performance arising from this kind of preparation, and are mostly not aware of slips or errors...The response is far more positive than the response to a contrived interpretation.” This impact is tangible through Cant’s teaching: “Reading Hamilton’s work \[I\] realised that my own artistic activity… had been drifting in the directions I now censure. Teaching students preparing for undergraduate piano performance examinations, I had begun to privilege accuracy and certainty over inspiration and serendipity of outcome.” Cant reports that the impact of Hamilton’s ideas on the musical activities she organises: “They encourage me to pursue my activities as a concert organiser, through the series of ‘Butterfly Concerts’ I have established, in which serendipity is encouraged and audience engagement is profound. I also support artists who run more established festivals and concert series from motivations similar to mine” \[E2\]. 

 \(b\) *Visual artist and 2018 workshop participant Claire Zakiewicz* develops ideas from the project in a February 2019 article in The *Hypocrite Reader*, A New York based monthly magazine: “I was influenced by Hamilton’s ideas to recognise the value of developing process\-orientated practices and in particular an imperfectionist aesthetic in my drawings, drawing practice \(drawing performance\) and collaborations. I have much better understood how embracing or even using imperfections, glitches and mistakes as material, taking risks \(impulsive as well as thought\-through\) and exploring degrees of control and letting go can lead to an increasingly inventive and resourceful practice” \[E3\]. 

 \(c\) *Adam Fairhall a Manchester\-based jazz and improvising pianist* described by *The* *Independent* as “a total star,” recent commercial recordings show the impact of Hamilton’s ideas: “Hamilton’s account of idiosyncratic technique as a function of an improviser’s aesthetic… led me to consider more systematically the...functions of idiosyncratic technique in free improvisation and jazz. This led me to consider my recent practical experiments with unusual keyboard instruments as constituting an overall project, an investigation into idiosyncratic technique. Hamilton’s article provided a critical framework for this project, resulting in insights into my practice that have clarified its purpose and potential \[and\] a renewed vigour in my work on these instruments, and last year resulted in a commercially released album which features this work. This year will see the release of at least two more albums” \[E4\]. 

 Direct impacts have extended to this jazz musician’s collaborations: “Hamilton’s notion of composition and improvisation as ‘interpenetrating’ opposites has led me to reflect on the use of composition in the projects I am involved with, particularly a piano trio – ‘Fragments’… This piano trio has just released its debut album, and I have cited Hamilton’s notion of composition and improvisation as ‘interpenetrating opposites’ in correspondence with potential reviewers” \[E4\]. 

 \(d\) *Jazz pianist Darius Brubeck* describes the broader impact of Hamilton’s research on jazz. In a chapter for *The Aesthetics of Imperfection* volume, interpreting the work of his father Dave Brubeck, he writes: “The challenge of grappling with jazz as a serious art form has accelerated the development of the discourse about the aesthetics of imperfection. This wouldn’t happen, of course, unless philosophers like Hamilton took jazz seriously” \[E5\]. 

 \(e\) *Ben Holmes a New York\-based jazz and klezmer trumpeter* comments: ""I wrote out this quote \[from Hamilton's *Lee Konitz* book\] on an index card and stuck it up in my practice room: 'It’s a matter of slowing down the process with enough space to stay relaxed. Not getting tense and breathing in a relaxed way are the keys to the good ideas department'. It's a motif of Hamilton's book on Konitz that to be truly spontaneous, improvising can't proceed faster than thinking. I’ve been dedicating some time every day to playing improvised music \(either standards or free\), and incorporating this approach, and using it to re\-evaluate old licks and habits."" \[E6\] 

 \(f\) *John Pope a Sage\-Gateshead featured composer, improviser and educator* notes that his “…exposure to Andrew Hamilton’s ‘Aesthetics of Imperfection seminars have given me an insight into an alternative conception for the virtues of improvisation in music, and their echoes in other disciplines and artistic practices. Traditional notions of ‘perfection’ in music, especially as it relates to form and composition, frequently leave little room for the elements of improvisation that give it value to the artist or listener, and force the discourse around the music to approach it on terms unsuitable for realising the ‘real work’ that is going on.” He notes that these seminars have “been very influential in my own thinking and music making, and I believe will come to be seen as an important field of study in the acceptance of improvisation into a wider field of musical academia.” \[E7\] 

####  Impact beyond professional musicians: local outcomes 

 While targeted at professional musicians and creative practitioners working at the top of their fields, the workshops also attracted people with different levels of involvement in art music, and at different stages of development in their own creative practice. One amateur jazz musician described how the event changed how he thought about improvisation and composition: “\[It gave me\] greater freedom to write less harmonically defined and unmetered sections/pieces \[and\] greater understanding of the process behind other people’s methods of writing and listening"". \[E8\] 

 More generally, the three public workshops have impacted on local musical communities, furthering educational aims, and changing perceptions of improvised music. The Director of the Newcastle Festival of Jazz and Improvised Music 2018 and 2019, which hosted those years’ workshops, noted its contribution in bringing improvised music to new audiences, enhancing understanding among a wider public, and developing the careers of artists: “Andy Hamilton's participation was a key part of this engagement” \[E8\]. 

####  Impact beyond professional musicians: education and global reach 

 The impact of Hamilton’s research also extends beyond those who attended the workshops into a wider body of practitioners, educators and a broader public not involved in the workshop/volume project. A prominent Australian sound artist, scholar and curator with a specific interest in remote wilderness regions and their communities has taken Hamilton’s research as the basis for his work in music education. He comments that: “Hamilton’s sustained and thoughtful research… into the Aesthetics of Imperfection underpins my own approach to teaching in which I use the classroom to experiment with different modes of delivery in order to introduce moments of chance and spontaneity to my lessons. In these circumstances I invite imperfection into the classroom to privilege different ways of knowing and communicating – a force to disrupt routine and expectation. I also direct my students to many of Andy’s scholarly works including the remarkable body of work he has produced for The Wire tracing some of the most important developments in the field of Jazz, Classical Music and Sound Art. Andy’s Aesthetics and Music has been on my recommended reading list since it was published…and is an important source for discussion regarding the nature and origins of perception and aesthetic appreciation.” \[E9\] 

 The global reach of Hamilton’s research within the music\-community is further evidenced by its online profile. In the period November 2018 to March 2020 there have been over 830 viewings of talks at the Aesthetics of Imperfection workshops \[E10\]. In an online video, New York\-based bassist and composer Adam Neely refers to Hamilton’s research \[R2\] in a discussion of virtuosity and difficult music that has been viewed over 1,400,000 times \(as of 24 February 2020\), attracting over 4,000 comments, from across Europe and North America. He comments: “In his book ‘Aesthetics and Music’, \[which discusses the aesthetics of imperfection\], Andy Hamilton explains how the ‘devilry, risk, excitement and relief’ of virtuosity is a thing we experience in music aside from music itself.” \[E10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted at the University of Dundee investigating European avant\-garde art through video and photography archives has led to the following impacts: 

-  Halted the deterioration of key works of art\-historical and cultural value, leading to major exhibitions in Bucharest and Sao Paolo of previously unknown or inaccessible materials; 

-  Created accessible online archive resources revealing the histories of video and performance to new generations; 

-  Built new audiences through publication, broadcast and exhibition, including the direct initiation of seminal exhibitions in Edinburgh, Venice and Shanghai; and 

-  Engaged with the museum sector to ensure works which we have restored are preserved within national collections in London and Edinburgh, ensuring ongoing benefit through public access.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research into the histories of the post\-war British and European avant\-gardes was initiated through two AHRC funded projects: REWIND *Artists’ Video in the 1970s & 1980s* \( **Partridge** 2003\-2007\), and *The Demarco Archive: Accessing a 40\-year Dialogue between Richard Demarco and the European Avant\-Garde* \( **McArthur** 2004\-2008\). 

 REWIND researchers investigated the first two decades of British video art, addressing gaps in the knowledge of early and pioneering work conducted in the UK between 1970\-90. The research involved the investigation of over 400 seminal artworks. These were archived and conserved using emerging technologies, simultaneously researching and developing restoration techniques for obsolete analogue video formats, thus revealing and preserving lost works in their original conceptual and technical context **\[R5\]**. This innovative work led to the establishment of the REWIND *Media Preservation Lab* in 2005, this is now a key research centre in the UK for the investigation of improved methods by which we can preserve a wider range of obsolete media. In 2006 we established the first of our online databases: REWIND *Artists Video*. 

 From this, further AHRC projects were established: REWIND *Italia* \( **Partridge** 2011\-14\) and *European Women’s Video Art* \( **Shemilt** 2015\-18\). Both studies re\-evaluated marginalised practice in the canon of media art history. The results of this research were published in two books  with chapters by **Partridge, Shemilt, Lockhart** and **Leuzzi** **\[R2\]**. *REWIND | Italia, Early Video Art in Italy*, which brings seminal, early video experimentation into the international spotlight and provides a vital resource for research and study with key Italian texts available for the first time in English **\[R2\]**. *European Women’s Video Art in the 70s and 80s* provides a reassessment of women artists’ involvement in early video art and strengthens their profiles and identities within the art historical canon **\[R3\]** – on its launch, the Director of Civic Museums Venice \(5/9/19\) stated: 

 ‘*Finally a book is published that collects the most significant evidence of extraordinary work often on the sidelines of knowledge and art history*’ **\[E1\]**. 

 The *Demarco Digital Archive* **\[R4\]** was established in 2008 \(updated 2017\) by a team of six, led by **McArthur**. It created a fully searchable online resource of over 10,000 photographs and 700 supporting documents. In the course of the research over half a million photographic prints, slides and negatives were viewed and selected according to agreed criteria. The content covered the extensive range of Demarco’s engagement with the visual art, theatre and post\-war cultural milieu, particularly from Eastern Europe. 

 An enduring function of the research preserved in the Archive is to reveal the lost art of the post\-war period, particularly by the artists of Poland, Romania and the former Yugoslavia who, along with parts of Germany, were trapped behind the Iron Curtain. The discovery and restoration of the video footage of Taduesz Kantor’s *The Water Hen* **\[R1\]**, shot in an obscure format even for 1972, is detailed later in this case study. There is growing interest in these countries among younger and independent curators working to reclaim the ‘unofficial’ art proscribed by the art establishments of the communist era; through its preservation of culturally significant artefacts Archive is enabling the curation of public exhibitions and performances of historical and cultural importance that would otherwise remain inaccessible. 

 Elements of research initiated within REWIND and Demarco Digital have now been consolidated and further expanded through *Richard Demarco: The Italian Connection* \(AHRC 2018\-20\) led by **Shemilt** with **Partridge, Leuzzi** and **Lockhart**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Two teams of researchers within the *Visual Practice, Curation and Critique* research grouping at DJCAD have, over the last sixteen years, investigated aspects of British and European art practice from the 1960s onward, having drawn on expertise developed within our Digital Archives. Projects informed or initiated by these archives have created a global engagement of over half a million visits. The online databases currently receive an average of 700 active users per month, the majority in the younger age bracket of 18\-44 \(Google Analytics retrieved 10/12/20\); in addition, the Demarco Digital Archive has 164 subscribers, each of whom have made their own online curations. 

 Preservation and democratisation of cultural assets 

 McArthur and Watson’s research into the Demarco Digital Archive uncovered original video reels of Tadeusz Kantor’s *The Water Hen* from a performance in 1972. The previously unknown footage  was digitized and restored by Lockhart, transcribed by researchers at Kantor’s archive in Krakow, then translated in Edinburgh. This formed the basis for McArthur’s subtitling, moving the raw translation into English that paralleled the colloquial nature of the original dialogue. 

 The significance of the footage was confirmed by the leading Kantor scholar, who spoke at the press launch of the *UNESCO International Year of Kantor*: 

 ‘*The efforts of the Media Archives Team cannot be overstated… prior to the discovery and digitization of the Kurka Wodna/Water Hen footage, there was no recording available of Kantor’s productions from his object/machine theatre, 1944\-1975… Consequently, any effort to provide analysis of performance style or on\-stage dramaturgy in Kantor’s theatre was speculative and inconclusive*.’ **\[E3\]** 

 In 2015 *The Water Hen* was screened in Venice during the Biennale, and subsequently in Gdansk, Warsaw, Berlin, Dusseldorf and Tokyo. The restored *Water Hen* was central to a major exhibition in Sao Paolo \(18/8/15\-14/11/15\) attended by 90,000 visitors. 

 The exhibition *24 Arguments:* *Early Encounters in Romanian Neo\-Avant\-Garde 1969\-71* at The National Museum of Romania similarly drew on materials restored and preserved by the research team, in this case the digitization of a film capturing two seminal performances made by Paul Neagu during his thirty\-year exile in the UK, described as: 

 ‘*an essential act in the exhibition, given the fact that the Romanian public have never had access to the works and documents presented in the exhibition*.’ **\[E2\]** 

 The REWIND *Media Preservation Lab* has ensured the preservation of footage that would otherwise have been lost to future generations, as evidenced by projects such as the *The London Community Video Archive* \(with Goldsmiths\), which provides a significant record of counter\-cultural events and happenings in 70s & 80s London. The Lab’s work in transferring obsolete video to digital formats has been praised as ‘ *recovering and revising this history... as a resource for contemporary debates and activism*’ **\[E4\]**. 

 Lockhart’s curation of works from REWIND featured along with >>FFWD Artist’s Moving Image from Scotland, as part of CURRENT, Phase Two at the Shanghai Minsheng Art Museum \(17/12/16\-15/1/17\). This was the second in a series of exhibitions across China and brought seminal early UK video works to China for the first time, exhibited alongside contemporary Scottish video art. The exhibition received 7,500 actual visitors and 157,000 online visits, garnering media attention across 45 outlets including the Shanghai Daily \(22/12/16\), which stated: 

 ‘*Excavating the radical history encapsulated in seminal artists video works from the 70s & 80s, REWIND provides an in\-depth perspective on the moving image*.’ **\[E5\]** 

 A catalyst for physical and digital cultural legacies 

 In 2014 Creative Scotland commissioned a consultancy which recommended uniting the materials still held by Demarco with those in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art \(this had been prompted by an earlier exhibition curated by McArthur and Watson which had provoked a debate in the Scottish Parliament committing the Scottish Government to housing the Demarco Archive\). An extensive site was purchased in north Edinburgh and plans for the new building were passed in 2018. The consolidated archive will be housed as a discrete unit within the planned £75 million National Galleries of Scotland \(NGS\) Collections Hub. This is described by the Director General NGS as a: 

 ‘*significant infrastructure development in a socially deprived area in Edinburgh…construction is scheduled to start 2022/3… A significant part of this building will be publicly accessible facilities for research, study, exhibitions and education*.’ **\[E6\]** 

 A further impact of our growing reputation for digital archiving has led the internationally renowned performance artist, Alastair MacLennan, to deposit his entire archive \(21/12/18\) documenting over 600 performances and installations to join existing holdings of his work within REWIND and *Demarco Digital*. This gives a unique opportunity to capture the development of this growing legacy through a living archive. 

 Several major acquisitions were made, by Tate, of historic works made visible by REWIND, embedding a significant body of under\-represented work within a national collection and consequently ensuring the long\-term conservation and further dissemination through one of the most important collections of modern and contemporary art in the world. The expertise of the research team is acknowledged by the Tate: 

 ‘… *only 2 or 3 possible laboratories in the world with this set of skills and knowledge… that not only could transfer this early video format, but would also understand the context of video art in the 70s*…’ **\[E8\]** 

 The acquisitions include David Hall’s *TV Interruptions: The Installation* acquired in 2014; Stephen Partridge’s *Monitor* in 2015, exhibited 2016\-17. Tina Keane’s *Faded Wallpaper* \(1988\) and her *In Our Hands Greenham* \(1984\) were acquired in 2017 and 2020 respectively, following research into, and reconstitution of, the original installation **\[E7\]**. *The Lab* also collaborated with Tate in 2019, \(prior to accession and exhibition\) on the digitisation of Darcy Lange’s pioneering social documentary video practice: *Studies of Teaching in Four Oxfordshire Schools* \(1977\). 

 These ‘ *pioneering but previously overlooked’* **\[E7\]** video works are now central to Tate’s digital legacy. The contribution of REWIND and its related projects are described by the responsible acquisitions manager \(now at The Museum of Modern Art, New York\) as ‘ *crucial to re\-assessing the canon of UK video art’* **\[E7\]**. 

 Stimulating and showcasing creative works 

 Publications stemming from REWIND activity led to wider impact by opening artists’ video to a general audience. *REWIND | Italia, Early Video Art in Italy* brings seminal, early video experimentation into an international spotlight, providing a vital resource for research and study by making important Italian texts available for the first time in English **\[R2\]**. The UK Launch included a performance at CCA, Glasgow by artist Claudio Ambrosini described by *Art Monthly* \(9/16\) as: 

 *‘a significant piece of research and a vital contribution to any library of video art history’* and *Italian Journal Arshake \(2/3/16\) ‘a useful and extremely valuable too*l’ **\[E9\]**. 

 Conversely an extended, non\-specialist audience of 300,000 \(production company academy7\) were introduced, most for the first time, to artist’s video in *Kill Your TV, Jim Moir’s* \(Vic Reeves\) *Weird World of Video Art* \(BBC4 24/11/19 with further audiences via iPlayer and repeat broadcast\). Lockhart was both consultant and interviewee whilst works by Partridge and Shemilt were among twelve selected from the REWIND archive featured on the programme. All unedited interviews from the programme were deposited in the REWIND archive **\[E10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The University of Liverpool VISION research unit \(led by Prof Rowe\) is unique in focussing on research for post\-stroke visual impairment \(PSVI\). PSVI effects 60% of stroke survivors but has historically been under\-recognised, with poor detection and referral to eye care services, leading to restricted quality of life. UoL’s work has established incidence/prevalence rates of PSVI, essential components for vision screening, requirements for eye service provision, user\-defined impact of visual impairment, and consensus on management strategies. This has provided the underpinning evidence for present day PSVI policies, guidelines and clinical practice in the UK and internationally. This work has led to a significant change in clinical and societal recognition of PVSI, screening and services in the UK and internationally, and a doubling in stroke units including vision stroke services. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Visual impairment after stroke \(PSVI\) is common, debilitating and costly. Most stroke survivors with visual impairment report a reduction in quality of life. This is particularly true if the visual impairment is unidentified and therefore not recognised by the multi\-disciplinary team. For many stroke survivors, visual impairment results in inability or altered ability to undertake many aspects of daily activities with impact on return to work, participation in hobbies and family life, and can lead to social isolation, altered mood and depression. Wide\-ranging benefits to patients, their carers and the NHS can be achieved through early and accurate identification of PSVI and integrated screening and care services. 

 In order to improve outcomes for people with PSVI, the University of Liverpool VISION unit led by Professor Rowe, has carried out a programme of research with clinicians, stroke survivors and charities over the last decade. We have demonstrated the significant impact of visual impairment to stroke survivors and explored difficulties related to care provision through a range of studies including: systematic reviews, studies on screening, assessment, course and management of PSVI, and qualitative work exploring the impact of PSVI and unmet needs of stroke survivors. We have developed interventions and led evaluations \(10 randomised control trials/cohort studies\) addressing patient care pre and post discharge. UoL’s work has led to over 50 active NHS/academic collaborations in the delivery of multi\-site studies and the largest UK database for PSVI. 

##  Evidence synthesis: 

 UoL’s systematic reviews \(Cochrane Library/independent narrative reviews\) have examined the efficacy of screening methods \[3.1\] and effectiveness of interventions for PSVI \[3.2,  [www.cochranelibrary.com](http://www.cochranelibrary.com/)\]. All reviews found insufficient evidence for screening methods and interventions, leading to epidemiology, screening and rehabilitation research in PSVI to address these unmet needs. 

##  Epidemiology studies: 

 We recruited 915 \(VIS study\) and 1500 \(IVIS study\) patients for the world’s largest completed observation studies on PSVI \(Rowe as CI;  [https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population\-health\-sciences/staff/fiona\-rowe/](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/staff/fiona-rowe/)\). Findings consistently show lack of standardisation across services, poor detection of PSVI, poor referral and inconsistent management. 

##  Screening for PSVI: 

 Rowe designed and validated a screening form for use by the generic stroke team, which reported a 92% positive predictive value \[3.1\]. UoL’s screening form was adopted by the British and Irish Orthoptic Society \(BIOS:  [www.orthoptics.org.uk](http://www.orthoptics.org.uk/)\) and remains the national approved stroke vision screening form. We subsequently developed a visual impairment screening assessment \( *VISA*\) tool. Validation studies \[3.3\] showed VISA to be a reliable and sensitive means of screening for visual impairment in acute stroke survivors. A spin\-off screening assessment for paramedic 999 stroke call\-outs and Stroke Association 6\-month reviews evolved from VISA. We led a national team to create a stroke\-vision care pathway to pull all screening, assessment and referral aspects of care together \[3.4\]. 

##  Specialist assessment for PSVI: 

 Rowe’s clinical practice scoping surveys \[3.5\] identified a lack of standardised specialist visual assessment leading to the development of a professional body \(BIOS\) consensus statement \(led by Rowe\). We defined essential and desirable recommendations for service provision. We surveyed 548 clinical professionals \(UK\-based/international\), patients and carers to identify core outcome measures for PSVI assessment \[3.5\]. These results underpinned the professional development of care pathways in relation to screening, specialist assessment and driving \[3.4\]. 

##  Visual rehabilitation for PSVI: 

 UoL’s reviews identified considerable variability in management options. An important part of this research has been to source the best evidence\-based treatments for visual impairment. The VISION group specifically identified homonymous hemianopia \(type of visual field loss\) as a visual condition causing considerable impact to patient lives. Following a clinical trial of two interventions versus standard care \(no treatment\) a significant improvement to vision\-related quality of life for visual scanning training was reported \[3.6\]. These results have informed the development of a larger definitive trial commencing 2020, funded by Fight for Sight and the Stroke Association.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Stroke is the leading cause of disability affecting 15,000,000 globally \(World Health Organisation\). There are in excess of 100,000 new strokes per annum in the UK and 1,200,000 stroke survivors \(the Stroke Association Statistics\). Despite new onset visual impairment in 60% of cases, services and care for stroke survivors with visual impairment are limited. UoL’s research includes pioneering studies providing evidence to underpin clinical practice and the development of research studies and national guidelines \(e.g. Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party, British and Irish Orthoptic Society \(BIOS\), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network\). A key impact of the University of Liverpool VISION unit’s research has been change to clinical practice guidelines, services and education, benefitting stroke survivors and their families, orthoptists, ophthalmologists, stroke physicians, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. 

##  National and international guidelines: 

 Rowe leads the vision group for the national Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party and her research on prevalence/incidence of PSVI, assessment and management led to a fully revised, evidence\-based vision section in the 2016 National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke \[5.1\]. 

 *“Because of the case she \[Prof Rowe\] made for the first time in 2016 we included a separate section on vision in stroke.”* \(National Clinical Director for Stroke, NHS England, 2019\) \[5.2.1\]. 

 Rowe was the vision advisor on the 2013 guideline panel for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) stroke rehabilitation in adults \[5.3\], which focused on producing evidence\-based clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of NHS patient care. As a result of her involvement, NICE guidelines changed to include new recommendations on referral and management of stroke\-related vision problems. 

 Rowe’s research informed a professional body consensus statement by BIOS outlining the orthoptic staffing requirements for acute stroke units and recommendations for vision assessment and management \[5.4\]. Rowe co\-wrote the BIOS professional practice guidelines for extended clinical practice in stroke \[5.5\] documenting the essential and desirable requirements for stroke care provided by orthoptists. These documents have been used by NHS Trusts \[5.2\] to support the development of new vision stroke services and maintenance of existing services. A survey published by Rowe in 2010 found integrated stroke\-vision services had increased from 45% of units to above 80% in the prior 10 years\). 

 “*We utilised many of the studies and reviews that Prof Rowe has published in order to evidence the need for orthoptic input into the Stroke service, as part of our successful business case.”* \(Lead Stroke Orthoptist, St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust\) \[5.2.2\]. 

 We have provided the evidence underpinning incidence and prevalence figures for PSVI and the types of visual conditions that occur. UoL’s findings are cited worldwide \[5.2.10\]. 

##  Service provision and international reach: 

 The VISION unit’s research highlights the need for better identification, specialist assessment and management of PSVI. Identification of gaps in evidence led to the development of the Rowe \(VIS\) screening form, which is now routinely used by BIOS and orthoptists across the UK in their stroke services which has improved the detection of PSVI \[5.2, 5.6\]. 

 Rowe contributed to writing the BIOS stroke care pathway \[5.7\] which was changed to reflect the evidence provided by Rowe’s research and provide improved signposting for patient care. In recognition of the limited scope of the BIOS pathway to acute care, Rowe led a national team to develop a wide\-reaching process pathway to capture stroke\-vision problems at all stages from pre\-hospital care to post\-stroke community care \[5.8\]. 

 Gaps in evidence also informed the development of research commissioned by the Stroke Association, which comprehensively outlined key needs of stroke survivors with visual impairment. In this report \[5.9\] and related publications, Rowe outlined the key features of an exemplar stroke vision service, UK\-wide professional clinician responses on assessment methods, management options and information resources. In recognition of outstanding contributions to stroke and vision services, BIOS awarded Rowe a national service recognition award in 2015. 

 Assessment at 6 months post stroke is a component of the National Stroke Strategy, and visual problems now form one facet that is encompassed in such checks; for example, inclusion in the Greater Manchester Stroke Assessment Tool \(GMSAT\). This research has reach beyond the UK. For example, groups in Australia, USA, India, Norway and the Netherlands have sought to improve their screening for PSVI and are have adopted UoL’s VISA screening with language translation where needed. 

 *“I then applied for funding for a national network on vision and stroke \[now agreed NOK5,000,000, \~GBP5,000,000\]. Fiona is on the steering committee and part of some of the working groups. We are using her research to build our cases and compare findings to see if we can structure things similarly”*. \(Associate Professor, NorVIS study\) \[5.2.3\]. 

##  Resources and education: 

 Rowe is an international expert advisor for PSVI, advising BIOS, Department of Health, UK Stroke Association, and Royal National Institute for the Blind \(RNIB\). UoL’s research has been widely disseminated at RNIB and Stroke Association national education events and conferences with impact at individual practitioner level. For example, feedback from a clinician at the Northern Ireland Multi Agency Stroke Team conference in 2016: 

 “*This has changed my practice for the future by making me more aware….I was surprised to hear what a large percentage of stroke patients do have visual problems post stroke*.” \[5.2.11\] 

 Rowe has overseen the writing of Stroke Association and RNIB stroke/vision information factsheets \[5.10\] which remain key download documents from their websites. Rowe has developed a range of resources for clinical practice and for patients which are used widely \(247 department downloads; 23/06/2020\) in the NHS \( [www.vision\-research.co.uk](http://www.vision-research.co.uk/)\). 

 *“If we didn’t have access to any of Fiona’s resources, it’s quite possible that ECLO’s would not see so many patients that had had strokes, stroke survivors wouldn’t have resources specific to them, and possibly wouldn’t know that they were even there, people would slip through the net”*. \(Clinical Lead for the Eye Clinic Support Team, RNIB\) \[5.2.4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In 2018, the transport sector was the largest \(27%\) emitter of greenhouse gasses in the UK, with 86% of transport emissions coming from road vehicles. To meet the government’s “net zero by 2050” goal, the transport sector will need to be revolutionised. Research being conducted at Imperial College London \(“Imperial”\) has already had the following impact: 

1.  Replacing steel in car panels with lighter aluminium using the Hot Form Quench \(HFQ®\) Technology that is being commercialised via Imperial spinout company **Impression Technologies Limited** founded in 2013, producing over <ins>100,000 units</ins> from a UK supplier in 2019. 

1.  Improving turbochargers, enabling engine downsizing, leading to improved fuel economy and hence CO2 reduction. Imperial designs are in production at **Mitsubishi Heavy Industries**, with <ins>2,200,000</ins> <ins>units produced</ins> in the current REF period and a demonstrated fuel economy benefit of 2.2%.  Furthermore, our research is now being used by Caterpillar and Daimler AG. 

1.  Imperial spinout **Ceres Power Ltd**. \(founded in 2001\) has developed a high efficiency \(50%, compared to 30% of a typical automotive engine\), fuel flexible system, currently being deployed as an electric bus range extender in collaboration with Chinese company Weichai Power. Ceres has doubled its revenue in the previous four consecutive years, a market capitalisation of over GBP2,000,000,000, and <ins>opened</ins> <ins>a new factory</ins> in the UK, creating 60 skilled jobs in 2020.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Coordinated by Imperial’s Energy Future Lab, founded by **Prof. Brandon** in 2005, the following underpinning research activities were undertaken, which are testament to Imperial’s leadership in the area of emissions reduction for road vehicles: 

1.  Automotive body panels and chassis structures have conventionally been made from steel, despite the fact that using high strength aluminium alloys could significantly reduce their weight and thus reduce the emissions of the vehicles they support. This is because aluminium is difficult to form/stamp into the complex shapes required. A novel technology, Hot Form Quench \(HFQ®\), has been developed and patented by Imperial’s **Prof. Lin** and his team \(WO2011/058332A1\). HFQ enables high strength aluminium alloys to be stamped to form similar shaped components to those that have previously been produced using steel. New theories and experimental techniques have been created for the modelling and characterisation of materials at hot stamping conditions \[R1, R2\], significantly advancing the state\-of\-the\-art. For example, a continuum damage mechanics theory for modelling “forming limit diagrams” has been established \[R1\] for the first\-time. This theory has been implemented in the commercial simulation software Pamstamp by ESI \(A world leading software developer headquartered in France\), making it available to the global hot stamping industry for process optimisation. A unique test rig has been developed and patented \(U.S. Patent 15/751,605\), which enables, for the first time, forming limit diagrams to be generated for sheet metals at hot stamping conditions \[R2\]. 

 2. Development of turbochargers that harness the unsteady energy emerging from engines is essential to achieve high energy efficiency. The state of the art in design and engine air management only makes use of the steady components, thus forcing the design along lines of quasi\-steady operation. Critically, such an approach does not harness the full energy potential contained in an unsteady flow and implies sub\-optimal component choices \(leading to higher emission impact\). **Prof. Martinez\-Botas** was first to incorporate unsteady effects into turbocharger models, which has since become industry standard. The recognition of volume effects in the turbine \[R3\] is now common on all simulation methods for turbocharger matching. His group undertook the first unsteady 3D simulation of a turbocharger under pulsating conditions, bringing the device to real engine conditions \[R3\]. The recognition of unsteady conditions on the compressor \[R4\] has led to an improvement in the stability margin that it is being incorporated in engine design programs. 

 3. Research into materials processing methods suitable for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells \(SOFCs\) was pursued by Imperial’s **Prof. Brandon** and colleagues since 2000. In particular, their work on ceria\-based electrolytes \[R5\] enabled the design of cells with lower operating temperature. Conventional SOFC technologies need to be held at around 800 °C to operated efficiently, which adds significant cost to the housing as it requires special materials. However, Brandon et al. showed that by changing the electrolyte material, it is possible to operate efficiently at less than 600 °C. Furthermore, the use of composite electrode materials to improve rate performance at low temperatures \[R6\] was demonstrated. This concept combined the properties of two ceramic materials synergistically, resulting in electrodes that facilitate the chemistry at the surfaces, as well as showing sufficient mechanical strength and low\-cost. These patented processing innovations enabled the use of porous steel as the cell’s support, which unlocked the path to the low\-cost technology sold by Ceres Power today. Based on these patents, Brandon and colleagues ultimately set up Ceres Power Ltd. in 2001.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 All of the impact described in this section is based on the underpinning research in Section 2, which focuses on the reduction of emissions in the transport sector. The establishment of companies and key partnerships has resulted in the deployment of manufacturing capacity and job creation in the low emissions vehicle sector. 

1.  **Manufacturing aluminium panels using Hot Form Quench \(HFQ®\) Technology \[R1, R2\]** 

  1.  
Replacing current steel parts with HFQ® processed parts for car body and chassis structures achieves a weight reduction up to 40\-55%, resulting in overall, 20\-25% fuel saving and 28\-35% CO2 emissions reduction. Similarly, travel ranges of electric vehicles can be extended by 30\-35% \[E1\]. 

  1.  Spin\-off company, <ins>Impression Technologies Ltd</ins> \(ITL\), established in 2013 with private investment. Based on seven key patents and over 80 research papers including \[R1, R2\], it built the world’s first HFQ® production facility in 2016 in Coventry \[E2\], to exploit a market valued at potentially GBP10,000,000,000 per year for passenger cars alone \[E1\]. Over the past 5 years, ITL has expanded to over 35 people, 2 of them are our former PhDs. 

  1.  First commercial license granted to <ins>PAB Coventry</ins> \(UK\) in 2014, which is a Tier\-1 SME providing components for automotive and aerospace OEMs.  From 2014 to the end of 2017, PAB has produced over 30,000 high value components for Aston Martin and Lotus Cars \[E3\], which results in PAB tripling in size over a 3\-year period, employing 105 people in 2017 \(35 people in 2014\). This success was published by the Government on its website as a case study on impact of academic research on UK industry \[E3\]. HFQ has enable PAB Coventry to increase its income from GBP3,000,000 per annum in 2014 to over GBP9,000,000 per annum by 2020. The growth in impact of our technology continues to increase: orders for more than 100,000 components in 2019 is worth over GBP7,000,000 in total \[E4\]. 

  1.  ITL established collaboration with <ins>Gestamp</ins> \(Spain\) to scale the HFQ technology in mass market vehicle applications to beyond 1,000,000 vehicles per annum, and to establish 4 mass production lines in the UK with the direct investment from Gestamp \(Spain\) in collaboration with ender users, such as Jaguar Land Rover \(JLR\) \[E1\].

A joint patent between Imperial and MHI was filed and published in 2013 \[E5a\] and it received the ""The Best Innovation 2016, special award for best new technology"" of whole MHI group. This new concept volute entered large scale production in 2016 with an estimated production volume of over 2,200,000 units during the REF period \[E5b\]. Bespoke design of a compressor rig facility that for the first time recognises pulsating flow based on engine conditions. Two new compressor concepts for enhanced stability margin have been designed by Imperial’s Turbo Group and they are currently being patented \[E5b\]. 

  1.  <ins>Caterpillar</ins>: Concept for aerodynamically\-optimized turbine interstage duct, which has gone into volume production on the Caterpillar C4.4 engine, manufactured in tens of thousands per annum at Caterpillar’s Peterborough UK plant, leading to approximately 20,000 tonnes of CO2 annual reduction from 2019 \[E6\]. The group demonstrated for the first time how electrically assisted turbochargers can be designed to optimize boost assist and energy recovery \[E6\]. 

1.  **Intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells at Imperial spin\-out Ceres Power \[R5, R6\]** 

  1.  
<ins>Ceres Power’s</ins> SteelCell® exceeds key milestone of 50% electrical efficiency, around 70% better than that of a conventional gas engine and similar to that of a centralised megawatt\-scale gas turbine \[E7\], using intermediate temperature design developed at Imperial. 

  1.  GBP8,000,000 investment by Ceres in new blueprint manufacturing facility \(CP2\) in Redhill, UK and began production in January 2020, creating 60 new skilled jobs \[E7\]. 

  1.  Ceres completed joint development with Weichai Power \(China\) of a prototype 30 kW range extender system for electric buses in 2018 \[E8\]. 

  1.  Our research helped Ceres Power to win GBP14,000,000 worth of orders by the close of 2020, to grow the company since 2014 to one with a market capitalisation of over GBP2,000,000,000 \[E9\], and to secure long term licensing agreements with Doosan \(South Korea\) and Bosch \(Germany\) \[E7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research linking historic uses of cathedrals and visitor needs today, undertaken and disseminated through 3 AHRC\-funded projects, has: **1**. **changed national strategy, policy and guidance emanating from the key institutions overseeing cathedrals**, the flagships of England’s largest built\-heritage sector, welcoming 11 million visitors a year \[Historic England, Cathedral and Church Buildings Division, Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England, Association of English Cathedrals\]; **2**. **transformed attitudes towards audience engagement at over 40 cathedrals**, resulting in significantly enhanced visitor experience through new policy \(e.g. allowing photography for the first time and moving shops inside cathedrals\), improved signage, retraining volunteers, and using the experiential dynamics of buildings more creatively; and **3**. **enhanced tourism strategy and management in Canterbury and instigated major national cultural celebrations** related to the 2020 anniversaries of the death and translation of Thomas Becket \(Becket and London 2020, and the 2020 Year of Cathedrals and Pilgrimage\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **A.** The AHRC\-funded **'Pilgrimage and England's Cathedrals, Past and Present'** \(PEC\) \(GBP997,038, PI Dyas\) was undertaken by the Centre for the Study of Christianity & Culture \(CSCC\), from 2014\-17. It examined engagement with four leading cathedrals, Canterbury, York, Durham and Westminster \(providing varying historical, geographical, denominational, and social settings, and charging policies\). Combining methodologies from history, theology, religious studies, and social sciences facilitated assessment of pilgrim and visitor interaction with sacred places from the 11th to the 21st centuries, analysis of responses to cathedrals as sacred/heritage/tourist sites today, and co\-design of new ways to maximise visitor engagement. 

 **Eight overarching transformative themes were developed and embedded in practice:** 

 **1**. Recognition that great churches have always been multi\-purpose sites, with many competing activities, embodying diverse meanings for multiple audiences \[3.1, 3.2\] and that cathedrals need to adapt and apply historic strategies to visitor engagement today \[3.2\]. In the 13th century, Durham Cathedral built an ambulatory to allow pilgrims access to St Cuthbert's shrine without disrupting monastic worship. Pilgrims were enfolded by music and incense, enriching experience and enhancing responsiveness, demonstrating the power of the phenomenon the research team designated 'adjacency' \[3.2\]. 

 **2**. Pilgrimage experience and engagement with sacred places have always been multifaceted, involving spiritual *and* tourism elements, and varying according to season, place, and individual needs. Visitors today still experience a wide range of \(sometimes unanticipated\) responses to spaces within a single visit. However, cathedral staff and volunteers often fail to recognise that all visitors are 'potential pilgrims,' frequently 'labelling' people on entry, pre\-judging interests and responses, and failing to offer a full range of engagement activities to all \[3.1, 3.2, 3.4\]. 

 **3.** Medieval engagement with sacred places promoted experiences of healing and wellbeing and built community through shared experience \[3.1\]; these factors still matter to visitors today \[3.2\]. 

 **4.** Sacred buildings and choreographed movement around them were designed to communicate messages, shape experience, and stimulate a response \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6\]. Research on the shrine of Thomas Becket, revealing the ways in which medieval pilgrim experience was enhanced \[3.1, 3.2, 3.4\], is embodied in ground\-breaking digital visualisations \[3.6\]. In contrast, cathedrals today often fail to make spaces welcoming and engaging, while volunteers' desire to control visitors often inhibits or blocks movement and access; signage can also be unhelpful. 

 **5.** The centrality of sensory engagement \(including movement\) in creating response, emotion, memory, and transformation \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6\]. Much of the rich environment created by images, altars, candles, and other visual, auditory and tactile stimuli was lost at the Reformation, but PEC conferences and pilot activities have helped cathedrals to increase sensory stimuli. 

 **6.** 'Takeaways', such as pilgrimage badges and relics, have always encapsulated experience, created memories, and supported sharing with others \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]. Photos \(e.g. 'selfies'\) and items from cathedrals still carry great significance, especially if obtained inside the building \[3.2\]. 

 **7.** Cathedrals have always needed to generate income, including medieval pilgrim offerings. Today Church of England \(CofE\) cathedrals are debating the desirability and effects of entry charges. The project studied two 'charging' \(Canterbury and York\) and two 'free entry' cathedrals \(Durham and Westminster\) in order to analyse the effects on visitor experience, revealing that the critical factor is not whether charges are levied but the quality of welcome and experience offered \[3.2\]. 

 **8**. New popular interest in saints reveals opportunities for public engagement \[3.1, 3.2\], as in the case of Thomas Becket and his under\-recognised links with London as patron saint \[3.5\]. 

 **B.** **The 'Becket Connection'** AHRC Follow\-on Funding for Impact and Engagement \(GBP100,810, PI Dyas\) used the 2020 anniversaries of Thomas Becket's death and translation as catalysts to transform heritage, tourism, education and community engagement, particularly in Canterbury and London. The research team created detailed 3D\-visualisations of medieval Canterbury \[3.6\], showing the pilgrimage\-inspired development of the city and the connectedness of the historic sites within a single narrative. 

 **C. 'Engaging with Place and Managing Space'** AHRC Follow\-on Funding for Impact and Engagement \(GBP100,735, PI Dyas\) translated PEC outputs into new national policy, statutory guidance, management, and training, enhancing visitor engagement with historic churches.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has shaped national policy, changed cathedral practice, reconfigured tourist strategy in Canterbury, and stimulated major national cultural activities and celebrations. The research was prompted by the worldwide growth in pilgrimage \(200\-300 million undertaking ‘religious’ pilgrimage annually\); the social/economic importance of English historic churches to community wellbeing and tourism \(with over 30 million visits per year\); and the need of cathedrals to evolve new strategies to engage their growing and very diverse audiences. 

####  1. RESHAPING NATIONAL POLICY, GUIDANCE, DECISION\-MAKING AND PRACTICE 

 **Changing understanding and decision\-making** The national organisations tasked with conservation, development and management of CofE cathedrals are: Cathedrals and Church Buildings Division, the CofE department advising churches and government on conservation matters \( **CCBD**\); Historic England \( **HE**\); the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England, an independent panel of experts giving advice, evaluating and approving cathedral developments, and promoting best practice \( **CFCE**\); and the Association of English Cathedrals \( **AEC**\). All were partners in the AHRC\-funded ‘Pilgrimage and Cathedrals’ and ‘Place and Space’ projects and have incorporated the research themes listed in 2A and 2C above into policy and practice. ‘The research findings and collaboration have significantly changed understanding … in particular changes to and development of strategy, policy and guidance documentation around the use and management of space … and contributed significantly to real\-world changes in cathedral attitudes and practice’ \[Director, CCBD, 5.1\]. 'The research findings were … “gold dust”, enhancing our understanding of what may be permissible and desirable in cathedrals today, informing the statutory advice we give ... and shaping the new guidance. …For example, we have recognised the value people place on having sale points within buildings … This is a new insight for Historic England.’ \[Head of Places of Worship Strategy, 5.3\]. 'The role of CFCE within the national church is to advise cathedrals on care, conservation, repair and development … weighing proposals for change to ensure they are of a suitable quality and benefit. The findings of this research have provided us with a significant body of evidence to aid our understanding of the value and importance placed by people on these buildings and their experience of interacting with them. This has both influenced our thinking about how we approach proposals for change and has led to the development of a new CFCE national strategy' \[Chair, CFCE, 5.2\]. Related impacts include: 

 **Co\-production and publication of a major new national strategy for cathedrals** which permanently embeds research findings into guidance on contemporary visitor needs, visitor engagement strategies, managing and enhancing the use of spaces in cathedrals, and planning future developments. “Developing Visitor Engagement in Cathedrals and Major Churches: Welcome, Worship, Mission, and Space Management” \(December 2020:  [<ins>https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2020\-12/Developing%20Visitor%20Engagement%20in%20Cathedrals.pdf</ins>](https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/Developing%20Visitor%20Engagement%20in%20Cathedrals.pdf)\) 'embodies and applies key research findings' \[Director CCBD, 5.1\] and 'will now guide all cathedrals and major churches in their work and development of projects going forward' \[Chair, CFCE, 5.2\]. 

 **Co\-production and publication of the first national Cathedral Volunteer Framework** 

 The AEC \(Deans; senior clergy and lay staff\) has incorporated 2A and 2C research outcomes at all levels, inviting the PI to brief the Executive and successive AGMs; holding the first National Cathedrals Conference \(2018\) at which the PI/IO presented the research; actively disseminating research for cathedrals to use in strategic planning, and encouraging its embedding by use of CSCC as consultants \[5.4\]. Research findings have changed cathedrals’ understanding of what visitors seek and identified critical training needs for volunteers, leading to AEC creating the first national Cathedral Volunteer Management Policy \(December 2020\), bringing 'consistency and rigour to the selection, training and management of volunteers … You have enabled us to recognise, understand, interpret, and respond to visitor dynamics and this has been transformative' \[AEC Director, 5.4\]. 

####  2. CHANGES AT INDIVIDUAL CATHEDRAL LEVEL 

 The research was disseminated nationally and locally through conferences, detailed reports on Canterbury, Durham, Westminster, and York \(available at  [<ins>www.pilgrimageandcathedrals.ac.uk</ins>](http://www.pilgrimageandcathedrals.ac.uk/)\) and the long\-term embedding of research principles through consultancy, training, and heritage interpretation projects. As a direct result, cathedrals have implemented radical changes to policy and practice in visitor welcome/provision \(including delivery of interpretative tools and activities and use of space\), both at PEC partner cathedrals \[5.5\] and many others, including Coventry, Lichfield, Norwich, Ripon and St Davids \[5.6\]. Cathedrals have: 

 **better understood the history, architecture, and experiential dynamics of buildings** \[research theme 2.A.4\] e.g. **Lichfield** completed a GBP190,000 interpretation scheme with CSCC \(2015\-9\), featuring pilgrimage past and present. The shop was moved into the cathedral, enhancing the meaning of 'takeaways' \[5.6a\]. The PI and IO are advising on the re\-creation of the medieval Shrine of St Chad for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. ‘It is no exaggeration to say all our plans for future use of our building have been designed to be entirely consistent with the CSCC research and the findings' \[Dean of Lichfield, 5.6a\]. 

 **opened up spaces/improved signage** to encourage exploration and engagement \[research themes 2.A.1; 2.A.4\]. **Coventry** \[5.6c\], **Lichfield** \[5.6a\], **Ripon** \[5.6d\] **and York** \[5.5c\] are implementing changes to designation/use of spaces and signage as a result of project research. 

 **trained staff and volunteers to treat all visitors in a more positive/open\-ended way** \[research themes 2.A.2\-3, 2.C\] \[5.4\] e.g. **York** now treat ‘all visitors as potential pilgrims’ and use the project’s final report as ‘part of all inductions with new staff’ \[5.5c\]. **Norwich:** 'We have drawn the research into our training of volunteers ... and shared it with other churches' \[5.6b\]. 

 **increased provision of sensory experience and interaction** \[research theme 2.A.4\]; ‘cathedrals have deployed the findings in ways which have significantly enriched visitor experience, through broadening responses to those who come through the doors, improving management of spaces and enhancing sensory engagement’ \[AEC, 5.4\]. **Canterbury:** the research team co\-devised a 12\-station sensory pilgrim experience \[5.5a\]; **Lichfield:** introduced sensory engagement through new icons; candle lighting events attract thousands \[5.6a\]; **York:** held an interactive pilgrimage exhibition \[5.5c\]. 

 **embraced** **the value of 'adjacency'** \[research theme 2.A.1\]. The concept of adjacency developed by the research team \(encouraging visitors to explore the multiple sensory experiences which cathedrals offer in a flexible and gradual manner\) has been widely adopted. ‘The findings of this research have encouraged cathedrals to move services to more central locations so people can experience Evensong and other services more easily and accessibly. This has increased participation, especially amongst those who otherwise wouldn’t feel confident about taking part and made the central function of the church more visible to school visits … a significant change in practice which has enhanced both visitor management strategies and visitor experience' \[Director, CCBD, 5.1\]. **Norwich:** ‘Our most significant change has been to relocate \[weekday\] services of Holy Communion from side chapels to our Nave’ \[leading to\] ‘a significant increase in the numbers coming forward to receive Communion… others sit or stand in other parts of the Nave, clearly valuing being able to share in the service for all or part of the time’ \[5.6b\]. 

 **changed core policies on visitor interaction with buildings** \[research theme 2.A.6\]. **Durham** previously banned photography, but the research report to the cathedral highlighted its value in capturing experience and perpetuating memory. In 2019, Durham announced a major policy reversal. ‘The project’s findings that photography, both “selfies” of someone being in the space and the opportunity to take a picture of a candle lit for someone and send it to them, was a deeply meaningful and spiritually\-important part of the visitor experience, were very influential in the decision to reverse this policy’ \[Dean of Durham, 5.5b\]. **Coventry:** Responding to the PEC research \('You have given us terms and concepts for what we could sense was happening but couldn't define so that we can now act’ \[Dean of Coventry, 5.6c\]\). Coventry Cathedral employed CSCC in 2019 to create their interpretation strategy for their application for City of Culture 2021. This incorporates key research findings on visitor needs and sensory engagement strategies \[2.A:1\-7\], resulting in new approaches being implemented for 2020/21 \[5.6c\]. 

####  3. ENHANCING TOURISM STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT THROUGH SHAPING CITYWIDE AND NATIONAL HERITAGE CELEBRATIONS 

 **CASE STUDY A: CANTERBURY** Partners include the Cathedral, City Council, Museums Trust \(CMT\), Business Improvement District \(BID\), and Visit Canterbury. 

 **A new historically\-informed toolkit \(the unique 3D\-visualisations of medieval Canterbury \[3.6\]\) has equipped partners to create a more integrated Canterbury tourism offer,** enhancing the connections between the Cathedral, the City, and the rich multiplicity of heritage sites. From the Canterbury Cathedral CEO: ‘The research led to the digital recreations, and those in turn gave us impressive, impactful new tools with the energising power to transform our engagement on many levels, now and in the future, with multiple partners in Canterbury and far beyond \(including the city's civic, heritage, cultural and tourism authorities\) … These tools have fundamentally renewed how we tell our story to the millions, both from around the country and internationally, who visit this World Heritage Site, the Mother Church of the Anglican Communion’ \[5.5a\]. From the Visit Canterbury Tourism Engagement Officer: ‘This year we have developed a new marketing strategy and campaign, \#OurCanterburyTales … Having compelling visuals of the medieval city of Canterbury and the cathedral has helped inform this approach and is playing a key role in communications and messaging’ \[5.8\]. From the Canterbury BID Chief Executive: ‘The aim of our Destination Management Plan is to make Canterbury “a first\-class cultural heritage destination”, and the 'Becket Connection' resources help us achieve that. The project has been hugely beneficial for Canterbury’s cultural heritage offering and local collaboration’ \[5.8\]. 

 **Shaping the design, content and delivery of exhibitions/public engagement tools** 

 Greater understanding of the sensory dynamics of medieval pilgrim experience \(including animated digital recreations of pilgrims at Canterbury \[3.6\]\) significantly influenced exhibition design, planning, and content development \(since 2018\). Partner outputs, shaped by and incorporating research material \[2A\-2C\], include a permanent interpretation legacy \(touchscreens, hand\-held media guides, schools resources, web resource\) at the Cathedral \(part of the GBP24.7 million HLF\-funded project \[5.8\]\), and an exhibition on Becket and pilgrimage by Canterbury Museums Trust: ‘It has been invaluable to partner with the York team and receive current trusted research and knowledge on Becket which we have been able to reflect throughout our exhibition interpretation' \[CMT Programming & Collections Manager, 5.8\]. 

 **CASE STUDY B: LONDON** Major London institutions were prompted to stage significant cultural celebrations \(2020\-21\) celebrating Becket's influence on the city and its landscape, 'entirely as a result of the research and initiatives undertaken by Dr Dee Dyas and her colleagues’ \[Becket and London 2020 Committee Chair, 5.9\] \[3.5\]. CSCC initiated, informed and coordinated the London 2020 Committee leading to the ‘catalysing effects of the research undertaken by the team on Becket's relationship with London and of the resulting educational and cultural initiatives highlighting Becket's London roots and legacies’ \[City Remembrancer, 5.9\]. **Key elements include**: **1. Lecture/recital hosted by the Mercers** \(‘thanks to \[the\] imaginative and thorough research … the Mercers’ Company was able to commemorate suitably its association with St Thomas’ life and achievements \[through\] not only a spectacular and memorable event … but lasting and educational legacies of his work' \[Former Master, Mercers’ Company, 5.9\]. **2.** **Online resource**  [<ins>www.thebecketstory.org.uk</ins>](http://www.thebecketstory.org.uk/) \(drawing on \[3.5, 3.6\]\) with digital reconstructions, a new digital map of medieval London, History, RE, Literature, and Citizenship teaching resources \(Sample feedback: ‘I used your Becket website for teaching KS3. The lesson resources etc … are great. The kids loved exploring the site and I gave them a whole hour to use it’ \[5.9\]\); **3. British Museum exhibition**: Between 2017 and late 2020 ‘Project research, together with the vivid detailed digital 3D visualisations … contributed significantly to the planning, design and content of the upcoming major exhibition at the British Museum on Thomas Becket’ \[Head of Research, 5.7\]; **4.** **Museum of London Exhibition**: 'new research fed into the online content and ….helped us refine and enhance gallery captions and individual object records' \[Medieval Curator, 5.9\]. 

 **YEAR OF CATHEDRALS & PILGRIMAGE 2020\-21**. The research led to a second major initiative \- a new national culture/tourism campaign launched in response to ‘the excitement generated’ by CSCC research' \[AEC, 5.4\], showcasing cathedrals as places of shared heritage, celebration, commemoration, and community identity. Each cathedral is staging new engagement events including 'Cathedrals at Night’. The PI/IO co\-planned national training conferences for cathedral staff and presented research themes 2.A.1\-7. Impacts include changed visitor strategies, new activities, and a national Pilgrim Passport \[5.4\]. The PI serves on the National Executive and National Cathedrals Committee. 'Covid has necessitated the deferral of several events to next year but the policy impacts generated \[by the research\] …have enabled cathedrals to respond to these challenges in creative, imaginative and \(most importantly\) people\-centred ways' \[AEC, 5.4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Boron Neutron Capture Therapy \(BNCT\) has become a viable treatment option for the most aggressive cancers, with impact on **global commerce and the economy**, and on **patient outcomes**, because of our research. We directly contributed to **innovation and commercial activity** at the international medical equipment company, Neutron Therapeutics, which **developed a major new product** \(a clinical BNCT facility\). We provided companies with the confidence to **invest in and adopt** **new clinical BNCT technology**, indirectly **reducing risk** for the Japanese company, Cancer Intelligence Care Systems \(¥5 billion investment\) and influencing the **strategic investment** \($70 million\) of the multi\-national company, TAE Life Sciences, to expand its business into BNCT therapeutics. **BNCT has been approved as a treatment option** for recurrent head and neck cancers in Japan. It not only **improves patient survival** but also requires **less treatment time at lower cost** than other advanced forms of radiotherapy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research was the first to produce a clinically suitable treatment beam using an accelerator for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy \(BNCT\), a step\-change in the field. 

###  *Developing BNCT to safely treat glioblastoma multiforme, and head and neck cancers* 

 The potential of BNCT to treat otherwise incurable cancers has been understood for decades, but was never practical until our breakthroughs. Effective treatment depends on the interaction of a non\-toxic boron\-containing drug, which is selectively absorbed by cancerous cells, and a neutron beam. The challenge we faced was that only a nuclear reactor could produce the neutron beam. This was too expensive and hazardous to install in a hospital. Moreover, the beam it produced could contain high\-energy neutrons that might have damaging side effects. To make BNCT practical, the beam would need to be instead produced by a particle accelerator. 

 This presented **2 significant challenges, both of which we overcame**. 

####  **Key finding 1 \[KF1\]: Producing a safe and practical lithium target** 

 First, to produce a neutron field, we must fire protons at a lithium ‘target’. However, this produces heat that would melt the lithium if not controlled. Bonding the lithium with copper allows heat to conduct through the copper to water. This requires the lithium and copper to stay bonded under the powerful heating caused by proton bombardment. 

 We developed a new and powerful technique to achieve effective bonding of the lithium and copper and in 2004 demonstrated its effectiveness \[S1\]. The image below shows sections through an un\-treated Li\-Cu junction on the left and on the right a typical bond that our process achieves. Here lithium \(on the right half of the right image\) has partially diffused into the copper \(on the left\). This forms a strong bond which allows heat to be removed from the lithium while it remains solid under proton beam powers of approximately 3–4kW. **Before our work, this was widely viewed as an extraordinarily challenging problem that might never be solved.** 

 Image 1: L showing the untreated Li\-Cu junction; R showing Li\-Cu diffusion after treatment. 

####  **Key finding 2 \[KF2\]: Developing a sufficiently intense and less contaminated narrow spectrum neutron beam for clinical application** 

 Secondly, having produced a neutron field, we converted it into a beam suitable for treating patients, using what is termed a Beam Shaping Assembly \(BSA\). The combination of accelerator and BSA can be used to produce a narrower spectrum neutron beam, reducing unwanted high\-energy neutrons that would otherwise damage the patient. 

 In 2003/4, **we demonstrated for the first time that this combination of equipment would produce clinically usable dose\-rates** \[S1\]. We showed how the target and BSA had worked reliably over a period of months to allow characterisation of the beam by both physical dosimetry and a limited programme of cell radiobiology. This paper \[S1\] brings together our work to demonstrate performance of the lithium target and of the characteristics of the radiation field for patient treatment. 

####  **Key finding 3 \[KF3\]: Demonstrating greater protection for healthy tissues using the accelerator beam** 

 Finally, we developed an improved understanding of the biological consequences of the mixed radiation field delivered during BNCT treatment. This work demonstrated that the components of a mixed radiation field undergo a synergistic interaction that produces a greater cell kill effect than would be anticipated from the independent action of the different radiation types \[S2\]. We also demonstrated the **reduced biological effects of our accelerator beam** compared with the established Studsvik reactor beam for BNCT which had previously been used for patient trials \[S3\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Four international companies are now **producing accelerator\-based BNCT equipment** as a direct consequence of our key findings \(Neutron Therapeutics, Cancer Intelligence Care Systems \(CICS\), TAE Life Sciences and Sumitomo Heavy Engineering\). This has led to **economic and commercial impact** of 2 distinct types: \(1\) **innovation and new product development** at international medical equipment companies \(clinical BNCT facilities\); and \(2\) the **adoption of** and investment in **new BNCT** **technologies** at facilities around the world. The significance of these developments is further attested by the demonstrable **improvement in patient outcomes** shown in multiple clinical trials internationally. 

###  *1\) Enabling the development of a new product, a fully formed and bespoke clinical BNCT facility, by international medical equipment companies* 

 The medical equipment company, Neutron Therapeutics, **developed a clinical BNCT facility as its main commercial product** using the specific lithium\-copper bonding approach that we developed \[KF1\] in its manufacturing process. Its prototype has been demonstrated at 10s of kW of proton beam power for hundreds of hours run time with no degradation. Neutron Therapeutics’ Chief Operating Officer asserted that “The Birmingham team solved th\[e\] problem \[of physical and thermal bonding of the lithium layer to a suitable substrate\] for a copper target backing material and **we have followed this approach for our commercial product**. It is a critical aspect of our system and under\-pins the success of our product” \[E1\]. 

 The Tokyo\-based company CICS is a major partner in the **creation of a new BNCT facility**, using a safe lithium target design, at the National Cancer Centre \(NCC\) in Tokyo, Japan. The NCC is the largest specialist cancer treatment hospital in Japan and spearheads standardising cancer treatment in the country. Our demonstration that the neutron beam produced by a proton beam hitting a lithium target reduced damaging side effects \[KF3\] materially contributed to CICS’s adoption of the lithium target technology to create the facility. Its President and CMO commented that these benefits “convinced us that the choice of a lithium target was the right one for our project” \[E2\], significantly **influencing the commercial activity** and **strategic direction** of the company. 

 The development of these BNCT facilities are materially dependant on the work of the University of Birmingham team, whose research \[KF1, KF2\] gave the funders confidence such that, since 2012, the NCC BNCT project has received extensive and sustained investment. It took CICS 8 years to build the equipment prototype CICS\-1, at a cost of ¥2 billion, and our research \[KF1 and KF2\] served specifically to **ensure stakeholder confidence** and reassure investors that the final goal was achievable. CICS confirmed that our research **reduced its financial risks**: “The achievements of the team in Birmingham to produce a functioning BNCT system with a lithium target were critical for our project. They enabled us to provide the reassurance that our stakeholders required” \[E2\]. To date the **NCC has spent ¥5 billion** on the building construction and **BNCT equipment**. Following the success of the NCC BNCT project, CICS will deliver a second BNCT facility for Edogawa Hospital, Tokyo in March 2021. 

###  *2\) Through the use of BNCT, new clinical technologies, in the form of new therapies, were developed* 

 We have contributed to **innovation within the international BNCT community**, which has used our pioneering research findings \[KF1–KF3\] to **develop BNCT therapies**, with excellent efficacy. In addition to Neutron Therapeutics, which uses our specific lithium\-copper bonding approach \[KF1\], three companies, TAE Life Sciences, Cancer Intelligence Care Systems \(CICS\) and Sumitomo Heavy Engineering, **developed BNCT technology only after we had demonstrated that accelerator\-BNCT was possible**. Indeed, our research was described by the President of the International Society for Neutron Capture Therapy as “crucial in enabling BNCT as a medical therapy for incurable cancers. Motivated and inspired by \(our\) research, new accelerator projects have been initiated in Japan, Europe and around the World” \[E3\]. 

 The Boston\-based company Neutron Therapeutics, established in 2014, uses our lithium\-copper bonding technique \[KF1\]. The company employs 25 people. In 2019, their **first full clinical system was commissioned** by the Helsinki University Hospital team to initially treat patients with recurrent head and neck cancers. The facility has the capacity to treat up to 2,000 patients per year. A second system will be deployed at Shonan Kamakura General Hospital in Kanagawa, Japan, in 2021. The approximate value of each clinical facility is $25 million. In 2020, Neutron Therapeutics received an additional order for an accelerator neutron source for research in the UK \[E1\]. 

 Our ability to demonstrate the feasibility of BNCT as a viable clinical treatment \[KF1 and KF2\] impacted the **commercial opportunities and investment strategy** of the multi\-national company, TAE Life Sciences. TAE Life Sciences **raised $70 million** in funding to launch a subsidiary of the nuclear fusion energy company TAE Technologies in 2018 \[E4, E5\]. This significant strategic investment aims to commercialise BNCT with its accelerator\-based technology, making neutrons for BNCT more accessible in hospitals and hence indirectly providing better treatment for patients with incurable cancers \[E4\]. The company is supplying equipment to the NeuBoron facility at Xiamen Humanity Hospital in China. Construction of this facility is nearing completion and accelerator equipment is currently being installed. It will treat the first patients in 2021. In total, 14 facilities are in development or at clinical trial stage, in 8 counties around the world \[E6\]. 

 **New therapies are being developed using the new BNCT clinical facilities**, in which CICS has invested, exploring new indications for BNCT \[KF1–KF3\]. These include sarcoma, malignant melanoma and pleural mesothelioma \[E2\]. Because of the low toxicity of the lithium target neutron beam, the CICS team are actively exploring the use of BNCT in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The President and CMO commented that “I am deeply grateful to Professor Green’s prototype for guiding our developments” \[E2\]. 

 The Japanese company Sumitomo Heavy Industries has also invested in BNCT facilities for therapeutic purposes, at Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute and 2 treatment rooms each at the Southern Tohoku General Hospital \(Koriyama\) and Osaka Medical College. In March 2020, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare **approved the Sumitomo accelerator system of BNCT** as a treatment for patients with recurrent head and neck cancers \[E7\]. 

###  *3\) Demonstrable improvements in patient outcomes, treatment time and costs* 

 The **efficacy of BNCT has been demonstrated** by multiple clinical studies by research teams internationally. The benefits of BNCT take 3 forms: the first is **improved patient survival** \(points i–iii, below\), the second is **reduced toxicity** \(point iv\) and the third is reduced treatment time and consequently costs \(point v\). 

 **i\) Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme:** These brain tumours are both radio\-resistant and highly infiltrating, and while the incidence is relatively low \(around 4,500 cases per year in the UK\), poor outcomes mean that it results in the most years of life lost of any single tumour type. Clinical results from Japan show that patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with **BNCT could achieve a 2\-year survival rate of 50% compared to \~30% for the best available conventional treatments** \[E8\]. By extension, if all the \~4,500 cases per year in Britain were treated with BNCT, it would raise the number of patients alive at 2 years from \~1,350 \(with conventional treatments\) to 2,250. This can be extrapolated to the annual global incidence of \~200,000. 

 **ii\) Patients with glioblastoma multiforme that has recurred after first\-line treatment has failed:** For patients where the disease recurs and where patients are fit enough for a second\-line treatment, recent data presented by a team in Japan suggests that survival at 1 year following **BNCT** **treatment with an accelerator neutron source could approach 80% \(compared with an expectation of \~35% with standard approaches\)** \[E9\]. This is a huge difference. 

 **iii\) Patients with head and neck cancers that have recurred after first\-line treatment has failed:** In the UK, around 12,000 patients are diagnosed with head and neck cancers each year and \~45% of these will suffer a relapse within 5 years of treatment. Conventional treatments are often so toxic that clinicians are reluctant to repeat them and so offer patients only palliative treatment and pain relief. In some regions of China, the incidence of these cancers is dramatically higher than in the UK. Trial data from Helsinki \[E10\] has inspired many centres, including a number of those above, to pursue BNCT. Further analysis from the Helsinki team, published in 2019 showed **\~46% of patients with recurrent cancers in the head and neck to have survived 2 years following BNCT treatment and over 20% surviving 5 years** \[E11\]. 

 **iv\) Reduced toxicity:** Unlike many existing treatments, BNCT shows both good disease control and low toxicity for patients with head and neck cancers. That means that BNCT can be used safely following intensive first\-line treatment and can even be repeated multiple times should the disease recur \(Kato *et al*. where BNCT treatment was repeated 3 times for 1 patient \[E12\]\). Accelerator BNCT is even less damaging to healthy tissues \[KF3\] than is demonstrated in these studies which are based on neutron beams from nuclear reactors. 

 **v\) Reducing treatment time and costs:** The overall **benefits of using BNCT over conventional proton radiotherapy treatments** are considerable. A single BNCT treatment room costs the same as a single\-room proton radiotherapy facility \(approximately $25 million\), but can treat substantially more patients. Patients undergoing BNCT only require 1 or 2 or treatment sessions \(as opposed to between 5 and 30 for proton radiotherapy\) and each session only takes between 20 and 30 minutes. This means that each facility has the **capacity to treat at least \~6 times more patients per year**, \~2,000 in total \[E1\]. **This simultaneously cuts capital\-cost\-per\-patient significantly and provides better clinical outcomes** than are possible with protons. Neutron Therapeutics confirmed that “\[i\]t is our view that this cost\-effectiveness, combined with the potential to improve outcomes for patients, will lead to a significant expansion in BNCT treatment capacity in the coming years” \[E1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 John Gash’s research on Caravaggism has generated significant cultural value through international exhibitions, raised the profile of Perth Art Gallery, and brought economic benefits to the commercial art market. First, his ground\-breaking discovery of a Caravaggesque work in Perth sparked significant scholarly and public interest. Now usually attributed to Spadarino, one of Caravaggio’s principal followers, the painting has been requested by major national and international galleries for touring exhibitions. This has boosted ticket sales, visitor numbers and revenues. Second, Gash’s connoisseurship has contributed to the commercial art market, most notably in the attribution of the newly rediscovered *Judith Beheading Holofernes* to Caravaggio himself, which was sold in 2019 for EUR100\-150,000,000. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 John Gash is one of the world’s leading authorities on Caravaggio and his followers. His connoisseurship is internationally recognised, and he has published extensively on Caravaggism throughout his career. Gash’s expert understanding of the origin and context of these works, and forensic analysis of form, brushwork and canvas, allows him to deduce painterly idiosyncrasies and reveal authorship. Coupled with his understanding of scientific techniques, this work has been central to the attribution of several important paintings, by Caravaggio himself and by his followers. These attributions have created both cultural and economic benefits. 

 In 2009, Gash was the first to publish a highly accomplished, anonymous Caravaggesque work entitled *Christ Displaying His Wounds*, held within the collections of Perth Art Gallery and Museum \(PAGM\). Nothing was known about the painting when it entered the collection in 1861, and it had subsequently been recognised as a seventeenth\-century Italian work, but with no clear artist. Struck by the similarities to Caravaggio, which the work presented, and through appreciation of subtle details and comparison with firmly\-attributed works, Gash considered several artists of the Caravaggist school as potential authors, noting that firmer attribution would be possible if the painting was cleaned \[1\]. In 2012, PAGM was awarded a Woodmansterne Art Conservation Award to clean the painting, which allowed it to be removed from storage and permanently displayed prominently in PAGM from August 2013. 

 Gash’s groundbreaking discovery highlighted the work’s international importance and sparked significant scholarly debate, to which Gash has further contributed \[2\]. The difficulties attendant on pinning down the artist intrigued both curators and the general public and, following its cleaning, many commentators now agree that the *Perth Christ* can be attributed to Giovanni Antonio Galli, one of Caravaggio’s principal followers otherwise known as Spadarino, and that it is a significant and high quality example of his art. It has been included in several major exhibitions, including *Beyond Caravaggio* \(London, Edinburgh, Dublin\), *Utrecht, Caravaggio and Europe* \(Utrecht, Munich\) and *Caravaggio and Bernini* \(Vienna\). 

 Gash’s monograph on Caravaggio himself \[3\], and further work on Caravaggio and his followers, have cemented Gash’s global reputation for an unsurpassed ‘connoisseurial eye’, exemplified by his 2015 article reattributing the *Incredulity of St Thomas*, previously associated with Caravaggio or Ribera, to Spadarino \[4\]. 

 In 2014 Gash was central to the scholarly debate around the rediscovery in Toulouse of Caravaggio’s *Judith Beheading Holofernes*, the whereabouts of which were last recorded in the seventeenth century. Having been invited to authenticate the painting on the basis of his considerable expertise Gash was the first to publish research confirming the attribution \[5\]. His findings were integral to the sale of the picture as described below.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 John Gash’s research on Caravaggism has raised the profile of Perth Museum and Art Gallery through enhanced interpretation and increased recognition, generated significant cultural value through international exhibitions, and brought economic benefits to the commercial art market. 

 **Raising the Profile of Perth Museum and Art Gallery through Enhanced Interpretation and Increased Recognition** 

 Gash’s ground\-breaking research on the *Perth Christ* has raised the profile of Perth Museum and Art Gallery. In 2014 Gash contributed to a film about the picture, *The Perth Christ. Discovery of a Masterpiece*, offering an enhanced interpretation of the painting and its significance. It was given a special screening in the Gallery and subsequently shown there on a loop throughout the REF census period, as well as being made available online \[S1\]. The film tells the story of the artwork’s rediscovery, and Gash guides the general viewer to appreciate the expert connoisseurly methods that enabled the scholarly discussion and eventual attribution to Spadarino, one of Caravaggio’s principal followers. As Maria Devaney, Principal Art Officer, explains in the film ‘I think this has been a fantastic opportunity for Perth Museum and Art Gallery, to be able to focus on one of the many treasures that we have here and I think the fact it has been such a focus of debate between so many different academics, it’s really put Perth Museum on the map and really highlighted the fact we do have really important treasures here in Perth’. More recently Rhona Rodger, PAGM’s Senior Collections Officer, highlighted the lasting impact on the Gallery which increased recognition of the *Perth Christ* has had: ‘the painting has been in demand from major museums around Europe and the reputation and interest in the work is steadily growing. I believe that this is mostly down to the research you \[Gash\] undertook on the painting and its subsequent inclusion in the tour of the National Galleries in London, Dublin and Edinburgh’ \[S2\]. The exhibition was reviewed in *The Guardian*, with the *Perth Christ* prominently featured and credited, while one visitor to the National Gallery, London’s Facebook page commented of the *Perth Christ*: ‘Never knew this was in Perth. Will have to visit once it returns\!’ \[S3, S4\]. 

 **Generating Significant Cultural Value through National and International Exhibitions** 

 Gash’s work on the *Perth Christ* generated significant cultural value as the painting was exhibited in major touring exhibitions. It was included in the international exhibition *Beyond Caravaggio* at the National Gallery, London in 2016\-17, subsequently shown in Edinburgh and Dublin. The former’s press release described the *Perth Christ* as ‘one of the most striking and memorable paintings in the show’, and it was used heavily in publicity \[S5\]. Visitor numbers reached 191,661, exceeding targets by a ‘significant margin’ and making a ‘positive net contribution to the National Gallery, London’s financial position’ \[S5\]. Similarly, the National Gallery of Scotland’s exhibition was reported as the ‘highlight of the summer season’ for 2017, and in that year annual visits were 1,601,433, exceeding target by 41,433 \[S6\]. It was exhibited in major Caravaggio exhibitions in the Centraal Museum, Utrecht, and the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, in 2018\-19. The former was attended by 110,000 visitors, making it the most popular exhibition at the Centraal Museum since its foundation in 1838 \[S7\]. It also formed part of the *Caravaggio & Bernini* exhibition at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna \(October 2019\-January 2020\) and at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam \(February\-June 2020\). 

 **Generating Economic Benefits to the Commercial Art Market** 

 Gash’s research has made him a consultant to international auction houses, including Sotheby’s and the Dorotheum, Vienna. Jacques Leegenhoek, Paris\-based art dealer and former Old Master Specialist at Sotheby’s, explains that ‘the impact of his research is clearly important for the market: several international auction houses regularly send him photos of difficult cases to get his opinion’ \[S8\].Gash was one of the first experts to be called to examine the newly rediscovered *Judith Beheading Holofernes* in Toulouse in 2014 and was the first to publish a research article endorsing it as a work by Caravaggio \[S9, 5\]. Old Master expert and Paris\-based gallery owner Eric Turquin, through whom the sale was organised, explained the contribution of Gash’s research: ‘John Gash has been essential in attributing and asserting the Toulouse picture to Caravaggio… his monumental article in the *Burlington Magazine* in September has been instrumental in establishing the status of the picture as a new and major original by the artist’ \[S8\]. The painting was scheduled to be auctioned on 27 June 2019 at the Halle aux Grains in Toulouse but was instead sold by private treaty two days before this, for an estimated EUR100\-150,000,000 \[S10\]. Gash appeared in the documentary *L’Affaire Caravage*, screened to European audiences on the cultural programming channel ARTE on 23 February 2020, explaining his attribution. Frederic Biamonte, the director, stated that ‘John Gash appears in my film as the main supporter of the attribution to Caravaggio… his arguments were the most convincing…and \[his\] sequence is now one of the best pieces in the documentary \[S11\]. Purchased by the American billionaire J. Tomilson Hill, a board member of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, it is expected that the picture will be placed on long term loan to this or another major gallery, although future timelines are unclear given the ongoing COVID\-19 situation.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Warwick led to development of the  [EPOCH](https://epochpic.github.io/) \(Extendable PIC Open Collaboration\) open source software package.  EPOCH is used by the Atomic Weapons Establishment \(AWE\) in its work to support the UK’s nuclear deterrent and national security.  For AWE, EPOCH is an important component of its experimental planning, and its use represents an estimated saving of GBP2,500,000 to the organisation.  The package is also used by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(DSTL\) enabling important simulations which de\-risk the organisation’s activities. In all, the software has more than 1,400 users, including high\-tech SMEs such as Fluid Gravity Engineering Ltd which has saved GBP100,000 on development and GBP10,000 annual maintenance costs.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 At the 2007 European Physical Society Plasma Physics meeting in Warsaw, it became clear that UK academics were being hindered by their lack of access to plasma kinetic simulation codes – so called particle\-in\-cell \(PIC\) codes.  These were in widespread use in the US and European laboratories outside the UK; however, these codes were not open access and UK research was restricted to ad\-hoc collaborations with overseas code developers.  We had neither control over this code development nor the opportunity to lead the advancements in algorithm design required for the next generation of laser\-plasma facilities or laser\-driven fusion. 

 Preparatory work began at Warwick in 2007 on the core, classical PIC algorithm which would be at the centre of EPOCH \(Extendable PIC Open Collaboration\).  This initial study seeded an EPSRC grant, starting 2010, led by Warwick and included Oxford and Imperial.  The code design was chosen to allow use across all applications, e.g. laser\-plasma, fusion research, laser\-solid interactions, QED\-plasmas; as a result, the code also covered the feature sets needed by industry. 

 The key innovation implemented in EPOCH, and absent in other kinetic codes worldwide, were its extension as a multi\-physics and multi\-scale code.  The multi\-physics extensions included collisions, radiation, ionisation and QED \(quantum\-electrodynamics\) effects while the multi\-scale extensions allowed the PIC scheme to be pushed to smaller scales \(QED\) and at the other extreme towards fluid limits. The research that underpinned these developments was as follows: 

1.  *Computer science and algorithms*.  The core algorithm **\[3.1, 3.2\]** was designed at Warwick with modern data structures to allow easy addition of physics packages and particle manipulation.  A portable, self\-defining data format \(SDF\) for output data was developed to allow scaling to tens of thousands of cores. 

1.  *Long scale\-length, slow physics*.  Traditional PIC codes assume a collision\-less plasma; however, for both long time\-scale simulations and experiments with laser\-solid interaction this is no longer valid.  The EPOCH project has developed schemes for including relativistic binary collisions, as well has a hybrid scheme with resistive background fluids **\[3.2\]**.  These routines were initially developed at Imperial but have since been extended to correctly handle relativistic binary collisions by Warwick. 

1.  *Short\-scale, fast physics*.  Significant novel algorithmic development was required to allow the inclusion of QED processes **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]**.  This enabled a consistent treatment of non\-linear quantum\-corrected synchrotron emission, and the subsequent electron\-positron pair production through the interaction of those synchrotron photons with the background laser – the Breit\-Wheeler process.  Oxford and York developed QED physics tables that were implemented at Warwick. 

 The primary research that underpinned EPOCH was based on collaboration between Warwick, York, Oxford and Imperial, with additional support from AWE.  Warwick was the lead institute responsible for control of the source code, optimisation, documentation, training and core algorithms.  Warwick also led computer science related issues on input and output, data format and parallelisation.  The software had its first major, including QED and collisions, public release in July 2012.  Since 2016 EPOCH has been fully maintained and developed by the team at Warwick.  It is the combination of the novel physics packages and computer science related extensions that have led to the industrial impact.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 AWE \(the Atomic Weapons Establishment\) plays a key strategic role in the UK’s deterrent and National Nuclear Security. Its work presents significant scientific and technical challenges, which require the development and implementation of cutting\-edge science and computational methodologies. 

 The University of Warwick has had a long relationship with AWE, cemented by the formation of a Centre for Computational Plasma Physics in 2013. This strategic partnership was built on the development of the EPOCH massively parallel kinetic code, which has been actively used at AWE during the REF period, to help plan and understand laser\-plasma experiments; in particular experiments utilising the petawatt class laser in the ORION facility, sited at AWE’s Aldermaston campus. 

 The Orion facility consists of 12 high\-powered laser beams able to heat compressed matter to millions of degrees in nano\-seconds \( *Nature*, Vol 464, 156 \(2010\)\).  Experimental campaigns \(including 85% of the experiments on ORION\) are primarily in support of the UK nuclear deterrent and national security. These experiments are important in providing validation of data in the plasma regime to underwrite understanding of the performance of the deterrent and hence are central to AWE’s core business. 

 The Deputy Chief Scientist at AWE writes: “ *Over approximately ten years of integrated engagement between AWE staff and the EPOCH team, who are based primarily at the University of Warwick, the code has developed from a basic research tool into a practical and important component of our experimental planning, well beyond validation of EPOCH itself*. 

 *“The experimental campaigns are primarily in support of the UK nuclear deterrent and national security… These campaigns are important in providing validation of data in the plasma regime to underwrite our understanding of the performance of the deterrent and hence, are important to our core business.* 

 *“In parallel, this work increases our value to the US as worthy collaborators under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the importance of which cannot be overstated.’’* 

 The Deputy Chief Scientist estimates the equivalent AWE capability achieved unilaterally would have cost an estimated £2.5 to £3million \[GBP3,000,000\] over the ten\-year timeframe **\[5.1\]**. 

 He adds: “ *Without EPOCH we would not be able to develop or analyse these experiments on facilities such as ORION; it also enables us to innovate new experiments and engage on wider problems of interest with peers in the US National Laboratory complex, and with Universities. Progressing this scientific work not only strengthens our knowledge but our people capability to continue to support the Nation*.’’ **\[5.1\].** 

 EPOCH is also used by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(DSTL\) where simulations conducted in EPOCH allow an understanding of the physical properties of electron beams as they propagate through media over range which cannot be deduced by other means. 

 PULSAR Project Manager at DSTL regards EPOCH “as a benchmark model for predicting the performance of proposed future military sensing concepts”.  He states that: ""Had DSTL undertaken the development of EPOCH \[itself\] and paid for training courses, we estimate the cost would have been in the region of £560k \[GBP560,000\] and added 2 years to the project. Access to expert advice has also been extremely valuable and has saved us many months of wasted effort"" **\[5.2\]**.  He adds that “in the long term the project aims to not only provide step change military capabilities for the military, but also has the potential utility and cost reduction for civilian applications such as the oil and gas industry"" **\[5.3\]**. 

 EPOCH has more than 1,400 users in total, including high\-tech SMEs such as Fluid Gravity Engineering Ltd. \(FGE\).  FGE specialise in aspects of computational physics, with a client base spread across numerous sectors including civil space, maritime, oil and gas.  The data analysis and visualisation requirements of FGE closely match that of the plasma physics community so this was a natural industrial link.  As an SME, significantly smaller than AWE for instance, EPOCH has had a significant impact on FGE’s productivity over the last six years with the director of FGE commenting – ""The work undertaken in the EPOCH project has allowed us to consolidate some parts of our required code structure across the company, improving output and reducing our costs in that area. We have ten research scientists within the company who regularly use the VisIT and SDF tools in their everyday work. If the VisIT/SDF framework was not available then we would have had to spend… \[in the\] order \[of\] £100k \[GBP100,000\] to develop, and £10k \[GBP10,000\] per annum to maintain a similar capability. Linking to work under the EPOCH project has thus enabled us to concentrate further investment into application areas that expand our current contracts and customer base within the UK"" **\[5.4\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research undertaken by Professor Elizabeth Harlow has impacted upon the policies and practices in schools in England, as well as the universities, charities and local authorities that have helped to bring about the change. The research gave rise to the insight that school staff members were unaware of the principle that children’s early relationships \(attachments\) impacted upon their ability to learn, or make the most of their educational opportunities. This insight was taken up by the charity the Alex Timpson Trust \(ATT\), which invested £1million in: raising awareness amongst school personnel; changing practices in schools; and campaigning to change teacher training. Across England and Scotland, this money has been spent on the creation of: a consultancy post for Professor Harlow; training materials and accessible books; informative events and artefacts; support for associated charities and third sector organisations; and an action research project. Ofsted and the Department for Education \(DfE\) have also been impacted, as have professionals, children and families, as schools have introduced change as a result of becoming ‘attachment aware.’ 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning this impact case study was commissioned by the two charities, Adoption Matters and Caritas Care, that were responsible for the creation of the Centre for Adoption Support \(CfAS\): a pioneering service that offers support to adoptive families. Funding for the CfAS had been secured from the National Prospectus Grants Programme \(DfE 2012\). The research aimed to understand the problems encountered by adoptive families and the quality of the services provided. Mixed data were gathered from: organisational managers; professionals; documents; and adoptive parents. The project began in January 2014 and concluded at the end of March 2015. 

 The research explored the challenges faced by adoptive parents and their appeal to the CfAS for help. Importantly, the research revealed that the CfAS service was particularly valued in relation to schools: adoptive parents seeking help, and motivated to get the best education for their children, had found it hard to convince school staff members that their child’s biography and emotional needs should be taken into account. The school representatives who had been interviewed, said that teachers were not trained to understand how emotions might impact on the behaviour and performance of children in school. Social workers liaised with schools on behalf of families, and offered training on the needs of adopted \(or previously looked after\) children. This insight is articulated in outputs \[1\] and \[3\]. The value of attachment theory, in helping school staff members understand the ways in which emotional insecurity and anxiety impede learning, is articulated in \[4\]. The research insight appertained to adopted children who were more likely to have suffered abuse, neglect and loss, and were less likely to have benefitted from secure emotional attachments in their early years, which would have enabled them to make the most of their learning opportunities and cope in the school environment. Professor Harlow’s publications, which draw attention to this insight, contribute to a growing body of literature on this topic. Attachment theory and the ‘whole school approach’ requires leaders to maintain structures, processes, policies, and create a warm socio\-emotional climate that is inclusive, nurturing, safe, and calm. Building positive relationships with children and their parents, as well as understanding the meaning behind behaviours, is essential in enabling schools to function as a secure base for the ongoing development and learning of all children, not just the most vulnerable.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Impact by informing the direction of a new charity 

 In 2015, the research insight described above was brought to the attention of Sir John Timpson CBE when Professor Harlow sent him the final report \(Harlow et al. 2015, research reference \[1\]\). Sir John identified with the distress of the adoptive parents and the significance of the theme concerning children’s emotional needs in school. Sir John said *“…In 2015 Professor Elizabeth Harlow sent me her research report. As an adoptive parent myself, I could understand the struggle that was described by the interviewees in her study. I could also see that school staff in particular did not understand attachment theory and the emotional needs of children. I could see that this might be another area in which I could ‘spread the word’’ \[about attachment theory\]…*\[2\] Following consultation with Professor Harlow and other experts, Sir John committed the first five years of his new children’s charity \(the Alex Timpson Trust\) to promoting the awareness of attachment theory amongst school personnel, which in turn would change practice in schools, and ultimately promote change in initial teacher training \[1\]. The charity invested approximately £1 million in this initiative. Founded in 2017, the Alex Timpson Trust \(ATT\) \(Charity Commission number 1174698\) harnesses the fundraising potential of Timpson’s commercial outlets. Income for the financial year ending 31<sup>st</sup> March 2018 was £998.5k. The research insight, and the stated impact goals, further implicated universities, third sector organisations and local authorities. These implications and impacts will be described below. 

###  Impact on charities and third sector organisations that furthered attachment awareness in schools 

 Sir John offered patronage, and the ATT provided funding, to organisations that would support schools to effect change informed by attachment theory. These include: Nurture UK; Scottish Attachment in Action \[3\] and most importantly the Attachment Research Community \(ARC\), which was launched in 2017 \(charity commission number 1172378\) with the help of the ATT. \[4\] 

 Eight training organisations, as well as ARC, Nurture UK and Adoption Matters/CfAS \(the charity that funded the underpinning research\), were promoted in advertising materials that were written and circulated by the ATT, and representatives were invited to participate in networking events \(see below\). As a direct response to the research insight, Adoption Matters has developed its strategy and service offering, with 90 courses on attachment and trauma having since been delivered in schools and colleges \[5\]. The Chief Executive Officer of Adoption Matters said “ *The research conducted by Professor Harlow and colleagues at the University of Chester has helped us develop our direction of travel within CFAS and has resulted in many new and ongoing initiatives in the area of attachment and the development of attachment aware schools*”. \[5\] Furthermore, Professor Harlow has continued to advise and shape the organisation as she has been recruited onto the Board of Trustees of the charity Adoption Matters. 

###  Impact by the creation of a new post, artefacts, and events for the purpose of raising the awareness of attachment theory in schools 

 *Funding of a knowledge transfer post at the University of Chester \(£90,000 from 2017 to 2022\):* In order to raise the awareness of attachment theory in schools, the ATT has awarded Professor Harlow a knowledge transfer contract for one day per week for five years. In keeping with this consultancy role, and in order to help shape the work of the new charity, she was also recruited onto the Board of Trustees of the charity the ATT. 

 *Production of accessible publications*: 

 In order to promote the application of attachment theory in schools, accessible publications were produced. These were: 

-  Timpson, J. \(2016\) *Looking After Looked After Children* Timpson Ltd: Manchester. This book, which illustrates the principles of attachment theory and their relevance to children in the school environment, is available either free \(or a charitable donation\) in Timpson’s 2,122 commercial outlets across the UK, or free in bulk by order from Timpson House. 

-  Timpson, J. \(2018\) *A Guide to Attachment Awareness in Schools.* This publication contained adverts for the above charities and relevant training organisations. 

-  Harlow, E. \(2018\) Attachment Theory and Schools, *Headteacher Update,* Spring, 1, January, pp. 38\-39. This publication contained adverts for the above charities and relevant training organisations. 

-  Harlow, E. \(2020\) Attachment Theory and Children’s Learning in School, *Headteacher Update*, 1<sup>st</sup> June 2020. 

 *Information sharing and networking events*: There were four main events: 

-  In 2018, together with the virtual school headteacher \(VSH\) for Greater Manchester, Sir John hosted two symposia. Attendees included: 28 VSHs; 3 chief executive officers of children’s charities; 6 directors of attachment training organisations; a headteacher; and 2 regional representatives of Ofsted. \[6\] 

-  In March 2019, the conference ‘Navigating Adoption Support’ was mounted by Professor Harlow in partnership with the charity Adoption Matters/CfAS. Addressing the topic of attachment theory in school, there were 100 \(approx.\) delegates including adopted adults, adoptive parents, school personnel, academics, and social workers \[7\]. Feedback was positive, with indication that the content could inform changes in practice. 

-  In October 2019, the ATT funded the network organisation Scottish Attachment in Action to mount a promotional event in Glasgow which was attended by approximately 50 professionals, including educational psychologists. 

 *Creating information and training materials*: 

-  Webinars on the topic of attachment theory in school have been created and are available on the website of the Rees Centre, Oxford University \(see below\). 

-  The ATT funded the recording of Dan Hughes, an international expert on attachment theory. This artefact was made available for a fee via the website of the Scottish Attachment In Action with 70 recordings having been sold. \[3\] The fees benefitted Scottish Attachment in Action. 

-  On the initiative of Professor Harlow, the ATT also funded Professor Schofield from the University of East Anglia \(UEA\) to create and pilot on\-line training materials for use in schools. These are now globally available for free from the UEA website \(Secure Base in School\) \[9\]. 

 *Action research*: 

 In 2017, the ATT commissioned the Rees Centre at the University of Oxford to undertake an action research project. The project, costing £750,000 concludes in 2022 \[8\]. Professor Harlow chairs the Advisory Group for this project, with representatives from Ofsted and the DfE attending the Group. The aim is to influence initial teacher training and the auditing of schools. 

###  Impact by raising awareness and taking action 

 *Creating change through the consumption of awareness raising artefacts:* 

 Awareness is raised \(thus impact occurs\) when the above recording, publications, webinars and presentations are ‘consumed’ by professionals, parents, carers and children. *Headteacher Update* is sent to 25,000 primary schools in the UK. In addition, the two articles published by Professor Harlow have been viewed on\-line in total of 7,755 times. To date, 9,682 of Sir John’s books have been distributed. Written feedback confirms that they are provided in training events and have been made available: in staff rooms \(Cambs and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; Manchester Secondary Pupil Referral Unit\); to children \(Manchester Pupil Referral Unit\); to parents/carers in a reception waiting area \(Stockport\); to school staff \(Leeds City Council; Southampton City Council\); to carers via social workers \(Stockport\); in nurseries \(Stockport\); to potential foster carers and adopters \(charity based in Leith\); to looked after children and foster carers \(The Children’s Family Trust, Yorkshire Office\); to family support workers \(Carshalton\); and to Designated Safeguarding Leads \(Nottingham City Council\) \[10\]. 

 *Creating change in schools by means of the ARC*: 

 ARC \(as described above\) is a member organisation which helps schools to implement ‘attachment and trauma aware practice’. This is enabled by means of resources and guidance available on the website, and circulated via newsletters, regional workshops, and an annual conference. For example, an audit tool has been created that a school can use to assess its own performance in relation to good practice \(see below\). Each year the ATT prize is awarded to two primary schools and two secondary schools assessed as demonstrating the best ‘attachment aware’ practice. By June 2019, 485 schools had invested in membership of ARC \[4\]. The leaders of ARC, together with a representative of the National Association of Virtual School Heads, are currently campaigning to include content on child development \(in particular attachment theory\) in initial teacher training. Professor Harlow is a member of the campaign group. 

 *Creating change by training on the application of attachment theory in school*: 

 This has been facilitated by the ATT directly and indirectly. Organisations supported by the ATT have delivered training into schools across England. As a result of piloting the online training materials funded by the ATT, Norfolk County Council has commissioned training from the UEA \[9\]. The action research project at the Rees Centre has given rise to training on attachment theory in 262 schools. These schools are located in Birmingham, Coventry, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Kirklees, North Yorkshire, Oxfordshire, Rochdale, Southampton, Shropshire, St Helens, Stockport, Stockton, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford, Warwickshire, and West Sussex \[8\]. Continuing professional development training on children’s attachment and trauma has been delivered to 980 participants by the University of Chester \[11\]. 

 *Creating change in two urban regions: the case studies of Leeds and Manchester* 

 Using ‘Touchbase’, one of the organisations promoted by the ATT, Leeds City Council has rolled out training on attachment theory across the authority. Forty schools were enrolled as members of the ARC and Sir John’s books were being distributed. These practices were part of an overarching ambition to make Leeds a ‘child friendly’ city. As Chair of the National Association of Virtual School Headteachers, the VSH of Leeds City Council confirmed that attachment theory and relationship\-based approaches were influencing children’s services across England \[12\]. Resources from Sir John and the ATT were made available to the VSH in Greater Manchester in order that schools might become ’attachment aware’ and change implemented accordingly. These resources included: membership of ARC, use of the audit tool described above, a budget for the purchase of books, copies of Sir John’s books, a budget for training on attachment theory, and participation in a regional conference. Whilst noting that attachment theory was only one influence, four headteachers described to Professor Harlow the ways in which their schools had changed. A summary of the ways in which the schools had changed has been published in Harlow, E. \(2020\) Attachment Theory and Children’s Learning in School, *Headteacher Update*, June. Changes occurred in relation to: mission statements, values and school culture; policies and procedures; knowledge skills and the abilities of staff; and the roles and tasks of staff. For example, there has been a shift away from a policy of behaviour modification to relationship\-based engagement: instead of punishing unwanted behaviours, effort is made to understand and respond to the child’s underlying emotions. In addition to engaging with parents, children are listened to and all measures are considered in light of the question ‘what would this feel like for a child?’ Overall, there has been an effort to create a school environment that is calm and predictable, hence the potential for anxiety is reduced. Individual support for pupils has been provided and the emphasis has been on the creation of a respectful environment for all. 

 *Creating change: some examples from practitioners* 

 Written feedback to the ATT administrator also confirms that change is taking place in schools: 

 **Virtual School Headteacher, Shropshire**: *Through the Alex Timpson Trust we will be rolling out whole school training and network meetings for schools to look at practical strategies to support teachers. \(…\) We look after them so they can look after our children*. 

 **Virtual School Headteacher, Southampton**: *\[Following training, staff\] realised that it is not just about looked after children and it has really made them think about the importance of relationship\-based learning.* 

 **Headteacher, Rochdale**: *We have trained all our staff on attachment and have now put in place targeted interventions for our vulnerable children*. 

 **Deputy Headteacher, Watford**: *We are at the beginning of our journey to become attachment aware but are very committed to continue along the way. All our staff, not just the teachers have received attachment awareness training \(…\) We employ a TA who has a focus on Social, Emotional and Mental Health and from April 2019 we will be employing a 1:1 teacher to work with our most vulnerable students. This will include the CLA \[Children Looked After\], the children adopted from care, care leavers and those on a special guardianship order. \(…\) It is too soon to measure the impact on our young people but the staff are really onboard.*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Sophie Page co\-curated the exhibition *Spellbound: Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft* \(31 August 2018\-6 January 2019\), which drew upon her research into the history of magic and attracted 45,585 visitors to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Visitors gained a better understanding of the changing roles of magic in the past and examined their own habits of “magical thinking.” The exhibition attracted a new audience of 25–34\-year\-olds to the Ashmolean. A wall hanging created for the exhibition by Fine Cell Work improved the wellbeing of the prisoners who made it, and creative collaborations with artists Ackroyd & Harvey, cartoonist Hannah Sackett, musician Hayden Chisholm and storyteller Olivia Armstrong engaged audiences in emotional and artistic ways, and influenced the artists’ own creative practices.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The history of magic emerged in the 1990s as an increasingly important field of medieval history. Magic was practised at every level of medieval society and engaged the greatest minds of the time; contrary to a previous historiographical focus on crude superstitions, magic texts reveal medieval people’s syncretic, sophisticated and morally ambiguous understanding of their universe. Page’s ground\-breaking and innovative work has been formative and central to a new conceptualisation of late medieval attitudes to magic. Specifically, it demonstrates that some types of magic were viewed positively by monastic and ecclesiastical authorities \( **R1, R2, R3**\). This narrative of the “positivization” of magic has moved contemporary research in new directions and continues to suggest new fertile grounds for historical inquiry. 

 Until recently, scholars engaged only intermittently with the visual and material culture of magic to explore these questions. Page’s publications — and particularly her use of visual sources \(rather than texts\) to address key questions about belief systems — opened up new methodologies and areas of inquiry \( **R2, R4**\). She was one of the first scholars to investigate magic’s relationship with the natural world, demonstrating that the boundaries between God, animals and demons were relatively firm in medieval culture but that the border between animals and humans was more fluid \( **R5**\). Most importantly, Page’s publications have aimed to change our understanding of medieval attitudes to learned magic by showing that it was tolerated or even valued by diverse people and institutions, including religious insiders—though intermittently, and in complex, sometimes ambiguous ways. 

 Page initiated and co\-edited with Dr Catherine Rider \(Exeter University\) the *Routledge History of Medieval Magic* \( **R1**\). This important book has 34 contributions by academics from 11 different countries and includes methodological reflections and “future directions” sections in all thematic chapters. Page’s chapter demonstrates how magical figures are useful to exploring the relationship between image and text in learned magic and for explaining why some medieval critics identified magic texts as deviant. 

 As Co\-I on the Leverhulme funded project “Inner Lives: Emotions, Identity, and the Supernatural, 1300\-1900” \(2015\-2018\), Page collaborated with Malcolm Gaskill \(UEA\) and Owen Davies \(University of Hertfordshire\). Page led research in three significant areas: recovering and interpreting the visual and material culture of magic \( **R4**\); identifying how interactions with the supernatural revealed the emotional experiences and interior lives of medieval people \( **R4**\); and assessing the diverse ways in which cosmological ideas circulated in the late Middle Ages and stimulated the creation of new models to address questions about the nature of evil \( **R4, R6**\). 

 Co\-curating \(with professional curator Marina Wallace\) the major exhibition *Spellbound: Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft* at the Ashmolean Museum in 2018 enabled Page to expand her research beyond the Middle Ages to the modern eras. Page used contemporary ideas about magical thinking \(the belief that our thoughts or wishes may influence the world around us or that one event happens as a result of another with no plausible link of causation\) to make significant connections between ideas, emotions, practices and experiences of magic in the past and present in her contributions to the accompanying exhibition catalogue \( **R4**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The exhibition *Spellbound: Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft* \(Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 31 August 2018 – 6 January 2019\) enriched public understanding of the history of magic and the place of magical thinking in all our lives and pursued ways of using that knowledge for its psychological, social and creative benefits. Page led on creating the exhibition proposal, finding a professional curator to collaborate with \(Marina Wallace, Artakt\) and successfully pitching the idea of *Spellbound* to the Ashmolean. She had additional curatorial assistance from Malcolm Gaskill \(UEA\), Owen Davies and Ceri Houlbrook \(University of Hertfordshire\). The exhibition brought together more than 200 exhibits from the twelfth century to 2016 in an antechamber on magical thinking and three rooms focused on the medieval cosmos, the modern home and the early modern community. The medieval room, in particular, engaged visitors with Page’s research, demonstrating that medieval people had rich and diverse cosmological views \( **R6**\), positive approaches to magic \( **R3**\), and linked magical practices to their inner lives and emotional experiences \( **R4**\). 

 **Attracting a New Audience to the Ashmolean and Enhancing Museum Practice** 

 *Spellbound* stands out among all recent Ashmolean exhibitions for “ **reaching a wider, different audience**, a younger audience,” according to the Ashmolean Exhibitions manager and Co\-ordinator film \( **A**\). It attracted 45,585 visitors, surpassing the Ashmolean target of 30,000 by more than 50% \( **A**\). The Ashmolean is one of Arts Council England’s \( **ACE**\) National Portfolio Organisations. ACE stress the importance of museums attracting and engaging young and diverse visitors in their 2010\-20 strategic goals, which include: “Everyone has the opportunity to experience and to be inspired by the arts, museums and libraries” \( **B**\). Responses to the Ashmolean’s survey showed that the number of respondents who had never visited the Ashmolean before was higher for *Spellbound* than for any other exhibition for which data had been analysed. The data also showed a large increase in the proportion of respondents in the 25–34 age bracket, accounting for about 35% of the total \(roughly double the Ashmolean exhibition norm\) \( **C**\). 

 ACE’s strategic framework highlights the essential role of museums in “fuel\[ing\] children’s curiosity and critical capacity” and supporting their learning and creativity \( **B**\). *Spellbound* helped the Ashmolean to meet this strategic goal. *Spellbound* was seen by 497 school pupils on educational visits, and visitors included an additional 1,137 under\-12s \(more than any of the four preceding exhibitions\) and 3,610 12–17\-year\-olds \( **C**\). To facilitate engagement, Page produced a *Spellbound* Top 10 Trail teachers’ resource for secondary schools, advised on the exhibition family trail and ran a Saturday morning workshop for A\-level art students with artist Katharine Dowson. The Ashmolean’s Learning Officer called this “A fantastic workshop. The young people clearly enjoyed it, got a lot out of the session and made some really interesting work” \( **C**\). 

 Page and Wallace’s collaboration with the Ashmolean also **enhanced cultural heritage preservation and interpretation**. *Spellbound* involved more objects, private lenders and small local museums than the exhibition team normally deploys \( **A**\). The **benefit to local museums** included an “extra level of support” provided by the Ashmolean team of technicians, registrars and conservators “to enable them to lend” \( **A**\). Page’s new research findings on several objects \( **R4**\) enhanced their interpretation: notable examples included a seventeenth\-century ceremonial sword at the Ashmolean \(now recognised as a betrothal gift\), magic square talismans at the Pitt Rivers, a seal matrix at the Museum of the History of Science Oxford and an extremely rare magic mirror loaned by the Mathematisch\-Physikalischer Salon, Dresden. 

 **Enriching public, critical and cultural understanding of the significance of magical thinking** 

 Over half of visitors surveyed between 24 September and 22 November 2018 felt that *Spellbound* changed their understanding of the role of magic in the past. Page designed an antechamber to the exhibition with questions linked to her research on magical thinking \( **R4**\) that helped visitors to reflect on how, as a visitor put it, “we still use ritual and superstition as coping mechanisms for living in a complex world” \( **D**\). A key example linking modern and medieval magical thinking was love. Page collaborated with Ceri Houlbrook to create a display of medieval inscribed love tokens and modern love locks \(padlocks affixed to bridges\) based on their research \( **R4**\). One review \(on the website of the marketing company culturecalling.com\) termed this display “the most overwhelming evidence that we’re still magically minded” \( **E**\). 

 In the medieval room, Page showed how the creation of medieval images and objects was driven by emotions and by different ways of relating to the cosmos, as well as by creative choices \( **R1, R2, R6**\). One visitor acknowledged this, tweeting: “\[It made\] me think about our relationship with objects and the meaning with which we invest them” \( **F**\). Another responded with self\-conscious magical thinking: “John Dee’s crystal ball is something that I would touch alone but with people around me I would not touch just in case something did happen” \( **D**\) and others explicitly **reflected on the continued presence of magical thinking today**: “The presence of enchanted mirrors gave me a feeling of dread… and curiosity… Coming out of this exhibition, I reflected and asked myself: despite my apparent rationality, do I really think that differently from them?” \( **F**\). 

 68.5% of survey respondents felt that *Spellbound* made them more aware of magical thinking in their own lives; **visitors’ knowledge and understanding of human behaviour in the twenty\-first century were enhanced by their knowledge of its historical precedents**. The exhibition enabled visitors to understand the complexity of ritual actions: one commented that it was “important to realise that magic is not simply spells but is emotional” \( **D**\). In a *Times* review \(31.8.18\), Rachel Campbell\-Johnson wrote, “this history of magic is surprisingly moving… \[T\]he hidden presence of magic as it permeates our history and our human psyche is revealed” \( **E**\). 

 *Spellbound* attracted more than 98 reviews, features, interviews and blog posts in UK and European media outlets, **recognising the significance of magical thinking today and in the past** and extending the reach of the exhibition. In *The* *Times Literary Supplement* \(26.10.18\), Jane Jakeman declared that it was “an exhibition more intelligent and thought\-provoking than any big metropolitan collection has managed” \( **E**\). Sir Philip Pullman, the Carnegie\-Medal winning children’s author, wrote in *The Guardian* \(01.09.2018\), “I think this exhibition is full of illuminating things, and the mental world it illustrates is an important – no, an essential part of the life we live” \(4,910,000 hits and 3,933 shares in the first months\) \( **E**\). 

 **Enhancing prisoners’ wellbeing through craft in partnership with a UK\-based charity** 

 In collaboration with the prisoner rehabilitation charity Fine Cell Work \( **FCW**\), *Spellbound* displayed a specially commissioned wall hanging titled “Magical Thinking.” This piece was hand\-stitched in four British prisons by 12 individuals, based on Page’s research into medieval and modern understandings of human fate constrained by powerful environmental pressures \( **R4, R6**\). This had a positive impact on participant wellbeing in line with FCW’s objective to train prisoners in needlework “to enable them to build fulfilling and crime\-free lives” \( **G**\). FCW emphasises the therapeutic aspect of sewing: “Needlework provides a sense of calm and relieves stress as the needle becomes a tool to channel the inner – and outer – turmoil of prisoners” \( **G**\). 

 The FCW Design and Commissions manager reported that the most rewarding part of interpreting Page’s research was “seeing designs by prisoners who responded creatively, personally, with thought\-provoking images to the brief” \( **G**\). In a piece for the Fine Cell Newsletter \(Winter 2018\), “Remembering my grandfather through magical thinking,” one participant explains how his design featured a talisman made by his grandfather from an empty artillery shell in France, 1915 \( **G**\). Another stitcher wrote, “Within my Fine Cell piece is my journey… I’m more accepting of magical thinking in others \[after completing the stitching\]” \( **G**\). 

 **Inspiring and informing artistic practice leading to the production of new cultural artefacts** 

 *Spellbound* included major new works of contemporary art which were commissioned for the exhibition. Page and Wallace selected the artists and directed their collaborations with Gaskill and Davies between September 2016 and August 2018. These collaborations informed and enriched artistic practice, leading to the creation of several new artworks for *Spellbound*. Page’s own collaborations with artists resulted in **the co\-production of new art works which enriched artistic practice**: a sculpture tableau \(Ackroyd & Harvey\), an interactive music piece \(Hayden Chisholm\), a modern wall hanging \(FCW\), a comic book \(Hannah Sackett\) and a story\-telling workshop \(Olivia Armstrong\) **.** 

 Ackroyd and Harvey’s work *From Aether to Air* consists of an elevated crystalline human figure, a backdrop of angels and two small demons, which was influenced by Page’s research demonstrating how medieval cosmic models emphasised human agency in response to environmental pressures \( **R6**\). The **artists drew inspiration** from “our conversations about microcosmic man and this sense of being under siege from planetary forces.” Working on *Spellbound* with Page **influenced their choice and use of materials**: it “has pushed us to use different materials and to look at materials in a different way … we work intuitively so some of the things we’ve touched on with the knowledge from Sophie – it will remain there and influence work to come” \( **A**\). 

 Page worked closely with Armstrong \(five performances attended by 123 children and 140 adults\). Armstrong explains that “medieval magic… was something that I knew a little bit about, but not in great depth… \[Page\] had a real ability to disseminate that knowledge and make it very clear so I could understand it” \( **A**\). Writing about his interactive music piece, “The Medieval Jukebox,” Chisholm said, “Sophie’s work and research \[i.e. **R4** and **R6**\]… **informed my whole work, inspiring me** to create the soundscape and the composition… the jukebox itself really set some things alight for me as a composer and performer and I hope to use some of the ideas again” \( **G**\). Hannah Sackett’s comic, *The Magician’s Lament*, was inspired by the idea that magicians sought, and sometimes achieved, respectability, drawing upon Page’s research \( **R1, R2, R3**\). She notes, “I’ve benefitted artistically… I’ve worked with new images, new ways of drawing and creating page designs… it’s also leading me into other comics I want to make in the future” \( **A**\). 

 Page’s collaborations with artists continue to generate new ways of thinking and making. In 2019 and 2020, Page worked with the artist Annie Cattrell on a film, *Then in Now*, that is “intended to reappraise the continuity and timelessness of medieval thinking in the here and now” \( **I**\). The film compiles Cattrell’s “thoughts, imaginings and responses” to Page’s research on the cosmos \( **R3, R4**\) alongside Cattrell’s observation of Page’s “interpretations of medieval manuscripts at the Wellcome Library, London” \( **I**\). Cattrell documented the collaboration on her Instagram account, which has 1980 followers. In 2020, Page also collaborated with the artist Katharine Dowson on a sculpture in the form of a mirrored, glass heart, titled *Bewitched* that draws upon Page’s research on the multiple meanings associated with the medieval heart \( **R4**\) and the *Spellbound* exhibition \( **I**\). The planned physical display of the two works was prevented by COVID\-19 restrictions. However, Cattrell’s film and photos of Dowson’s sculpture, along with the artists’ descriptions of collaborating with Page, have been exhibited online since 26 November 2020 and were viewed 248 times in the first month, engaging a public audience with new ways of considering contemporary resonances of medieval magical thinking through creative practice.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University’s Child Computer Interaction \(ChiCI\) Group engages in pioneering research involving children in software design. It aims to address imbalances in respect to their participation in the creation of new IT products. The IT industry considers the participation of users desirable, however, because of expense it is often avoided and the use of children as participants is a rare occurrence. Our research uses inclusive methods to engage children in the UK and across the globe in innovative, collaborative and participatory design processes. This helps to raise the children’s career aspirations, gives them a better understanding and awareness of the software design/computer game industry and gives them a voice in the design of mobile apps and games. As a result of our work, the formal policy for the inclusion of children in participatory design, used by the Interaction Design and Children \(IDC\) community, has changed. This change has ethically informed and safeguarded children from commercial exploitation, benefitted the industry and enabled children to enjoy better software products.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The IT sector is a global market, and it is therefore important to get feedback from all users for the industry to develop and for users to be comprehensively represented. Our aim is to enable children, nationally and internationally, to be inclusively and ethically involved in the design of mobile apps and games. On this basis, our research is all open access so that both industry and users can benefit from our focus. 

 We use Participatory Design \(PD\) approaches \(as these are known to be effective in Computer Science to ensure users’ needs are met\) to facilitate this inclusive involvement. In 2002 our research employed Participatory Design in a new way when we facilitated and collaborated with a class of thirty school children to design a website for their school. In this project, we investigated, using surveys, retrospectives and observations, the effects of power imbalances alongside the communication and design skills of both the children and the adults. This positioned inclusivity at the heart of the project. This was one of the first uses of Participatory Design with children where an end product was developed \[1\].  The work raised questions about how to empower children in software development events so that they could be inclusively involved. The desired outcome of such empowerment is that both children, and the industry itself, can gain mutual benefit. 

 Since 2010, with some intervening papers examining design methods, and with funding from the EPSRC, we have been involved in a critical debate about the effectiveness of Participatory Design with children considering both methods and contexts. 

 Methodologically we have fully engaged with the ethical application of Participatory Design practices with children. The main challenge here was how best to convey to children the importance and the relevance of the permissions they had granted as part of the consent process. This is more than just obtaining consent from schools or parents it is importantly, about the children being able to comprehend how their data is used and how their participation might result in real\-world applications. 

 Read et al.,’s 2014 paper applied an empirical study to ideas generated by a large number of children, to propose a democratic approach towards the inclusion of design ideas based on two models \[2\]. In model one teams of children produce design ideas and each team selects one design to go forward for a ‘vote off’ final selection process. In model two all the designs from each team are included in the ‘vote off’ ensuring that no ideas are lost. This was followed by a 2016 research paper that empirically developed an approach that merged ideas from both adults and children \[3\]. This approach ensured the inclusion of the children, but also gave them accountability in the process. It enabled children to understand how their contributions became included in the product and thus they felt valued, enjoying a sense of responsibility within the design process. These two works have sparked debate within the Interaction Design and Children \(IDC\) community resulting in an annual ethics panel becoming a statutory feature of the Interaction Design and Children international conference since 2014 \[A, B\]. 

 A further facet to our work involves investigating methods to include children from outside the UK.  Several of our papers have considered cultural concerns in Participatory Design and highlighted the challenges of having children in the UK develop games for children from different countries. This work, which included a field trip to Uganda to test out UK\-based ideas, helped to change how the Interaction Design and Children \(IDC\) community thought about designing for children from Low and Middle\-Income Countries \(LMICs\) \[4\]. In particular, it highlighted that children could not effectively attend to the design of content as well as the context of a different culture. Thus, the paper provided essential evidence that children in other countries had to be contributors so as to create greater involvement with the product. This paper became part of a movement termed ‘Human Computer Interaction for the Developing World’ \(HCI4D\) and in 2013 Read helped to launch the theme of ‘HCI for Kids’ at the Computer Human Interaction \(CHI\) Conference in Paris. In the IDC community HCI4D is now being known as ‘Digital Development.’ 

 In our work on designing with children we have also sought to examine the contexts that are appropriate to them.  The project Research on Designing Cool Technologies for Young Teens \[5\] was funded by the EPSRC and was pioneering in considering specific design requirements for teenagers. This age group had been considered difficult to work with because of challenges of access, and the notion that their personal world can be secretive. The research provided designers with dimensions and keywords for ‘cool’ from a design requirement perspective rather than a marketing standpoint. For instance, ‘cool’ products could allow users to ‘rebel’ in the sense of being able to exclude adults. Alternatively, a ‘cool’ item might also be desirable because it represents authenticity owing to its high quality. It may also be ‘cool’ because it has ‘retro’ appeal through evoking some sense of personal or collective nostalgia. ‘Cool’ could also be innovative by appropriating technologies in novel ways and contexts. ‘Cool’ also means that the product is aesthetically attractive \[5\]. 

 Other work on contexts has focussed on the places where children may use technology.  Our work is based on creating effective designs for wellbeing and outdoor activity. Research by Cheverst and Fitton in 2017 developed a framework for building engaging outdoor mobile systems following field testing and using an iterative approach \[6\].

 <ins> **Impact on Policy**</ins> 

 The Association for Computing Machinery \(ACM\) conference for Interaction Design and Children \(IDC\) changed its publication policy as a result of our research and guidance. Prior to this there was no formal requirement to state the ethical practices within research papers involving Interaction Design with children. As a result, new guidelines have been incorporated into the conference from 2016. All researchers must now describe how ethical permission was obtained and papers can be rejected based on missing data around the participation of children in research \[B\]. Submitted papers must have a section entitled ‘Selection and Participation of Children’ and will be rejected if this is omitted. This has influenced the behaviour of researchers around the globe working within the area of Child Computer Interaction. The former Chair of the ACM IDC conference series \(2016 – 2018\) Prof Ole Sejer Iversen said: **“As introducing ethics as a concern in Child\-Computer Interaction, the ChiCI group pioneered our understanding of the fundamental ethics of doing research with children.

 Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child \(UNCRC\) states that ‘\[e\]very child has the right to express their views, feelings and wishes in all matters affecting them, and to have their views considered and taken seriously.’ Our research has enabled both industry and young people to become engaged with each other in the design of computer games and apps created for their use.  Our impact emerged from giving a voice to children and young people allowing them to contribute to the creative sector through participation in the design of computer games and apps. Such engagement provided them with a greater understanding of usability issues and stimulated their career aspirations. The ChiCI group have been working with National Curriculum KS2 children in local schools. Alan Brindle, Headteacher of Heskin Pemberton’s C of E VA Primary School, Chorley states: **“The children can take a pride in the fact that their opinions and input have had an impact on important studies and research in such an important field.”** The children **“had benefitted in a number of ways,”** and Brindle goes on to say **“Working with the latest technology enables our children to make clear links between their computing curriculum … and ‘real life’ applications.”** \[C\] 

 Young children are also invited into the university for ‘MESS days’ \(Mad Evaluation Sessions with Schoolchildren\). Children take part in activities that typically include evaluations of products, design sessions, small research studies, and purely fun activities. The MESS day epitomizes our approach to research and interaction design with children. It should be messy, inclusive, fun, fast paced and constantly refreshing. One child from All Saints year 4/5 produced a highly decorative letter of thanks \[D\]: 



 As a result of our visits and MESS days, schools have described a subsequent effect on children’s aspirations as David Bradshaw Computing Coordinator for St Anne’s Catholic Primary School comments: **“It is easy for the children to make clear links between their interests in computing and future educational and vocational pathways.”** \[E\] Joe Dryland, Head Teacher for Kirkham St Michael’s Primary School said that, **“Working with well\-respected academics had heightened our profile, despite being a primary school, as a seat of learning and education. Our school is seen as a proactive establishment in adopting technology and immersing young children in the possibilities that it provides.”** \[F\] 

 <ins> **Raising aspirations and worldwide collaboration with children**</ins> 

 Complying with Article 12 of the UNCRC is an ethical and moral imperative for the IT industry across the world. Ole Sejer Iversen notes the international aspect of the ChiCI team’s impact: **“Janet Read and her team … have had a remarkable impact on the international child\-computer interaction research since 2003. They were some of the first researchers to study and report on how children were actively engaged in the design of digital technology, and to state that children should have a voice in the design of children’s’ technology. Their research has provided novel prototypes, methods and techniques that has been recognized world\-wide.”** \[A\] 

 By involving children in participatory design, we can raise quite young children’s aspirations and increase their cultural engagement and understanding. St Anne’s Catholic Primary School, Leyland commented that the visit by the ChiCI group provided **‘clear information about career options in computing,’** and furthermore they were: “ **Giving the children the opportunity to experience using new equipment and technology and the chance to discuss the real\-life application of developing technologies. Often the children in our school are end\-users of technology and the … visits help to get them to think about how technology can be developed to serve a purpose rather than just to be consumed”** \[E\]. 

 A series of STEM enrichment activities in Clitheroe, Kirkham, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, Hanoi and Mumbai, working with children aged 5\-14, have led to the design of the Stones app. Stones is a project funded by the University of Central Lancashire to develop a mobile game suitable for children from all corners of the world to play. What is novel about the Stones project is that the ChiCI research team gathered design ideas for this game from children across the globe. The aim was to encourage outdoor activity, creative play and to facilitate an imaginative adoption of the app. The game also needed to be sustainable from an environmental point of view, and accessible to children regardless of their location and technology. Joe Dryland commented that, “ **From the perspective of the children, the benefits to their learning has been huge. Very few children would ever get the opportunity to develop APPs for children in other countries or support the development of future technology.”** \[F\] 

 Our research on ‘Cool’ and mobile design influenced the design of the Stones app to be effective and attractive to young people. The app provided a pathway for children to move from solitary indoor activities on mobile devices to outdoor face\-to\-face play with other children. Surveys carried out before and after the design sessions have shown that children are empowered by participation and their aspirations were raised. Collectively, we engaged with many children in participatory design. We met with children in the UK, Iceland, United Arab Emirates, USA, Malaysia and India, all of whom helped collaboratively contribute to the design of Stones. All the children who participated in the design sessions were invited to visit the Stones website where they could comment on the work to date. A boy aged 8 said: **“I really enjoyed the day and it is great that my ideas have been included in a game. I did not think i could help make a game for children like me.”** A girl aged 9 said, **“It is good that my idea is looked at and included in a game. I did not think children help make games.”** \[G\] 

 Assisted by our research publications in this area \[4\], professionals and organisations have adapted to changing cultural values within the HCI \(Human Computer Interaction\) environment. One example of this is the development of the Human Computer Interaction for Development \(HCI4D\) community. Within the HCI4D agenda, Sim and Read have continued to work and contribute to capacity building across Asia. For example, Sim in 2020 was part of the student design consortium for India HCI, setting the theme for the competition and judging students work. Whilst Read has also promoted CCI methods in Indonesia to academics and industry practitioners at several ACM UX Indonesia events. \[H\]. Dr Eunice Sari, CEO and Co\-Founder of UX Indonesia comments: **“Prof. Read has been an instrumental part of the HCI and UX community in Indonesia. Her method of design for the minor, i.e., children and aging people, is inspirational. Her down\-to\-earth and creative design thinking approach to work with the end\-users has bridged a lot of gaps in getting the best insights from the minor users to design new solutions to improve quality of life. Her research is very unique and pivotal especially during the Covid\-19 pandemic as she brilliantly mixes the fields of HCI, education, and design to solve problems.”** \[I\] 

 The Covid\-19 pandemic has disrupted the international work that we planned in 2020 preventing us from completing our work in the ways we had intended. We have engaged with over 500 children and young people in both developed and developing countries but, because of the ban on travel, it has been difficult to complete the circle with the children in the ways we would have liked to. Robust evaluations of the impact of our engagement have not been possible with schools and communications being so disrupted.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Virtual reality \(VR\) is a ground\-breaking technology in principle, but in practice most of its applications have been inspired by established cinematic and gaming forms. Goldsmiths' Computing Department has provided the milieu for a cross\-disciplinary collaboration which brings together visual art, software engineering and scientific modelling to create a suite of highly original VR experiences with deep and diverse social and scientific impacts. 

 William Latham and Frederic Fol Leymarie’s Mutator platform enables users to immerse themselves in experientially rich virtual landscapes, based on rigorous mathematical modelling of biological systems. This has led to the creation of a family of pioneering VR experiences that are evocative \(as art\), illuminating \(as scientific visualisations\), educational \(as models of biological processes\) and entertaining \(as immersive games\). 

 These have secured deep engagement with international cultural audiences, found significant real\-world applications in science and more recently attracted significant commercial interest. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 William Latham pioneered the use of evolutionary algorithms – those that mimic biological processes – in computer graphics at IBM's UK Scientific Centre in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The products of the FormGrow system were appreciated both as art \(exhibited in galleries\) and in popular culture \(via the ""rave"" scene\) but rooted in rigorous mathematical modelling by the biologist William Hamilton and software engineering by computer scientist Stephen Todd. Frederic Leymarie founded Goldsmiths' pioneering MA in Computational Arts and in 2005 invited Latham to present his work. That began a process of increasing engagement and collaboration which culminated in Latham becoming a professor at Goldsmiths in 2007. 

 **Computer art:** The initial focus was to reimplement, update and expand FormGrow, the result being the Mutator modelling and visualisation platform. Mutator has been used to create a range  of experiences with diverse applications, but which all allow their users to generate and explore limitless new worlds. **\[R1\]** These environments, and their simulated inhabitants, react and develop according to accurate biological principles. **\[R2**\] The initial screen\-based presentation was implemented as a series of immersive virtual reality environments from 2016 onwards.

| **Visualisation:** Because the system renders millions of points of scientific data into a custom model, controlled by a novel but carefully designed user interface using standard VR hardware, it became apparent that the platform could also support scientific visualisations if applied to actual biological systems. Latham and Leymarie, working with collaborators at Imperial College, Oxford University and the University of York, developed systems – FoldSynth and CSynth **\[R3,R4\]** – which give both laypeople and researchers an intuitive way to explore and understand the structure, composition and function of biological molecules, including DNA, proteins and entire viruses such as SARS\-COV\-2.  **Outreach:** The visualisation work found substantial application in public outreach, which became the focus of a subsequent project with Imperial College. Between 2013 and 2017, the partners developed BioBlox an educational game allowing laypeople to explore how proteins “dock” with each other, as well as 3D graphical tools for scientists. **\[R5\]**  This work was funded by a four\-year, £1m BBSRC grant and is now being expanded to illustrate the molecular mechanisms used by Covid\-19.  The common strand through each of these four areas of development is the combination of intensive data modelling, a novel interface and gamification, applied to both real and simulated biological systems. There is also a shared emphasis on cross\-disciplinary collaboration, rapid prototyping and development through iteration – a combination uniquely facilitated by the culture and objectives of Goldsmiths' Computing Department. **\[R6\]** Typically Latham works with collaborators to identify realisable areas of mutual interest; Leymarie supplies the mathematical modelling and Todd the software engineering needed to implement it. Releases are driven by outreach at public events, which allows feedback to be gathered and acted upon quickly, as well as attracting further collaborators. |

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **1: Large and diverse audiences for a new form of art** 



 *Image: Mutator VR Vortex exhibited at the Kinninji Buddhist Temple in Kyoto, March 2019* 

 Mutator VR allows users to create and explore virtual landscapes that are procedurally generated from mathematical rules and inhabited by organisms which obey biological principles. Each experience is unique as users explore endless worlds, unseen and unheard until called into existence. There are now several variants – Vortex, FormScape and Tadpoles – which explore different permutations of interaction with the environments and their occupants. **\[S1\]** 

 These new artefacts have been continuously exhibited at major international cultural venues. For example, during 2019/20 they were featured in public exhibitions at such globally renowned institutions as The Lowry in Manchester; the Pompidou Centre in Paris; the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, the Modern Art Museum in Shanghai. They have also appeared in numerous less formal locations, ranging from the Shoom 30 rave to the New Scientist Live science festival and the Kennin\-iji Buddhist Temple in Kyoto. **\[S2\]** 

 This has exposed the work to a far larger and more diverse audience than is typical for computer art. For example, at New Scientist Live, 2,300 people experienced MutatorVR for themselves, while its presence as an ""anchor"" exhibit with large\-scale projection meant it would have been apparent to all 25,000 visitors to the event. This is all the more impressive given the challenges of mounting such exhibits. 

 ""Taking VR artworks in exhibitions like the public realm festival Lightwaves 2018 and gallery exhibition The State of US \[at The Lowry, Manchester\] both have challenges. They both produce a high footfall of public engagement and the artworks have to adapt to high levels of audience interaction whilst also producing a rich artistic interaction for the public,"" says Lucy Dusgate, the producer at The Lowry responsible for Mutator's appearance in both these shows. ""Working closely with Professor Latham enabled us to jointly develop and adapt the artwork to address these key issues … We were particularly impressed and received public feedback that the artwork was engaging for all ages, social demographics and produced an accessible and seamless high\-quality experience for audiences. It effortlessly created a learning environment that captivated curiosity and encouraged broad participation in the learning."" **\[S3\]** 

 This appeal has proven to be globally applicable, even in cultures that might not be considered receptive to VR art. ""Asians prefer expression of the world so that it looks like nature in our real world rather than a pure virtual world. Therefore, it is a big challenge for \[Latham\] and me to exhibit the Mutator VR in Japan,""  writes Naoko Tosa of Kyoto University. Nonetheless, it was shown at Kyoto's oldest Zen temple, where ""interestingly and fortunately against our worry, most of the visitors … appreciated the exhibition. This means the worldview expressed by the Mutator VR is global and could be understood and shared by people over the world."" **\[S3\]** 

 **2. Illuminating visualisations help scientists share their research**

 Molecular biology deals in microscopic entities – proteins, genes, viruses – whose structures are enormously complicated and whose behaviour is radically unintuitive. It thus presents a challenging communication problem, despite its fundamental importance and applications in healthcare. 

 ""A significant outcome of this work meant we developed several high\-profile public engagement experiences with CSynth at the core. This work was initially funded by a Wellcome Trust Public Engagement award and called “DNA Origami: How do you fold a genome?” and resulted in worldwide coverage and exposure of our research to thousands of members of the public,"" says Stephen Taylor, Head of the Computational Biology Research Group at the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford. 

 Visualisations of protein docking and of viral structures have been shown to the general public at high\-profile outreach events including New Scientist Live, the Imperial Spark Festival, the Royal Society Summer Exhibition, the Cheltenham Science Festival and at the Crick Institute to inform public understanding of scientific research. Inclusion in these events is highly competitive and selected work must be scientifically rigorous while also accessible to the public. **\[S4\]** 

 ""The Virus VR set up to illustrate our latest research in the modelling of viruses based on our paper “Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle” on virus tilings in the journal Nature Communications in 2019 … has been very well received by the general public and has changed their perception of the importance of Mathematics in Virology as the feedback forms demonstrate,"" writes Professor Reidun Twarock of the University of York, including comments such as “A clear visual look at mathematical structures in biology” and “I didn’t know how important mathematics were in understanding viruses before I used the VR”. 

 ""Such outreach projects that are designed to change perceptions on the impact of mathematical research in virology are even more important at present in view of the current Covid\-19 pandemic, as they illustrate the contributions academia is making to the health sector, and highlight the solutions that science has to offer to society."" **\[S5\]** 

 **3\) Educational games inform young people’s understanding of how viruses work** 

 Bioblox is a free mobile game for young people, ages 11\-18, which demonstrates how proteins dock. Users drag, rotate and swipe to move protein shaped ‘jigsaw pieces’ around the screen in a manner akin to Tetris. This is an important problem in molecular biology and understanding it is key to developments in medicine and public health, as testified to by the £1m in funding granted to the project by the BBSRC. **\[S6\]** 

 
This topical game has been endorsed by games industry bodies Ukie and TIGA. The latter's CEO, Richard Wilson noted: ""It is timely to see Goldsmiths and Imperial Researchers using games technology to promote understanding of the corona virus, medical science and social distancing in a very novel way"". **\[S7\]** The game was rated the second\-best educational app for Android by Science Focus magazine in September 2020. 

 The collaboration's public\-facing, iterative approach to research and development has led to continuing collaborations with an increasingly diverse set of partners. For example: 

-  Showing the work in Shanghai led to a Visiting Professorship for William Latham at Jiao Tong University and the commissioning of a major ""Master Studio"" retrospective exhibition and lecture series, funded by JTU, to be delivered in 2020/21. **\[S8\]** 

-  Exhibiting MutatorVR led to discussions with the R&D division of hardware manufacturer HTC Vive. This has in turn led to a memorandum of understanding with the University of Maryland to investigate if MutatorVR can be used in pain relief for medical patients. **\[S9\]** 

-  Work done on virus modelling with partners at the University of York under a Wellcome Trust award is now underway to turn genetic information into musical notes. The objective is to create an instrument that will simultaneously play music and simulate genetic mutation, illustrating this important concept in an accessible way. **\[S10\]** 

-  Adding generative audio to the MutatorVR set\-up has created a compelling but highly intuitive creative platform combining sight, sound and movement. This has attracted substantial interest from major music labels and games companies and is being prepared for spin\-out as a standalone commercial company.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Burke’s research expertise was crucial to the success of *The Renaissance Nude*, a major exhibition at The Getty, Los Angeles and The Royal Academy, London. Attracting combined audiences of 229,514 and reviewed in over 25 international publications, the exhibition brought the gender politics of the Renaissance nude to new audiences in the \#MeToo era, generating impact by: 

1.  Inspiring new curatorial approaches towards Renaissance art that are responsive to topical debates. 

1.  Shaping public perceptions of the Renaissance nude and the understanding of its socio\-political relevance today. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Burke’s research focuses on the function, production and evaluation of the nude and the politics of the Renaissance body in the period 1400\-1530. Her contributions to the field lie in three areas: 

1.  Integrating the category of gender into histories of the nude; 

1.  Presenting new global and regional contexts of the nude; 

1.  New interpretations of the relation between images of the nude and the theory and practice of depicting human figures from life. 

 These insights challenge prevailing scholarship that treat the nude as an ideal, ahistorical category \(cf. Kenneth Clark’s *The Nude: A Study in Ideal Art*\) or primarily as a response to classical art. They prompt reassessment of the prevailing view of Renaissance art as a Western period construct detached from current concerns. 

###  Integrating the category of gender into histories of the nude 

 Burke’s research has prompted new ways of thinking about the nude in terms of period ideas of gender difference, sexuality and female appearance. She has investigated the function of the nude in Italian courtesan culture and linked the rise of the representation of the female nude in the early sixteenth century to new bodily ideals \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]. In this way, the research has exposed the differing receptions of male and female nudes. 

###  New global and regional contexts of the nude 

 Burke’s research has demonstrated how encounters with non\-European cultures shaped perceptions of nakedness within Renaissance Italy and how the depiction of naked non\-European figures reinforced ideas of European superiority following colonialization \[3.1, 3.4\]. Challenging the idea that the nude was essentially an Italian artistic development, Burke has presented the nude’s emergence as a pan\-European phenomenon shaped by regional artistic and religious ideas and patterns of censorship \[3.5\]. 

###  New interpretations of the relation between images of the nude and the theory and practice of depicting human figures from life 

 Burke’s research has disproved the commonly held view that female nudes were based on classical statuary or studies of male nudes rather than on the direct study of real women \[3.1, 3.5, 3.6\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 On the basis of her research expertise, Burke was appointed to the advisory committee for *The Renaissance Nude,* a major exhibition tracing the rise and development of the nude in the period 1400\-1530, held at two high profile museums: The Getty, Los Angeles and The Royal Academy \(RA\), London. Burke’s research contributed to the exhibition’s presentation of Renaissance culture as relevant to the way we think about gender and body image today. The exhibition attracted a combined attendance of 229,514 \(150,728 to the Getty – judged ‘highly successful’ \[5.1, 5.2\]; 78,786 to the RA\) and selling over 6,300 catalogues. It ranked within the Getty’s top 20 most visited shows of all time \[5.1\]. 

 The exhibition generated two key impacts: 

  

####  Inspiring new curatorial approaches towards Renaissance art that are responsive to topical debates 

 Burke contributed to important changes in the curatorial representation of Renaissance art and the way major exhibitions can engage with topical debates and attract diverse public audiences. Incorporating Burke’s insights into ‘broader historical and cultural factors and methodologies’ \[5.2\], *The Renaissance Nude* moved away from the customary language of idealism and triumph towards a multifaceted, historically\-situated contextualisation that spoke to current concerns. 

 The Senior Curator Emeritus at the J. Paul Getty Museum and lead curator for *The Renaissance Nude* confirmed that Burke’s ‘grasp of gender theory and deep understanding of social issues around the body’ were fundamental for the exhibition, offering ‘fresh ways of understanding Italian Renaissance art’ \[5.2\]. Her research also enabled the exhibition to speak to ‘contemporary audiences and helped to assure its strong attendance at both venues.’ Indeed, they highlighted Burke’s ‘ability to make her ideas accessible to a general audience’ \[5.2\]. Burke’s catalogue entries and catalogue essay were the basis for the wall texts and labels in the Getty presentation \[5.2\]. 

 The RA Curator described Burke’s contribution as ‘crucial’ to *The Renaissance Nude’s* ‘attempt to revisit Kenneth Clark’s seminal *The Nude*’ and its aim ‘to develop a more nuanced understanding of the different perceptions of the nude in Italy and Northern Europe’ \[5.3\]. They noted that Burke’s essay in *The Guardian* about Renaissance nudes and gender ‘helped to further clarify our curatorial approach.’ \[5.3\] 

 Burke’s research contributed to the associated public events at the RA and the Getty. Her work on life drawing generated new engagement opportunities for the RA – a four\-week ‘Drawing the Renaissance Nude’ life drawing course and an online \#LifeDrawingLife class. Public events at the Getty involved broad groups of public intellectuals and contemporary artists, discussing issues around the presentation of the body and gender in well attended events \(1,358 total attendees\) \[5.1\]. 

 *The Renaissance Nude*, notably ‘its reconsideration of gender and sexuality in early modern art’, fed into the conceptions of other exhibitions on Renaissance art such as *Giulio Romano: Art and Desire,* Palazzo Te, Mantua, 2019 – 2020 \[5.4\]. 

####  Shaping public perceptions of images of Renaissance nudes 

 Burke’s research contributed to new appreciation of the historical complexity and socio\-political currency of Renaissance nudes. It brought focus to the gender politics of representations of the nudes, ensuring that *The Renaissance Nude* spoke to topical public debates around gender, identity and body politics intensified through the \#MeToo movement. 

 *The Renaissance Nude* was also influential in placing nude within a global context, expanding audiences ‘beyond the usual aficionados of Renaissance and pre\-Modern art’ \[5.2\]. Burke’s research influenced the Getty’s decision to focus a study day on images of nudes outside Europe, which was ‘effective in bringing in local audiences of diverse ethnic backgrounds’ \[5.2\]. 

 As the representative of *The Renaissance Nude’s* curatorial team responsible for media engagement, Burke played a key role in bringing the research informing the exhibition to the public. Her contributions included a post on *Iris* \(the Getty blog\) and an article on the RA website \[5.5\], widely discussed interviews for the BBC Culture blog and the Radio 4 programme *Start the Week*, a public lecture at London’s National Gallery, and guest appearances on the arts podcast *Behind the Scenes at the Museum* \[5.6\].  A *Guardian* opinion piece authored by Burke drew 200 responses in a single day. This included support for exhibitions that challenge the ‘new puritanism of art in our own age’ and make ‘a genuine attempt at generating sober debate’ \[5.5\]. Burke’s appearance on the BBC2 documentary *Titian – Behind Closed Doors* \(aired 4 April 2020\) brought a ‘fresh take on the subject of Titian’s *poesie* and \[…\] the role of female models’ that revealed ‘the problematic nature of the subject matter, in contrast to more traditional views that focus largely on the skill of the artist’ \[5.7\]. 

 *The Renaissance Nude* received significant positive media coverage. As the Senior Curator Emeritus at the Getty noted, ‘all the key reviews that have appeared thus far \[….\] singled out Jill Burke’s contributions with praise’ \[5.2\]. Consistent across the coverage was the acknowledgement that *The Renaissance Nude* led to new appreciation of the nude’s complexity and diversity with respect to media, subject, geographical origin and function. The magazine *Apollo*, discussing the Royal Academy iteration, stated that the broad chronology and cross\-national focus showed the nude ‘to be far more multifaceted than one might have previously imagined’ \[5.8\].  *The* *Guardian* ranked *The Renaissance Nude* 13th in its top 20 exhibitions of 2019, calling it ‘thought\-provoking’ and ‘a jolt to the system’. It commented that ‘the exhibition shows us that the variety of approaches to the naked body is almost as diverse as the artists who depicted them’ \[5.8\]. *Frieze* praised *The Renaissance Nude* for challenging ‘easy narratives about prurience and prudishness in Renaissance art’ \[5.8\], while *The Telegraph* stated that it gives ‘a sense of the renaissance as way weirder and more complex than you imagined’ \[5.8\]. 

 *London Review of Books* commented that *The Renaissance Nude* ‘forcefully’ made the point ‘that the male and female nude have very different histories and significance.’ Critic Waldemar Januszczak’s YouTube video, which drew 2,573 views, highlighted the inclusion of male nudes: ‘by avoiding the obvious Venuses and nymphs, it’s a very fresh\-feeling show’ \[5.8\]. *H\-France* called it ‘one of the best full\-scale shows of Renaissance art in the last two decades’ \[5.8\]. Singling out Burke’s research insights into the use of female models, it stated that the show ‘is above all a welcome and important challenge to revisit the iconography of the gendered body today, in light of the importance of resisting forced gender conformity six hundred years later’. 

 Indeed, at least five commentators writing for international newspapers \( *The* *Art Newspaper*, *The Financial Times*, *The Times*, *The* *Spectator, The Independent* and *The Guardian* \[5.8\]\) explicitly linked the exhibition to \#MeToo, with many more noting that it drew attention to the role of images in shaping negative attitudes towards women, LGBT\+ people and other marginalised groups such as older people \[5.8\]. *The* *Times* described the Royal Academy iteration as a ‘definition\-busting, picture\-widening, sex\-upsetting, \#MeToo\-welcoming, ratio\-righting, image\-correcting masterclass of a display’ which ‘overturns pretty much every preconception about its subject’ \[5.8\]. Other reviews commended the exhibition for shedding unexpected light on broader intellectual contexts, such as anatomy and artists’ use of life models \[5.8\]. 

 The exhibition catalogue was also singled out for praise. *H\-France* noted that the catalogue ‘extends the impact’ of the show through its ‘transnational approach’ and praised the ‘genuine engagement with figures from outside Europe’ \[5.8\]. *The Historians of Netherlandish Art* reviewers called the catalogue ‘exemplary’ and that ‘most impressive is the attention to nudes both North and South, and assertions that not all major developments arose in Italy’ \[5.8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics \(IPAM\), with the Department of Physics and School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition developed and applied mathematical models to tackle infectious diseases in the UK and EU. Specifically: 

-  Our machine learning research underpinned action on human campylobacteriosis and informed professional debate on the source of human listeriosis in the UK and EU. 

-  We used compartmental models to determine progress of the COVID19 epidemic, understand role of asymptomatic cases in local outbreaks and predict outbreaks in higher education institutions. This informed the actions of public health teams. 

 Our research and advice contributed to food safety standards and embedding of risk assessment practice in the UK and EU.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Aberdeen team, led by Dr Perez\-Reche \(Maths \- expertise in machine learning and compartmental models\), Prof Strachan \(Physics \- expertise in Monte Carlo techniques and  quantitative risk assessment\) and Prof Forbes \(Medical Sciences – molecular epidemiology\) have collaborated to develop and apply mathematical methods to describe the transmission and risk of infectious diseases \(group website: https://bit.ly/2P9Iaho\). 

 **2.1 Machine learning methods** 

 *Campylobacter* is the most common cause of bacterial food poisoning in the world, with the European Centre for Disease Control reporting 250,161 cases in 2017. However, there is an estimated 9\-fold under\-reporting rate, resulting in 500,000 cases per annum in the UK alone.  Using a source attribution model, based on machine learning methods for classification, the team identified shop\-bought chicken meat as the main source of human campylobacteriosis \[3\]. This research has continued during the current REF period focussing on the Grampian region of Scotland, now incorporating whole genome sequencing using our state of art machine learning approach \[5\]. It was found that there was commonality of strains from chickens and human cases providing robust evidence that humans are contracting campylobacteriosis from retail chickens \[P1\]. 

 *Listeria* causes around 2,500 infections and 250 deaths per year in the EU. In 2014, the Aberdeen team, based on its *Campylobacter* expertise, together with Statens Serum Institute \(SSI\), French Agency for Food Safety \(ANSES\) and Public Health England \(PHE\), were commissioned by the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) \[P2, S4, S5\] to assess the value of utilising whole\-genome sequencing \(WGS\) in determining the source of human listeriosis. Aberdeen’s open source machine learning method \[5\] was utilised to analyse the massive datasets involved. The method, which relies on the Hamming distance between genomes to estimate the probability that a pathogen originates from a certain source, outperformed previous methods in terms of computational time for both *Listeria* and *Campylobacter*. Indeed, analyses take seconds rather than days \[5\]. The Aberdeen team identified that the main source of listeriosis was food of bovine origin but there were also contributions from other food animals, including fish \[S4, S5\]. 

 **2.2 Compartmental models** 

 In April 2020, novel compartmental models were developed that incorporated both reported and unreported infectious individuals in the COVID\-19 outbreak \[4\]. These models were used to analyse strategies to suppress the virus in exemplar countries. The research \[4\] provided evidence to confirm that: \(i\) more than 50% of infectious individuals were not tested for infection at the early stages of the epidemic, \(ii\) reducing the underlying transmission of untested cases was crucial to suppress the virus, and \(iii\) establishing herd immunity was not feasible during the early months of the epidemic. 

 In September 2020, the team used data on the incidence of COVID19 from across the world, together with student and staff numbers at UK HEIs in a stochastic mathematical model to predict that 81% of the UK HEIs had more than a 50% chance of having at least one COVID\-19 case arriving on campus at the beginning of the academic year \[6\]. Predictions for the number of cases expected at each campus were also provided. Based on these estimates, it was suggested that universities had to plan for COVID\-19 cases to arrive on campus and facilitate mitigations to reduce the spread of disease particularly during the first two weeks of term. 

 Furthermore, vaccination, as an anthropogenic mechanism for achieving herd immunity, was studied by extending the explosive percolation paradigm to develop “explosive immunisation”: a new method to inform targeted immunisation that enables the burden of epidemics to be minimised by vaccinating as few people as possible \[2, P4\]. The method assigns a score to each individual to quantify their contribution to the chance of a large epidemic if they are not immunised. Explosive immunisation targets individuals with a high score, who are called ‘superblockers’. These are typically well\-connected individuals who move between different communities and whose immunisation abruptly decreases the possibility of an epidemic. It is because of this sudden decrease of the probability for an epidemic that the method was called explosive immunisation. 

 **2.3 Monte Carlo modelling for food safety risk assessment and spread of infectious disease** 

 The Aberdeen team have applied Quantitative risk assessment \(QRA\) to food safety challenges since 2008. QRA is a mathematical methodology employing Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the risk of disease following consumption of contaminated food. In collaboration with the Dutch National Institute for Public Health \(RIVM\), they developed dose\-response models, a key component of QRA, for *E. coli* O157 under Bayesian frameworks utilising human outbreak data \[1, P3\]. The team discovered that there is considerable heterogeneity across the virulence of *E. coli* O157 strains but that ingestion of 100\-200 bacteria is sufficient for 50% of infected people to fall ill, posing a considerable health risk to consumers. Funded by the research councils \[P5\], the Aberdeen team used these models in QRAs of *E. coli* O157 from beef\-burgers \[P6\], private water supplies and direct contact with infected animals.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **4.1 Impact of Machine Learning Research** 

 **4.1.1 Research underpinned action on Campylobacter in the UK and EU** 

 The source attribution research on campylobacteriosis \[3, 5\] underpinned a joint campaign by UK food authorities and industry, which resulted in the successful reduction of Campylobacter levels in retail chicken. This is evidenced by the reduced prevalence of birds with >1000 cfu/g from 18.4% to 5.8% between 2014\- 2019 and hence improved food safety for consumers across the UK \(FSA *Campylobacter* Data Gathering Survey, 2019\) \[S1\]. 

 The Aberdeen team \(Strachan\) provided the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) with evidence \(as a member of the Working Group on Campylobacter in broiler meat – source attribution\) of the extent to which meat derived from retail chickens contributes to human campylobacteriosis \[S2, included for context\]. EFSA, as a result of this and in combination with its risk assessment work, issued advice on reduction of *Campylobacter* in retail meat production in 2011 \[S3, included for context\]. On 23<sup>rd</sup> August 2017 the EU commission regulation \(EU\) 2017/1495 \[S4\] was published which stipulated the levels at which *Campylobacter* may be present in chicken carcases. Para 5 of this document quotes the EFSA opinion \[S2, included for context\] which as mentioned above is underpinned by the Aberdeen studies. This regulation came into force across the EU in January 2018. Hence, the Aberdeen studies have been central to the provision of underpinning evidence for food safety regulation across the 27 member states of the European Union. 

 **4.1.2 Informed professional debate on the source of human Listeriosis in the EU** 

 The team’s work on *Listeria* source attribution for EFSA raised awareness of potential shortcomings in standard risk assessment methodology that pointed to fish products as the main source of listeriosis in the EU \[S6\]. Our work \[S5\] found products of bovine origin as the main source of human listeriosis leading to acknowledgement by EFSA that further work needs to be undertaken using a broader dataset, in order to ascertain additional sources of contamination. Based on this contribution, a team member was invited to present the *Listeria* work to the USDA – Food Safety Inspection Service in Washington, DC, as part of the debate on the potential role of WGS for health protection \[S7\]. 

 **4.2 Compartmental models have informed the actions of public health teams in responding to the COVID19 pandemic and the public’s understanding of spread of the virus** 

 In 2020, the Aberdeen team used their compartmental models for COVID\-19 \[4, 6\] to provide advice to Public Health teams in Scotland in three ways \(see testimonial \[S8\]\). 

 \(i\) In April 2020, the Aberdeen team provided estimates for the time dependent reproduction number, *R*, for Scotland as a whole and at the level of individual Health Boards. At the time when these estimates were provided, in the early part of the pandemic, the Scottish Government were not in a position to provide the Public Health teams of the NHS Health Boards with estimates of this important epidemiological measure. The timely estimates from the Aberdeen team helped inform the Health Boards of the progress of the pandemic and underpin the response. 

 \(ii\) The prediction generated by the Aberdeen team of the percentage of asymptomatic infected people \[4\] underpinned the scientific basis for the findings of the Public Health team investigation into the outbreak of COVID\-19 in a vessel that arrived into a Scottish harbour in April 2020. 

 \(iii\) The predictions of the Aberdeen team of outbreaks in UK higher education institutions \[6\] proved to be prescient and were made available to Public Health teams in Scotland, thereby raising the awareness of the need for response in educational settings to reduce transmission of this disease. 

 The team’s research on COVID\-19 \[4, 6\] and explosive immunisation \[2\] received considerable interest from the media and public, both nationally and internationally in different forms, including 1 TV and 3 radio interviews, over 30 newspaper and online articles and 5 public events, with attendees of 50\-70 people per event. Overall, the media audience is estimated to be of the order of a million individuals \(press coverage details:  [https://bit.ly/3qSrFUZ](https://bit.ly/3qSrFUZ)\). 

 **4.3 Research and advice contributed to food safety standards and embedding of risk assessment practice in the UK and EU** 

 Prof Strachan was Chief Scientific Adviser to Food Standards Scotland \(FSS\) from 2016\-2020. He led the development of a science strategy for the organisation in which risk assessment was embedded and presented it at an open meeting of the FSS board \[S9i\]. He provided advice on risk assessment to FSS on Shiga toxin producing *E. coli* \(STEC\) in unpasteurised cheese; contributed to a public information statement on STEC \[S9ii\] and gave a seminar to the FSS Board describing uncertainty and the application of the precautionary principle in the risk analysis process. 

 The Aberdeen team was commissioned by BTSF \(the Better Training for Safer Food training initiative from the European Commission\) to teach the dose\-response modelling section of the QRA course, based on their research, to staff from competent authorities \(e.g., food authorities\) across Europe. Four courses were taught \(in Berlin \(March, 2015\), Prague \(May, 2017\), Lisbon \(March, 2017\) and Tallinn \(May, 2015\)\) to approximately 20 attendees each \[P7\] \[S10\]. 

 The Aberdeen team provided advice to Aberdeen City Council on the safety of the cooking of beef burgers in 2016 \[S11i, ii\] based on risk assessment research. The advice resulted in the prohibition of the sale of rare burgers in Scotland. In 2018, a member of the Aberdeen team acted as an expert witness in the court case of South Lanarkshire Council versus Errington Cheese Ltd \[S11iii\], providing key evidence based on Aberdeen’s dose\-response work on *E. coli* O157 for the judgement.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Elnokaly addressing the importance of cultural heritage in urban regeneration led to her being consulted by a leading Egyptian property development company to advise on the redevelopment of historic buildings in Alexandria. The research also raised awareness of heritage\-led approaches to regeneration amongst policymakers, helping Egypt to address the UN Development Plan for Sustainable Cities and Communities\-2030. Three international workshops on heritage\-led regeneration were organised bringing together academic and non\-academic stakeholders. These resulted in new initiatives involving tribal communities in Aswan and Nuweiba. In 2017 Elnokaly received an Egyptian presidential award for women in STEM for her contribution to sustainable development in the country.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research was carried out by Elnokaly between 2008 and 2020. A catalyst for the research was the demolition of the historic *San Stefano Hotel* in *Alexandria* and subsequent redevelopment of the Hepastadion area in the city, which highlighted a lack of awareness and consideration of cultural heritage and the value of historic city centres in regeneration planning \( **R3.1**\). The new development ignored how traditional architectural approaches met the needs of locals, worked with the environment and added to the value and culture of the city. An analysis of regeneration strategies applied in the historic centres of *Barcelona* and *Istanbul* was carried out by Elnokaly \( **R3.2**\). She concluded that successful regeneration requires the adoption of a community\- and heritage\-based approach in which the essential character of a city is preserved and that governments and the public need to recognize the deep connection between historic city centres and their wider contexts. 

  

 Another study by Elnokaly focussed on the historic *Fouad Street* in old Alexandria via quantitative analysis of key performance indicators of people and footfall, diversity and vitality, consumer and business perception and Economic characteristics, to measure the development potential and character of the street \( **R3.3**\). It concluded that revitalizing downtown Alexandria required an empowering of its identity, cultural and archaeological heritage, promotion of independent stores and marketing of its unique Euro\-Mediterranean heritage to outside visitors. Overall, the importance of quantifying the economic benefits of heritage\-based regeneration is emphasised by Elnokaly and she argued that quantifying this dimension is particularly important in encouraging the adoption of conservation\-based approaches in developing countries \( **R3.4**\). 

 Elnokaly *et. al.* \( **R3.5**\) adopted a case study approach using six successful international urban regeneration projects that have been acknowledged through the Aga Khan Award for outstanding architectural projects in communities where Muslims have a significant presence. These were the *Al Darb Al Asfar* and *Darb Qirmiz Quarter* Projects in old *Cairo*, the conservation and reconstruction of Hafsia *Quarter and Sidi Bou Said Village* in Tunisia, and the restoration of Bukhara *old city, Uzbekistan* and *Hebron Old town, Palestine*. The study concluded that to maintain the sustainability of urban conservation the essential qualities of the historic areas and communities residing there need to be maintained. Public participation and awareness at an early stage of projects are essential and planners should clearly define project objectives by asking the questions *what* \(urban character/way of life\), *why* \(enhanced economic activity/tourism\) and *for whom* \(current residents/the country as a whole\) the conservation work was being carried out. 

  

 As well as analysing approaches to urban regeneration, Elnokaly’s research has also addressed the importance of cultural heritage in architecture for developing sustainable “eco\-tourism” strategies in rural regions. Elnokaly *et.al*. \( **R3.6**\) conducted an analytical review of vernacular architecture in the hot arid region of Siwa and recommended the climatic design of buildings using passive design techniques to provide comfort to the occupants whilst promoting and reviving the natural beauty and architecture of the Siwa Oasis. The development of well\-planned and ecologically sensitive facilities or “Eco\-lodges” in key areas of Egypt was recommended to support eco\-tourism.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Building on her research into Heritage conservation and sustainable economic development Elnokaly organised a series of workshops and symposiums attended by community groups, businesses, planners and architects, government officials and academic researchers to promote sustainable heritage\-based architecture and planning internationally. She also worked closely with Sigma properties, a major property developer in Egypt, advising them on a series of development projects and assisting them to develop a business model which integrates the value of cultural and heritage\-based perspectives into their commercial property developments. Together, these initiatives produced: 

  

 **Improved strategic engagement between community revitalisation stakeholders** 

 Two workshops were held in Egypt to bring together key stakeholders and researchers to work on developing ideas and frameworks for resilient development in their communities. These resulted in a better commitment to development programs and higher levels of engagement and interest from both communities and city council officials. 

-  **The International Workshop on Rebuilding Communities for Resilient and Sustainable development: Eco\-Cities** was held in Aswan Egypt in collaboration with Cairo University \(13\-18 December 2015\), supported by a grant awarded to Elnokaly from the British Council Newton Fund **\(G1\).** The workshop was attended by the Mayor of Aswan and representatives from the Egyptian ministry of tourism, the local Nubian Community, local craft guilds and business groups. Also attending the workshop were 44 international researchers from the UK and Egypt. 20 researchers came from 14 different Universities in the UK and 24 from 13 universities in Egypt **\(E5.1, E5.2, E5.7\)**. The key output of the workshop was a set of **specification of Key Performance Indicators \(KPI\) of Sustainable development in Aswan based on the UN 2030 Targets that were adopted by relevant authorities** **\(E5.2\)**. These were: Affordable and Safe Housing; Clean Public Transport; Greenery and Biodiversity; Safeguarding all Heritage sites; Improving Urban and Rural Links; Empowering Local Marginalised Groups and Safeguarding Local Skills. **\(E5.1\).** The workshop **led directly to the establishment of the College of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage in Aswan** **\(E5.4\),** which ensures the principles and KPI’s arising from this research are now followed in Aswan by developers, planners and ministry of antiquities on projects in Aswan to preserve cultural heritage. 

-  **An International Workshop on the Cultural Heritage and Livelihood of Bedouins of South Sinai** was held in collaboration with Ain Shams University in Cairo in Nuweiba \(20\-28th of October 2017\) supported by another award from the British Council Newton fund **\(G2\).** The event was attended by the mayor of the Nuweiba region, local council members and the head of the local Bedouin community, the local member of parliament, local businesses including 2 of the most active and oldest non\-governmental organisations in Nuweiba, the Habiba Community Farm and Basata Eco\-Lodge Resort, together with 40 academic researchers from 13 different UK Universities and 12 Egyptian Universities **\(E5.3**\). A key recommendation of the workshop was preserving organic farming and local skills of the Bedouins of the region; new resorts to be constructed only following Ecological strategies \(Eco\-lodges and Ecotourism\); expanding the boundaries of the city of Nuweiba to include the mountains where the Bedouin community predominantly live to transform the Bedouin’s role in society from ‘Powerless spectators’ to ‘Adaptive managers’. The findings were translated into Arabic and distributed to all attendees so that the findings could be applied to future projects. Habiba farm subsequently applied the findings of the workshop including through implementation of organic farming and providing support for education classes for their communities, they are also currently in discussion with Dr Elnokaly at Lincoln to sign a Memorandum of Understanding and raising awareness in Nuweiba **\(E5.5\).** 

 **Preservation of architectural heritage in property development** 

 Elnokaly has worked as a consultant to Sigma Properties in Alexandria where she advised their heritage property management section on projects reutilizing heritage buildings to turn them into key pieces of urban infrastructure. For nearly three decades Sigma had been acquiring unique Euro\-Mediterranean heritage properties in Cairo and Alexandria to become the leading developer of historic properties in Egypt. The framework developed by Elnokaly in collaboration with the company research team ensures that the economic revitalization of property never comes at the expense of architectural identity, learning lessons from Elnokaly’s project on “Energy\-efficient building envelope for low\-income housing in Egypt” **\(G3\).** Two key projects in Alexandria were Shelter and La Passage buildings on Fouad Street opened in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Elnokaly was invited to deliver a talk at the Alexandria Opera house entitled ‘Working with our Heritage’ and ‘Embracing the Past: Heritage and Identity; ‘The lost treasures of Alexandria’’ summarising the work she had undertaken with the team at Sigma. She was also given an award of recognition for her work with Sigma by the Managing Director of Sigma Properties **\(E5.6\).** In collaboration with Sigma and the Engineering Consultant group 3 workshops for early\-career architects on heritage\-based approaches to architecture were also delivered **\(E5.6\)**. In July 2017 in recognition for her work with Sigma and in Aswan and Nuweiba, Elnokaly was given the Egyptian President award for women in research for her contribution to achieving UN sustainable development goals in Egypt. 

 In addition to her impact on heritage\-based sustainable development in Egypt.  Further engagement activities on heritage projects have taken place by Elnokaly in Thailand where she mentored ‘the International Workshop: Water\-based settlements, flooding adaptation and heritage management in Thailand, in partnership with Naresuan University in Bangkok \(8th\-12th November 2015\) **\(E5.8\)** supported by a British Academy Newton Fund award.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 *Archeox  is a co\-produced university/community archaeology and history project that worked within the community of East Oxford, the part of the city encompassing some of Oxford’s educationally least\-advantaged areas. It has built new heritage capacity by involving and training over 600 active participants in steering and delivering all aspects of the project. *Archeox* has led to change in 3 main areas: 1\) on participants, including increased knowledge and skills, educational aspirations, careers, changed perceptions, awareness and inter\-connections within the community; 2\) creating a legacy of several hundred trained volunteers that continue to support local heritage through involvement in other archaeology and heritage projects and 3\) on local planning and management strategies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 *Archeox  was initiated by David Griffiths, a landscape archaeologist with an established interest in urban peripheries **\[R1\]**, who is a resident of East Oxford and sits on Oxfordshire City and County Archaeological Forum, as well as the Director of Studies for Archaeology at the University of Oxford’s Department for Continuing Education. It arose because of interest in the untapped archaeological research potential of the landscape of suburban East Oxford, coupled with a need to improve university engagement in research, education and learning across Oxford’s eastern districts, and providing a platform for delivering an urban archaeological research project within a community setting. 

 *Archeox* has developed an innovative form of “active citizen science” suburban landscape archaeology by enabling volunteer participation and facilitating the development of research areas through open community engagement. The project methodology and structure is outlined in **R2**. The **research and impact were co\-produced with around 650 individual community\-based volunteers**, who undertook research training within the project, in addition to engaging 7 local schools in the 11\-18 year age category, plus homeless and mental health groups. A basis of the project has been to establish a learning and training programme, to enable trained volunteers to lead and train others, passing on the skills acquired over the course of the project. 11 volunteers including residents, councillors and representatives of local historical societies sat on a project steering group \[ **R2**, p.40\], along with heritage professionals from the City Council and Oxford Archaeology, and were involved in all aspects of the project’s strategy and direction. This inclusive management structure was key to the Heritage Lottery Fund’s agreement to fund the project, but also to the success of the research. 

 The landscape of East Oxford is a part of the Upper Thames Valley, which is recognized as a corridor for the settlement and acculturation of societies from early prehistory to the present. It has historically seen low levels of developer\-funded archaeological research, yet extensive gardens, parks, allotments, playing\-fields and meadows preserve important archaeological remains. The wide community reach of *Archeox,* with volunteers active in allotment associations, charities, churches, parks and community groups, provided an unprecedented level of access permissions to public and private areas, including private gardens, which would not otherwise have been open to archaeological activity. The project has generated a substantial research archive **\(**a project monograph \[ **R2\]**, summary article \[ **R3**\] and online database \[ **R4\]\)** consisting of: 

-  A significant new body of information covering long\-term landscape development in the East Oxford study area \(hitherto under\-researched\), through an extensive test\-pitting programme, geophysics, palaeoenvironmental research, and targeted excavation. The new data include the distribution of prehistoric settlement, environmental history, and the development of settlements in the Roman to Medieval periods. 

-  Collections research – new investigations and interpretation of archived artefacts and documentary sources important to the prehistory and history of Oxford. 

-  Excavation of a rare medieval leper hospital of national importance, producing important structural, biological, stable isotopic, and palaeopathological data. 

-  Excavation of parts of the cloister and outbuildings of a rare medieval nunnery of national importance, giving new information about diet, economy and industry. 

-  Collections research and a geophysical survey led to the discovery of a new Neolithic site on the Thames gravels at Donnington Recreation Ground \(excavated in late 2013\). 

 In **R2**, Richard Bradley called the project results ‘ *a revelation’* and notes the unique success of the community\-based, co\-produced methodology: *‘it is this combination of methods, along with the skills of the participants, that really breaks new ground*’ *.*

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *Archeox* has led to change in 3 primary areas for the Oxford city community: 

-  **on participants,** including increased knowledge and skills through citizen science training, changed perceptions and awareness, and benefits to educational & career development, health & wellbeing. 

-  **on local heritage** **initiatives** that continue to benefit from the training of participants 

-  **on heritage management practice** in Oxford and Oxfordshire **.** 

 The project has been recognised by the Lottery Fund as an exemplar in public engagement with research **\[E1\].** 

 **Increasing public understanding, learning and participation in Oxford’s archaeology** 

 During the funded phase from 2010\-2015, there were over 650 active volunteer registrations across the project period, most of which continued to be active between Aug 2013 and Aug 2015; **2400** of the total 6,000\+ volunteer\-days which were recorded took place after Aug 2013. Volunteers were self\-selected from the local Oxford community, came from a range of socio\-economic backgrounds ranging from deprived to relatively advantaged, and ranged in age from older children of 10\+ to pensioners of 70\-80. **From Aug 2013 onwards** they were integrally involved in the following activities: 

-  **1** of the 3 **main site excavations** \(Donnington Recreation Ground\). 

-  **25** test pit excavations. 

-  **3** National Archaeology festivals, estimated attendance of c. **600 visitors overall**. 

-  **4 open days/exhibitions** \- Bartlemas Chapel \(excavation site\), indoor exhibition, August 2013; Donnington Bridge excavation open days \(September 2013\); Pitt\-Rivers Museum temporary exhibition \(October 2013\). 

-  **an estimated 100 outreach and offsite activities** including lectures and workshops \(33\), processing sessions \(20\), field surveys, research group meetings, social events, and practical training days. 

 **Training** was a core component of the project in order to **increase the archaeological understanding** of the volunteers. The research team, led by Griffiths, alongside professional archaeologists from Oxford Archaeology, gave *Archeox* volunteers detailed training on key excavation skills such as learning how to record context sheets, create detailed drawings \(plans and sections\), measure and record small finds, identify and lift bones, prepare soil samples and process using flotation \[ **R2**\]. Volunteers were also enabled to deliver training themselves as they gained skills, knowledge, and teaching ability to share these skills and knowledge with others. There were **19 training sessions for around 25 people each time, many led by volunteers** between Aug 2013\-Aug 2015, plus public lectures and workshops for volunteers. 

 Participation in the project by the volunteers has been shown to have had a significant impact in terms of **increased knowledge and skills and perceptions of community.** A commissioned independent HLF\-funded evaluation from 2015 **\[E2\]** produced a 140\-page report which described the benefits of the project to volunteers and the local organisations involved in *Archeox,* including a survey of **101** *Archeox* volunteers. In the survey, **97% of the respondents indicated their** **awareness of heritage and archaeology** **had increased** as a result of the project, and **89% agreed their** **enthusiasm for learning** **more had increased**. Comments from the survey also show examples of how volunteers were able to share their new knowledge with others, and have often had secondary benefits as a result: 

-  *“I have learnt many practical skills, which I have passed on to others in a new archaeology group, based in Cherwell area.”* 

-  ‘ *This is my first venture into the world of archaeology, which has been a very enjoyable experience. I left school at the age of 15, 55 years ago, with no formal qualifications. This project has motivated me to investigate the early history of my own community, and to write up my findings.’* 

-  *Even though I have lived in East Oxford for over 50 years, East Oxford was a complete blank in my mind before the* Archeox *Project. My concept of Oxford was entirely dominated by the University and the elite power structures associated with it. It has been a revelation to learn about the social and economic aspects of ‘the other Oxford’.* 

 The project was also successful in **reaching and connecting a wide range of participants** within East Oxford across the community: over 85% of **E2** respondents replied that they met people from a range of ages and backgrounds during the project, and 66% felt the project reflected the social and **economic diversity of East Oxford.** Respondents also reported that their **perception of the community** was improved as a result of the project: ‘ *This was my first hands\-on experience of archaeology… It helped me feel more a part of the community, and of the continuum of history in East Oxford*’ **\[E2,** appendix **\].** 

 **Benefits to personal development, health and wellbeing** 

 *Archeox* also played a significant role in **raising the educational aspirations of some volunteers**, and supporting **career development**. The project supported 9 senior school / FE college \(16\-18 y/o\) student work placements continuing from Aug 2013\- Aug 2015, and provided opportunities for **27 volunteers pursuing qualifications** to gain practical experience through *Archeox*. There are also at least 4 instances of *Archeox* experience resulting in **jobs or career development for volunteers**. According to one survey respondent: *“The main difference \[made by the project\] was actually for my son who undertook work experience with* Archeox *and ended up enjoying it so much he contributed to two further projects. It cemented his interest in mediaeval history and archaeology which he went on to study at university.”* **\[E2, p.35\].** Another said it had **directly led to employment** for them, after a long period of being out of work: *‘It has given me a lot more confidence. I have been able to do more than I expected and meeting people enabled me to get a job as I had been unemployed for some time’.* **\[E2, p. 38\]**. Another obtained a job in professional archaeology on the basis of their experience with the project **\[E2, p.36\].** 

 *Archeox* volunteers were also involved in outreach activities with specific community groups, aiming to reach groups who might not normally have access to archaeology. They worked with **5 local charities and youth groups**, holding 30 sessions on test\-pitting \(some of which took place on charity\-owned land\), recording and interpreting finds, including local **mental health** charity Restore, Julian Housing for homeless individuals, and The Clockhouse, a group in Blackbird Leys for over\-60s. The volunteers were supported to ensure that they could adapt to the needs of these groups. For example, many of the participants from the Clockhouse group were less physically able to participate in site excavations, so the project instead brought the excavation to them by holding finds washing sessions and teaching the members how to process the finds. One of the service\-users of a mental health charity who had suffered agoraphobia and social anxiety commented on how *Archeox* provided an opportunity for her to gain volunteering experience in a safe and encouraging environment: **\[E2, p45\].** *Archeox* also had a significant **benefit to the mental health and wellbeing** of some of the volunteers, with one reflecting: “ *I had a break in my career due to anxiety and depression…I was finding it difficult to relate to people at the time, because of my anxiety. \[*Archeox *\] helped me a lot, got me out of the house and got me doing something physical and practical and involving. And on the social side, \[I was\] meeting people who I wouldn’t have met any other way*.” **\[R2, p.51\].** 

 **Empowering the community – building capacity for impact on heritage** 

 By creating a network of skilled volunteers, *Archeox* has **increased the capacity for heritage understanding and skills** in the Oxfordshire area. *Archeox*\-trained volunteers continue to work together and with the University of Oxford on legacy projects; examples include but are not limited to the following: 

-  **Westgate Redevelopment Outreach Project.** As part of a GBP500,000,000 redevelopment project in Oxford in 2015\-16, 30 *Archeox* volunteers \(forming 90% of the Westgate project’s community participants\) were a crucial part of the excavation’s outreach programme, led by \(commercial practice\) Oxford Archaeology **\[E3\]**. Volunteers staffed pop\-up museums and walking trails, applying the skills and knowledge they had gained through *Archeox*. According to a leading Oxford City Archaeologist *“*Archeox *volunteers were central to the success of the \[…\] pop\-up museums in the Westgate and Town Hall as part of the Westgate redevelopment archaeological outreach project which **significantly contributed towards the level of public engagement and contributed towards the award of 2016 BAA Best Archaeological Project** to Oxford Archaeology and the Westgate Alliance.”*  The Community Officer for Oxford Archaeology echoes this: *“The Pop Up in total attracted over 5,500 visitors in total and \[…\]* Archeox *volunteers had around 1,500 visitors. The volunteers were vital to its success”* **\[E4\]** 

-  **Long Wittenham and the Sylva Trust.** Trained *Archeox* volunteers participated in 2 excavations in Long Wittenham, Oxfordshire, including a rare Anglo\-Saxon hall \(2015\-16\). **Archeox** volunteers were named in the bid that helped the Sylva Trust to secure 98,300in funding from HLF** in 2019 for the ‘House of Wessex’ Project which has reconstructed the hall using traditional craft techniques. The CEO of the Sylva Trust writes *: “Because of the experience of its volunteers in excavating and researching medieval sites in Oxfordshire, and the impetus and training continuing from **Archeox**, it proved possible to have a really effective and informative excavation of the Anglo\-Saxon Hall*.” **\[E5\]** 

-  **The Appleton Area Archaeology Research Project \(AAARP\)** Formed in 2015 by *Archeox* volunteers with support of Dr Jane Harrison, the project applies the methodologies developed through *Archeox*: training members of the community in order to research local heritage that would otherwise have remained undocumented. The group now has a contact list of over 100 people, they have published an article in a local journal and have completed: 46 test pits, 2 week\-long excavations, archive research, talks, and 9 surveys totalling over 1200 volunteer days. Trustees attribute their success to *Archeox: “Without* Archeox *\[…\] AAARP could not and would not exist.”* \[E6\] 

-  **The Littlemore History Society** First formed in 1967, and reformed by *Archeox* volunteers in 2011, the society has grown to 30 paid members with a mailing list reaching 100\+ locals in 2019. The *Archeox* team have continued to support LLHS from 2013 to present through skills sharing and training events. The LLHS group has contributed significantly to understanding of local heritage: in 2018 LLHS completed 4 years of reports to the *Journal South Midlands Archaeology \(*based on 3 test pit sites in the village\) and are working with Oxfordshire Building Record \(OBR\) to assess the standing buildings **\[E7\].** 

-  **The Cherwell Archaeology Group in Kidlington.** Formed in 2014, the group comprises 22 volunteers. They have initiated a project to map and report the history of the workers along the Oxford Canal. Applying the skills learned through the *Archeox* project – such as test pitting, stonework recording, and historical research – the project has raised awareness of local heritage and created a new focus and appreciation for a derelict area. The group received CBA membership in 2019 **\[E8\].** 

 **Influence on Oxford City heritage records, planning & engagement** 

 An Archaeologist at Oxford City Council stated: **“**Archeox: The Archaeology of East Oxford Project *added valuable new research data to the city, and it has changed the way in which we view the potential of archaeology in the community, as reflected in the Oxford Archaeological Action Plan and subsequent excavation projects*” **\[E9a\].**  *Archeox* has amassed a substantial amount of new data for Historic Environment Records \(HERs\) for Oxford. The same archaeologist emphasises that this dataset has increased awareness and knowledge of local heritage and has also directly impacted the process for decision\-making on planning permissions, particularly at Bartlemas Chapel and Littlemore Priory, where recognition of their broader landscape context and social value as a result of *Archeox*’s work has been applied to ongoing building works **\[E9b\]**. Furthermore, the success of the *Archeox* approach has influenced the creation of **a strong community\-based theme in the current revisions of Oxford City Council’s Heritage and Archaeological Action Plans**. One of the stated objectives of Oxford’s Archaeological Action Plan 2013\-18 is to *‘Encourage community participation, enjoyment and appreciation of Oxford’s Heritage’*, and the Council Board Member for City Development mentioned *Archeox* as the key causative component and exemplar in this aspect of the Historic Environment in Oxford in his Foreword to the Action Plan: “ *Interest and appreciation of the rich historic environment to be found across the modern city is developing rapidly. This \[…\] has been demonstrated by the large numbers of people attracted to participate in the East Oxford Community Archaeology Project* **” \[E10\].** The project has also led to changes among Oxfordshire County Council staff in how they approach public engagement in local archaeology: one staff member, who went on to work for the County HER, commented, “ *what I like is how **it has changed my attitude of how I work in each role**…  I am trying to do more in outreach and engagement in county council…  Now I know there is so much enthusiasm and people just don’t know how to access* \[the data\]… *I’m always trying to think now how could we reach people* **.”** **\[E2, p60\]**. 

 The exemplary nature of the project is summarised by the MP for Oxford East from 1987 to 2017: *“It was wonderful to see **the scholarship of Oxford University allied so closely with the enthusiasm of local people** **of all ages** keen to learn about what community archaeology could reveal about the past, and the lives of those who at different times also shared this space. This really was an initiative which **brought town and gown together**… **It was great that the diversity of East Oxford was reflected in those who took part in the work.** The success of the project has valuable lessons not only for the enormous potential for similar projects here and elsewhere, but more generally in how Continuing Education really can reach and engage the community”* **\[R2, p. xvii\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by the University of Aberdeen has shaped a social practices approach to adult literacies in Rwanda, combining expertise in adult literacies education with an in\-depth knowledge of Rwandan everyday social practices. The research has led to the development of Rwanda’s first\-ever qualification aimed at adult educators, which, in turn, has enhanced the knowledge and skills of adult literacy practitioners, increased adult literacy levels and improved the quality of life for both tutors and learners. The work has also provided a valuable evidence base to inform government policy on adult education in Rwanda. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In a country where only a third of adults have completed primary school, and nearly a third cannot read or write a short note \[6\], delivery of adult literacy classes depends heavily on untrained community tutors, many of whom have only completed primary school\-level education themselves. The government also relies on non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) to provide literacy classes.  Literacy centres in Rwanda are generally in churches, although some literacy classes are held in the open; these literacy centres are poorly equipped, with few learning resources and many do not even have a chalk board. As a result, few adult literacy learners develop skills that they can use in their daily lives including skills that would enable them to improve their quality of life, such as greater autonomy and problem\-solving skills \[6\]. Without literacy skills, individuals cannot get paid non\-farm employment and rely on day farm labouring or subsistence farming to make a livelihood and are denied opportunities to be local leaders, cannot help their children with schoolwork and often feel marginalised within their communities. 

 The University of Rwanda is the only public university that provides a pre\-service degree for training tutors for the 13 teacher training colleges. Districts are responsible for coordinating adult literacy tutors' training and the delivery of literacy classes with NGOs, religious institutions, and other development partners running literacy classes. The Rwandan National Adult Education Strategic Plan, designed as a tool for planning, coordination and monitoring the implementation of the Adult Education Policy \(2014\), has never been prioritised \[6\]. 

 **Curriculum design & pedagogy** 

 Professor Ackland has examined the relationships between theory, policy and practice in a period of reform in adult education in Scotland on adopting the ‘Social Practices Approach’ \(SPA\) \[1, 2\]. The research \[2\] has illuminated the complexities of education reform and the challenges of transforming educational practices congruent with radical theory. The social practices approach is primarily a theory of literacies in society that emphasises inherent power relationships that influence the uses of literacies in social contexts, and the situated nature of literacies acquisition. It requires an educational approach that draws on learners’ interests and supports them to participate in the literacies practises that have meaning and value in their everyday lives. 

 Ackland’s research showed the importance of challenging adult educators’ understandings of literacy to enable them to transform their learning strategies and enable learners to participate in literacies practices that learners identify as being important for them. The research into the Scottish experience underpinned an approach to the professional development of adult literacies teacher educators, tutors and volunteers in Rwanda, which recognised the significance of local context, the barriers to change, the necessity of re\-conceptualisations of practice and the collaborative methods required to affect transformation. 

 **Understanding the Rwandan context** 

 Research carried out by Professor Pamela Abbott, Director of the Centre for Global Development, School of Education, has provided a detailed understanding of everyday social practices in Rwanda – how people – including the poorest and most deprived – live their daily lives \[3\-5\]. Abbott’s body of work is comprised of a series of studies into lifestyles and living conditions in Rwanda carried out in collaboration with Rwandan colleagues \(including Roger Mugisha, Co\-PI\) from the Institute of Policy Analysis and Research\-Rwanda \(IPAR\-Rwanda, the leading think\-tank in Rwanda\). 

 **Adult literacies in the Western Province \(2018\-current\)** 

 Combining these bodies of research has enabled the team of Aberdeen researchers \(Ackland, Abbott and Mtika\) to leverage funding worth nearly GBP1,200,000 from the Scottish Government to undertake a programme of applied research titled ‘Fostering a social practice approach to adult literacies for improving people's quality of life in Western Rwanda’ \[P1\]. Western Province, the focus of Aberdeen research, is the poorest province in Rwanda, with 69% of the population living in poverty and 88% of the population living in rural areas. 

 This project is the first of its kind in Rwanda, brings together a collaboration with the University of Rwanda and the Institute of Policy Analysis and Research \(IPAR\-Rwanda\), using a mixed\-methods approach to answer ‘what’, ‘why’’ and how’ questions about the adult literacy education provision available in the Western province. The Rwandan lead, Associate Professor Wenceslas Nzabalirwa \(IPAR\-Rwanda\), working closely with the Aberdeen team, is responsible for the implementation of the project by TTCs of Rubengera, Gacuba II and Mururu. The project objectives included; the validation of a Professional Diploma in SPA at the University of Rwanda; and the training of BEd students and tutors in TTCs qualifying them to train adult literacy tutors to use a SPA. As part of the project, an initial scoping study was undertaken by the Aberdeen team, \[6\] as well as a review of the 2014 Adult Education Policy \(undertaken by Abbott\). Based on interviews with regional and district stakeholders including six of the seven District Directors of Education in Western Province and Professionals in Charge of Adult Education, the Director of Planning in the Ministry of Education, the Deputy Director of the Rwanda Education Board, and representatives of NGOs delivering literacy classes \[6\], the team concluded that: 

-  The University of Rwanda and TTCs required support to build capacity to train the trainers, and train adult literacy tutors as set out in the 2014 Adult Education Policy and its strategic plan; 

-  A ‘hybrid’ rather than a ‘purer’ SPA approach  was required to ensure that students cover the Rwanda Adult Education Literacy syllabus; 

-  To ensure sustainability, a cost\-efficient model of training community literacy tutors, using an apprenticeship model and utilising cheap, locally available learning materials, needs to be put in place.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The ‘Fostering a Social Practice Approach to Adult Literacies’ project and building on established relationships within Rwanda, has enabled the University of Rwanda and TTCs to implement the guidance from the research and contributed to the Rwandan government’s mission to improve adult literacy levels and enhance wellbeing in the country. Specifically, Aberdeen’s collaborative work with the University of Rwanda and IPAR has introduced a new qualification for adult educators and has enhanced the knowledge and skills of adult literacy practitioners in Rwanda. Furthermore, the work has increased adult literacy levels, improved the quality of life of adult learners, and provided an evidence base to guide implementation of Rwandan government policy towards the sustainable delivery of adult basic education. 

 **Introducing a new Professional Diploma qualification for adult educators in Rwanda** 

 The Aberdeen research applying the social practices approach to adult literacy training in Rwanda has guided implementation of 2014 Adult Education policy and led to the country’s first\-ever qualification aimed at adult educators, validated and delivered by the University of Rwanda \[S1\]. Abbott, Ackland and Mtika built capacity in SPA at the University of Rwanda by training five established academic staff members in the approach enabling the University to provide pre\-service and in\-service teacher training both in delivering adult literacy classes and in training community literacies tutors, who are untrained ‘volunteers’ \[S1i\]. 

 The Aberdeen team adopted an apprenticeship model based on initial scoping interviews with key stakeholders and has continued to provide professional guidance, including tutor training materials \[S1ii\] enabling the team at the University of Rwanda to develop and validate a professional postgraduate diploma, in order to deliver a ‘train the trainer’, model. The diploma was validated by the University of Rwanda Senate and is now an approved element of the Rwanda National Qualifications Framework for Higher Education \(RNQFHE\) \[S1iii\]. In order to support its embedding and implementation, two members of staff are now registered with the University of Aberdeen, studying for PhDs to enable the College to support the Rwandan Government in implementing the 2014 Adult Education Policy. Mayors from all districts have acknowledged the benefit of the project, with the Major of Rubavu District, in particular, expressing appreciation, stating that in Rubavu: 

 *The project has trained five community literacy tutors and 159 students in 2018\-2019, 18 community literacies tutors and 343 students in 2019\-2020, not to forget 20 community literacies tutors and 578 students recruited for 2020\-2021. \(The project\) has tremendously supported the district in achieving its target by training not only adult learners but also the district professional in charge of adult education* \[S2i\]. 

 Similarly, the Mayor of Rusizi District confirmed that the project has introduced an approach that is helping the community to improve their quality of life while at the same time acquiring skills of reading, writing and numeracy \[S2ii\]. 

 **Enhancing the Knowledge and Skills of Adult Literacy Practitioners** 

 The SPA model has enhanced the knowledge and skills of tutors working within TTCs and community literacies tutors. Tutors from the Gacuba II Teacher Training College have described the training as improving their competencies, enhancing respect and recognition from society, especially adult literacies learners, and helping them to contribute to the development of education more generally in Rwanda \[S3\]. Based on these enhanced skills, the apprenticeship ‘train the trainer’ model, enabling those who have completed the postgraduate diploma to train community literacies tutors \(volunteers\), has been successfully rolled out to teacher training colleges in Western province. The model has been adopted by the Association Rwandaise des Travailleurs Chrétiens Féminine \(ARTCF Rwanda\), a local NGO that, as part of its work, delivers adult literacy classes in Southern, Western and Northern Provinces. In 2019 ARTCF successfully applied for funding \(GBP13,634\) to implement the model. By December 2020, 215 community tutors had been trained \[S4, S5, S6\]. 

 The community tutors have also confirmed the efficacy of the new approach. In interviews carried out as part of the regular project evaluations, tutors have described the approach as ‘much better’ than previous methods that ‘did not work very well’ because it supports adult learners to ‘discuss their problems and come up with ideas as to how they can help themselves to overcome them’. Munyantore Peter, a community tutor at the Kabahire Adult Learning Centre, has described the benefits, both to himself and to his learners, in detail: 

 *I thought that the training that the project was going to give me would mean that I would have more knowledge about teaching adult literacy and more skills in teaching and that this would make me a better teacher. However, apart from enabling me to improve my skills in teaching, reading, writing and numeracy, it has helped me to enable \[my students\] to understand how they can improve their daily lives* \[S3\]. 

 **Increasing Literacies Levels Among Adults** 

 This model, underpinned by the Aberdeen research, has meant that by December 2020, 6,190 learners had graduated from a programme using the SPA taught by a trained tutor and a further 6,132 were awaiting examination \[S7\]. The overall student satisfaction for the courses taught by tutors in teacher training colleges was over 90%. Adult learners say they have gained basic knowledge \(writing, reading, counting and ICT\) in a short time, learned how to collaborate and cooperate with others and feel more trusted by their communities. Aberdeen research has also raised awareness in national media of the importance of building critical infrastructure to ensure that adults have basic literacy capabilities \[S8\]. 

 **Improving the quality of life of community tutors and adult learners** 

 Community tutors and adult learners have not only benefitted from the programme by gaining skills that they can use in their everyday lives, but their feedback also points to improvements in their quality of life. Besides reading, writing and counting, learners and community tutors point to improved knowledge and skills of planning and cooking a balanced diet, strategies to prevent HIV/ AIDS, family planning strategies, health management and sanitation, environmental protection and crop management, and financial management. Many tutors and learners are accessing financial support \[S3\] to help them grow their food to improve their family diet and start income\-generating projects. Community tutor Nyiraguhirwa Agathe has described how her students, 

 *Share their ideas and discuss together under my guidance and come to decisions about what their main problems are. Then they discuss what they can do. They have decided to have a mutual fund \(savings club\) and to use the money they saved to purchase pigs and rabbits to rear, and to buy seeds so they can have kitchen gardens and give their families a balanced diet* \[S3\]. 

 **Providing an evidence\-base to inform Rwandan government policy** 

 The Aberdeen research has influenced national \(Ministry of Education, Rwanda Education Board\) policy, and in turn informed approaches for implementation of adult basic education in three districts \(Karongi, Rabavu, Rusziz\) by demonstrating the importance of having trained tutors and of using a pedagogy that engages learners and gives them skills that they can use in their everyday lives. The Rwandan lead for the project, Associate Professor Wenceslas, was invited by the Rwandan Education Board to provide advice on educating adults through a four\-week group workshop in October 2020 \[S9i\]. Acting Director\-General, Rwanda Education Board confirmed that this contribution enabled the development of adult education syllabi for levels 2 and 3 and that his involvement enabled ‘ *participants to adapt and embed the SPA in the Adult Education Curriculum’* \[S9ii\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at SOAS has openly challenged public perceptions that Fairtrade and other certification schemes improve conditions for the poorest people in producing countries. Initial research on the effects of Fairtrade certification on rural labour markets and wages and a subsequent systematic review of wider agricultural certification schemes, have had an impact on the practices of agricultural certification standard bodies \(including Fairtrade International and the ISEAL Alliance\) in terms of monitoring and assessment of the impact of the schemes as well as on standard setting. The research has informed the reform of the coffee sector in Ethiopia and has also changed public understanding of certification standards.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Fairtrade schemes award certifications to producers of commodities such as coffee, tea, bananas, flowers, cocoa etc. to reassure consumers that these are produced in relatively “decent” working conditions. Yet, prior to the research described in this case study, there had been virtually no independent research on the impact of such certifications on the poorest people, especially wage workers, and on the effectiveness of agricultural certification schemes in addressing rural poverty. Fairtrade was and remains the best known of these schemes and it has separate certification standards for ‘hired labour’ and ‘smallholder’ producer organizations \(SPOs\), based upon the assumption that smallholder producers did not employ significant numbers of wage workers. Fairtrade also claimed that rural producer cooperatives were democratic and egalitarian, again without a strong foundation in independently collected, methodologically careful research. Meanwhile, standards monitoring organizations like ISEAL \(the global membership organization for credible sustainability standards\) also lacked knowledge and capabilities in this respect. 

 SOAS\-led research has challenged such assumptions with two research projects. The first project was led by Christopher Cramer \(Professor of the Political Economy of Development\); the second by Carlos Oya \(Professor of the Political Economy of Development\). The research also engaged John Sender \(Emeritus Professor of Economics at SOAS\), Deborah Johnston \(then Professor of Economics, SOAS\), and Florian Schaefer at LSE. 

 In the first project \- Fairtrade, Employment, and Poverty Reduction in Ethiopia and Uganda, FTEPR \(2010\-2014, Department for International Development, GBP692,958\) \- the researchers carried out fieldwork in Ethiopia and Uganda. Surveys were conducted to compare labour markets and production, looking at areas with 1\) certified producer organizations; 2\) smallholder production with no Fairtrade certified organizations; and 3\) areas defined around large\-scale commercial plantations. In total, 1,700 people were interviewed, through individual interviews and focus group discussions – including cooperative leadership, private plantation and company managers and owners, policy officials and wage workers **\[3.3\]**. The research showed that huge numbers of very poor people depend for their survival on wage employment in small\-scale coffee and tea production in Ethiopia and Uganda. The key finding was that Fairtrade certification could not be associated with any positive outcomes for wage workers compared to other production arrangements **\[3.1\]**. This was the case both in larger scale flower farms in Ethiopia and in smallholder producer organizations \(SPOs\). Further, the research found that cooperatives were highly unequal organizations, in which the largest and best\-off producer\-members captured most of the limited gains from Fairtrade certification **\[3.2\]**. The research recommended changes to the claims made by Fairtrade as well as improved monitoring to ensure better wages and working conditions **\[3.2\]**. 

 Following the dissemination of the FTEPR findings, the Campbell Collaboration \(the leading international organisation promoting evidence\-based policy in the form of systematic reviews\) and 3ie\-International Initiative for Impact Evaluation commissioned and funded \(GBP71,624, 2014\-2016\) a systematic review of research on the impact of all agricultural certification schemes on socio\-economic outcomes for producers and wage workers in developing countries **\[3.4; 3.6\]**. 

 The systematic review carried out in 2016 and 2017 provided the first exhaustive and rigorous review of the state of the evidence on the impact of standards systems – certification \- in developing countries. The work entailed a critical review and analysis of the evidence from 43 quantitative impact evaluations that explored the effectiveness of certification schemes, and 136 qualitative studies examining the barriers to and enablers of effective certification schemes. It found some marginal, positive effects of certification schemes on producer prices and on certified farmer incomes but no effects on household incomes or assets and mild, negative effects on wages **\[3.4; 3.6\]**. This lack of clear effects was compounded by the limited evidence base for each outcome and by widely varying results across what studies there were **\[3.5; 3.6\]**. The study recommended that organizations revise their claims to effectiveness and improve their reporting practices and monitoring capabilities to ascertain the impact of their interventions.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has had an impact on the practices of specific organizations, especially Fairtrade and ISEAL, as well as on public understanding of certification schemes. Fairtrade has since changed its standards to pay far more attention to wages and working conditions in smallholder producer organizations. The research has also influenced the reform of the Ethiopian government policy for the coffee sector. 

####  Impact on monitoring and assessment of ‘ethical trading’ certification schemes 

 The Systematic Review **\[3.6\]** engaged representatives of the ISEAL Alliance as members of the project advisory group. ISEAL is the global membership organisation for certification schemes; most of the certifications covered in the Systematic Review are ISEAL members. Their involvement from the start facilitated the subsequent take\-up of some key recommendations. In her testimonial, the ISEAL Director of Impacts explains how the organisation has used the review as a “core resource” to forming the gathering, analysis and presentation of the evidence on the effectiveness of certification systems **\[5.1\]**. The director explains how the research has inspired ISEAL “to improve the quality of future studies and study reports”, as well to “integrate a regular systematic mapping of the literature on sustainability standards into our own operations”. Throughout the assessment period, the Systematic Review contributed to ongoing internal ISEAL discussions about the complexity of impact pathways and how to improve standards in order to meet poverty reduction goals. It raised awareness of the limited rigorous research on the impacts of standards on workers, thus providing an impetus to their fundraising for more research \- particularly on the impacts of activities undertaken by the standard systems beyond certification **\[5.1a\]**. Both projects have also shaped ISEAL commitments on how to communicate their impact more accurately to members, farmers, buyers and to the general public so that they are not misled. The report now sits on Evidensia, a platform founded in 2019 by the ISEAL Alliance, Rainforest Alliance and WWF with the support of the Global Environment Facility to improve research standards in the sector **\[5.1b\]**. The SOAS Systematic Review was cited in ISEAL’s presentation to the Global Sustainability Standards Symposium 2019 **\[5.1c, slides 13, 14, and 33\]**. Summing up the project’s impact, ISEAL writes that “Ultimately, this study provides much learning for sustainability standards and ISEAL will work with its member systems and the SOAS research team to learn from this review”. **\[5.1d p3\]**. 

 ISEAL members such as **UTZ** \(a certification scheme for the sustainable farming of coffee and cocoa\) and **Fairtrade** also individually acknowledged the Systematic Review. Fairtrade confirmed in January 2020 **\[5.2\]** that their Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning team had used the Systematic Review in \[text removed for publication\]. In their response to the review, UTZ explains that it contains important lessons that can inform their work in different areas. Specifically, in relation to their work on monitoring and evaluation, UTZ stated that a key lesson of the study was “the need to continue our investment in our M&E capacity, in order to monitor improvements and innovations to certification and evaluate impact. We will use the findings of the review to refine our Theory of Change and to unpack the underlying pathways of change and how these work in different contexts, for different farmers”. Moreover, UTZ also committed to “align and collaborate with other stakeholders to pool evaluation resources” **\[5.3 p4\]**. 

####  Impact on Fairtrade standard setting 

 After an initially hostile response, including legal threats that were then withdrawn and concerns that the FTEPR research findings might damage its reputation, Fairtrade acknowledged the utility of the SOAS research and engaged more constructively with its findings and recommendations. In June 2014, Harriet Lamb, then CEO of the Fairtrade Foundation, stated “We recognize and appreciate the insights their research gives into the type and conditions of employment of vulnerable farm workers \[…\]; we hope that the SOAS data will help address \[…\] how to better reach temporary labourers and casual workers and ensure benefits of trade include them” **\[5.4 p2\]**. A 2014 Fairtrade International and Flocert report \(FLOCert being the independently governed audit and certification body for Fairtrade\) cited the FTEPR research and recognized that workers in SPOs had been “largely overlooked”. Acknowledging that “Fairtrade’s work with farmers in cooperatives does not necessarily result in significant benefits trickling down to the workers”, the report noted that Fairtrade “will be working on this in 2015 and beyond” **\[p.24 – 5.5\]**. The annual Fairtrade report \(2017\) also cited the research and its findings concerning workers and wages in SPOs **\[p. 19 \- 5.6\]**. During a Fairtrade 2018 consultation to review SPO standards, the need to address the situation of workers in SPOs was discussed –  an issue not addressed at all in previous consultation rounds – although the consultation report indicates that many members \(who are mainly farmers/employers\) were resistant **\[5.7, p8\]**. 

 The 2016 completion review of Fairtrade’s Programme Partnership Arrangement with DFID, which was an opportunity to reflect on lessons learned over the previous period of DFID funded Fairtrade programmes, states that: “responding to research findings into working conditions and earnings of smallholder farmers, we have improved and revised the Hired Labour Standard with stronger protection and benefits for workers, launched a new project to improve the situation of workers within small farmer organizations and further improved our monitoring and evaluation systems to gather essential data on wages and working conditions to feed back into our work” **\[5.8 p27\].** The revised Fairtrade Standard for SPO \(April 2019\) amended the threshold for application of the standard so that now producers employing at least 10 workers should be subject to monitoring of working conditions, “\[to\] ensure that a larger number of workers in SPO  are covered by the requirements in the Standard”, to “strengthen the requirement \[that producers give and provide employment contracts to permanent workers\] and to promote decent work and reduction of risk of exploitative practices” **\[5.9 p9\]**. There has therefore been a clear shift in Fairtrade standards concerning wage employment in SPO, as recommended by the research. 

####  Influencing major reforms to the coffee sector in Ethiopia 

 FTEPR research also helped shape major reforms to the coffee sector in Ethiopia. After a presentation of the research to high\-level policy officials and coffee sector stakeholders in Addis Ababa \(in November 2013\), Cramer and Sender were invited to present to the then Prime Minister and his senior advisor, Dr. Arkebe Oqubay. This led to a three\-year engagement with the Prime Minister’s Office. The research team was involved in a coffee reform process led by Dr. Arkebe, for which Cramer and Sender wrote a coffee policy paper. A number of policy changes drew directly on the SOAS research findings and recommendations, including the transformation of the Jimma Agricultural Research Institute into a body with a singular focus on coffee; the need to exploit the potential for employment creation in coffee through prioritizing finance for exports; and allowing exporters and traders to invest directly in commercial coffee plantations **\[5.10\]**. 

####  Impact on media discourse and public understanding 

 The initial research \(and the related public dispute with Fairtrade itself\) has attracted extensive media and press attention and stimulated widespread international public debate. In May 2014 Christopher Cramer provided an overview of the Fairtrade research that was featured on the front page of The Observer **\[5.11a\]** as well as a letter to the Financial Times **\[5.11b\]**. The Observer article was shared online almost 500 times and led to an intense debate among readers appreciating or challenging the study and its findings. The now CEO of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data commented: “blanket rejection of a careful and well\-thought\-out study \[…\] is hardly an appropriate or adult response. The report does not reject the principle of Fair Trade but asks important questions about how it works in practice and there will be plenty of people wanting answers that have a convincing ring to them”. Another dedicated Guardian article **\[5.11c\]** was shared 1,234 times and attracted 338 comments from readers supporting or disagreeing with the research findings. One reader noted “this is a good article – it’s made me question my activities – but rather than turning my back on ethical shopping I would prefer reports like this to be used to put pressure on Fairtrade to do more to ensure that its producers are acting ethically through the chain...” **\[5.11d\]**. In June 2014 UK fair trade organization Traidcraft published a column **\[5.11e\]** in which they stated: “We welcome the research and we are keen to learn from it”. An online column in Forbes from contributor Tim Worstall \(Fellow, Adam Smith Institute in London\) reviewing the study findings was visited 23,787 times **\[5.11f\]**. The research was also covered by the Economist **\[5.11g\]** and other various print and online media in the UK, Europe, and the USA, for example in Der Spiegel **\[5.11h\]**, in 2014 and beyond. In 2019 the research was again cited in a Financial Times report **\[5.11i\]** \- the author noting that “Fairtrade International says it has since worked closely with the researchers to listen to their views and better understand some of their findings” – and in the Guardian **\[5.11j** – shared 858 times **\]**. In March 2020 the research was cited by media covering an investigation on Starbucks, Nespresso and child labour. The research has also been used as a benchmark when discussing other research projects on Fairtrade and certification schemes on public online platforms such as Twitter **\[5.11k\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken by the Association for Dementia Studies has sought to improve the lives of people living with dementia in care homes through exploring care practice and developing interventions to improve this practice. The research has informed policy, most notably NICE guidance for the assessment, management and support of people living with dementia. It has shaped and changed practice in care homes and other settings, not only through its influence on policy but also, more directly, through the centre’s research\-informed education and training programmes. Most fundamentally, it has improved the quality of life and care for people living with dementia.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Association of Dementia Studies, a research centre at the University of Worcester, has, over the last 12 years, conducted a programme of research designed to improve the lives of people with dementia. Its director, Professor Dawn Brooker, is an influential national and international figure in dementia care research, having been awarded the 2019 lifetime achievement award at the National Dementia Care Awards and made an MBE in 2020 for services to supporting those affected by dementia, through research, education, and policy advocacy. 

 This ongoing programme of research seeks to enhance the quality of care for those living within care homes by examining and understanding care home culture and practice and the experience of those in care settings, and developing and evaluating interventions that seek to develop care home staff’s knowledge and embed person\-centred dementia care.  The underpinning research has comprised: 

 **VIPS Practice Model** 

 This research established a definition of, and framework for, person\-centred dementia care in practice \(Reference 1\). 

 **PANICOA Care Homes Research** 

 People with advanced dementia face significant challenges and are vulnerable to poor quality care, neglect and abuse. The PANICOA programme commissioned eleven studies on this theme, including PIECE\-Dem \(Grant 1\). This research developed an observational tool to elucidate the experience of people with advanced dementia. PIECE\-Dem was then utilised to examine the impact of organisational care culture on the experience of care home residents \(Reference 2 and Grant 2\).  Analysis found seven inter\-related cultural elements of importance for quality of care, including values and norms of practice.  The research has since been used to underpin practical tools for use by care home practitioners and organisations, including training for care home staff. 

 **FITS into Practice Programme** 

 People with advanced dementia in care homes are at\-risk of over sedation, particularly through high rates of anti\-psychotic medication prescribing.  The FITS into Practice Programme developed, then evaluated, a 10\-day educational intervention to increase staff knowledge and attitudes about dementia, person\-centred care approaches, and reduce reliance on anti\-psychotics. \(References 3 & 4, Grant 3\).  The intervention was delivered to 100 care home staff who were then designated as ‘Dementia Care Coaches’, assuming responsibility for implementing change within their workplaces. Effectiveness data included level of antipsychotic prescribing, knowledge and attitudes. Qualitative data was gathered to understand implementation issues. Results showed significantly increased knowledge and staff confidence, as well as improved attitudes towards dementia.  There was a 31% reduction in antipsychotic prescribing with additional dose reductions reported alongside improved personalised goal attainment. Barriers to implementation were highlighted, alongside methods to overcome these in practice. 

 **Namaste Care Intervention** 

 People with advanced dementia in care homes often have very little interaction. This research \(Reference 5, Grant 4\) evaluated the implementation and impact of a structured daily programme of Namaste Care \(physical, sensory and emotional care\) delivered by care home staff.  The research has revealed areas of impact for care home residents including: 

-  Significant increases in quality of life. 

-  Significant reduction in levels of agitation. 

-  Observations of enhanced wellbeing, responsiveness and communication. 

 Quality of care improvements were recorded by family and staff such as improved relationships, feeling more empowered to provide care, seeing that care made a difference to residents' lives.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has had three primary impacts: 

-  It has informed policy, specifically national practice guidelines for the care of people living with dementia and their carers, and training standards for the workforce providing this care. 

-  It has directly informed the practice of care homes through a research\-informed education and training programme and through the provision of guidance and support on best practice to organisations, notably during the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

-  Most significantly, it has improved quality of care for those living with dementia in care home settings. 

 *Impact on policy* 

 The VIPS definition of person\-centred care has been adopted within NICE guidance for the assessment, management and support of people living with dementia \(Source A\).  The guidance is key for informing care home practice but there is evidence that this approach is being implemented beyond care home settings, to assess person\-centred care within hospitals \(Source B\). 

 The research informed the development of the *Dementia Training Standards Framework* \(2015 updated in 2018\), commissioned and funded by the Department of Health and developed in collaboration by Skills for Health and Health Education England in partnership with Skills for Care:  [https://skillsforhealth.org.uk/wp\-content/uploads/2021/01/Dementia\-Core\-Skills\-Education\-and\-Training\-Framework.pdf](https://skillsforhealth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Dementia-Core-Skills-Education-and-Training-Framework.pdf). Brooker was part of the expert group that supported its development: the Head of Research at *Skills for Health* emphasises the key role the centre played in shaping this framework and the organisation’s wider work \(Source C\).  An example of this is ‘ [Stand by Me](https://www.skillsplatform.org/courses/2310-free-online-dementia-training-stand-by-me-dementia)’, an e\-learning resource based on the VIPS framework, developed through two grants, one from the NHS Workforce Deanery \(£10k\) and the other from the Dementia Workforce Advisory Group at the DoH \(£60k\), freely available on the *Skills for Health* platform. 

 *Impact on practice* 

 The research has informed an innovative programme of continuing professional development for care home professionals designed by staff in the centre, from a Postgraduate Certificate in Person Centred Dementia Studies, short courses and individual workshops delivered by staff in the centre  to bespoke programmes for care home providers. Examples of the programmes and their impact on practice are: 

-  Care UK, the largest independent care provider in the UK with 120 care homes, caring for approximately 8,000 people, implemented the centre’s FITS into Practice programme across all its care homes from 2015\-18, improving the “knowledge and skills of staff supporting people with dementia” and reducing antipsychotic prescribing \(Source D\) 

-  31 staff at Hallmark Care Homes, another major UK care provider, from across 17 care homes,  completed a 12\-month Dementia Coaching Programme in 2020, based on the FITS research, the aim of which is to upskill managers and leaders to train and support other staff across the organisation. Evaluation of the programme has highlighted the positive impact on the delivery of person\-centred care and states that it has led to “better quality of life for people living with dementia in our services” \(Source E\). 

-  4,000 people have completed the centre’s Dementia Champions and Dementia Leaders programmes from 25 different UK Care Home Providers. The training has also been delivered in Australia, Singapore and Japan. Evaluation of the programmes has highlighted increases in knowledge and levels of confidence and positive shifts in attitude, emphasising the subsequent impact on quality of life for residents and their family members \(Source F\). 

 The centre also provides a suite of free resources designed to inform practice. For example: 

-  It developed  [Care Fit for VIPS](https://www.carefitforvips.co.uk/), through a grant from NHS West Midlands’ End of Life and Dementia Programme \(£10k\). This web resource, which brings together up\-to\-date, research informed guidance for care in a variety of settings, enables care providers to self\-assess their practice, identify areas for improvement, then develop a Plan\-Do\-Study\-Act template. There are currently 7,000 registered users from across the world \(53% UK\). From 2019\-20, 4,800 users accessed 21,000 pages . 

-  During the Covid\-19 pandemic, the centre has provided situation\-specific guidance, e.g. how to maintain person centred care for individuals who need to be isolated, which has been disseminated by the centre itself, through its extensive practice networks, and by Worcestershire County Council and has also been incorporated into guidance provided by the National Activity Providers Association supporting care home staff to cope with loss during the pandemic \(Source G\). 

 *Impact on quality of care* 

 The research itself highlights the positive impact of various interventions on quality of care \(Reference 4 and 5\). This is further highlighted in the outcomes of Care Quality Commission \(CQC\) inspections. For example, the Deputy Chief Inspector of Adult Social Care cites the use of a specialist toolkit developed by the centre as one of the areas of outstanding practice which led to the home’s “Outstanding” rating \(Source H\). Further, care home managers have highlighted the role the centre’s research and training has played in their first “Outstanding” rating \(Source I\). 

 Namaste Care is now being used with hundreds of care home residents across the UK, supported by a Namaste Community of Practice with 189 active members.  The impact of the Namaste intervention on quality of care has been highlighted by care home staff in video testimonies collated through an Alzheimer’s Society Dissemination grant \(Source J\). It is noted in these testimonies that the intervention is a rewarding approach to deliver that reduces resident’s agitation, whilst enhancing staff\-resident engagement.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The research, conducted at SOAS, led to the development of a robust analytical method for distinguishing between Mainstream Islam, Ideological Islamism and Islamist Extremism. Expert Witness reports and examinations in UK court trials related to Islamist or Far\-Right extremism helped judges and juries distinguish between healthy, destructive and illegal religious and ideological acts, and to convict criminals guilty of acts of terrorism carried out on false religious pretexts. The research was also used for judicial training of High Court Judges and to inform the work of Counter\-Terrorism officials at the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Foreign Office, as well as UK Ambassadors and Government Ministers. The research thus allowed a fairer, fuller and more accurate understanding of Islam and Muslims at senior levels of the government and the judiciary.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The rise of the so\-called ‘Caliphate’ of the Islamic State group \(2013–2017\) in the context of the Syrian Civil War \(2012–present\) resulted in terrorist cases being prosecuted in English courts against British nationals who were alleged to have travelled to Syria to join the Islamic State group and other militant groups active in the war. This in turn created an acute problem in adjudicating in court what does and does not constitute normative and legitimate Islamic practice, and in understanding the nature of theological evidence that was adduced to justify terrorist activity. 

 The research of Dr Matthew Wilkinson, Senior Research Fellow in Contemporary Islam, developed at SOAS \(2015–2018\) drew on traditional Islamic theology as expounded in the traditional Sunni and Shia Muslim Schools of Law \(madhahib\), Critical Realist philosophy and Worldview theory to address the problem of distinguishing between Mainstream Islam, Islamism and Islamist extremism. 

 Islamic theology was used to explain the basic contours of Islamic practice and belief. Worldview theory showed how different types of Islam and Islamism are worldviews: integrated ways of being\-in and knowing\-the\-world that draw together facts \(and fictions\), laws, norms, generalisations, answers to ultimate questions to form a consistent idea of the self and its relationship to the world. Critical Realist philosophy was used to characterise different worldviews in terms of unity and diversity, and similarity and difference. Wilkinson’s research has identified and described these different worldviews as \(Fig 1\): 

 **1. Traditional Islam**, which falls within the general category of Mainstream Islam. This is the worldview of unity\-in\-diversity generated by the religious practice of those who accept and follow, to the best of their ability, the basic injunctions of the Qur’an and the Customary Prophetic Behaviour \(Sunna\) of the Prophet Muhammad, in a way that is appropriate to their circumstances without their aspiring to effect change in the political space. 

 **2. Activist Islam**, which falls within the general category of Mainstream Islam. This is Mainstream Islam as characterised by diversity\-in\-unity, practised to effect transformative personal change and/or transformative structural change in the public space according to Islamic principles. 

 **3. Ideological Islamism**, which falls within the category of Islamism. This is Islam as revolutionary political ideology directed at overthrowing, rather than transforming, existing political structures and replacing them with an Islamic State governed by Sharia Law. It is the worldview of exaggerated Muslim vs. non\-Muslim separation. 

 **4. Non\-Violent Islamist Extremism**, which falls at the intersection of Islamism and Islamist Extremism. This is Islamist ideology as it sharpens antagonistically into an absolutely divided, Manichean Us vs. Them Worldview that stresses the absolute difference between the ‘true’ ideological Muslim ‘in\-group’, and the non\-Muslim and ‘wrong’ Muslim ‘out\-groups’, who are afforded a less human or sub\-human status. 

 **5. Violent Islamist Extremism**, which falls within the category of Islamist Extremism. This is the absolutely divided, Manichean Us vs. Them Worldview by which the cosmos is constructed as a manifestation of the Eternal Struggle between Islam and Unbelief \(Kufr\). The non\-Muslim and ‘wrong’ Muslim, who do not struggle violently to establish a global Islamic state, are construed as eternal enemies of ‘true’ Islam and therefore fit to be exterminated. 



 Fig 1. The Worldviews of Mainstream Islam, Islamism and Islamist Extremism 

 Thus, Wilkinson’s research has for the first time addressed effectively and comprehensively a problem that has dogged policy makers and jurists for the last twenty years: how Mainstream Islam differs legally and practically from Islamism and Islamist Extremism. The research was made accessible through the publication of his 2018 monograph The Genealogy of Terror: How to Distinguish Between Islam, Islamism and Islamist Extremism, which was praised by high\-ranking legal practitioners/officials.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Wilkinson’s research on distinguishing between Islam, Islamism and Islamist Extremism informed a number of trials related to Islamist or Far\-Right Extremism; contributed to capacity building in the education of judges and senior barristers \(judicial training\); and influenced the work of the Home Office, Ministry of Justice, FCO and UK Government Ministers. This led to a fairer and more rigorous legal system. Max Hill QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, said that the research was ‘of enormous value to practicing criminal lawyers and to the interested “lay” reader’ **\[5.1\]**. 

####  Trials related to Islamist or Far\-Right Extremism 

 The ideas developed in Wilkinson’s research facilitated the decision\-making of judges and juries and barristers in 12 significant terrorism and hate crime trials \(2015–2019\) \[5.2\], helping them understand the nature of the Islamic or Islamist theological ideas that may be used to justify criminal acts and behaviour. Sir David Calvert Smith, former High Court Judge in charge of the Terrorism List and Chair of the Parole Board 2012–2016, stated ‘I have witnessed first\-hand, and had confirmatory reports about them from former colleagues, the impact and clarity that Dr Wilkinson’s research has brought to the understanding of Islam\-related evidence in terrorism cases’. He considered that Wilkinson’s monograph **\[3\]** ‘should be required reading for judges and lawyers tasked with handling cases of alleged “Islamic” terrorism as well as for the representatives of the media which report on them.’ **\[5.7\]** 

 Wilkinson was told by the Crown Prosecution Services \(CPS\) that his work had directly informed the understanding of the CPS in their decision\-making about which terrorism cases to prosecute or not. For example: 

 1. In November 2015, in Regina v. Rehman & Khan – instructed by the CPS – the defendants were convicted of terrorism offences, specifically of plotting to detonate a bomb in the Westfield Shopping Centre in West London. Wilkinson’s research \[5.2a\] was important since it showed that the communication of ideology by phone and social media between the defendants was consistent with their preparation of acts of terrorism. The Counsel for the Defence Zafar Ali QC, who had also acted as such in another terrorism trial – Regina v. Kamali \(2019\) \[5.2i\] – expressed his view that ‘Dr Wilkinson's ground\-breaking research in developing a method to make robust and clear distinctions between the Worldviews of Mainstream Islam, lslamism and lslamist Extremism was vital in both cases for clarifying to the Court whether evidence was extremist and/or terrorist or not’. He concluded that ‘Dr Wilkinson's research was instrumental in both cases in greatly assisting the Court’. **\[5.6\]** 

 2. Wilkinson’s research was used in the Central Criminal Court in Regina v. Kamran Hussain \(2017\) to show that evidence was consistent with the worldview and actions of the violent Islamist extremism of the so\-called Islamic State Group, and that the Defendant – a British Imam – had been encouraging his congregation to support the so\-called Islamic State group and its worldview. The research contributed to the conviction of the defendant for encouraging terrorism by showing that the teachings of 10 out of 17 sermons that were served by the prosecution as evidence strayed significantly from the teachings of Mainstream Islam into the worldviews of Islamist Extremism. **\[5.2i and 5.3\]** 

 3. In the 2017 Regina v. Burton Hate Crime Case– instructed by the CPS – the defendant was convicted of hate crime against a Muslim activist for harassing the complainant online with far right extremist taunting about the Islamic doctrine of Taquiyya \(dissimulation\). Wilkinson’s research \[5.2h\] showed that the ideas of the complainant were derived from the worldview of Mainstream Activist Islam and were not in any way extreme, and therefore not liable to the online vilification to which the complainant had been subjected. This meant that the complainant could continue his work documenting instances of anti\-Muslim prejudice and advocating institutional change unhindered by online abuse. **\[5.4, 5.5\]** 

 4. In a 2016 civil defamation case instructed by the BBC \(Shakeel Begg v. BBC\), the research showed that the ideas and preaching of the claimant were derived from the worldview of Violent Islamist Extremism and its exponents. The Hon. Mr Justice Haddon\-Cave’s judgement in this trial drew extensively and directly from Wilkinson’s Expert Witness report which became the basis of a legal test for Islamist Extremism. This was a highly unusual degree of impact in the legal space for a scholar of Islam, and The Hon. Mr Haddon\-Cave commended ‘the remarkable lucidity’ of Wilkinson’s oral evidence based on this research. **\[5.5 p69, clause 292\]** 

####  Capacity building of judges and senior barristers \(judicial training\) 

 As well as its direct impact in court, Wilkinson’s research was used by judges and senior barristers in the UK to build sustained capacity in the understanding of the procedural and theological relationship of Islam and Muslims to the Criminal Justice System. This was so that Muslims who appear in court can be treated fairly but not naively. 

 In November 2015, approximately 80 High Court judges attended Wilkinson’s lecture at the Serious Crime Conference and were empowered to know that the core Common Law principles of Equality before the Law, Mens Rea and Actus Reus, had their counterparts in Islamic Shari'a Law and therefore were not, in principle, contradictory with Islam. As a result of this lecture, Judge Richard Marks, the Common Serjeant of London, said that Wilkinson’s research ‘had helped judges reflect upon best judicial practice in crimes involving Islam and Muslims’ **\[5.9\].** 

####  Influencing the work of the Home Office, FCO and UK Government Ministers 

 This research had an impact on the deeper and more nuanced understanding of Counter\-Terrorism officials from the Home Office and Foreign & Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) in the distinction between the worldview and behaviours of Mainstream Muslims, Islamist Muslims and Islamist Extremists. In March 2017 and September 2018, Wilkinson gave a briefing to approximately 40 officials from the Home Office and Foreign Office, including 20 senior Counter\-Terrorism officials, to enable them to distinguish between the worldviews of Mainstream Islam, Ideological Islamism and Islamist Extremism, and to distinguish between healthy, destructive and illegal religious and ideological behaviours. The Head of the National Security Research Group at the FCO, described how ‘colleagues from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other Whitehall Departments have found the clarity and insight of Dr. Wilkinson’s analysis most helpful for developing our understanding of this field and for the practical work of diplomacy.’ **\[5.8\]** 

####  Informing the work of media reporting on Islamist Terrorism 

 Wilkinson’s monograph, The Genealogy of Terror: How to Distinguish Between Islam, Islamism and Islamist Extremism **\[3\]**, was also picked up by the mainstream media – in particular BBC News and ITV News – and used to inform explanatory discussion around terrorist incidents. For example, in the aftermath of the murder of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones on London Bridge on 29 November 2019, the framework from Wilkinson’s research informed discussion on the BBC Radio 4 Today **\[5.10\]**, BBC News, ITV News and BBC Newsnight programmes of 2 December 2019 **\[5.11\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Myers’s research into Muay Thai judging, has had both a new and an ongoing impact on the sport nationally and globally. His research impacts directly on judging practice, judge education and athlete performance. Myers’s operationalisation of judging criteria results in very high agreement on fight results — something that previously proved elusive outside of Thailand.  New officiating bodies have been established internationally because of this research, with their training materials underpinned by Myers’s research. The ongoing national impact of the research has been secured by training judge educators to deliver research\-informed courses for judges, coaches, and athletes. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prior to Myers’s research, national and international Muay Thai officiating bodies suffered from low consistency in terms of judges agreeing on the outcomes of fights. This was perceived as problematic, not least, in terms of the lack of direction offered to fighters and coaches, who were left second\-guessing what judges might be looking for — leaving them unsure of where to place an emphasis in fight preparation and training. The result of research into judging consistency by Myers, Nevill and Al\-Nakeeb \(2010\) changed this situation. The research explored the effect of two different methods of judging. One of the methods that clearly operationalised otherwise subjective judging criteria, resulted in very high agreement, making judging more consistent and offering a clear direction to athletes and coaches informing their training, technically, tactically, and strategically. The other method suffered from inadequate levels of agreement. 

 This conclusion was based on the result of two related studies outlined in Myers, et al.’s paper. The first study found that the judging criteria used in Thailand were more consistent than the methods used by UK judges and those judging international Muay Thai bouts. The second study established that a judging system based on the one used in Thailand could improve judging consistency in a completely different cultural context. The research found that judging consistency improves notably when using clearly defined judging criteria applied holistically and, in particular, when subjective concepts such as effective strikes are clearly operationalised. This finding has been fundamental in training judges to be consistent in their decisions — something previously absent in Muay Thai, outside elite groups of professional judges in Thailand. 

 The impact of the judging systems on athlete performance was examined using performance analysis methods \(Myers, Nevill and Al\-Nakeeb, 2013\). Using bespoke analysis software authored by Myers, the research compared techniques and technique quality between different groups of fighters. Differences were found between fighters who had been judged exclusively using inconsistent western judging methods and those judged by a more consistent Thai\-style judging system. The study concluded that when judges are more consistent, competitors employ a greater number of visually spectacular and effective techniques, as well as delivering techniques of higher quality. This finding was supported by a subsequent study by Myers, Balmer, Nevill, and Al\-Nakeeb \(2013\) using multilevel modelling and simulation. 

 In addition to the research on judging consistency, Myers also looked at other factors that influence judging performance. Building on previous work on crowd noise effects \(e.g., Nevill, Balmer & Williams, 2002; Unkelbach & Memmert, 2010\), Myers and colleagues explored crowd noise influences upon officials in Muay Thai. This research involved two studies: Myers and Balmer \(2012\) and Myers, Nevill and Al\-Nakeeb’s \(2012\). Adding to previous findings on crowd noise and home advantage, the combined findings of these studies demonstrated a crowd noise effect across cultures and in an externally valid setting. This has proved useful in making judges aware of this issue, and in adopting different strategies to mediate any resulting bias.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Overview of impact** 

 The reach and significance of the impact of Myers’s research on judging practices in Muay Thai are substantial — having fundamentally improved the way that the sport is judged globally. The research has influenced judge educators, coaches, and athletes. The research has improved understanding of Muay Thai judging, identified appropriate criteria, and determined how criteria are best operationalised to ensure consistency. These widely adopted judging practices now form part of the training and assessment of officials across the sport. For example, in the UK the research has impacted judging practice in over 6000 fights during this REF period. This has resulted in these fights being judged very consistently, further enhancing the sport’s reputation. 

 The significant, ongoing influence of Myers’s research on judging Muay Thai, has led to claims by the key figures in the Muay Thai community such as: “I’m hard pushed to think of anyone who has made such an impact on raising the level of worldwide Muay Thai as Tony Myers” \(Don Heatrick, Muay Thai performance coach; S1\); “…his \[Myers’s\] research has had a massive influence on how the sport is ‘played’, not just in the UK but in other countries …” \(Darren Phillips, elite coach and judge educator; S2\), and “Tony Myers’s research into Muay Thai judging and particularly on consistency in judging, has changed the way judges now judge the sport in many countries outside of Thailand, including the USA.”\( Dr Stephen Strotmeyer, president of the USMF; S3\). 

 Alongside previous significant influences on governing and officiating bodies in England, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, and Canada, Myers’s research has resulted in new impact, with officiating and sanctioning bodies being established in the USA and New Zealand during the latest REF period. Myers’s research was the stimulus for their formation and now informs training for these bodies. The sustained, ongoing impact of the research in the UK is now secured, with several judge educators now trained to deliver research\-informed training for Muay Thai officials across England, Scotland and Wales. 

 **Influence on establishing an officiating body in the USA and ongoing influence** 

 Because of Myers’s research and its influence on judging globally, senior USA Muay Thai officials, Dr Stephen Strotmeyer and Mark DeLuca travelled to the UK in 2015 to discuss Muay Thai judging and his research\-informed training methods. On returning to the USA, they formed the Independent Board of Muay Thai Officials \(USA\) and used Myers’s research informed training materials to educate officials. After difficulties with some state athletic bodies, they went on to form the USMF Technical Officials Commission a body recognised by the International Olympic Committee. Strotmeyer, president of the USMF, now oversees the education of athletes, coaches, and officials with training underpinned by Myers’s research. The group also intend to build on this research in future with research of their own \(S3\). 

 **Influence on establishing an officiating body in New Zealand and ongoing influence** 

 Myers’s research has also positively impacted Muay Thai judging in New Zealand.  In 2019, after being disillusioned with the standard of Muay Thai competition and judging in New Zealand, Scott Tweedie formed a Muay Thai sanctioning body, the Aotearoa Muay Thai Association \(AMTA\). The rules \(S4\) and training methods employed used Myers’s research. Tweedie, president of AMTA, cites Myers’s research as being instrumental in the AMTA creating a robust judging system. Going on to say that the research and the training Myers has provided online has fundamentally changed how the sport is judged in New Zealand, improved the quality of judging, and the standard of those competing in Muay Thai significantly \(S5\). 

 **Ongoing UK influence** 

 Darren Phillips \(S2\), Jesse Saunders, Stephen Meikle, Stephen Strotmeyer, and Mark DeLuca have been trained, assessed and now deliver Myers’s research\-informed training courses for officials across the UK and the USA \- guaranteeing the ongoing impact of his research on judging. 17 major promoters of professional Muay Thai events in England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, now only use officials trained and assessed by Myers or the judge educators he has trained. Other major promoters, who use ‘in\-house’ officials, also acknowledge the direct influence of his research and training \(S6\). 

 **Indirect impact** 

 Globally, there have been 11,278 views of Myers’s judging seminar online \(S7\) and talking through how to score a fight \(S8\). Myers’s academic articles focusing on judging and its impact on performance, have been accessed numerous times by academics and non\-academics Myers’s academic articles focusing on judging and performance, have been viewed more than 25,000 times by academics and non\-academics \(S9; S10\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our impact has been to transform the education programme of the General Federation of Trade Unions \(GFTU\). This work, underpinned by historical research from the University of Wolverhampton, has now reached all 200,000 union members across 25 organisations, enhancing both their personal development and career progression. Impact is evidenced through a major shift in the GFTU’s policy, which saw the inclusion of labour and social history in the organisation’s four educational principles. These principles underpin all training offered to its affiliated organisations, such as the Professional Footballers’ Association \(PFA\), the Musicians’ Union \(MU\), the Bakers’, Food and Allied Workers Union \(BFAWU\), and the Social Workers’ Union \(SWU\). The research and associated outputs have provided a robust yet accessible understanding of the history of the trade union movement, labour politics, and working class culture. This has enabled the GFTU to learn from historical precedents to adapt to changing economic and social contexts and enhanced its professional identity and purpose. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research is grouped under the three thematic headings and detailed below, with relevant references to outputs indicated \[R\]: 

 <ins>Labour Biography</ins> 

 Gildart’s research has provided accounts of the lives and experiences of key figures in the labour and trade union movement from the period of the industrial revolution through to the present day.  The research has demonstrated the ethnic, national and cultural diversity of the labour movement, the contribution of women, and neglected political traditions such as communism, syndicalism, spiritualism, and trotskyism in shaping workplace and community activism. It has also uncovered the changing methods of political organisation, activism, trade union advocacy and education across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Most importantly the research has recovered and contextualised histories of working class communities, identities, beliefs and currents often marginalised in earlier studies of the role of the labour and trade union movement in British society. This work was disseminated by research published in multiple volumes of the *Dictionary of Labour Biography* co\-edited by Gildart \[R1\-2\]. 

 <ins>Music and Deindustrialisation</ins> 

 Gildart’s research in this area has established the relationship between working\-class youth culture, the workplace, community, trade unionism, popular music and socio\-economic continuity and change in the period 1955\-1976. This work shows how popular music reflected and shaped working\-class experiences, culture, and the politics of the trade union movement in a period in which a number of communities were impacted by a rapidly developing process of deindustrialisation. Gildart has uncovered the links between deindustrialisation, class identities, popular music \(such as Northern Soul\) and the decline of trade unionism in the 1980’s and the 1990’s. This research was disseminated through R3, R4 and R6. 

 <ins>Coal Mining</ins> 

 Gildart’s and Perchard’s research placed managerial trade unionism in the British coal industry within the wider context of the changing nature of mining communities and the growth of white\-collar trade unions in post\-war Britain. It produced oral histories of miners that have preserved their memories and informed public knowledge of the workplace, communities, trade unionism, class and identity in British society. The dissemination of this work has forged new directions in mining history regarding the relationship between the National Union of Mineworkers, government, managers and individual miners and communities. The research on managerial trade unionism in coal mining has made a notable intervention in re\-thinking industrial relations in the coal industry in the period of public ownership from 1947\-1994 \[R5\]. 

 <ins>Knowledge</ins> <ins>Exchange and Research Collaboration</ins> 

 The research and collaboration between the University of Wolverhampton and the GFTU emanates from three substantial projects: The Dictionary of Labour Biography; Coal, Community and Class in Britain 1947\-1994; and Popular Music and Deindustrialisation in Post\-War Britain. The Dictionary project \[R1\-2\] was first established in the 1960s and has been led by Gildart since 1999. It has gained a global reputation as a major resource for historians of labour, trade unions and socialist organisations. Its impact outside of the academy has been significant and its contribution to knowledge inspired the GFTU to overhaul its educational ethos and place labour and social history at the centre of its programmes of study. This led to further substantial and sustained collaboration between the GFTU and historians at Wolverhampton on projects on former coal communities \[R5\]. The history of the British coal industry has featured in weekend schools, workshops, conferences and courses offered by the GFTU. The Popular Music and Deindustrialisation project \[R3\-4 and R6\] also generated collaboration between the GFTU and its affiliated organisations, including the MU and SWU. Such collaboration has led to the organisation of a Festival of Youth, an annual Radical Summit, weekend schools and special events where the link between music, work, and class had been discussed and debated by representatives from the GFTU, the MU, the PFA, the BFAWU, and the SWU.

 <ins>Grants</ins> 

 The collaboration between historians at Wolverhampton and the GFTU was formalised by a successful funding bid to the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\). The AHRC supported the research underpinning the project titled ‘On Behalf of the People: Work, Community, and Class in the British Coal Industry 1947\-1996’ with a grant of £655,000. A further project, ‘New Directions in Coal Mining History and Heritage in Japan and the UK’, has been supported by the ESRC with a grant of £43,484. The role of history in GFTU education was also confirmed by the creation of a specific PhD studentship in Labour History, supervised at Wolverhampton by Professor Gildart.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>I1. Influencing the design and delivery of the curriculum and syllabi in an educational institution</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>c</ins><ins>orroborating evidence \[C\] is indicated in text\).</ins> 

 Our research has directly transformed the design and delivery of the curriculum and syllabi of the GFTU Education Trust, which is based at Quorn, Leicestershire, and is the body responsible for the professional training of officers and members of GFTU affiliated organisations. As a result of our research, the GFTU introduced a fourth tenet to its code of practice for “educational principles” \[C1, C2, and C4\]. This fourth tenet was “to provide and develop an understanding of the political & economic context which has shaped, and which continues to shape, the historic development of Trade Unions” \[C2\]. This fundamental change to the culture of education at the GFTU came about following a series of meetings between the GFTU’s General Secretary and Executive Committee and historians from the University of Wolverhampton between 2014 and 2016. From 2016, the GFTU codified history as a foundational aspect across all of its educational programmes. The GFTU’s educational trust subsequently hosted a new programme of education, which included labour and trade union history \[C2\]. All workshops, not simply those that offer history\-specific content, now provide historical context, drawing on research from Wolverhampton, to explain the broader significance behind every aspect of a trade union’s work. 

 On 29 April 2017, Wolverhampton historians and the GFTU met again at the Peoples’ History Museum Manchester to monitor, refine and develop the ways in which the GFTU use labour history in their education programme. Gildart then spoke at their conference to over 100 delegates from 25 affiliated organisations and met the GFTU’s Executive Committee to discuss the continued impact of labour history on GFTU education on 14/15 May 2017. As the subsequent GFTU biennial 2019 report explained, “you don’t know where you are going, unless you know where you have come from, so an important part of our work is to keep history alive.” Without the input of historians from Wolverhampton and in particular Gildart, the GFTU’s education programmes would have neglected the significance of history when teaching the next generation of trade union leaders \[C4\]. 

 The General Secretary of the GFTU, Doug Nicholls, described the value and impact of historical research at the University of Wolverhampton as follows: 

 “We consider that the impact of this partnership within our organisation, and its knock on influence to 25 national trade unions has been immense and colleagues from the University are popular and welcome participants in our events and thinking.” \[C3\] 

 There is documented evidence \[C5 to C7\] that public understanding has been enhanced through active collaboration between historians from Wolverhampton and the GFTU. Through the education and training of the GFTU, which thousands of union members have accessed, our research has engaged a wide audience who have further developed their knowledge of labour, social, and working class history. 

 <ins>I2. Impact on Practitioners</ins> <ins>\(c</ins><ins>orroborating evidence \[C\] is indicated in text</ins><ins>\)</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 As a result of the changes to the GFTU curriculum, our research has furthered the cultural understanding of the trade union movement in the wider public sphere; and shaped the GFTU and its affiliates’ work on community events and their engagement with particular organisations such as the Friends of the Durham Miners Gala. Our research has developed the awareness, attitudes and understanding of GFTU members and affiliates and their ability to make informed decisions on particular issues around societal transformation and the changing nature of work. Their responses to contemporary economic and social problems have been improved by their engagement with historical research provided by historians at Wolverhampton. The research has informed political debate and activities that have challenged established norms, modes of thought and practices within the GFTU and its affiliated organisations. In particular, it has helped to reinstate women and ethnic minorities into contemporary trade union history therefore providing encouragement and historical exemplars to today’s diverse labour movement. 

 Having underpinned the change in the GFTU and its affiliated organisations’ culture of education, our research reached, in 2019 alone, 2,072 people from eight trade unions who attended workshops \[C3\]. Based on this success, a further GFTU affiliate, the SWU, has included trade union and labour history in their conferences and education programmes \[C7\]. 

 Historians at Wolverhampton have been particularly influential in shaping history\-specific GFTU workshops. These sessions are delivered through the ‘Our History, Our Future’ initiative and ‘Living History Day Schools’ \[C2\]. Gildart has personally hosted a workshop on ‘the Modern Trade Union Movement’ \[C8\], which interrogates the questions: “Where did we come from? What have we achieved? How have we changed, what did we contribute to society, what can we contribute further?” Discussion of these questions improves our understanding of the role of trade unions in twenty\-first Britain and empowers GFTU affiliated organisations to continue to play a key role in a diverse range of employment sectors. 

 Gildart organised workshops in collaboration with the GFTU using his work on labour biography and popular music at a number of the organisation’s ‘Radical Summits’ held in Stone, Staffordshire and led discussions at three of the GFTU’s biennial delegate conferences. Sarah Woolley, the General Secretary of the BFAWU and an attendee of several training courses, explained how the study of history’s in GFTU education offered a template for “good practice and ideas developed from them that have been taken forwards within \[her\] own union and others.” \[C5\] 

 The General Secretary of the SWU, John McGovern, explained how our research was particularly useful to them as a relatively new union. He notes that: 

 “\[Gildart’s\] talk on trade union history had the advantage of introducing \[labour\] biography to it and the response and active questions from members highlighted the interest in the work and trade union history. This is extremely important for us at SWU with being a relatively new union; formed in 2011 but now approaching 13,000 members. Many of whom are new to the trade union movement and its history.” \[C7\] 

 He saw immediate benefits that have shaped their approach to future activities and which address the discrepancy in society that means “political literacy is still very much absent from the education curriculum in all but the top private schools. This ensures politics remains the playground of the financially better off and while the sons and daughters of the higher echelons of society are educated in politics, the rest of us are not, creating a division within society.” \[C7\] As a consequence, the SWU have implemented a political literacy programme covering the History of Trade Unionism. 

 The current President of the GFTU and Assistant Director of Education at the PFA, Osher Williams, explained: “\[ *The Dictionary of Labour Biography*\] is a significant source of reference incorporating the often understated role of women and ethnically diverse elements of the labour movement.” \[C6\] The GFTU have used the Dictionary as the basis for a day school entitled, EA72 The Working Class and Issues of Race and Gender in Recent History \[C1\]. The President and Gildart are now discussing taking the collaboration forward to use even more history in the PFA’s public engagement initiatives. Our research has been particularly pertinent in helping the PFA to develop union\-led responses to issues of race and racism in sport; the PFA play a leading role in fighting racism in football and wider society. 

 The former President of the GFTU, former General Secretary of the MU and currently President of the International Federation of Musicians \(IFM\), John F Smith, described how Gildart’s research on popular music is immensely important in uncovering the role of music in the history of the trade union movement. In particular, he has highlighted the “cultural aspects of the Labour movement” following Gildart’s contribution to their Liberating Arts Event. He has noted the importance of labour history to the cultural activities of the trade union movement, hailing its “significant value to our federation \[IFM\] and its wider membership.” \[C9\] 

 Research by historians at the University of Wolverhampton has transformed the educational curriculum of the GFTU and its affiliated organisations. Moreover, it has inculcated an interest in labour and social history across a broad swathe of union members. For some, this has been life changing with many now pursuing further study in colleges and universities. Overall, our research has enhanced the GFTU’s awareness of the history of the labour movement and working class culture underpinning its approach to contemporary social issues. The impact of the University of Wolverhampton’s research in history has ensured that the GFTU, its affiliated organisations and members, are now better equipped to meet the challenges they face in the twenty\-first century.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Near\-continuous EPSRC research funding over two decades has produced a suite of advanced computational fluid dynamics \(CFD\) wave models. These tools have informed novel engineering designs for at least 40 major maritime infrastructure projects around the world, including two significant, award\-winning UK firsts. Littlehaven’s novel ‘floodtastic wonderwall’ has protected the town’s seafront from flooding since 2013 and helped to boost regional tourism. In Norfolk, a “sandscaped” defence now protects 400 homes and secures critical national infrastructure – a gas refinery and the country’s only gas pipeline connection to continental Europe – against erosion from a 1\-in\-10,000 year storm. The economic benefit from these two projects is approximately GBP62,000,000. In China, the models helped to design the world’s largest wave flume; experiments here have enabled authorities to plan and assure the safety of the Hong Kong\-Zhuhai\-Macau bridge over its 120 year lifespan.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Active in the area of free surface hydrodynamics for more than two decades, the Centre for Mathematical Modelling and Flow Analysis \(CMMFA\) at Manchester Metropolitan University has been at the forefront of research to produce high\-resolution models of complex wave dynamics, including the first to integrate the effects of water depth, wind and aeration. These advanced CFD simulations and codes have been applied to challenging wave\-structure interaction problems with applications in ocean and coastal engineering. The group has received unbroken funding from EPSRC and the EU, worth more than GBP3,000,000. The body of work is described in over 100 peer\-reviewed papers in internationally\-focused journals published since 2000. 

 Supported by complementary numerical and experimental studies at collaborating partner laboratories at Bath, City, Edinburgh, Hull, Imperial, Lancaster, Manchester, Oxford, Plymouth and Queen's Belfast universities, the researchers within CMMFA have led on the construction and validation of computational models of wave propagation and wave\-structure interactions. The group was first in the world to apply a novel and robust free surface capturing method for realistic engineering applications. This led to development of the AMAZON code, first described in 2000 **\[1\]** and since, further extended and validated. Novel and unique aspects of the models include the adoption of a Cartesian cut cell approach for complex geometry and/or moving/floating bodies. The models also use high resolution Riemann solver based methods – traditionally applied for aeronautical engineering problems – for automatically capturing water/air interfaces and potential sharp changes in the solutions **\[2\-3\]**. 

 The AMAZON suite of novel codes developed by CMMFA include: i\) a numerical wave flume based on the shallow water equations \(a depth\-integrated form of the Navier\-Stokes equations\) suitable for calculating wave run\-up in near\-shore regions **\[1\]**; and, ii\) a 3D numerical wave tank \(NWT\) based on the full multiphase incompressible/compressible viscous Navier\-Stokes solution in both air and water regions above and below the free surface which is essential for modelling violent waves hitting structures **\[4\]**. It is possible to model wave generation, steepening, overturning and breaking over a structure and to generate a full set of flow variables. 

 More recent research has refined these models and adapted open source CFD codes \(e.g. OpenFoam\) for extended functionality to include six degrees of freedom of body motions, hydro\-elasticity effects and aeration in breaking waves. These refinements permit the high\-resolution simulation capabilities at the core of the numerical wave tank concept. 

 The Manchester Metropolitan codes address many of the limitations of other techniques. Contemporaneous diffraction models and potential flow codes were not suitable for modelling breaking waves whilst previous CFD\-modelling, based on the full Navier\-Stokes equations, did not include compressible phenomena, such as aeration and cavitation. This is crucially important in quantifying loadings under extreme wave conditions in which structures must survive **\[4\-5\]**. To address the high computational cost associated with the full Navier\-Stokes solutions, a zonal CFD approach \(domain decomposition\) has been implemented within the numerical wave tank, which combines a hierarchy of flow solvers, ranging from fully non\-linear potential theory to incompressible and compressible Navier\-Stokes flow solvers. The developed numerical wave tank solver has been parallelised to run on high\-performance computer clusters including graphics processing units \(GPUs\) with substantially reduced computational run time **\[5\]**. In addition, to model potentially large amplitude and arbitrary motion of floating structures under extreme wave conditions, overset grid\-based methods and focused wave groups based on the New Wave theory \(NWT\) have been applied within the NWT **\[6\]**. 

 The development of the CMMFA fully\-nonlinear multiphase NWT code, with enhanced functionalities and improved computational efficiency, is a key breakthrough in providing a tool to understand better the complex physics involved in violent wave impacts at structures that could lead to structural damage and even loss of life in extreme cases.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In the IPCC *Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate* \(2019\) scientists concluded that extreme coastal flooding, previously expected only once every 100 years, could become annual events by 2050. Further analysis for the UK has shown that large swathes of Norfolk and the East Coast are at significant risk, especially when rising sea levels combine with rough seas and high tides. Urgent innovation in the engineering of coastal defences is vital to protect coastal communities most at risk – or at least buy time before large\-scale evacuation is inevitable. 

###  Changing commercial coastal engineering design practice and cost savings 

 A former Manchester Metropolitan PhD student promoted the use of the AMAZON shallow water code \(see reference \[1\]\) in Dutch engineering firm Royal HaskoningDHV \(RHDHV\) **\[A\]**. According to the company’s Technical Director, Maritime and Aviation, RHDHV has now used AMAZON in approximately 40 coastal defence and infrastructure projects \(20 since 2013\), including some flagship and award\-winning innovations that are now protecting UK communities and critical national infrastructure against flooding and erosion due to rising sea levels and storm surges caused by climate change. The code enables complex modelling that is not possible or is too expensive using current gold standard CFD or physical flume experiments. Use of AMAZON saves approximately GBP50,000 for physical modelling and GBP15,000 for off\-the\-shelf CFD per project \(up to GBP1,300,000 total savings across 20 projects since 2013\) **\[A\]**. 

###  An award winning, UK first: the Bacton Sandscaping project 

 The firm used AMAZON simulations to inform the design of a UK first: the GBP20,000,000 Bacton Sandscaping project in North Norfolk **\[A\]**. After a 1\-in\-100 year storm surge in December 2013, the land between the Bacton gas terminal and the sea was severely eroded, leaving just 15 metres between it and the sea **\[B\]**. The terminal is considered to be the UK’s most important energy hub; it processes one\-third of the country’s natural gas supplies and is the terminus of the UK’s only gas supply lines from continental Europe. As such, it is designated to be a critical national infrastructure. The increasing risk of storm surges and rising sea levels were a threat to hundreds of homes in the nearby villages of Bacton and Walcott being lost to the sea **\[B\]**. 

 RHDHV proposed a ‘sand engine’ to replenish the beach and roll it back to how it looked 30 years ago. AMAZON simulations determined the required beach recharge crest level to ensure that the designed beach profile would withstand erosion by maritime storms **\[A\]**. Construction was completed in August 2019, after 1,800,000m<sup>3</sup> sand \(half the volume of Wembley Stadium\) had been pumped and ‘sandscaped’ along a 6km stretch of the coast. At its highest level, the new beach and dune stands 7m above previous levels and extends as much as 250m out to sea **\[B\]**. It is specified to protect against a 1\-in\-10,000 year storm. The significance of the project was highlighted by the RHDHV project manager who told the BBC *“The problem is so big and so unsolvable that it needs something radical like this”* **\[C\]**. 

 The completed work now provides 400 homes \(2,000 residents\) and the gas terminal with 15\-20 years protection against erosion and flooding. Following high, stormy seas in the autumn of 2019, a council spokesperson said that the sandscaping had protected homes in the area, stating, *“Had the beach nourishment scheme not been undertaken, it is likely that high tides would have overtopped the sea wall, and homes and businesses along the stretch from Walcott to Bacton would have been under a very real flood risk”* **\[B\]**. One property developer has already submitted a planning application for new\-build homes, stating that the sandscaping work had pushed back the 100\-year erosion line by 25 years **\[D\]**. 

 The project delivers calculated total economic benefits of approximately GBP33,000,000 for the two villages and nearby roads at risk **\[E\]**. The project’s significance to UK energy security is evident in remarks from one energy analyst that *“any disruption at the Bacton terminal would have huge ramifications. On the wholesale market, price increase would be astronomical. The energy security of the UK would be threatened”* **\[B\]**. 

 Since completion, the project has won or received commendations in five regional and national awards, including the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment \(IEMA\) Sustainability Impact Awards 2020, New Civil Engineer 100 Awards 2019 and Flood and Coast Awards 2020 **\[A\]**. This cross\-sectoral recognition is an indicator of the significance of the project and its innovation for UK coastal engineering and climate resilience management. 

 The Bacton project has been so significant and successful that RHDHV is now working with the Environment Agency, Crown Estates and local authorities, and is using AMAZON as part of investigations on the potential for sandscaping to protect 20 additional sites in the UK, including the Mount’s Bay Marine Conservation Zone in Cornwall **\[A,F\]**. 

###  Flood protection for Littlehaven: attracting tourists and keeping business open 

 AMAZON was also used during the design of the new Littlehaven promenade and sea wall to study wave overtopping and flood risk to the town during high seas and storms. Damage to the sea wall was causing frequent flooding along the front, leading to closure and loss of income for local amenities. Proposed seawall designs could not be represented in EurOtop, the industry ‘standard’ overtopping calculation tool by the Environment Agency, and it was too costly to use full CFD or physical modelling. The AMAZON shallow water solver was, again, the suitable and affordable solution **\[A\]**. 

 Also known as the ‘Flood\-tastic Wonderwall’, the GBP5,000,000 project replaced a more traditional ‘vertical’ flood wall with a softer, more aesthetically appealing coastal defence system. The AMAZON simulations helped with the innovative design, and modelled the impact of retreating the seawall by 50m to make more use of natural beach **\[G\]**.The project won four national awards in 2014 and 2015, including one from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the ‘Design for a Medium Scale Development’ and ‘Climate Change Adaptation’ categories in the Landscape Institute Awards 2015 **\[G\]**. 

 The significance of the wall to Littlehaven was confirmed during the December 2013 North Sea storm surge, two months before the project was actually completed, when sea levels rose a record\-breaking 4m \(a 1\-in\-450 year event\). Waves reached only halfway up the new wall with some breaking water and spray in the top half **\[G,H\]**. Responses to FOI requests confirm that no flooding has occurred since completion of the wall in 2014, including during the October 2019 storms and high tides. The benefits appraisal of the project calculates the net present value benefit of approximately GBP29,000,000 \(compared with “do nothing”\) **\[H\]**. 

 A key legacy of the project will be to reinvigorate and grow the town’s attraction as a seaside resort. Tourism contributes GBP331,000,000 to the local economy and supports over 3,000 jobs in South Tyneside *“so any activity to ensure its position as a popular destination, such as the Littlehaven Promenade project, is very important”* \(South Tyneside Council\) **\[H\]**. The promenade has become a visitor attraction and is now accessible all year round, extending the tourist season and the duration of visits to the town \(with a benefit to local businesses\). Visitor numbers to the borough have risen from 5,511,000 visitors in 2012 to approximately 6,592,000 visitors in 2018 \(latest figures\) **\[H\]**. 

###  Design of the world’s largest wave flume 

 The Tianjin Research Institute for Water Transport Engineering, China, used the AMAZON code to study the piston wave\-making power during design of the world’s largest wave flume facility; calculations were not possible using published literature. The flume was constructed between 2010 and 2014 at a cost of RMB180,000,000 \(01\-2014\). It is the world’s most powerful wave flume and can reproduce 16m high waves and 10m high tsunamis at various scales. 

 Since opening, the flume has produced over 1,000 hours of experimental data in 18 live projects, including experimental studies of scouring around the piles of the Hong Kong\-Zhuhai\-Macao Bridge, the world’s longest sea\-crossing structure. During construction of the bridge, concerns about scour around supporting piles emerged as the effect was not as previously predicted. Thanks to the piston, large\-scale experiments helped to minimise scale effects; findings improved the prediction of scour processes and hence, evidence\-based safety measures to protect the supporting piles throughout the bridge’s 120\-year design life **\[I\]**. 

###  Supporting uptake of advanced CFD and wave modelling in industry 

 Under its ‘Software as an Infrastructure’ initiative, in 2015, EPSRC awarded a consortium, including Manchester Metropolitan, with funding to develop a national numerical wave tank community to drive forward adoption of advanced numerical modelling, CFD coding and high\-resolution simulation methodologies, such as those pioneered at Manchester Metropolitan. The Collaborative Computational Project in Wave Structure Interaction \(CCP\-WSI\) consortium \(see Section 3\) has built critical mass and delivered a return on EPSRC’s sustained research investment through upskilling and transfer to industry. Knowledge, skills and expertise have been shared through activities including cross\-sectoral road\-mapping, training and hackathons **\[J\]**. Since its launch, the community has grown to 169 members \(from academia and industry\) collectively producing 510 commits to the code repository **\[J\]**. Collaboration across the community completed development of wsiFoam, an open source numerical modelling tool based on OPENFOAM, first developed by Manchester Metropolitan \(see EP/K037889/1, Section 3\) **\[J\]**. The significance of CCP\-WSI’s academia\-industry support and training ecosystem is evidenced by its successful expansion and the award in 2020 by EPSRC of an additional GBP312,512 funding for a second 5\-year period \(2020\-2025\) *“to build on impacts”* \(Grant ref: EP/T026782/1\) **\[J\]**. The expanded consortium includes partners from across Europe, Australia, Japan, India, Hong Kong and China. Nine industrial partners include multinationals like Airbus Group, large engineering consultancies, and several offshore energy firms. The initiative is now tasked *“to accelerate development of Fully Coupled Wave Structure Interaction \(FCWSI\) modelling suitable for dealing with the latest challenges in offshore and coastal engineering”* **\[J\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> is an award\-winning Geographic Information System \(GIS\)\-based domestic energy mapping software. It can rapidly and accurately identify appropriate dwellings for area\-based energy retrofits at a neighbourhood or city scale. It does this by combining a spatial\-mapping\-based, data\-driven approach with innovative data\-reduction techniques. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> creates energy models and assesses the potential for energy retrofit measures on a house\-by\-house basis, which is then scaled up to cover a much larger urban area. 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model has provided a range of environmental, public policy and practice benefits to low\-carbon community organisations, local authorities, architects and householders. These local, national and international benefits have been achieved through: 

-  influencing the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\)’s refined Global Common Carbon Metric \(CCM\) approach 

-  enabling the development of British Standards Institution \(BSI\) standards 

-  facilitating a range of powerful public engagement initiatives 

-  making real energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions \(over 50%\) through energy retrofit measures in existing housing. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Rajat Gupta, Director of both the Low Carbon Building Research Group and Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development at Oxford Brookes University, combined energy modelling and spatial mapping to create the RIBA\-award\-winning \(2006\) Domestic Energy, Carbon Counting and Carbon Reduction Model \(DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>\). DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> is unique in bringing together GIS techniques \(based on MapInfo GIS\) and the Building Research Establishment’s Domestic Energy Model \(BREDEM\-12\). It can rapidly measure, model, map, manage and track domestic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions house by house, and also collect and visualise results on an urban scale, to help local authorities plan area\-based energy retrofits. 

 The background calculations of DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> are performed by BREDEM\-12 and Standard Assessment Procedure \(SAP 2009\), which are dynamically linked. To inform the model, actual home characteristics are gathered from historic and current maps, on\-site street surveys, occupant questionnaires and literature describing home characteristics based on age and typology. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> uses data reduction techniques to assess baseline energy use and evaluate energy savings. It can also assess CO<sub>2</sub> reductions and the cost\-effectiveness \(using life\-cycle costing\) of applying best\-practice energy efficiency strategies and low/zero\-carbon technologies in existing housing for current **\(R1\)** and future climate **\(R2\)**. 

 As part of the **ESRC/EPSRC**  [EVALOC low carbon communities](http://www.evaloc.org.uk/) project \(PI: Gupta, Researcher: Gregg, 2011–2015, GBP1,144,509, ES/I006664/1\) led by Professor Gupta in collaboration with Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, the researchers worked in partnership with six communities who took part in the Department of Environment and Climate Change \(DECC\)’s \(now DBEIS\) GBP10,000,000 Low Carbon Communities Challenge \(LCCC\) programme. EVALOC assessed and explained changes in energy use in the participating communities as a result of their LCCC activities, looking at individual dwellings and the wider community. To help community groups reduce energy use, DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> was used to measure, visualise and communicate energy use for over 1,800 dwellings, both before and after community energy projects. It was also used to predict future carbon savings across the six communities **\(R3\)**. The carbon maps created by the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model gave the local community energy group, local authority and householders visual feedback about energy use. It also provided evidence of community action, and presenting carbon maps at workshops showed that others were also engaged in energy action **\(R4\)**. The EVALOC project also created an EVALOC eNergy And Communities Toolkit \(ENACT\) to enable better public access to briefings, case studies and technical reports arising from the project, including the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> approach and results. 

 Later, in the **Innovate UK**\-funded  [LEMUR](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=132027) \(Local Energy Mapping for Urban Retrofit\) project \(PI: Gupta, Researcher: Gregg, 2015–2016, GBP161,531, project ref: 132027\), the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was further enhanced. It was adapted to use publicly available national and local datasets on housing and energy to quickly identify suitable city neighbourhoods for particular retrofit measures, based on relative energy use and fuel poverty ratings **\(R5\)**. The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was then used to estimate energy use and potential for energy reduction on a house\-by\-house basis. This approach was successfully tested in the town of Bicester, Oxfordshire. 

 Building on the LEMUR project, the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was applied as part of the **EU ERDF**\-funded  [OxFutures](http://oxfutures.org/projects/) project \(Co\-I: Gupta, 2017–2020, the total value GBP1,599,810\) to identify fuel\-poor neighbourhoods with high energy use, covering over 2,000 dwellings in five district councils of Oxfordshire **\(R6\)**. The findings were used by community organisations such as Low Carbon Hub to increase take\-up of home energy improvements. Findings from the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–LEMUR project have been used to develop a county\-wide future energy planning tool in collaboration with Oxfordshire County Council as part of the **Innovate UK** Local Energy Oxfordshire \(LEO\) project \(Co\-I: Gupta, 2019–2022, the total value GBP13,788,087, project ref: 104781\). 

 DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research is being adapted for use in India, to build community energy models of 2,000 homes across five cities. It will be used to evaluate the potential for deployment of energy\-saving measures and rooftop solar, as part of the **EPSRC/Indian Department of Science and Technology \(DST\)**\-funded  [RESIDE](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/about-brookes/news/researchers-receive-major-grant-to-help-improve-the-energy-efficiency-of-millions-of-homes-in-india/) project \(PI: Gupta 2017–2022, GBP1,300,000 million: GBP772,178 from EPSRC and the remainder from DST, EP/R008434/1\) on residential building energy demand reduction in India.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model, EVALOC and subsequent research projects have had a considerable and sustained impact on environmental policy. They have also improved community and public engagement. Both of these things have improved housing energy performance. The following examples demonstrate these benefits. 

 **Informing policies and practice** 

 Principles of the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research have underpinned the development of tools, protocols and practices. Through his role as technical advisor, Professor Gupta piloted and refined UNEP’s Global Common Carbon Metric \(CCM\) approach through the Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative. The CCM protocol has been developed as an ISO standard on carbon metrics of buildings \(ISO/TC 59/SC17\) **\(S1\)**. As a member of the steering committee, Professor Gupta applied DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>’s principles of accounting carbon emissions from all energy end uses in dwellings in the BSI’s ‘UK PAS 2060 Specification of the demonstration of carbon neutrality’ **\(S2\)**, and this was taken up by nearly 100 organisations. 

 The EVALOC project was profiled as an exemplar case study in the DECC’s National Community Energy Strategy \(2014\), and DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> was highlighted as a carbon mapping tool that is key to helping community groups reduce energy use by measuring, visualising and communicating house\-by\-house energy use and the potential for carbon savings **\(S3\)**. 

 Findings from DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>’s research within the EVALOC and LEMUR projects have been presented regularly \(2014, 2015 and 2016\) to senior members of the Energy Efficiency Deployment Unit \(EEDO\) in DECC, and used to inform policy development in the field of community/local energy and household energy use. In September 2015, Professor Gupta was invited by Scottish Government officials working in the community energy sector to share the evaluation approach adopted in the EVALOC project. The action research approach influenced the Scottish Government’s evaluation protocols for measuring the impact of community energy initiatives. 

 The Construction Leadership Council’s Green Construction Board’s report **\(S4\)** explicitly highlighted the EVALOC tools and datasets \(created by the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model on monitoring and evaluation of household energy use\) and awarded them the highest score \(four out of four\) for future usefulness in understanding housing energy use. 

 **Improving community engagement** 

 The findings from the EVALOC–DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research have been used by community organisations and community energy projects. Community\-based organisations involved in the Eco\-Easterside project used evidence from EVALOC to support a successful funding bid worth £1 million. The participants who were provided with energy feedback in the six carbon mapping workshops were more motivated to adopt energy\-saving behaviours and to undertake further retrofit measures \(from draught\-proofing and re\-dressing the mortar joints in external walls, to fitting solar PV panels\). EVALOC fed directly into a collaborative Knowledge Exchange project \(Monitoring and Evaluation for Sustainable Communities\), which trialled a variety of EVALOC’s monitoring and evaluation tools to enable rapid learning among members of Transition Network and Low Carbon Communities Network **\(S5\)**. 

 The community engagement and household recruitment methodology developed in the EVALOC project were applied in an Innovate UK\-funded project, Energy Resources for Integrated Communities \(ERIC\), to encourage householders to store and share solar\-generated electricity. The ERIC project installed solar photovoltaic \(PV\) systems and smart batteries in 82 dwellings in a neighbourhood in Oxford, resulting in generation of 117 MWh per year \(over 25 years\) of solar electricity and increased self\-consumption of PV electricity from 51% on average to 65% per year. The project also won two prestigious national energy awards in 2016 **\(S6\)**. 

 **Extending public engagement** 

 Many public engagement activities, including workshops, advice stalls and open exhibitions, were undertaken throughout the EVALOC project. For a national interactive exhibition, ‘A Sense of Energy’, the EVALOC installation used thermal imaging and DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> carbon mapping to ‘visualise’ energy **\(S7\)**. Airbrushing the colours normally seen in a thermal image on to a doll’s house was an innovative way of demonstrating heat losses from a typical Victorian terrace, as well as providing recommendations on how to reduce them. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> carbon mapping showed the changes in a community’s estimated domestic household energy use, before and after local community energy action. The public exhibitions ran in London in July 2014 and in Cardiff from September to October 2014. In Cardiff, the exhibition included workshops and gave visitors the chance to talk to researchers. The EVALOC thermally imaged doll’s house installation has been used in local public events in Oxford, including the 2015 OUTBURST festival, where it attracted attention as part of the welcome exhibit aimed at designers, managers and developers in the construction industry. 

 The ENACT toolkit on the EVALOC website was devised to promote public access to the findings in easy\-to\-understand briefings, case studies and technical reports **\(S8\)**. The EVALOC website was viewed 5,231 times, with 612 returning visitors between March 2015 and March 2016. This is in comparison to only 2,645 total views prior to the ENACT toolkit being launched \(April 2012 to February 2015\). The visitors to the site are believed to be a mix of community practitioners and building industry personnel who are interested in monitoring and evaluating the impacts of community energy initiatives and energy retrofits. 

 **Achieving real CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions** 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> approach has been applied in advanced low\-carbon refurbishments of three Innovate UK\-funded ‘Retrofit for the future’ projects by Oxford Brookes University. Of these, one project \(Oxford Whole House Carbon Reduction\) achieved 80% carbon emission, with wide media coverage, and was the only case study profiled by Innovate UK \(formerly TSB\) in its ‘Retrofit analysis’ report **\(S9\)**. Through the DECC\-funded Local Energy Assessment Fund \(2012\), DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> enabled a local community in Bicester to prepare for the National Green Deal programme. During the assessment period, it allowed the community to assess the potential for applying costed refurbishment packages, based on a combination of best\-practice energy\-saving measures and low\-carbon technologies. Findings from the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–Bicester model were used directly to install cavity and wall insulation in 42 dwellings, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> savings of least 50tCO<sub>2</sub> per year **\(S10**\). 

 Since 2018, DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–India models in the RESIDE project have been developed to target the deployment of energy demand reduction measures \(insulation, shading, low\-energy cooling/heating systems\) combined with rooftop solar, across five Indian cities. Findings are being used to inform the assessment of the residential energy code that will impact the energy performance of 100 million homes in the next 10 years.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Exoplanet science has burst into the public sphere, with few scientific topics connecting as readily to an interested public.  Google alerts show the worldwide media writing about exoplanets every day. Much of this derives from the WASP exoplanets discovered by Keele, which are often the best planets to study. During the REF period the worldwide media have produced over 2000 articles talking about a WASP exoplanet. Major organisations \(NASA, ESA, ESO\) regularly put out press releases about Keele\-discovered WASP exoplanets, repeatedly resulting in widespread dissemination. During 2019 a ""Google alert"" about WASP exoplanets triggered on 95 different days. Third\-party content creators regularly expound on WASP exoplanets to large audiences. Writers across the world are writing about exoplanet science based on exoplanets discovered by the Keele\-led WASP\-South survey. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Ours is the first generation to know that almost all the stars in the night sky are orbited by planetary systems. The public interest in exoplanets is huge. A Google alert for “exoplanets” news items triggers nearly every day, usually with multiple items. The exoplanets that are best for detailed study are the transiting exoplanets \(enabling masses, radii, densities and hence estimates of compositions\) orbiting bright host stars \(enabling atmospheric characterisation\). A large fraction of these are the WASP exoplanets discovered by Keele. 

 The WASP project \(Wide Angle Search for Planets\) has now found 192 exoplanets transiting bright stars \( *V* < 13\), making it the most successful of the ground\-based transit surveys. While NASA’s TESS satellite looks for small, rocky planets, WASP has already found most of the gas giants that are most favourable for further study. Of the 100 best exoplanets for atmospheric characterisation \(bright host stars; large transit depths; large atmospheric scale\-heights\) half are WASP discoveries.  Half of the gas giants targeted for atmospheric characterisation by the *Hubble Space Telescope* are WASP planets. The $10\-billion *James Webb Space Telescope* \(launch 2021\) was built to characterise exoplanet atmospheres as one of four major science themes.  Seven of the twelve transiting exoplanets chosen for its *Early Release Science* program are WASP planets. 

 WASP is a collaboration between: \(1\) Keele University, who built and operated the WASP\-South transit\-search camera array, and led planet discovery in the Southern Hemisphere, \(2\) Queen’s University Belfast and the University of Warwick, who ran the Northern counterpart, SuperWASP\-North, \(3\) St. Andrews University, who were responsible for some of the WASP software, and \(4\) the follow\-up teams \(for which Keele/WASP\-South collaborated with the Geneva Observatory team led by Didier Queloz, who operated the Euler/CORALIE spectrograph, and the University of Liege with their TRAPPIST photometer\). 

 The Keele\-led WASP\-South has discovered 119 exoplanets, plus a further 39 in the equatorial strip jointly with WASP\-North \(while 34 WASP planets are Northern finds\). Keele is the lead WASP institute for the Southern planets, but we are also co\-authors and co\-discoverers on all the Northern finds, having contributed software, data analysis and expertise.  Keele University has lead\-authored more discovery papers for exoplanets transiting bright stars *\(V* < 12\) than any institute worldwide; and many WASP\-South planets \(WASP\-17b, WASP\-18b, WASP\-19b, WASP\-43b, the WASP\-47 system, WASP\-96b, WASP\-103b, WASP\-107b, WASP\-121b, WASP\-189b, etc.\) are among the most important exoplanets for ongoing detailed study. 

 From 2007 \(discovery of WASP\-1b\) to 2020 \(WASP\-192b\), the WASP project has produced 170 refereed papers that have been cited over 8000 times \(data from NASA’s ADS\).  Such is the interest in studying WASP planets, however, that by far the majority of papers about WASP planets are now by other research teams worldwide: there have now been 630 refereed papers about WASP planets, cited over 20,000 times \(ADS data\). 
","
###  3. References to the research \(indicative maximum of six references\) 

 Keele academics \(Hellier, Maxted, Smalley\) have authored 170 refereed\-journal papers related to WASP \(2006 to 2020\), now cited over 8000 times. Examples include:

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The discovery of the WASP exoplanets has led to a profusion of studies of those planets, resulting in widespread and sustained media activity reporting exoplanet science, and thus impact on the public in many countries worldwide.  Some of this media activity originates from Keele’s own press releases, but, as the WASP exoplanets get studied by astronomers worldwide, most WASP\-related media activity is now originated by others, featuring exoplanet science that was underpinned by Keele’s research in the sense that the discovery of a planet is the starting point for all subsequent study of that planet. 

 A **Google alert** for media activity mentioning a WASP exoplanet triggered on 95 different days in 2019 and 92 different days in 2020, with each such trigger typically reporting multiple media items \[1\]. Thus, major media outlets are writing articles featuring a WASP exoplanet at an average rate of once a day. This level of interest has been rising over the REF period \(2014 totalled Goggle\-alert triggers on 21 different days\). 

 The fact that exoplanets are designated after the discovery team means that one can readily link media activity to the underpinning discovery, and thus the extensive third\-party dissemination and outreach related to on\-going study of the WASP exoplanets qualifies as REF impact deriving from the WASP discovery programme \(while, in addition to the media activity featuring specific WASP planets, there is also a great deal of generic media content grouping the WASP exoplanets with those from other teams, an example being a NASA video celebrating the discovery of 4000 exoplanets, with 493,000 views \[2\]\). 

 **A NASA Tweet** about exoplanet WASP\-12b \(@NASA has 26 million followers\) gained 3700 “retweets” and 9100 “likes” in 24 hours \[3\], and led to a multimedia presentation on NASA’s outreach site \(comments included: “ *That’s amazing\!”, “I wish we had more budget allocated to NASA*”, “ *This is a nuts exoplanet*” and “ *I wish NASA had a third of the military's funding. Imagine the possibilities\!*”\). Similarly, a NASA Tweet about WASP\-39b gained 1700 retweets and 6500 likes \(“ *Wonderful … Love learning new things\!*”\).  Another NASA Tweet of a video featuring a *Hubble* observation of WASP\-107b has had 280,000 views with 3200 retweets and 10,700 likes \(comment: “ *Awesome, thanks Hubble\!*”\). A NASA Tweet about WASP\-121b had 600 retweets and 1600 “likes”.  Remarkably, in a recent Twitter search for “@NASAHubble exoplanet”, 8 of the top 15 Tweets were about a WASP planet.  The impact goes well beyond the English language; as just one example, a Tweet about WASP\-76b in the Thai language gained 4000 retweets \[3\]. 

 **YouTube videos** \[4\] by third\-party content creators can reach wide audiences \(we mention here only videos exceeding a million views\). A video from 2015, “10 strangest planets”, featuring WASP\-12b & WASP\-17b, has had 17,400,000 views with 233,000 “likes” and 30,600 comments \(“ *this is the first video that got me into astronomy and anything space related*”\); a second video from 2015, also featuring WASP\-12b & WASP\-17b has had 8,400,000 views with 114,000 likes and 12,400 comments \(“ *I wonder if species from other planets are asking themselves whether there is life on Earth?*”\). A 2017 video featuring a “virtual reality” tour of WASP\-121b has had 12,000,000 views with 175,000 likes and 5000 comments \(“ *what if aliens are different and don’t need water or oxygen?*”\). A 2017 video featuring the WASP ringed planet has had 1,200,000 views. A 2018 video featuring a WASP planet has had 3,400,000 views with 38,000 likes and 3000 comments \(“ *How do they know this if the planets are so far away? What kinds of telescope do they use?*”\). A recent video featuring WASP\-12b has had 1,230,000 views in less than 5 months \(“ *I’m learning more watching these in quarantine than actually going to school*”\). Again, the impact extends beyond the English\-speaking world, with Spanish\-language videos on the “strangest planets” theme \(and featuring a WASP planet\), having had views of 4,225,000 \(2017 video\), 3,830,000 \(2015 video\), 3,880,000 \(2016 video\), 1,768,000 \(2017 video\) and 1,320,000 \(2020 video\), where a total of 258,000 “likes” and 16,800 comments show engagement.  A 2017 Russian\-language video featuring WASP\-43b has had 5,100,000 views \(114,000 likes & 3700 comments\). There are similar videos featuring at least one WASP planet, each with views in the range 1 million to 4 million \(and totalling over 12,000 “comments”\), in French, Portuguese, Chinese, Indonesian & Japanese. 

 **Press releases** about WASP planets are documented on our WASP outreach website \( [https://wasp\-planets.net/](https://wasp-planets.net/) now averaging a hundred “hits” a day, and supported by a   [@WASPplanets](https://twitter.com/WASPplanets) Twitter account\) **.** Press releases from NASA, ESA, ESO & *Nature* usually gain worldwide attention.  For example, an ESA press release about WASP\-189b \(being the “first science results’’ from the CHEOPS satellite; Sept 2020\) resulted \(from a Google search\) in 50 English\-language articles in the UK, USA, Canada and Australia, and also articles in German \(Germany, Austria\), French \(France, Belgium, Switzerland\), Italian, Spanish, Portuguese \(Portugal, Brazil\), Dutch, Finnish, Slovakian, Hungarian, Greek, Polish, Russian, Latvian, Turkish, Persian, Korean, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Chinese. 

 Another typical example was a press release \[5\] in March 2020 by ESO in conjunction with *Nature* about observations of WASP\-76b with the new ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT.  The WASP\-South planet WASP\-76b is an ultra\-hot Jupiter whose discovery we announced in 2013. The ESPRESSO observations revealed that iron in WASP\-76b’s atmosphere is vapourised on the hot day\-side of the planet, to condense on the cooler night\-side, thus falling as “iron rain” at dusk.  A day after the press release, Google searches showed coverage on 54 English\-language news websites \(including, in the UK, coverage on BBC News, and in the Guardian, Independent, The Times, Telegraph, Sun, Daily Mail, Express, Metro, plus, in the US, CNN, Newsweek, Fox News, NBC News, plus media in Ottawa, Canberra, etc\). In addition, there were 22 articles in the Spanish media, 12 in French, 11 in German, 8 in Chinese, 7 in Dutch, and over 30 in 11 other languages.   Twitter activity by accounts with millions of followers \(@BBCNews, @nature, etc\) and many others then led to over 5000 Tweets and Retweets mentioning WASP\-76b. Indeed, after press reports of “raining metal”, a heavy\-metal band adopted the name “WASP\-76b” \[5a\]. 

 We track **media activity** using Google alerts \(documenting it on our  [wasp\-planets.net](https://wasp-planets.net/) website\). Listing only press releases taken up by major media outlets, bursts of media activity within the REF period include \(each with coverage on typically 50 news and science websites worldwide, often in multiple languages\): “Subtle signs of water on hazy worlds” WASP\-12b, WASP\-17b, WASP\-19b \(NASA/STSci/ESA\), “X\-ray view of WASP\-18b” \(NASA/GSFC\),  “Cousin planets of WASP\-94” \(Geneva/ESO\), “Changing face of WASP\-43b” \(NASA/STSci/ESA\), “Giant ring system” around WASP exoplanet \(Leiden Obs\), “Sunscreen layer in WASP\-33b” \(NASA/GSFC\), “Cloudy days on exoplanets” \(NASA/JPL\), “Stratosphere of WASP\-121b” \(NASA\), “Nature vs nurture” WASP\-67b & HAT\-P\-38b \(NASA\), “WASP\-12b: blistering, pitch\-black planet” \(NASA\), “Titanium oxide in WASP\-19b” \(ESO/VLT\), “Smothering stratosphere of WASP\-18b” \(NASA/GSFC/JPL\), “Spectrum of WASP\-39b” \(NASA JPL, Hubble/ESA\), “WASP\-104b darker than charcoal” \(New Scientist\), “Hubble detects helium in … WASP\-107b” \(Nature, NASA/STSci/ESA\), “Clear skies of WASP\-96b” \(Nature/Exeter\),  “Metals in atmosphere of WASP\-127b” \(Cambridge/IAC\),  “Water destroyed then reborn”, WASP\-103b, WASP\-121b \(NASA JPL/Hubble/Spitzer\), “Aluminium oxide in WASP\-33b” \(IAC\),  “Metals streaming from WASP\-121b” \(NASA/STSci\), “Sapphires and rubies in the sky”,  WASP\-47e \(Universities of Cambridge & Zurich\),  “Helium in WASP\-69b” \(IAC/Exeter\), “Dark sides of exoplanets” \(McGill Univ; 7 of 12 planets studied were WASP\), “Yellow skies of WASP\-79b” \(NASA/Hubble/Johns Hopkins\), “Water common in exoplanets” \(Cambridge University; 11 of 19 planets studied were WASP\), and “WASP\-12b orbital decay” \(Princeton\). 

 The greatest coverage for a third\-party press release was for a 2015 NASA/Hubble press release on the presence of water in the atmospheres of 10 planets \(6 of them WASP planets\) that resulted in coverage on 162 news websites \[6\]. The greatest coverage of all was for a 2014 press release by ourselves, on the discovery of WASP\-142b \(by Tom Wagg during a “work experience’’ week\), that resulted in coverage on 650 media websites worldwide \(205 in English, including BBC News, ITV News, CNN, TIME, The Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent, The Washington Post, Toronto Star, etc. plus 59 in German, 48 in Spanish, 106 in Russian, 30 in Chinese, 23 in French, 20 in Italian, and a hundred more in several hundred in over 12 other languages\), plus TV features \(see below\) and live Radio interviews across the world including CNN in the US, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Colombian National Radio, Australian Broadcasting Company, and RTE Ireland \[7\]. 

  

 The above compilation shows that institutions worldwide are disseminating exoplanet science underpinned by Keele’s exoplanet discoveries. Over the full REF period there have been over 2000 media articles mentioning a WASP exoplanet on websites of sufficient standing to be picked up by a “Google alert” \(English\-language only\). While half of these articles were reactions to press releases, the other half were journalists writing about WASP exoplanets even without the prompt of WASP\-specific press releases. Thanks to the NASA publicity machine and others, much of the overall dissemination about exoplanets that has now seeped into public awareness has been based on WASP\-discovered planets. 

 **UK TV coverage** featuring WASP exoplanets includes the BBC2 "" *Horizon: Secrets of the Solar System*"" \(3rd March 2015; audience 2.03 million\), containing a 14\-min segment about WASP\-84b and a segment on retrograde planets based on WASP\-17b. The discovery of WASP\-142b featured on BBC1 Midlands Today \(11th June 2015; 600,000 viewers\), BBC1 Breakfast \(14th June 2015; 3 million viewers\) and Sky News \(14th June 2015; 500,000 viewers\). The BBC2 “Horizon” programme, “ *The Wildest Weather in the Universe*"" \(24th Oct 2016; audience 2 million\), featured WASP\-33b as ""hottest known planet"", and discussed possible rain of ""liquid rubies"" on WASP\-12b. In addition, BBC4's *Sky at Night* \(16th Feb 2017; audience 600,000\) featured WASP as a successful hunter for exoplanets, while in Nov 2019 the naming of WASP\-13b featured on national BBC1, ITV and Sky news. 

 Non\-academic **books** explicitly featuring WASP exoplanets includes the popular\-level books “ *How do you find an exoplanet?”* \(John Asher Johnson, Princeton, 2015\), “ *The Planet Factory: Exoplanets and the Search for a Second Earth*” \(Elizabeth Tasker, Bloomsbury Sigma, 2017\) and the children’s book “ *Exploring Exoplanets*” \(Searchlight Books, 2015\) \[8\].  Universities are increasingly teaching undergraduates about exoplanets and textbooks \(e.g. “Exoplanets”, Haswell, Cambridge University Press\) feature WASP planets extensively. 

 **Naming the WASP planets:** In 2019 the International Astronomical Union launched a worldwide public\-outreach competition in which the youth of each nation named an exoplanet. Twenty countries were allocated a WASP planet \[9\]. In each country, schools and youth groups, involving tens of thousands of children, talked about that exoplanet and suggested a name, often a name from local traditions, giving an ongoing link between their culture and cutting\-edge science.  In the UK a 17\-page activity booklet for schools was produced by UCLan about the UK’s allocated planet, WASP\-13b.  A total of 515 school and Scout groups proposed a name. 15,000 then voted, choosing the Manx Gaelic “Gloas” and “Cruinlagh” for the star and the planet \[10\] \(a teacher reported the “mind\-blowing” effect of naming a planet on her class\). Similar campaigns were conducted in the 19 other countries naming a WASP planet \(Aruba, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Panama, Philippines, Serbia, Slovenia, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo and Turkey\). 

 The fact that so much third\-party outreach activity is about exoplanets that were discovered by Keele, with writers and content creators choosing to talk about WASP exoplanets as exemplars of exoplanet science, shows the worldwide impact of Keele’s exoplanet discovery research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 A focus on inward investment from international productions and deference to a traditional canon had stymied new, more diverse Moroccan filmmakers and diminished the significance of Moroccan cultural influence on world cinema. 

 The Transnational Moroccan Cinema \(TMC\) project generated new ways of thinking and has changed film cultural policy among Moroccan film industry professionals and academics. TMC brought together 100 Moroccan cineastes at a debate in 2016 which led key industry figures to develop a new film cultural strategy. It has enabled diverse filmmakers, particularly women, to be accepted into the canon. A pioneering feminist film, preserved by TMC, has been accepted as one of 25 films key to Moroccan history and internationally exhibited. Emerging filmmakers have been supported with professional development and routes to international markets. Throughout the project 70 young Moroccan filmmakers have benefited from workshops and opportunities for collaborations including residencies in London for two emerging talents to develop new projects.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research for this case study builds on Higbee’s work on transnational cinema. The key findings of this research \[see **3.1, 3.2, 3.3 & 3.6**\], propose that an exclusive focus on the national, or \(in the case of Moroccan cinema\) the francophone, is detrimental to the understanding of the production, distribution and exhibition of films. Further insights and findings emerged from the AHRC\-funded “Transnational Moroccan Cinema” project \(TMC\) \(December 2015 – December 2018\) and the follow\-on project “An Alternative Distribution Network for Moroccan Cinema: Online Audiences, Festival Networks and Transnational Talent Development” \(November 2019 – November 2020\). The TMC research project was led by Higbee \(PI\), with Prof Florence Martin \(international CI\) and Dr Jamal Bahmad and Dr Stefanie Van de Peer as Research Fellows. 

 While existing research, critical discourse and audience reception display a deference for the older generation of cineastes and the ‘canon’ of Moroccan cinema, there is a distinct lack of access to the history of Moroccan cinema for aspiring filmmakers both in Morocco and internationally. \[ **3.4**\] While the Moroccan Film Council \(Centre Cinématographique Marocain – CCM\) has the space to store old films on 35mm format, the facility is not future\-proofed. Furthermore, women’s films were specifically at risk of being lost through patriarchal canon formation and neglect. Higbee’s project has restored, subtitled and digitised one historically important woman’s film, *A Door to the Sky* by Farida Benlyazid \(1989\), and made it newly available for global screenings. *La Falaise* \(Besaïdi, 1997\) an artistically significant short film by one of Morocco’s most important contemporary directors, will be restored and digitised in 2021. 

 The CCM’s strategic focus had prioritised inward investment from international productions, to the detriment of Moroccan filmmakers \[ **3.3**\]. There was no network of support between different levels of the industry: funders, producers and filmmakers did not enter into meaningful dialogue and were not sufficiently supported by the CCM in realising international co\-production or exposure for their films. Meanwhile, younger Moroccan filmmakers looked outward, towards Europe and America, rather than exploring their own cinematic heritage \[ **3.4**\] and existing film education did not translate into viable career opportunities. Morocco’s main film festivals \[see **3.5**\] in Marrakech and Tangiers lacked opportunities for Moroccan filmmakers. Marrakech was criticised in 2016 for not including a single Moroccan filmmaker, while the Tangiers festival’s invite\-only format excludes those filmmakers who are not yet established. 

 The key findings outlined above have been disseminated by the TMC research team on the project website and via social media, in articles and book chapters, as well as a monograph and edited collection. Two international conferences \(in Marrakech in December 2016 and Edinburgh in October 2018\) for academics and industry professionals, offered a key space for knowledge exchange. Higbee was invited to present his research in Morocco \(Abdelmalek Essaadi University, Tetouan, in November 2019\) and internationally \(at HKU/CUHK, Hong Kong, in April 2018 and at HKBU in December 2018\). In November 2018 he served as president of the jury at the International Film School Festival, Tetouan.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Higbee’s work has increased access to the archives of Moroccan cinema globally; created opportunities for emerging filmmakers in Morocco; and changed awareness of, and interest in, Moroccan films on an international level for both audiences and industry professionals. Specifically, the following impacts have been achieved: 

###  1. Safeguarding and promoting works of historical significance 

 At the TMC conference ‘Morocco in Motion: the global reach of Moroccan Cinema’ \(Edinburgh, October 26\-28, 2018\), writer and director Farida Benlyazid revealed that her pioneering feminist film *A* *Door to the Sky* was stored at the CCM. The film had been considered “lost” as it did not have English subtitles and the French subtitles needed review, and the original 35mm film had deteriorated. Determined to make it available to a Moroccan and international audience, Higbee’s team shipped the film to the UK, where it was restored, subtitled in English and French, and digitised. It was then donated to the filmmaker and placed in the CCM archive in Rabat. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Higbee then persuaded the CCM to celebrate a world premiere of the restored film at the National Film Festival in Tangiers, for an audience of almost 300. \[ **5.2**\] It has since played at a number of international online festivals during the Covid\-19 pandemic, including the Africa in Motion Festival \(28/11/20, 57 views\) and the Being Human national festival of the humanities \(21/11/2020, 44 views\). Clear evidence of the film’s new lease of life as a result of Higbee’s work can be seen in its inclusion by the CCM in a selection of 25 films key to Moroccan film history that were streamed free online during March and April 2020 – viewed by 2,220 people in Morocco.\[ **5.2**\] 

###  2. Changing attitudes within and about Moroccan cinema 

 In December 2016, as part of the Marrakech International Film Festival \(MIFF\), in collaboration with the Moroccan Chamber of Film Producers \(MCFP\), Higbee organised a round\-table discussion about the state of the Moroccan film industry. The event was attended by more than 100 industry professionals and academics, including CCM director Sarim Fassi Fihri \[ **5.3**\]. At a time of perceived crisis for the Moroccan film industry \(with no Moroccan films having been selected for the MIFF\), it provided an opportunity to formulate a collective strategy. Key industry figures present committed to meeting twice a year in a forum that continues the initiatives begun by TMC. 

 *“After the Marrakech debates, we created a ‘National Coordination’, involving trade unions and professional organisations in the sector, aimed to set new priorities, and \[meet\] challenges such as the great one of winning back our own audiences and defining a cultural policy. We will continue this work and hope to bring more attention and confidence to Moroccan filmmakers.”*  – Ahmed El\-Maanouni, former president of the MCFP \[ **5.4**\] 

 At the Morocco in Motion conference, TMC invited a diverse selection of 15 Moroccan artists and industry practitioners to participate in a series of round\-table discussions in Edinburgh. Those who attended described how it had allowed a constructive debate to flourish: 

 *“Today I met people I did not have the opportunity to meet in Morocco. Thank you for having made this meeting possible, because I find this event priceless. It’s really exceptional to have the time and the opportunity to speak intelligently with so many people \[about Moroccan cinema\], to meet some of you for the first time.”* – film producer Lamia Chraïbi \[ **5.5**\] 

 Higbee’s research has led directly to greater international collaborations for the Moroccan film industry. Between 2017 and 2019, he consulted for UK production company Hurricane Films for a commercial feature film, *Beatrice and Her Father*, set in Morocco, advising how to navigate funding and co\-production and brokering meetings with their eventual co\-producer, Lamai Chraïbi. Shooting is due to commence in spring 2021. Hurricane Films have described Higbee’s contribution as ‘ *invaluable*’. \[ **5.6**\] 

###  3. Creating opportunities for emerging talent 

 Higbee’s research team organised debates at international film festivals between young and established professionals, enabling for the first\-time interactions between these different generations of Moroccan cinema. In addition, working in collaboration with the LFS \(2017\-2019\), Higbee delivered a series of pitching and cinematography workshops in Tetouan, as well as two residencies for emerging Moroccan filmmakers in London \[ **5.7**\]. Activist filmmaker Nadir Bouhmouch participated in both TMC conferences, and Higbee’s research team has promoted his work through online interviews and research publications. 

 *“It gave me the opportunity to meet filmmakers whose films have been influential and dear to me for so long. ... This has given me a renewed determination at a time when I was beginning to feel hopeless and isolated.”* – Nadir Bouhmouch, after the 2016 conference in Marrakech \[ **5.7**\] 

 Bouhmouch has since participated in the prestigious Venice Final Cut development programme and his latest documentary was selected for leading documentary festival Hot Docs \(Toronto\). Higbee has also introduced Bouhmouch’s work to a wider range of film festivals and filmmakers. As a direct result of Higbee’s recommendation to the festival, The Folk Film Gathering \(Edinburgh\) screened Bouhmouch’s latest documentary at the 2020 online edition of the festival, inviting the filmmaker to participate in a filmmaker roundtable, where Bouhmouch established a collaboration with renowned British documentary collective Amber. \[ **5.9**\] 

 French\-Moroccan filmmaker Sofia el Khyari found participation in the Edinburgh conference and the screening of her film *Ayam* at the AiM film festival \(see photo \[ **5.1**\]\) a similarly transformative experience: “ *I returned to Paris, with my head full of projects, inspiration and ambition\!\! … I can't thank you enough for inviting me and promoting my young work to everyone.”* \[ **5.7**\] 

 Higbee’s project promoted further transnational talent development through collaboration with the London Film School \(LFS\) and the International Film School Film Festival in Tetouan \(FIDEC\). Two Moroccan documentary\-makers spent a term in residence at the LFS in spring 2017, developing new projects \(see Janjague and El Hachadi testimonies \[ **5.7**\]\), while Higbee and a delegation of LFS staff and students were invited by Abdelmalek Essaadi University to participate in the third FIDEC festival in November that same year. They returned in 2018 and 2019 to deliver three further pitching and filmmaking workshops for around 70 young Moroccan filmmakers, providing significant support and feedback to those seeking national and international funding for projects. In 2018, Higbee presided over the festival jury **\[5.1\]**. 

###  4. Extending audience reach and challenging perceptions of Moroccan cinema 

 By collaborating with the UK’s leading African film festival, Africa in Motion \(AiM\), and its partner organisations over the past four years, Higbee has increased understanding of the significance of Moroccan cinema in an African context. More than 500 people saw Moroccan films programmed at the festival as a result of TMC’s involvement. AiM producer Justine Atkinson’s testimony explains that TMC’s influence on curatorial practices enabled *“audiences to navigate a carefully curated programme of film screenings and events, therefore increasing their knowledge and access to Moroccan cinema at a time of disproportionally low levels of public exposure to Moroccan films*”. \[ **5.9**\] 

 The number of Moroccan events programmed at AiM rose from two in 2016 to nine in 2018, while the Moroccan film *Transes* \(El Maanouni, 1981\) was picked up by two other UK festivals: Watch Africa Cymru, in Wales \(November 2017\), and Open Colour, in Bristol \(April 2019\). TMC also delivered masterclasses with Moroccan filmmakers and panel discussions following screenings, which introduced new audiences to Moroccan film culture, and positively changed attitudes towards North African cinema, which has often been seen as separate from sub\-Saharan African cinema. \[ **5.9, 5.10**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Algorithmic risk assessment purports to accurately distinguish high from low risk criminal offenders and to predict the risk of future misconduct. Depending on the assessment outcome, an offender may be denied pretrial release, exposed to a longer sentence, or refused parole.  Hamilton’s research has identified race, ethnicity, and gender bias as features of some such risk assessments. Exposing the ensuing potential for injustice has had tangible impacts on law, policy, criminal justice, and public discourse. Specifically, her work has: 

 \(a\) informed the sentencing update to the Model Penal Code; 

 \(b\) been used by governmental and professional bodies to gain an evidence\-based understanding of risk; 

 \(c\) shaped influential stakeholders’ policies and practices for evaluating algorithmic risk tools; 

 \(d\) led to material changes in a government\-authored risk tool, and directly informed a U.S. Congressional hearing on risk\-assessment; and 

 \(e\) stimulated public debate. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

###  Background 

 An algorithm is an equation that takes inputs to produce an output. Algorithms are presumed to be objective, reliable, and equitable. Algorithmic risk assessment presents therefore as a progressive response to criminal justice reformers seeking to reduce over\-reliance upon incarceration while protecting the public. Yet, little is known about these black\-box tools that tend to be shrouded in secrecy. Hamilton’s research questions the presumptions of objectivity. Her research employs interdisciplinary approaches, applying criminological and data science methodologies to legal and ethical frameworks. 

###  Underpinning Research 

 Three of the underpinning research studies \(Debating Algorithmic Fairness, The Biased Algorithm, The Sexist Algorithm\) **\[R1\-3\]** are mixed\-methods studies \(qualitative and quantitative\) of large datasets of defendants. All defendants had been assessed using COMPAS, one of the most popular algorithmic tools worldwide, with over 1.5 million defendants scored. The three studies analysed post\-arrest application of COMPAS to a sizable and racially diverse county in southern Florida. The analysis focused on predictive validity and measures of group fairness by race, ethnicity, and gender. Threat Assessment **\[R4\]** evaluates the state of four risk assessment tools designed for terrorists. Judicial Gatekeeping **\[R5\]** suggests best practice for judges \(and legal arguments for legal practitioners\) on the admissibility of a risk tool for sentencing, balancing legal and policy issues with scientific realities. 

###  Insights from Underpinning Research 

-  Many definitions of algorithmic fairness now exist, some inconsistent. Hamilton’s research shows how an algorithm in practice can comply with one group fairness definition yet violate another. Stakeholders need to be aware therefore that a proponent or critic of any specific tool may select the group fairness definition that suits their narrative **\[R1\-3\]**. Hamilton further shows that in a real\-world scenario when base rates of offending between groups differ, group fairness by several definitions will suffer. 

-  Hamilton’s research found that the COMPAS algorithm for general reoffending is not calibrated well and systematically over\-predicts recidivism for black offenders compared to white offenders **\[R1\]**, Hispanics compared to non\-Hispanics **\[R2\]**, and women compared to men **\[R3\]**. The degree of over\-prediction differs across the three categories. 

-  The papers contend, after a detailed review of the literature on ‘correlates to reoffending’, that two reasons for the poorer performance of tools are \(a\) a lack of culturally\-sensitive predictors \(e.g., the roles of religiosity and gender expectations are stronger for Hispanics\) **\[R2\]** and \(b\) a lack of gender\-sensitive predictors \(e.g., the roles of prior sexual victimisation, trauma, and parenting stress are stronger for women\) **\[R3\]**. 

-  Popular risk assessment tools produce significant error rates, typically preferring a higher degree of false positives \(inaccurately predicting high risk\) over false negatives \(inaccurately predicting low risk\), yet these rates vary by race, ethnicity, and gender **\[R1\-3\]**. 

-  Despite claims of certain developers of risk assessment tools designed to predict terrorist events, such instruments \(a\) actually are not recidivism prediction tools, \(b\) fail to follow best practice in algorithm risk tool development, and \(c\) suffer other significant flaws. 

-  Output **\[R5\]** is one of the first publications to provide detailed legal and practical advice to judges and practitioners on how to judge the acceptability of risk assessment data as evidence in civil and criminal cases. 

###  Summary 

 The research is a leading effort to identify the need for legal practitioners, stakeholders, and lawmakers to critically evaluate risk practices in lieu of the current state whereby the guise of empiricism has unfortunately implied that the science of risk is objective, unbiased, and fair. The outputs provide clear guidance on both basic and advanced critical methods, interpretable to those without a strong science background.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Hamilton’s research has been felt by people and institutions concerned with protecting justice and fairness within the criminal justice system. 

### 1.  Law:  Informing the Sentencing Update to the Model Penal Code \(MPC\) 

 The MPC is highly influential in codifying US penal statutes and interpreting criminal laws. A decision to revise the section on Sentencing with a provision for risk assessment was agreed in 2017. After requesting copies of her work on risk assessment, the Reporter responsible for comments and notes had a lengthy consultation with Hamilton **\[R1\-3\].**  Output **\[R2\]** is cited in the final Reporter Notes, outputs **\[R1\-3\]** are used to inform other parts of the Notes, and the consultation with Hamilton is formally referred to **\[S1\]**. Unsolicited qualitative feedback from the Sentencing Reporter was that Hamilton’s research and assistance “had been very helpful. It will influence how the Comment and Reporter’s Notes come out” **\[S1\]**. Beneficiaries of this impact are drafters and users of the MPC, including legislators, criminal justice officials, and legal practitioners. 

### 1.  Informing Policy: 

###  \(a\) Congressional Testimony 

 In 2019, Hamilton testified before the nationally televised Oversight Hearing of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and Implementation of the First Step Act \(invited by U.S. House Representative, Jerrold Nadler\) **\[S2\].** Communications with Counsel for the hearing confirmed that Hamilton’s research expertise was crucial to understanding potential issues concerning PATTERN \(a Department of Justice \(DOJ\)\) risk assessment tool released pursuant to the Act\). Beyond this, impact was felt by lawmakers, their staff, and the general public. Immediately following the testimony, a Congressional staffer wrote specifically to thank Hamilton for her contributions, confirming that viewers were “very positive about what we accomplished,” and that “Congress will keep you engaged” **\[S3\].** 

###  \(b\) Expert Panel, Administrative Office of the United States Courts 

 The Administrative Office of the United States Courts appointed Hamilton to its expert panel to the U.S. Courts’ Sentencing Resource Counsel \(one of two external members\). Her membership was for the purposes of “consulting on the use of risk assessments in federal criminal proceedings”. In this role, Hamilton assists leading policy analysts to educate individual counsel, lawmakers, prosecutors, and prison officials on the use of risk assessments, and the attending potential for bias. \(Hamilton’s appointment followed a plenary by her before the Administrative Office in 2020, based on **\[R1\-R3, and R5\]**.\) 

### 1.  Criminal Justice 

### 1.  Impact on the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers \(NACDL\) 

 A primary beneficiary of Hamilton’s research is the NACDL, a professional Bar Association with almost 40,000 member attorneys in 28 countries. In 2018, based on her work, Hamilton was appointed to the Task Force, as its subject matter expert. As a member, Hamilton has contributed documents to the Task Force’s library **\[R1\-R4\],** used to inform improved professional responses to risk assessment. In 2019, the NACDL commissioned Hamilton to serve as Reporter to the Task Force, authoring a White Paper to: \(i\) “educate criminal defense practitioners about Risk Assessment tools, as they are being used in the criminal justice system”; \(ii\) “provide strategies that may be employed in opposing or utilising RA tools”; and \(iii\) “provide the groundwork for NACDL to develop a policy statement regarding the use of Risk Assessment tools” **\[S4\].** The White Paper titled “Risk Assessment Tools in the Criminal Legal System – Theory and Practice: A Resource Guide” \(120 pages\) was publicly released with press notices **\[S8\]** and accepted as NACDL’s formal guidance in 2020. It includes significant references to **\[R1\-R4\]**. 

### 1.  Federal Public and Community Defenders \(FD\) 

 The FD comprise publicly appointed defence counsel for criminal defendants in the United States’ federal justice system. Based on **\[R1\-R3\],** the Sentencing Resource Counsel Project of the FD consulted Hamilton on the DOJ risk assessment tool, PATTERN. With particular focus on how tools can exploit socio\-demographic characteristics, Hamilton’s contributions informed the FD’s written and oral submissions to the DOJ. Several of Hamilton’s suggestions elicited improvements to PATTERN as indicated in the updated DOJ Report \(including, adding a decay function for infractions, employing independent evaluators, bolstering review committee involvement, eliciting user buy\-in\). 

### 1.  International Corrections and Prisons Association \(ICPA\) 

 The ICPA is an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. Hamilton was appointed to the ICPA Task Force on Women and Community Corrections in 2019. Upon request, Hamilton spearheaded a survey gathering evidence about the efficacy of women\-sensitive risk and needs assessment. Beneficiaries of survey results are prison officials, probation, forensic mental health practitioners, and prisoners. 

### 1.  Impact Resulting from a Roundtable on Risk Assessment in Sentencing 

 The Koch Foundation, \(a non\-profit advocate for criminal justice reforms to reduce the U.S. prison population\) invited Hamilton as an expert to its 2020 roundtable on legal, ethical, and empirical issues surrounding risk assessment in sentencing **\[S5\].** Output **\[R5\]** is among the experts’ papers to the Roundtable that form a special, policy\-centric issue of Behavioral Sciences and the Law. The leading editor’s introduction to the issue, expressly refers to Hamilton’s work **\[R1\-3\]** as receiving strong attention from the Courts. 

 **The foregoing impacts establish Hamilton as a leading national and international resource for evaluating risk assessment practices, and the challenges they pose to fairness and justice.** 

### 1.  Informing Professional and Public Debate 

 Hamilton’s work has had extensive further impacts on professional and public debate about risk assessment, including in the UK.  **Notably Hamilton was commissioned to write a White Paper on the Effectiveness of Sentencing Options \(incorporating risk assessment\) published on the \(UK\) Sentencing Academy website \[S9\].** Moreover, Hamilton’s research has led to invited presentations by diverse interested professional bodies: in summer 2020 a policy analyst with the U.K. College of Policing engaged Hamilton in discussions about how her research informs the country’s initiatives in emerging risk assessment practices, particularly those regarding predicting domestic abuse perpetration and victimisation. 

 Hamilton’s work has sparked media interest, bringing these important controversies about fairness and justice to public audiences:  based on **\[R1\-3\],** Hamilton appeared on radio news broadcasts \(NPR, Thinkwingradio\). She has also corresponded on issues of risk with reporters for the New York Times, Washington Post, Austin American\-Statesman, and Dallas Morning News. Output **\[R2\]** was the subject of blog posts **\[S7\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Lloyd and Oliver’s research into the long\-term athletic development of children and adolescents has informed policy and practice nationally and internationally. Nationally it has underpinned the development and delivery of industry\-leading coach education and athlete development programmes spanning National Governing Bodies and professional sports. Internationally it has informed guidelines on youth resistance training and long\-term athletic development for organisations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. It has also been integral to the development of a textbook to underpin the American College of Sports Medicine’s Youth Fitness specialist certification, the largest certification programme of its kind in the world.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the last 10 years, researchers from Cardiff Metropolitan University have been at the forefront of research examining the physical development of children and adolescents and the interaction between training, growth and maturation. The research examines the role of growth and maturation on the development of physical fitness and the reduction of injury risk in youth populations. Collaborations with national and international associations, National Governing Bodies \(NGBs\) of sports, schools, and professional sports clubs have been central to the programme of research and body of empirical research, narrative reviews, and position statements that underpin this impact case study. Collectively, the research has directly influenced policy and practice and stimulated subsequent scientific enquiry. 

 The importance of incorporating the interaction of growth, maturation and training to optimise the trainability of youth was initially signalled by the publication of the Long\-term Athlete Development \(LTAD\) model by Istvan Balyi and colleagues in 2004. While the LTAD model was quickly popularised among leading NGBs in the UK and abroad, a seminal review published by Lloyd and Oliver in 2011, challenged the scientific underpinnings of the model \[R1\]. Specifically, the theory of “windows of opportunity”, in which children must target specific modes of training at particular stages of development, or risk not reaching their full athletic potential, and the need to accumulate 10,000 hours of extensive training. Nearly a decade later, this review remains the fourth most read paper of all time in the *Journal of Sports Sciences* \(>68,971 reads\), was republished in the journal’s 30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Edition of ground\-breaking research, and was instrumental in initiating debate among researchers and practitioners as to the most appropriate training approaches for youth. 

 Following the review, Lloyd and Oliver published the Youth Physical Development model \[R2\], an alternative model of training, which unlike its predecessor, was based upon a large body of empirical research. The central tenets of the model were that: children and adolescents are able to realise meaningful improvements in a range of fitness components, irrespective of their stage of maturation; exposure to developmentally appropriate training including muscle strengthening activities should start in early childhood; and, training structure should increase over time. Since its publication in 2012, the manuscript remains the *Strength and Conditioning Journal’s* second most read and second most downloaded paper of all time. Subsequent research by Lloyd and Oliver, including that which examined interactions between maturity status and training responsiveness in children and adolescents, provided further empirical support for the Youth Physical Development model \[R3, R4\]. This research also proposed the concept of “synergistic adaptation” which reflects the benefits of complementing training stimuli with the adaptive processes experienced as part of natural development. This concept has received >60 citations within the field of paediatrics and was acknowledged in the annual review of the *Pediatric Exercise Science* journal as one of the leading findings in the field of paediatric neuromuscular physiology and training for the year 2018. 

 In a sizeable body of subsequent research, Lloyd and Oliver also examined the influence of maturation on key risk factors of lower limb injury. Research part\-funded by the Union of European Football Associations \(UEFA\) and *Fédération International de Football Association* \(FIFA\) revealed how neuromuscular control is altered as a result of fatigue in young female soccer players at different stages of maturity \[R5\]. These findings have helped inform maturity\-specific injury prevention programmes and fed into the UEFA B Licence Coach Education Programme. More recent research with Premier League soccer academies into the influence of maturation and neuromuscular function on injury risk in young male players identified a number of factors associated with injury risk in this population \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The influence of the research into the long\-term athletic development of children and adolescents has been evidenced nationally and internationally through its impact on athlete certification and coach education programmes, and change to policy and practice: 

 1\) The most prestigious and far reaching evidence of international impact comes from **Lloyd** and **Oliver** being invited to co\-author a seminal text for the American College of Sports Medicine \(ACSM\); *The Essentials of Youth Fitness* \[E1a\]. Published by Human Kinetics in late 2019, and heavily influenced by **Lloyd** and **Oliver’s** research and the Youth Physical Development model, the textbook serves as the core text for the ACSM Youth Fitness Specialist certification programme, the first ever globally recognised youth training qualification \[E1b\]. In addition, based on the content of the textbook Human Kinetics have developed a suite of continuing education materials \(including an exam\) that are accessible via their online platform \[E1c\]. 

 2\) Since its publication in 2012, the Youth Physical Development model has been credited as “having one of the biggest impacts on how conditioning staff develop players in Premier League football academies” \(Premier League Head of Sport Science\) \[E2a\]. In football alone, its sphere of influence has extended across all levels of competition \(i.e. from grassroots to international\), influencing athletic development programmes and coach education curricula both nationally \(e.g. Premier League\) and internationally \(e.g. USA Soccer\) \[E2b\]. This impact has been mirrored in other sports and extended to informing the professional practice and development pathways of sporting organisations around the world \(e.g., Swim England, English Institute of Sport, Cleveland Indians Major League Baseball\) \[E2c\]. 

 3\) The research is also central to the Sports Coach UK \(now UK Coaching\) “How to Coach the Fundamentals of Movement” workshop, which was also adopted by Sport Scotland and delivered to coaches and teachers across all youth sports throughout the UK \[E3a\]. Similarly, the Youth Physical Development model is integral to the Level 2 Award in Multi\-Skills Development in Sport, designed by 1st4Sport Qualifications in collaboration with UK Coaching \[E3b\]. Since its launch in 2017, 4051 coaches have completed this award. In addition, bespoke resources drawing upon our research have been developed for Great British Cycling and Welsh Athletics to provide continuing professional development for coaches working with youth athletes \[E3c\]. Since their launch in the summer of 2016 and early 2017 respectively, 1830 delegates have attended the UK Coaching workshop while 232 coaches and athletes have attended the Welsh Athletics equivalent. The impact of the UK Coaching and Welsh Athletics workshops have also been integral to the procurement of two Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarships funded PhD studentships \(circa £144,000\) in partnership with Sports Wales and Wales Golf. The former will investigate the effects of an athletic motor skills training intervention delivered across Wales on the physical, psychological and sociological development of secondary school\-aged youth, while the second project will examine the effectiveness of strength and conditioning on golf swing performance in youth golfers. 

 4\) Our research has also helped shape professional practice through the publication of consensus and position statements. In 2014, **Lloyd** and **Oliver** co\-authored the International position statement on youth resistance training. Endorsed by ten of the world\-leading professional organisations from the fields of sports medicine, exercise science and paediatrics \(e.g. American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, Federation of Sports Medicine, Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine\), it led the American Academy of Pediatrics to change their policy on youth resistance training \[E4a\]. In 2015, **Lloyd** and **Oliver** were also invited by the National Strength and Conditioning Association to co\-author the inaugural position statement on long\-term athletic development, the first position statement ever published on the topic \[E4b\]. Despite only being published in June 2016 it has already become the second most read article on the journal’s website, is in the top 5% of all research outputs scored by Altmetric® and has been cited on more than 150 occasions. These position statements also inform the guidelines forwarded in the ACSM *Essentials of Youth Fitness* textbook. Significantly, the guidelines within the position statement have already been adopted by USA Ice Hockey, USA Soccer and USA American Football, to help inform policy and practice for the respective athlete development pathways. Recently, the Aspen Institute *Project Play* identified that cumulatively, these sports attract more than 4.5 million child participants per year.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Digital font design for writing systems of the world \('non\-Latin' scripts\) lacked widely applicable, publicly accessible methodologies that integrate language requirements, font technologies, and cultural acceptability. The research addresses all three aspects, making font design widely applicable and replacing proprietary, script\-specific, or ad\-hoc approaches. The work has influenced policy decisions at leading tech companies, transforming the reading experience of people across the globe. It has directly influenced Google and Adobe's development of software for the visual presentation of world languages and, through application in the design of specific typefaces, established open\-source benchmarks and standards for important non\-Latin scripts. The research has provided a design methodology that supports the digital restructuring of the type industry worldwide, as more languages require a digital presence. It has directly informed exhibitions and workshops which reach beyond the type design community to shape cultural understanding of world scripts. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Leonidas, Ross and Singh’s research explores the representation of world languages through their script systems, and how these are represented typographically through changing technologies. The research investigated challenges that arise from the design and distribution of non\-Latin fonts for majority and minority scripts. It addressed the presentation of language within digital technologies through an analytical framework that interrogates historical sources together with scripts as typographic systems. Research undertaken by Leonidas, Ross and Singh considers historical, cultural, social, economic, and technical evidence in order to: 

  -  analyse existing forms of scripts; 

  -  establish the constraints of previous mechanical reproduction systems on the representation of those scripts; and 

  -  inform the design decisions for developing new digital fonts. 

 Ross and Singh considered the technological constraints that have been crucial within a historical context in determining the appearance of text in South Asian typography \(used by approximately 20% of the world’s population\). They scrutinized relevant archives to map the transition of South Asian letterforms from manuscript to foundry type, to digital type, including the University of Reading's Non\-Latin Type Collection, to elucidate design decisions that either purposely or unwittingly shaped each stage of typographic practice. 

 Leonidas's research draws on an analysis of historical forms and particularly the early 19th century Greek types cut by Firmin Didot, to inform contemporary design processes and feed into standards for digital typefaces. In examining approaches taken by Adobe in developing large typographic families with Greek complements, Leonidas identified design challenges and font engineering requirements for solutions unique to digital technologies, such as the pairing of monotonic and polytonic Greek variants \(output 6\). 

 The research finds its application through collaboration with tech companies and the type industry. This has been achieved through projects with designers and type foundries, and through consultancy for tech companies \(for example, Ross on Adobe Bengali, Leonidas on Bickham Script Pro\). The application of the research is in the creation of fonts and supporting resources for contemporary digital environments across the full range of platforms: printed, screen\-based, and environmental \(for example, fonts for academic publishers and document design applications, fonts for mobile interfaces, and fonts for signage\). This engagement with industry ensures the relevance and applicability of the research to changing font technologies, delivery platforms, and the needs of readers. Ross's research and co\-design with Tiro Typeworks of eight Indian\-script typefaces for the Murty Classical Library of India \(Bangla, Gurmukhi, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Telugu\), published by Harvard University Press between 2014 and 2017, resulted in the first set of digital fonts in this range of scripts that meet the latest technological standards while achieving a high quality of visual design that respects cultural traditions.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact of the research resides in the adoption of its methodologies for the design of ‘non\-Latin’ fonts, an area of growing importance as applications increasingly support a larger number of languages and script systems worldwide. The research has been transformative of the approach to digital font design for ‘non\-Latin’ scripts. It has been adopted by major industry players and small start\-up foundries alike, thereby improving the reading experience of millions. It has also offered new routes to understanding world script systems through publications, industry engagement, and exhibitions \(E1\). 



#  Influencing policy 

 The research has influenced non\-Latin font policies at Adobe and Google. These determine how software renders languages across a range of different technologies and document types. The analysis of historical forms has provided the evidence base and examples of best practice required by software developers who would otherwise approach the problem from a purely engineering standpoint. Adobe and Google have embedded insights from the research to systematize their type design processes, and to provide a QA procedure for non\-Latin font development through: 

-  determining required character sets; 

-  using historical sources to confirm character shaping decisions and correct substitution/placement of characters \(script behaviour\); 

-  using document design analysis to confirm the range of font variants required for a script \(E2\). 

 The research team has distilled their findings into practical and applicable guidance for the design of  [specific typefaces in a course run for Adobe and Google engineers and designers called <ins>Type Design</ins> <ins>Intensive \(</ins><ins>TDi</ins><ins>\)</ins>. Since 2008, this summer school, curated by Leonidas, has offered access ](http://typefacedesign.net/courses/tdi/)to the Non\-Latin Type Collection and other historic material, and is regarded by tech companies as essential professional development for engineers, project managers, product managers, and visual designers \(E3, E4\). 

#  Establishing and distributing benchmarks and standards 

 Production of fonts informed by the research has established typographic benchmarks and standards for non\-Latin scripts. Standards in this industry are typically distributed through exemplars rather than stand\-alone documentation. The research has directly influenced exemplar fonts that have been shared with and by the font design community. Leonidas' research informed the development of  [<ins>Source Serif 2</ins> ](https://blog.typekit.com/2017/01/10/introducing-source-serif-2-0/)through designing character sets for historical and current Greek. Senior Manager for Adobe Type Development commented: ""The character sets, OpenType feature code, and other project data that have been developed through this collaboration between Adobe and Reading are shared freely and publicly on  [<ins>GitHub</ins> ](https://github.com/adobe-fonts)as reference material to help other font developers understand how to build fonts according to the specifications we have tested for ourselves” \(E5\). 

 **Cultural reach** 

 *Making high\-quality design publicly available* 

 The researchers' approach to typeface design has been applied and adopted by major publishers to benefit readers of academic and commercial publications in Indian languages. Ross's  [<ins>award\-winning fonts</ins> ](https://harvardpress.typepad.com/hup_publicity/2014/08/fiona-ross-wins-typography-award.html)developed for the acclaimed Murty Classical Libraries of India project for Harvard University Press provide historically accurate and culturally relevant fonts for non\-commercial use. The fonts use OpenType technology to support the complex shape substitution and positioning required for the correct display of these languages. Updated \('Tiro'\) versions are freely downloadable for the  [<ins>current Apple MacOS</ins>](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211240), and Google will offer them through its webfont service. The research is also communicated to design professionals through discussion in professional journals \(E6\). 

 *Default operating system fonts read by millions* 

 [<ins>Google's Noto typeface family</ins> ](https://www.monotype.com/resources/case-studies/more-than-800-languages-in-a-single-typeface-creating-noto-for-google)includes scripts for all languages recognized by the Indian constitution \(Noto Serif Bengali, Tamil, Devanagari and Gujarati, among others, have input from Reading researchers\). Noto is the default for email, SMS, and web browsing on Android phones, which comprise 91% of the 32 million smartphones shipped in India in Q1 2019 \(E7\). Another default operating system font co\-designed by Ross, Microsoft's Nirmala UI, continues to be expanded with South and Southeast Asian scripts \(E8\). 

 *Emphasising language and script to ensure cultural resonance* 

 The research stresses language and script knowledge as the basis of type design. It overcomes arguments that only native speakers can design for their own script systems and promotes the integration of language and script knowledge into the design process. This has been applied by new foundries such as  [<ins>Rosetta</ins>](https://www.rosettatype.com/)<ins>,</ins>  [<ins>Brand New Type,</ins> ](https://www.brandnewtype.com/)and  [<ins>Universal Thirst</ins> ](https://universalthirst.com/)\(set up by Leonidas' and Ross's postgraduate students\). These foundries rely on international collaboration. Commercially, they are able to offer fonts that are equal in quality and innovation to those used by brands in the West, achieving cultural parity with integrity. Examples are the Dhaka Art Summit 2020 with  [<ins>type designed by Universal Thirst</ins>](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/universal-thirst-graphic-design-141119), and new branding for the ABP news media by Brand New Type \(E9\). 

 *Enhancing cultural understanding of global scripts* 

 The research has contributed to enhanced cultural understanding through exhibitions and public\-facing events, Ross's exhibition, co\-curated with doctoral researcher Izadpanah, “ [<ins>20th\-century Persian newspaper</ins>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S639xAaho7o)  [<ins>types</ins>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S639xAaho7o): investigating the design process” \(Reading, May 2019\) attracted journalists, curators, politicians, and linguists, notably from the Iranian diaspora in the UK. It featured on BBC Persian, which has an audience of more than 13,000,000 Persian speakers worldwide and circulated online to a positive reception \(E10\). Ross's and Singh's 2019 workshop at the British Library, “Introduction to non\-Latin scripts”, for a general audience, led one participant to remark that it had led to a “deeper knowledge of Indian scripts”; and Ross contributed an  [<ins>online</ins> <ins>article</ins> ](https://www.bl.uk/early-indian-printed-books/articles/two-bengali-grammars-a-typographic-perspective)'Two Bengali grammars \- a typographic perspective' for the Early Indian Printed Books public\-facing website.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr David Holwell’s research led to new, geologically targeted ore\-exploration strategies and mining procedures for four mining and exploration companies in the UK, Greenland, and Zambia. This research contributed a total GVA of GBP408,804,900 to these companies and to regional economies by enabling mergers, accelerated productivity, and reduced capital expenditure; by leveraging regional investment; and through the creation of c. 500 jobs in an economically deprived region of Zambia. 

 In particular, the research facilitated the closed Munali Nickel Mine, Zambia, to reopen in 2019, producing 3,600 tonnes of nickel annually by December 2020, worth GBP37,546,750. It enabled ASX\-listed Conico to purchase Longland Resources, Greenland, in October 2020, worth GBP1,760,000. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since 2009, Dr David Holwell’s research has focused on developing new, strategic, geological search methodologies for reducing economic and energy costs in the mining industry. Mineral exploration is essentially a search\-area\-reduction exercise, with the aim of discovering a mineral resource. Making exploration more efficient in terms of generating targets, and reducing the search space in this ‘needle\-in\-a\-haystack’ exercise saves the minerals industry millions of dollars \(a typical exploration drilling programme is c. USD1,000,000 – 2,000,000\). Through collaboration with industry at every stage, Holwell has applied a multi\-technique approach that utilises a classic ‘source\-pathway\-sink’ scientific framework. Predicting where to explore for the ‘sink’ \(ore deposits\) relies on understanding the processes of source and pathway and being able to fingerprint them \[ **R1\-R5**\]. 

 In Greenland, the publication of work on newly discovered mineralisation and the identification of high potential for discovery of new copper\-palladium and gold ore deposits \[ **R1**, **R2**\] illustrates this multi\-technique approach. The publication \[ **R1**\] outlines the ‘fingerprints’ of a pathway, with confirmation that many of the source characteristics are there, and thus provides strong evidence of a sink \(deposit\). In addition, the discovery of the first gold mineralisation in east Greenland \[ **R2**\] has generated an exploration strategy to develop this deposit. Longland Resources \(now Conico\), set up on the basis of these findings \[ **R1**, **R2**\], is currently actively exploring the area for such deposits. 

 Holwell’s research at the Munali mine in Zambia \[ **R3**\- **R5**\] revealed that different parts of the orebody have varying metallurgical characteristics, including a copper\-rich zone \[ **R5**\]. Howell’s methodology has developed a new **mineral exploration technique** for nickel deposits \[ **R7**\]. Magnetite is a common mineral in many rock types, including those that host nickel deposits. But Holwell’s research showed that magnetite associated with nickel sulfide deposits is chemically distinct from other sources \[ **R7**\]. Thus, Holwell discovered that magnetite in soils can be used to trace the possible presence of *hidden* nickel deposits. Holwell’s novel research process defined a new exploration ‘fertility indicator’ for nickel mineralisation that can be picked up from *surface soil*. The results instigated a regional soil\-sampling programme by Consolidated Nickel Mines \(CNM\) around the Munali Mine, Zambia \(2015\-present\), which in one are identified magnetite with strong fertility indicators. 

 The application of automated mineralogy to informing mineral processing \[ **R6**\] has been applied at the Kitumba Copper Project in Zambia, where ongoing research since 2018 with ZEISS and CMI is providing key new information on the nature of a copper orebody that had been discovered, but had yet to be exploited.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Legacy mineral *exploration* techniques and extraction methods require significant resource, time, and cost. Dr David Holwell’s research methodologies \[ **R1**\- **R7**\] informed new exploration strategies and mining procedures in Greenland and Zambia, directly and indirectly contributing GVA GBP408,804,900 to four mining and exploration companies in the UK, Greenland, and Africa; and to local economies in Zambia through investment and c. 500 jobs \[ **E1\-E5**\]. 

 **Transforming business strategies worth GBP3,300,000 in Greenland**Holwell’s research methodologies \[ **R1\-R5**, **R7**\] changed exploration and mining strategies for two companies: Longland Resources \(Longland – now Conico\), Greenland. Holwell’s accurate geological predictive geological capability contributed to GBP3,300,000 in economic growth for both companies through leveraged investment, accelerated productivity lead\-time through strategic, surface\-level exploration, and company mergers \[ **E1**, **E2**\]. 

 The Mineral Systems Approach \(MSA\) methodology increased the value of the Ryberg exploration project, Greenland, by GBP1,750,000 following their purchase by ASX\-listed Conico \[ **E2**\]. Holwell’s MSA research in Greenland \(2008\-2014\) \[ **R1**\] identified indicators of mineral resources, and pinpointed likely targets within a vast region. Longland Founder/Director and now Conico CEO \(TAJ\) confirmed that Holwell’s research “ *highlighted significant potential for the discovery of a large nickel, copper and palladium deposit, which provided the basis for the decision… to set up the company* \[and\] *increase the licence area from 299km² to 3,889km²*” \[ **E1**\]. Furthermore, the discovery of gold reported in \[ **R2**\] is of particular interest to Conico, who are currently exploring the site \[ **E1**\]. 

 Holwell’s methodology \[ **R1**\] equipped Longland with the research evidence and strategic viability required to raise GBP1,580,000 investment \[ **E1**\] for exploration for both copper\-palladium, and gold deposits in summer 2020. Longland applied Holwell’s strategic, targeting methods \[ **R1**\] to apply electromagnetic geophysical surveys, in order to generate focused targets to reduce drilling time and costs \[ **E1**\]. 

 Howell’s “ *significant research contributions . . . resulted in* \[Longland’s\] *credibility to gain the interest of an acquirer*” – CEO Conico \[ **E1**\]. In October 2020, Australian ASX\-listed company, Conico, merged with Longland, which increased trading share prices by 11.5% by 4 November 2020 \[ **E2**\]. This acquisition was *“The most significant and tangible measure of the impact* \[from Holwell’s\] *research, with the result that Longland has increased its value by GBP1,750,000”* \[ **E1**\].

 \(c. GBP405,504,900 21 December 2020\) 

 **Resurrecting the Munali Nickel Mine**The Munali Nickel Mine in Southern Province, Zambia \(Munali\) was placed on care and maintenance in 2011 by then\-operator Albidon, in part due to “ *using the wrong geological model, hence the wrong mining method . . . leading to uneconomic operations*” \[ **E5**\]. The mine was taken over by Consolidated Nickel Mines \(CNM\), who approached Holwell \(2015\-present\) to help develop their geological and metallurgic understanding \[ **R2**\], leading to the Munali Mine Mineralisation Model \(MMMM\) \[ **E3**\]. Holwell’s MMMM and strategic protocols for understanding ore nature and continuity; and ore zone predictability \[ **R3**, **R4**\] improved Munali’s exploration indicators and their core logging, data gathering, mineralisation classification protocol \[ **E3**\]. Munali specifically used Howell’s magnetite research \[ **R7**\] as an exploration indicator to define their exploration drill targets, and to contribute to better understanding of an orebody’s predictable ‘shoots’ of nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group elements \[ **R3**, **R4**, **E3**\]. The former CNM CEO \(2013\-2020\) confirmed that, by applying strategies informed by Holwell's research \[ **R2**\- **R4**\], CNM were able to extend the viability of the mine to target Munali’s resources. He stated: *“By changing understanding in this way, CNM have been able to redesign the mining operations and brought the mine back into production in 2019”*, and exports of nickel and platinum concentrates began in May 2020. \[ **E4**\]. He further stated: *“With the assistance of Dr Holwell’s research, Munali was able to begin producing nickel and platinum concentrates in April 2020, producing an annual 3,600* \[tonnes\] *rising to 4,800 tonnes per annum of nickel in concentrate, valued, depending on nickel price,* \[at\] *USD40,000,000 – 60,000,000 per annum”* \(04\-2020, c. GBP37,546,750 12\-2020\) \[ **E4**, **E5**\]. 

 Munali’s Superintendent of Geological Services stated that Holwell’s research was *“of phenomenal importance to our understanding of the Geology of Munali Mine”* \[ **E3**\]. Munali is now able to give *“much needed assurance to investors”* by providing *“improved mining services, consistent feed to the processing plant* \[and\] *better understanding of the variability of the resource model”* \[ **E3**\]. *“Dr Holwell’s work* \[also potentially\] *increased the Life of Mine \(LOM\) of about 20 to 30 percent”* \[ **E3**\]. The former CNM CEO further stated: *“The increased capacity from Holwell’s research directly impacted on jobs at Munali Mine, which now employs more than 400 people with a 99% Zambian workforce”* \[ **E4**, **E5**\]. 

 **Transformed processing strategies for significant capital savings at Kitumba**Holwell’s research \[ **R6**\]—which he has applied since 2018 at The Kitumba Copper Project, Kitumba, Zambia, and in partnership with CMI and ZEISS—has changed CMI’s understanding of ore processing techniques, leading to significant economic benefits for CMI \[ **E4**\]. This research highlighted a critical misidentification in the mineralogy from previous work on the deposit. The results of the research enabled CMI to design and optimise their mineral processing strategy for the ores to minimise mining costs and maximise revenue from the copper resource. By confirming this feasibility, Holwell’s research reinforced CMI’s plans to develop the project, and changed CMI’s proposed processing technique. CMI’s CEO stated that Holwell’s research showed that *“the ore will respond much more favourably to the extraction technique \(acid leaching\) than previously thought. This change in practice equates to a reduction in the capital costs required to develop the project from c. USD450million to a more financeable USD220million”,* saving the company 51% in capital costs worth USD230M \(12\-2020\) \[ **E4**\]. 

 **Economic impact in a deprived region of Zambia** 

 CMI’s CEO stated: *“The increased capacity and production that Holwell’s research enabled at both Munali and Kitumba* \[ **R1**\- **R7**\] *has brought more than USD60million in investment into Zambia, with a further USD220million planned in 2021 from the UK and China”* \(12\-2020\) \[ **E4**\]. As of December 2020, CMI has brought both direct and indirect employment for c.500 people in the economically deprived Southern and Central provinces region of Zambia. Furthermore, CMI has worked with the Zambian and British governments to bring an additional USD100million \(12\-2020\) in investments into Zambian SMEs as part of its contribution to its sustainable development goals \[ **E4**\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study describes the impact from architectural research investigating historical settlement in the Sultanate of Oman \(Arabian Peninsula\). It advances the application of heritage theory and policy in Oman to arrest the on\-going loss of vernacular settlements. Successful collaborations with government bodies and local communities have pioneered implementation of heritage policies at 3 historic sites, saving these from dilapidation, and supporting heritage\-focused community cooperative development. The work has assisted ministries, museums, a financial institution, businesses and private citizens to realise sustainable heritage management goals, change heritage design practice and empower communities by raising awareness of the social and economic value of heritage sites. It has also built capacity in the cultural heritage sector amongst government employees, tourism operators and conservation professionals \(Oman, Middle East, Morocco, UK\).

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Research at this HEI was initially undertaken by Bandyopadhyay in 2000\-2008 at the University of Liverpool \(UoL\), and continued from 2015, again at UoL, by Bandyopadhyay and Quattrone for the ArCHIAM research centre \(Architecture and Cultural Heritage of India, Arabia and the Maghreb,  [www.archiam.co.uk](http://www.archiam.co.uk/)\). 

 Bandyopadhyay pioneered the systematic study of vernacular settlements and architectural heritage of Oman and the Gulf, which has underpinned subsequent impact work. This began in 2001\-2002 with a major exhibition disseminating research on Harat al\-Bilad settlement in Manah oasis \(approximately 100 panels; catalogue\) held in Oman and UAE, reexhibited in 2005\-2006. This detailed study developed and tested new methodological approaches to settlement documentation and analysis, identified the unique characteristics of central Omani religious, civic and domestic building types, and demonstrated the close relationship between tribal dynamics, social history and settlement morphology **\[3.1\]**. The Omani mosque type was further explored in 2003 within a wider peninsular Arabian geographical and temporal context to demonstrate its pre\-Islamic ‘South Arabian’ origin **\[3.2\]**. A study of the impact of tribal dynamics on settlement organisation and evolution \(2004\) demonstrated how large oasis settlements developed a more ‘cosmopolitan’ character that transcended tribal divisions present in smaller, isolated settlements. This research also examined the spatial implications of social exclusion and tribe\-specific craft traditions **\[3.3\]**. Analysis of settlement structure and evolution conducted in 2005 highlighted how topography, management of arable land and water, and social structure, shaped settlements in central Oman, resulting in differing settlement types and morphological processes **\[3.4\]**. ArCHIAM’s impact work has drawn on this understanding of complex settlement formation and inhabitation dynamics, achieved through a holistic methodology that combined documentation, and historical and ethnographic work, to devise culturally appropriate and sustainable management and development strategies. 

 From 2002 Bandyopadhyay’s research informed two significant heritage management reports for the Government of Oman and UNESCO, co\-authored by Bandyopadhyay in collaboration with international consultants \(Atkins; CES\). The work on Bahla World Heritage Site \(2002\-2005\) and Nizwa \(2004\-2005\) studied the urban morphology of large inland oasis sites and the role of water infrastructure. The Nizwa report also suggested an ‘adaptive reuse’ approach – arguing for a shift away from a conservation\-centred approach – based on sympathetic contemporary design introductions, to better align heritage assets with developmental aspirations. 

 In 2015 the ministries of Heritage and Culture, and Tourism commissioned ArCHIAM to develop three documentation and research reports employing a consistent methodology. Here, Bandyopadhyay and Quattrone’s research shed light on the nature of single\-tribe settlements and the impact of Indian Ocean trade on ports and inland oasis settlements **\[3.5\]**. The Gulf Architecture Project \(GAP, 2019\-2020\), funded by the Qatar National Library \(GBP737,000\), has helped expand this understanding across the Arabian/Persian Gulf region. Comparisons across the Gulf region have identified new building types and thrown light on variations of the religious and domestic typologies **\[3.6\]**. The research has continued to highlight the need to frame the questions surrounding preservation and tourism in the Middle East within a wider sustainable development discourse.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The main strand of impact is on <ins>shaping heritage policy implementation through planning and design interventions</ins> with complementary strands of impact on <ins>culture and creativity, practitioners and professional services</ins> and <ins>society</ins>. 

 Shaping heritage policy implementation through master planning: 

 Bandyopadhyay and Quattrone have developed ten heritage management masterplans and strategy documents covering all geo\-climatic regions of Oman, securing combined governmental investment of over GBP650,000. In 2016\-2017, following the delivery of Heritage Management Plans for Mirbat and Salalah **\[3.5\]** and Misfat **\[5.1\]**, ArCHIAM was commissioned to implement design interventions at 2 of these sites \(Salalah, Misfat\), significantly advancing the implementation of the 1980 Omani Royal Decree on the Protection of National Heritage. The management plans a\) produced implementable, fully economically costed masterplans, integrating development with conservation, and b\) shifted focus away from isolated monuments to settlements. Crucially, they helped the Misfat Cooperative – Al Misfat Al Ahlia – Bank Muscat and private stakeholders visualise and develop tangible partnerships in integrated tourism and economic development through design interventions. The National Heritage Council adopted the plans and disseminated these to stakeholder ministries \(in Arabic/English\), and directly to the public through the Heritage and Culture bookshop. 2000 bilingual booklets prepared by ArCHIAM were distributed to raise popular awareness of these initiatives, supported by national media coverage and state radio interviews. Following the Council’s recommendation, the Ministry of Tourism then invited ArCHIAM to develop a Heritage and Tourism Development Plan for the mountain oasis of Misfat al\-‘Abriyin **\[5.1\]**. The Plan “provided a well\-considered approach to showcase this heritage for tourists, and to facilitate appreciation through the development of tourism infrastructure and facilities for its stakeholders” and, once fully implemented, would “generate annual net gain in revenues of over GBP6,000,000” \(Undersecretary, Tourism\) **\[5.2.1\]**. The momentum around the Misfat masterplan has “assisted in driving an increase in the total number of guests stays to Ad\-Dakhiliyah governorate \[the administrative region\] of 43.3% from 127,000 in 2017 to 224,000 by the end of 2019, as well as increased visitation of 28.8% to the…key regional attractions” \(Undersecretary, Tourism\) **\[5.2.1\]**. Additionally, it has encouraged the Ministry of Tourism to earmark 2 more sites for development \(Birkat al\-Mawz; Izki\), which ArCHIAM had previously master\-planned, and the Office of the Minister of State and Governor of Dhofar to invite a tender for consultancy services for development and rehabilitation of two traditional quarters, one of which – Salalah al\-Wusta – was also master\-planned by ArCHIAM. This is expected to prompt “other ministries to take the initiative” for other heritage sites \(Expert, Tourism Services\) **\[5.2.2\]**. The Misfat masterplan encouraged the Oman government to select Harat al\-Bilad as a pilot project for heritage privatisation under its National Programme for Enhancing Economic Diversification, also known as Tanfeedh, “to develop with the local community and the other stakeholders” \(Director General, Tourism Development\) **\[5.2.2\]**. 

 ArCHIAM identified potential private partners in Misfat’s heritage development and mapped these against available governmental support **\[5.1\]**. To secure private funding for heritage management implementation \(a national first\), ArCHIAM worked closely with Al Misfat Al Ahlia and Bank Muscat. The momentum generated around Misfat in 2016\-2017 prompted Bank Muscat to fund the Phase\-1 implementation through its Corporate Social Responsibility Programme, increasing an initial commitment of GBP300,000 to GBP500,000 in recognition of the importance of this project’s contribution to national heritage and local development. The Misfat Phase\-1 implementation by ArCHIAM represented a pioneering public\-private initiative. This was the “first investment done by a bank in Oman” in heritage tourism development “to drive tourism to these heritage sites, encourage all other private sectors to look into these national projects as the impact is for the whole country” \(Head of Branding and Innovation, Bank Muscat\) **\[5.4.3\]**. The Ministry of Tourism is now “fully encouraging the approach adopted for developing Misfat al\-‘Abriyin” as a “role model” to communities and private stakeholders at other rural heritage sites \(Director General, Tourism Development\) **\[5.2.2\]**. 

 Changing professional practice through design implementation and training: 

 In 2016, Salalah masterplan led to the private commission to restore and reuse the 19<sup>th</sup>\-century Ghassani merchant family house \(Bait as\-Sail\), an excellent example of Salalah domestic architecture, as an interpretation centre. The intervention \(a\) introduced new approaches to local heritage design practice, showcasing both public\-private collaboration \(ministry, private owner\); \(b\) is the first adaptive reuse project in Oman, and \(c\) has helped to steer mainstream design and conservation practice in Oman towards sustainable development and sensitive contemporary design interventions in heritage sites. The Ghassani House conversion \( [view the Ghassani House brochure](https://issuu.com/archiam/docs/20190405_ghassani_house_brochure)\) has also changed design and procurement practice in the Omani private sector by creating a self\-sustaining private\-initiative\-led model for the interpretation centre. It stimulated over GBP400,000 private investment and employed a local SME contractor \(Mosha Trading Establishment\). 

 These approaches were scaled up to a settlement level when Bank Muscat awarded the Misfat Phase\-1 detailed design to ArCHIAM, who were supported by Muscat\-based consultant Architectural Wall Systems \(2017\-2018\). To introduce effective stakeholder participation in design for the first time in Oman, ArCHIAM and the Misfat Cooperative organised a two\-day community design workshop in Misfat \(July 2018; participation: 40; male/female: 65%/35%, age range: 6\-44 years; covered by press in Arabic and English\) **\[5.3.1\]**. These sessions recorded requirements and aspirations using models and montages that informed the eventual design and long\-term revenue generating strategies for a shop/info point, bakery and small restaurant. This public engagement initiative was publicised as a model for effective stakeholder participation in design nationwide and represented “a great opportunity for the local community to participate and give their opinions on how to safeguard, protect and develop their neighbourhood” \(91% would like to participate again\) **\[5.3.1\]**. The rehabilitated buildings featured in 2020 in a Bank Muscat\-commissioned video screened at the Misfat tourism development initiative completion ceremony in the presence of the Under\-Secretary of Heritage Affairs, the Bank’s CEO and the press **\[5.4.1:**  [**watch the video**](https://youtu.be/a2Q5aPI2Txc) **; 5.4.2\]**. “In 2020 three local Omani youth opened the Rogan Café in the restaurant building, responding to a national call for interest launched by Al Misfat Al Ahlia. The business employs 7 locals and has been generating a gross revenue of approximately GBP5,690 per month” **\[5.5.1\]**. 

 ArCHIAM’s pioneering adaptive reuse design was acknowledged as “different” and “added to \[local\] experience” \(Project Manager, Bank Muscat\) **\[5.4.3\]**. Its implementation  between January and December 2019 was supervised to completion by ArCHIAM/ AWS. It has enhanced the professional capacity of AWS, which had no previous heritage or adaptive reuse expertise. The practice “learnt…how to do design of heritage buildings, incorporating modern fusion into the projects”, and has since applied adaptive reuse in other private projects in Oman, supporting skills development in Omani architectural practice \(Senior Architect, AWS\) **\[5.4.3\]**. The contractor, Omani Services Establishment, which too had no previous adaptive reuse experience, employed on site 9 staff and personnel and 34 labourers and operators \(headcount: 43\), and learnt about community\-orientated implementation practice by involving, liaising and taking advice from the community, as well as fusing “modern and traditional concept \[of construction\]”, their “main achievement…from this project” \(Project Engineer, OSE\) **\[5.4.3; 5.4.4\]**. ‘Misfah Old House’, the only local B&B until recently, has seen a 25% increase in guest figures between 2016 and 2019 **\[5.5.2\]**. “On the back of the site development, 5 additional heritage style B&Bs have commenced operation in Misfat, with a further 2 under development” and “several additional activities have also emerged in the village including: a museum, a local honey and grocery store and a café selling local craft items” \(Undersecretary, Tourism\) **\[5.2.1\]**. 

 Global heritage conservation practice was enhanced through two further initiatives. The Getty Conservation Institute’s inaugural Middle Eastern conservation course included an ArCHIAM\-led week\-long training workshop at Harat al\-Bilad settlement, in Manah oasis, on urban conservation and reuse approaches \(November 2018; 22 professionals from 12 countries\). Bandyopadhyay was “involved in the visioning, development and delivery of the first course” at Harat al\-Bilad \(Head, Buildings and Sites, GCI\) **\[5.6.1\]**, “enhancing knowledge and shaping methodology for similar cultural sites” \(Participant, GCI course\) **\[5.6.2\]**. This marked a clear departure from established Getty practice of focusing entirely on buildings by moving the programme towards urban\-scale conservation and reuse training. Similarly, ArCHIAM’s role in the earthen architecture workshops in M’Hamid oasis, Morocco, led by Quattrone with the NGO Terrachidia \(2017 & 2019; 45 students/ professionals from 14 countries\), “was instrumental in teaching…heritage development approaches and principles, participatory design strategies and methods, thus effectively complementing Terrachidia’s hands\-on training in traditional earthen construction techniques” \(President, Terrachidia\) **\[5.6.3\]**. ArCHIAM’s work was globally disseminated \(2,256 views, 81 countries, 5 continents\) through an award\-winning documentary film, “very useful for architects and architecture students”, to “recommend to anyone about restoration and workshops” \(Coordinator, Istanbul International Architecture and Urban Films Festival\) **\[5.6.4:**  [**watch the film**](https://vimeo.com/338001258) **\]**. 

 Empowering communities through outreach and public engagement: 

 ArCHIAM helped structure the Misfat Cooperative \(Al Misfat Al Ahlia\), the first heritage cooperative constituency in Oman, earlier a small 5\-member company of young community members now formally approved with a 50\-plus household membership. Through the Misfat masterplan ArCHIAM successfully argued and developed guidelines for cooperative formation in consultation with the local community, and attended conflict resolution meetings organised by the local sheikh **\[5.1\]**. The Cooperative formation enabled the development of sites under complex ownership, making Phase\-1 implementation possible within the agreed timescale. Growing publicity surrounding Misfat masterplan attracted the Prince of Wales to visit Misfat \(5 November 2016\), which, along with an Al Jazeera documentary in Arabic \(2017\), enhanced the international visibility of the Cooperative. Today it advises the government on potential site development, as well as other rural communities about “how to convince people, how to change the culture, from where you start, what obstacles people have to take into consideration, how to tackle them in a professional way” \(Chairman, Al Misfat Al Ahlia\) **\[5.2.2\]**. 

 Museum content development for the National Museum on Omani traditional architecture and water management systems \( *aflaj*\) has raised awareness, enhanced perception and disseminated knowledge of the country’s history and heritage. ArCHIAM contributed to the Museum’s two prominent permanent galleries, ‘Civilisation in the Making Gallery’ and ‘ *Aflaj* Gallery’, through a curated feature wall of images and artefacts, digital visualisations and physical reconstructions, as well as touch screen interpretive material on the *aflaj* **\[5.7.1:**  [view the National Museum of Oman brochure](https://issuu.com/archiam/docs/brochures_national_museum_oman) **\]**. The feature wall was regarded as “impressive”and yet “straightforward” to comprehend by curators and guides, while the bilingual interactive touch\-screen display of the ‘ *Aflaj* Gallery’ “is a focal point” for the Museum’s French language guides and Visitor Services Specialists. The majority of the nearly 250, gender balanced, visitors surveyed \(72%\) were young students and professionals who felt inspired to undertake further research \(53%\) and attend talks and workshops \(32%\) following their visit to the galleries. For 77% of participants the touchscreen content as well as the knowledge presented on traditional architecture was very informative **\[5.7.2\]**. Funded by Research England \(UK\) and the National Museum, two workshops on Oman’s traditional architecture and *aflaj* irrigation system \(July 2019\) **\[5.7.3\]** engaged 40 schoolchildren, 7\-17 years old, through craft activities and quizzes that raised awareness and broadened knowledge of Oman’s history and cultural heritage amongst the younger generation. Approximately 80% of participants learnt about Omani traditional architecture for the first time at this workshop and expressed a desire to learn more about the subject by attending other workshops \(38%\), visiting traditional sites/ buildings \(26%\), watching documentaries/ visiting other exhibitions \(15% each\), and reading \(6%\). 90% of participants thought the workshop on the *aflaj* irrigation system substantially increased their knowledge on the subject **\[5.7.4\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 There is divergence in international regulatory policies on the safety of chemicals and the risks associated with their use or exposure. Lancaster University Researchers have adapted systematic review methods \(SRMs\) into chemical risk assessment protocols to improve chemical risk policy and reduce uncertainty. This was achieved through a consensus\-building process with scientists and stakeholders to foster adoption of these methods followed by the development of protocols, methods and standards. Our work has been used to improve the hazard protocol of the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) for bisphenol\-A, a widely\-used chemical substance \(1.25Mt per annum in the EU\), and the regulatory requirements for endocrine\-disrupting chemicals in the EU’s Biocidal Products Regulation \(528/2012\). Our SRM training programmes resulted in changes to the assessment of scientific evidence in the development of global evidence\-based health guidelines by the United Nations World Health & International Labour Organisations \(WHO/ILO\) responsible for establishing the global burden of disease from occupational environmental exposures. Our quality appraisal tools \(COSTER/CREST\), which ensure best practice for implementing SRMs in environmental health, have now been used in over 50 published reviews by over 1000 researchers worldwide and have shaped journal publishing practices.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There is controversy surrounding the chemical risk assessment \(CRA\) of glyphosate \(‘Roundup’\), bisphenol\-A \(BPA\) and other ‘everyday’ chemicals, with reputable scientific organisations disputing their health risks – even with access to the same evidence. Initial research into how risk assessment methods used by the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) for BPA compared to 'gold\-standard' methods utilised in medicine suggested systemic shortcomings in appraisal practices. These rely on narrative reviews that are inconsistent, in that: review objectives are not sufficiently clearly stated; methods for locating data are not consistently given; the criteria for selecting data for analysis are incompletely stated; how studies are evaluated for quality appears to be neither transparent nor consistent; and, the synthesis and presentation of results is unclear. These shortcomings could explain why such differing opinions on the health risks of BPA and other chemicals exist within the scientific community. 

 A policy document authored by Paul Whaley called  [<ins> *Systematic review and the future of evidence in chemicals policy*</ins>](http://policyfromscience.com/the-future-of-evidence-in-chemicals-policy/) \(2013\) provided the first technical analysis comparing European chemical risk assessment practices to the ‘gold\-standard’ systematic review methods \(SRMs\) used in medicine. Subsequently, in 2013, Paul joined Professor Crispin Halsall’s research group as a PhD student to investigate how the current shortcomings in CRA could be overcome by the adoption of a systematic review methodology. The review methodology approach ensured that the appraisal of evidence is conducted in a systematic way so as to reduce bias, recognise uncertainty and provide, where possible, unambiguous answers based on all of the evidence available. 

 In 2014/15, with the support of the Royal Society of Chemistry, we gathered leading experts from regulatory agencies, NGOs and industrial and academic sectors to develop a strategic framework for introducing systematic review practices to CRA \[3.1\]. This multi\-stakeholder exploration of the application of SRMs to CRA developed a consensus view on the potential benefits of adopting SRMs and provided strategic recommendations for promoting SRM uptake. This is relevant in the wider context of utilising SRM for the appraisal of scientific information by expert committees, who provide governmental or regulatory guidance for risk management policy in environmental health. 

 The adoption of SRMs in the appraisal of primary studies on endocrine \(hormone system\) disrupting chemicals \(EDCs\) resulted in a robust framework for assessing evidence from multiple streams of research \(e.g. *in\-vivo*, *in\-vitro*, epidemiology\) in the assignment of a substance as an EDC \[3.2\]. Research into SRMs and their application to the environmental sciences resulted in the development of a set of reporting standards \(Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses – ROSES\) that ensure that meta\-analyses and systematic reviews are reported consistently and to a very high level of detail \[3.3\]. In turn, these reporting standards ensure reliable synthesis of often disparate and growing bodies of evidence \(e.g. epidemiology vs. *in\-vitro* assay data\) required for evidence\-informed decision making. ROSES is designed to accommodate the diversity of methods applied to a wide\-variety of review subjects and reflects the heterogeneity and inter\-disciplinarity of topics such as the conservation and environmental management field. 

 The application of systematic evidence mapping as a technique for evaluating the ‘evidence landscape’ with regard to chemical exposure and toxicity has been demonstrated \[3.4\]. This method provides a step change in evidence\-gathering by providing a comprehensive, queryable summary of a large body of policy\-relevant research to aid chemical risk management. Systematic evidence maps \(SEMs\) provide a broad and comprehensive overview of an evidence base and facilitate the identification of trends which can be used to inform more efficient systematic reviews or more targeted primary research. Evidence mapping applied to CRA is a technique that draws into consideration all data which are relevant to chemicals policy and risk management, which leads to large, interconnected but heterogeneous databases. Locating, organising, and evaluating all relevant data is challenging when the quantity of that data is very large and growing exponentially. Therefore, to make full use of these data Halsall and his team have applied knowledge graphs which offer a flexible, schemaless, and scalable model for systematically mapping the toxicology and environmental health literature \[3.5\]. 

 Research on systematic review methods for application to CRA has centred on the development of reporting standards and codes of practice for conducting and reviewing systematic reviews in the chemical exposure, toxicology and environmental health fields. The idea of creating toolkits for authors and editors to appraise the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews in the environmental health and toxicology fields \(akin to those used in biomedical fields\) was developed. For example, we have developed a detailed code of practice for systematic reviews in toxicology and environmental health research, called ‘COSTER’ \[3.6\]. In essence, these codes set quality standards to ensure that systematic reviews in the field of chemical risk are of high quality and comparable to Cochrane reviews undertaken in the biomedical sciences.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The incorporation of systematic review methods in chemical risk assessment and the application of our SYRINA, COSTER and CREST tools \(see <ins>https://crest\-tools.site/</ins>\) has directly influenced risk assessment protocols and regulations within the EFSA and the European Commission. Whaley and Halsall have provided training to the WHO/ILO, which led to a change in their methodologies for assessing scientific evidence in the development of global evidence\-based health targets and guidelines. Additionally, our codes of practice for conducting and reviewing systematic reviews in environmental health and toxicology have changed publishing practices on SRMs in leading health science journals. These four areas of impact are detailed below. 

#  4.1. Changing chemical risk assessment methods at the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) 

 In 2016/17, EFSA sought to re\-evaluate, through public consultation, its hazard assessment protocol for BPA, a high production volume chemical with some 1.25Mt produced in Europe each year. Amongst other uses, BPA is used in food contact materials with BPA\-based epoxyphenolic resins used in protective linings for food and beverage cans as well as in polycarbonate food and liquid containers. EFSA reviewed scientific evidence from 2012 onwards to investigate whether the currently indicated tolerable daily human intake \(TDI\) of 4 µg/kg body weight/day was appropriate. During the consultation period, Whaley and Halsall provided written comments on the shortcomings of the initial assessment protocol, particularly with regards to the lack of SRMs. In 2017, we were invited as SRM experts to give a presentation at a BPA public meeting hosted by EFSA \[5.1\], attended by \~30 stakeholders from regulatory, food safety, NGO and industry sectors. An analysis using the COSTER/CREST framework \[3.6\] led to a significant and documented improvement in the EFSA's hazard assessment protocol \[5.2\]. The EFSA considered the inclusion of SRMs to provide a more transparent, less biased and overall more accurate risk assessment. This provided confidence in the current TDI of BPA but is considered temporary until a further evaluation is conducted using a protocol that now incorporates SRM. 

#  4.2. Impacting international regulatory requirements for identification of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals \(EDCs\) 

 Preventing public exposure to harmful EDCs is estimated to have a median annual cost saving of €163 billion<sup>1</sup> across the EU in terms of disease reduction and associated healthcare costs. On the basis of SYRINA \(an international SRM\-based framework for the identification of EDCs\) Whaley and Halsall coordinated scientific comments on the draft EDC criteria from the EU Commission. This took the form of letters to the EU Commissioner for Food & Heath Safety and in proposed redrafts of regulatory provisions during public consultation periods in 2015. The team also received direct feedback on the proposals from the Commissioner, who confirmed changes to specific criteria in the draft regulation \[5.3\]. 

 A quote from this letter states: “You suggest that best practices should be followed in evidence gathering, appraisal and integration. Under the proposed revised criteria, information must now be gathered and analysed using a weight\-of\-evidence approach and according to systematic review methods”. 

 The primary outcome was a change in how scientific evidence is assessed in evaluating whether a chemical should be classified as an endocrine disruptor under the Biocidal Products Regulation \(BPR; Regulation EU 528/2012\), which concerns market distribution and use of biocidal products. The proposed changes were adopted by the European Parliament and the EU Commission in 2017. This resulted in changes to several BPR provisions to specifically reference SRMs \[5.4\]. This has substantial implications for the approximately 40 countries that follow these EU and international regulations, in particular manufacturers producing chemicals suspected as EDCs \(e.g. BPA, phthalates, etc.\).

#  4.3. Influencing global health policy impact assessment methods at two UN agencies 

 In 2016, following a request from one of the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) systematic review teams, Whaley and Halsall provided training in SRMs based on SYRINA \[3.3\] and the COSTER \[3.6\] code of practice. The emphasis of the training was on the value of adopting a protocol \(that describes the conduct of a systematic review prior to the systematic review being undertaken\) and the uncertainty of the validity of current methods in light of COSTER \[5.5\]. This led to the WHO pre\-publishing and externally peer\-reviewing the systematic review protocols later that year.  Additional training was provided in 2017 at the International Labour Organization \(ILO\) in Geneva on bias in risk assessment methods to 40 global scientists leading the various review teams tasked with estimating the work\-related burden of disease and injury for different factors and/or exposures. This led to radical improvement in the proposed approaches and development of a new risk of bias tool for prevalence studies. Further training was provided in 2019 prior to the finalisation of the completed SRMs. 

 These training programmes resulted in changes to the assessment of scientific evidence in the development of global evidence\-based health targets and guidelines by the international UN agency responsible for global health. Specific WHO/ILO projects \(15 internationally\-relevant areas of concern\) exploring the use of SRMs to establish the global burden of disease from occupational environmental exposures are now provided in a Special Issue of *Environment International*, with an editorial overview provided by Whaley \[5.6\] who had a fundamental role in in designing the review methods and training the teams of authors involved \(see \[5.5\]\). 

 The Special Issue in turn led to improved understanding of the impact of environmental factors on global public health and, specifically, to occupationally\-exposed populations \(i.e. workers\) in developing countries with particularly high chemical exposure burdens. Following UN guidance should therefore result in improved health in those countries with exposed populations, with the WHO and ILO, along with our research team, ensuring compliance through audits. The Systematic review has now been adopted as the methodology with which to assess progress of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, most notably for Goal 8 \- to promote health and well\-being in the working environment \[5.7\]. 

#  4.4. Changing publishing practices at multiple leading environmental health journals 

 Lancaster research into appraisal tools \(e.g. COSTER \[3.6\] and systematic evidence mapping \[3.4, 3.5\]\) and hosting of an international workshop \[3.1\] on strategy for mainstreaming SRMs in CRA \(2014\) led to a request from *Environment International* to edit the first\-ever Special Issue on SRMs for Chemical Risk Assessment, coordinated by  [<ins>Whaley and Halsall</ins>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/environment-international/special-issue/10PVGN21HR3). 

 The success of the special issue \(relative citation ratio >2.5\) led to Whaley being appointed as the world’s first specialist SRM editor for *Environment International,* a leading environmental health journal \(2018\). As a result of this appointment, Whaley has been able to implement the COSTER/CREST framework \[3.6\] into the journal's workflow and has been invited to speak on more than ten occasions \(since 2018\) about SRM expectations and new processes, including informal trainings and consultations with submitting authors. In this role he has delivered workshops \(along with other editors\) to disseminate codes of practice and standards for systematic reviews. 

 These positions and the integration of SRMs into journal practice have changed how researchers assess existing evidence of health risks from chemical exposures, ensuring objective analysis and better reporting. To date \(2021\), there have been some 200 manuscripts submitted \(1500\-2000 submitting authors\) who have followed and benefitted from the COSTER \[3.6\] and CREST frameworks. Two scientific journals have provided consensus statements agreeing to the use of SRMs \[5.8a and b\]. ROSES \(see \[3.3\]\) has been endorsed by *Nature Climate Change*, *Environmental Evidence* and *Environment International*, providing, for the first time, an explicit minimum standard expected for a systematic review submitted to these journals \[5.9 a, b and c\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Behr’s research combines qualitative and quantitative work on live music ecologies – the intersection of musical and non\-musical actors in a location – with analyses of their national and international policy contexts, supporting and informing industry practice and policymaking to protect the provision of live music. The UK Live Music Census \(UKLMC\) – a world first as a national exercise – developed and deployed an open source methodology for evaluating the concerns of venues, musicians and audiences. Its findings impacted policymaking, contributing to legislative changes in devolved administrations and at Westminster, notably the introduction of the Agent of Change Principle and reviews of venue business rates. The ‘toolkit’ developed by the project has informed research nationally and internationally, with questions and methodological approaches taken up in Melbourne, Birmingham and Liverpool. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Behr’s research covers the music industries, cultural policy and, particularly, their interrelationship as it concerns the provision of live music. Central to this has been the UK Live Music Census – an AHRC funded project \(September 2016\-September 2018\) – that, itself, builds on a longstanding programme of live music sector research \(PUB5, PUB6\). The census investigators are also Directors of the Live Music Exchange \(a Knowledge Exchange body run between Newcastle, Glasgow and Turku Universities – Behr is the Newcastle Director\). In this capacity, they deployed relationships with key industry organisations \(UK Music, Musicians’ Union, Music Venue Trust\) to develop a methodology for producing a dataset that speaks to key sectoral concerns \(PUB1, PUB3\) – notably the pressure on music venues as the result of city development, alongside associated financial burdens, and their knock on effects for musicians \(PUB1, PUB3\). Having previously conceptualised local music on an ‘ecological’ model that accounts for non\-musical stakeholders, such as policymakers, and brought this to bear on examinations of the cultural value of live music in industrial, social and policy terms, the team \(Behr, Brennan, Cloonan\) trialled the ‘census’ approach in Edinburgh \(PUB6\) before conducting a national exercise – the first occasion on which this had been done across multiple cities. 

 The UK Live Music Census had multiple strands \(PUB1, PUB3\): 

 i\) A snapshot census of live music activity across a 24\-hour period in three key case\-study cities \(Glasgow, Newcastle and Oxford\) carried out by the core research team with student and local volunteers. 

 ii\) Online surveys \(nationwide as well as in the case\-study cities\) of musicians, venues, promoters and audience members. 

 iii\) Ancillary censuses carried out by teams associated with project partner UK Music’s Music Academic Partnership programme, in Leeds, Brighton and Southampton, and by others \(Liverpool\) data from which fed into the final census report. 

 This latter strand of the primary research was also integral to another part of the project – namely developing an open source methodology so that other cities, towns or institutions could conduct censuses of their own, resulting in a freely available live music census ‘toolkit’ \(PUB1, PUB3\). 

 Census findings were incorporated into a report – also freely available \- launched in 2018 at the Musicians’ Union and widely disseminated across policy and industry spheres \(PUB3\). Combining qualitative accounts of live music’s cultural value with quantitative work outlining the economic value of live music to the case study cities \(direct spend, GVA and FTE jobs supported\) \(PUB1, PUB3\) has advanced direct understandings of the scope of live music activity, the challenges facing it, and – through methodological innovations – the means by which policymakers and music practitioners of all stripes can account for the relationship between the broader values derived from live music. 

 This research programme is not limited to the centrepiece of the Live Music Census, but accompanied by sustained engagement and related analyses of live music as an ‘ecology’ \(a concept now in widespread use\). This cognate research flows from the same theoretical underpinning as the census. In 2018 Behr was academic lead on qualitative work funded by the National Productivity Investment Fund \(via Northern Bridge\) on the value of music tourism to the Scottish creative economy \(PUB2\), again covering the relationships of venues, musicians, local councils and national policy. Starting in 2020, the ecological model, and census methodology, are also central to an examination of the live music sector in Birmingham, and an assessment of the challenges it faces, and potential responses, arising from Brexit \(PUB4\) and, latterly, Covid\-19. Throughout this research, funded by the AHRC Policy and Evidence Centre and with Behr on the team, the nuance of cultural value and specificity of the census methodology cohere to provide findings directly applicable by venues, music organisations, and policymakers alike to the task of fostering live music provision, and have fed into digital mapping of Birmingham’s music ecology  – placing venues alongside other contextual and geographical data points – with, again, the methodology available as open source for broader adoption.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **a\)** **Shifting the national and international conversation about local music and music venues**: Extensive coverage of the census activities and findings in mainstream and industry facing media have highlighted the stressors on music venues and musicians pushing them closer to the centre of public – and both public and private sector – considerations of how to address them. The census is used as an authoritative source in media discussions across a range of live music industry and policy issues, such as ticketing, planning and business rates \(IMP\-REF1a, IMP\-REF1b\). This includes mainstream press \(IMP\-REF1a\), trade press \(IMP\-REF1b\) and industry reports \(IMP\-REF2\). In particular the research process itself, and then the findings, were used extensively to highlight the closure rate of venues, and key representative bodies \(UK Music, Music Venue Trust, Musicians’ Union\) have attested to its success \(IMP\-REF3, IMP\-REF4\) in helping them drive forward a national policy conversation on the subject. Latterly, from the release of the report to the present, media reports about music venues used census data as a standard indicator of the situation. The research fed into the launch of the DCMS Committee’s live music inquiry in 2018. As Lord Clement\-Jones \(Liberal Democrat spokesman for the digital economy, and previously for Creative Industries\) noted of the report, “it will really underpin and validate the case that so many of us are making inside and outside Parliament about the importance of live music and the closures and potential threats to grassroots music venues…\[and be\] hugely helpful in setting the scene for the Select Committee” \(IMP\-REF5\). The census, and Behr’s wider research, has also been used by the live music sector internationally to make the case for protecting venues, such as by Live DMA, a European network of live music associations representing over 3,000 live music venues, featuring in their reports \(IMP\-REF\-2a\) and recommendations for local authorities \(IMP\-REF\-2b\). 

 **b\) Effecting policy change to protect music venues**: The ‘Agent of Change’ principle is a legal mechanism whereby the person, business or organisation who produces change in an area by building new developments, or changing the use of existing buildings, becomes responsible for managing that change. Specifically, regarding music, it would make developers responsible for sound\-proofing and mitigation – not pre\-existing venues in the area. 

 Amongst the key recommendations of the census report \(PUB1 p.515; PUB3 p.61\) were that the UK government and devolved administrations look to implement the Agent of Change. The 2018 DCMS Committee at Westminster inquiry into ‘Live Music’ was partly driven by this programme of research. Several written submissions to the inquiry by leading music organisations cited census data in making their case, including submissions made by: UK Music, Music Venue Trust, Musicians’ Union, Incorporated Society of Musicians, Fan Fair Alliance, Ticket Swap \(IMP\-REF7, p.52\-54, with links therein to individual submissions\). The submission produced by Behr on behalf of the Live Music Exchange census research team was extensively cited, alongside the research itself, in the final 2019 DCMS Committee report \(IMP\-REF7, pp.6, 8, 24, 25, 26, 30\) which picked up on several recommendations made in the census report including that “robust and consistent implementation of the \[agent of change\] principle nationwide is crucial for it to be of meaningful benefit to live music venues” \(IMP\-REF7, p.27\). Agent of Change principle now sits within regulatory guidance across the UK following cross party agreement leading to its incorporation into the National Planning Policy Framework for England \(Para. 182\) in July 2019, Welsh Planning Policy \(section 4.3 committing Wales to the Agent of Change\) and being accepted as part of Scotland’s planning policy, in the Planning Act passed in December 2019. This requires local planning authorities to “take particular account of whether the development includes sufficient measures to mitigate, minimise or manage the effect of noise between the development and any existing cultural venues or facilities \(including in particular, but not limited to, live music venues\)” \(IMP\-REF10a, Planning Act, Section 14, Amendment 182\), following statements given and arguments made at bill stage based on evidence from the census \(IMP\-REF10b, Stage 1 Report, Planning Bill, Para.231, IMP\-REF10c, Local Government and Communities Committee, Columns 57\-8; IMP\-REFS 3 and 4; PUB1, PUB3\). 

 The DCMS Committee report \(IMP\-REF7, p.24\) also cited census data in its consideration of business rates on venues, echoing the recommendation that “The Government should immediately review the impact of recent business rates changes on the live music sector and introduce new, or extend existing, relief schemes \(IMP\-REF7 p.24, PUB3, p.59\). Census data was further provided on request to UK Music as part of its own activities in pressing for change on this matter, and cited as part of dialogue between \(then\) UK Music CEO, Labour’s Shadow Culture Minister and \(then\) Chancellor \( *Music Week*, 26 February 2019, IMP\-REF1b, IMP\-REF3\). As a consequence of this research and engagement activity, the Queen’s Speech of December 2019 included the stipulation that “\[t\]he overhaul of business rates will see the retail discount increased from one\-third to 50 per cent, extending that discount to cinemas and music venues for the first time” \(Prime Minister’s Office, *Queen’s Speech Briefing Notes*, p.111. IMP\-REF6\). Additionally, at Westminster, the DCMS Committee \(IMP\-REF7, PUB3, p.9\), echoed the census report’s language, and cited its data on broader provisions for ‘Music Cities’. 

 **c\) Developing the methodology for live music sector research**: Central to this programme of work was the development of a methodology that involved the co\-operation of key stakeholding organisations \(industry ‘buy\-in’\) which could be adopted by other organisations and localities. Census methods have already been used in cities beyond those in the original census project. The methodology was adopted in a related \(but distinct\) live music census of Liverpool and BOP Consulting’s report for Liverpool City Council on ‘Developing a Live Music Strategy’, acknowledged the research’s contribution and data \(IMP\-REF8a, BOP, p.2, p.51\). Likewise, the ‘census toolkit’ produced by the project informed the 2017 Live Music Census in Melbourne which acknowledges this contribution \(IMP\-REF9, p.3, p.26\). The census also formed the basis for an investigation of live music in Birmingham, with Behr as Co\-I, supported by the AHRC’s Policy and Evidence Centre \(Grant 3\). The digital mapping techniques deployed in the Birmingham research have also since been adopted \(alongside the concepts from the original census\) in Liverpool. The census research and resulting reports were significant contributors to the decision to form the Liverpool City Region Music Board in 2018 \(IMP\-REF8\). The strategy of that board, founded under the auspices of the Mayor’s office, has been significant shaped by the methodology deployed in the UK Live Music Census \(PUB3, IMP\-REF8\) and developed on the Birmingham project \(PUB4, IMP\-REF8\). 

 In terms of their findings, and the methodological strategy that led to them, the census work and related research using the live music ecology model and census methodology have been widely confirmed by policymakers and industry organisations across the spectrum of activity, from Lord Clement\-Jones \(IMP\-REF5\) to UK Music, City of Edinburgh Council \(PUB6\), individual venue operators \(IMP\-REF7\) and their representative bodies **\(**IMP\-REFS 3,4,7\) as making a significant contribution to changing both the tenor of the national conversation about live music provision, and the legislative framework that pertains to it.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Over 10,500 children in the UK with cerebral palsy are affected by dysarthria, a group of speech disorders that result from poor control of muscles of the chest, throat, face and mouth. Newcastle research investigated the benefits of intensive speech therapy, based on motor learning theory, which focused on breath control. Significant increases were found in children’s intelligibility, increasing their confidence and improving participation in communicative interactions. This research informed UK NICE guidelines and has already started to change practice to focus on effective therapies. In addition, the research has underpinned international undergraduate teaching and a widely\-used textbook. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Background</ins> 

 Dysarthria refers to a group of speech disorders resulting from abnormalities in the strength, speed, range, steadiness, tone or accuracy of movements required for control of the respiratory, phonatory and articulatory aspects of speech production**Footnote:**

 Motor Speech Disorders \- E\-Book: Substrates, Differential Diagnosis, and Management. Duffy, 2013, page 4. 
. It is commonly seen in children with cerebral palsy \(CP\): of the 30,000 young people in the UK with CP**Footnote:**

 [https://thepacecentre.org/information\-centre/stats\-facts/](https://thepacecentre.org/information-centre/stats-facts/) 
, around 35% \(10,500\) are affected by dysarthria arising from their motor disorders \(R4\). However, at the outset of research there was little evidence of the effectiveness of therapy for dysarthria and little guidance on therapies that were effective. 

 <ins>Newcastle research into breath control for improved intelligibility in children with dysarthria</ins> 

 Newcastle therefore investigated the effectiveness of therapy that focuses on improving breath control, since this is the foundation of speech. The research used a Speech Systems Approach underpinned by motor learning theory, where improvement in motor ability is due to repetition and experience. The therapy does not propose a cure or aim to change the underlying impairment: rather, it offers strategies to improve speech quality in children with dysarthria. The novelty of the research was to build on knowledge of a therapy designed for dysarthria acquired in adulthood to childhood dysarthria for the first time. 

 The initial paper \(R1\) studied the effect of intensive therapy to increase breath support in six young people with CP, and found improved intelligibility at the single word level. This success led to a later study \(R2\), which investigated a Systems Approach to controlling breath support, phonation \(vibration of the vocal folds to create voice\) and speech rate in 16 children aged 12\-18 years. Children received 18 sessions of individual therapy, which focussed on 1\) practising coordinating the onset of speech with the beginning of exhalation, 2\) maintaining breath support to produce a clear voice, and 3\) maintaining a steady rate whilst speaking to allow accurate articulation. The study found that intelligibility generally increased for most children, and that changes were maintained throughout the six\-week follow\-up. The increase in intelligibility was seen in both single words and across connected phrases, and for listeners both familiar and unfamiliar with each child’s speech. In addition, therapy was found to be acceptable to the children, and 14/16 rated therapy as “definitely helpful”. The next study \(R3\) investigated this therapy in 15 younger children aged 5\-11 years following the same protocol and motor learning basis. Overall, intelligibility increased for both single words and connected speech, and this improvement was maintained for 12 weeks without further therapy. In this group, intelligibility increased in all children for familiar listeners, and in some children for unfamiliar listeners. Parents were asked to rate the effectiveness, and all 12 who responded rated the therapy as effective. A further finding was that, after therapy, children participated in more communicative interactions and required less help to do so. 

 Despite the clear benefit of therapy for dysarthria, a survey of current practice \(R4\) found that the assessment and management of dysarthria associated with childhood CP varied widely across the UK. In response, Newcastle researchers worked with a range of bodies to include this new knowledge in textbooks, guidelines and teaching syllabuses: the impact of this is described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Newcastle research found a substantial benefit of breath control therapy on the intelligibility of young people with CP affected by dysarthria. Since breath control is fundamental to clear, intelligible speech, Newcastle recommended this as the first line of therapy before, for example, improving articulation. 

 <ins>Impact on NICE guidance</ins> 

 At the outset of research, there was little guidance on effective therapies. Newcastle research underpinned the chapter on improving speech intelligibility in the January 2017 full NICE guideline NG62 \(EV1\). For example, R2 and R3 are cited on pages 232\-5 as the only studies that investigated improvement of speech production and intelligibility for both single words and connected speech when rated by both familiar and unfamiliar listeners. The guideline also highlighted the finding of R3 that treatment improved children’s communicative participation in interactions at home and school. This evidence led to the following recommendation in the accompanying concise guideline on assessment and management \(EV2, page 20\): 

 1.9.6: “Offer interventions to improve speech intelligibility, for example targeting posture, breath control, voice production and rate of speech, to children and young people with cerebral palsy…” 

 <ins>Impact on practice</ins> 

 In 2019, a survey was distributed via the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists with the same question set as the initial survey \(R4, carried out in 2012\) to assess change in practice \(EV3\). Overall, the results suggest a reduction in provision of two types of therapy that Newcastle found to be ineffective or inappropriate \(R1\-3\). The first type is non\-speech oromotor interventions \(e.g. blowing, moving the tongue in different directions on command\); since neural control is specific, this therapy should not improve speech production. The second is articulation therapy, which can only be provided once breath control is sufficient to support speech. Specifically, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of therapists providing these interventions compared to 2012: from 70% to 43% for non\-speech oromotor interventions and from 87% to 77% for articulation interventions, indicating a reduction in the use of interventions with limited effectiveness. The proportion of therapists stating that they targeted the speech functions specified by NICE was over 90% in both 2012 and 2019, indicating that therapists now focus their limited time on more effective methods. 

 In addition, the therapy has been found to improve children’s confidence, allowing them to have more successful conversations, with a wider range of partners in more environments, thereby increasing their social participation \(EV4\). 

 <ins>Impact on Australian online guidance</ins> 

 In June 2016, the Australian Cerebral Palsy Alliance included R1\-3 as evidence on their webpage “Speech therapy for children with dysarthria” \(EV5\), which has around 250 hits/month, with the recommendation: 

 “Intensive dysarthria therapy appears to be effective for children with cerebral palsy… the studies concluded that these children’s speech was easier to understand after the therapy.” 

 <ins>Impact on textbook resources</ins> 

 Newcastle research \(R1\-3\) extensively informed the widely\-used 2016 textbook “Children’s Speech: An Evidence\-Based Approach to Assessment and Intervention” by McLeod and Baker. As of July 2020, this had Amazon sales rankings in the top 5% across Anatomy, Pre\-clinical Medicine and Family, and Lifestyle Paediatrics; and sales of over 800 in Europe and over 3,500 in the US \(EV6\). Citations of Newcastle work include: 

-  Page 379 “\[R2\] found that intensive intervention… using the systems approach… was associated with improvements in speech intelligibility for older children with cerebral palsy and dysarthria.” 

-  Page 514 “Across the evidence on a systems approach to intervention, procedures involving practice of a particular motor skill are usually based on principles of motor learning e.g.… \[R2, R3\]. 

-  Page 515: “\[R2\] reported that… intervention sessions 3 times per week for 6 weeks resulted in improvements in both word level and conversational speech intelligibility in children aged 12 to 18 years. A similar finding was reported for younger children aged 5 to 11 years \[R3\]. 

 <ins>Impact on undergraduate teaching</ins> 

 The research \(particularly R1\-4\) has informed national and international university speech therapy courses. For example, at Manchester Metropolitan University the research was crucial in developing their courses and has been adopted on publication into undergraduate teaching to 50 students per year since 2015 \(EV7\). The University of Strathclyde has included the research into undergraduate teaching since 2017, and R4 is compulsory reading for all 35 students as preparation for class\-based discussion \(EV8\). 

 Internationally, the University of Sydney confirmed \(EV9\) that undergraduate teaching has included R1\-4 as they have been published since 2014, including specific reference to the systems approach. The course is undertaken by around 90 students per year. At the University of Melbourne, R1\-4 were crucial to developing the course, which is undertaken by up to 90 students per year \(EV10\). The papers also informed a two\-year Masters of Speech Pathology degree. Finally, Radboud University Medical Center \(Netherlands\) confirmed that R1\-4 have been included into their undergraduate teaching to 50 students a year since 2013 \(EV11\). 

 <ins>In summary</ins>, Newcastle research found a substantial effect of breath control therapy on the intelligibility of children with CP who are affected by dysarthria. The results informed UK guidance, worldwide use in textbooks and international teaching practice.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights includes a clear commitment to freedom of expression. However, the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a Maltese investigative journalist, in October 2017 exposed the fragility of this commitment, highlighting the need for EU anti\-SLAPP \(Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation\) legislation. Research carried out by Dr Borg\-Barthet, examining in detail different approaches to anti\-SLAPP legislation, provided the essential evidence that was needed to underpin calls for change. His research formed the basis for the development of a common policy platform adopted by a cross\-party grouping of Members of the European Parliament and a coalition of NGOs, who used the research to advocate for change and to articulate the content of future legislation. As a result, the research has influenced debate within the EU about anti\-SLAPP regulation and underpinned an acceptance by the EU of the need for legislative reform.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Freedom of expression and the rule of law are foundational values of the European Union, and shared values of all democratic societies. Recent developments in several EU member states have demonstrated the fragility of these values, with threats to freedom of expression becoming commonplace throughout the Union. None was more dramatic than the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017. Caruana Galizia was a Maltese investigative journalist who had been investigating and exposing cross\-border financial crime involving several state actors. It transpired that the assassination was part of a broader attack on press freedoms through SLAPP \(Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation\), a form of legal harassment, which some powerful actors use to intimidate journalists and activists with a view to avoiding public scrutiny. The situation in Malta served to emphasise the challenges that the EU approach to SLAPP created. However, an appropriate evidence base to enable advocacy for new anti\-SLAPP regulations within the EU was lacking. Research carried out by Dr Borg\-Barthet at the University of Aberdeen positioned him as the obvious choice to support this advocacy process and provided the essential evidence to make a case for change. 

 In 2016, Borg\-Barthet explored the structure of private international law in Malta focusing on specific regulation of the treatment of companies, including systemic deficiencies in respect of those companies. Through an analysis of the somewhat limited literature and case law on Maltese private international law, supplemented by an analysis of legal practice as evidenced in assumptions in courts and practitioners' reasoning, the research found weaknesses in Maltese private international law of companies, due to a lack of sustained legislative and judicial attention \[1\]. Further research by Borg\-Barthet examined the extent to which claims can be brought against shareholders in transnational disputes, particularly as regards cross\-border torts and fundamental rights infringements, asking whether economically powerful actors were able to insulate themselves from liability in cross\-border disputes concerning civil wrongs. By analysing literature and case law Borg\-Barthet demonstrated that the law is structured in a manner which 

 practical implications of financial and psychological asymmetries in transnational litigation and proposes international legislative reform to facilitate the enforcement of obligations \[2\]. 

 This research established Borg\-Barthet as an expert in private international law, with specific knowledge about Malta, where he was also qualified to act as an advocate. Because of this, in the days following the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, several Maltese legal practitioners approached Borg\-Barthet to seek assistance with issues concerning the private international law of defamation. Borg\-Barthet noted that journalists were being threatened with frivolous but expensive transnational litigation. He was then able to identify, through spot\-checking of high\-profile newspaper reports, that a Maltese bank had been using the mere threat of transnational litigation to force the deletion of online reporting of Caruana Galizia’s investigative reporting. This research fed into the development of a Working Paper, ‘The Brussels Ia Regulation as an instrument for the Undermining of Press Freedoms and the Rule of Law: an Urgent Call for Reform’, which showed that the threat of transnational litigation was possible because EU law enables libel tourism by allowing claimants to choose the court in which to bring a claim. In the Working Paper, Borg\-Barthet also developed an alternative model for the allocation of jurisdiction which would prevent libel tourism \[3\]. 

 When a court hears a case with connections to more than one legal system, it must decide which laws should apply to the case. In the EU, this is usually determined through shared rules, which allow predictable outcomes. However, there is no such shared rule for defamation claims. The absence of a common rule on choice of law in defamation cases results in a lack of legal certainty and requires journalism on cross\-border matters to apply ‘the lowest common denominator of press freedoms’. Borg\-Barthet’s Working Paper demonstrated the need for amendment of the Rome II Regulation with a view to harmonising rules on choice of law in defamation to make the applicable law predictable to the parties and therefore relieving journalists and civil society activists of exposure to multiple legal systems. 

 Critically, Borg\-Barthet’s Working Paper also argued that, contrary to the view previously expressed by the European Commission, the EU did have the legal power to adopt legislation which would introduce safeguards against SLAPPs. The research identified the basis for the adoption of legislation in the law of the internal market. Borrowing particularly from anti\-SLAPP statutes in the United States, it proposes that EU law should require Member States’ courts to allow expeditious hearings of SLAPP cases, and to introduce cost\-shifting sanctions. It also proposes further protections against litigation brought or threatened in countries outside the EU \[3\]. 

 The form and content of a possible future directive was articulated more fully in a Model Directive drafted by Borg\-Barthet, in collaboration with Ravo and Kramer. The Model Directive proposes that courts should be empowered to dismiss frivolous cases and to require respondents in such cases to be compensated. It is also proposed that Member States should provide adequate legal and other assistance to mitigate the financial and psychological costs of litigation \[4\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Borg\-Barthet’s research has prompted the initiation of a process of legal reform related to SLAPP in the European Union to eliminate practices, which result in the suppression of investigative journalism and public interest activism. The research has influenced debate within the EU about anti\-SLAPP regulation, underpinning an acceptance by the EU of the need for legislative reform. It has provided an evidence base for NGOs, enabling them to articulate the content of future legislation. Through events and online publications, it has also raised public awareness of the impact of SLAPP legislation. 

 **Creating an evidence base to enable NGOs to advocate for anti\-SLAPP legislation** 

 Following Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder in Malta in 2017, a coalition of NGOs  – PEN International, Reporters Without Borders, European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, Article 19, and Committee to Protect Journalists – came together to explore the introduction of an anti\-SLAPP EU Directive. This coalition quickly sought advice from Borg\-Barthet, for which he drew directly on the research unpinning the original Working Paper. Borg\-Barthet captured this advice in a report, ‘ *Advice concerning the introduction of anti\-SLAPP legislation to protect freedom of expression in the European Union’* \[S1\], creating a resource that was shared with the NGOs, as well as journalists and legislators at various events. Borg\-Barthet was invited to present the report at the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom’s UNCOVERED conference \(200 attendees, including journalists, civil society representatives, MEPs and representatives of the EU Commission in Berlin in January 2019 \(https://www.ecpmf.eu/archive/events/uncovered\-conference.html\), \[S2a\] and then followed this up by organising a workshop in Aberdeen in February 2019 \(where participants also included representatives of EU institutions\) \[S2b\], and at an expert talk on Anti\-SLAPP solutions, held at the European Parliament in Brussels \[S2c\]. A further talk was attended by circa 100 representatives of EU institutions, and representatives of NGOs.  Following the event, David Casa MEP remarked that the research “ *provided us with concrete legal proposals that will now form the basis our work*” \[S2d\]. This has been confirmed by the President of the European parliament, Robert Metsola MEP “\[Borg Barthet’s research\] *has provided a much\-needed basis \[…\] for Members of the European parliament to articulate our wish to see a proposal for an EU\-wide Anti\-SLAPP Directive that could fall within the limits of EU competence*” \[S2e\]. 

 Borg\-Barthet’s work was also used to inform a common position adopted by a broader grouping of 26 NGOs in their advocacy work in the European Union, and was presented as the rationale behind a proposal presented to Pia Lindholm, Deputy Head for the Unit for Civil Justice within the Directorate\-General Justice and Consumers of the European Commission. In early 2020, Borg\-Barthet also presented his research to circa 100 representatives of EU institutions, scholars and civil society activists at the European SLAPP Symposium, organised by Greenpeace International \[S2f\]. 

 Borg\-Barthet’s advice has enabled not only the development of a better understanding of the technical aspects of reform which would assist in the attainment of the aims advocated by the NGOs but has also provided public servants and NGOs with an opportunity to engage with one another to better understand potential routes for acceptable reform. Testimony from Article 19’s Head of Europe and Central Asia demonstrates the vital role that Borg\-Barthet’s research has played. Not only has it ‘ *contributed to the rapid development of understanding of legal shortcomings which enable the suppression of freedom of expression in the EU*’, it has also 

 *enabled a coalition of NGOs to identify the legal issues which enabled Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation \(SLAPP\)… On the basis of his work, NGOs developed their policy positions on anti\- SLAPP legislation, and were better placed to understand the broader policy and legal context in which our advocacy work was to be conducted. The articulation of clear solutions and well\-researched justifications for legislative intervention has been a crucial element of NGO advocacy in this regard. The research which Dr Borg\-Barthet conducted empowered a coalition of NGOs better to articulate the legal basis for the adoption of EU legislation, as well as the content of future legislation* \[S2g\]. 

 **Influencing EU political debate and legislative reform** 

 In April 2018, a cross\-party group of Members of the European Parliament wrote to the European Commission to request reform of EU defamation law. The Commission’s response at this stage suggested that the Union lacked a specific competence to adopt new legislation, and that existing legislation struck a sound balance between relevant rights. By drawing directly on Borg\-Barthet’s research, this cross\-party group, supported by the coalition of NGOs, have since been able to convince the EU to alter its stance \[S3c\], so much so that, by October 2019, Vice\-President Designate Jourová had been persuaded of the necessity to introduce reforms, as evidenced in her confirmation hearings before the European Parliament \[S3a\-b\]. As the Article 19 testimony confirms, ‘ *Indeed, as a consequence of the work which we have conducted with Dr Borg\-Barthet’s assistance, the European Commission has now included the adoption of anti\- SLAPP measures in its European Democracy Action Plan*’ \[S2g\]. 

 This European Democracy Action Plan <ins>\(</ins><ins>https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities\-2019\-2024/new\-push\-european\-democracy/european\-democracy\-action\-plan\_en</ins><ins>\)</ins>, published in December 2020, draws directly on Borg\-Barthet’s research \[S4\]. To continue the work, Borg\-Barthet has been engaged as a legal expert on behalf of the NGO coalition \[P1; 4\] charged with drafting model legislation and providing legal advice at meetings with Vice\-President Jourová and Commissioner Reynders. Jourová has also indicated that the Commission will consider the most robust legislative and non\-legislative measures available, once the expert advisory group has completed its work. Borg\-Barthet’s role in this shift in EU priorities is captured by EU Representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists: 

 *His academic research provided the Commission with the legal basis to revise existing EU law... Together, we have been able to secure commitments from the European Commission to act with regards to a recast of the cornerstones of EU law, the Brussels Ia Regulation and the Rome II Regulation. This is no small feat and quite simply we could not have achieved this without Justin’s leadership, knowledge and assessment of EU and private international law* \[S5\]. 

 **Raising awareness in civil society about the impact of Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation Legislation** 

 In the phase immediately following the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, Borg\-Barthet used a personal Facebook page to publicise the hitherto undisclosed fact that accurate reporting of transnational interest was being deleted or redacted by every major media entity in Malta following threats of vexatious litigation. The revelations were shared widely through social media and resulted in four leading independent media entities informing their readers that they had been forced to alter online content due to the potential cost of defending a lawsuit outside of their own jurisdiction. As testimony from the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation affirms, 

 *Dr Borg Barthet’s research and publication on the subject of SLAPPs exposed the use of such covert action and its chilling effect on news media in Malta, enabling the affected media to publicly admit to having received threats of litigation, particularly from Ali Sadr and Pilatus Bank* \[S6\]. 

 The EU Representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists has stated that Borg\-Barthet’s work, initially used by the NGOs, has also raised awareness amongst civil society about SLAPP and its implications: 

 \[Borg\-Barthet’s\] *work in turn expanded to create a larger pan\-European civil society movement on SLAPPs, that has now mobilized not only press freedom groups, but environmental INGOs, trade unions, and lawyer networks to work together to expose and campaign against the problem. Through regular exchanges, it has been Justin who has been pivotal in providing INGOs with the arguments that expose the legal shortcomings that enable SLAPPs. His academic research … gave civil society the fuel to approach the Commission, and in turn again expose these flaws using substantive academic research as the basis for our arguments* \[S5\]. 

 The research has also been shared through the mainstream press, including explicit citations of Dr Borg\-Barthet’s work in the Guardian newspaper \(e.g. https://bit.ly/3tng1lR\) in the United Kingdom and multiple newspapers in Malta \(e.g. https://bit.ly/3qHCAQd\), as well as several reference to the resultant proposals on news sites such as EU Observer, Deutsche Welle, and EurActiv \[S7\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our research on the relationship between rhythmic awareness and reading development in children found that **sensitivity to the rhythmic components of language is related to reading skills and can be trained in both beginning readers and older struggling readers**. Our **novel findings were used to develop a new range of 408 books with an external publisher.** These books use rhythmic reading activities to increase children’s reading proficiency. The Rising Stars: Reading Planet scheme for Key Stage One uses rhythmic reading activities to embed the speech rhythm sensitivity we found to impact children's early reading ability. This is the **first literacy scheme to explicitly incorporate rhythmic training into its resources for teachers and parents**. It is estimated that over 750,000 copies have been sold, including over 150,000 copies internationally, and that over 12,000 children in the UK have engaged with the Reading Planet scheme. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 It is estimated that one in five children leave primary school unable to read at a standard that will ensure they are well placed to succeed in secondary school \(DfE, 2015\). Traditional reading curriculums focus on developing readers’ phonological awareness \(awareness of grapheme\-phoneme correspondences, commonly referred to as ‘letters and sounds’\), but do not incorporate the rhythmic components of language which accompany phonological awareness, such as linguistic stress, intonation and timing. Dr Harrison’s research has demonstrated \(a\) the importance of sensitivity to these rhythmic components of language for the development of reading skills, and \(b\) that rhythmic sensitivity can be successfully trained in both beginning readers and older struggling readers. 

 To address the absence of rhythmic tasks in reading curriculums, we undertook a review of existing rhythmic sensitivity assessments, and existing approaches to reading tuition **\(R01\)**. By examining existing tasks used to assess speech rhythm sensitivity, **we were able to specify areas where rhythmic tasks could be adapted for incorporation into early reading intervention**. 

 Dr Harrison then used this knowledge to develop a new speech rhythm\-based intervention, and trialled it against a traditional phonological awareness\-based intervention and a control group, with 73 4\-5 year olds **\(R02\) in the first randomised controlled trial of a rhythmic\-based reading intervention in beginning readers.** In a further study, Dr Harrison examined the effectiveness of this intervention in 49 struggling readers aged 7\-8 years **.** Results from both studies showed that **both beginning readers and older struggling readers who received our speech rhythm\-based intervention made significantly larger pre\-post\-test gains in word reading performance** compared to those who received either the traditional phonological awareness\-based intervention or the control. Importantly, to ensure that this intervention had a lasting effect, Dr Harrison also conducted post\-intervention trials and found that **those who received the new speech rhythm intervention continued to make the largest gains in word reading 3 months post\-intervention, demonstrating the longer\-term benefit of rhythmic\-based training.** 

 The relationship between rhythmic sensitivity and various elements of literacy was explored further in a sample of seventy 5\-7 year\-olds, with results suggesting that rhythmic awareness may indirectly affect reading outcomes **\(R03\)**. To understand the relationship between rhythmic sensitivity and reading in more depth, we explored the relationship between individual components of speech rhythm \(including stress, intonation, and timing\) and individual elements of reading \(including decoding, comprehension and fluency\) in a sample of 49 6\-7 year\-old children **\(R04\)**. We showed that all rhythmic elements were significantly correlated with all reading measures as expected. However, findings for individual elements of speech rhythm demonstrated novel findings showing that stress awareness made the biggest contribution to reading comprehension and fluency, whilst intonation appeared to make the biggest contribution to decoding. **Our findings demonstrate the importance of individual elements of speech rhythm sensitivity to reading in early readers, which has been used to influence the development of literacy scheme Rising Stars Reading Planet \(see section 4\).**

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of our research has been achieved through the following key activities: 

 **Rising Stars: Reading Planet** 

 Our research findings on the effectiveness of rhythmic training for enhancing reading skills in beginning readers **\(R01\)** gained the attention of external publisher, Rising Stars. We were approached to collaborate on the development of Reading Planet, the first literacy curriculum on the market to successfully incorporate rhythmic training for children alongside its books. We worked with Rising Stars to not only help develop the content of 408 children’s books based on our research, but also to develop material for the teacher’s guides, providing a\) guidance on the importance of developing children’s awareness of speech rhythm for reading and b\) related classroom activities based our research. 

 Reading Planet was launched to schools with 132 titles in October 2016 \( **S01; S02**\). Rising Stars have since published a further 276 titles, taking the scheme to a total of 408 books. Specific information on sales data and data from independent trials conducted by Rising Stars is not accessible to us, however, it is estimated that over 12,000 children in the UK have engaged with Reading Planet and the rhythm\-based activities developed by us, with additional interest in markets internationally \(monetary sales data are confidential and not accessible to us, though some indication is provided in supporting statement **S01**\). Over 750,000 copies of Rising Stars: Reading Planet books have been sold, including over 150,000 internationally. At least 20 schools who have utilised the scheme in the UK have provided positive feedback on the official Rising Stars website. The scheme also provides home learning resources to parents via its website \( **S02**\), including free reading advice \(e.g. helping children to master phonics\) and the opportunity to buy copies of the books provided in schools. 

 An independent evaluation of the impact of Reading Planet in 2017 yielded qualitative data from practitioners demonstrating the positive impact on the experience of learning to read for both children and their teachers. Unlike sales data, we were provided access to the qualitative feedback. Feedback from teachers describes the rhythmic activities within the books as “… *fun and engaging activities for the children and were used to help them learn about the importance of intonation, stress and timing. The activities match up with Letters and Sound phase 1 and seen as particularly useful for children struggling with phonics, helping them to become more aware of sounds before they start reading. Some schools are using speech rhythm activities as 1\-2\-1 interventions with lower achievers”* \( **S02**\) *.* 

 **Improving on teacher’s knowledge and use of rhythmic reading activities** 

 Despite research findings demonstrating the importance of rhythmic awareness for the development of literacy skills **\(R01\),** and the implementation of Rising Stars across primary schools in the UK and internationally, many teachers are still not aware of the benefits of including such activities in their teaching. 

 We provided a virtual CPD accredited workshop in July 2020 on rhythmic awareness and rhythmic training activities that can be used with primary school children. We assessed attendees’ knowledge of speech rhythm both before and after the workshop, and also measured the perceived utility of rhythmic activities for attendees’ teaching practice. The workshop was attended by a diverse range of 40 professionals including teachers, teaching assistants and assistant head teachers, from community, state and SEN schools \( **S03**\) **. Our workshop was both effective in increasing delegates’ knowledge of the importance of speech rhythm sensitivity, and increasing knowledge of rhythmic reading activities. Importantly, the activities were perceived by delegates as being suitable for use in their classrooms.** 

 Overall, 90% of the responding delegates reported a large increase in their knowledge of rhythmic reading activities after attending the workshop, that the activities were suitable for use in their classroom, and that they would be able to implement them with ease. Approximately 80% of responding delegates stated that they would be ‘very’ or ‘highly likely’ to include the activities in their teaching. Intention to share the content of the activities with colleagues was also high, with 90% of responding delegates indicating a likelihood to do so. 

 Comments from attendees also demonstrated how the workshop had improved their understanding of rhythmic reading and its implementation in their classrooms: *‘It has given me more knowledge to know what to use and resources I will need’, ‘I am going to link this \(activity\) into our phase 1 letters and sounds planning’.* 

 **Delegate feedback demonstrated both the suitability of rhythmic reading activities and their perceived ease of implementation into teaching practice across a diverse range of educational settings.** A follow\-up four months later, once teachers had had the opportunity to implement the new approach, demonstrated that teaching staff who engaged with the workshop have successfully embedded rhythmic activities into their teaching, and have observed benefits for their pupils. For example, one respondent stated that she had “ *created PowerPoint presentations outlining activities which focus on rhythm, music and speech*”, and has “ *integrated these into \[her\] teaching*”, as well as sharing materials, ideas and knowledge surrounding rhythmic awareness with her colleagues. Another explained how she had implemented rhythmic activities into her teaching to promote student engagement: “ *I have used a drum skin to tap out the rhythm of poems with my students with profound and multiple learning difficulties. They have become highly engaged with this activity over time and a couple of them are usually very difficult to engage.*” This follow\-up demonstrates that **attendance at our workshop had an impact on the teaching techniques used within the classroom.**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Since Brexit, Bartels’ research on the law of the World Trade Organization \(WTO\) and free trade agreements \(FTAs\) has propelled him to the forefront of policy debate in the UK. His research has had a direct impact on the UK Government’s approach to its independent membership of the WTO; he has advised the UK and Scottish governments and parliamentary committees on trade agreements; he has had a central role in the UK Government’s expert level training programme for over 500 trade negotiators; and his work has had a significant impact on public understanding of the UK’s negotiations, including an FTA with the EU.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Trade, which may be defined as the buying and selling of goods and services, principally by private actors, is regulated by governments by means of customs duties, taxes and other laws. International trade agreements limit the ability of governments to use such regulation to protect domestic industry, while allowing them to regulate for legitimate purposes, such as health, environmental protection, consumer protection, and national security. Since 1973, the UK’s negotiations of these agreements has been managed by the EU \(formerly EEC\). After Brexit, the UK has needed to establish itself as an independent actor in trade at the international level, including at the WTO, and by negotiating new trade agreements with other countries \(including the EU\). These issues are of the utmost significance to the UK, regularly being reported in the news on an almost daily basis. 

 Bartels is one of the leading trade law academics in the UK, with research publications over a period of many years centering on the law of the WTO and free trade agreements. The impact of his expertise has crystallised since the Brexit referendum in 2016. International law in general is a contested area in which doctrinal arguments based on legal scholarship play a key role in shaping practice, given the multiplicity of sources of law and the relative absence of authoritative interpretations; this is particularly the case with a rapidly emerging area like trade law; and so this is the context in which Bartels’ research has been pivotal. \[ **R1**\] was published on SSRN immediately following the 2016 Brexit referendum. At a time in which the legal position of the UK’s post\-Brexit position in the WTO was unclear this was the first scholarly treatment of the topic, and has been a reference point for subsequent writings on the topic. It focuses on the UK’s status as an independent WTO member, and argues that the UK’s WTO commitments are \(in part\) shared with the EU, and do not need to be renegotiated or ‘inherited’ from the EU post\-Brexit. 

 Post\-Brexit the UK is in the process of negotiating new free trade agreements, both with the EU and with other countries, and Bartels is one of the leading scholars on these issues. \[ **R2**\] \[ **R3**\] represent broader work on this topic, setting out the similarities and differences between different types of free trade agreement \(and customs union, a species of free trade agreement\), both in practice and as regulated by WTO law. \[ **R4**\] is a scholarly analysis \(and still the only one\) of an issue that was specialised but which became publicly prominent in the post\-Brexit debate; namely the conditions placed on ‘interim’ free trade agreements prior to their transformation into comprehensive free trade agreements. It considers the practice of such agreements over several decades, and critically comments on WTO members’ efforts to circumvent the WTO’s rules on these agreements. \[ **R5**\] \[ **R6**\] are concerned with other trade issues that are important to the UK. \[ **R5**\] analyses provisions in one recent free trade agreement \(the 2017 EU\-Canada ‘CETA’ FTA\) permitting, and to some extent requiring, the EU and Canada to regulate to protect human rights, as well as environmental and labour standards. CETA is not the first trade agreement to contain provisions along these lines, but is innovative in several respects, and this was the first article to analyse these aspects comprehensively. \[ **R6**\] is a comprehensive legal treatment of the EU’s trade policy, as expressed in trade agreements, since its birth in 1958. This is a topic that has been discussed by political scientists, but this was the first legal analysis of the issues, and goes into greater depth in interpreting the agreements by which the EU’s trade policy has been effected than the existing literature.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Based on his research, Bartels has had a significant impact on the UK’s Brexit trade negotiations; informing several hundred government officials and the wider public \(Bartels has over 9,000 Twitter followers and his Parliamentary appearances are often broadcast publicly\) around the technical and legal aspects of the new arrangements that will be required and analyzing their legal implications. This has led to greater understanding by policy makers and enhanced skills and capacity of the executive in a very specialized area at a crucial time for policy makers and others in official capacities. 

 <ins>Supporting p</ins><ins>arliamentary and government committees through o</ins><ins>fficial appointments and expert evidence</ins> 

 During late 2016 Bartels was invited to give evidence as part of an expert panel to the House of Commons International Trade Committee. As a result of his expertise and also ‘ *ability to communicate with \[committee members\] as lay people in an intelligible and accessible manner’.* Bartels was appointed as the first Specialist Adviser to the Committee, helping to produce the Committee’s first report, *UK Trade Options Beyond 2019*. \[ **E1**\] The report set the framework for a series of further reports, and early in the Brexit process, was a point of reference for those \(including MPs\) grappling with a set of new and complex issues. In this capacity Bartels ‘ *helped to plan and conduct the inquiry, which involved selecting themes and witnesses \[…33\], as well as advising on areas of questioning for nine oral evidence sessions.’* He provided regular face\-to\-face briefing to the committee so that they were ‘ *able to make the best use of the witnesses appearing’ and ‘assisted in digesting and analyzing 46 written evidence submissions*’. \[ **E1**\] At the end of the inquiry, Bartels assisted in ensuring that the report was ‘ *factually accurate in respect of any matters relating to trade law’*. According to the chair of the committee, ‘ *Dr Bartels worked closely with the Committee staff, both helping them to assist the Committee and significantly raising their level of understanding … in relation to trade law … and ‘providing assistance to staff on other committee teams who were dealing with aspects of Brexit that were relevant to trade law’.* \[ **E1**\] 

 Bartels was invited to give expert evidence to several parliamentary committees, including the UK House of Commons Committees on International Trade \(2018, 2019 and 2020\), Exiting the EU \(2018\), and Public Bills \(2018\); UK House of Lords Subcommittee on Financial Affairs \(2019\); UK Joint Committee on Human Rights \(2019\); and Scottish Parliament Committee on Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs \(2019\). His testimony was broadcast on the UK Parliament TV website, and gained a significant audience, and it was quoted in the Committee on Exiting the EU’s report *The future UK\-EU relationship* \[ **E2** pp. 14, 17 and 18\] and International Trade Committee’s report *UK\-US Trade Relations* \[ **E3** pp. 25 and 26\]. The chair of one of these committees said that ‘ *in his evidence he greatly clarified for us the trade\-law implications of possible arrangements to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland as a result of Brexit*’, and, in relation to another appearance as witness in July 2019, that he ‘ *considerably enhanced our understanding of the trade\-law issues around the possibility of a “no deal” Brexit occurring at the end of October 2019’*. ‘ *In conclusion, the Committee’s level of understanding and the quality of its output has undoubtedly been much enhanced by his involvement*’. \[ **E1**\] 

 On more than one occasion, Bartels’ testimony was the basis for questions to other subsequent witnesses in parliamentary committee inquiries, including then Minister for Exiting the EU, Mr David Davis \[ **E2** p. 14\]. His work \[ **R5**\] was cited in parliamentary proceedings \[ **E4** p. 21\]. 

 In 2019 Bartels was appointed to the UK Government Technical Advisory Group on alternative arrangements to the Northern Ireland ‘backstop’. This was an advisory committee chaired by a UK cabinet minister, and its meetings were also attended by other ministers, including at cabinet level. Bartels was the only generalist trade lawyer appointed to this group, and he contributed to finding a means of facilitating trade in goods across the border \[ **E5**\]. 

 Bartels also contributed to professional and industry bodies in order to provide expert, independent advice on the development and delivery of UK trade policy to government. Since 2019 he has participated in the Professional Business Services Expert Trade Advisory Group, organized by Deloitte, at which civil servants give regular briefings on Brexit preparations and receive input from the professional services industry. In this capacity Bartels authored a report on the UK’s ability to export legal services to the EU in a ‘no deal’ scenario. He was also a major contributor to policy notes produced by the Law Society \(on customs unions\) and the Financial Markets Law Committee on other aspects of government trade policy \[ **E6**\]. He also sits on the consultative group on Business and Professional Services \(Deloitte Trade Technical Group ‘MMWG’, an industry/government forum\). 

 ‘*Lorand Bartels’ research on WTO law and policy is the most frequently cited work that I have seen in internal working documents. This has made an important contribution to the development of policy across a number of Government Departments particularly as it concerns the development of WTO schedules of concessions and commitments’* \(statement from permanent civil servant, UK department for International Trade, May 2019\) \[ **E7**\]. 

 <ins>Use of expert analysis</ins> <ins>by UK government in</ins> <ins>trade</ins> <ins>negotiations</ins> 

 Expert analysis by Bartels has had a major impact on the formulation of UK Government policy on its position in the WTO in the immediate aftermath of Brexit. The current UK government’s policy on its WTO ‘schedules’ of trade concessions has followed the analysis presented in \[ **R4**\] extremely closely: *‘As the UK’s Ambassador to the WTO during this period, I can confirm that \[ **R4**\] was highly influential in shaping our policy response. I first came across the article on Twitter, and promptly circulated it to colleagues in the UK Mission in Geneva and Whitehall … It is fair to say that it shaped the policy for our transition in the WTO agreed by the Cabinet in October 2016, and remains our policy today’.* \[ **E8**\] 

  

 <ins>Training government officials</ins> 

 Since 2017 Bartels has been academic director of the Linklaters Trade Institute, established to train UK civil servants under contract with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s Diplomatic Academy, which has responsibility for training UK trade negotiators. Bartels has had oversight of content and together with Linklaters project managers and partners, delivery of training on all aspects of free trade agreements as well as negotiation skills for which he drew significantly on the material contained in \[ **R2\-R6**\]. Training was delivered in 13 separate four\-day modules from 2018\-2020 to over 500 civil servants, including FTA ‘chapter leads’ and chief negotiators \[ **E9**\]. The Dean of the FCO’s Trade Policy and Negotiations Faculty, has stated that: 

 *‘The impact of this expert programme, steered by Bartels, has been considerable. Over 500 civil servants are now prepared for frontline trade negotiations and have increased their awareness of the implications of policy choices. … \[H\]is session for Chief Negotiators on the use of law during a trade negotiation was taken up by the Chief Negotiators for the UK’s future trade negotiations with the EU, US and other countries.* 

 *Bartels’ extensive knowledge of trade policy and law has had a uniquely significant and positive impact on the way UK civil servants prepare for and conceive of trade policy and negotiations”* \[ **E9**\] *.* 

 Another civil servant states that *‘*\[the programme\] *has provided the platform for policy debate and formulation in the trade sphere and ensured that the required level of expertise was acquired rapidly and effectively. The material developed has been subsequently reused in different ways for different cohorts of policy makers. Lorand was central to this programme not only putting faculty together but developing materials and delivering much of the content. It was a major milestone in the establishment of the Department for International Trade.’* \[ **E7**\] 

 <ins>Increasing</ins> <ins>understanding and learning about UK trade relations</ins> 

 Bartels has been heavily engaged in disseminating his knowledge about and research on the UK’s trade relations in various fora. \[ **R4**\] is the only treatment of one of the foremost issues in both substantive and public debates around Brexit; namely, the legal nature of a ‘standstill’ FTA in the event of a hard Brexit. The paper was cited in a UK House of Commons Library Briefing, ‘No\-deal Brexit and WTO’, which had wide circulation, and was picked up for discussion by experts in a session of the UK House of Commons Committee on Exiting the EU at which he was not present \(Oral Evidence, *The progress of the UK’s negotiations on EU withdrawal*\). Building on this, and to illustrate the point practically, Bartels wrote a short ‘one\-page’ FTA to show what is required at a minimum by WTO law and to refute notions that ‘GATT 24’ \(as it has become known\) can be unilaterally invoked by the UK. This exercise had a dramatic impact on public debate, as shown by the attached graph, which shows the increasing number of citations of the phrases GATT 24 and Article 24 in thirty\-two UK media outlets, Hansard, Twitter, and Facebook over the period from Jan 2017 to Jun 2019. \[ **E10**\] 

 Since the Brexit referendum Bartels has provided expertise on trade law for journalists and commentators and is regularly quoted. In a piece entitled ‘Brexit and the issue of the WTO schedules’ \(28 February 2017\), the Financial Times correspondent and senior legal practitioner David Allen Green refers to the use of Bartels’ work \[principally **R1**\] by the UK Ambassador to the WTO as well as referring directly to Bartels’ work on the obligations of WTO members and necessity of WTO renegotiation following Brexit. He states that *‘As Cambridge trade law academic Dr Lorand Bartels explains \(in the fascinating comments under that post by Mr Braithwaite \[UK Ambassador\] – some of the best “below the line” comments I have seen on any post\): The other 163 WTO members do not have a veto of the UK’s scheduled commitments’.* \[ **E11**\] Green goes on to directly reference further work by Bartels in the article. 

 In a testimonial, Tony Connolly, the Brussels\-based Europe Editor for the Irish broadcaster RTE, states that *‘I've found Lorand's writings and social media contributions absolutely invaluable in providing an immediate, accessible, and understandable guide to whatever issue involving world trade which the Brexit machine has spun into the foreground. The role that Lorand plays has been vital in equipping journalists like me with knowledge that can refute, or support, a particular claim by one side or another’.* \[ **E12**\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Davey, Newport and Deribe at the Centre for Global Health Research \(CGHR\), Sussex, has provided important evidence – including detailed podoconiosis \(podo\) mapping – which has informed the Ethiopian and Rwandan Governments’ agendas on podo control, prevention and treatment. In partnership with the Ethiopian government and national NGOs, the Sussex team contributed to the implementation of podo care management initiatives in the most endemic areas, which resulted in the treatment of 70,000 podo patients \(approximately 5% of the national total\) and the training of over 500 health workers to identify and treat podo cases. The CGHR team has also led the first trial of a simple, inexpensive foot care package in reducing podo\-related acute inflammatory episodes in Ethiopia. This care package is now included in the WHO Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases \(NTDs\) training package for health workers, in the Rwanda NTD Master Plan 2019\-2024 and in the Ethiopia NTD Master Plan 2020\-2025. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Podoconiosis \(hereafter referred to as podo\) is a non\-infectious disease arising in barefoot individuals who are in long\-term contact with irritant red clay soil of volcanic origin. Major symptoms include swelling of the lower limb \(lymphoedema\) and acute painful attacks. The disease has major social and economic consequences through stigma and loss of productivity. Globally, there are around four million people with podo, mainly in tropical Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. As recently as 2010, the condition was not mentioned in the health policy of any of the 32 endemic countries, so no patient was able to receive treatment. Since 2005, staff from the Centre for Global Health Research \(CGHR\) at Sussex have been conducting wide\-ranging research to address some of the most urgent knowledge gaps, particularly around disease distribution, mental health consequences and management. This case study focuses on the research most immediately relevant to national and global elimination of podo. The research described is unique and distinctive; the team has contributed more than 95% of the articles on podo published in the past decade. 

 CGHR acts as the research hub for a unique global NGO advocacy for podo, Foot *work* \( [https://podo.org](https://podo.org/)\) for which Davey is the Executive Director. All the research referenced in Section 3 was supported by grants awarded to the Sussex team at the CGHR and delivered in partnership with academics and non\-academic collaborators based in the UK and overseas \(mainly Ethiopia and Rwanda\). Amongst the research stakeholders were representatives from the targeted countries’ Health Ministries, as well as NGOs active in the delivery of podo prevention and care programmes. 

###  **Understanding the distribution of podo** 

 Reliable and detailed data on the prevalence and distribution of podo globally are scarce. In many endemic countries, podo is confused with Lymphatic Filariasis \(LF\), another condition manifested by leg swelling but with a different cause \(parasites transmitted by mosquitos\). Estimating the number of people with podo according to geographical location is important for programme planners and health care providers, who plan, monitor and evaluate control and elimination efforts. This need was addressed by CGHR research through the production of a comprehensive mapping of podo distribution and prevalence \[ **R1; G1, G3**\]. Between June and September 2013, the team, in collaboration with the Ethiopia Federal Ministry of Health, generated the first nationwide integrated mapping of podo and LF in Ethiopia. By combining nationwide survey data with spatially referenced information on a range of environmental factors, the CGHR team identified human and environmental risk factors for podo and the endemic districts requiring prioritised intervention. In 2017, the research team used a geostatistical modelling approach on the nationwide mapping data \[ **R1; G1, G3**\] to estimate the number of podo cases \[ **R2; G1, G2**\]. The analysis gave an estimate of 1,537,963 podo cases in Ethiopia in 2015, with 99% of the cases being in remote parts of the three largest Regional States. This analysis also provided a framework for modelling the distribution of podo in other endemic countries, such as Rwanda. Nationwide mapping in Rwanda was conducted in 2017 supported by the Wellcome Trust\-funded ‘Global Atlas of Podoconiosis’ \[ **R3; G2**\]. In partnership with the Rwanda Biomedical Center \(the research arm of the Rwanda Ministry of Health\), Deribe and Davey demonstrated that podo was widespread in Rwanda with 80% of people with swelling of the lower limbs considered to be podo cases. 

###  **What are the mental health consequences of podoconiosis?** 

 In 2007, Deribe and Davey, in collaboration with Addis Ababa University, conducted a survey of knowledge, attitudes and practices in a community highly endemic for podo \[ **R4; G4**\]. It revealed that most community members, including health professionals \(HPs\), held negative, stigmatising attitudes towards social interactions with people affected by podo. This finding advocated for HPs’ training and the inclusion of educational components in community interventions for podo, aimed at dispelling misconceptions and stigma. In 2014, the team investigated depression prevalence in people suffering from podo, and the link between depression, disability and podo \[ **R5; G3**\]. This study demonstrated for the first time that podo sufferers were more likely to have depression, and that both depression and podo were independently associated with higher disability levels. 

###  **How should podo be treated in low\-resource settings?** 

 From 2014\-2017, Davey and Newport led a community\-based Randomised Controlled Trial \(RCT\) in northern Ethiopia, of a simple leg swelling \(lymphoedema\) treatment package funded by the Joint Global Health Trials Initiative \(MRC/WT/DFID\). The GoLBeT trial was the first trial to assess the effects of a lymphoedema management package on the most important clinical consequence of podo – lymphoedema acute attack. These attacks have devastating consequences in terms of pain, reduced productivity and potential progression to sepsis. The trial recruited 696 people with podo and showed that the package of foot hygiene, skin care, exercise, elevation, and use of socks and shoes reduced the incidence and duration of acute lymphoedema attacks \[ **R6; G5, G6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

###  **1. National Podoconiosis Prevention, Control and Elimination Policy: Ethiopia & Rwanda** 

 Information from studies conducted by staff at the CGHR has shaped policy in two countries in East Africa – Ethiopia and Rwanda. The route to impact is via Neglected Tropical Disease \(NTD\) Masterplans, which each endemic country is required to draw up to receive donations for Mass Drug Administration \(community\-wide preventive therapy\). Due to the co\-productive nature of the research conducted in each country, CGHR members provided research\-based evidence as part of the development and writing of the Masterplans, thus ensuring the rapid implementation of their research findings. 

###  **1.1 Ethiopia – evidence\-based national NTD Masterplan and healthcare programmes** 

 <ins>LF/Podo integrated mapping</ins>. In Ethiopia, evidence from CGHR research on podo informed the first edition of the country NTD Masterplan 2013\-2015 \(Deribe K. et al., *Parasit. Vectors*, 2012\), and the need for a nationwide mapping of the disease. At subsequent national NTD review meetings, Deribe and Davey presented CGHR findings on podo mapping \[ **R1**\] and estimation of the disease burden \[ **R2**\], which in turn informed the Ethiopia NTD Masterplan second edition 2015/16\-2019/20 \[ **S1**\]. As a result, the country met two milestones for podo elimination \[ **S1**\] by 2016: \(1\) completion of podo mapping and identification of endemic districts \[ **S2, R1**\], and \(2\) burden assessment in 58 \(16%\) of the districts \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Healthcare programmes</ins> <ins>–</ins> <ins>the Preventing Podo Project \(PPP\)</ins>. In 2014, Davey and colleagues were successful in securing a UK Big Lottery Fund grant for an implementation project coordinated by the Ethiopian National Podoconiosis Action Network \(NaPAN\) – an NGO bringing together researchers, policy makers, clinicians, and representatives of all groups offering care to patients with podo in Ethiopia. The PPP was a three\-year implementation project \(2014\-2017, GBP499,078 award \+ in\-kind/financial support, total GBP2,214,745\), aiming to extend small\-scale interventions of podo case management in the three regions of Ethiopia most affected by podo \[ **R1**\]. The successful project application was based on the CGHR research on the social \[ **R4**\] and mental health impact of podo \[ **R5**\]. The project contributed to the capacity building of 370 government health professionals and 182 health extension workers trained in podo morbidity management \[ **S2**\], with 67% expressing confidence in their ability to provide podo care \[ **S3**\]. As a result, 68,181 podo patients \(around 5% of the national total\) who would otherwise not have had access to treatment, were treated for podo and 115,653 individuals in podo endemic districts were educated on the disease through 1,150 community events, 55 district workshops, and 16 rounds of national radio campaigns \[ **S3**\]. A network of 18 patient\-led groups was also established for a more sustainable and accessible community\-based approach to podo \[ **S3**\]. Finally, the PPP was instrumental in catalysing \[text removed for publication\] \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Development of the LF/Podo Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention \(MMDP\) guidelines</ins>. Davey and Deribe contributed to the development of the LF/Podo MMDP guidelines \[ **S4**\] via NaPAN, using CGHR data on the mental health impact of podo \[ **R5**\]. These research findings enabled advocacy for psychological and socioeconomic support to complement medical and surgical care, which ensured full reintegration of patients into their communities \[ **S4**\]. These findings helped to define the patient counselling element of the care package, alongside medical care. As of February 2016, the guidelines were used to train a total of 300 health care workers and full coverage of the MMDP guidelines had been achieved in 87% of endemic districts, leading to the treatment of 153,250 people \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Lymphoedema Management Package</ins>. The GoLBeT trial provided the research\-based evidence for a simple treatment intervention on which to base national policy. It showed that a simple, inexpensive care package was effective in reducing the frequency and duration of acute lymphoedema attacks resulting in increased work productivity and quality of life \[ **R6**\]. In March 2019, the results of the trial were presented at workshops held to draft the third National Masterplan alongside CGHR research on podo burden assessment \[ **R2**\]. The GoLBeT care package is set to be incorporated in the next five\-year Ethiopian NTD Masterplan \(2020\-2025\) \[ **S5**\] and has been used by the \[text removed for publication\] \[ **S8**\]. 

###  **1.2 CGHR\-led podo research contribution to Rwanda NTD Strategic Plans** 

 In Rwanda, the CGHR research \[ **R3**\] has been described as “an impressive and substantial undertaking \[…\] reaching more than 1:10 Rwandans” and resulting in 282 community health workers being trained to identify podo cases \[ **S6**\]. The findings contributed to advocacy for podo interventions in the 2017\-2020 NTD Strategic Plan \[ **S7a**\] and CGHR staff advised on the podo elimination plan. In 2018, the study results were presented internally within the Rwanda Ministry of Health and underpinned the podo section of the 2019\-2024 NTD Strategic Plan, which sets the strategies to reduce the burden of the disease by 2024 \[ **S7b, S8**\]. Amongst these initiatives are the training of health professionals, establishment of 10 podo treatment centres in the most affected districts, and education of the population to the importance of foot hygiene and shoe\-wearing. Through Foot *work*, CGHR secured a three\-year \(2020\-2023\) implementation award funded by the IZUMI Foundation to support the government in this first step \[ **S8**\]. \[text removed for publication\]. The CGHR IZUMI award is critical for Rwanda’s government to implement the podo\-specific initiatives laid out in its NTD Strategic Plan, due to limited internal resources available to tackle this disease. 

###  **2. Global Advocacy on podo elimination** 

 CGHR research on podo prevalence and distribution mapping in Ethiopia and Rwanda has been pivotal for disease advocacy. In 2010, Davey was invited to give a presentation to the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases department about podo which, until then, was not one of the diseases considered by the department. As a result of this presentation, the WHO NTD department integrated podo under its “other neglected tropical conditions”. This recognition by the WHO catalysed significant changes to policy development within Ethiopia. Through this recognition, the country was able to include podo in their 2013\-2015 NTD Master Plan and mobilise essential resources \(such as the network of district\-level NTD\-leads\) to control the disease \[ **S9**\]. 

 In 2018, the WHO NTD department put together a pictorial training guide on neglected tropical diseases of the skin for district health workers, to support capacity building in the diagnosis and treatment of NTDs. Davey and colleagues’ research informed the podo section of the WHO training guide \[ **S10**\] which has since been converted into an interactive new mobile phone app \[ **S11**\]. Dr Jose Postigo, Medical Officer, Skin NTDs team, WHO Department of Control of NTD, at the announcement of the app’s launch in July 2020, explained its significance as follows: 

 “This software application will quickly allow health care workers and the public to get information about a specific disease – such as its clinical features, management and geographical distribution – and also provide a list of potential diagnosis.” \[ **S11**\] 

 In July 2020, Davey and colleagues, \[text removed for publication\], put together a series of user\-friendly slides on podo for district health workers training on the disease. This includes the latest GoLBeT care package \[ **S12**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Air pollution is globally the largest environmental cause of disease and premature deaths, and our research has **shaped the global policy debate around air quality, leading to changes in legislation, guidelines and practices**. In the UK, our research **has underpinned new regulations** on wood burning, the emission of ammonia from farming and the control of particulate emissions from road vehicles. Our work also underpins the latest **practitioner guidance** which notably has reduced pollutant exposure on the railway network. Overall, our impacts have led to improved air quality and consequent **impacts on the health and wellbeing of the population**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Air pollution is a major threat to public health and, according to WHO, leads to 4.5 million premature deaths worldwide annually, more than malaria and HIV\-AIDS combined. There exists a substantial body of research on air pollution from the University of Birmingham \(UoB\) which spans the last 20 years. The research extends from sources of pollution through atmospheric processes to personal exposure and effects upon health. Much of the work can be viewed as pioneering with individuals recognised for contributions to the discipline, which has subsequently impacted upon international policy and practice \(Harrison: OBE for services to environmental science, 2004; Royal Meteorological Society Fitzroy Prize, 2012; RSC Environment Prize, 2015; FRS, 2017\). 

 Although the research extends across a range of pollutants, our work on nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter is broad and has been particularly highly influential. The key contributions within the body of work are as follows: 

 **KF1**: We have provided better quantitative knowledge of the significant detrimental impact on human health of particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide through collaborative studies of the health effects of air pollutant exposures, including both population\-based epidemiology, human challenge studies and health burden estimation \[e.g. R1, R2\]. 

 **KF2**: Sources of particulate matter are numerous. Harrison has led UK research on non\-exhaust emissions from road traffic, generating the only currently available quantitative information on brake wear, tyre wear and road dust resuspension particles in the UK atmosphere, which demonstrated the important contribution of this source and which now exceeds exhaust emissions, to urban pollution \[R3\]. Importantly, low carbon heating options \(e.g. biomass burning\) can result in significant increases in airborne particulate matter. The first data on wood smoke concentrations in UK urban areas were generated by the group, which highlighted its significance as a growing urban problem \[R4\]. 

 **KF3**: Ammonia plays a major role in the formation of airborne PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The group were leaders in detailed field studies of the contribution of semi\-volatile ammonium salts to the concentrations of airborne PM<sub>2.5</sub>. As a result, numerical modelling studies, funded by and reported to DEFRA, have demonstrated the importance of ammonia emissions abatement in reducing PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in the UK atmosphere \[R5\]. 

 **KF4**: Air quality issues and consequent exposures can also be significant in enclosed environments such as railway stations. Cai collaborated in a study of nitrogen dioxide pollution at New Street station Birmingham, which was the first to highlight the significant ‘indoor’ air quality problem that existed due to a combination of poor ventilation and diesel trains, although particulate matter from electric trains can also play a significant role \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Air quality policy decisions have been informed by research evidence** 

 We have shaped UK and international policy debate around air quality, leading to changes in legislation, guidelines and practice. In the UK, our **research recommendations are frequently taken up by policy makers as a result of Harrison’s contribution as a member to key government advisory committees**. Specifically, Harrison has been a member of DEFRA’s Air Quality Expert Group \(AQEG\) since 2002 and a member of the Department of Health and Social Care Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants \(COMEAP\) since 1996 \(with a short break between 2003–2006\). He also chaired COMEAP’s Quantification Working Group on Nitrogen Dioxide \(2015–2018\). 

 Recent contributions to policy development and implementation can be seen in the 2019 government policy paper, UK Clean Air Strategy \[EV1\]. This includes a number of examples where policy change has derived directly from our research: 

1.  The development of **new standards for tyres and brakes to address toxic non\-exhaust particulate emissions**. The inclusion of this measure in the Clean Air Strategy directly followed an AQEG report \[EV2\]. This report drew heavily upon our research \[KF1 and KF2: 14 UoB citations in the report\] which **highlighted an issue of concern to parliamentarians and contributed a new analysis of existing issues**, in particular the fact that non\-exhaust sources of particles now exceed exhaust emissions of particles. 

1.  The introduction of **a ban on burning wet wood and domestic coal**, along with associated new powers for local authorities, was announced by DEFRA in February 2020, with staged implementation starting in February 2021. Concern about such emissions was an issue highlighted by AQEG \[EV3\]. This consideration drew directly on UoB measurements and associated data interpretation \[KF1 and KF2: four UoB citations in the report\] which established the large contribution of woodsmoke to PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations \(38%\) in the UK atmosphere. 

1.  The introduction of **new regulations to reduce ammonia emissions from farming**. The government has made legally binding commitments to reduce ammonia emissions from 2005 levels by 8% by 2020 and 16% by 2030 to reduce the negative impacts of ammonia emissions on human health and biodiversity in sensitive habitats. The associated AQEG report \[EV4\] used numerical modelling from UoB to explain how ammonia, emitted mainly by agriculture, contributes to the formation of airborne particles, which are deleterious to public health \[KF3\]. 

 The Head of Evidence for Air Quality and Industrial Emissions at DEFRA testified: 

 The reports of AQEG provide the evidence base for many of the actions set out in our Clean Air Strategy published in 2019. \[…\] Specific contributions from Professor Harrison, which have been very important, include the only UK measurements of brake and tyre wear particles in the UK atmosphere, the first measurements of wood smoke particles at urban and rural locations, and modelling of the production of secondary particles from ammonia emissions. His measurements and interpretation of ultrafine particle concentrations in the UK atmosphere are also a major component of the AQEG report on this topic, which informs the current policy position on this pollutant. \[EV5\] 

 UoB contributions to COMEAP have been similarly impactful. For example, the implementation of Clean Air Zones \(CAZ\) in UK cities represents **a decisive action in the management of the health risk of nitrogen dioxide**.  The policy was underpinned by evidence presented to government by COMEAP \[R2; EV6\]. Their report highlighted the health and mortality burden of nitrogen dioxide exposures and cited five University of Birmingham papers to evidence this harm \[KF1\]. The same COMEAP Working Group report also influenced **government policy on development planning**. Air quality damage costs prescribed by DEFRA for application in the evaluation of planning applications were modified in 2019 as a direct response to new coefficients recommended by COMEAP \[EV5 and EV6\]. The Head of Evidence for Air Quality and Industrial Emissions at DEFRA testified: 

 the work on nitrogen dioxide by the sub\-committee which \[Harrison\] chaired has strengthened the evidence position on this pollutant by providing updated 

 exposure response functions which has led to a revision of the damage functions used to evaluate development proposals and confirmed the need for the policy on Clean Air Zones. \[EV5\] 

 **Policy guideline targets for air quality have been influenced** 

 Policy change in the air quality space has long\-term implications. For example, the guideline values recommended in the 2005 WHO Air Quality Guidelines \[EV7\] **continue to make significant impact today, underpinning changes to air quality legislation across the world**. Our contribution to these 2005 guidelines includes the citation of five research papers and a chapter on particulate matter and sulphur dioxide published since 2000 \[KF1\]. A WHO regional advisor \(now retired\) testified: 

 Roy Harrison \[…\] contributed to both sets of guidelines and authored background material. \[…\] Research papers led by, or contributed to, by University of Birmingham authors related to the health effects of particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, PAH and benzene are included. The research cited in the Air Quality guidelines is key to underpinning the recommended guideline levels. \[…\] The 2005 recommendations have remained highly influential in shaping air quality policy in the European Union as well as many countries and cities across the world right to the present day. \[EV8\] 

 As such, this body of work still has significant impact in this REF period, where the influence of these guidelines and targets can clearly be identified in the latest policy documents. For example: 

1.  The Clean Air Strategy of 2019 states that “by implementing the policies in this strategy, we will reduce PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations across the UK, so that the number of people living in locations above the WHO Guideline level of 10 µg m\-3 is reduced by 50% by 2025.” \[EV1\]; 

1.  The London Environment Strategy, May 2018, states that “the Mayor has set new emission limits for full compliance with WHO for PM<sub>2.5</sub> to be achieved by 2030” \[EV9\]; 

1.  Article 1 of the 2016 revision of the National Emissions Ceilings Directive \- 2016/2284/EC states that, “\[the guidelines provide\] progress towards the \[European\] Union’s long\-term objective of achieving levels of air quality in line with the air quality guidelines published by the World Health Organisation” \[EV10\]. 

 **Practices have changed to improve air quality** 

 A range of **practitioners have used our research findings in conducting their work**. 

 A notable example is provided by our work at Birmingham New Street station \[KF4\], also featured in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme, which has seen Network Rail **change methods and practices** to improve air quality at Birmingham New Street station. Changes include a £1M upgrade to the ventilation system to replace CO<sub>2</sub> sensors with NO<sub>2</sub> sensors, enhance the fan system, reduce train idling times and introduced occupational health screening. Subsequently, the Office of Rail and Road has **updated the professional guidance** document for its inspectors regarding health risks associated with Diesel Engine Exhaust Emissions at railway stations and the action to take in securing compliance with air quality legislation \[EV11\]. 

 We have actively **translated our research findings into guidance for practitioners**. One example is our *First Steps in Urban Air Quality* publication which is now available in two languages.  It has underpinned a programme of investment from HS2 to improve air quality at its new interchange station on the outskirts of Birmingham and featured as **best practice** in the 2020 Public Health England review *Improving Access to Greenspace* and the 2019 *West Midlands Combined Authority regional air quality review and action plan*. We have also co\-authored European\-level best practice guides.  For example, *Measures to Improve Air Quality, AIRUSE \(2017\)* documents a state\-of\-the\-art compilation of measures to improve air quality in cities and is available in five languages. The website hosting the report has received an average of 4,000 visitors per month over the last three years. In another example, our body of work on airborne particulate matter \[KF2\], via the European Commission contributed to *European Guide on Air Pollution Source Apportionment with Receptor Models* which is a best practice guide to harmonise procedures across member states \[EV12\]. 

 Overall, our research has led to widespread **impacts on the health and wellbeing of the population, who have directly benefitted as a result of improved air quality**. The latest estimate by COMEAP of premature deaths in the UK arising from exposure to nitrogen dioxide and fine particles is between 28,000 and 36,000. Reductions in fine particle concentrations following directly from the proposals in the Clean Air Strategy 2019 will reduce that toll by up to 25%. Air quality is slowly improving across Europe, largely as a result of the tightening limits imposed by the National Emissions Ceiling Directive. Despite this, the EU estimates a total of 456,000 premature deaths attributable to air pollution across the EU\-28 in 2016.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Durham Chemistry’s development of a continuous synthesis of graphene nanoplatelets provided the intellectual property for the formation of the spin\-out Durham Graphene Science \(2010\) which was listed on FTSE AIM index in November 2013 as Applied Graphene Materials plc \(AGM\). The IPO valued the company at GBP26.2m. AGM has raised over GBP29.3m in venture capital funding, has 33 employees \(2020 payroll, GBP2.20m\) and has invested GBP2.85m in infrastructure to supply graphene for products developed with commercial partners including Halfords, SHD composites, Airbus Defence and Space, James Briggs Ltd, Century, \[redacted\], Infinite Composites, Alltimes Coatings, Blocksil and Applied Nano Surfaces.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Graphene is a single layer of graphite \(first isolated in 2004 using the Scotch tape method\) and is a continuous network of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms which gives rise to high carrier mobility, exceptional mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity. However, in the early years, commercialisation was limited by material availability and difficulty associated with product formulation. Solvent exfoliation of graphite \(Nature Nano. 2008, 3, 563\) could achieve graphene concentrations up to 0.01 mg ml<sup>\-1</sup> in solvents such as N\-methyl\-pyrrolidone. 

 To address this challenge KSC, supervising EPSRC\-funded PhD students Christopher Herron and Rebecca Edwards \(2008\-2015\), devised a simple chemical vapour deposition/pyrolysis approach to synthesize graphene which was continuous, high yielding \(gram scale\) and easy to scale up \[R1\]. This methodology used a flow approach, assembling graphene from the simple molecular precursors; it had the added advantage that the by\-products from the process were water\-soluble sodium salts that were easily removed. Similarly, the process avoided the use of graphite which is difficult to remove from graphene products \[R1,2\]. This process was further developed to use solid sodium carbonate and ethanol spray in place of sodium ethoxide solutions \[R2\] and metal templates \[R3\]. The use of metal templates allowed the size and morphology of the graphene nanoplatelets to be controlled and tailored. 

 Following the successful synthesis of synthetically useful quantities of graphene \[R1\-3\], Coleman has continued to innovate, elucidating the fundamental science and devising transformative preparative solutions for the generation of new graphene dispersions and nanocomposites suitable for applications \[R4\-6\]. This is evidenced through the EPSRC funded project ‘Engineering innovation in graphene nanocomposites for consumer product and packaging applications’ \(EP/K016784/1, GBP1,633,244\) a collaboration between Durham University \(DU\), University of Sheffield, Applied Graphene Materials, Procter and Gamble and Dyson. This project explored the use of graphene in polymer composites for use in consumer products. Durham has been looking at controlling the interfacial interaction between graphene and polymer and how this impacts formulation and melt processing \[R4\-6\]. This research and understanding have been developed further and used by AGM for the development of new dispersion and formulation technology for graphene nanoplatelets. 

 In recognition of the work on the continuous synthesis of graphene and the establishment of AGM, Coleman was awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry \(RSC\), Chemistry World Entrepreneur of the Year 2011 and the RSC Materials for Industry \- Derek Birchall Award 2017 for creativity and excellence in the application of materials chemistry in industry. Durham University Business and Innovation Services and Coleman were awarded the Times Higher Education Research and Innovation Award 2012 for the scale\-up and commercialisation of graphene fabrication technologies.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **The scalable route to graphene production \[R1\] was filed as patents by DU in 2009 and 2011 \[R2,3\]. To exploit this technology KSC formed the spinout company Durham Graphene Science \(DGS\) in 2010 \(Company number 07330136\) in collaboration with DU Business and Innovation Services who helped develop the business plan and patent strategy. Initial venture capital funding was secured from NorthStar Ventures \(North East Proof of Concept Fund, GBP100K, 2010\) and, subsequently, by IP Group as part of the North East Technology Fund \(GBP600k, 2011 and GBP700k 2012\). KSC was seconded from DU to the company for 2 days a week \(2011–2014\) as a Director and Chief Scientific Officer. DGS recruited an experienced management team and employees to establish a commercial\-scale production facility at the Wilton Centre in Redcar, capable of producing graphene following the protocol developed at Durham \[R1\-3\].** 

 DGS was renamed to Applied Graphene Materials plc \(AGM\) \[E1\] and launched on the FTSE AIM stock market under the stock ticker AGM \(IPO 20 November 2013\). The IPO \(through N\+1 Singers\) raised GBP11.0m in funding to allow expansion of infrastructure and increase staff to commercialise its graphene fabrication technology to the global market. This gave AGM an initial market capitalisation of GBP26.2m. Two additional fund raises of GBP8.5m \(December 2015\), GBP9.8m \(October 2017\) means AGM has raised over GBP29.3m \(November 2013\-2020\) in funding from the financial markets \(including institutional investors such as Eden Tree, Insight, Herald, Ruffer and Hargreaves Lansdown\) to develop its graphene technology \[E1\]. In September 2017 AGM completed the construction of their new production facility for the new grade of material A\-GNP 35 \(to complement the original A\-GNP10\), which was fully operational in February 2018. AGM \(2020\) employs 33 people \(80% listed as having a degree or higher\-level qualification\) based in Wilton, Redcar with a payroll of GBP2.20m \(GBP17.44m 2014–2020\). A full breakdown of funding, business engagements, income, salary costs, infrastructure investment and employees are provided in Table 1\[E1\].

 AGM’s customer base is seeing extensive growth in the coatings, composites, lubricants, adhesives and energy sectors in the short timeframe since production began \(all products containing AGM manufactured graphene use original DU research and IPR \[R1\-3\]\). The business is currently focused on building business engagement for long\-term partnerships and has 109 active business engagements \(FY2020\). Formulated products are supplied under the Genable® family, a fully characterised product platform specifically designed to a standard formulation to enable graphene technology to be delivered easily into existing manufacturing processes, enabling customers to consistently access the performance attributes of AGM’s A\-GNP graphene nanoplatelets \[E1\]. 

 
**Coatings and Adhesives:** In October 2019 Halfords \(FY2019, turnover GBP938m\) the UK's leading retailer of motoring, cycling and leisure products and services, with over 465 retail stores, launched a Graphene Primer containing an AGM graphene formulation \[E1\]. In the same period, James Briggs Ltd, JBL, \(part of the Tetrosyl Group, the largest supplier of car care, parts and accessories in the UK, FY2018, turnover GBP144m\) launched its Hycote graphene anti\-corrosion primer, developed in collaboration with AGM \[E2\]. \[redacted\]. Since July 2020, Kent Europe GmbH in Duisberg, Germany have been launched Genable® graphene\-based aerosol primers \[E1\]. Applied Nano Surfaces \(Sweden\) uses AGM formulations for its innovative graphene\-fortified low friction coating Tricolit®\-GO; \[redacted\] \[E3\]. 

 In July 2019 Alltimes Coatings Ltd, a leading specialist in the supply and application of protective coatings for buildings, launched \(Advanced Materials Show https://advancedmaterialsshow.com, with approximately 4,000 visitors\) the Advantage Graphene liquid coating roofing system \(with formulated AGM graphene\), with significantly enhanced anti\-corrosion performance and life expectancy, for industrial and commercial roofs \[E4\]. In July 2020 Blocksil Coatings launched a high\-performance graphene anti\-corrosion coating for industrial applications that has been approved by Avanti \(the leading provider of Ka\-band high\-throughput satellite capacity in Europe, Middle East and Africa\) for application on its large satellite communications dishes \[E1,E4\]. 

 The coatings area is complemented by high\-performance thermal paste adhesive materials. \[redacted\]. Since 2016 AGM has been working on the qualification of a thermal paste adhesive product TP300 and TP400 with Airbus Defence and Space. These novel epoxy adhesive systems exhibit high levels of thermal conductivity \(3 and 6W m\-1 K\-1 respectively\), combined with excellent mechanical, adhesive and outgassing performance \[E5\] 

 
**Composites:** In October 2016 Century Composites Ltd \(40 years of manufacturing fishing rods\) began sales of the Tornado Graphex sea rod range which uses carbon fibre with AGM graphene resin technology. AGM manufactured graphene now features in the new Century SGR \(Stealth Graphene Reinforced\) range. The graphene resin matrix used in the production of the carbon fibre prepreg carries the loadings generated on the rod and allows for the production of lighter rods with high strength and toughness. It is also used to minimises twist in the tip section which Century has called Generation 2 Anti\-Twist Technology \(Gen 2 AT\-T\) \[E6\]. 

 Infinite Composites \(October 2019\) has successfully incorporated AGM's graphene technology into two resin systems for cryogenic pressure vessels being tested for use in multiple NASA spaceflight missions, including materials on the International Space Station Experiments \(MISSE\), Artemis, and Lunar Gateway \[E7\]. 

 
In March 2017, SHD Composites Ltd launched a range of AGM graphene enhanced epoxy component prepreg resin system \(MTC9800 and now MTC9810\) for use in applications as varied as automotive components, sporting goods and artificial limbs. MTC9800 graphene\-enhanced product has been used in the award\-winning Sit\-Ski project run as a technology demonstrator by the High Value Manufacturing Catapult. In March 2018, AGM announced a collaboration with Magna \(largest automotive part manufacturer in North America with a turnover of GBP40.8bn, FY2018\) and SHD Composites on the W Motors Fenyr SuperSport tailgate using MTC9810 \[E8\]. The Fenyr Supersport and Sit Ski were launched at JEC 2018 in Paris with approximately 40,000 visitors from over 100 countries \[E8\]. 

 In May 2017 AGM launched their Structural Ink® technology platform to deposit AGM manufactured graphene resin on a structure in a targeted manner using 2D industrial inkjet printing. As part of the Nano Enhanced Aerospace Interiors \(NEAT\) project \(MAA243, GBP149k\), funded under the National Aerospace Technology Exploitation Programme \(NATEP\), AGM working with Composites Tooling Engineering Services \(CTES\), SHD Composites Ltd, Composites Evolution Ltd, Coventive Composites and GKN Aerospace \(a multinational automotive and aerospace company with over GBP9bn revenue\) demonstrated that graphene and Structural Ink® can enhance structural, fire, smoke and toxicity performance in composite parts for the aerospace industry. Several materials are currently undergoing field trials \[E1,9\]. 

 **Policy and Regulation:** AGM have been actively involved in determining European health and safety regulation. AGM is the lead partner and founding member of a REACH consortium that will enable graphene to be used in commercial products in the European Union \(EU\). REACH requires all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the EU in quantities of one tonne or more per year to register these substances with the European Chemicals Agency \(ECHA\). As part of this AGM \(with KSC\) and the consortium, have been identifying the risks associated with graphene manufacture, graphene dispersion and the use of graphene in commercial products \[E10\]. 

 In summary, AGM and all products arose from the new method for producing graphene on a large scale invented at DU \[R1,2,3\]. AGM graphene materials are used by third parties who supply products to end\-users and consequently detailed sales figures for some products are currently unavailable.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 For more than a decade, the Social Science Applied to Healthcare Improvement Research \(SAPPHIRE\) Group at the University of Leicester \(UoL\) has applied a range of theoretically informed, sociological research to understand how efforts improving healthcare quality and safety succeed or fail. This body of work has led to significant advances in the applicability and success of healthcare improvement programmes. By approaching such issues through a sociological lens, this research presents a deeper understanding of the people at the heart of the systems in which they work, and has therefore, led to the effective design and implementation of a wide range of improvement tools. These include initiatives such as ‘clinical communities’, the Berwick review and the influential TIDieR checklist. SAPPHIRE research underpins policy and guidance to drive culture and behaviour change in healthcare systems both in the UK and internationally for the benefit of healthcare staff and those they care for. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Sociological research undertaken by SAPPHIRE,in the Colleges of Life Sciences and Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities at UoL has addressed long\-standing issues relating to consistent provision of quality healthcare across the world. Successive programmes of research aimed at developing and implementing successful improvement approaches in healthcare have used social science and sociological theory, in combination with mixed methods, to focus on different levels of the healthcare system: from the micro\-interactions between individual patients and their care providers, to the organisation of healthcare institutions and systems as a whole. 

 This research has provided important insights into the challenges of: identifying the most appropriate points to intervene in order to maximise impact **\[R1\]**; the flurry of initiatives and targets that give rise to ‘priority thickets’ **\[R2\]**; the need for clear objectives and credible ‘theories of change’ in improvement work and intervention development **\[R3\]**; the problems with adopting improvement tools and approaches without consideration of their fit with local organisational cultures and histories **\[R1\]**; the challenges and unintended consequences in measurement and reporting for safety and quality **\[R4\]**; and contributions to the influential TIDieR checklist, a standardised method for reporting that enables the replicability of interventions **\[R5\]**. 

 SAPPHIRE’s research has been increasingly focused on the development and evaluation of approaches to improvement that are built on, or complemented by sociologically informed theoretical and empirical foundations. This research is having lasting impact on improvement practice, for example, shifting prescriber behaviour and promoting a focus on collectively desirable outcomes **\[R3\]**, and evaluations of measures to activate patient involvement in their own care **\[R6\]**. This entails instrumenting a shift towards the adoption of better understandings of practice, intervention and change: ‘in the round’, taking full account of social and cultural processes in local contexts so as to minimise the unintended consequences of seeking to deliver improvements in healthcare. 

 A notable example of the development of improvement methods is the ‘clinical community’ approach, a novel model for organising improvement that seeks to take the best from existing approaches while addressing their key shortcomings **\[R7\]**. Built originally on an analysis by SAPPHIRE of a novel approach attempted in the United States, and then developed through the formative evaluation of a programme of interventions sponsored by the Health Foundation in the United Kingdom **\[R7\]**, the ‘clinical community’ described through SAPPHIRE research seeks to combine the best of ‘bottom\-up’, network\-based approaches to improvement \(notably the enthusiasm, flexibility and breadth of expertise such interventions bring\) with attention to the need for leadership, good organisation, and the ability to direct and compel healthcare improvement **\[R8\]**. 

 Collectively, this body of research, funded by the leading healthcare funding bodies including the Department of Health **\[G1\]**, NHS England **\[G4\]** and The Health Foundation **\[G2, G3, G5\]** continues to make demonstrable impacts on healthcare systems globally.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The collaborative research programmes undertaken by UoL ensures: 

1.  research is written for \(and reaches\) practice audiences, for example, through close working with intermediary organisations such as the Health Foundation to produce clear and direct learning guides; 

1.  close working in partnership with key collaborators from clinical and managerial healthcare backgrounds to develop, evaluate and spread innovations; 

1.  participation and contribution to policy and practice dialogue **.** 

 **Safety culture and leadership** 

 The Group’s work has influenced government policy in the UK, in response to highly publicised failings in care quality provided to NHS patients, including the Mid\-Staffordshire Hospitals NHS Trust. The Francis Inquiry report in 2013 into Mid\-Staffordshire made far\-reaching, extensive recommendations, and the task of turning these into concrete action required significant government consideration. **Dixon\-Woods** was one of just 16 high\-profile experts \(including only five academics\) in the field of healthcare quality and safety who served on the National Advisory Group on the Safety of Patients in England who produced the influential Berwick Review, ‘A promise to learn – a commitment to act’ **\[E1a\]**. A review of the impact of this report evidenced that 64% of respondents \(NHS providers\) confirmed the Berwick Review had had a ‘high’ or ‘very high’ impact on their safety improvement agenda and directly attributed improvements, such as better reporting of incidents on the ward, to the review **\[E1b\]**. Moreover, the Group’s research was extensively referred to in the official government responses to the Francis inquiries and recommendations for safeguarding patient safety and improving quality **\[E2\].** Notably, the Department of Health’s report **\[E2\],** referring to **\[R2\]** above states: 

 “*One of the most important lessons of the Public Inquiry – reinforced by the ground\-breaking study of Culture and Behaviour in the English NHS by Mary Dixon\-Woods and others* **\[R2\]** *– is the close relationship between the wellbeing of staff and outcomes for patients. In part this is about ensuring that the right numbers of staff are in place – **and the Government has acted on that issue** – but it is also about ensuring that the right support, engagement and values are in place”* \( **\[E2\]**: Culture change in the NHS: Applying the lessons of the Francis Inquiries \(2015\). 

 **Clinical communities** 

 The ‘clinical community’ model draws together interdisciplinary experts from a range of professions \(clinicians, healthcare practitioners and managers\) to form ‘communities of practice’ to address specific issues **\[R7\]**. This was the centrepiece of an approach to improving quality and safety that achieved remarkable impact on key indicators of the quality of care at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System in the USA, resulting in six national awards **\[E3\]**. The ‘clinical communities’ approach has since been adopted by other healthcare systems such as NHS Quest, an alliance of NHS provider organisations that seek to be at the forefront of improving quality and safety. NHS Quest provides facilitation and support to ‘clinical communities’ to tackle specific problems, such as improving theatre safety and medicine safety \[ **E4a\]**. The Reducing Falls Clinical Community, supported by NHS Quest, resulted in a sustained reduction in ‘patient falls with harm’ of more than 50% by 2016 **\[E4b\]**. 

 **Nationally – Driving NHS improvement programmes** 

 SAPPHIRE research findings, highlighting the importance of long\-term culture change in embedding improvements, rather than one\-off initiatives, has been widely influential and has underpinned several NHS improvement programmes. In 2016, **\[R2\]** was cited in ‘Better Births: Improving Outcomes of Maternity Services in England’ as identifying cultures of high quality and compassionate care **\[E5\]**. The same research contributed to the NHS\-wide Culture and Leadership Programme Toolkit 2016 **\[E6\]** under both the ‘vision and values’ and the ‘goals and performance’ metrics. Research from **\[R8\]** and **\[R2\]** guided Condition 1 and Condition 3 in ‘Developing People – Improving Care’, a national framework for action on improvement and leadership development in NHS\-funded services launched in 2016 **\[E7\]**. 

 **Internationally – underpinning good practice** 

 Health improvement guidance and policy across a range of topics have been influenced by SAPPHIRE’s research. The World Health Organisation \(WHO\) Patient Safety Toolkit \(2015\) **\[E8\]**, aimed at ministries of health across the globe, recommends **\[R8\]** as a resource to help improve the quality of safety programmes. The call to action ‘Delivering quality health services: A global imperative for universal health coverage’ jointly published by WHO, the Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development and the World Bank in 2018, also cites **\[R8\]** in the chapter on ‘Understanding Levers to Improve Quality’ **\[E9\]**. The WHO practical toolkit on ‘Antimicrobial Stewardship in Programmes in Healthcare Facilities in Low and Middle\-Income Countries’ **\[E10\]** aims to support the uptake of interventions to drive behaviour change to address antimicrobial resistance. Intrinsic factors and behaviours that may prevent success of such interventions identified in **\[R3\]** are highlighted in the toolkit as important to consider. 

 The TIDieR checklist **\[R5\]** was developed to facilitate the sharing of good practice and successful interventions by standardising and improving the quality of reporting across healthcare. Reports that use the TIDieR checklist provide high\-quality information upon which others can replicate research findings or practice interventions/clinical trials. Influential advocates of the TIDieR checklist include organisations such as the Ottawa Panel **\[E11a\]** \(producing evidence\-based clinical guidelines\), the Equator Network **\[E11b\]** \(an umbrella organisation that brings together researchers, medical journal editors, peer reviewers, developers of reporting guidelines, research funding bodies and other collaborators\- UK, France, Canada, Australasia\) and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology \[ **E11c**\]. WHO includes the checklist in their recommendations for non\-clinical interventions to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections **\[E11d\]**. In the UK, Cochrane Reviews recommend their authors use TIDieR to ensure a detailed description of interventions of interest in their protocols and reviews **\[E11c\]**. 

 Taken together, SAPPHIRE’s sociological approach to culture and behaviour across healthcare systems worldwide has led to widespread policy change, practice guidance and tools that have driven a transformation in quality and safety improvement methods.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Unit’s research examining the characteristics of women’s sport and the relationship between menstruation and player performance has influenced the preparation and improved the performance of an elite women’s rugby team. Since the coaching staff incorporated the research findings into training, the team has risen from last \(10<sup>th</sup>\) to 6<sup>th</sup> in the Premier 15s league and the players are fitter and better prepared. Since 2020 the research supports the training session programming of the USA national women’s rugby team. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As female sport grows and develops, greater knowledge of the physical determinants of players and the implications of these on performance is of increasing importance. Research on the subject undertaken at the University of Sunderland incorporates three related topics. 

1.  **Gender differences in sport** 

 The research team at the University of Sunderland has investigated the influence of gender on sport, extending the modes examined to female eligibility in athletics **\[R1\]**, mixed\-sex football **\[R2\]** and tennis **\[R3\]**. The work conceptualises the rationale for sex\-based differences in sport through philosophical discourse, highlighting inconsistencies in governing\-body approaches and suggesting unfairness in the treatment of female athletes, evidenced by differences in playing standards, regulations and prize monies. The research suggests that governing bodies should consider removing disparities between male and female sports and competitions. The work provided an umbrella of evidence that supported the need for specific female\-based sport research that parts \(b\) and \(c\) went on to address. 

 **b\) Match characteristics** 

 Bradley’s research identified improved scrum outcomes in the Six Nations as a consequence of World Rugby rule changes **\[R4\]** and described match characteristics and player workloads in the Tyrrell’s Premier15s women’s league using 10 Hz Global Positioning System \(GPS\) and accelerometer technology. This provided objective data on match performance parameters including total and relative distances at threshold speed zones, player loads and work:rest ratios **\[R5\]**.  Positional differences exist in these parameters and these are not the same as those previously presented in the male game, which are usually applied to the women’s game for the purpose of deriving training programmes. Such sex\- and position\-specific data should be considered when designing conditioning programmes in female rugby union, developing fitness tests and benchmarking physical performances during competitive games. 

 **c\) Menstrual cycle** 

 Complex relationships exist between the menstrual cycle \(and associated hormonal fluctuations\) and various aspect/markers of health, wellbeing and sporting performance.  Previously, research has focused on amenorrhea \(recently classified as Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport\), usually in athletic populations. However, this affects a much wider sphere of female sports. Working alongside Scottish RFU, qualitative research into female rugby players’ experiences of the impact of the menstrual cycle on training and performance was conducted through semi\-structured interviews and thematic analysis **\[R6\]**. This demonstrated that negative symptoms were more significant than those experienced by the general population. Players indicated that the physical and psychological symptoms include increased worry and heightened emotional state, physical pain and tiredness/lack of energy. This rugby\-specific knowledge points to the need for increased player support during the menstrual cycle, through the development of training scheduling and match selection.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 The Unit’s work on gender differences in elite sports, and particularly on women’s rugby, has enhanced the performance sustainability of the Darlington Mowden Park \(DMP\) Sharks, an elite rugby team that competes in the Premier 15s, the top tier of the women’s English rugby union league. The team includes former England captain Katy Daley\-McLean MBE, six other England internationals and an Ireland international, and is coached by former Samoan international Mike Umaga. 

 Since 2016 Bradley has been the Sharks’ sports scientist and his contributions to the team’s success have been underpinned by the body of research undertaken by Bradley and other researchers in the Unit. This close relationship has benefited the team through Bradley’s dissemination of the research to team management and the application of his findings to training and match strategies. The team’s participation in the research itself has also given players and management staff access to specialist equipment that they would not otherwise have had **\[S1\]**. 

 **Improved training and performance** 

 Prior to the Unit’s research, data on the women’s game was scarce. When the research began, only two published articles and data existed on female 15\-a\-side rugby, none relating to the English leagues. This obliged coaches to apply data derived from the men’s game in designing women’s training programmes, with it the danger of increasing women’s work rate. Work rate is a metric in rugby union that relates to the intensity of play relative to rest, and training intensities are often based on how hard the players need to work in a match. If this is based on male data, it leads to overtraining. 

 Sunderland’s research enabled the DMP Sharks to tailor training to the characteristics of the women’s game, which has mitigated risk \(through closer monitoring of players health to prevent overtraining and injury\) and improved performance. The team’s Head Coach says that the Unit’s research “ *has been invaluable to us as a coaching team and has had a significant impact on how we prepare the team to perform on a match day*.” Two key changes to training regimens have been implemented as a direct result. First, training has been tailored to improve players’ high intensity running. This has improved repeatability of high\-speed movements, which has increased the number of high\-speed movements in\-match to a mean of 19 efforts per play and a mean distance of 496m **\[R5\]**. This is an important outcome since the number of high\-speed movements predicts whether a team will win or lose a match. Second, the team now focuses on reducing player’s drop\-off in work rate to ensure that players can maintain performance levels throughout the full 80 minutes of the game. The Head Coach confirms that these improvements have resulted in stronger and more sustainable performances **\[S1\]**. Team performances continually improved over the course of the time the research was conducted. In the 2016/17 season, the team won a single game and finished last in the league \(10<sup>th</sup> place\). In the second season and third seasons \(2017/18/19\) as the research was being conducted, the team improved to 8<sup>th</sup> place. In the final season \(2019\-20\) after the research was completed and fully integrated into the coaching approaches, the team finished in their highest league position of 6<sup>th</sup> with five wins **\[S2\]**. A former England captain and current member of the England squad has praised Bradley’s work, and expressed her gratitude for the support he gave to the players **\[S3\]**. 

 **Improved player health and welfare** 

 Having high quality data about player performance gives the club a better insight into whether players are over\- or underworked so they can train accordingly. Overworked players are more likely to sustain injuries, meaning that they may be unable to play, and injuries are more likely to be long term. Equally, underworked players risk injury by being insufficiently prepared. The team have also benefited from regular fitness and strength testing sessions across each of the 2017\-2020 seasons. Mean sprint times significantly improved from 3.55 s to 3.28 s and aerobic fitness test run performance times significantly improved from 6 minutes 3 s to 5 minutes 32 s, and significant improvements in strength for the bench press \(mean: 38.8 kg to 50.7 kg\) and back squat \(61.6 kg to 78.4 kg\) were observed **\[S4\]**. Additionally, lower than league average injury incidence in the 2017\-18 season, and a 27% decrease in total injuries and a 21% decrease in match\-related injuries from the 2018\-19 to the 2019\-20 seasons occurred **\[S5\]**.  The club now uses this data to identify and respond to individual players’ needs in training, and when making match selections, resulting in fitter players and stronger teams **\[S1\]**. 

 **Differences in women's and men's games are more widely understood** 

 An exclusive article in the Daily Telegraph reported on Bradley’s research and its implementation at the DMP Sharks during the 2018/19 season **\[S6\]**. The focus of the article, on differences in women’s and men’s games **\[R5\]**, has improved understanding of these distinctions among the Telegraph’s 317,817 print and 335,399 online readers, as well as the 38,000 people it was shared with across Twitter, including the former England Women’s captain **\[S7\]**. The story was picked up by the North\-East Chamber of Commerce, who commissioned an article exploring the application of the data to understand how female players perform **\[S8\]**. The research came to the attention of the USA Women’s National rugby team, who began using the research to support training session programming in December 2020 **\[S9\]**. 

 **DMP Sharks stand out for their use of state\-of\-the\-art sports science and technology** 

 Through their involvement in Bradley’s research, the team has access to specialist equipment such as GPS monitors and speed gates. The team uses GPS monitors to understand the amount of work a given player puts in during training and matches, measuring the proportion of running vs. walking, and how far they run. The monitors offer improved accuracy over the traditional method of visual observation. Speed gates have replaced stop watches, giving a more accurate measurement of player speed. Access to this technology has given the team a competitive advantage, since until recently no other team in the league had such unlimited access to GPS monitors **\[S1\]**.  At the beginning of the 2016\-17 season, the team had to apply for special dispensation from the RFU to allow players to wear GPS devices in game as this was previously prohibited in the domestic league. This led to the RFU amending their regulations in January 2017 to allow GPS monitoring during matches across the league. Individual players in the league have since opted to wear devices for personal monitoring, and the RFU provided GPS to teams in the league play\-offs and final in the 2017\-18 and 2018\-19 season. However, the Sharks remained unique in using GPS monitoring across the whole team and extensively benefit from the monitoring **\[S10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Between 1997 and 2007, 1,200 patients died unnecessarily at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, in part because poorly trained healthcare support workers \(HSW\) were providing frontline care. Professor Ian Kessler and colleagues at King’s Business School have addressed this shortcoming, generating the first evidence base on the training and development of HSWs. This evidence has prompted major government and organisational initiatives to improve the capabilities of HSWs, including the first national training and development strategy for this group of over 150,000 workers who dispense the majority of bedside care in NHS England. By contributing to the development of NHS\-led practitioner initiatives for HSWs, King’s researchers have helped to directly upskill a critical group of workers and, by empowering healthcare policymakers to make these changes, they have advanced the delivery of safer and more effective person\-centred frontline care. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The structure and management of the healthcare workforce has been subject to intense debate among policymakers and practitioners around the world as they strive toward improved service efficiency and effectiveness in the context of growing user demand and resource constraints. In a labour\-intensive sector where, despite technological advances, the delivery of frontline care principally involves face\-to\-face interaction between the employee and the patient, organisational responses to the pressures on service provision have increasingly centred on the workforce. 

 The healthcare support workforce has been an established part of the NHS labour force since the inception of the NHS 70 years ago. However, HSWs \(who work alongside and provide assistance to registered nurses\) have remained unregulated and unregistered, with limited research evidence available on the skills and capabilities post\-holders bring to—or develop within—the role. 

 This invisibility and the associated weak evidence base have assumed increasing significance to care providers as nurses withdraw from the bedside to take on more administrative responsibility and HSWs become the main providers of frontline care. The paucity of evidence has, moreover, generated concern about HSWs amongst government policymakers and local healthcare managers, who view HSWs as a ‘cheap’ but also high\-risk source of care. 

 Driven by significant failures in the care delivered by poorly trained but increasingly deployed HSWs in the NHS, Professor Ian Kessler and colleagues at King’s Business School have investigated how HSWs support care delivery. Building on work carried out at Oxford University into the nature and management of the HSW role, this research explored the interrelated areas of training and development needs of HSWs, career pathways and potential growth of new roles. 

 The research examined the training and development needs of HSWs, exploring whether and how such needs have been met and with what consequences, including those for care quality. Adopting a multi\-methods approach across four case studies of hospital trusts, King’s researchers addressed questions related to employee career pathways into the HSW role; the management of HSW training and opportunities for progression in the role; and the interactions between HSWs, patients and co\-workers. 

#  Investigating career pathways 

 Research was undertaken at four hospital trusts across the UK between 2007–2009. Data were collected from HSWs, nurses and patients using a variety of research techniques. Semi\-structured interviews were carried out with 82 HSWs and 90 nurses along with focus groups involving a total of 94 recently discharged patients. Interviews and focus groups were recorded and transcribed. In addition, 275 hours of on\-ward non\-participant observation were completed, involving the shadowing of 28 HSWs and 11 nurses across 11 wards. On each ward, up to three HSWs and one nurse were observed during their early shift. Finally, three surveys were carried out in the medical and surgical divisions of the case\-study hospitals for each of the stakeholders: HSWs \(n=746 total respondents; 51% response rate \(RR\)\); nurses \(n=689; 41% RR\); and recently discharged patients \(n=1,651; 51% RR\). 

 This research revealed that individuals come to the HSW role with few formal qualifications, but with demonstrable skills in and experience of care work \[1\]. While nurses were sometimes unsure of the purpose and role of HSWs \[2\], patients were often better able to engage with HSWs than with nurses, viewing them as a more accessible source of emotional support \[1\]. The research also found that many HSWs took up the role with a desire to pursue a nursing career, although this was a largely unfulfilled aspiration \[3\]. Despite clearly articulated development needs revealed by the research, HSW training and career management emerged as often disordered and poorly delivered by healthcare managers, producing ‘dead\-end’ jobs and de\-motivated HSWs \[3\]. 

#  Exploring training and development of innovative HSW roles 

 Funded by the National Institute of Health Research , a second stream of research produced rich case studies that captured the construction of advanced HSW roles such as colorectal support worker and surgical assistant practitioner \[4\]. This research uncovered the micro\-processes required for such roles to become embedded into the workplace: how the roles initially emerged with the support of workplace ‘champions’; how they became integrated into existing work routines; and how they established their legitimacy with co\-workers and patients. 

 Additional case studies compared various organisational approaches to the training and development of advanced HSW roles and found that a bottom\-up organic approach, sensitive to service design, proved more effective than a top\-down approach driven by financial pressures \[5\]. 

 This research also involved a survey on the incidence of advanced HSW roles across NHS England \[6\]. The survey highlighted the continued use of the role in general wards and its extension to specialist clinical areas including maternity and renal services. However, the research uncovered an absence of networking by employers and a desire for more sharing of best practice management of new HSW roles.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In the wake of catastrophic failures in healthcare and needless patient suffering, official inquiries placed considerable blame on the low standard of care delivered by poorly trained and managed HSWs. This was particularly the case with the Department of Health 2012 report on the abuse of patients with learning disabilities at the Winterbourne View hospital and the 2013 Francis Report on the unnecessary deaths at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust. Both reports suggested that the dilution of skill mix through the increased use of unregistered HSWs, in the context of financial pressures and ongoing difficulties recruiting registered nurses, contributed to the care failures. 

 Having explored these shortcomings and generating the first meaningful evidence base on the training and development of HSWs, King’s researchers were well placed to contribute to an upskilling of HSWs. Influencing the establishment of career pathways for individual HSWs and prompting national and strategic organisational initiatives to improve the knowledge and capabilities of HSWs, this work enabled HSWs to develop and better use their skills to increase productivity and to deliver safer and more effective care. 

#  Influencing the Creation of a National Strategy for HSW Training and Development 

 Published by Health Education England \(HEE\) in 2014, Talent for Care \(TfC\) \[A\] was the first ever national strategy for the training of HSWs in NHS England. King’s researchers were consulted by and made a formal presentation of their research findings to the HEE working group tasked with formulating this strategy \[B\]. Kirk Lower, National Lead for Talent for Care “was involved in the initial development of Talent for Care and as part of this remit met with Prof. Kessler to discuss his research findings, particularly on the training and development of health care assistants. Prof. Kessler also presented his research findings to the national stakeholder working group, chaired by Stephen Welfare, tasked with drafting Talent for Care” \[B\]. 

 Generating opportunities for HSWs to *Get In, Get On and Go Further* in the workplace, TfC sought to resolve the weaknesses in the training and development for this group of workers as revealed by King’s researchers, particularly given their increased replacement of nurses in bedside care \[2,3\]. In particular, the TfC strategy supported the construction of career pathways highlighted by King’s as previously under\-developed \[3\]. Such pathways were designed to encourage HSWs to progress through different support roles and into registered nursing, helping to meet HSW career aspirations and, in the process, address shortages of registered nurses \[A\]. 

 Given the disordered approach to HSW skills development highlighted by King’s \[3\], TfC also fostered a more formal approach to the assessment of HSW training needs through more ordered and regular individual performance reviews. Such reviews were integral to workforce planning and the general performance management of NHS trusts, as regularly assessed and rated by the Care Quality Commission. Moreover, given King’s evidence highlighting the ‘success’ of advanced support workers \[4,5\], TfC urged and nurtured the development of innovative support roles seen as contributing to organisational strategies designed to further the broader NHS policy goal of developing more person\-centred healthcare \[A\]. 

#  Evaluating the Positive Impacts of Talent for Care 

 Indicative of their expert contribution to the development of TfC, King’s researchers were invited by HEE to undertake an initial evaluation of the strategy in mid\-2016 \[C\]. As attested by Jane Hadfield, National Senior Programme Manager – Apprenticheships at HEE, the King’s report *“provided valuable insight into how Talent for Care was viewed and being used by Trusts in NHS England. It highlighted, in particular, the positive impact the strategy was having on organisational policy and practice, designed to improve support worker opportunities for training and development”* \[D\]. Comprising some 20 case studies of NHS Trusts, the evaluation found that TfC had gained considerable traction. Often for the first time, HSW training and development were being considered at board level, prompting changes in practice designed to increase recruitment to the HSW role, provide more structured training opportunities and allow career progression into more advanced roles. TfC’s positive impact was confirmed in a survey of healthcare providers in NHS England, undertaken by King’s as part of this evaluation. The survey found that close to one in two \(48%\) NHS Trusts in England had discussed TfC at board level; over half \(52%\) had developed a written plan for the implementation of TfC; and most \(83%\) agreed or strongly agreed that “TfC had provided a ‘useful’ framework for the training and development of HCSWs” \[C\]. In terms of new practice as suggested by TfC, the survey revealed that almost all Trusts \(94%\) had introduced a more robust induction programme for HSWs; over two\-thirds \(69%\) had developed formal competency frameworks for HSWs; and close to three\-quarters \(70%\) had established secondment schemes for HSWs to train as registered nurses \[C\]. 

 This prompted King’s researchers to convene four regional workshops attended by over 100 local practitioners, allowing attendees to explore and communicate ‘good’ practice on the training and development of HSWs. 

#  Refreshing Talent for Care: Creating New Career Pathways for HSW 

 In the context of policy shifts, the government’s encouragement of apprenticeship training in the NHS and the development of a new, registered advanced support role, HEE sought a follow\-up review of TfC designed to ensure its ongoing value to healthcare employers. HEE again turned to King’s researchers to assist in this review. Drawing on new case\-study and survey research, the re\-evaluation by King’s researchers \[E\] found that TfC had lost some momentum among healthcare employers as they placed increased emphasis on work experience as a route into the HSW role, sought to use apprenticeships as the basis for HSW training and endeavoured to address shortages of registered nurses. Vanessa Convey, National Senior Programme Manager \- Talent for Care at HEE, explained that “\[t\]he study findings directly informed the HEE process instigated to refresh the Talent for Care strategy” \[F\] and explicitly prompted HEE to work towards a refresh of TfC \[G\], ensuring it was better aligned with HSW training requirements and the evolving needs of healthcare employers. The refreshed TfC documentation is forthcoming. 

 The reevaluation also presented an opportunity for King’s researchers to highlight the need for an enhanced apprenticeship career pathway for HSWs that allowed them to progress into registered nursing. This pathway was launched in 2017 and is increasingly used by hospital Trusts, with Department of Education data for 2019 indicating around 1,150 individuals on the HSW apprenticeship, 1,600 on the Senior HSW apprenticeship and 1,200 on the nurse degree apprenticeship \[H\]. 

 The impact of King’s research through TfC on organisational policy and practice has also been apparent in the development of advanced Assistant Practitioner \(AP\) support roles. Indicating the ongoing and layered impact on workforce development, King's researchers were asked to investigate AP roles and commissioned by the NHS Assistant Practitioner Network to carry out a survey of the role \[6\]. The research has been used to dispel myths and give clear insight into what the role is and who might take it up. For example, the Royal College of Nursing makes direct reference to the King’s survey research in the information presented to encourage its HSW members to take up this role \[I\], with workforce data from NHS Digital indicate that the number of Assistant Practitioners in post has increased in recent years. Overall, therefore, this research at King’s has contributed to major government and organisational initiatives, improving the skills and prospects of HSWs and advancing the quality of healthcare in England.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our pioneering, digital platform empowers patients by offering detailed information about their condition and guidance to boost their health and quality of life. Our successful pilots, involving patients with diabetes, cancer, heart failure, renal disease and metabolic syndrome, showed a notable improvement in chronic disease control, health literacy and patient health engagement. For example: 

-  Reductions of 1.2% in body fat and 2.3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure for patients with Type 2 diabetes taking part in a study using our platform. 

-  For patients at risk of heart failure and renal disease taking part in our study, up to 24.3% increase in ‘empowerment’ to manage their own condition. 

-  As many as 81.5% participants in our cancer care study saw the added value of ICT\-aided healthcare on top of existing information management currently operating in their hospital. 

 Our platform has undergone a real\-world ‘assessment of value’ by the NHS, with Moorfield Eye Hospital using it to measure the efficacy of surgical interventions on patients’ lifestyle and freedoms. We are in discussions with Briteyellow Ltd about integrating our platform into their product for the private healthcare market. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Our research has the objectives of collecting comprehensive data from patients, real\-time information sharing and the provision of meaningful information to patients. The objectives are achieved through: 

-  Research on the Internet of Things \(IoT\), led by Prof Feng Dong, Dr Enjie Liu and Dr Hong\-Qing Yu since 2014, that helps our platforms to collect a wide\-range of health\-related data, both indoor and outdoor: 

  -  Protocols between the platform and Big Data for sensing data transmission 

  -  Interactive visual data analytics, such as visualisation, which identifies the topic of retrievals and selects the most relevant information from metadata to return to the user, integrated visual data analysis from heterogeneous data sources 

  -  Semantic temporal\-spatial data mining, and significant event mining. \( **3.1, 3.2**\) 

-  Research in Machine Learning \(ML\)\-based predictive modelling, led by Dr Vitaly Schetinin since 2010, that enables more accurate predictions of how health conditions will behave in the population, based on current and historic health data.  For example, this research discovered ineffective adaptation of learning strategies to training data that contain uncertainties. This was found to lead to inaccuracies in estimating the influence of uncertainties on a particular model’s efficacy. This finding has enabled learning strategies to efficiently reduce factors that generate redundant sub models during the learning process, which significantly improves the performance and accuracy of uncertainty estimation in modelling outputs \( **3.3**\). 

-  Research in information retrieval undertaken by Dr Ingo Frommholz and Dr Haiming Liu since 2014 focuses on the overall effectiveness of search engines under dynamic user\-machine interaction, which is expected to support the provision of more relevant health\-related items to patients. The emphasis is on the utilisation and generalisation of classical geometrical probability and logic spaces to model different forms of user search behaviour with Quantum Information Access theory. The exploration of direct integration into search engines is carried out, along with its underlying theory. \( **3.4**\) 

-  Dr Enjie Liu and Dr Sijing Zhang have led research in network/communication protocols to meet the possible challenges of real\-time, low\-power consumption, high\-reliability and security requirements in IoT\-based digital healthcare in the future. The achievements on Media Access Control \(MAC\) layers include enhancement of real\-time communication and energy saving MAC protocols \( **3.6**\). The research tackles technical issues involved in the network for multi\-media services, typically used in healthcare platforms. These include remote diagnosis, patient education and services that demand timely data transmission and low power consumption for terminals to operate optimally. The physical layer research \( **3.5**\) investigated outdoor\-indoor, indoor\-outdoor, and indoor\-outdoor\-indoor signal propagation for dual\-polarised MIMO channels in small cell environments, which are a typical scenario in IoT\-based healthcare. A reliable signal quality is essential.  Their research also developed a new approach to the detection of malicious attacks at the physical layer in the Gaussian relay system, allowing the system to work effectively in the presence of unreliable channel state information.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The trials of our digital health platforms were conducted as part of iManageCancer \( **5.1**\), MyHealthAvatar \( **5.2**\) and CARRE \( **5.6**\) projects. 

 The digital health platforms have been used to target chronic diseases, which count for a substantial share of patient care cost worldwide. For these diseases, self\-management has previously proved to be an efficient approach, but patient engagement has been challenging. The platforms are designed to ease the monitoring process and provide rich analytical data in order to improve engagement. Notable impacts are: 

-  **Reducing prolonged sitting time and improving glucose control in people with Type 2 diabetes** 

 20 patients recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes were recruited through Horizon Health Choices UK. They were randomly put into either a control group who received their normal care or the intervention group. The intervention group used the MyHealthAvatar \(MHA\) Diabetes app, which is the front end of the digital platform, for eight weeks, allowing the patients to enter and track their health and lifestyle information. 

 The app collects patients’ health\-related information from mobile devices, such as mobile phone and wrist watches. The data is then sent to a server to be analysed. Suggestions on exercises and diet, and warnings or reminders are generated from the analysis and sent to patients. Findings included the following: 

  

  -  Daily sitting was reduced by an average of 1.4% per day. While this may seem only a small change, it means that **intervention patients took an additional nine breaks from sitting each day. This is a significant outcome as** taking more breaks from sitting has been shown to reduce glucose levels over the day and night in people with Type 2 diabetes. 

  -  Fasting glucose was reduced by 0.28 mmol/L and the **glucose level following a 75g carbohydrate drink was reduced by 0.65mmol/L**, which is clinically important. It shows that the patients improved their ability to control glucose levels after consuming the carbohydrate. 

  -  **Body fat was reduced by 1.2%,** while diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 2.3mmHg. 

-  **Increasing health literacy among patients suffering from heart failure, chronic kidney diseases and metabolic syndrome** 

 40 patients at risk of heart failure and renal disease were recruited in two hospitals in Greece and Lithuania for a five\-month trial. The patients were directed to the CARRE platform, which visually presents knowledge and risk factors of chronic cardiorenal disease. Two visits to the patients were arranged in month two and month four of the pilot study defined by, and carried out by, the two hospitals. The comparison of the feedback from the patients showed \(with the formula improvement \(%\) = \(E2 – E1\)/E1\*100%\): 

  -  An overall increase in health literacy \(defined as the patient’s capability to obtain, process and understand health information\): 9.8% 

  -  An overall increase in empowerment \(defined as the process in which patients are encouraged to construct self\-regulation, self\-management and self\-efficacy in order to achieve maximum health and wellbeing\): 8.0%, with 12.4% among metabolic syndrome patients and 24.3% among heart failure and renal disease patients. 

-  **Improving Patient Health Engagement with ICT\-aided healthcare** 

 **A total of** 37 cancer patients \(22 breast cancer and eight prostate cancer patients recruited initially and a further seven later\) provided their feedback at the end of the trial in iManageCancer project in Pancretan Health Medical Centre, Greece. Results are below: 

|| Breast cancer patients | Prostate cancer patients |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Confident using the app | 55% | 75% |
| Found the various features of the platform useful | 65% | 63% |
| Would like to use this system frequently | 45% | 50% |
| Other patients would like to use the platform | 60% | 38% |
| The platform is an added value for the hospital | 100% | 63% |

 The survey results clearly showed that more than half of all patients agree that ICT\-aided healthcare is useful and acceptable for patient health engagement. More importantly, as many as 81.5% of participants saw the added value of ICT\-aided healthcare on top of the existing information management currently operating in their hospital. 

 The EC’s Innovation Radar, which identifies high potential in EU\-funded research and innovation projects, recognises the ‘noteworthy’ market creation potential for the platform \( **5.3**\). Bolstered by this positive feedback, we are in commercial discussion with Briteyellow Ltd about integrating our platform into its digital healthcare products. A non\-disclosure agreement \(NDA\) has been signed between the university and the company \( **5.7**\). 

 Moorfields Eye Hospital in Bedford is undertaking a further assessment to explore the impacts \( **5.4**\). The aim of the study is to assess the impact of interventions \(e.g. eye surgery\) on the quality of life \(QoL\) of visually impaired patients.  Levels of physical activity before and after the interventions are tracked by analysing data collected from sensors connected to MHA 

 In addition to our digital health platforms, our innovation of predictive modelling \- using ML developed in collaboration with Fusion Radiology \(UK\) and Stavropol regional hospital \(Russia\) in the EU\-funded Innovation Bridge project \( **5.5**\) \- has also had positive health impacts by **improving the accuracy of early detection of osteoarthritis.** Predictive models have been tested on high resolution X\-Ray images of knees in the early stages of the condition when the pathological changes in patients’ bones cannot be reliably quantified through standard radiologic tests at Stavropol regional hospital. Trials on 160 patients recruited for the study showed an improvement in accuracy between 7% and 9%. The algorithm will be used in the digital health platform to reinforce the modelling and prediction of patients’ health conditions.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted by Surrey’s Photonics & Quantum Sciences Group has played a transformative role in establishing UK SME Plastipack as a world leader in innovative swimming pool cover technology. Working in close collaboration with Plastipack, Surrey’s research has led to the successful development of mass\-producible polymer\-based functional materials for increased efficiency in solar heating of swimming pools, while simultaneously preventing the growth of algae. This led to the development of new products for the company resulting in a substantial increase in revenue and an Institute of Physics Business Innovation award in 2018.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Surrey’s experience in the advanced design and optical and electrical characterisation of photonics and electronic materials underpins the research that led to the innovations and impact as described here. Since its invention of the strained layer quantum well laser, the group has been successful in developing new optical and photonic materials for commercialisation. Some examples of this include local self\-uniform materials **\[R1\]** and new materials for high efficiency light sources **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 Owing to the Surrey group’s experience in the characterisation of thin films for photonic applications **\[R2, R3\]** and track record of engaging with industry **\[R4\]**, in 2011 Professor Sweeney was approached by Plastipack Ltd to help them to innovate their swimming pool\-covers. The research challenge was to create an affordable masterbatch \(the blend of additives introduced to the polymer during the extrusion manufacturing of the cover\) that would give selective transmission to maximise heating through solar radiation, while inhibiting photosynthesis to prevent algae growth, thus minimising use of chemicals harmful to the environment. This research project, led by Dr Steven Clowes, took the idea through all stages on the technology readiness scale \(from TRL1 to TRL9\). 

 Achieving the maximum solar heating from a pool cover, while inhibiting algae growth, requires a consideration of several factors. To prevent the algae growth, transmission of wavelengths below 750 nm must be filtered, whereas to heat the underlying water, the transmission of wavelengths around 750 nm must be optimised, while also considering the wavelength\-dependent absorption depths of water and the solar irradiance spectra. Existing heat models of swimming pools in the literature did not address the wavelength dependence of absorption and reflection in covers that is necessary to understand the heating performance of the selective transmission cover. The Surrey team developed new models for the solar energy balance **\[R5\]** and created simulations using finite element analysis. We studied how reflection is affected by the interaction of light with the pigments and the cover layer structure **\[R6\]** and explored non\-standard pigments **\[R5\]** to achieve the desired optical properties. Using the measured optical properties of the cover materials, these models were able to predict absolute solar heating efficiencies of the cover, i.e., the efficiency of converting solar energy into stored thermal energy in the pool’s water **\[R5\]**. Prior to a full large\-scale trial, laboratory\-based experiments were undertaken to optimise the composition of the cover material. 

 Through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Plastipack, the team designed a full\-scale test pool facility based at the company’s factory. This purpose\-built test facility provides five identical swimming pools with integrated temperature, radiation and weather data acquisition. Using this internationally unique facility, the Surrey team performed a full\-scale study to provide key empirical data to quantify the energy efficiencies of various cover materials. Our research showed that the selective\-transmission cover \(called new EnergyGuard™\) had a measurable efficiency of 56±3%, which is 12% higher than a standard opaque blue cover, while also retaining the algae inhibiting properties **\[R4\]**. Putting this into context, comparing with solar\-cell development, this magnitude of increase in the efficiency would take decades to achieve.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Established in 1998, Plastipack is a medium\-size UK company supplying a range of pool cover materials that cater for a diverse operating environment. Their business strategy of leading through innovation led them to develop their patented GeoBubble™ cover design prior to their collaboration with the University of Surrey. Our research has enabled Plastipack to maintain their position as leading innovators and stay ahead of commercial rivals in a very competitive market. 

###  Economic benefits of an internationally leading product 

 Laboratory based research at Surrey developed a patented **\[S1\]** low\-density polyethylene \(LDPE\) formula **\[R5\]** which enabled Plastipack’s existing opaque cover material \(EnergyGuard™\) to have wavelength selective transmission. Critical to success of this product was the ability to provide customers \(an international network of swimming pool cover suppliers\) with empirical evidence of the enhanced performance of the new EnergyGuard™ material **\[S2\]**.  The creation of the research test facility **\[S3\]** and the demonstration of experimental evidence, both led by Surrey, enabled the company to provide scientific data on the benefits of their products. The new EnergyGuard™ product was launched in 2015 and sales of this product saw a more than sixfold increase by 2020 **\[S4\]**. Sales of this product continue to grow, with a 41% market share increase in 2020 despite the pandemic and the company has now sold nearly 2 million square metres of the new EnergyGuard™ cover **\[S4\]**. This is equivalent to approximately 62,500 covered swimming pools. Owing to our research, it is possible to quantify the economic and environmental impact of this product using the cover efficiencies as measured from the pool test facility based at Plastipack and the analysis **\[R4\]**. With the success of the new EnergyGuard™, Plastipack have been able to expand their patented GeoBubble™ materials from 42% in 2015 to 59% in 2020, with their Guard high performance covers now representing between 21\-27% of their total production **\[S4\]**. Since the KTP project, Plastipack has increased its total number of staff by 18, representing a 156% increase **\[S4\]**. In November 2018, the research collaboration between Plastipack and Surrey was recognised with the Institute of Physics Business Innovation Award **\[S5\]**, cementing Plastipack’s standing as the leading innovator in the sector. 

###  Economic impact of environmental efficiency 

 Key to the success of the EnergyGuard™ cover is its environmental efficiency, which also provides economic benefit to Plastipak’s customers **\[S6\]**. We showed that the selective transmission cover has a measured heating efficiency of 56%, compared with an opaque cover with an efficiency of 44%. Most of the new cover material is sold to the European market, which is typically used in the spring and autumn months to extend the swimming pool season. For the covers currently in use worldwide, as at 2020, we can show that by reducing the need for electrical pool heating, this corresponds to a CO<sub>2</sub>e saving of over 28,800 tonnes per year **\[S7\]** when replacing a standard opaque cover with the new EnergyGuard™. This is combined with the prevention of algae blooms which require concentrated chlorine \(shock\) treatments to remove. These high levels of chlorine can be harmful to the environment and human health. 

###  Economic Benefit of an embedded culture of innovation 

 Another major impact of this initial research project was that Plastipack were able to embed this knowledge within the company. Using the new research facility and continuing the partnership with Surrey, which included the optical characterisation of new materials and analysis of the energy balance, Plastipack has improved the performance of their other products. This has been achieved in conjunction with our undergraduate professional training year placement programme **\[S8\]** from the University of Surrey \(five student placements as at 2020\). A good example of success is the enhanced performance of their CoolGuard™ cover, now branded Ultra CoolGuard™ **\[S9\]** which maximises reflection of solar irradiation to maintain a pool temperature in hot climates. This new product was launched in 2018, and its development would not have been possible without the original research on the EnergyGuard™ product at Surrey. Plastipack has continually innovated their products through Surrey research, and in doing so, they have been able to stay ahead of international competitors. As quoted by Peter Adlington, Managing Director of Plastipack, “If we hadn’t have gone down this route, we really wouldn’t be here today.” **\[S10\]**.

1.  Calculation of energy saving: For a latitude of 45°\(South of France\) the typical daily solar irradiation is 8.98 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>  per day in months of April and May and 7.86 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>  per day in August and September when it would be used to extend the swimming pool season. Using a cloud cover factor of 0.65 and assuming that the cover is in use for 5 days out of 7 in the total 120 days, the total solar energy is \(8.98 \+ 7.86\) x 0.65 x60 x \(5/7\) = 470 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>. For 2,000,000 m<sup>2</sup>  and a 12% enhanced efficiency **\[R5\]**, the increased energy saving per year is 2.0x10<sup>6</sup> x 470 x 0.12 = 9x10<sup>7</sup> kWh. At cost of UK grid electricity \(0.256 CO<sub>2</sub>e/KWh, UK Government\) this corresponds to 28,800 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at Buckinghamshire New University \(BNU\) has resulted in the delivery of innovative education services and enhanced student learning and participation in Eastern Europe.  Specifically, this research has led to the development of Entrepreneurship Education programmes tailored to particular needs in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, has led to creating an organisational framework for the involvement of students in EE programmes, and has led to the validation and implementation of the EE programmes in five Eastern European universities.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Entrepreneurship Education \(EE\) at higher education institutions has gained significant importance and has become a global phenomenon. Policy makers regard entrepreneurial Education as a tool to solving complex societal problems. In its attempt to assist Eastern Neighbouring countries with their social and economic development, the EU has funded a plethora of projects aimed at developing the capacity of higher education. BNU has led, alongside other universities and companies from the EU, the development, implementation and testing of EE programmes in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. 

 A plethora of approaches has been used to measure the impact of EE programmes throughout the world. Very few studies have been conducted to assess student’s opinions regarding the relevance of the EE in Eastern Europe. Research led by Dorin Festeu has concluded that students understand the importance of the theory but prefer involvement in real life activities under the guidance of real entrepreneurs. This research has led to structuring the implementation of an EE programme within an EU funded project during 2014\-2015. \[1\] 

 The research that led to the development of a delivery framework of EE programme in Eastern European neighbouring countries constituted the basis for the implementation of a successful €1.3 Mil project within the TEMPUS programme of the European Commission. \[2\] 

 Although there is a strong research base that led to structuring EE programmes in the western world there is very little research to inform the structure and content of such programmes in Eastern Europe. Research led by Dr Dorin Festeu \[2\] has led to the identification of the structure of an EE programme tailored to universities in the region. The research has been used as a theoretical framework for a bid for funding within the TEMPUS programme of the European Commission. 

 The research assessing learners’ opinions on the structure, content and mode of delivery of EE programmes has led to the development of a successful application for funding, €570,000, within the Erasmus Plus programme of the European Commission. 

 Research that underpinned the publication of the articles “Entrepreneurship Education Programme \-students’ opinions” \[1\] and “Entrepreneurship Education programme tailored to Eastern European neighbouring countries” \[2\] was conducted in 2014\-2015 and 2017\-2018 respectively. Dorin Festeu of BNU was the academic coordinator of the Erasmus SUCSID project and led the development of the EE programme. SUCSID project was co\-led by Montpellier University and Buckinghamshire New University represented by Dorin Festeu. Montpellier University was the financial coordinator and BNU was the academic coordinator. Dorin Festeu has designed the data collection method and led the collection and the analysis of the data for the two articles. The co\-authors of the published articles translated the text for participants in Moldavian and Russian and contributed to the identification of country specific literature sources.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Entrepreneurship Education \(EE\)  programme was developed based on the research conducted in Eastern European universities \[2\] and was the central piece that supported the establishment of eight Start\-up Centres in universities in: Belarus National Technical University; The Academy of Economic Science of Moldova; Komrat State University\-Moldova; Kharkiv National University of Civil Engineering and Architecture\-Ukraine; Ternopil National Technical University\-Ukraine; Sumy State University\-Ukraine; Kharkiv National University of Economics\-Ukraine; National University for Municipal Economy in Kharkiv\-Ukraine. \[5.A and 5.D\]. 

 The research \[1\] was disseminated through a series of 52 dissemination events in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine \[5.D p.1\] and the results supported the validation of an Entrepreneurship Education Masters level programme in five top universities: Belarus National Technical University;  Komrat State University\-Moldova; Kharkiv National University of Civil Engineering and Architecture\-Ukraine; Sumy State University\-Ukraine; National University for Municipal Economy in Kharkiv\-Ukraine. Validation approval documents issued by each of the above mentioned universities are presented in \[5.B\]. The modules that were recommended in the research led by BNU \[2\] were those that were validated. The five universities have validated the EE programme containing the following modules: Innovation management; Entrepreneurship; Start\-up projects business planning; Leadership and start\-up team management and intellectual property law. \[5.B\]. The validated EE programme encourages students to learn how to set\-up and run a business and triggers the enrollment of over 200 students per year, \[5.D\] 

 The establishment of the start\-up centres and the validation of the EE programme has had a positive impact on universities’ ability to deliver learning experiences that helped students meet their educational needs, were relevant to their future career and equipped students with appropriate skills. Evidence to support this claim is reflected in the evaluation conducted with those students who participated in the EE programme \(The EE programme was titled: Innovation Development and Promotion Programme\-\(IDP\). “ *The course has met my educational needs\-to a high level*”\-87% of the 319 participants; “ *The modules were highly relevant*”\-78%; “ *The modules have equipped me with the appropriate skills and knowledge to enhance my practice*.”\-85% \[5.C p.32\-37; p.66; p.93; p.134; p.159; p.184; p.211; p.239\]. 

 The modules, developed to encourage entrepreneurial activities, were delivered outside the classroom offering students the opportunity to experience a ‘learning by doing’ approach which is innovative in these countries where most of the learning is exclusively theoretical \(Bondarchuk et.al., 2019; Pogorevici, 2019\). Research is currently underway to assess the long\-term impact of these programmes on the number of students who do go on to establish their own business. 

 The documents submitted as sources to corroborate the impact were selected from the Final Report submitted to the Executive Agency of the European Commission \(EACEA\). The reports were assessed by EACEA evaluators and the SUCSID project has been rated as “good”. Narrative evaluation was also provided. Quotes from the EACEA evaluation letter \[5.D\] \(p1\) states that: “ *In particular we estimate that the project registered a good achievement level and impact, as confirmed by the field monitoring visits carried out in Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine by the National Erasmus\+ Offices*.” Another quote from the EACEA evaluation letter concludes: “ *Regarding sustainability, we acknowledge that dedicated admin staff has been appointed to support the start\-up centres, and that over 50 institutional partnerships & cooperation agreements have been signed with local and national enterprises. This will certainly contribute to the long\-term sustainability of the centres and will guarantee commercial opportunities for the entrepreneurial ideas of the students. Furthermore, we are pleased to learn that some 200 students have enrolled to the newly\-developed courses and that enterprises are now aware that universities could provide services and could be a credible partner for the training of their staff. Some enterprises even became active members of the start\-up centres. This will also add to the project's long\-lasting impac*t.” \[5.D\]. 

 Obtaining funding that led to the development of the start\-up centres, validation of the EE programme tailored to Eastern European universities and implementation of the EE programme was the direct result of the research led by BNU.

Much research focuses on identifying and implementing effective tools for managing existing firms and means to make entrepreneurs successful. We also find several business spinoffs from research or adaptations of research into large companies, often by providing high end software and production management or art and design tools for companies. A large number of impact projects are concerned with helping small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) grow and with creating business environments, organisational practices, public policies, investments and financing programs that help them thrive, particularly in economically challenging regions of the UK. Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Biogeotextile mats made from the leaves of Buruti palm trees \( *Mauritia flexuosa*\) were used to treat approximately 4,000m<sup>2</sup> of severely eroded gullied land within Maranhão State, Brazil. Over several years, the biogeotextiles stabilised the land and encouraged progressive regrowth of vegetation across over 50,000m<sup>2</sup>. This benefited the area, both in terms of multiple environmental impacts, including increased resistance to soil erosion and increased floral and faunal biodiversity. Furthermore, socio\-economic benefits to the local community included financial gain from the crops \(leaves, fruit and oil\) of Buruti palm trees subsequently planted in the area. Additional impacts were evident in providing stabilised land for the construction of multiple housing units and the development of environmental education programmes related to the project.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning this case study has been conducted since 2000, led by Professor Mike Fullen of the University of Wolverhampton, resulted in the creation of novel organic biogeotextile mats. These mats are designed to stabilise land, improve water conservation and decrease soil erosion. They are designed in a grid arrangement, usually as 50x50cm squares to allow them to be easily pinned into the ground. Traditionally, such mats have been made of synthetic materials, such as nylon. However, further research at the University of Wolverhampton led to the design of environmentally\-friendly biogeotextile versions of the mats, made from organic materials \(Figure 1\). The following Findings \[F\] underpin the impacts claimed: 

 <ins>F1. Effectiveness of</ins> <ins>biogeotextiles</ins> <ins>for soil and water conservation</ins> 

 Initial research on geotextile mats began at the University of Wolverhampton in 2000, resulting in the following findings: 

1.  Geotextile mats can significantly decrease runoff and soil erosion rates by up to 98% \[R1\]. 

1.  Field comparison of multiple biogeotextile fibres identified that the West African palm tree species *Borassus aethiopium* effectively decreases soil erosion rates \[R1\]. 

 Following this initial research to analyse the effectiveness of these biogeotextile mats, a multi\-national project named the ‘BORASSUS Project’ was launched in 2005. Led by Professor Fullen, this initiative also involved research institutions from Africa \(The Gambia and South Africa\), Asia \(China, Thailand and Vietnam\), Europe \(Belgium, Hungary and Lithuania\) and South America \(Brazil\). Research from this project led to further refinements of these mats, investigating various organic fibres and uses within different environments, particularly in developing countries. 

 <ins>F2.</ins> <ins>Biogeotextile</ins> <ins>mats are effective in promoting soil and water conservation in Brazil</ins> 

 Further research confirmed the biogeotextile mats as an effective tool for reducing soil erosion. In particular, results highlighted the potential for their use on Brazilian humid\-tropical soils: 

1.  Biogeotextile mats are highly effective in intercepting the kinetic energy of raindrops and thus decreasing rain\-splash erosion \[R2\]. 

1.  Biogeotextiles slow down the velocity of surface runoff and thus increase infiltration rates into soil systems. In turn, decreased runoff volume and velocity decreases soil erosion rates \[R2\]. 

1.  The mats are suitable for and effective on Brazilian humid\-tropical soils \(Oxisols and Ultisols\) \[R3\]. 

 <ins>F3.</ins> <ins>Buruti</ins> <ins>palm leaves are an effective material for</ins> <ins>biogeotextile</ins> <ins>mats in Brazil</ins> 

 To ensure the mats were economically\-viable in Brazil, a local and readily\-available source of fibres was required for production. The Buruti \( *Mauritia flexuosa*\) palm tree was selected as a suitable option for the production of the mats \(Figure 1\). This Brazilian species is similar to the West African Borassus palm tree, which had been previously identified as an effective material for the mats \[R1\]: 

1.  The Buruti biogeotextile mats were effective for both soil and water conservation \[R2, R3\]. 

1.  With careful woodland management, the crop of Buruti palm leaves was sustainable \[R4\]. 

1.  The mats were inexpensive and thus economically\-viable \[R5\]. 

 <ins>F4.</ins> <ins>Biogeotextile</ins> <ins>mats are an effective tool for the rehabilitation of gullied land</ins> 

 Severely gullied land is a difficult substrate for natural vegetation to establish and grow. Findings identified that the biogeotextiles were effective in stabilising gullies and activating a progressive series of environmental benefits, e.g. increased soil organic matter and soil organic carbon contents, improved soil structure and stability, increased water infiltration rates and water storage in soils, and increased biodiversity of both flora and fauna\) \[R4, R5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Impacts discussed below focus on the Community of Salina do Sacavém, which is in the suburbs \( *favelas*\) of the City of São Luís, the capital of Maranhão State, north\-east Brazil. Researchers from the State University of Maranhão and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro \(both University partners in the BORASSUS Project\) led the impact project, which has so far used the biogeotextiles mats \[F1\-F4\] to substantially improve an area of previously severely gullied, eroded and degraded land. Prior to treatment, the area was poorly managed, leaving it as unprofitable waste\-land and even a safety risk to visitors. 

 Over 16,000 Buruti palm leaf biogeotextile mats were installed across approximately 4,000m<sup>2</sup> area of severely sloping eroded land \[C1\]. This stabilised the ground and allowed gently sloping areas to be levelled as terraces \(Figure 2\). These bioengineering techniques, combined with a re\-vegetation programme, led to the eventual stabilisation of over 50,000m<sup>2</sup> \(5 hectares\) of land \[C1\]. 

 The initial treatment with the Buruti palm at Salina do Sacavém was undertaken in 2007, and over time re\-vegetation was possible, which progressively improved and increased over time. This has led to various substantial impacts on the local area between August 2013 and December 2020, from environmental improvements \[I1\], to specific socio\-economic benefits to the community \[I2\], to the area being used as a tool for a University\-led environmental education programme \[I3\]. 

 <ins>I1. Environmental benefits due to land stabilisation</ins> 

 Regular monitoring and field surveys since August 2013 highlight substantial environmental benefits in the area thanks to the environmental engineering and land stabilisation programme. Identified effects on soil system dynamics included increased soil organic matter \(and thus soil organic carbon\) contents, decreased soil erosion, decreased soil erodibility and increased water infiltration into the stabilised soils. Related biotic effects included the development of permanent grass and woodland vegetation and increased floral and faunal biodiversity \[C2\]. The Head of Geography at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, stated that: 

 “We have seen incredible environmental improvements on the stabilisation plantation land at Salina do Sacavém since 2013. These improvements are particularly evident in the stabilization of the gullies, improved soil physico\-chemical properties and increases in both the number and biodiversity of species of flora and fauna” \[C2\]. 

 These improvements highlight specifically how the biogeotextile mats have turned an area of unproductive wasteland into an area which now substantially benefits the local ecosystem. 

 <ins>I2. Benefits to the local community living near the stabilised land</ins> 

 Some 3500 families live within 500m of the Salina do Sacavém gullies. Their incomes are relatively low compared with local averages, with most working in the poorly paid service sector and many unemployed. Therefore, any opportunity to supplement incomes is particularly beneficial for these families. 

 In an interview in 2020, the President of the Association of Housewives of Salina do Sacavém highlighted the benefits she has observed resulting from the improved land stability. She cited an “end to landslides in the area” \[C3\], which were previously a significant danger in the area. She also indicated that an “end of accidents with children who use the gully as an entertainment area” \[C3\]. 

 After treatment with the mats, the area was planted with over 500 Buruti palm trees, which were fully mature and producing fruit by 2013. The Research Professor on the project, from the State University of Maranhão, commented on the socio\-economic benefits produced by the environmental improvements at Salina do Sacavém: 

 “The community has enjoyed considerable benefits from the land stabilization project. These benefits include increased income from selling products from the Buruti trees, including artefacts produced from woven leaves and fruit products \(such as juice and ice cream\). The local people also use the crop of palm oil. As the agro\-forestry plantation matures, these benefits have progressively increased. Between August 2013 \- December 2020 we estimate that these products sold for about 12,000\* Brazilian Reals” \(\*approximately GBP1700 as of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020\). 

 In a very poor area, the ability for the local community to subsidise low incomes is a significant benefit resulting from the project. 

 <ins>I3. Impacts on educational advancement in</ins> <ins>Maranhão</ins> <ins>State</ins> 

 As well as the benefits discussed above, the project has undertaken an education programme with local children, young people and adults over several years. The project was initiated in 2005, but has run ever since. Delivered by trained school teachers, the education programme provides classes at the local community centre, and conducts field visits for local people to study the stabilised area \[C1\]. The Research Professor on the project from the State University of Maranhão, who leads the education project, stated: 

 “The program aimed to stimulate interest in environmental issues in the Community of Salina do Sacavém. The program established relationships between preservation, recovery and improving the quality of life. In addition, the program ensured on\-going interaction between the community and the BORASSUS Project. The local people learnt a great deal about the recovery of degraded land using soil bioengineering techniques and the economic potential of biogeotextiles constructed using Buriti fibres.” 

 He further identified that he has seen benefits from the programme in terms of “increased environmental awareness and the generally improved educational performance of local school students” \[C1\]. 

 In 2020 the Research Professor and the President of the Association of Housewives discussed the impacts of the education programme on the local community. The outcomes of this discussion showed the significant importance of the programme in improving the environmental awareness of local people \[C4\]. The community leader particularly highlighted impacts on gender equality and that thanks to the programme “women have become much more involved in local environmental projects” \[C4\]. The continuing educational aspirations of the project are further evidenced by a webinar conducted on 14<sup>th</sup> August 2020 \[C5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Peck, Stewart and Middleton are engaged in research projects in Papua New Guinea \(PNG\) and Ecuador that have established forest conservation areas and sustainably improved the lives of local communities. Impacts include: 

-  Conservation of more than 16,000ha of forest in Ecuador and PNG, protecting them from logging. 

-  Generation of sustainable livelihoods for forest communities by providing well\-paid local employment for ‘para\-ecologists’ to support biodiversity research, establishment of Fairtrade organic chocolate production, and developing ecotourism. 

-  Health service provision for indigenous forest communities, including establishment of a permanent nurse\-staffed aid post, to incentivise and expand forest conservation.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Ecuador is a ‘hyperdiverse country’ with the highest density of mammalian species worldwide, the highest deforestation rate in South America and 2,301 species at risk of extinction \- the highest globally. In response, in 2005, Dr Peck created an international team that worked with forest communities to pioneer the ‘paraecologist approach’ and generate the scientific information needed to conserve Ecuador’s threatened wildlife. Focusing on the brown\-headed spider monkey, one of the top 25 most\-endangered primates globally, they faced the challenge of identifying remaining populations of a rare primate in large areas of rainforest. His group used a combination of satellite imagery, computer modelling and mapping of threats to identify potential forest harbouring the primate \[R1\]. Having narrowed down the search, the team then applied an innovative rapid\-assessment method \(based on audio responses\) to confirm the presence and numbers of primates remaining in the wild. This combination of analyses allowed his team to identify a priority area in NW Ecuador requiring urgent protection – now the 2,000ha Tesoro Escondido Spider Monkey Reserve \(TESMR\) – established by Peck and the local community \[R1\]. The TESMR model integrates community in conservation, building on the experience of the 730 ha Santa Lucia Reserve Research Station \(SLRRS\) in the Ecuadorian Andes also established by Peck. The protected areas generate scientific information on biodiversity to guide sustainable development \[S5\] and create local income and training for paraecologists, students and researchers. 

 The island of New Guinea includes the world’s third largest rainforest, supporting 5% of global biodiversity. However, 24% of PNG’s forest has been cleared or degraded in the last 30 years. Furthermore, medical neglect, especially in remote areas, has left the most prevalent causes of health problems mostly unchanged for fifteen years; life expectancy is low and maternal and infant mortality rates are high. Since 2001, Dr Stewart has been part of an international collaboration of ecologists working in PNG \(funded by the UK Government’s Darwin Initiative\) that has: \(i\) established and trained teams of para\-ecologists to study the hyper\-diverse forest ecosystems \[R2\]; \(ii\) studied patterns of insect diversity and host\-plant specificity \[R3\] in tropical forests; \(iii\) estimated carbon preserved by protecting 10,000ha of primary forest equivalent to the carbon footprint of 1.47 million transatlantic flights \[R4\]; \(iv\) established a Complete Altitudinal Rainforest Transect \(CART\), running from near sea\-level to the tree\-line \(3,700m\) with 8 research stations at 500m intervals, designed to act as a proxy for the impacts of climate change on various taxonomic groups \[S4\]; \(v\) assessed the health needs of remote village communities \[R5\] to inform Stewart and Middleton’s establishment of health services for approximately 2,000 people \[R6\]. 

 This community\-based ‘para\-ecologist model’ has proved to be an efficient way to conduct data gathering and research by integrating local and scientific knowledge. In effect, the model has built local engagement and employment around the research process itself, generating world\-leading research outputs in tropical ecology \[R3, R4\] and health \[R5, R6\], embedding evidence\-based conservation at the community level \[R2\], bringing critically endangered species back from the brink of extinction and winning international recognition for its approach \[S2, S3, S4\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Conservation of tropical forests and their exceptionally high biodiversity in Ecuador and Papua New Guinea presents unique challenges due to poor central governance and traditional land ownership residing predominantly with remote village communities. Establishment of protected areas therefore requires community engagement, which the team has achieved through education, training, developing novel employment opportunities, alternative livelihoods and health services provision. 

###  Establishment, expansion and enhancement of Protected Areas 

 Research to identify the priority area for conservation of the critically endangered brown headed spider monkey in NW Ecuador \[R1\] underpinned successful Royal Geographical Society funding to work with forest communities to identify conservation strategies in 2012 \[S1\], including establishment of a protected area. This co\-produced research \[R1, S1\] was key to Peck sourcing initial funding for land purchase in 2015 \(GBP800,000, Scott Rasmussen Foundation\) and initiating land purchase through the University of Sussex and local partners Cambugan Foundation \[S2\]. With 2,000ha of forest purchased by 2016, the Tesoro Escondido Spider Monkey Reserve was transferred to a local non\-governmental organisation \(Jocotoco Foundation\) in 2019 with a clear mandate for autonomous community\-based management \[S2\], which was identified as critical following community engagement research \[S1\]. It now protects approximately 150 brown\-headed spider monkey individuals \(60% of the global population\) in addition to other critically endangered and endangered species \(i.e. Canandé Magnolia, Mache Glass Frog, Great Green Macaw, Baudó Guan, Banded Ground\-cuckoo, Ecuadendron Tree\) in this global biodiversity hotspot. The project is recognised by the IUCN, where the Tesoro Reserve, “working under a community participation model … now protects 20 km<sup>2</sup> \[2,000ha\] of rainforest habitat and has brought the species \[brown\-headed spider monkey\] back from the brink of extinction” \(Diego Tirira, lead of the Primates IUCN Specialist Group\) \[S3\]. The importance of research is highlighted by Dr Citlalli Morelos: “the existence of this reserve and the conservation of almost 20 km<sup>2</sup> of forest in one of the most biologically important forest systems globally, where over 95% of the forest has been lost, can be attributed to the research and active conservation work undertaken by Dr Peck” \[S2\]. 

 In PNG, Stewart helped establish Binatang Research Center \(BRC\) in 2001 which supported the remote village of Wanang in declaring two\-thirds \(10,000ha\) of its rainforest as a legal entity in 2005 \(Wanang Conservation Area, WCA\), protecting it from logging operations that completely surround it. This collaboration has continued to impact on conservation efforts in the current REF period, as described by BRC collaborator Prof Novotny: 

 “As a direct result of this collaboration, the PNG Conservation and Environment Protection Agency is now planning its \[the WCA’s\] designation as a national protected area. Further, our joint projects have also \[in 2018\] facilitated mapping and preparation of another 20,000 ha rainforest conservation along a 41km complete altitudinal transect from the lowlands to Mt. Wilhelm, the PNG’s highest mountain. The Sussex University research has also been the main driver for establishing health service provision in the Wanang community \[since 2016, see below\], thereby incentivising the protection of an additional 4,500 ha of forest from further logging or conversion to agriculture. This includes the creation of buffer zones around the WCA and enhanced protection and monitoring of vulnerable species within it. … The joint projects with the Sussex University represent one of the most sustained and impactful collaborations in biodiversity research and conservation in PNG in the past 20 years.” \[S4\] 

###  Enhanced sustainable livelihoods in challenging remote settings 

 Ecological research in hyper\-diverse tropical forest communities requires large teams of skilled staff. Stewart and Peck helped pioneer the concept of ‘para\-ecologists’ \[R2\]: locally recruited staff who receive training to complete tasks such as: collecting field data, conducting experiments, databasing and preliminary analysis. These highly motivated nationals then become the best advocates for conservation in their communities. In conflict situations, local community involvement has ensured protection, eliminating the need for park guards as local communities engage directly to address threats. Stewart and Peck have applied the para\-ecologist concept at the BRC \[S4\] in PNG \(one of the three top para\-ecologist teams in the world \[S4\]\), the community\-owned SLRRS \[S5\] and the TESMR \[S2\], in NW Ecuador, resulting in benefits for science and local communities: 

1.  Providing attractive careers for para\-ecologists through training in research and conservation within the community: since August 2013, approximately 75 trained in PNG, more than 100 in Ecuador, and 8 PNG nationals brought to the UK for intensive training. Many have progressed to other posts in science, including several prestigious senior positions. In Ecuador the TESMR is now a “pioneer in empowering local people long\-term to transition to sustainable livelihoods and conservation of their environments through our paraecologist programme” \[S2\]. Dr Bito, trained by Sussex as a PNG Masters student, and appointed in 2018 as Principal Entomologist to the Queen Alexandra Bridwin Butterfly conservation project in PNG, reflects that “my early years at BRC, including those working on Dr Stewart’s project, provided a crucial launchpad for where my career took me subsequently… My career is an exemplar of the broad impacts that come from research that is fully embedded in the community and fully invests in the people that are involved” \[S4\]. 

1.  Sustainably improving local economies, through supporting biodiversity research by visiting scientists, students, volunteers and ecotourists, who pay land fees for forest access, employ local research assistants and guides and pay for food and accommodation. This sustainable livelihood model has gained international recognition for impact by winning the prestigious 2015 United Nations Development Programme’s Equator Prize for the Wanang community \[S6\]. In Ecuador, the SLRRS in 2019 generated 70% \(USD95,000\) of their annual income through ‘scientific tourism’ \[S5\], hosting over 380 undergraduate and postgraduate students from 2014 – 2020 that has resulted in “the community\-run cooperative to finally establish and maintain stable work conditions for community and other staff members. For the first in time in the history of Santa Lucía the cooperative was able to offer long\-term contracts, including public health insurance” \[S5\]. 

1.  Leveraging additional finance from private sources. In Ecuador, ongoing annual funding of USD120,000, initially sourced by Peck from Synchronicity Earth \(2015\), allows the TESMR to “employ 5 full\-time paraecologists, cover costs of our research programme and administration, and cover my \[reserve director\] salaries” \[S2\]. 

1.  Translating scientific research into educational outreach programmes, informing policy at local and national levels and underpinning practical, grassroots conservation action and livelihoods. Research into alternative livelihood options for communities in and around the TESMR by Peck and Client Earth \[S7\] in 2013 identified opportunities to simultaneously boost income and conservation; working with local cacao producers, they helped establish the ‘Washu’ Chocolate Project \[S7\] in 2015, which works with Ecuadorian farmers to ensure fair prices in return for halting deforestation and engaging in reforestation around Tesoro Reserve. Martin Simmoneau of the Washu Project comments: “Dr Peck, the University of Sussex … can be very proud of what they’ve achieved in terms of meeting development and conservation targets ... This project is a great example of a success story that goes beyond stats and impact. It is as much about using compassion, solidarity and the diversity in human cultures and knowledge to achieve conservation targets” \[S7\]. Since 2017 the TESMR has also addressed food security by training 30 local women in agroecology and permaculture \(1\-year course\) that now includes collaboration with the Ministry of Education to include 11 schools \(700 pupils/teacher training\). Commenting on the influence of the research collaboration with Sussex in PNG, Prof Novotny concludes that “overall, it is a testament to the impact that ongoing research programmes can have on conservation of key habitats, but also on a community that is integrated into the scientific work” \[S4\]. 

###  Health service provision for remote communities 

 Building on existing collaborations with the Wanang community, Stewart and Middleton have introduced medical services to improve community health and incentivise continued forest protection and conservation area expansion. In 2016 research by Stewart and Peck the Wanang community identified “health care, absent from the village … as the main missing service at present” \[S8\]. In response, in 2018 Middleton led a combined clinical and rapid anthropological assessment of health service needs \[R5\]. This was the first time a doctor had ever been to Wanang; over half the community were examined and 63 urgent cases were treated on\-site \(including malaria, tropical skin diseases, respiratory infections\). Data from this assessment provided the evidence of medical need for a nurse\-staffed clinic which opened in 2020, built and staffed with funds obtained by Stewart and Middleton \[proposal, S9\]. This is providing primary care for the first time for 2,000 people in 10 remote villages where the nearest pharmacy or hospital is a two\-day walk away \[R6\]. The Aid Post was registered with Madang Provincial Health Authority in 2020, securing its long\-term funding beyond the existing Sussex\-held research grant from the Darwin Initiative which is evaluating its impact on conservation outcomes and community health \[S9\]. As there is no ambulance service in the area, Middleton trained and supplied a new 11\-strong evacuation team for the Wanang area in 2019, consisting of parabiologists from BRC \[S9\]. New conservation and no\-impact areas were declared in 2020 as a consequence of the University of Sussex health intervention \[map, S9\]. 

 This success in PNG has also been paralleled in Ecuador where, since 2017, the Tesoro Escondido Reserve has provided medical training to local health centre medics and annual first aid training to 30 people \(3\-month course\). The significance of this impact in both locations is expressed by Filip Damen, Chair of the Wanang Health Committee: 

 “the Wanang community appreciate and thank Alan Stewart, Jo Middleton, and Mika Peck of the University of Sussex SSRP\-Darwin funded project for the health needs assessment and urgent treatments in 2018 and the resultant newly build Aid post. University of Sussex has taken the initiative to give this Aid post to Wanang community that is very unique and outstanding in most of the rural areas in PNG ... University of Sussex’s involvement in the community, and its contribution will encourage us, our people and our children in Wanang community to work in collaboration to support and look after our forest, rivers and land to maintain this conservation project.” \[testimonial, S9\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Within the 21<sup>st</sup> century, many of our communication and interactions occur within online settings, such as email, social networking sites, and online gaming. Whilst these settings broaden the opportunities we have to connect with a range of people, they can bring a multitude of challenges to how we interact and understand one another. Research undertaken by Kaye at Edge Hill University from 2015 onwards has contributed a wide knowledge\-base to understand some issues relating to online communication and behaviour. Kaye’s expertise and leadership in cyberpsychology and track record in public and media engagement has enabled her research to inform and widen public understanding and debate on these critical new issues. Additionally, Kaye’s research has informed the activity of media organisations, behaviour change campaigns, social enterprises, including the development and evaluation of a mental health disclosure app, designed to support workplace well\-being. In 2020 Kaye acted as a representative of the British Psychological Society to formulate and present oral evidence to a major House of Lords Science and Technology Committee inquiry into the long\-term impacts of ‘living online’. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 All the work which underpins this case study commenced from 2015 onwards at Edge Hill University and fits into three themes detailed below. 

 **Making accurate first impressions online** 

 In 2015, a collaboration between Kaye, Wall \(Edge Hill University\) and Malone \(Griffith University\) was cemented. The team led research to explore issues such as how emoji reduce ambiguity in online communication \[1\], and how using certain emoji relate to user personality. The team developed the work, generating novel insights into the relationship with personality judgements \[2\]. This research revealed that emoji behaviour feeds into how we form first impressions online. Namely, using smiley emoji on social networking sites helps others to make accurate ratings of traits such as open\-mindedness. Developing from this, the team also conducted research to explore how other forms of online behaviour impact upon personality judgements. This has revealed that other personality traits such as; conscientiousness and extraversion can be accurately detected by people when viewing unacquainted others’ Facebook pages \[3, 4\]. As such, this work contributes to ongoing debate and awareness surrounding online first impressions and the extent to which these correspond to real\-world first impression formation. Accordingly, the findings present new insight that online behaviours can support more accurate judgement making of trait\-specific personality relative to face\-to\-face first impressions \(e.g., openness to experience is not a trait that is easy to accurately detect in face\-to\-face settings\). This therefore presents novel insight which contributes to the core areas of first impressions and judgement accuracy. Further, this work \[e.g., 2, 3, 4\] is underpinned theoretically by impression management theory \(Goffman, 1959\) and the work builds on core conceptual knowledge by applying how it relates to online forms of behaviour. Here, we have new evidence pertaining to how impression management efforts may differ online and how this impacts on the way we understand each other. 

 **Personalisation of online behaviour** 

 Kaye’s ongoing collaboration with Wall as an expert in personality psychology has created capacity to develop work to understand how individual differences of users can impact upon their online behaviour. This includes how online users’ personality traits relate to them using different types of emoji \[2\]. For example, those high in open\-mindedness tend to use a more diverse range of emoji. Also, how personality traits relate to different Facebook behaviours \[3\], such as extraversion often being related to the types of interactions users have online. Their work has also revealed that online language use feeds into different interpretations of others’ personality, particularly that of extraversion \[4\]. Finally, their more recent work highlights how there are variations in people’s susceptibility to persuasion based on their personality profile \[5\] which Kaye has recently discussed in relation to vulnerability to online scams, fake news, online trolling and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This contributes to the core area of “personality and individual differences” in psychology whereby insights are being applied to novel contexts and behaviours. 

 **Online communication and well\-being** 

 The final theme of Kaye’s research explores psychosocial outcomes associated with online technology. This work has related to digital gaming \(e.g., Kaye, Carlisle & Griffiths, 2019; Kaye, Kowert & Quinn, 2017\), open worlds \(Kleban & Kaye, 2015\) and most notably, online chat platforms \(Kaye & Quinn, 2020\). The latter of these, in output \[6\] illuminates the way WhatsApp facilitates varying types of social support and how these are related to factors such as social capital, collective identity, quality of relationships and in turn, aspects of positive well\-being. This work is situated in core theoretical debates about the role of technology in society and the extent to which time using technology displaces \(displacement hypothesis\) or stimulates \(stimulation hypothesis\) social interactions with others and functions for well\-being. Indeed, the work contributes to the latter of these, to present a nuanced insight into the specific support motivations for technology use and how these may be fundamental to understanding the range of impacts on individuals and society.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

#  Widening public understanding and debate of online behaviour 

 Kaye has a widely accessible public profile and is regularly invited as an expert commentator on many issues relating to social media, gaming and online behaviour. This in part is supported by her innovations in making her research insights open and accessible through Open Science Framework and in creative solutions such as visualisations and animations of research findings \(e.g., using the animation software Powtoon, hosting a YouTube channel\) and through her commitment to public engagement. This has enabled wide public access to academic knowledge and thus widened public understanding of the issues surrounding online behaviour. Her work on emoji within online communication has enjoyed substantial public and media interest in which the work \[largely output 2\] has been represented on a variety of popular media and news platforms. 

 Notably the work on “what your emoji says about you” \(insights primarily drawn from output 2\) has featured in a number of prominent public arenas. One includes The Conversation website which has received more than a 330k views since its publication in April 2016. Following this, this work \[output 2\] has also been featured on SciShow \(a popular Science YouTube channel\) which has been viewed 323,042 times to date. Additionally, this video generated a number of discussions within the comments section as viewers debated their own emoji use. Additionally, the news channel CNN produced a piece on this work for the health area of their news website, representing a global reach of the research. Finally, a combination of all media as well as academic engagements in this research also resulted in Kaye being invited to present her ideas at the prestigious TEDx conference series. Specifically, this took place on 21<sup>st</sup> October 2017 in the Vienna Voltstheater in front of a live audience of approximately 1000 delegates, concurrently with a global live stream. The recording of the talk currently has a YouTube view\-rate of nearly 4k views. Kaye’s attendance at the conference enabled a direct impact upon widening understanding of how we form first impressions online. 

 In addition to directly contributing to widely viewed media pieces Kaye’s research has been specifically reported on a by both the written media and new media demonstrating exceptionally high engagement on the topic.  For example, pieces on “zoom fatigue” have appeared in a number of sources including  [The Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/04/22/british-workers-suffering-online-meeting-fatigue-psychologists/) with an online reach of around 94 million readers annually, and in “PsychReg” which saw her  [blogpost](https://www.psychreg.org/zoom-fatigue/) reach 62,000 reads. 

 As a result of Kaye’s extensive media profile and wide public engagement work there are numerous examples where the research has resulted in public interaction and demonstrated widening of public understanding and offered opportunities up for new debates. As an example, a comment emanating from an a Youtube viewer of the TEDxTalk *“You wouldn't think something we might take for granted like using an Emoji can tell you something about a person's personality”* demonstrates previously large gaps in public understanding. 

 Further, when the YouTube link was shared on Twitter, user posts have indicated that the insights made people re\-think the use of emoji in online behaviour \(source 1\). For example, one user said: *“Great talk…Found it very interesting as an avid emoji user\! Definitely be contemplating my emoji use more carefully from now on…”* 

 Following extensive global media coverage into emoji use, the British Psychological Society \(BPS recognised the significance of Kaye’s work in this field and invited her to lead a number of public engagement events around the issue of the “psychology of emoji” \(informed by the research detailed here\). These were organised by the BPS’s regional branches who run “Psychology in the Pub” \(PitP\) events which are designed as outreach events for helping psychological evidence reach the public domain. These took place in March 2018 \(in York, organised by BPS North West branch\), April 2018 \(in Birmingham, organised by BPS West Midlands branch\) and May 2018 \(in Manchester, organised by the BPS North West branch\). Kaye developed a short quiz for the end of each talk via the platform “Kahoot” which allowed delegates to respond to multiple choice questions via their Smartphone, whereby they can indicate the extent of their learning from the event. This highlighted that after the events, from a total delegate attendance of around 80 people, 92.3% felt they now knew more about the psychology of emoji, and 76.9% reported that the talk had made them think at least a little bit more differently about their online behaviour \(Source 2\). 

 The work has penetrated wider public entertainment media too, as a blog written by the Presenter and Writer Danny Wallace about the use of emojis in communication. Prior to composing the blog, Wallace made contact with Kaye in October 2019 and gained insights about how different emoji feed into people’s perceptions of others. His blog piece “ [The <span style=""font-family: Wingdings"">&#xF04A;</span>is a Tiny Menace](https://forge.medium.com/the-is-a-tiny-yellow-menace-1d9689f3ab34)” cites Kaye strongly and links to her work, and also includes insights brought from the research. For example: “ *Linda Kaye is a cyberpsychologist….Kaye studies emoji because they’re actually useful in this digital age. As she has written, ‘\[I\]t turns out they may be serving a range of important psychological and social functions within human communication.’”* 

 The blog generated considerable interest, and among the reader responses, include evidence about how these insights have changed people’s understanding of their emoji use. For example, one reader commented: *“This had me laughing out loud at first… probably because this is my favourite emoji\! What does this say about me?\! I’m going to ponder this for the rest of my day.”* 

 Finally, between February and March 2020, Kaye was contacted by the BBC on two occasions to inform and contribute to educational media campaigns. The first was BBC Bitesize Education for a series of educational videos for 11\-16 year olds on detecting fake news. This involved Kaye offering expert advice on the influences behind fake news vulnerability \(such as those gained from output 5\) and practical advice to encourage self\-monitoring when interacting with online content. The second commission was from BBC Trending in which Kaye was asked to provide expert comments for a story on online trolling. This story consisted of a BBC journalist bringing together a troll and his target to understand the psychology behind trolling behaviour. Drawing on her work \(such as from output 5\), alongside her other work applying social identity theory to online settings \(e.g., Kaye, Carlisle & Griffiths, 2019; Kaye, Kowert & Quinn, 2017\), Kaye provided commentary to accompany the piece. This was featured on  [BBC World Service Trending](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csyvpb) and the lead journalist provided extensive Twitter coverage in the form of threads to document the story and associated input from Kaye \(Source 5\). 

#  Informing public and business behaviour change 

 In June 2019, the social team at Change Incorporated which is a media company owned by VICE Media Group, utilised Kaye’s research expertise to inform the design of an anti\-smoking emoji to be launched on World Emoji Day. Kaye’s involvement included input into the PR campaign to provide her expertise on why emoji should be an asset to the campaign strategy \(Source 3\). As a result of these discussions, Change Incorporated also developed a  [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=704154026694456) which was disseminated on the platform of Facebook which illustrated why emoji may be effective tools to support behaviour\-change campaigns around smoking cessation. 

 A further example is that Kaye’s expertise in cyberpsychology, resulted in her being invited as an expert consultant on a number of campaigns to reduce vulnerabilities in online worlds \(online scams, fake news and online trolling\). One was for Which? Magazine in their recent campaign surrounding online scams. Kaye was asked to review victim testimonials from a Bitcoin scam and give insight into the persuasive techniques utilised within this particular scam. This was well\-informed from her research work which has established the “personality of persuasion” \[5\], in which she has established how the principles of persuasion may operate in respect of victim susceptibility. These insights appeared alongside a large feature in the December 2019 issue of the magazine and also in supplementary  [video content](https://edgehill-my.sharepoint.com/boucheri/Downloads/My%20comments%20appeared%20alongside%20a%20large%20feature%20in%20the%20December%202019%20issue%20of%20this%20outlet%20and%20the%20accompanying%20video%20content%20online) on the online piece. A statement supplied by journalists at Which? Magazine the importance of this contribution; *“I believe Dr Kaye’s expert view has provided our readers with a powerful and important insight into the psychological pressure exerted by fraudsters. It is my hope that readers will be better placed to sport such tactics after reading Dr Kaye’s contribution”* \(Source 4\). They also make reference to the fact that the video content which Kaye contributed to had received almost 2000 views to date. Following this, Which? contacted Kaye again in July 2020 for an expert commentary on online bank scams in the context of Covid\-19. This was subsequently featured in the September 2020 issue of the magazine. 

 Based on Kaye’s expertise in cyberpsychology and associated work in output 5, in April 2020, the company “Trend Micro”, a global leader in cybersecurity solutions, contacted Kaye to request her collaboration in developing a campaign for the communications and marketing company WE Worldwide, around human\-based threats in the office, with regards to cybersecurity. Kaye’s involvement included developing a user questionnaire, interpreting the findings to develop cyber personas to help develop tailored cyber\-threat mitigation training, writing a white paper with key findings, and supporting post\-campaign dissemination. Of greatest relevance, Kaye’s expertise from output 5 on personality profiling ensured an evidence\-informed approach to interpreting the user findings which could support the development of a targeted campaign to mitigate human factors in cybersecurity. As well as being represented in a  [White Paper](https://resources.trendmicro.com/rs/945-CXD-062/images/TMHITCPersonaReport.pdf) \(“Persona Report”\- Source 6\), the findings of the work appeared across the national and international press \(e.g., Enterprise Times\- 38k readers\) as well as in trade press \(e.g., Business Wire\) in which Kaye was heavily cited: Kaye’s analysis and insights heavily influenced Trend Micro’s “ [Persona Report](https://resources.trendmicro.com/rs/945-CXD-062/images/TMHITCPersonaReport.pdf)” which outlines the various personality profiles of user and gives advice to IT leaders on cybersecurity support and training provision. 

 The work in output \[6\] led the Director of a social enterprise company “Inside Out”, to contact Kaye in the spring of 2020 to ask her to advise on the development of a mental health disclosure app “FormScore” \(publicly available on app stores “Inside Out” is an enterprise dedicated to supporting mental well\-being. This output formed the basis for an  [evidence review](https://www.formscore.today/articles/evidence-review) to inform the rationale for the app. Kaye subsequently became an Advisory Board member on the development of the FormScore app which is currently being piloted by many businesses to support employee well\-being. Within the  [Business Pilot](https://insideout4.typeform.com/to/H3kFPFh5), Kaye provided academic input and oversight on the evaluation of the work to provide scientific rigour in knowing whether intervention outcomes are attributable to the app. As of December 2020, several businesses had signed up to take part in a pilot, including the tech recruitment company “Austin Fraser”, the social enterprise organisation “Bring change to mind” as well as much international interest in the USA and Australia. Kaye’s input not only involved overseeing the academic integrity of the pilot, but also hosting, analysing, interpretating and disseminating the evaluation data for each organisation \(source 7\). Kaye’s involvement in the Business Pilot is therefore providing a strong evidence\-base to inform further development of the FormScore app and a large\-scale roll out internationally. Evaluation data from the initial business pilots suggests that those who have used the app have experienced significant improvements in some aspects of mental well\-being, indicating some promising outcomes for the efficacy of the app. Kaye’s contribution has been key to the success of the pilot as the CEO of InsideOut states *‘The research of Dr Kaye in this area was invaluable in helping validate the FormScore idea in that we are creating a direct means of connecting with others around our mental wellbeing.  This in turn was helpful for both the development team and gave comfort to investors.’* \(Source 8\). The app has been downloaded from app stores more than 1000 times to date and on average is being actively used daily on at least three\-quarters of unique devices. The Business Pilot of the FormApp is anticipated to reach over 20 businesses with over 50,000 users in the next 12 months across a number of territories and industries. 

#  Contribution to Parliamentary inquiry about mental health impacts of living online 

 Finally, in November 2020, Kaye was selected as the representative for the BPS in giving oral evidence to the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Lords as part of their response to their call for evidence about the long\-term impact of living online. The policy advisor to the BPS explains ‘ *Dr Kaye offered substantial evidence to help the BPS Policy Team develop a full consultation response… As a result, we contacted the Committee to recommend Dr Kaye based on her expertise in cyberpsychology could represent the BPS to give oral evidence’*. Kaye gave an opening address and evidence focusing on the mental health impacts of living online. Drawing on insights from output 6, she gave empirical evidence about the ways online communication can support well\-being, as well as wider critical considerations of the factors which determine how technology use relates to well\-being. This took place on 15<sup>th</sup> December 2020 to the House of Lords COVID\-19 Committee \(broadcast available  [here](https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/7ae97f19-36d1-4fff-8a2d-57e6eec4f8ba) as well as video summary message shared via Twitter  [here](https://twitter.com/HLCOVID19Com/status/1339232295589470210)\), and was in addition to the BPS’ response to this call in which Kaye coordinated a response on behalf of the Cyberpsychology Section \(Source 9\). Following this, a number of Kaye’s recommendations from the hearing were taken forward to the House of Commons, including how social technology companies may make better use of their platforms for encouraging good etiquette and regulatory behaviours and have ethical frameworks for data\-sharing \(Source 10\). ‘ *It is already the case that her expertise has contributed both to the written and oral evidence for this consultation, and that her recommendations given in the Committee session are being taken forward to the UK Government who will respond and implement as appropriate’ \(source 9\).*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The effectiveness and efficiency of university\-level mathematics teaching and the training of teachers and researchers was increased by new algorithms, data and software developed in St Andrews which enhanced the performance, mathematical scope and usability of software systems widely used in teaching.  This had an impact on courses given to at least 5,700 people \(students\) at least 27 institutions in 23 countries, as well as weekly on many of the 20,000 people \(users\) of the CoCalc web\-based  [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) and  [course management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) platform for  [computational mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mathematics). 

 Advanced mathematics, and mathematical topics in related disciplines, are an essential, but pedagogically challenging, part of Higher Education teaching in programmes of study ranging from pure mathematics through computer science to physics, chemistry and engineering. The use of software that automates routine calculations is an established technique in mathematics education at all levels. The software allows learners to “come to grips” with the concepts directly without becoming “bogged down” in technical details of calculation. The GAP system, which encapsulates our research, is widely used for this purpose, both directly and through other systems and online services that incorporate it. 

 The specific research results listed in section 2 extend GAP’s capabilities into new mathematical areas, which were the main topics of courses delivered to over 700 people \(students\), speed up critical aspects of the system allowing students to explore larger and more informative examples, add databases which are a valued source of examples for teaching, and link GAP to other systems providing a better experience for teachers and students. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research insights from the School of Computer Science can be loosely divided into four groups: 

 **1. Algorithms for semigroups:** St Andrews research on algorithms for semigroups enabled practically usable software for wide\-ranging computation in this important mathematical area. **Semigroups** are a key mathematical structure, used to describe sets of transformations of physical and abstract objects and the ways in which they combine. \[R1\] is a foundational paper in the area, which has led to at least 30 published research papers \(2000\-2018\) from St Andrews, 14 St Andrews PhD theses and 5 GAP extension packages with authors from St Andrews. 

 **2. New and faster algorithms for algebraic problems:** St Andrews research in algorithms for permutation groups and minimal polynomials sped up these calculations dramatically. **Permutation groups** are ubiquitous in mathematics, describing symmetries of objects and structures. Jefferson et al. \[R2\] developed, implemented and released a family of new algorithms for some central problems in the area, outperforming the best existing implementations massively in some cases. On one test suite in \[R2\], it completed three times as many examples as the previous state of the art, in one\-fifth of the time. These algorithms are widely used “behind the scenes” in mathematical software systems, so improving them speeds up user calculations in areas such as matrix groups, combinatorics and semigroups, not just those directly involving permutation groups. Computing **minimal polynomials** is a similarly fundamental problem for matrices. In 2008, Neunhöffer and Praeger \(Western Australia\) developed \[R3\] and implemented a new efficient algorithm, up to 200 times faster on difficult cases from real\-world problems \(examples in \[R3\]\). This algorithm speeds up many common computations used in areas such as error\-correcting codes and cryptography as well purely mathematical applications. 

 **3. New Classification Results:** St Andrews researchers led by Kelsey in 2012 classified all **the 12,418,001,077,381,302,684 non\-equivalent semigroups** of order 10 and constructed a searchable library of the 1,843,973,431 of orders up to 8 \[R4\]. Roney\-Dougal extended the classification of **all primitive permutation groups** from degree 1000 to degree 4095, adding 16,692 new groups \[R5\]. Permutation groups are ubiquitous mathematical objects, describing ways in which a collection can be reordered while preserving some property, and primitive permutation groups are foundational ones from which all others are built. 

 **4. Linking Mathematical Software Systems Together:** St Andrews researchers \(with collaborators\) developed new approaches to linking mathematical software systems to each other and to associated tools such as modern user interfaces. Doing this, without compromising speed of computation or correctness of results, is a challenging and long\-standing problem. St Andrews researchers made major progress on this problem in two European projects: SCIEnce \(2006\-2011\) and OpenDreamKit \(2015\-2019\) \[R6\]. Our research has made major contributions to efficient, mathematically correct and reliable links between diverse mathematical systems and popular user interface tools, such as the Jupyter Notebook system. 

 These results form part of a much larger body of ongoing research in algorithms, systems and applications around computational algebra, hosted since 2000 in an interdisciplinary research centre \(CIRCA – the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra\) which bridges the University’s School of Mathematics and Statistics and the School of Computer Science. One pillar of that research is our ongoing role as a major centre for the development of the GAP \(Groups, Algorithms, Programming\) system described below. Twenty\-five St Andrews researchers have contributed directly to the project, publishing 34 journal and conference papers featuring improved algorithms or system features incorporated in GAP.

 **4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\).** 

 By adding new capabilities for computing with semigroups, new and faster algorithms for key problems, new databases and new links to other systems, our research insights have enhanced software widely used in teaching and learning of advanced mathematics. Through this, our research has changed the practices of advanced mathematics teaching at more than 27 institutions in 23 countries, affecting courses taken by over 5,700 people \(students\), improving the students' learning and understanding.  Specifically, more teachers are using computational algebra software to teach advanced mathematics, enabling them to make their courses more investigative and student\-centred, leading to improved learning and understanding in their students. Our research has also improved the experience, learning and understanding of the approximately 20,000 weekly users of the CoCalc web\-based  [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) and  [course management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) platform for  [computational mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mathematics). 

 **Pathway from Research to Impact** 

 The pathway from our research to this impact runs through an open\-source software system called  [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) \(Groups, Algorithms, Programming\) \[S1\]. GAP is a software package which allows the user to calculate interactively with complex mathematical objects, such as groups, semigroups, permutations, matrices and so on. It is highly extensible and, with appropriate extension packages, has functionality covering much of abstract algebra, combinatorics, representation theory and other key disciplines in pure mathematics. Our research insights are realised as algorithms, databases and software technologies, which are distributed as part of GAP, which is itself used for teaching. 

 Our development of new algorithms for computing with semigroups has expanded GAPs capabilities in semigroup theory from almost nothing, making it possible to use GAP for teaching \(as well as researching\) this key topic. As one measure of the scale of this expansion, since 2012 \(the oldest version available, but already including some of our work\) the number of documentation entries containing “semigroup” in their names increased from 700 to over 2,000 \[S2\]. This expanded capability provided the basis for subsequent changes in teaching practice and student learning. 

 Our new algorithms for permutation groups and linear algebra increased the speed of key computations across the whole system. This allows students to work flexibly and interactively with more and larger examples of the mathematical objects they are studying. This is especially important as the smallest examples in these fields \(the only ones accessible to hand computation or with previous generations of software\) are often atypical and can mislead students. A professor of mathematics at Colorado State University \(Fort Collins\) emphasised this in his letter, writing "" *The use of computation makes it feasible to \[study examples\] in cases that are significantly larger than what could be done by hand, and allows \[students\] to study not only individual phenomena, but also to avoid misguided intuition, based on the availability of only small examples*"" \[S3, p. 5\]. A professor of algebra from the University of Granada wrote, "" *fast and responsive performance benefits their educational use, for example by allowing students to experiment with larger examples gaining deeper understanding*"" \[S3, p. 4\]. 

 Adding databases to the system builds still further on the ability of students to work with examples, allowing them to systematically study all examples and to look for patterns. It also increases the efficiency of teaching by making it trivial for the teacher to identify and supply examples for the students. A lecturer at Vrije Universiteit, Brussels, wrote "" *Through the study of examples using the databases available in GAP... a natural approach to the formulation of general theorems can be developed.""* \[S3, p. 6\]. 

 Finally, thanks to our research on linking mathematical software, GAP is now also part of the broader SageMath mathematics software system \[S4\] and the CoCalc on\-line scientific collaboration and teaching system \[S5\], enabling thousands of additional students to benefit from its capabilities. As a direct output of our research \[R6\], GAP can now be used though the Jupyter notebook user interface, which many students and teachers are familiar with from the popular Python programming language and which is widely used in data science and scientific data analysis. 

 **Reach of Impact** 

 Both GAP and SageMath are open\-source software systems, which anyone is free to download and use, without informing the authors. Evidence for the reach of the impact through their direct use is thus unavoidably incomplete, based on surveys, requests for support and publications. Our most recent survey of the use of GAP, SageMath and CoCalc in teaching \[S6\] received 46 responses between 22 September 2020 and 01 December 2020, describing teaching in 23 countries to a total of 5,757 people \(students\) between August 2013 and December 2020. Of particular note are courses delivered to over 2,500 people \(students\) in at least seven African countries. Teaching included undergraduate \(26 reports\), postgraduate \(26 reports\) and professional development courses \(10 reports\). Among these are 740 people \(students\) taking computer supported courses in semigroup theory, something that would have been impossible without our research. Earlier data collections through the GAP website \[S7\] and GitHub \[S8\] definitively identify 7 additional sites, in 7 additional countries where GAP has been used in teaching between August 2013 and December 2020. 

 GAP and SageMath are key components of the CoCalc online service \[S5\] which provides additional tools for teaching, course management, assessment, etc. As of February 2020, CoCalc had over 20,000 unique weekly logins, growing at about 20% per year \[S9\]. 

 **Significance of impact** 

 Evidence for the significance of the specific changes flowing from our insights is found in our survey \[S6\]. As well as the 740 students whose semigroup theory courses would simply have been impossible without our algorithms and software, 88% of responses agreed that the ability to explore larger examples was an important or very important benefit of using the systems, and 72% said that the performance and responsiveness of the software was a significant factor in delivering the benefits of the software for their teaching. These benefits flow from our new and faster algorithms. Mathematical databases were rated “very” or “extremely” important by 50%. The significance of our work on linking software is seen in the extent of use of GAP via SageMath and CoCalc \(52% of those who responded to our survey use it this way, and we know \[S9\] that the majority of CoCalc users use SageMath\). 

 Evidence of widespread use and high value placed on computational tools for teaching in this area is found in the publication by independent authors, of textbooks for courses relying on the use of GAP and SageMath.  We know of 8 editions of textbooks published between August 2013 and December 2020 which rely on GAP \[S7\] and 24 which rely on SageMath \[S10\]. In France, SageMath \(under its previous name “Sage”\) is on the national list of software permitted for the “Aggregation”, the qualifying examination for secondary school teachers \[S11\]. 

 A pedagogical research project in 2018 at the Universitat d’Alacant and Universitat Politècnica  de València studied the use of GAP in courses on Group Theory and Coding Theory. It reported a positive experience and included a recommendation that the University "" *Integrate GAP classes into the subject from the beginning, thus giving time to ... see more examples and applications of the program*"" \[S12, p. 8, our translation\]. 

 Further evidence is found in the letters \[S3\] submitted as part of the follow\-up to the survey: 

 ""*I have made the experience that by giving the students the possibility to work concretely with the new algebraic objects they have seen in the courses the motivation to confront abstract algebraic problems hugely increases. .....* 

 *The interplay of theory with the calculations of more complex examples, for which manual computations are overly technical or simply not feasible, allows a much deeper insight into the underlying algebra*."" \[S3, p. 6\] 

 *“ … the possibility of using structures as groups, rings and fields either finite or infinite allows the student to implement cryptographic protocols in platforms which the students could not construct themselves in a computer without an extraordinary effort.”* \[S3, p. 3\] *\(*describing teaching a cryptography course\). 

 ""*The combination of Sagemath with Jupyterlab is a useful tool that makes possible to combine GAP with other mathematical tools, for both the use of students \(for teamwork and labs\) and for the use of teachers in the class room. It offers a learning by experimentation which would be hardly achieved without these tools. ..... the inclusion of GAP in Sagemath has allowed to interact groups with other mathematical objects* "" \[S3, p. 2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from the University of Oxford’s Department of Surgical Sciences and Department of Engineering \(UOA12\) led to the development of the OrganOx metra – the world’s first normothermic organ preservation device, used to improve and prolong preservation and function of livers prior to transplantation. The research was commercialised through the formation of the spin out company OrganOx and resulted in over GBP7,000,000 of direct sales since product CE marking in 2016. Based on the evidence produced by a 220\-patient randomised clinical trial published as a cover story in Nature in 2018, normothermic machine perfusion was endorsed by NICE in January 2019. By 2020, the OrganOx metra was deployed and routinely used in all seven UK liver transplant centres and has been used to perform over 850 liver transplants across 13 countries. Improved organ preservation halves the number of discarded organs, and improves waiting times and clinical outcomes for patients. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the development of the world’s first normothermic liver perfusion device took place as a close cross\-disciplinary collaboration at the University of Oxford between surgeon Professor Peter Friend and engineer Professor Constantin Coussios \(University of Oxford, UOA12\). The team improved preservation and organ utilisation by replicating, in a robust, automated fashion, the physiological conditions encountered by the organ within the body, through perfusion of the organ at a warm, normothermic, physiological temperature of 37°C with a red\-cell suspension reconstituted from donor blood of the same blood type. Professor Friend led the surgical usability aspects of the device, the in vivo work and clinical trials. Professor Coussios led the engineering, specifically the haemolysis minimisation, controller design and perfusion automation. 

 The technology was developed using pig livers, the standard pre\-clinical model for organ preservation studies. The team’s initial perfusion studies confirmed that warm perfusion is superior to cold for the release of liver transaminase, bile production and protein synthesis after transplantation \[1\]. Having demonstrated warm perfusion was superior for liver function, they went on to confirm that minimising exposure to cooling was not just preferable but necessary for increased utilisation of donor livers \[2\]. 

 The initial perfusion studies were translated into a pig liver transplant model \[3\], which further confirmed the advantages of warm perfusion, enabling successful liver transplantation under conditions of prolonged preservation of 20 hours. When the team combined this with clinically\-relevant pre\-preservation hypoxia it provided a model of organ retrieval following death confirmed by circulatory, rather than neurological, parameters. The team completed successful transplantation after very prolonged preservations of 48 hours. This evidenced the technology’s potential for improved utilisation of livers that are currently not retrieved or retrieved and not transplanted \[4\]. 

 Building on this proof of concept, OrganOx Ltd was founded as a University of Oxford spin\-out in 2008 to design, build and test the device for a Phase I trial to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of warm liver preservation in a clinical setting. The first clinical use of warm liver preservation took place in February 2013 in a study involving 20 patients. The team demonstrated safety \(100% graft and patient survival at 30 days\) and a 50% reduction in an acute liver injury. This research \[5\] was published as a cover article in the American Journal of Transplantation and later judged as the journal’s ‘best clinical paper’ of 2016. 

 A 220\-patient randomised trial comparing warm to cold preservation across seven European transplant centres was initiated in 2015, completed in 2017 and published in 2018 as a cover article in Nature \[ **6**\]. This first large randomised trial in liver preservation demonstrated that use of the normothermic device resulted in a 50% decrease in organ discard rate and a 50% increase in preservation time, whilst at the same time results in a 50% decrease in post\-transplant graft injury. During the trial, clinicians began to use machine flow parameters and biochemistry to determine whether to transplant livers of marginal quality.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Liver transplantation is a highly effective treatment for end\-stage liver failure, but is heavily constrained by the limited pool of donor organs. In the UK in the year to March 2018, there were 1,574 deceased donors, 1,149 liver retrievals and 975 liver transplants, indicating 62% overall liver utilisation. The highest\-risk donor organs, including from donors after circulatory death rather than donors after brain death, were particularly poorly utilised \(34%\). As a result of this under\-utilisation, in 2018 some 30% of listed patients were still waiting for a transplant for six months after listing, and 12% of listed patients died whilst still on the waiting list within two years \[A\] **.** 

####  Regulatory approval, endorsement by NICE, and uptake of OrganOx metra 

 The research undertaken by Friend demonstrated the potential to increase the number of livers available for transplantation through increased utilisation of donor livers by warm perfusion, and the collaboration with Coussios made this technically possible through the development of the OrganOx metra. The first patient to benefit from this new approach was successfully transplanted in February 2013, and following successful completion of this Phase I study \[5\] the OrganOx metra received its CE mark as a medical device in 2016. Based on evidence from \[6\], machine perfusion was endorsed by NICE in January 2019 \[B\]. By December 2020, the OrganOx *metra* was being used routinely across all seven UK transplant centres in the UK \(Birmingham, Cambridge, King’s, Leeds, Edinburgh, Royal Free and Newcastle\). It total it has been used to enable over 850 liver transplants in 4 continents and 13 countries \(UK, Austria, Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, India, UAE, Australia, Canada, and USA\) \[C\]. 

####  Benefit to patients 

 The OrganOx metra has significant benefits for both liver transplant recipients and patients with end stage liver disease who are awaiting a liver transplant. Improved patient outcomes are due to a reduction in damage to the perfused liver after it has been removed from the donor, and the ability to assess the donated liver’s function before it is transplanted, which result in more livers available for transplantation by using organs which would previously have been discarded. By increasing how long the liver can be stored before a transplant, clinicians can also choose to undertake a transplant at the optimal time point. 

 In the large randomised trial \[6\], the Oxford team halved the organ discard rate from 24% to 12%. Even though more organs \(including more marginal organs\) were utilised and were preserved for 50% longer, the post\-transplant outcomes were still significantly better for normothermically preserved organs, as evidenced by a 50% decrease in post\-transplant graft injury. The Professor of Transplantation at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, the first UK centre to fully adopt the OrganOx metra for routine clinical use, confirmed in October 2020: 

 “*Since its introduction into our routine clinical practice in February 2018 we have increasingly used the machine in three settings, to assess donor livers where doubt existed over viability, to enable us to tackle difficult recipient procedures without the pressure of accumulating cold ischaemia, and to overcome logistical issues such as where we accepted two livers simultaneously. By far the biggest use \(70%\) has been in the assessment of donor livers. Since we started using the normothermic liver perfusion our transplant activity has increased around 30%...As you would imagine this has had an impact on our waiting times and waiting list mortality, as well as enabling us to successfully use livers that would otherwise not have been used by any centre in the UK*.” \[D\] 

 NICE issued a press release in January 2019 announcing their recommendation of the procedure and highlighting the benefits to patients: 

 *“Every year hundreds of people with advanced liver disease die whilst waiting for a transplant. This new device offers real hope as it may improve transplant outcomes and allow livers that were previously thought to be unsuitable to be used and also increase the time that livers are able to be kept. It is an exciting development that has the potential to shorten waiting list times and reduce mortality rates from advanced liver disease. After transplant, the vast majority of people go on to lead full and healthy lives and it is truly amazing to see the transformation.”* Director of Policy at the British Liver Trust \[E\]. 

####  Changes to clinical practice 

 In addition to increasing donated organ utilisation, the introduction of the OrganOx metra in to the seven UK transplant centres has had a significant impact on clinical practice in the field of liver transplantation. An independent study \(VITTAL: Viability Testing and Transplantation of Marginal Livers, NCT02740608\), led by the University of Birmingham between November 2016 – February 2018, investigated the impact of normothermic machine perfusion on utilisation of liver grafts that had been discarded by all seven liver transplant centres in the UK. Of the 31 liver grafts perfused on the OrganOx metra, 22 were subsequently transplanted with 100% 90\-day survival, demonstrating that normothermic machine perfusion can enable safe utilisation of over 70% of presently discarded grafts \[F\]. Chief Investigator of the VITTAL study, transplant surgeon at University Hospital's Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said: 

 “*In the 30 years I've been involved with transplantation, there have been three or four events which have been game changers and I'm absolutely certain we are looking at a game changer that will change the way we practice organ storage and transplantation. It is already changing practice at the centres that have been able to use this technology either within clinical trials or within an expansion of service evaluation*” \[E\]. 

 The OrganOx metra has also had a significant impact on transplantation logistics. By increasing preservation times from the conventional maximum of 12 hours to well over 30 hours \[G\], clinicians have more flexibility about the timing of surgery and are able to plan more transplants as day cases, as noted in \[6\]. A study on the introduction of normothermic machine perfusion \(NMP\) at the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria, found that *“NMP in a multidisciplinary approach enables a safe prolongation of liver preservation and overnight organ care. A first field test of NMP indicates safety and benefit of this approach”* \[G\]. This experience led to the omission of night\-time procedures and parallel transplantations in Innsbruck \[G\]. In a separate study, use of the OrganOx metra device allowed 84% of transplants to take place during the day versus 65% with static cold storage \[H\]. This may help transplant surgical teams avoid ‘burn\-out’ of key personnel. There is good evidence that daytime operations also have better outcomes for patients; for example, Yang et al \[I\] found that after\-hours surgery was associated with significantly increased postoperative mortality and morbidity, and that: “ *The timing of surgery plays a role in the outcome after the procedure and that both mortality and morbidities increase in surgeries performed outside of the regular working hours*”. 

 A UK health economic study conducted by the University of Southampton in 2019 \[J\] concluded that, even though normothermic machine perfusion is more costly than static cold storage, it is also significantly more cost\-effective by virtue of enabling additional transplants, with patients experiencing lower rates of early allograft dysfunction and adverse events: its incremental cost\-effectiveness ratio was found to be GBP7,876 per Quality\-Adjusted Life Year \(QALY\) gained. 

####  Economic Impact 

 In the first three years since CE marking in 2016, the OrganOx metra has seen over GBP7,000,000 of cumulative direct sales since product CE marking in 2016. As of October 2020, the company employs 29 staff \(headcount\): 23 in the UK, 4 in the US, 1 based in France and 1 based in Germany. Revenue for the period 1st May 2019 – 30th April 2020 was GBP2,200,000 which represents a 30% increase in revenue from the previous year \[ **C**\]. 40 devices are in use worldwide across Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. In January 2020, the company received a GBP4,600,000 investment from BGF, a UK investment company, to enable expansion in the US, where a subsidiary has been incorporated \[C\]. 

####  Recognition 

 The OrganOx metra was recognised in the 2013 IET Innovation Awards, receiving 1<sup>st</sup> prize in 3 of 15 categories, including: ‘Best Healthcare Technology’, ‘Best Intelligent System’ and ‘Best Emerging Technology Design’. The OrganOx metra was further shortlisted as one of 4 finalists for the 2019 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary MacRobert award of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In September 2019, OrganOx won the ‘Best Proof\-of\-Value of an Innovation’ category at the US Medtech Insight Awards in Boston, attracting the following citation: 

 *“This is a major advancement in organ preservation. There is well\-documented unmet medical need in this area, and it is a true achievement to have a method to help secure desperately needed organs for patients. The judges commented that OrganOx represents the true aspects of what it takes to be best value and best for patients. The need for better preservation for transported organs has been a true roadblock for patients desperately waiting for organ transplants. The perseverance of the team is obvious, and they overcame huge roadblocks to achieve success.”* \[K\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Movement is so fundamental to our existence that we tend only to notice exceptional cases, either when movement is dysfunctional—as in the pathologies that result from stroke and typify Parkinson’s disease, or when it seems perfect—in the elite performance of sports stars and artists. The QUB Perception and Action group use state\-of\-the\-art technology—virtual reality, motion capture, and neuroimaging—to understand sensorimotor skills in these exceptional cases and develop new interventions to improve functional capability. The SMART Arm device alleviates the impairments of stroke survivors \(commercialized through SMART Arm Pty. Ltd.\); dance\-based interventions aid Parkinson’s sufferers. Elite training strategies in football, rugby and cricket proposed by the group have interested many professional organizations, resulting in several collaborations \(e.g., Ulster Rugby\) and Prof. Craig went on to found the company INCISIV based on her research. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impact of QUB’s Perception and Action group is derived from theoretical understanding and practical knowledge of motor control and learning, multisensory integration, and the neural mechanisms underpinning movement. The team has a unique combination of disciplinary backgrounds and expertise in the use of diverse but complementary state\-of\-the\-art measurement systems and analytical tools. The interventions they have developed target two key contexts, clinical rehabilitation \(for stroke and Parkinson’s disease\) and elite sports and performance \(football and rugby\). 

 **Improving movement for clinical rehabilitation** 

 *Stroke Rehabilitation*: It is widely recognised that participation in intensive and repetitive task\-oriented training promotes recovery of upper limb function after stroke. The key problem addressed by Richard Carson’s research is that the severe muscle weakness \(paresis\) suffered by many stroke survivors prevents task\-oriented training. Carson and colleagues in Australia developed the SMART \(SensoriMotor Active Rehabilitation Training\) Arm device to allow stroke survivors to engage in intensive and repetitive reaching practice. The research concerns the exploitation of neural plasticity in motor relearning—the means by which the brain can adapt and compensate for injuries—and optimising rehabilitation therapy in hospital and community settings. The SMART Arm is designed to make task\-oriented, independent practice possible for stroke survivors with severe paresis. Randomised clinical control trials with chronic and acute stroke survivors have established its efficacy, showing the recovery of functional capacity **\[R1\]**. Hayward et al. \(2017 **\)\[R2\]** substantiated the neural mechanisms that mediate the positive outcomes of SMART Arm assisted training. This research exploited adjuvant techniques such as functional electrical stimulation \(FES\), and employed non\-invasive brain stimulation and imaging of structural brain connectivity, to ensure that the clinical deployment is based on evidence of both neural and behavioural adaptation. 

 *Parkinson’s disease*: Cathy Craig, Matthew Rodger and Mihalis Doumas have assessed movement control in Parkinson’s disease at QUB for 10 years. They showed that ecologically valid sounds improve gait in people suffering from the neurodegenerative condition better than more typical metronome cueing devices **\[R3, R4\]**. Current work builds on this to investigate effects of Dance for PD®—a well\-established programme of dance classes specifically designed for people with Parkinson’s—on motor symptoms such as disordered gait and non\-motor quality\-of\-life symptoms. 

 **Improving movement for elite sports** 

 Joost Dessing and Cathy Craig \(now CEO at INCISIV\) led the movement for elite sports research using custom virtual reality\-based simulators for various sports, such as football, rugby and cricket. A key line of investigation focuses on the performance of goalkeepers in football during free kick scenarios. The group has used their virtual reality\-based goalkeeping simulator to address many scientific and practical questions. The research showed that when a defending wall obstructs the goalkeeper’s vision in free kick scenarios it negatively affects the goalkeeper’s performance. This result should motivate goalkeepers and trainers to critically evaluate the balance between benefits and downsides of placing the wall—possibly with the aid of a virtual reality goalkeeping simulator—and consider omitting it in extreme cases **\[R5\].** Another line of investigation focused on how attacking rugby players perceive opportunities–passable gaps between defenders–and how defending rugby players perceive or are tricked by deceptive passing movements of attackers **\[R6\].**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Clinical stroke rehabilitation impact** 

 *Stroke rehabilitation – SMART Arm* 

 80% of stroke survivors lose arm and hand function, a long term issue for 60%. Over 50% of stroke survivors depend on others for everyday activities \(Royal College of Physicians National Sentinel Stroke Clinical Audit, 2010\). Informal care costs alone were estimated at EUR15,900,000,000 billion or 35% of the total EU stroke costs in 2015. Productivity losses were estimated to be EUR5,400,000,000 billion \(The Burden of Stroke in Europe Report\). Healthcare systems have limited human personnel capacity to address this burden and stroke survivors often have insufficient residual function for independent practice. 

 The SMART Arm actively engages stroke survivors to re\-learn stroke compromised arm and hand movements. Active engagement is required to capitalise on the adaptive neural plasticity of the brain to restore everyday action abilities and reinstate independent living. 

 SMART Arm Pty Ltd launched in July 2012 to further develop, manufacture and market the technology. A provisional patent for the invention was filed in September 2016. Pre\-commercial prototypes have been in use for several years in two clinical stroke units located in Queensland, Australia **\[C1\]**. NeuroMotion Pty Ltd are acquiring the rights to the SMART Arm product to complete 31\-03\-21 with a goal of the device to be market ready by June 2023. While the economic impact is in progress, the SMART Arm has had extensive impact in clinical training for stroke rehabilitation. Carr and Shepherd included the device in their widely used text ‘Neurological Rehabilitation: Optimising Motor Performance’, compulsory in all Australian Physiotherapy programs and Departments of Rehabilitation, and in many other countries **\[C2\]**. Also, the SMART Arm is covered extensively—embedded video, photographs, and illustrations of clinical outcomes—in Kleim \(2012\) Neural plasticity: foundations for neurorehabilitation **\[C3\]** *.* 

 **Parkinson’s Disease, Auditory cues and Dance** 

 QUB research established that action\-relevant sound cues improve movement and gait in people with Parkinson’s disease, and demonstrated how musical sounds can guide and enhance movement in general **\[C4\]**. The positive links between sound and movement skills led to the development and testing of a series of dance\-based interventions to improve movement and well\-being in people with Parkinson’s disease. The Dance for PD® interventions are co\-designed with people with Parkinson’s in the local community funded by an involvement award from Parkinson’s UK, Thouron award and a Fulbright scholarship. From September 2018 the first weekly Dance for PD® classes started in Northern Ireland. Ten to fifteen people with Parkinson’s disease participate in each class with over forty participants taking part in these interventions. The dance programme is tailored to the needs of people with Parkinson’s in the local community \(see video for details\) with immediate impact for the participants based both on their impressions of the programme, for example one Parkinson’s participant stated that the dance intervention was *“…a revelation… the mobility was beginning to reappear, and the flexibility was certainly more pronounced than it had been…”* **\[C5, C6\]** *.* Long term and global impact comes from the scientific assessment of the efficacy of Dance for PD as an intervention programme for improving motor, non\-motor symptoms and quality of life for people suffering from Parkinson’s disease. 

 **Improving movement in elite sports** 

 QUB’s Movement Innovation lab has been a key facility in sports research—football, rugby and cricket players have participated to understand their perceptual and motor capabilities. A long\-term relationship with Ulster Rugby has allowed impact by contributing to science\-based training instructions **\[C7\].** In addition, several movement games were designed for the Ulster Rugby Nevin Spence Interpretive Centre motivating public interest in STEM in sport. These games allow the public to interact with science\-driven content and engage young people in STEM subjects. 

 Work with English Cricket Board captured in the Sky Sports documentary MindGames \(Episode 4 16.35\) allowed virtual practice in real world stadiums such as a virtual reality recreation of Lord’s cricket ground **\[C8\]**. 

 In football, Joost Dessing’s and Cathy Craig’s virtual reality goalkeeping research has questioned commonly held views on the use of “the wall” in free kicks. This has led to extensive media attention **\[C9\]** and generated interest from many organizations \(e.g., Royal Dutch Football Association, NI Goalkeeping Academy, Larne FC \[both Northern Ireland\]\), already resulting in collaborations \(and NI Goalkeeping Academy, Larne FC \[both Northern Ireland\]\). Future training strategies suggested by this research can involve virtual reality tools, such as those marketed by Cathy Craig’s company INCISIV. INCISIV is a sports analytics start\-up company founded by Cathy Craig that aims to improve movement decision\-making in professional sports people \[C10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Søren Holm’s research on infectious disease control, the ethics of human challenge studies and his critiques of ageing in bioethics have directly shaped COVID\-19 vaccination policy and practice in Norway, Denmark and England. Informed by his foundational research on the need to develop evidence\-based bioethics, his work has produced substantial health benefits to populations at increased risk of death from COVID\-19. His input to the COVID\-19 vaccination prioritisation policies of Norway and Denmark resulted in the recognition of older people as deserving highest priority for vaccination. Through his expert appointment by the English Health Research Authority his research was used to \(i\) develop training which enabled members of a newly constituted Research Ethics Committee to review human challenge studies and \(ii\) to devise an assessment tool that was applied by the human challenge REC members in appraising and then approving the first, and only, COVID\-19 human challenge study. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Holm’s research underpinning this impact case study draws together three strands of work: \(a\) public health ethics and infectious diseases; \(b\) reframing the way that older people are accounted for in mainstream bioethical research; and \(c\) translating bioethical inquiry into health policy. 

 **\(a\) Public Health Ethics and Infectious Disease** 

 Holm’s research has addressed the obligations that states have to citizens when implementing public health measures during infectious disease outbreaks. Specifically, he has examined the question of if and when a State has an obligation to compensate those citizens who are burdened or harmed by public health interventions \[1\] and has concluded that wide\-ranging obligations to compensate for burden and harm can be justified, based on ethical theory and more pragmatic considerations in respect of ensuring adherence to the public health measures. The most recent output from this line of research \[1\] was developed at an invited workshop at the Brocher Foundation organised by Monash University. 

 Challenge studies raise particular ethical issues because they involve infecting healthy volunteers with the disease\-causing agent with the sole purpose of generating knowledge. Holm’s work on the research ethics of COVID\-19 challenge studies \[2,3\] was undertaken specifically to contribute to a fast\-moving academic and public discussion questioning the ethicality of undertaking such studies and whether or not they should be approved by research regulators, and subsequently conducted. Holm’s research showed that challenge studies are difficult to reconcile with medical research ethics as developed since the Second World War \[2\] and that even if there might be a context in which such studies are conceivably justifiable, the conditions under which this could happen will not be met in practice \[3\]. 

 **\(b\) Reframing Ageing in Contemporary Bioethics** 

 Holm’s research challenges the way in which ageing and the old are represented in contemporary bioethics. His analysis of mainstream bioethical literature \[4\] showed that 1\) the paradigmatic example of ‘the person’ or the individual in bioethical analysis is the young \(male\) adult, 2\) when the old are considered it is within a framing of a narrative of inevitable decay, and 3\) that 1&2 combined leads to a devaluation of the old and their interests in bioethical argument. This framing of ageing is also prevalent in health economics and health policy. Holm’s research challenges this dominant framing and its consequences and advances an alternative set of claims as to how older people’s interests and their contributions can be properly recognised, including the claim that the elderly and their lives count in themselves and not just as \(sub\-optimal\) producers of life years or QALYs. \[5\]. This work has contributed foundational conceptual bioethics analysis to projects analysing the many different practical ethical issues and policy choices actualised in health care for the old. This research was advanced through an international collaboration \(with Professor Inéz de Beaufort and Professor Martje Schermer, Erasmus University, Rotterdam; and Dr Mark Schweda, Göttingen University\). 

 **\(c\) Translating Bioethical Inquiry into Health Policy** 

 Drawing on his experience as a member of two national ethics bodies \(the Danish Council of Ethics and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics\), Holm undertook an analysis of the issues arising when translating bioethical inquiry and bioethical ‘research results’ into health policy and the importance of different kinds of evidence pertaining to such translation. The work began with output \[6\], produced in the course of the EU funded project *Empirical Methods in Bioethics* \(i\), which Holm co\-ordinated as the principal investigator \(PI\). This project was the first large\-scale project globally to investigate the importance of empirical data in bioethical argument and it prefigured what became labelled in the literature as ‘the empirical turn’ in bioethics.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Holm’s research on empirical bioethics \[6\] has enabled him to articulate policy\-relevant evidence and arguments and make these available in a way that is understandable and persuasive to policy\-makers. The success of this work on empirical ethics and policy making underpins two key strands of impact relating to COVID\-19 vaccination policy and practice. First, Holm’s research has had a direct bearing on two national vaccination prioritisation policies in Scandinavia and the communication of their credibility to the general public and key stakeholders. This contribution is highly significant, since Norway and Denmark are acknowledged as two of only 10 European States which have adopted an overtly ethical basis for national vaccination prioritisation policy \[A\]. Second, it has contributed to the training of members of a dedicated Research Ethics Committee \(REC\) in England, and the development of key analytical tools used by that Committee to appraise the world’s first COVID\-19 human challenge trial. 

 **1. Shaping COVID\-19 Vaccination Policy in Scandinavia** 

 **Norway** 

 In 2020 The Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services commissioned the Norwegian Institute of Public Health to prepare a national immunisation plan which included preparing, implementing and following up vaccination against COVID\-19. As part of the assignment, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health was charged with developing recommendations to prioritise groups for vaccination. The Institute appointed an expert group for ethics and prioritisation, comprising six members with expertise in health resource prioritisation. Holm was the only non\-Norwegian expert member of the group and was appointed because of his research and expertise in public health ethics \[B\], not least his previous research on the obligations that states have to citizens when implementing public health measures \[B\]. 

 The group published its report on 17 November 2020 \[C\]. It recommended that the values of equal respect, welfare, equity, trust and legitimacy ought to underpin the policy on prioritisation. The group then agreed a descending ranking of key goals pertaining to a future policy: 1\) reduction of the risk of death; 2\) reduction of the risk of severe illness; 3\) maintenance of essential services and critical infrastructure; 4\) protection of employment and the economy; 5\) re\-opening society. Finally, the group advocated that any strategy and prioritisation order be adjusted in light of shifts in the course of the pandemic; the properties of vaccines; and the infection rates within Norway. The report recommended that people over the age of 65 and people with underlying health conditions be deemed the highest priority groups for vaccination. It also recommended that second priority status should be given to healthcare workers, subject to review in the event of a significant rise in infection rates. 

 Holm played a central role in the development of these recommendations. In particular, his claims about how older people’s interests should be properly recognised \[4,5\] influenced the decision of the panel to confer highest priority on older and more vulnerable people, rather than younger groups of critical workers. The underlying basis of this decision is affirmed by Dr Japser Litmann, Deputy Director of the Coronavirus Immunisation Programme in Norway. He observes that Holm’s arguments on the moral worth of older people *“persuaded panel members to depart from the Norwegian Government’s standard approach of focussing exclusively on the number of life years saved as the key driver for prioritisation, rather than lives saved”* \[B\]. As a result of this intervention, the panel ultimately noted: 

 *The ethics advisory group believes that the distribution of limited health resources, should aim to reduce the number of years of life lost, with particular priority to the most disadvantaged. However, in a pandemic like this, the vaccine distribution will affect behaviour and welfare beyond health. The indirect value of avoided deaths is so great for society that an adjustment to years of life lost will likely have little significance. The more lives saved by the vaccine, the faster the other four goals will be reached.* \[C, p. 14\]. 

 The report created significant discussion, in leading Norwegian press outputs and in professional journals, on whether health care professionals or younger people should be prioritised over older people, on the basis of arguments discussed by, but eventually rejected by the expert group, as a result of Holm’s research \[D\]. 

 The panel’s recommendations are described by Littmann as “ *an important component of the immunisation strategy that was adopted by the Ministry of Health and Care Services on 5 December 2020, and implemented on 27 December 2020*” \[B\]. Holm’s *“crucial”* involvement in the priority\-setting process is acknowledged as having *“greatly improved the consistency and clarity of the recommendations that form the basic principles for the distribution of vaccines against COVID\-19 in Norway”* \[B\]. Implementation of the policy has proceeded according to the priority list recommended by the group, commencing with the vaccination of the 1,300,000 people in the highest priority category and subsequently adopted the dynamic shift recommended by the group, to give higher priority to health care workers in the event of changes to the epidemic \[E\]. 

 **Denmark** 

 On 1 December 2020, Holm was appointed to a philosophers’ group which was convened to provide advice on the ethical issues of COVID\-19 vaccine prioritisation in Denmark. His appointment was based on his research expertise on ethics and infectious disease and his recent participation in the Norwegian ethics group advising on vaccine prioritisation and his contributions to the group’s final report. The Danish group reported directly to the Danish Health Authority, which has responsibility for the Danish vaccine priority plan and its implementation. The Danish Health Authority published a prioritisation strategy which in large part replicated the strategy recommended by the Norwegian ethics group, but with a stronger emphasis on priority to vulnerable groups in the community \[F\]. Preparation and publication of that strategy resulted in widespread public and professional debate on the tension of focussing on the old as a priority group in the first phase of the vaccine roll out as against health care workers \[D\]. 

 The Philosophers’ group helped to clarify a robust ethical basis for the Danish Health Authority’s vaccine priority plan.  According to Dr Stine Ulendorf Jacobsen, the Danish Health Authority’s Special Adviser on Emergency Preparedness for Infectious Disease, Holm advanced the interests of older people in his advice: 

 *“In the discussion Professor Holm emphasised how a policy giving priority to the old can be justified by considerations of the equal value of the lives of older people, and can also be defended by taking account of the evidence of the very large age differentials in mortality among those infected... He also articulated how more abstract philosophical arguments can be made accessible to key stakeholders and the general public.”* \[G\] 

 The group had its first meeting with the Director General on 3 December 2020. Its advice had a beneficial impact on the development and roll out of the vaccination strategy in that it supported and enabled the Danish Health Authority to prioritise older and more vulnerable people over younger health care workers during the first phase of vaccinations. Ulendorf Jacobsen notes that “ *Professor Holm’s research and expertise were invaluable in shaping the advice of the group to the Danish Health Authority, and the communication of the credibility of the vaccination policy to key stakeholders and the public.”* \[G\] *.* The roll\-out of the vaccination strategy as at 31 December 2020 demonstrates adherence to the prioritisation policy \[H\]. 

 **2. Shaping Good Governance in COVID\-19 Challenge Studies** 

 The UK’s Vaccine Task Force, established in May 2020 to progress the development of a COVID\-19 vaccine, identified that human challenge studies for COVID\-19 vaccines were likely to be of critical importance given the short timeframes needed to meet public health demands. The UK government accepted the Task Force’s recommendation and invested GBP33,000,000 in a partnership involving pharmaceutical company Open Orphan, Imperial College London and the Royal Free Hospital to develop the world’s first human challenge trial for COVID\-19 vaccines. Although virus challenge studies per se are not novel, it is highly unusual to conduct them so soon after the emergence of a potentially lethal pathogen. The need to confirm a robust ethical basis for these studies was accepted from the outset and noted in Parliament \[I\]. 

 In recognition of these unique demands, the Health Research Authority \(HRA\) established a special Research Ethics Committee \(REC\) in November 2020 to consider future applications for COVID\-19 challenge studies. As a result of his research expertise, recent relevant publications \(especially outputs \[1\] and \[3\]\) and his experience as a member of the HRA advisory panel, Holm was invited by the HRA to train the members of the newly constituted HRA REC.  Holm’s input was requested specifically because he has cautioned of the ethical and operational challenges of running such real\-world studies. 

 Around 20 Committee Members attended the training over two days, with training devised and delivered by Holm and four other experts. As part of a debate on the ethical considerations, Holm presented the ethical case against COVID\-19 challenge studies, based on his work on the role of research ethics in pandemics and his recent paper on controlled human infection with COVID\-19 to study vaccines and treatments \[3\]. He highlighted the fact that the idealised assumption that might make challenge studies ethically acceptable in principle are unlikely to be met in practice.  Members had the opportunity to discuss the issues with the aim of learning how to think about the ethical issues that might be raised by specific studies presented to the Committee. 

 The training was highly beneficial to members of the REC, with 80% recording their training experience as ‘excellent’ \[J\]. Crucially, it was instrumental in the development of guidance by the HRA for the REC members, as it was used by the HRA to develop and refine a framework of ethical considerations that was subsequently applied in the review of a COVID\-19 challenge study \[K\]. By 31 December 2020, the framework had been used to evaluate applications for the first two phases of the COVID\-19 challenge trial and resulted in the demand by the REC for further information about the research protocol for the identification and screening of volunteers, and the protocol for the viral dosing \[J\]. The HRA confirm that “ *Professor Holm’s training for the members of the Committee has provided a vitally important means by which* \[REC\] *members may hold researchers accountable for their proposed trials, maintain public confidence in regulatory processes, and ensure public safety*” \[J\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Wood is a vital material for sustainable manufacturing and construction, but it must be used efficiently. Though renewable, it is a limited resource. This award winning, industry\-funded research **advanced knowledge of key properties of UK and Irish\-grown timber, and the factors that influence them.**Research led to **improved standards and practices for the production of timber engineering construction products across Europe.** It directly benefitted UK and Irish growers and processors through **reduced wastage in manufacturing and trade, and by providing access to higher value markets**. Specifically, it supported new and improved grading, improved European standards for grading, increased knowledge of species for forest diversification, and improved quality control for the wood packaging industry, that has become even more relevant in preparation for Brexit.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Trees are high on the current political agenda for afforestation, and as the most important source of renewable biotic materials. Wood is a vital material for sustainable manufacturing and construction and is core to important goals such as green growth, zero carbon and affordable homes, as well as satisfying many basic daily needs. Demand has caused timber prices to rise by unprecedented levels in 2020, but this is not a temporary situation. Increasing, competing, demands on land, and conflicting priorities need interdisciplinary research to find solutions to meet the technical, economic, social, cultural, and environmental aspects of a material flow that literally shapes the landscape in which we live. Even forest\-rich European countries import wood due to limited availability of certain varieties, while global demand for wood continues to rise. 

 The ways forward are by no means clear. Perspectives differ on how forests should be created and managed, what role they play as a source for raw materials, and how they can be used to respond to the climate and ecological challenges we face. Research by the Centre for Wood Science and Technology \(CWST\) at Edinburgh Napier University \(ENU\) provides key information for decision makers to prepare the paths for the current and next generation of forestry and timber, linking forest planning and management to wood properties and end uses. 

 CWST’s core work is about quantifying and assessing wood properties. Although the Centre also covers other aspects of the industry, the research described here concerns construction timber and wooden pallets \(which each account for approximately one third of the UK’s home\-grown sawn timber usage\). This research work involves collection of large amounts of new data from fieldwork, often in close collaboration with Forest Research \(government agency\). The work on construction timber can be divided into two types, structural timber \(e.g. for timber frame, cross\-laminated timber etc\) and non\-structural timber \(e.g. external cladding and tiling battens\). 

 For structural timber the focus has been on improving mechanical performance and safe construction within the *European Construction Products Regulations* \(and UK equivalent going forward\). In 2003 the Scottish Funding Council funded the creation of the *Strategic Integrated Research in Timber* \(SIRT\) project, which is still ongoing **\[P1\]**. This work sought to understand fundamental properties or UK and Irish wood, including tree growth and non\-destructive assessment \(of key wood properties without damage\). Research has been heavily influenced by knowledge exchange activity, and crucially, included British and European product testing and production standards committee work underpinned by this research. This is led by Ridley\-Ellis, and supported by Adams and Lehneke. Since 2017, a collaboration “ *WoodProps for Ireland*” **\[P3\]** has complemented this research with a similar approach for Ireland. The National University of Ireland, Galway, was funded to work in partnership with ENU to co\-investigate wood properties in both countries. The ENU role was particularly focused on grading and standards expertise, and fundamental wood properties. How this research is core to European standardisation work for structural timber is summarised in **O1**, which was written prior to a major change in those standards. **O2** is an example of how this research connects to decisions being made on new planting and forest policy. New approaches to make improvements for home grown timber are illustrated in **O3,** and **O4** is a summary of what is involved for one species. The body of the grading work is much larger, and summarised in **O5**, as it was in 2018. 

 For non\-structural timber, the focus is more varied, covering factors such as durability, appearance, and proper work execution, as well as some mechanical performance requirements. As part of this work, Davies led projects relating to his specialist expertise in durability, timber facades and wood packaging material, with a particularly impactful project in 2013\-2014, the first research study into kilning of green pallets ever conducted **\[P2\]**. In 2018 CWST conducted the largest ever testing programme concerning the performance of tiling battens, funded by industry **\[P4\]**. This developed the sampling design, arranged for machine grading, conducted visual grading measurements, carried out strength testing and devised new rules for grading based on the analysis **\[O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research **advanced knowledge of key properties of UK and Irish\-grown timber.** It **improved standards for production of timber engineering construction products across Europe**, and directly benefitted UK and Irish growers and processors through **reduced wastage in manufacturing and by providing access to higher value markets**. 

 The UK and Irish industries have similar growth conditions and forest management and industry practices, and both operate under the European standards \(CEN\) framework on international trade. In the UK alone, the forest and timber industries have a gross value added of \~GBP13 billion, and directly employ 175,000 people \(Office for National Statistics 2019\). Approximately 90% of the sawn construction timber produced in the UK is graded based on this research \(\~0.8 million m<sup>3</sup> per year\). The value of this work was recognised by industry organisation Grown in Britain who awarded Ridley\-Ellis “ *Woodland Hero*” for 2016. It also contributed to recognition in the award of the Queens Anniversary Prize in 2015. A production director of a major UK sawmill said “ *I would like to just say how invaluable this research is to shaping the future of our industry. We have a valuable timber resource in the UK and your work is hugely instrumental in ensuring we collectively maximise its value…This is essential research underpinning the successful future of our industry.”* **\[C1\]** 

 **Influencing European, British and Irish Standards and their Use**Research has improved knowledge of the key properties of UK and Irish\-grown timber and their drivers. This has also resulted in improved standards for production and use of sustainable timber construction products across Europe \(from light timber frame to tall cross laminated timber\). This helps to ensure the future of economically, environmentally and socially sustainable forestry and timber, while reinforcing the safety of timber construction for all. The research has also been described by an Irish forest industry representative as “ *essential, and in many cases acts as a catalyst for industry to make subsequent investments in new capacity or new product development.”* **\[C2\]**. 

 Research has supported new ways of grading structural timber \(a form of non\-destructive strength assessment\) **\[e.g. O3, O4,** **O5\]**, and non\-structural timber in work with tiling battens **\[O6\].** It has also directly responded to the need to improve European standards **\[O1\]**, and sought to improve knowledge of species to inform forest diversification and associated policy **\[e.g. O2\]**. It has also supported the wood packaging industry in satisfying customer needs **\[P2\]**. 

 ENU is named in the Scottish industry action plan “ *Roots for further growth*” \(by the Scottish Forest and Timber Technologies Industry Leadership Group, and launched by the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy in our laboratories in November 2018\). The University is cited as a supporting institution in their ambition for the forest and timber sector to double its economic contribution to Scotland’s economy by 2030 through innovation and investment \(to GBP2 billion per annum\). This is based on research\-informed expertise in the knowledge of key properties of UK and Irish\-grown timber, which has resulted in new and improved possibilities for production and use of sustainable timber construction products. However, the impact is certainly not limited to Scotland. 

 Work on British and European standards has led to the development of British standards for timber facades, and improvement of the harmonized European Standard \(and supporting standards\) for structural timber **\[P1\]** \(to improve safety and yields, and avoid unnecessary costs and processes\). 

 This standardisation work goes beyond routine maintenance and improvement. At European level, the most important committees are CEN TC124 WG2 and its task group TG1, which examines and approves new grading settings for structural timber sold in the European market. Ridley\-Ellis has led this expert group since 2018, selected by other members \(country’s grading specialists, researchers and conformity assessors, nominated by the national standards bodies of, most actively, Sweden, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Finland, Slovenia, Austria, Norway, Ireland, Spain and UK, but covering all CEN members, including Turkey\). As an Italian timber industry representative explains “ *This standardization work is only possible at this high level based on the research work performed by the CWST*.” **\[C3\]** 

 This work on standards and grading has allowed access to new markets, and increased efficiency and safety \(reduced rejects, increased yields and improved processes\) **\[C4, C5\]**. This also has upstream benefits for growers and downstream benefits for secondary processors and ultimately the public, via better environmental impact from construction, strengthened economic sustainability of forestry, and forest practices more aligned to public expectations of forestry. Improved standards also improve building quality and reduce problems for construction companies and building owners, especially the case for the cladding standard BS 8605\-1:2014. Details include research justified changes to European standards that improve the safety of those standards and also improve grading efficiency of UK and Irish grown timber \(which can affect production yields of 10% and more\). The Chair of the UK Timber Grading Committee \(and a sawmill General Manager\) said “ *The work on standardisation, underpinned by this research, is critically important in ensuring that standards are fit for purpose; allowing timber to be safely specified and enabling growers and producers to make informed long\-term investment decisions as they look to expand the use of home grown timber and bring their products to market. This body of research has been a key element of ensuring changes to the standards have been appropriate for our industry, and avoided some potentially costly problems*” **\[C4\]** 

 **Increasing Productivity for UK and Irish Timber Manufacturers**The research **\[P1\]** developed grading settings for modern grading machines for UK grown larch in response to the outbreak of the tree pathogen *Phytophthora ramorum*. This allowed the industry to process the timber from large\-scale sanitation felling. Later, in collaboration with NUI Galway , this was extended to Irish larch **\[P3\]**. Work in collaboration with NUI Galway to produce the first machine grading settings for UK and Irish grown Douglas fir **\[O4, P1, P3\]** allowed mills easier access to the construction market. These complement CWST’s work widening the range of grading options for the main commercial species \(spruce\), especially for smaller sawmills, and have included creation of a new strength class \(“ *C16\+*”\) with optimised properties for this resource **\[P1\]**. This is now available on the market and used in construction. This properties and grading work has been described by the Technical Manager of a major sawmill as being “ *critical for us to understand the wood we are processing, its limits and also where the industry can take advantage of strengths as this will help us deliver a better product and reduce wastage and increase yields*.” **\[C6\]**. 

 After a particularly bad international problem with stain and mould in 2013, research for proper kiln drying or phytosanitation heat treatment of green pallets enabled UK manufacturers to give 100% guarantees of no stain and mould. This has helped producers of pallets for all sectors, and the President of the Timber Packaging and Pallet Confederation states “ *for those manufacturers supplying pharmaceutical, food, drinks, etc customers it has been invaluable*” **\[C7\]**, avoiding the “ *disastrous*” risk of needing to switch to plastic pallets only. Over the last 5 years, 83 million pallets have been kilned or heat treated in the UK, but this is of increasing importance in light of the COVID\-19 pandemic, as the industry has been using heat treated pallets to ship vaccines globally, while also preparing stock for the 1/1/2021 Brexit deadline. This is because ISPM15 heat treatment \(to be required for the 60 to 100 million pallet trips between UK and EU\) can increase the likelihood of staining and subsequently mould. The industry best practice for pallet drying, developed from this research work has been shared by industry association TIMCON in Europe and the USA **\[P2\]**. 

 The largest ever study on tiling battens **\[O6\]** \(the first ever grading settings for this product under European system\), allowed the Irish market to continue to produce tiling battens to their new national code of practice. This presents a very large market, since most buildings have them. This was another rapid response to industry need, enabled by our substantial existing body of research on home grown spruce, and deep understanding of the processes **\[O6, P4, P1\]**. A Technical Manager at a major Irish sawmill, explains the value of this as being *“part of our basket of products”* and *“if we didn’t have the battens, we could easily miss out in the region of €1 million in sales per annum”* **\[C6\]**. This need also illustrates the importance of standardisation work to avoid such problems before they affect industry. 

 Gathering of timber properties data for a number of lesser\-used species **\[P1\]** has informed growers and policy makers of what to plant for enhanced forest resilience \(pests, diseases, climate change\), and work for sawmills to make it easier for them to process these species and find markets **\[C8, C9\]**. As a UK timber industry representative explains our work “ *identifying the structural characteristics of a number of alternative species has informed the tree breeding sub sector where to focus their next breeding programmes, which are extremely expensive*”. **\[C8\]** 

 **Route to impact** 

 CWST’s research achieves impact via knowledge exchange and integration with industry partners working with us on projects, leadership work on standards and industry committees. Wider stakeholders are engaged through articles for magazines, workshops and CPD seminars, and dialogue. Academic conferences and journal papers are an indirect means of impact, via other researchers.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Bartlett School of Planning’s research on trams has provided insights that have influenced public transport investments across North West Europe \(NWE\). As part of the Sintropher project, the research examined innovative tram\-based systems as a means to tackle social and economic deprivation by examining impacts of public transport investments in over 50 European urban areas. Research findings: i\) underpinned EUR22,300,000 in strategic investments in public transport across NWE; ii\) provided the basis for regeneration in urban areas and regions, and shifts in travel behaviours; and, iii\) critiqued professional project appraisal approaches in NWE and internationally.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Planning and implementing best practice in public transport projects** 

 Funded as an EU Interreg transnational cooperation project, from 2014\-17, Sintropher \(Sustainable Integrated Transport Options for Peripheral European Regions\) was designed to develop improved and sustainable transport links for poorly\-connected regions in North West Europe \(NWE\). Public transport has been particularly difficult to fund in areas of NWE that have multiple social deprivation problems. As a result, there is a strong and widespread local perception that little infrastructure investment is being directed to these areas. To improve access to ‘peripheral’ or ‘left\-behind’ regions, Sintropher examined tram\-train systems, as well as single\-track tramways and interchanges linking national or transnational rail or air hubs in European cities and regions. 

 Sixteen partners, including public transport operators, local authorities and regional transport agencies, joined lead partner UCL on the project. The Bartlett’s School of Planning led research on the planning of transport and new urban neighbourhoods **\[a\]** and the linkages between transport, urban development and social equity **\[b, c\]**. For example, the research examined how tram projects are planned, appraised and implemented in Germany and France, and how this good practice might be applied elsewhere, such as in the UK. Tram\-based technologies, associated developmental and social impacts of infrastructure investment, and national decision\-making and project appraisal processes were explored. 

 As impact\-driven research, Sintropher invested over 80% of its EUR26,800,000 funding in pilot projects and demonstrations. New tram\-based projects were supported with funding, including: an extended Blackpool tramway along the Fylde Coast, UK; an extended Kusttram, West Flanders, Belgium; upgrades to the Kassel RegioTram, North Hesse, Germany; the new singletrack, Ligne 2 in Valenciennes, France; and assessment of the disused cross\-border rail link, Nijmegen Kleve, the Netherlands. 

 **Transferring best practice from the Kassel ‘model’ project** 

 Sintropher examined the regionally integrative Kassel tram\-train system and its economic impacts to inform investments in Blackpool, Valenciennes, Saarbrücken and West Flanders. By integrating transport modes across urban areas and regions, innovations led to reduced costs and increased social benefits **\[d\]**. 

 The research and projects demonstrated the benefits of tram\-based infrastructure in economically disadvantaged urban areas and regions in allowing integrated connections with central cities and peripheral urban areas and facilitating improved access to employment and other activities. The research further examined the decision\-making process and the impact of transport projects on social mobility in relation to appropriation and the take up of newly\-accessible employment opportunities and other activities. In addition, Sintropher used a political economy perspective to explore why certain innovative transport projects were implemented, examining the different viewpoints and discourses in a transport project case study and showing how the mediation of multi\-actor perspectives are critical to project implementation **\[e\]**. 

 **Developing an appraisal framework that includes wider public policy benefits and multi\-actor viewpoints** 

 Transport planning projects are conventionally evaluated through cost\-benefit assessment \(CBA\) and multi\-criteria assessment \(MCA\). Bartlett research **\[f\]** challenged these traditional approaches, showing that such methodologies are too simplistic for transport planning, and lead to ineffective prioritisation. The findings suggested that they should instead be complemented with or replaced by participatory MCA approaches, which more fully represent diverse actors’ views. 

 The research developed a novel appraisal framework and participatory MCA decision support tool, incorporating multi\-actor views and assessing project options against local policy criteria. This was tested in the UK Fylde coast regional case study, considering the upgrading of the South Fylde rail line, including tram and tram\-train options, to improve connectivity and promote regeneration and growth **\[g\]**. When compared to the CBA, this analysis produced a much stronger case for investment. It also resulted in a preference for tram and tram\-train options with a connection to the Blackpool tram, diverging from the conventional option of an improvement of the existing rail service or indeed highways. Hence the type of project investment and process of project appraisal can both be critical to the resultant impact on urban development and wider public policy goals.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sintropher has had major impacts in reconceptualising and investing in new tram\-based projects across North West Europe, leading to significant travel behaviour changes, urban development and economic and social impacts. 

 **4.1 Changing public transport investment strategy in North Western Europe** 

 The economic impacts of regional public transport systems, connecting urban centres to their surrounding regions are often a very positive influence on GDP and growth **\[1\]**. Utilising best practice from Kassel and Saarbrücken, tram\-train projects are being developed in the UK, Europe, and internationally, including Sintropher’s case studies. Organisations such as the Light Rail Transit Association have used the analysis and evidence from Sintropher to plan and lobby for tram\-train projects in the UK. For example, the Sheffield\-Rotherham tram\-train pilot project is underway and a regional tram\-train project is being planned in the Manchester city\-region. The Technical Director, Light Rail Transit Association, cites Sintropher research – specifically evidence pointing to employment, educational, leisure and environmental benefits to areas of social and economic deprivation – as being of “great significance \[in\] changing the way that innovative tram\-based projects are perceived in the UK, and will lead to many more project investments of this type” **\[2\]**. 

 The research influenced proposals for new regional public transport investments in Blackpool. The Group Leader for Transport Projects in Blackpool Council cites Sintropher as providing the foundation for a “new \[transport\] system \[that\] is superior and future\-proofed to enable further extensions,” and further states that the project “has made a real contribution to the north\-west England economy. The new system has made a major positive difference to the Blackpool promenade environment, particularly as the now heritage trams continue to operate in between the core services” **\[3\]**. 

 Sintropher has been fundamental to developing innovative proposals for urban and regional public transport investments in Northern England **\[4\] \[5\]**. This includes regional tram\-train and also a high\-speed rail connection linking Liverpool\-Manchester\-Leeds\-Sheffield\-Hull, initially proposed by Professor Sir Peter Hall. This latter project was subsequently developed by the UK Government as High Speed Rail 3 \(HS3\) within the Northern Way proposals **\[6\]**. 

 Other cities, such as Oxford, are considering regional tram\-based investments, using lessons from Sintropher **\[7\]**, and Transport for London \(TfL\) is developing large public transport projects that regenerate urban corridors and neighbourhoods, such as Crossrail2. Sintropher’s emphasis on wider measures of investment value, such as the potential for trams to facilitate regeneration, are assisting in the planning and appraisal of such projects. 

 **4.2 Impacts of Sintropher’s investment in tram\-based projects for public infrastructure** 

 By examining the social impacts of the demonstration projects, Sintropher’s research has shown that innovative tram\-based projects benefit areas with high levels of social and economic deprivation – so\-called ‘left behind’ areas. These areas are the focus of new public transport investments, assisting with environmental and social equity public policy goals. Sintropher invested EUR22,300,000 in tram\-based projects, which leveraged further EUR1,000,000,000\-EUR1,500,000,000 for infrastructure and promote related commercial and housing developments in the public transport corridors and station catchment areas **\[8\]**. 

 <ins>Influencing travel behaviour in low\-income areas in Valenciennes</ins> 

 The tram projects led to changed travel behaviours in the case study cities, with wider environmental, social and economic impacts. For example, in Valenciennes, around 19,000,000 passengers use the tram system annually. EUR13,000,000 from Sintropher co\-funded an innovative single\-track tramway system, as part of a EUR150,000,000 Ligne 2 project. This was a major EU demonstration project for single\-track tram technology, and the investment supported a priority urban regeneration corridor in the Valenciennes urban plan. 

 A survey of passengers on the Valenciennes tram \(Hickman et al., 2019\), illustrates the impact of Sintropher\-funded public transport investment on travel behaviours in a low\-income urban area. The results show that use of the tram was by low\-income groups: 66% of respondents had a household income of less than EUR2,000 per month and 39% less than EUR1,000 per month. 45% agree or strongly agree that the tram allows them to access employment opportunities; and 17% agree or strongly agree that the tram helps them to reach employment opportunities that were not reachable before. 95% agree or strongly agree that the tram network is well configured and goes to useful destinations. Finally, 67% agree or strongly agree that the tram helps to reduce inequalities of income and education in the region **\[9\]**. 

 **4.3** **Challenging conventional project appraisal approaches and disseminating good practice** 

 The research contributed to wider professional debate on transport project appraisal approaches, including the requirement for multi\-actor MCA approaches as part of a more participatory approach to transport appraisal. TfL, for example, has developed project appraisal approaches that draw on multi\-criteria strategic appraisal. The Head of Strategic Analysis at TFL indicates that Sintropher as a whole and the “approaches to transport project appraisal, including CBA, MCA and participatory MCA… \[have\] been of great significance, influencing the debate and practice relating to the way projects are assessed” **\[10\]**. 

 Research and best practice guidance on appraisals have been disseminated internationally. The POLIS network – a network of EU cities and regions concerning transport innovation – has hosted briefing papers on its website, covering innovative approaches to the financing of transport infrastructure and technologies for light\- rail or tram\-based systems. A good practice interchange guide for NWE was published, and similar resources have been developed for the Asian Development Bank for use in the planning of high\-speed railway stations and surrounding neighbourhoods in China **\[11\]**. 

 An online course on sustainable urban mobility, developed by the Bartlett School of Planning, and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit \(GIZ\), is available via Futurelearn. Aimed at transport planning practitioners, participants on the first runs of the Part 1 and 2 course totalled over 5,000, including professionals and public stakeholders from the Global South **\[12\]**. This course discusses the implementation of sustainable urban mobility projects worldwide, giving attendees the tools to sustain and extend the impact of these projects.

Research on management informs both private sector firms and their training as well as making public sector and publicly procured projects more efficient. Within the domain of regional development we also find several case studies focussed on improving the tourism industry and within the domain of public investments strategies for spurring public and private sector initiatives for innovation feature prominently. Many projects focus on making particular sectors more efficient: this ranges from farming, to supply chains and from social enterprises to infrastructure projects. Focus on firm growth as well as on the creation of new companies and startups and the fostering of entrepreneurship also goes along with much evidence for job creation that results from the interplay of business and research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 LSE researchers have developed a tool for theorising, analysing, and generating insights from healthcare complaints submitted by patients and families to hospitals. The Healthcare Complaints Analysis Tool \(HCAT\) is the world’s first empirically tested coding system for systematically analysing and aggregating written data provided by patients through complaints on poor quality and unsafe healthcare experiences. The work has generated global impacts through the use of HCAT by policymakers and healthcare organisations to analyse, monitor, and learn from complaints. HCAT has been adopted, as a matter of policy, at a state level for analysing and learning from complaints and patient feedback in healthcare. It has also begun to be adapted for analysing complaints in non\-healthcare government departments \(e.g. Ministry of Justice\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A healthcare complaint is a formal communication from patients \(or someone speaking on their behalf\) about a failure in service provision. Complaints might, for example, be about medical errors or poor\-quality care. Complaints seek an institutional response to a failure, often in the form of an explanation, investigation, apology, or change of procedure **\[1\]**. 

 Healthcare organisations receive large numbers of complaints; NHS Trusts receive more than 130,000 each year. Around one in ten patients experience unintended harm in hospital, and 14% of such incidences lead to permanent disability or death **\[2\]**. It has been suggested that the information reported in complaints could contribute to reducing the number of these adverse events. However, assessment of complaints has been rudimentary and haphazard, focusing on complaint volume rather than learning from the substantive issues. As a result, patients’ complaints about healthcare have had minimal impact on improving services **\[2\]**. 

 LSE research underpinning the impacts described here began with a systematic review that identified the poor state of tools for analysing patient complaints. It then proceeded through a systematic programme of research to create a tool and a method of analysis to identify robust and valid insights for quality improvement. 

1.  **A systematic review of the literature on healthcare complaints**, published in 2014, drew on data from 59 studies and 88,069 patient complaints to outline the first taxonomy for analysing information in healthcare complaints **\[2\]**. Complaints were theorised as an alternative \(and patient\-centric\) form of data for monitoring and improving hospital safety. The paper built on previous research analysing the types of healthcare problems that are difficult to capture through hospital monitoring systems **\[3\]**. 

1.  **Establishing the first reliable tool for systematically analysing and benchmarking the problems and severity of complaints received by hospitals:** the Healthcare Complaints Analysis Tool \(HCAT\) **\[4\]** was developed by Reader and Gillespie at LSE in 2015. It is freely available for use in analysing the types of problems reported in healthcare complaints, their severity, their consequent harm, and where they occur in the healthcare service. Key innovations include the development of a method for quantifying the highly qualitative and unstandardised information reported within complaints, and for distinguishing the severity of problems reported in complaints \(e.g. expensive parking compared to life\-changing medication errors\). 

1.  **Conceptualising the value of information reported through healthcare complaints for organisational learning:** in 2017, Reader and Gillespie analysed 1,100 complaints made to the NHS. They used this to report on the application of HCAT to a national sample of healthcare complaints. Their findings, reported in a 2018 paper **\[1\]**, suggested two forms of critical insight which might provide an analytical frame for monitoring and improving healthcare services. The first of these was that complaints reveal “hot spots” of problematic care, showing patterns and causes of adverse events and near misses in a hospital or healthcare system. The second was that complaints also reveal “blind spots” in service provision. This refers to aspects of healthcare delivery that are difficult for hospitals to monitor. These can include problems in access to a hospital, systemic problems such as poor communication between units, and omissions in care, as when patients are not fed. 

1.  **Identifying associations between healthcare complaints and hospital\-level mortality rates:** analysis of healthcare complaints \(n = 2,017; 59 hospitals\) conducted in 2018 showed, for the first time, strong associations between scale of the harm \(e.g. death\) and severity of clinical problems \(e.g. cancer misdiagnoses\) reported in complaints and hospital\-level mortality rates. This association was shown to be stronger for healthcare complaints than for employee surveys, incident reports, and patient satisfaction surveys. On this basis, Reader and Gillespie theorised complaints to healthcare services as attempts by the public to intervene and improve hospital care, and proposed that the information they provide is valid and supplementary for investigating and supporting decision\-making on hospital safety **\[5\]**. 

 **Related research:** in work with colleagues at Imperial College London, the research team has also argued that complaint handling should be conceptualised in terms of two separate pathways: complaint redress \(which has been the focus for organisations\) and complaint analysis and learning \(which has been neglected\) **\[6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The healthcare complaints research described here has synthesised and developed a field within healthcare. HCAT has led to a new body of research on the use of complaints to investigate and analyse safety in healthcare, as evidenced by the growing number of papers using it to investigate hospital safety **\[A\]**. The work is also widely used by practitioners in healthcare and beyond: the systematic review published in 2014 **\[2\]** has been downloaded more than 100,000 times. A free online portal of HCAT resources \- including the HCAT tool itself, along with an online training package, data visualisation tool, and benchmark dataset \- has been created in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research Patient Safety Translational Research Centre \(PSTRC\) at Imperial College \(see  [https://www.feedbackfirst.co.uk/hcat](https://www.feedbackfirst.co.uk/hcat)\). The PSTRC, which is itself a partnership between Imperial College London and the Imperial College Healthcare Trust \(ICHT\), is one of three centres in England dedicated to developing the scientific evidence base for safer care. HCAT is being used to analyse complaints received at the Trust, which is driving the application of HCAT for improving patient safety in other UK hospitals. 

 **Changing UK Government understanding of the utility of healthcare complaints:** in 2016/17, after reading the research published in **\[2\]** and **\[4\]**, the UK Cabinet Office \(CO\) launched an investigation into the feasibility and benefits of applying HCAT to analyse and learn from healthcare complaints sent to hospitals **\[B\]**. The CO commissioned the Behavioural Insights Team \(BIT\) to explore the utility of HCAT to NHS Trusts, with a view to better understanding whether it could be used more within the NHS, as well as the wider public sector. To pilot its use in this way, BIT used HCAT to analyse complaints in four UK healthcare trusts, and to evaluate stakeholder \(e.g. complaints managers, boards\) perspectives on the value of the tool and its outputs. The BIT published its final report for the CO in May 2017. This concluded that, on the basis of its evaluation, HCAT “ *is a significant advance on the current national reporting of healthcare complaints, which focuses on volumes alone*” and “ *adds value beyond the current complaints reporting system in Trusts, for example by providing learning and improvement opportunities*” **\[B**, pp. 4 and 36 **\]**. It therefore recommended that HCAT be adopted more widely across the healthcare service, eventually replacing the existing national complaints coding system \(KO41\). The report included explicit recommendations both that health policymakers consider using HCAT and that further work should be carried out to explore the potential to expand the use of HCAT beyond the health sector **\[B**, pp. 4\-5 **\]**. A report on “The Inquiry into Hyponatraemia\-Related Deaths”, published in January 2018 by the Northern Irish government, also acknowledged the potentially valuable insights that complaints contain about patient safety problems. It noted that trials of HCAT had already begun in Northern Ireland with a view to generating “ *more meaningful analysis and comparison of data from complaints within and across Trusts*”, which it suggested “ *could prove of considerable benefit for both individual Trusts and regional learning*” **\[C**, p. 72 **\]**. 

 **Impacts of HCAT on UK healthcare:** the main impact of HCAT has been to change how healthcare organisations analyse and learn from complaints. Its dissemination through the academic publications, new HCAT website, and CO report **\[B\]** has supported the use of HCAT in a range of healthcare institutions. 

 Much of the new use of HCAT has been driven by partners at ICHT, a leading NHS Trust treating over one and a half million patients per year, which has itself used HCAT in various capacities since 2018 **\[D\]**. The Trust receives approximately 1,000 complaints annually and uses HCAT to analyse and learn from these. Quarterly reports on these analyses are submitted to the Trust’s board and used to identify areas for improvement. ICHT has linked HCAT data to staff\-reported safety incidents to improve understanding of any adverse events that occur in the Trust. 

 Further to recommendations submitted by the BIT to the CO, Imperial College London has also established a new stream of research \(funded through an NIHR grant awarded to the Imperial PSTRC\) to test the effectiveness of HCAT as a potential alternative to the current UK complaints coding system. In particular, the focus has been on establishing HCAT as a means to identify concrete and addressable safety problems reported within complaints **\[D\]**. 

 Further to the recommendations in both the 2017 CO report **\[B\]** and the 2018 Northern Irish government report **\[C\]**, HCAT has also been applied in the Southern Health and Social Care Trust \(Northern Ireland\), which was a participant in the BIT evaluation of HCAT. The Trust, which provides health and social care services to a population of over 380,000 people, now regularly uses HCAT to analyse complaints it receives. Feedback and analysis are shared with its board. Here, HCAT is used as a “smoke alarm” to identify emerging issues in safety and to support continual improvement in care **\[E\]**. Elsewhere, the Scottish government recommended, on the basis of a trial by Dumfries and Galloway NHS Trust, that NHS hospitals use HCAT to analyse and learn from complaints **\[F\]**. Other UK Trusts, for instance Great Ormond Street Hospital, are also in the process of applying HCAT **\[G\]**. Finally, on the basis of HCAT research, Department of Health and Social Care Minister Nadine Dorries is drawing upon LSE expertise to develop policy for better managing complaints in NHS hospitals **\[H\]**. 

 **Impacts on international healthcare:** the Health Services Executive \(HSE\), which is responsible for delivering healthcare in the **Republic of Ireland**, has tailored HCAT for use in the Irish context and in community services to improve the classification system used for analysing complaints. HCAT has reshaped how the HSE considers complaints, which are now seen as key to identifying organisational risks. A key impact on the HSE has been a change in its focus on complaints, from “ *management of an individual complaint to an understanding of the value of aggregate information*” **\[I\]**. The preliminary application of HCAT in Irish hospitals revealed a range of previously unrecognised issues \(e.g. around accessing care\) and HCAT is now being adopted in various hospitals \(e.g. University Hospital Limerick\) **\[I\]**. The HSE has also used HCAT to interpret poor experiences reported in the in\-patient and maternity experience surveys **\[J\]**. HCAT has also been adapted for use in Ireland by the Patient Advocacy Service. This Department of Health\-funded body supports healthcare users who have poor experiences; it is to analyse and address the issues reported to it **\[K\]**. 

 HCAT has also been applied in **Australia**. Since 2017, Safer Care Victoria \(the federal government office for healthcare and safety improvement\) has used HCAT to categorise complaints raised with the Ministry for Health **\[L\]**. Here, HCAT has had profound impacts through its use to code 1,300\+ complaints sent to the Ministry of Health, to triage complaints, and to direct them to appropriate government agencies for learning \(e.g. clinical units and organisational directorates\). Information and analysis generated from this process has subsequently been used to provide senior decision\-makers with an overview of complaint patterns. HCAT is integrated into the computer systems at Victoria and has been adapted for use there, most recently to code complaints around COVID\-19. The codes underlying HCAT have been used to inform and change the methodology for coding clinical incidents reported in hospitals. Consequently, HCAT is now used to categorise healthcare feedback at a state\-wide level and all health services in Victoria will be required to use the HCAT sub\-categories to classify and report consumer feedback from 2021. 

 In **Canada**, a trial of HCAT has been carried out at the Provincial Health Services Authority for British Columbia. The software used to collect information on patient incidents \(DATIX\) has been configured to facilitate the use of HCAT so that it can feed through to information dashboards on healthcare performance across the province **\[M\]**. 

 In 2019, the **Saudi Arabian** government used HCAT as the basis for developing its own “healthcare complaint taxonomy”, which is now being used to link healthcare complaints with risk management **\[N\]**. 

 The research team has also had informal discussions about using HCAT in Denmark, Japan, Jordan, New Zealand, and with the Joint Commission in the USA. 

 **Impacts beyond healthcare:** in line with recommendations to the CO in **\[B\]**, HCAT has begun to be used and deliver impacts beyond healthcare. In the UK Ministry of Justice, it has been adapted \(in commissioned work by LSE\) to analyse complaints from the public to Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service \(HMCTS\). HMCTS, which is responsible for the administration of all criminal, civil, and family courts and tribunals in England and Wales, receives approximately 20,000\-24,000 complaints each year. Their version of HCAT \- known as the Courts and Tribunals Complaints Analysis Tool \(CTCAT\) \- has been integrated into the HMCTS electronic complaints handling system, meaning that every complaint submitted to HMCTS is now analysed using the CTCAT codification taxonomy. To date, it has been used to analyse some 30,000 complaints from the public. Data analysed using CTCAT is used to monitor and identify local and national\-level problems in HMCTS services and to gauge the impact of these on service providers. This provides a basis for the supply of summary insights on complaints at directorate level, and to reveal a range of areas for service improvement \(e.g. delays in probate cases, procedural errors in criminal enforcement, etc.\) **\[O\]**. 

 Finally, HCAT has delivered **commercial impacts** via a long\-term collaboration between LSE and Resolver \- Europe’s largest handler of commercial complaints. The coding and theoretical underpinnings of HCAT have shaped Resolver’s business, in particular by helping to recognise and develop the potential business opportunity of aggregated analyses of complaints in order to support organisational learning. Resolver’s Executive Chairman has attested to the benefits of LSE’s research: “ *Our discussions with Dr Reader and Dr Gillespie have been an excellent platform that has challenged and shaped not just our view of the market we were in. More importantly, through influencing how we conceptualise and analyse complaints, their research has radically altered our view of ourselves and what we could offer potential customers*” **\[P\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 *Englicious* is a free online platform which contains a library of original English language teaching resources sourced from corpora developed at the Survey of English Usage \( **SEU**; a research unit based in the UCL English Department\) that is accessed 438,000 times per year. The resources empower teachers of Key Stages 1\-5 pupils to teach grammar in accordance with new requirements introduced in the 2014 National Curriculum for England. An associated programme of CPD workshops and INSET courses \(online from April 2020\) trained 800 teachers, leading to improvements in professional capacity to teach grammar to KS1\-KS5 pupils. Income generated from the programme \(GBP15,000 \- 20,000 per annum\) was re\-invested into the *Englicious* online platform, contributing to a 100% increase in teachers subscribing to access free teaching resources since 2017. Beyond its main national focus on teachers in England, the *Englicious* website has achieved global impact through the provision of English teaching resources for over 14,000 registered users \(including 9,700 teachers\); the website is used in 227 countries, predominantly the UK, Indonesia, India, the US and the Philippines. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Survey of English Usage at UCL carries out research in English grammar and usage. The SEU has created two language databases \(corpora\): the *British Component of the International Corpus of English* \( **ICE\-GB**\) \( [www.ucl.ac.uk/english\-usage/projects/ice\-gb](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb)\) and the *Diachronic Corpus of Present\-Day Spoken English* \( **DCPSE**\) \( [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/english\-usage/projects/dcpse/](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/dcpse/)\). These corpora are fully tagged and grammatically analysed which allows for the retrieval of grammatical patterns. Researchers at all levels can conduct searches of the corpus with the innovative exploration software **ICECUP** \(International Corpus of English Corpus Utility Program\) which was designed and developed at the SEU. They are indispensable data\-mining resources for anyone interested in the grammar and linguistic features of the spoken and written word. In 2002 SEU staff published *Exploring Natural Language: Working with the British Component of the International Corpus of English*, a comprehensive handbook to ICE\-GB/ICECUP corpus and software that contains full references and concordance alongside six detailed usage case studies \[ **R1**\]. The research underpinning the creation of the corpora was supported by ESRC grants to Professor Bas Aarts and Sean Wallis, who were both working at UCL during the research period. 

 From 2010\-2014 the SEU embarked on a new research project which uses the spoken and written English in the corpora to develop the *Englicious* website \( [www.englicious.org](http://www.englicious.org/)\) with the aim of helping teachers teach English grammar at primary, secondary and sixth form levels \[ **R2, R3**\]. Specifically, illustrative materials \(such as example sentences\) that are used in exercises, lessons, projects, etc. are taken from the corpora, which means that pupils work with authentic, age\-appropriate language materials, rather than artificial materials that do not appeal to them, as is often the case in printed textbooks \(‘The cat sat on the mat.’\). The corpus technology that was developed at the SEU allows the platform to source examples dynamically over the web. 

 The SEU’s publications based on this research contend that the teaching of grammar is at its most effective if it is taught using technology that young children are familiar with, such as smartphones, tablets and the internet \[ **R3**\], findings which have been applied to the development of both the *Englicious* website and *Grammar Practice Key Stage 2* mobile app \[ **R2**\]. Bas Aarts et al argue that grammar should be taught in a contextualised way, by making reference to engaging, age\-appropriate texts such as songs, poems and stories. They found, by testing *Englicious* materials in the classroom, that it is beneficial for children to see ‘grammar in action’ using interactive resources, and in that way to appreciate how authors create texts and make different grammatical choices that affect the meaning of a story, poem, etc. As an example, authors often re\-order sentence elements \(‘Chocolate I love’ instead of ‘I love chocolate’\) to highlight or emphasise particular units. The *Englicious* team has designed interactive resources that make children aware of this in a playful way \[ **R4**\]. The book *How to Teach Grammar* provides subject knowledge and a detailed description of this pedagogical rationale \[ **R5**\]. A chapter in *Applying Linguistics: Language and the Impact Agenda* has demonstrated how *Englicious* opens up new ways for linguistics academics to engage with and benefit learner communities outside of universities \[ **R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **English grammar in the National Curriculum: a problem area** 

 The 2014 National Curriculum for English requires the teaching of grammar in primary and secondary schools to a specialised level. Pupils must acquire “an understanding of grammar and knowledge of linguistic conventions”, including technical terminology such as *determiner, adverbial,* and *subjunctive*. There has been considerable discussion in the educational literature and the media about the difficulties that these new requirements pose for teachers, because many have never been taught grammar, and because they feel anxious about having to teach it. Bas Aarts publicised this issue, explaining in a *Times* article that the tests demanded more knowledge of grammar than many teachers possessed and that ‘many teachers feel uncomfortable with grammar and don’t know how to use it formally’ \(4 October 2013, circulation 391,643 at the point of publication\) \[ **A**\]. 

 The web\-based platform for English language teaching, *Englicious*, addresses the practical teaching and learning needs in schools. It uses authentic language materials which are sourced from the research databases \(corpora\) developed as part of SEU research – the ICE\-GB and DCPSE \[ **R1**\]. Aarts and Wallis and their team developed the platform \(with feedback from teachers at various stages\), and created guidance and teacher\-training materials, which were then tested in schools. *Englicious* makes available to schools a wide variety of innovative teaching materials \(lesson plans, interactive exercises, projects, videos, glossaries, etc.\), as well as subject knowledge for teachers \[ **R3**, **R4**, **R6**\], and it helps pupils and teachers to prepare for the Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling tests at primary level, and for GCSEs and A\-levels, where competent use of language is now part of the assessment. 

 **Provision of free resources supporting English language teaching and learning** 

 The number of users signed up to *Englicious* reached 15,000 in January 2021, over 10,000 of whom were teachers, around 2% of the total number of teachers in the UK \[ **B**\]. The number of annual page views grew from 216,000 in the first year to 457,804 during 2020. Google Analytics shows that the website has been used in 227 countries, predominantly the UK, Indonesia, India, the US and the Philippines \[ **B**\]. Our research results show that the use of *Englicious* has had a measurable impact on the community of schoolteachers using the platform. A survey of 56 users \[ **C**\] indicated that 94% of teachers like *Englicious* for its accuracy and its use of interesting and relevant examples. Teachers have used the site to support their lesson plans. 81.5% of respondents agreed that *Englicious* ‘gives me confidence in the classroom’, while 76% agreed that it gives students confidence in using grammatical language. 78% said that activities are engaging and interesting to students. Two focus groups comprised of Primary, Secondary and Further Education professionals found that teachers welcomed the link to the National Curriculum and highlighted the lesson plans as particularly useful for their teaching: “I like the *Englicious* link to the National Curriculum”; “I think the lesson plans are really useful. With my A\-level students they’re very, very useful ...”; “You’ve got \[a lesson plan\] on structure that I think is really good. And I thought to myself when I saw it, that’ll be brilliant for doing the structure question.” The site caters for children of all abilities. One teacher said: “I am currently using *Englicious* with a group of low attaining Year 7s. They love the activities, particularly those that require them to move words around on the interactive whiteboard. Thanks for creating this fantastic resource” \[ **D**\]. Fundamentally, the platform has empowered teachers, providing resources to support their professional practice by demystifying the subject: “Despite reading numerous grammar books over the years, I felt lost in a morass of unintelligible terms and rules until I found Englicious. It is not an exaggeration to say that I wept tears of joy and relief when I looked at the website for the first time. Now I love, rather than fear, grammar” \[ **E**\]. 

 *Englicious* supports teachers with printed materials linked to the website that are designed by the SEU team and with the app *Grammar Practice Key Stage 2* \[ **R2**\], both of which draw upon corpora \[ **R3**, **R4**, **R6**\]. Since July 2017, over 3,000 ‘knowledge organisers’, wall posters and flashcards summarising key National Curriculum grammar terms have been sold \[ **I**\]. The knowledge organisers can be used by teachers in their lesson delivery, and the posters and flashcards can be used as everyday reminders of grammatical terminology in the classroom. The income generated by these resources \(over GBP8,000 between July 2017 and July 2020\)  has been reinvested to help to support the *Englicious* website. 

 Aarts’s blog, *Grammarianism* \(launched 2015\) and podcast ‘Grammar Explainers’ \(launched on Soundcloud in 2019 and linked to from *Englicious*\) provide further free teaching and learning resources. The posts on the former discuss elements of grammar that are of specific interest to teachers of English. The blog had 97,890 views in 2020 and garnered comments that attest to its benefits: “As a year 6 teacher, I will be looking to your blog for answers again as it seems to be hard to find decent explanations\!” \[ **B**, **F**\]. The podcast episodes – six ‘Basic Explainers’ for NQTs and teachers with very little grammar training and nine ‘Advanced Explainers’ – provided bite\-size answers to common grammar questions, attracting over 6,000 listens between November 2019 and the start of 2021 \[ **G**\]. In addition, the book *How to Teach Grammar* \[ **R5**\] served as a valuable resource for teachers: a teacher confirmed, “I found this enormously engaging with dozens of inventive ideas to engage learners” \[ **G**\]. Aarts’ online video on grammar teaching is used at the UCL Institute of Education as part of its PGCE programme and can be freely viewed by anyone \(485 views by 8/1/21\) \[ **G**\]. @EngliciousUCL has 5,059 followers on Twitter \(8/1/21\) and users have frequently attested to the benefits of the resource in supporting teaching and learning: “@EngliciousUCL is my go\-to for all grammar related things \(plus has teaching resources\!\)”; “Take a look at the entry on determiners in the National Curriculum glossary. *Englicious* is, as always, very helpful on this too” \[ **F**\]. 

 **Building teachers’ professional capacity to teach grammar through CPD** 

 The *Englicious* team designed two Continuous Professional Development \(CPD\) courses which train teachers face\-to\-face \(and online since April 2020\): *English Grammar for Teachers* \(EGfT\) and *Teaching English Grammar in Context* \(TEGiC\). These have generated an annual income of GBP15,\-000 – 20,000, which has been reinvested in *Englicious*. Between August 2015 and summer 2020 approximately 700 teachers were taught at UCL or online, plus approximately 500 more in schools as In\-Service Training \(INSET\) days. *Englicious* courses have made a real difference in the way that teachers perceive grammar. Before taking the course they often view grammar negatively \(“Did not think that a lot would be taught to us”\). After the course they feel empowered to teach grammar in a new way – “This course exceeded my expectations: I thought I would just be taught how to use *Englicious* as a resource, but I was able to improve my grammatical knowledge too. I have improved my own knowledge of grammatical terms which will help me explain them to my pupils” – and inspired to bring new resources into their classroom: “I am going to re\-plan my schemes of work to include more starter exercises from the website” \[ **E**\]. Joanna Woodhouse \(Literacy Coordinator at a National Teaching and Support School linked with 35 Nottinghamshire schools\) attests to the value of *Englicious* grammar training being “based on robust research” and linked to the National Curriculum, describing the immediate impact on teachers: the session “gave us lots to take away for the classroom \[...\] we’ve all gone back into the classroom with more confidence”. Regarding the longer\-term benefits for embedding *Englicious* within CPD she notes: “I deliver training in schools so will be passing on the learning. I’ve now spoken to all staff and students in A level English language classes in our school and demonstrated *Englicious* as a resource so they’re all using it” \[ **E**\]. Aarts has also run seminars and workshops on the *Englicious* project, which have further contributed to teachers’ professional skills development, most notably at the 2014 and 2016 English Grammar Days at the British Library aimed at the general public and at teachers \(around 220 participants on each day\) and at the ResearchED Conference ‘English and Modern Foreign Languages’ at the University of Oxford in 2017. 

 **Informing English language assessment in primary schools** 

 Aarts advised the Department for Education on the compilation of the SATS tests as a member of a Test Review Group \(TRG\) in 2015 and 2019 \[ **J**\]. His input has resulted in changes being made to the questions on KS1 and KS2 tests to make them grammatically accurate, fair and do\-able. In the words of the DfE, the purpose of the TRG “is to allow senior or experienced teachers, subject or curriculum experts and markers \(as required\) to review and discuss the national curriculum assessments during their development, and to identify where the materials \(questions or mark schemes\) could be improved to better meet the purpose of the tests” \[ **J**\]. 

 The *Englicious* website and its offshoots \(printed resources, mobile app, blog, podcast, CPD courses and book \[ **R5**\]\), have therefore significantly enhanced English language teaching practice for thousands of primary, secondary and further education teachers in the UK and globally, directly and indirectly providing research\-based learning materials for students of all ages to improve their understanding of English grammar and its usage.

Emphasis on supporting multilingual communities in safeguarding and sharing their linguistic heritage has helped to strength local communities and aid the integration of refugee and other vulnerable minority groups. Impact in this topic has focused on developing language teaching tools which can be used in a range of contexts, whether it be aiding in second language teaching for students with SpLDs or creating international teaching partnerships to enable language mentoring. Case studies in this strand often participate in the preservation and recovery of native languages, particularly Gaelic. Welsh-language learning tools, often capitalising on the opportunity for crowdsourcing knowledge online, have made impressive strides in boosting public interest in Welsh learning.

 **1. Summary of the impact:** 

 *Blood: Uniting & Dividing* and *Jews, Money, Myth* are two major exhibitions hosted by the Jewish Museum London in 2015/16 and 2019. Both exhibitions attracted prominent collectors to open their collections and loan items. 

 *Blood* generated unprecedented critical acclaim, attracting over 11,000 people, selling over 600 exhibition books, and generating thousands of pounds in revenue. It toured to the Galicia Jewish Museum, Krakow, and the world\-renowned POLIN Museum for the History of Polish Jews, Warsaw. It had a profound impact in Krakow where, in order to host the exhibition, staff needed to develop new skills that hugely improved the capacity of the Museum. It was the most successful travelling exhibition they had ever hosted, with more than 30,000 visitors. At POLIN *Blood* attracted 45,000 people \(nearly double the museum’s target number\) making it the most popular temporary exhibition in POLIN’s history. 

 *Jews, Money, Myth* reached 290 million people through press and media, won the prestigious Museums Association ‘Museums Change Lives’ award 2019 and had a profound but positive impact on the approximately 22,000 thousand visitors at a time of rising antisemitism. It inspired follow\-up learning \(including an educational programme delivered directly to members of the Labour Party and via the TUC to its members\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research:** 

 Bale’s research has explored Christian ideas about Jews and Judaism, initially in his monograph study of late medieval English culture, *The Jew in the Medieval Book: English Antisemitisms 1350\-1500*<sup>1</sup>, which was awarded a Koret Foundation Jewish Studies Publications Program award and the 2006/7 Ronald Tress Prize. 

 Later research by Bale, much of which was undertaken as a Frankel Fellow at the Frankel Institute for Advanced Judaic Studies \(University of Michigan Ann Arbor\) interrogated violence and imagined persecution in late medieval European representations of Judaism. The resulting monograph *Feeling Persecuted: Christians, Jews and Images of Violence*<sup>2</sup> was awarded the 2011 Beatrice White Prize from the English Association. 

 Bale’s work with the Jewish Museum London also drew on his work on the post\-medieval public commemoration of the medieval Anglo\-Jewish community<sup>3</sup>. Bale received a  [Philip Leverhulme Prize in 2011](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Leverhulme_Prize) to support his ongoing research on medieval popular religion, and his 2016 Leverhulme Artist in Residence grant with animation director Shay Hamias on medieval manuscripts, developed his own curatorial skills<sup>5</sup>. 

 The *Blood* exhibition investigated literary and historical perspectives on the blood libel and Jewish\-Christian relations. Bale was invited to act as one of two academic advisors for this exhibition, specifically contributing his expertise on the medieval blood libel and ritual murder, circumcision, Shakespeare’s *Merchant of Venice,* medieval popular religion, and theories of antisemitism. The second academic advisor on *Blood* was Professor David Feldman, Director of the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism at Birkbeck. 

 The research also drew on Feldman’s research, for example his article on the Damascus blood libel affair of 1840: David Feldman ‘The Damascus Affair and the Debate on Ritual Murder in Early Victorian Britain’ in Sander Gilman \(ed\). *Judaism, Christianity and Islam: Conflict and Collaboration in the Age of the Diaspora*, Hong\-Kong University Press, November 2014 Chapter 7 

  

 This research is further elaborated in the exhibition booklet *Blood: Reflections on What Unites and Divides Us* \(London, 2015\) edited, with an introduction, by Bale and Feldman<sup>4</sup>. Bale also contributed a short piece on ‘Shylock’s Blood’ to this booklet. 

  

 Following on from the success of the *Blood* exhibition, Bale and Feldman were once again asked to collaborate with the Jewish Museum London on *Jews, Money, Myth*, together with Marc Volovici, also of the Pears Institute at Birkbeck. *Jews, Money, Myth* likewise drew specifically on Bale’s expertise in the medieval representation of Jews, the history of Judas Iscariot, and the role of the Anglo\-Jewish community in finance. Bale also contributed a ‘talking head’ video about Jews in medieval English society, that was integral to the exhibition. Bale and Feldman contributed to the accompanying book, edited by Volovici<sup>6</sup>. 

 Curator Jo Rosenthal confirmed Bale and Feldman were “fundamental to the success of both projects’ and “provided essential input into every stage of the exhibition’s development – the concept, themes, structure, narrative, display material. The publications that resulted from both exhibitions were largely the result of Birkbeck’s work” and “These are tremendously important elements of the exhibition’s legacy” \(item 5, section 5\)

 **4. Details of the impact:** 

 The Jewish Museum London is recognised by the Arts Council as an important museum ‘of strategic significance nationally’<sup>1</sup>. 

 In 2013, Bale and Feldman were approached by the museum to provide advice and expertise on ideas for exhibitions to tackle antisemitism, exploring its history and contemporary prevalence, and to transform public debate about 21<sup>st</sup> century Jewish culture. Two universal themes were selected, blood and money, resulting in the hugely successful exhibitions *Blood: Uniting & Dividing* \(between 05/11/ 2015 and 28/02/2016\)<sup>3</sup> and the award\-winning *Jews, Money, Myth* \- originally scheduled between 19/03/2019 and 17/07/2019, but extended to 17/10/2019 ‘due to popular demand’<sup>4</sup>. 

 *Blood* and *Jews, Money, Myth* stand apart in the museum’s programmes as thought piece exhibitions which dealt bravely with complex and uncomfortable subjects, both developed for adult audiences, and both framed around big ideas. 

 The ambition behind *Blood* led to significant rewards for the Jewish Museum London. It generated unprecedented critical acclaim with extensive positive coverage in national and international media including *The New Statesman*, *The Times*, *The Guardian*, *The* *Independent*, *Financial Times*, *The* *Lancet*, *Jewish News*, the Italian magazine *Cultura* and Danish newspaper *Kristeligt Dagblad* \(which featured an interview with Bale\). It inspired discussions on Radio 3’s *Free Thinking* programme, and Radio 4’s *Saturday Review* programme.<sup>6</sup><sup>a</sup> David Aaronovitch, in a double\-page review in *The Times*, focused on the deep truth the exhibition offered to our society, that ultimately ‘all of us have much the same blood and that very little actually divides us biologically or deterministically from each other. … It’s not often an exhibition in a smallish museum makes such a big point.’<sup>6b</sup>. *Blood* attracted over 11,000 people and sold over 600 exhibition booklets, generating thousands of pounds in revenue for the museum<sup>6c</sup>. In a highly innovative approach to public engagement, the NHS used the exhibition to attract new blood donors; a task of critical importance with donors having fallen by 40 per cent in the previous decade. This was the first time the NHS had set up a mobile unit as part of a museum exhibition<sup>6d</sup> and was a huge success with up to 60 people registering as donors<sup>6e</sup>. The NHS now has a website where organisations can request a blood donation point at their event \-  [Blood donor events \- NHS Blood Donation](https://www.blood.co.uk/news-and-campaigns/campaigns/blood-donor-events/). 

 The success of the exhibition led to its adaptation for the Galicia Jewish Museum, Krakow \(exhibited between 15/05/18 and 31/10/18\) and POLIN Museum for the History of Polish Jews, European Museum of the Year in 2016, where it ran between 12/10/17 and 29/01/18. 

 For POLIN, the exhibition was a new departure, being its first devoted to a subject that is universal and simultaneously deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and rituals. As in London, the exhibition at POLIN was hugely successful, seen by almost 45,000 people \(smashing the target of 25,000\), making it the most popular temporary exhibition in the Museum's history and attracting almost twice as many visitors as the second\-most popular show in the period 2016\-18. More than 3,800 people took part in concerts, film screenings, workshops for children and adults, lectures and 250 tours guided by curators. It was covered in 628 media pieces, with the advertising value equivalent of this reporting calculated to be \~£1.1million \(or GBP1,000,000\)<sup>7b</sup>. The Jewish Museum London and POLIN commissioned new work from prominent contemporary artists, Tom Piper and Alan Farlie, Bogna Burska, Dorota Buczkowska and Eliza Proszczuk, creating work and increasing exposure for both museums and artists. The POLIN exhibition featured the first showing of Anish Kapoor’s work in Poland<sup>7c</sup>. Bale spoke about his work with the Jewish Museum London at a conference for museum professionals, “Museums and their Publics at Sites of Conflicted History”, held at POLIN before the exhibition \( [Museums and Their Publics at Sites of Conflicted History](https://www.polin.pl/pl/museums-and-their-publics-sites-conflicted-history)\). 

 *Blood* similarly achieved critical success for the Galicia Jewish Museum and significantly enhanced the museum’s international reputation. In order to host the exhibition, staff developed essential new skills that hugely improved the capacity of the Museum. It was the first time they had taken on an exhibition featuring items over several hundred years and with such an international spread. This required cooperation with individuals and institutions across Poland and Europe, a logistical and financial challenge.. ‘We needed to learn a lot about displaying, taking care of, transporting and generally handling rare historical items.’ The exhibition ‘was important in terms of proving that we can handle complex, object\-based exhibitions.’ It was the most successful travelling exhibition they had ever hosted, with very positive reactions from the more than 30,000 visitors. It resulted in an increase in social media engagement, and enhanced their technique, experience, network and reputation.<sup>8</sup> 

 *Blood*’s tour in Poland was an important outcome for the Jewish Museum London, ‘garnering attention from the international Jewish museum community and generating confidence from funders and stakeholders’<sup>5</sup>. Its success was consolidated with *Jews, Money, Myth*, deemed by the Jewish Museum’s director, Abigail Morris, as the exhibition which ‘best exemplified’ the museum’s ‘philosophy’<sup>2</sup>. This also featured an ambitious artwork programme, with new commissioned pieces by Doug Fishbone and Turner\-prize winner Jeremy Deller, installations by Roee Rosen and Ryan Gander, alongside loans from Israel, Europe and North America and a rare appearance of Rembrandt’s first masterpiece *Judas Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver* \(1629\), lent from a private collection. 

 *Jews, Money, Myth* attracted approximately 22,000 people and was of sufficient importance to be covered in major global publications including the *New York Times*, *New York Review of Books*, *Die Welt*, and *The Times of Israel*, in addition to national media such as *The Times* and *The Guardian* and in specialist press \(e.g. *The* *Art Review\)*<sup>9a</sup>. It ‘reached 290 million people through press and media’<sup>2</sup> and numerous comments in the visitor book attest to its international appeal Daniel Finkelstein praised the expert job it performed in ‘weaving together modern political attacks with ancient prejudices, showing how the latter give rise to the former’, helping make sense of the simultaneous existence of antisemitism on both the far right and the far left. ‘Over the past year I have had many friends asking me to explain to them the origins of antisemitic prejudice and, in particular, how it could have spread to the left. The next time I’m asked I will recommend a visit to Jews, Money, Myth’<sup>9c</sup>. There is interest in the London show from museums in Brussels, Amsterdam, New York, Krakow, Warsaw and Sydney. Described by the judges as ‘brave, fascinating and timely’, it won the prestigious Museums Association Museums Change Lives award 2019. 

 At the point when these two exhibitions were initially planned, no\-one could have anticipated the renewed contemporary relevance that the issue of antisemitism would have by the time they were shown. Whilst the timing was completely serendipitous, both *Blood* and *Jews, Money, Myth* had a profound but positive impact on the tens of thousands of visitors at a time of rising antisemitism. 

 On the basis of the responses to these exhibitions, Birkbeck developed an educational short course on identifying and tackling anti\-Semitism, ‘Facing Antisemitism: Politics, History Culture’. The Labour Party was the first major institution to sign up. The TUC also enrolled select staff on the course, The TUC, with support from Birkbeck, has developed its own materials informed by the course which it will roll out to members.<sup>10</sup> Furthermore, Bale and Feldman were invited to contribute to the Runnymede Trust’s *Our Migration Story* project, with Bale contributing a piece about the poetry and life of a medieval Jewish poet, Meir of Norwich. *Our Migration Story* won The Royal Historical Society Public History Prize for Online Resources in 2018 and The Guardian University Award 2019 for Research Impact<sup>11a</sup>, and then informed discussions in Parliament<sup>11b</sup>. Bale was also invited to contribute to an episode of Channel 4s hugely successful ""Britain's Most Historic Towns"" which considered medieval antisemitism in Lincoln \(recorded 03/20; shown 11/20\)<sup>11c</sup>. 

 Overall, for Morris, ‘We have transformed the Museum and have become recognised for our outstanding, award\-winning exhibitions and education programmes’<sup>1</sup>.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Many Scottish town centres have been losing activities and vibrancy, leading to vacancy, decay and dereliction adversely affecting place and identity, economic activity and social inclusion and cohesion. Our research to provide solutions to reverse the decline of Scotland’s town centres has enabled: 

 **Impact 1:** the development of the Scottish Government’s place\-based renewal policy the Town Centre Action Plan, various Town Centre Funds \(GBP68,000,000\) and the Place Based Investment Programme \(GBP275,000,000\); 

 **Impact 2:** the leadership of the implementation of the Town Centre Action Plan through Scotland’s Towns Partnership \(viewed as exemplary in the UK\), which directly received GBP7,500,000 funding for demonstration, renewal and Covid emergency response projects; 

 **Impact 3:** the development of the public access data platform Understanding Scottish Places, leading to evidence\-based strategic planning and redevelopment at the town level. 

 These impacts have made significant contributions to reversing the decline of Scottish town centres, benefitting individuals, communities, businesses, and organisations. 
","
 **2. Underpinning Research** 

 Research at the University of Stirling has provided policy advice for the Scottish Government. In 2002 Sparks and Findlay \(with commercial partners\) evaluated the effectiveness of the main retail planning policy for town centres \( **R1**\). This evaluation suggested the development of a higher profile in policy for town centres. The research proposed policy revisions to promote town centres as efficient, competitive, and innovative locations, including a stronger requirement for town centre strategies and vitality/viability studies and the need for a place\-based policy encouraging flexibility. This research led directly to the revision of national policy. 

 In 2008 Sparks and Findlay undertook a review of policies to support a healthy retail sector and retail\-led regeneration in town centres for the Scottish Government. This research \( **R2**\) clarified the relationship of retailing, regeneration and town centres and encouraged policy to focus on the nature of places and towns rather than on retail alone. The research identified that the issue was not only a retail one, but rather a town or place\-based problem, requiring wider solutions. 

 Sparks’ research and thought leadership through Chairing the Centre for Scottish Public Policy’s Towns Group led to the Scottish Government appointing him to the 2012/13 National Review of Town Centres. The Review’s Report \( **R3**\) presented a road map for the reversal of town centre decline, based on six themes \(town centre living, digital towns, proactive planning, accessible public services, vibrant local economies and enterprising communities\) encompassed within two over\-arching principles \(Town Centre First and consistent and comparable town data\). This \(and other research **R4**\) led directly to the Town Centre Action Plan \( **Impact 1**\), the confirmation of Scotland’s Towns Partnership \(STP\) as the lead body on implementing towns policy in Scotland \( **Impact 2**\) and the development of the data platform Understanding Scottish Places \( **Impact 3**\).

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Reversing the decline of town centres depends on place\-based policies that take a holistic and collaborative approach \(see **R1\-4**\). Sparks’ research, leadership and expertise has developed and built on this core principle to enshrine it in Scottish Government policy and initiatives \( **Impacts 1\-3**\). Neil McInroy \(Chief Executive, Centre for Local Economic Strategies\) writes “Professor Sparks’ role in advancing progressive place making and local economic policy action with Scotland has been significant. From his core retail studies expertise, Prof Sparks can ‘join the dots’ and make connections with other agendas which serve to advance the praxis toward achieving vibrant, prosperous and just places” \( **S1**\). David Cowan, Head of Regeneration for the Scottish Government summarises this process: 

 “The research undertaken by Leigh Sparks led to his appointment to the National Review of Town Centres in 2012/13. The Scottish Government response to this \(the Town Centre Action Plan\) has proved highly successful and influential, including informing policy elsewhere in the UK. Much of this impact has been due to Professor Sparks’ leadership of Scotland’s Towns Partnership \(STP\). STP have proved an invaluable partner as the Scottish Government have implemented the Town Centre Action Plan and developed policies, actions and investments around Town Centre First, the Place Principle, Understanding Scottish Places and the Place\-Based Investment Programme. Professor Sparks \(and his research\) has had a major impact on policy, strategy and thinking around towns.” \( **S2**\) 

 **Impact 1: The Town Centre Action Plan** 

 In November 2013, the Scottish Government responded to the National Review of Town Centres \( **R3**\) by announcing its  [Town Centre Action Plan \(TCAP\)](https://www.gov.scot/publications/town-centre-action-plan-scottish-government-response/), which forms the core of its approach to revitalising Scottish town centres. TCAP progressed the Town Centre First Principle, utilised the leadership of Scotland’s Towns Partnership to drive forward thematic projects from the National Review \( **Impact 2**\) and helped fund and develop a unique towns data platform, Understanding Scotland’s Places \( **Impact 3**\). As **S2** \(above\) shows, Sparks and his research was essential to the development of the TCAP and the impacts it has had and that have stemmed from it. 

 **Town Centre First** 

 In July 2014 the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities \(COSLA\) agreed the  [Town Centre First Principle](https://www.gov.scot/policies/regeneration/town-centre-regeneration/), “marking a significant shift in public policy towards town centres” \( **S3a**\). The Principle encapsulates the core findings of the underpinning research, expanding the concept of town\-centre regeneration beyond the previously prevalent retail\-only approach. It brings together all public sector bodies, businesses, and communities under a shared banner of investment in town centres and was a milestone in broadening stakeholder understanding of what successful town centre regeneration requires. As an example, Aberdeenshire Council fully embedded Town Centre First into its policy and operations, for which it won a COSLA award in 2018. It then developed a Town Centre Toolkit to guide town centre projects and the use of GBP2,700,000 from the Government Town Centre Fund \(see Impact 2\) across ten projects \( **S4a**\). In Falkirk, the Council decided to build its new council buildings in the town centre as part of a major GBP43,500,000 mixed use development \( **S4b**\), reversing a prior plan to build out of town. 

 **The Place Principle** 

 In 2019 the Scottish Government and COSLA extended Town Centre First by adopting the  [Place Principle](https://www.gov.scot/publications/place-principle-introduction/) to overcome organisational and sectoral boundaries, encourage stronger collaboration and community involvement, and improve the impact of combined energy, resources and investment. The principle was established by partners \(including STP, see Impact 2\) to help develop clear visions for places. It promotes a shared understanding of place, and the need to take a more collaborative approach to a place’s services and assets to achieve better outcomes for people and communities. The Place Principle supports Scotland’s  [<ins>National Performance Framework</ins>](https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/). 

 **Place\-Based Investment Programme** 

 Arising from the Place Principle, the 2020 Programme for Government committed to establishing the GBP275,000,000  [Place Based Investment Programme](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2020/09/protecting-scotland-renewing-scotland-governments-programme-scotland-2020-2021/documents/protecting-scotland-renewing-scotland/protecting-scotland-renewing-scotland/govscot%3Adocument/protecting-scotland-renewing-scotland.pdf?forceDownload=true) \( **S5**\), linking and aligning place\-based funding initiatives and ensuring that all place\-based investments are shaped by the needs and aspirations of local communities. This programme will impact through four over\-lapping and inter\-connected approaches \( *Town Centre Action, Community Wealth Building, Community led Regeneration*, *20\-minute Neighbourhoods*\). 

 **Impact 2: Scotland’s Towns Partnership** 

 In 2014 the Scottish Government requested  [Scotland’s Towns Partnership](https://www.scotlandstowns.org/) \(STP\) to lead, drive and oversee the implementation and delivery of TCAP. STP had been formed from the Centre for Scottish Public Policy Towns Group and Sparks was asked to be its inaugural Board chair \(a position he still holds\) due to his research \( **R4**\), ongoing thought leadership on town developments in Scotland and role in the National Town Centre Review \( **R3**\). STP focuses and aligns TCAP work through its partners and members \( [membership of 250 organisations](https://www.scotlandstowns.org/our_members) as of July 2020\), working with all councils and most major Scottish organisations \(e.g. Development Trusts, Carnegie UK Trust, BT Scotland, Scotrail, Sustrans, YoungScot, Visit Scotland, TSB, Historic Environment Scotland, Zero Waste Scotland, SPEN\). STP’s leadership of TCAP was enabled by operating funding of GBP1,460,000, and approximately GBP2,000,000 for demonstrator projects between 2013 and 2020. In 2019 the Government introduced the GBP50,000,000  [Town Centre Fund](https://www.gov.scot/policies/regeneration/town-centre-fund/) which STP jointly administered, followed in 2020 by the GBP18,000,000 Towns Capital Fund. These funds in turn leveraged significant investment at local levels, as Douglas Reid, Leader of East Ayrshire Council testifies: 

 “The resources and support of Scotland’s Towns Partnership helped to create a renewed focus on towns which in turn assisted us in securing the £20m UK National Energy Research Demonstrator in Cumnock alongside the Ayrshire College, Council HQ, Halo Innovation Hub and substantial other regeneration investments in our key town of Kilmarnock, which won Scotland’s Most Improved Town Award in 2016.” \( **S6a**\) 

 STP’s small core team, directed by the Board \(which Sparks chairs and leads\) also leads activities to promote towns more widely including \(details at  [www.scotlandstowns.org](https://stir-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ls1_stir_ac_uk/Documents/REF%20Impact%20Case%20Study/www.scotlandstowns.org)\): 

1.  The establishment of a Parliamentary Cross Party Group \(CPG\) for Towns and Town Centres \(with STP as secretariat\) providing a regular parliamentary forum on towns \( **S6b**\). 

1.  An annual National Conference, National Towns Week, MSP Connectors Programme, training and learning events, advice to local organisations and councils and demonstration projects \(e.g. Digital towns \- Cupar, Sustainable towns \- Cumnock, Paisley Visioning\). 

1.  A web portal and central resource hub including significant towns tools \(e.g. the Towns Toolkit, the Place Standard\), which since 2015 to 2020 has been visited by 325,000 users with over 800,000 page views \( **S6c**\). 

1.  A strong media presence, such as  [regular supplements with *The Herald* newspaper](https://www.scotlandstowns.org/scotland_s_towns_series_with_sunday_herald) which generated a wider public awareness of towns issues, had Ministerial engagement and promoted specific towns \( **S6d**\). 

 As Phil Prentice, Chief Officer of Scotland’s Towns Partnership testifies: 

 “The work of Professor Sparks has positioned Scotland as a global leader in relation to policy and interventions for towns and smaller settlements. His Chairmanship of Scotland’s Towns Partnership and his University and commercial research, provided the Government and sector stakeholders with the confidence to drive this agenda forward.” \( **S6c**\) 

 The Scottish Government has recognised STP’s initiatives as key achievements \( **S3b**\) in pushing forward TCAP, providing leadership and collaboration across Scotland, improving public and professional understanding of the issues involved in town centre regeneration, and facilitating potential solutions. In 2018 the independent and influential  [*Grimsey Review 2*](http://www.vanishinghighstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GrimseyReview2.pdf) \(led by a leading ex\-retailer\), which examined the state of town centres across the UK, recognised Scotland’s pioneering research\-led approach to town centre regeneration leadership and collaboration, stating that because of the work of the STP and TCAP “Scotland leads the way” in the UK \( **S7a**. p.25\). Bill Grimsey reinforces Sparks’ research and leadership role within this: 

 “In large part thanks to Prof. Sparks essential leadership, and the solid research foundation this has brought, Scotland is leading the way across the four UK nations and globally on town\-centred focused holistic urban regeneration. The collaborative, research\-led approach in Scotland and the results that has produced, including the important TCAP and resultant initiatives like the Scotland’s Towns Partnership, has become a best\-practice model for others to follow. This informed the Grimsey Review 2 and the model is being replicated in England with the English High Streets Task Force and its implementation body the Institute for Place Management.” \( **S7c**\) 

 This was further reinforced \( **S7b.** p.5\) by the 2018 Timpson Report \(The High Street Report for the UK Government\) which noted “We were impressed by the work already done by Scotland’s Town Partnership”. STP’s leadership work has also been recognised internationally, leading to the World Towns Leadership Summit being hosted in Edinburgh in 2016 \( **S8**\). Informed by research, including **R4**, this developed the World Towns Framework \(WTF – **S8**\), which is being refined internationally before being brought back to Scotland in 2021 as part of the Urban Economy Forum/United Nations Habitat Day. 

 **Impact 3: Understanding Scottish Places** 

 The underpinning research \(particularly **R3** but also **R1\-2**\) identified the lack of comprehensive, reliable, and accessible towns\-based data. Sparks and Findlay collaborated with others to create Understanding Scottish Places \( [www.usp.scot](file:///C:/Users/Laptop/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/34ONP11D/www.usp.scot) launched 2015 by the then Minister\) \( **S9a**\). This novel and free to use data resource provides rigorously consistent and comparable data for towns across Scotland, enabling positive reflection by place managers and others on town assets and potential. It continues to open up new data sources for towns, encourage government and other providers \(e.g. with the Ordnance Survey on greenspace data \- **S9c**\) to make available town\-based data and helps town managers analyse the nature of their towns and thus strategic policy, direction and investment decisions. Since launch, Understanding Scottish Places has been visited by over 40,000 individual users. North Ayrshire Council’s use of USP and its Town Audits function won the Planning category award at the Scottish Awards for Quality in Planning 2017 \( **S9a\)**. The pioneering success of Understanding Scottish Places brought replication in Wales as  [Understanding Welsh Places](http://www.understandingwelshplaces.wales/en/), with Sparks being involved as an adviser in its development. As Jen Wallace, Head of Policy of Carnegie UK Trust testifies, the research and leadership of Sparks have been essential in this: 

 “Understanding Scottish Places was a collaboration brought together by Carnegie UK Trust involving the Centre for Local Economic Strategies \(CLES\), Scotland’s Towns Partnership, the Scottish Government and the University of Stirling. Leigh Sparks \(and his research\) was critical to the rigour and coherence of the approach to, and the data at, the heart of the project. This has opened up new data sources on towns in Scotland, underpinning strategies and policies for places. The success of USP led directly to an equivalent being developed and used in Wales \(Understanding Welsh Places, launched in 2019\), with Leigh Sparks providing research\-informed advice as this was developed for the particular Welsh circumstances and data.” \( **S9b**\) 

 **COVID\-response** 

 The role of towns, place and communities became increasingly significant in the COVID\-19 pandemic response. Given his research and expertise Sparks was appointed a member of the Scottish Government’s  [Social Renewal Advisory Board](https://www.gov.scot/groups/social-renewal-advisory-board/) by Cabinet Secretaries Campbell \(Communities and Local Government\) and Somerville \(Social Security and Older People\), to input on towns and place \(in Scotland Cabinet Secretaries are the Senior Government Ministers\). Campbell also appointed Sparks to Chair the  [Review of the Town Centre Action Plan](https://www.gov.scot/news/healthier-greener-town-centres/) to ensure town centres are fit for the post\-pandemic and climate emergency affected world.  [The Review was published on the 3<sup>rd</sup> February 2021](https://www.gov.scot/publications/new-future-scotlands-town-centres/pages/3/) and Sparks has been asked to present its findings to the UK, Welsh, and Irish governments. STP was asked by Government to lead on the GBP1,000,000  [Scotland Loves Local](https://lovelocal.scot/) campaign \(summer 2020\) to encourage spending in local towns, generating substantial national coverage with over 2,360,000 of Scotland’s population viewing campaign content. STP also led on the BIDs Recovery Fund \(GBP1,000,000\) and the Towns and BIDs Resilience Recovery Fund \(GBP2,000,000\) for the Government. The Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills \(Hepburn\) appointed Sparks to his  [Retail Strategy Steering Group](https://www.gov.scot/groups/retail-strategy-steering-group/) in December 2020 \(“this will examine retail through a place\-based approach to policy making”\). 

 **Summary** 

 Tangible and significant benefits to Scotland’s towns have resulted from Sparks’ work. As Neil McInroy \(Chief Executive, Centre for Local Economic Strategies\) states, “Across the body of work and activity where I have interacted with Professor Sparks \(notably the National Review, Scotland’s Towns Partnership and Understanding Scottish Places\), I know he has made a significant and enduring contributions to the local economic health and vibrancy of place” \( **S1**\). Aileen Campbell MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government testifies that the research and leadership of Sparks have been essential throughout the development and implementation of Government policy and in its impact in reversing the decline of Scotland’s town centres: 

 “The Town Centre Action Plan has led the way internationally in thinking about towns, and much of this has been implemented through the work of Scotland’s Towns Partnership \(STP\) on behalf of the Scottish Government. The success and theoretical foundation of the Town Centre Action Plan is due in no small part to the research and leadership of Professor Sparks over a sustained period of time. Towns and town centres are vital for Scotland’s society and economy and Professor Sparks’ impact on actions to improve towns in Scotland has been considerable. When, in 2020 given Covid, we needed someone to lead the development of a new vision for Scotland’s towns, building on this strong legacy, I had no hesitation in appointing Professor Sparks to the task. His research and thinking on towns and place also encouraged me to appoint him to the Social Renewal Advisory Board to help ensure social renewal and place are aligned.” \( **S10**\)

1.  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 As part of its continuing strategic commitment to research addressing issues in the areas of Living with Environmental Change and Community Resilience, UAL has supported researchers working with a range of contemporary challenges relating to the climate crisis. Ongoing impact has been achieved by demonstrating a role for fine art in the communication of these issues. Research has developed novel approaches that show the value of experiential cultural methods for grasping the complexity and urgency of an issue normally only communicated through scientific concepts. UAL’s practice\-based research in this field provides models of cultural practice that impact on individual attitudes, policymaking and cultural change through multiple partnerships and dialogues with public, professional practitioners and institutional audiences. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 UAL’s researchers in this field have collaborated with climate breakdown experts outside the University to engage with the complexities of climate literacy. This case study presents UAL’s fine art, practice\-based research in relation to its strategic objectives in the area of environmental understanding, concern and action. Researchers have worked with scientists, economists, anthropologists and others united in a common objective to address the climate crisis through collaborative and interactive actions. Together, **Cross**, **Orta** and **Wainwright** have formed an important grouping in the University’s externally focused work from the early 2000s. Key outputs that underpin the impact of this group are described below. 

 Based at UAL, Cape Farewell \(est. 2001\) is an artist\-led organisation that works to create an urgent cultural response to climate breakdown, through a series of groundbreaking artist and scientist expeditions to the Arctic. U\_N\_F\_O\_L\_D \(2010, curated by **Wainwright** and David Buckland, Cape Farewell Founder and Director\), exhibited the work of 25 artists, including **Orta** and **Wainwright**, who had participated in the Cape Farewell expeditions \(High Arctic, 2007 and 2008; Andes, 2009\). The project explored the physical, emotional and political dimensions of a world stressed by profligate human activity, its underpinning research offering a new thinking process through which artists recognised that, by creating a cultural shift, they could play an informed and significant role. \[2.1.\] 

 **Orta**’s *Antarctica World Passport* \(from 2008\) is an ongoing, participatory project that focuses on the question of what it means to be a world citizen today; audiences are invited to become members of a growing, interconnected, online community. Acknowledging the influence of the political aesthetics of Bartolomeo Pietromarchi, in which art is seen as a function capable of changing the way reality is looked at and interpreted, the research engages with issues of community, migration and mobility, shelter and habitat. A passport is not required to visit Antarctica—the 1959 Antarctic Treaty declared it a peaceful territory, free from country ownership. **Orta**’s World Passport is a symbol of what the world could be: a place where people move freely, take responsibility for their own actions and defend the human right to liberty and justice. Each visitor to the recurring *Antarctica World Passport Offices*, designed to resemble the remote border crossings around the world, receives a numbered Passport, and pledges to support the project’s principles: to take action against the disastrous effects of global warming, and to strive for peace. \[2.2.\] 

 *The Lost Horizon* \( **Cross**, 2003\) is a fantasy mountain landscape generated from financial data, made as a site\-specific work for the London School of Economics, using up\-to\-date Financial Times Stock Exchange data supplied by American Express, processed by software designed for creating fictitious landscapes. **Cross** used financial data to question the sustainability of financial practices at a corporate level and in our daily activities. *Lost Horizon* is the title of James Hilton's 1933 story of adventure and personal discovery in a remote continent during the last years of the British Empire. In the 2000s, the global trading landscape is one prefigured by resource exploitation and movement. **Cross**’ digression from the work of economists and financial analysts seems playful, yet, by wilfully misusing factual information, it offers insight into the relationship between socio\-economic power and cultural constructions of places as resources. \[2.3.\]

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Living with Environmental Change and Community Resilience are two of UAL’s key research themes, and the researchers in this case study have been deeply involved in work that supports these concerns. Collectively, they have created a body of work and new ways of thinking across the University that have impacted institutions and individuals worldwide, in particular, representatives of international organisations relating to policy change, including NGOs, representatives of government institutions, and members of the public, all of which have engaged with the issue of climate breakdown through the work presented in this case study. 

 By communicating complex issues around climate breakdown, often alongside scientific and economic information, **Wainwright**’s research highlighted its impact. The works he produced have been used extensively to make visible the effect of climate breakdown; probably best known in this relation are the images for *Red Ice–White Ice*. Building on his previous research disseminated through the U\-N\-F\-O\-L\-D project, in 2017 **Wainwright** curated and exhibited in *What Has To Be Done* \(Today Art Museum, Beijing, with support from the Beijing Culture & Art Fund and ThinkPad\). This art, environment and cross\-disciplinary project was based on four voyages convened by **Wainwright**, with artists, writers, collectors and filmmakers from Europe and China travelling around the Scottish Western Isles on a sailing ship, Lady of Avenel. The material exhibited at the Today Art Museum challenged artists across the world to continue to respond, to create powerful messages and to promote the role of art, and artists, as catalysts of environmental change. 

 Through this work, in 2015, UAL became a partner to the Nansen Initiative, which, in 2016, became the *Platform* on Disaster Displacement \(PDD\), a group of international states working together towards better protection for people displaced across borders due to climate breakdown and disasters. In the same year, representatives of 109 government delegations endorsed the Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda at the Nansen Initiative Global Consultation, which also included global organisations, NGOs and academics *.* At the conference, **Wainwright**—as curator—showed his own work alongside that of others \(including **Orta**\) in  [*DISPLACEMENT: Uncertain Journeys*](https://www.displacementjourneys.org/). This collaborative art project, originally created in partnership with the Nansen Initiative, now primarily supports PDD by curating art interventions that create opportunities to understand disaster displacement from a visual, experiential and emotional perspective. With its primary audience international policymakers rather than the general public, the project was developed with **Wainwright**’s leadership to introduce new insights and energy into the way disaster displacement is presented, discussed and understood in intergovernmental processes, introducing artistic forms of understanding and knowledge. 

 Co\-funded by the Norwegian Refugee Council \(NRC\), the project also led to an ongoing relationship with UAL; the University now has a collaborative PhD student with NRC, supervised by **Cross**. Following the tragic death of **Wainwright** in 2017, UAL, represented by **Orta** and **Cross**, remains on the PDD Advisory Committee, with DISPLACEMENT led by the PhD student \(Entwisle Chapuisat\) who co\-founded the project with **Wainwright.** UAL’s participation \(Baddeley\) in the PDD Advisory Committee Workshop in 2019 enabled the University to contribute to the development of the PDD communication strategy and underscore the relevance of artistic research to international policymaking processes. 

 With the inclusion by PDD of the *DISPLACEMENT* art project in its workplan, UAL’s research has continued to reach policymakers at international conferences. Migration Week in Marrakesh \(2018\) formed a particularly strong focus for UAL’s work \( **Orta** and **Wainwright**\), bringing together representatives from UN member states, international organisations and civil society organisations for two official events: the ‘11th Global Forum on Migration and Development Summit’ and the ‘United Nations’ Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration’. In particular, **Orta**’s *Antarctica World Passport Delivery Bureau* and *Antarctic Village—No Borders,* exhibited in the heart of the conference centre, attracted significant attention and curiosity amongst delegates, prompting personal exchange and conversation about the importance of placing disaster displacement within the formal discussions. **Orta** spoke alongside the Bangladeshi Foreign Minister and the French Consul General at a PDD event hosted at the French Residency. The *Antarctica World Passport Delivery Bureau* delivered the fifth edition of the passport to delegates and invited guests. This distribution saw the Mayor of Lampedusa, The Ambassador of Fiji, and the Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh signup. The communications officier of the International Organisation of Migration stated this was the most successful method of engagement to reach audiences that he had ever seen. Professor Walter Kälin, Envoy of the Chair of the Platform on Disaster Displacement: “ **Orta**’s work and presence in Marrakesh were crucial to keeping disaster displacement high up on the agenda of this overcrowded intergovernmental meeting with so many competing thematic priorities”. \[5.1.\] 

 First printed in 2008, **Orta**'s Antarctica World Passport is an internationally celebrated advocacy and social engagement tool that explores the underlying principles of the Antarctica Peace Treaty as a symbol of the unification of world citizens. There are currently six *Antarctica World Passport* editions in French, English, German and Russian totalling 72,000 examples. Further to the online component and the touring exhibitions, ten major Passport distribution events have been held. The eleventh and twelfth passport events were scheduled for 2020 and were postponed due to the pandemic. At 31 December 2020, the online database had over 31,000 citizens from across the globe, including some from the hardest hit catastrophe zones: The Philippines, Alaska, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Passport holders populate the ‘Citizen Map’, a delocalisation app portraying the collective distribution and strength of the project. \[5.2.\] 

 In 2015, *Antarctica World Passport Delivery Bureau* and *Antarctic Village* were installed in the Pavillon Sicli, Geneva, as an integrated cultural component of the Nansen Initiative Global Consultation. The exhibition was hosted by the Swiss Ambassador, the State Secretary of Norway and the Mayor of Geneva. Passports were delivered to all the 350 delegates present, who became members of the Antarctica World Passport community. The passport manifesto, *13.3*, was adopted by the Interior Minister of Iraq as an official governmental position to be put forward as part of the Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda. 

 The Geneva manifestation of the *Antarctica World Passport Delivery Bureau* was followed by an installation at the Grand Palais, Paris, during the ‘COP21 Climate Summit’ \(December 2015, funded by COAL and ArtCOP21, France\). Businessmen, entrepreneurs, indigenous peoples, activists, artists, government ministers, negotiators, journalists and lawyers signed up. Visitors to the installation included scientists working in the Arctic and Antarctic, the engineer of the Antarctic schooner Tara, the director of the Cousteau Society, who pledged to support a voyage to Antarctica for an Antarctic citizen, and the great granddaughter of the Antarctic explorer, Captain Scott. 

 Commissioned for group exhibition *Show me the money: the image of finance, 1700 to the present* \(2014\), **Cross**’ *Black Narcissus* \(2014\) takes the form of an artificial mountain landscape generated from financial graphs. The work builds on the 2003 work for the LSE, *The Lost Horizon,* but, with advanced technology, *Black Narcissus* uses terrain\-generating software for advertising and mainstream cinema to fuse the abstract profile of financial graphs with the illusory space of computer\-generated imagery. The rise and fall of trade in the vertical scale of the graphs emerges as steep gradients resembling rock faces, cliffs and ravines. The passage of time on the horizontal scale encompasses the historical period 2003–2013, with the landscape embodying a decade of trauma, chaos and revolution. Throughout 2014, *Black Narcissus* was exhibited in *Show me the money* \(with accompanying publication\) at Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art, Sunderland; Chawton House Library, Hampshire; John Hansard Gallery, Southampton and, in 2015/16, People's History Museum, Manchester. The work was described as a “standalone representation of *Show me the money*”. \[5.3.\] The power and pertinence of the image is demonstrated by its choice as the cover image for *The Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation* \(Oxford University Press, 2015\). \[5.4.\] 

 **Cross**’ ongoing activism within UAL includes campaigning for the University to divest from fossil fuels, adopt Science\_Based Targets for achieving Zero Carbon Emissions, and connect decarbonisation with decolonisation. \[5.5.\] **Cross** set the historical and theoretical framework of the joint UAL/Horniman Museum participatory event *Climate Crisis: Speculative Futures* \(2020\) *.* The event involved students, staff and the wider public, and launched a strategic partnership to promote knowledge exchange and build on common interests, following UAL’s commitment \(September 2019\) to place decarbonisation at the heart of the University’s academic offer. \[5.6.\] 

 UAL has developed relationships with institutions engaged in issues around environmental crisis, such as the British Antarctic Survey and Cape Farewell. Through its international Art for the Environment Residency Programme \(AER, est. 2015\), UAL has partnered with institutions in countries including Canada, Italy, India, Mexico, Senegal and the UK. While the initiative places UAL students in residencies in relation to their studies, the institutions recognise the impact that it has on their own work. AER’s first partnership, Yorkshire Sculpture Park \(YSP, partner since 2016\): “Fostering a greater connectedness to nature and understanding of our surroundings, through projects such as the AER residencies involving close and careful looking, research and analysis, is critical.” Labverde \(partner since 2017\), an arts agency based in the Amazon that brings together art, science and communities: “On an international level, the \[Environment Residency Programme\] partnership is an opportunity for us to exchange knowledge in a global context, collaborating with a highly qualified team in the artistic field to co\-develop solutions for environmental justice.” Banff Center for Arts and Creativity \(partner since 2017\): “\[The Environment Residency Programme’s\] connection to environmental concerns prepares artists to be conscientious citizens who will make a difference to the future of our planet—a goal that aligns with Banff Centre’s strategic plan and location within a UNESCO World Heritage Site.” \[5.7.\] 

 The University has strengthened this field of research further through the appointment of researcher and artist, Professor Tom Corby \(UAL Associate Dean: Research, 2018\). Corby’s practice\-based research explores climate breakdown, extractivism and geographies of conflict, taking the form of large\-scale screen and physical installations, articulating and making tangible relationships between social, political and technological worlds. *Northern Polar Studies* is a large\-scale, screen\-based installation, which uses datasets from drifting buoys and satellite measurements of Arctic sea ice. This data has been used to model the retreat of the Arctic going back the 1980s by examining the age and distribution of sea ice. Since joining UAL, Corby has achieved AHRC funding to pursue this research. \( *Materialising Data Embodying Climate Change*, 2019–2021, with researchers from the British Antarctic Survey and Birkbeck College, University of London, GDP705,588.00, PI: Corby\), which asks how the production of artworks from ‘factual data’ offers new possibilities for representing climate breakdown. Corby is also UAL lead and creative partner in the Horizon 2020\-funded ‘Deepice Consortium’ *,* led by Centre national de la recherche scientifique. The project addresses major scientific questions on the role of ice sheet size and greenhouse gas concentrations on the dynamics of past climate changes.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 East Asia is widely known for its economic dynamism and success but it is also a region of great power rivalry and unresolved territorial disputes. The existing research tends to focus on the material dimensions of international relations such as military competition and economic rivalry, which fails to explicate the persistence of tensions among major East Asian countries despite their close economic interactions and trade relations. The project addresses this research problem by investigating the important role of identity discourse and identity tensions in shaping their changing security relations. The research has stimulated and contributed to policy debates on East Asian security within governments and the diplomatic circles in the UK, Europe and East Asia. The key researcher’s contribution to these debates has led to a greater understanding of identity politics in conflict prevention and peace promotion among diplomats and foreign policy\-makers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 This research is undertaken and led by Professor Rex Li, Professor of International Relations at Liverpool John Moores University. It began in the late 1990s as part of an ESRC\-funded project on the post\-Cold War security environment in the Asia\-Pacific region, which was later developed into a major project on the rise of China as a great power and its regional and global implications. Since the mid\-2000s, with funding from various sources, including the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences, the project has extended its analysis of China to other East Asian countries, focusing in particular on the role of identity in conflict prevention and peace promotion in East Asia. East Asia is an economically dynamic and vibrant region, which has extensive trade and economic links with the countries around the world. However, it is also a region where there are traditional rivalries, unresolved disputes and potential conflicts. Specifically, this project has investigated how security relations in the region are shaped by changing identity discourses among the key players, including China, Japan, the United States and Korea. Building on the Project Leader’s previous research, the project examines the intricate links between recent tensions in the region and the process of identity construction in these countries that reflects their historical memory and future aspirations \(UR1\). 

 This project challenges the assumptions of Realist theory that are ingrained in the study of international relations by offering a cultural analysis of international relations. It argues that the roots of the volatile relationships among Japan, China, America and Korea lie in their changing self\-identity and perceived identity of each other. The project takes a Constructivist perspective that focuses on how the national identities of these countries are \(re\)defined and \(re\)constructed, and how their changing identity discourses are linked to their foreign policies and security strategies \(UR3, UR4, UR6\). In addition, the research has investigated how America and China have exploited their adeptly constructed narratives of the international order to enhance their discursive power in East Asia \(UR6\). The project adopts an interdisciplinary approach drawing on the theoretical insights of International Relations, Media and Communication Studies, Social Psychology and Sociology \(especially Social Identity Theory\) \(UR1, UR2, UR3, UR4, UR5, UR6\). Utilising qualitative research methods underpinned by interpretivism, the primary research includes a discourse analysis of government statements, official speeches, policy reports and news articles in English and several East Asian languages. This is supplemented by interviews with policy elites, officials and diplomats. The research outputs have made a unique contribution to the literature and existing knowledge in Cultural Studies and International Relations \(UR2, UR5, UR6\). 

 The project has significant policy relevance, as tensions and conflicts among East Asian countries would have a detrimental impact on the regional economic and security environment \(UR3, UR4, UR5, UR6\). The key research insights of this project indicate that China, Japan, the US and Korea perceive each other’s efforts to construct a potent national identity as a challenge to their own identity formation. This has also led to an intensification of a discursive rivalry between the US and China \(UR3, UR4, UR5, UR6\). The research concludes that whether peace can be maintained in the region will to a considerable extent depend on how serious the East Asian identity tensions are and whether and to what extent they may be reduced \(UR2, UR5\). The research suggests that these countries would have to make a serious attempt to escape from their ‘identity dilemma’. If perception is socially constructed, it may be altered via the development of intersubjective knowledge, ideas, norms and institutions. Another significant research insight is related to the psychological dimension of identity construction, in that these countries need to learn to appreciate the sensitivity of historical memory and accommodate each other’s distinctive national identity and national aspirations. Only then would they be able to build sustainable mutual trust and develop a more positive relationship \(UR1, UR2, UR5\). 

 As the UK and Europe have extensive economic and trade relationships with East Asia, it is in their interest to promote a stable and peaceful environment in the region. One of the major research recommendations is that Western analysts and policy\-makers need to monitor East Asian powers’ identity discourse and competing narratives closely, which has been changing substantially \(UR4, UR5, UR6\). East Asian leaders should be persuaded that the economic vitality of the region will rest on their willingness and ability to maintain a peaceful security environment \(UR1, UR5\). Meanwhile, the UK and other European countries should seek to instil positive influence into East Asian identity and security thinking wherever possible through all the available political and diplomatic channels \(UR1, UR2, UR5, UR6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research project is essentially concerned with gaining a thorough understanding of the self\-identity of the key East Asian countries \(China, Japan, the United States and Korea\) and their discourse of each other’s identities. The findings of the project indicate that the policy elites in these countries tend to perceive each other’s identity construction as a major challenge to their own identity. Their responses to the foreign and security policies of other countries are driven largely by a re\-evaluation of their self\-identity and the identity of their perceived competitors. This changing identity discourse is of direct relevance to preventing conflict and maintaining peace in East Asia. In addition, a sound understanding of the security dynamics in East Asia is important to Western governments, including the British government, in formulating their policy towards East Asia, given the growing significance of the region in international affairs and international trade. 

 The links between Professor Rex Li and the British foreign policy communities were established initially in the late 1990s through his ESRC\-funded research projects, which involved policy advisors and officials of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) and Ministry of Defence \(MoD\). Through various international collaborative projects, his contacts with the policy communities have extended from the UK to other European countries \(e.g. Belgium, France, Norway and Sweden\) and Asian countries \(e.g. China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam\). Professor Li’s reputation and status in the field of East Asian security have grown substantially during the last twenty years. He has been regularly invited to give presentations derived from his research at leading foreign policy think\-tanks. 

 **This section has been redacted** 

 In conclusion, the impact case study has demonstrated that the impact derived from this research project has reached a wide range of groups of beneficiaries in the diplomatic, foreign and security policy communities in the UK, Europe and East Asia. While the nature of the impact activities is highly sensitive with most events being held behind closed doors, the evidence provided has clearly confirmed the importance of the Project Leader’s involvement in these high\-level meetings, and its significant impact on enhancing and enriching the beneficiaries’ understanding of the role of identity in shaping foreign policy discourse and preventing conflict in East Asia.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Liverpool\-devised method of diabetic retinopathy \(DR\) eye screening, as used in England’s national programme, has been adopted internationally.  It has been introduced and implemented as national programmes in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Northern Ireland.  In these countries, all diabetic patients are now eligible for eye screening, and sight\-correcting/\-saving treatment as needed.  Bangladesh trialled the approach recently, and recommended implementation.  In Europe, guided by the Liverpool Declaration, most countries have improved DR screening provision. 

 Liverpool’s work on switching from annual to longer intervals, for more affordable DR screening, has widely informed programmes.  In the UK, our research was pivotal to a UK National Screening Committee recommendation \(2016\) to the national programme to lengthen DR screening to 2\-yearly for low risk people.  Liverpool’s unique evidence on personalised variable\-interval risk\-based screening \(2019, 2020\), is guiding NHS implementation in England.  Scotland adopted the recommendation for extended screening, which is planned in other countries. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

  

 Diabetic retinopathy \(DR\) is a disease in which the retina is damaged by high and abnormally varying levels of blood sugar associated with diabetes.  It is present in 40% of diabetes mellitus \(DM\) patients and is associated with significant morbidity.  Worldwide it is the leading cause of blindness among working age people.  When identified in its early\- to mid\- stages, DR can be treated effectively by laser and other interventions. 

  

 The Liverpool Diabetic Eye Study is a long\-running collaborative research programme led by Liverpool’s Departments of Eye and Vision Science \(Harding, Broadbent\) and Diabetes and Endocrinology \(Vora\), working to promote early DR detection.  Tackling the issue among the local Liverpool population \(initial work through to 2001\), the group developed and tested a model of systematic screening for DR comprising two\-field mydriatic digital photography using fundus cameras, captured and graded by purpose\-trained technicians.  This Liverpool approach showed superior performance to the previous standard, and cost\-effectiveness was demonstrated \(Younis et al, 2003; James et al, 2000 \(3.1, 3.2\)\). 

  

 Between 2000 and 2003, our preliminary research was furthered and refined, with a view to UK\-wide implementation.  Key contributions included: a grading method for severity of DR as captured by retinal photography; technician\-training resources; planning advice and work on screening intervals \(Harding et al, 2003 \(3.2\)\).  This work defined the DR screening approach that was introduced for the UK from 2003, with full implementation by 2008.  Since 2011, UoL research has continued to refine elements of the programme, through input into the English National Diabetic Eye Screening Programme \(ENDESP\) grading, training and research committees, and the national association of retinal screeners. 

 Our work on screening intervals has demonstrated increasing importance in recent years.  This addresses how frequently patients should be screened, for optimal balancing of health gains, programme costs and patient experience.  The Group’s work showed that a 3\-year screening interval should be considered in patients with no DR \(Younis et al, 2003 \(3.1\)\). 

 From 2011, Liverpool has extended work on this theme, to explore a personalised approach.  The Group’s RCT evidence has shown that an “individualised variable\-interval risk\-based” approach, calculated through complex mathematical modelling, is safe, effective and offers substantial improvements in cost\-effectiveness \(Harding et al, 2017, 2020 \(3.4, 3.5\). 

 A unique and complementary strand of this work, completed through interdisciplinary collaboration with Liverpool social scientists \(led by Prof. M. Gabbay\), has examined DM patient acceptability/behaviour of changes to screening intervals \(Byrne et al, 2020, \(3.6\)\).  This research is filling a significant evidence gap, crucial to policy decisions about implementing more cost\-effective screening for large groups of the DM population.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Diabetic retinopathy \(DR\) is the leading cause of vision loss among working age people.  It is a key complication of diabetes, affecting 1 in 3 persons with diabetes mellitus \(DM\).  With DM increasing globally \(WHO estimates 463,000,000 in 2019 rising to 578,000,000 by 2030\), DR is a global medical issue; vision loss is of enormous consequence for the individual, family and society, with significant economic costs.  WHO estimate that 64,000,000 people in the European Region have diabetes of whom 950,000 have vision impairment or blindness due to diabetes. 

 Liverpool is at the forefront of addressing this challenge, through its efforts towards advancement of early detection of DR.  Early detection halves the risk of blindness.  The ENDESP was an early outcome of our work \(REF2014 impact case\).  How that programme has rewritten the story of DR in England has now received international recognition, being highlighted in the WHO World Vision Report 2019 \(5.1\).  Since that ground\-breaking work the impact of our research has expanded importantly as follows: 

 **Implementation of national DR screening programmes internationally, following the England model** 

 The England model has now been fully implemented in a further three countries, with the success of the England case highlighted in the rationales for their implementation.  Australia announced its national screening programme in July 2018, with coverage of 1,200,000 people \(5.2\).  Only half that number were covered by previous provisions.  Initial government investment of AUD1,000,000 \(07\-2018\) for year one, was matched by Specsavers, who also pledged a further AUD4,000,000 \(07\-2018\).  Hong Kong and Singapore progressed to full implementation of their respective national, systematic photographic screening programmes, by expanding to further polyclinics and GPs \(5.3, 5.4\).  The Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Programme \(SiDRP\) covers 600,000 people, and achieves a saving of USD173 \(12\-2016\) per patient compared to the previous approach; 92% of patients found SiDRP more convenient than the previous model \(5.4\).  Harding worked directly with policymakers and clinicians to inform implementation. 

  

 Beyond these countries, trialling of systematic DR screening was undertaken in Bangladesh, as a feasibility study, inspired by the England programme and followed the England model, e.g. using Harding’s grading system.  In total, 49,264 patients were screened \(5.5\).  Sight\-saving surgery \(vitrectomy\) was performed in 309 patients; a further 3077 treatments for correction of visual impairment were undertaken.  A recommendation for urgent upscaling of the service was made. 

  

 In Europe, countries have made significant progress with DR screening implementation, working towards the Liverpool Declaration 2005 \(a target of 80% DM population eye screening\).  The latest meeting \(Manchester 2016 \(5.6\)\) of the group of European policymakers and clinicians that Harding established and convenes \( [www.drscreening.eu](http://www.drscreening.eu/), 2005\), for sharing best practice and disseminating latest research findings, gathered 40 national representatives.  The progress report highlights include: a\) Hungary’s introduction in 2013 of a Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme, covering 13 areas of the country and involving 4 universities.  Negotiations with the Ministry of Health for a fully\-funded national programme are in progress; b\) in Republic of Moldova results of a rapid review of DR reported in 2014, in which 3877 people were examined, using Harding’s grading system \(5.6\).  Harding, and other members of the Liverpool Group support such efforts through international conferences \(EASDec, EASD, DUK\), personal contact, visits, meetings and workshops. 

 WHO Europe, in 2020, commissioned Harding and Broadbent to the writing group of ‘Diabetes Eye Screening – A Guide for Europe’, and a situational analysis on screening \(5.7\).  These provide key information for policymakers in 56 countries in the WHO European Region.  Liverpool publications are cited in national DR guidelines in Finland \(2014\), Netherlands \(2017\), Sweden \(2018\) and Spain \(2019\).  The Liverpool work on cost\-effectiveness is cited in guidelines for Portugal \(2015\). 

##  Further impact in the UK: the Northern Ireland ‘internal control’ 

 Whereas systematic DR screening was taken\-up by the other three home nations in the 2000s, Northern Ireland did not implement the approach.  By 2010, DR in England and Wales had fallen to the 4<sup>th</sup> most common cause of blindness in working age people, and since then the rate of sight loss caused by DR has continued to fall from 3.5 per 100,000 to 3.1 in England.  In Northern Ireland, DR remains the most common cause of vision loss. 

 Observing this trend and contrast, Northern Ireland is quickly moving to closer compliance with the recommended UK approach, following Liverpool’s underpinning research.  Full adoption of national, systematic screening for DR began in 2016.  The 2016/17 programme report \(5.8\) points to the large amount of previously undetected DR, now being identified through alignment with the England model: of 45,845 people attending in the first year of systematic screening, 946 \(2.06%\) were referred urgently for treatment of advanced disease.  That rate is 5 times higher than in same period in Liverpool.  This has continued in the last 2 years. 

  

##  Extending screening intervals for affordable delivery of DR systematic screening 

 Liverpool’s research also played an important role in guiding a UK National Screening Committee recommendation \(19 January 2016\) that extended intervals from annual to 2\-yearly for low\-risk patients should be implemented \(5.9\).  Scotland adopted the recommendation \(5.10\), as has NHS England \(23 September 2020\) \(5.10\).  Liverpool’s robust data from 2020 \(3.5\) adds to this, showing that individualised variable\-interval risk\-based screening, as developed by us \(the next step beyond simple 2\-yearly screening for low risk patients\), would release GBP23,900,000 from screening if implemented in England alone. 

 This very substantial improvement in cost\-effectiveness will allow repurposing of funds to low income and hard to reach groups and help to mitigate against the increasing prevalence of diabetes.  For society as a whole this is an even higher impact at GBP31,900,000. 

 Liverpool’s unique work on patients’ behaviour within an extended interval scenario is part of the evidence base that the UK National Screening Committee notes will prove decisive to the England decision \(5.9\).  Extended intervals or variable intervals, with support of Liverpool research on that theme, have been introduced in Armenia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Spain, Sweden \(5.7 *\).*

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) into neural machine translation \(NMT\) has produced a pioneering translation toolkit, which has been widely adopted for commercial and public service use. The software, named Marian, uses the UoE’s novel *byte pair encoding* \(BPE\) and back translation techniques to increase existing machine translation capabilities to include niche vocabulary and unusual words. It was made open source in 2016, and has since been adopted by Microsoft to underpin the Microsoft Translator embedded translation services, and by specialist translation companies such as Lingo 24. It also formed the foundation for the software WIPO Translate, which is used by WIPO, a United Nations \(UN\) agency that verifies patents for the UN’s 192 member states.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Researchers at the University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) pioneered neural machine translation \(NMT\): the use of end\-to\-end neural network models for large\-scale machine translation. During 2015 – 2016 the UoE team developed a number of technical innovations which resulted in NMT becoming the preferred approach to machine translation both in research and in practical applications. 

 The first innovation addressed the issue of ensuring that NMT systems could translate languages with very large vocabularies, including rare words. The UoE team introduced the approach of *byte pair encoding* \(BPE\) which enables effective language modelling at the sub\-word level \[3.1\]. BPE enables infinite vocabulary sizes to be modelled using a finite set of sub\-words, and results in significant improvements in translation quality. This unsupervised method is language independent, which makes it easy and quick to apply to any language. This extremely highly cited work is now the standard approach for language representation in machine translation and has been used widely in other areas, for example speech recognition. 

 A second innovation addressed the problem of training NMT systems with data from only a single language. Training machine translation systems requires parallel source and target language texts. For many language pairs there is a relatively small amount of such parallel data, although there may be extensive data from either or both of the individual languages. The UoE team introduced a monolingual technique, *back\-translation*, which enables target language data to be used when training NMT systems, without the need for parallel source language data \[3.2\]. Back\-translation is of particular use for less well\-resourced language pairs, and again has become a standard approach in NMT. 

 A third innovation addressed the need for NMT systems to handle correctly issues such as capitalisation, numbers, and dates. The UoE team introduced a *factored representation* for NMT \[3.3\], based on linguistic features, which enables the system to learn such information in a compact and efficient way. Again, this has become a very widely used technique. 

 These three innovations were integrated in number of systems developed by the UoE team, and released as open source software. In 2016, the UoE team used their NMT systems for the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation \(WMT\) international evaluation of MT systems \[3.4\], which includes the major research teams in the area. The UoE systems were the most accurate in 7 out of 8 language pairs, often by a significant margin. This was the first time that neural models had conclusively beaten previous statistical machine translation models across a variety of language pairs. 

 The open source Nematus \[3.5\] and subsequent Marian \[3.6\] toolkits, developed by the UoE team, provide efficient implementations of NMT models and algorithms, including BPE, back\-translation, and factorised representations.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The research resulted in the software toolkit Marian, which was made open source on Github in 2016, with an updated version released in November 2017. Marian has proved extremely adaptable in practice, and has demonstrated positive effects on a wide range of organisations, meeting very different needs. 

 Its most high\-profile commercial adopter is Microsoft. In 2019, Microsoft blogged about adopting Marian to underpin the full range of the company’s embedded translation tools \[5.1\], which include those in Outlook, MS Word and Office 365. That year alone, the applications employing Marian reached a combined user base of 380,000,000 \[5.2, para. 15\]. 

 Marian’s novel features – specifically the BPE and back\-translation features – have enabled far more language pairs available for instant translation on the Microsoft platforms than previously possible, currently more than 70 \[5.3\]. Microsoft has publicly called Marian “one of the most efficient NMT toolkits available” \[5.1, para. 21\], directly citing four of the UoE papers on its blog, and elaborating on the specifics of how Marian has enhanced its applications. According to Microsoft, Marian is extremely efficient, not requiring GPUs during translation time, and is “very efficient at training time. Due to its self\-contained nature, it is quite easy to optimize Marian for NMT specific tasks” \[5.1, para. 20\]. As evidence of the importance to Microsoft of its translation tools, for its Christmas 2019 advert, the company chose to focus on Microsoft Translator as a flagship product \[5.4\]. 

 The uptake by Microsoft demonstrates the broad commercial reach of Marian, as it has been tailored for speedy use by general users. Significantly, Marian has also improved the translation capabilities for specialist translation companies. This is evidenced through its adoption by Lingo 24, and its targeted use at the UN’s WIPO. 

 Lingo 24 is the UK’s third\-largest translation company, with an annual turnover of approximately \[text removed for publication\] \[5.5, para. 1\]. Since 2018, it has used Marian in bespoke translation services for a variety of clients, and confirms that “the switch from our previous systems to Neural MT using Marian has generated a marked increase in MT quality” \[5.5, para. 4\]. This improvement in the quality of MT has enabled the company to increase the percentage of revenue generated by MT\-based work, from \[text removed for publication\] in 2018 to \[text removed for publication\] in 2019. Marian’s high performance on CPUs – negating the need for more expensive GPU hardware – additionally saves the company money \[5.5, para. 6\]. 

 Lingo 24 has been able to pass these benefits onto their various clients. In some cases clients whose services have been provided through Marian have “gained a market advantage…being able to release products more quickly” \[5.5\]. In the case of one distributor of home electronics, faster translation enabled the company “to reduce their time to market … allowing them to grow international revenues from \[text removed for publication\] to \[text removed for publication\]” \[5.5, para. 7\]. Lingo 24 is also explicit in crediting to Marian increased orders from customers due to better performance and faster turnaround \[5.5, para. 8\]. 

 In public service, the UN and the US Airforce are among the agencies to have adopted Marian. The US Airforce has credited “Marian's ease of use and high performance” in processing non\-English video, transcriptions of speech, and translation of documents \[5.6\]. The UN uses Marian through its WIPO agency, an organisation tasked with protecting intellectual property across the UN’s 192 member states. WIPO deals in complex patents, written in legalese, and uses technical vocabulary. It runs a database named PATENTSCOPE, which contains 91,000,000 patent records \[5.7\]. 

 Marian enabled WIPO to build its own in\-house translation tool, WIPO Translate, which has led to increased accuracy of patent translation, to a level that beats its commercial competition \[5.8, paras. 2\-4\]. The Marian\-based WIPO Translate is also used as the instant translator for PATENTSCOPE, allowing inventors and patent offices to translate previously filed patents from and to 14 language pairs, at rapid speed \[5.9, p. 9\]. 

 Marian generates a more natural word order when translating between so\-called ‘distant’ language pairs, such as English and Chinese. Currently, more than 50% of worldwide filings for patents are in Chinese, Japanese or Korean \[5.8, para. 5\]. 

 In a 2016 article, WIPO’s former director\-general confirmed that WIPO Translate “outperforms any other technology for translating the complex language used in patents” \[5.8, para. 1\]. These claims are supported by the BLEU scores of WIPO Translate, which have topped Google Translate in at least 18 language pairs \[5.10, p. 3\]. This means that WIPO is not reliant on an external provider for quality translation services, but can instead rely on their in\-house tool which was enabled by UoE research. 

 WIPO Translate has been so well\-received at the UN that other agencies have adopted it too, including the World Trade Organisation. WTO’s Director of Languages states: 

 *WIPO Translate plays an important role supporting multilingualism at WTO, allowing Secretariat staff to quickly comprehend texts which cannot be translated by humans due to resource constraints. Thanks to the great progress made in the quality of machine output, WIPO Translate is also increasingly called on by translators as an important tool in their toolbox.* \[5.11\] 

 The benefits Marian has brought to machine translation are evidenced by the swiftness of the software’s uptake by those in the translation field, and by the variety of translation uses to which it has been put. It has been adapted to fill a vast range of modern translation needs, from global public service organisations, to mainstream quick\-translation apps, and specialist translation agencies. Its impact as a tool has been both significant and far\-reaching.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Jason Cabañes’ research into digital, ‘networked disinformation’ \(a state\-sponsored model of covert political campaigning via fake news and trolling, facilitated by exploiting workers in the creative industries\) in the Philippines has led to two sets of public impact: 

-  It has raised the country’s awareness of networked disinformation, stimulated debate among lawmakers, policy\-makers and publics, and shaped new proposed laws on electoral fairness and political transparency. 

-  It has also benefited a range of organisations concerned with democracy, including third\-sector groups, by providing a basis for their research informing the formulation of policies to address the rise of networked disinformation across social media. This collaborative work with third\-sector and other organisations has also led to Cabañes’ research acting as a model for combating global networked disinformation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cabañes’ research demonstrated how online disinformation has proliferated, in spite of global attempts to counteract it. His research was initially conducted as part of the Digital Labour Research Stream of the NewtonTech4Dev Network, a British Council\-funded network aimed at advancing research on digital technologies in low\- and middle\-income countries. The research published out of this research, which was conducted during Cabañes’ time at Leeds, argued that understanding how disinformation is ‘networked’ is essential to understanding its power. It sought to provide sociological explanations for the phenomenon of online political trolling in the Philippines, and to assess whether and how this trolling plays a role in fostering a democratic media in the country \( **1, 3**\). Cabañes’ research showed that digital disinformation is more systemic than individual, often led by advertising and public relations executives, who assemble ‘click armies’ of celebrity influencers, anonymous digital influencers, and community\-level fake account operators to fulfil the objectives of their clients – usually politicians. Their ‘mastery in corporate marketing extends to an unregulated and highly profitable industry of digital political campaigning’, but they additionally ‘mobilize populist public sentiment’ by ‘seeding revisionist history narratives\[,\] \[…\] silencing political opponents \[and\] \[…\] hijacking news media attention through artificially trending hashtags’ \( **2**\). Cabañes’ research thereby questioned some prevailing understandings of the term ‘trolling’, which tend to see it as individual rather than systemic activity. 

 Cabañes’ research contributed an ethnographically\-informed understanding of how, in the Philippines, the personal motivations, social backgrounds and everyday routines of digital workers impact their production of networked disinformation and fake news. The research was designed to focus on the systemic causes that lead to networked disinformation rather than on named or individual online ‘trolls’. His research also analysed how these workers use their fluency in vernacular ‘gutter languages’ to activate anger and resentment among sections of the Filipino public. The research exposed the vulnerabilities in Filipino creative industries that enabled politicians to recruit highly\-skilled individuals to become architects of ‘networked disinformation’. It also highlighted important gaps in Philippine campaign finance legislation and digital platform regulation, and proposed measures to address these.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

1.  Raising awareness of networked disinformation in the Philippines among lawmakers and citizens, stimulating public debate 

 Explicitly citing Cabañes’ research, in 2018 Philippine Congressman Manuel Zubiri filed three amendments to government bills across the Seventeenth and Eighteenth regular sessions of Congress. House bill 7863 petitioned for amendments to the Omnibus Election Code \(1985\), noting that such pre\-existing codes did not ‘reflect the changes in the electoral landscape’ and needed ‘to recognise the internet as a media platform where electioneering can be conducted’ \( **A**\). The Code does not currently account for any online political campaigning, and is not counted in either lawful or prohibited methods of propaganda. However, Zubiri argued that ‘as a form of media, the internet can be utilized – or worse, weaponized – for or against a particular candidate or political party’ \( **A**\). Congressman Zubiri argued that ‘\[g\]iven the recent study by media scholars Jason Cabañes and Jonathan Ong revealing the use of digital media as an elections tool, it may do well to update the provisions of the Fair Elections Act and the Omnibus Election Code to reflect the changes in the electoral landscape and to recognize the internet as a media platform where electioneering can be conducted’ \( **A**\). His proposed amendment to the Fair Election Act \( **B**\) cited Cabañes’ and Ong’s research, arguing that it ‘confirms the fact paid trolls are being used by political candidates’ and endorsing their proposal in the research that the Filipino government should craft ‘a Political Campaign Transparency Act to require politicians to disclose the political campaign materials for broad public discussion and regulation’ \( **B**\). 

 A version of this bill returned to Congress in the following session, advocating an amendment to the Fair Elections Act in the form of a Political Campaign Transparency Act. Congressman Zubiri proposed amendments to ensure political propaganda materials could be ‘properly identified by voters in order to help them make an informed choice’ and ‘help identify whether the candidate or benefactors of the candidate purchased online material which violated the Fair Election Act’ \( **C**\). Although not passed, the bills were debated in the Philippine Congress, and widely discussed in Filipino media and social media, highlighting how Cabañes’ and Ong’s research on networked disinformation stimulated political and policy debate and raised awareness among lawmakers and citizens about networked disinformation. 

 Media coverage continues to feature Cabañes and Ong’s research and recommendations. Cabañes was interviewed by Filipino news network ABS\-CBN News Channel, noting that social media disinformation continues to spread globally, and has become both a national and international crisis. *Rappler* \(a widely\-accessed Philippine online news website\) featured an interview with Cabanes’ project partner Jonathan Ong, who advocated for their shared idea of a political campaign transparency act \(see further ‘Rappler Talk: Disinformation in the 2019 Philippine midterm elections’, August 9 2019\). John Nery, columnist at the national daily newspaper, the *Philippine Daily Inquirer*, put together a pamphlet funded by the Friedrich Nauman Foundation for Freedom, entitled *Democratic Decay and Disinformation in the Digital Age*, citing Cabañes’ research in his call for change \( **D**\). Ricardo Saludo of *The Manila Times* used Cabañes’ research in an article asking Filipino voters not to ‘be impressed by masses of likes and positive or negative comments’ \(Ricardo Saludo \( **D**\)\). Cabañes and Ong’s research has featured in media coverage in the wake of such controversies. Both *Rappler* and ABS\-CBN have faced government sanctions for advocating online transparency and criticising the Duterte government: the CEO of *Rappler,* Maria Ressa has been convicted of ‘cyberlibel’ and ABS\-CBN are yet to have their licence renewed following clashes with the Philippine Government. In the wake of this, in December 2019, President Duterte made a public statement following the accusations of online intimidation, and Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo mentioned Cabañes and Ong’s research \( **E**\) alongside a refutation of claims made by ABS\-CBN concerning disinformation campaigns. 

1.  Benefiting organisations concerned with standards of democracy 

 Cabañes’ research has influenced the policies and practices of Philippine and international agencies working to dispel online disinformation. VeraFiles, a non\-profit organisation fact\-checking false and misleading claims, has proposed new ways of combatting digital disinformation as a result of Cabañes’ research \(Merinette Retona \( **D**\)\). Using his research, Cabañes has collaborated with media professionals to examine the role fact\-checking might play in dispelling digital and online misinformation. He consulted with Filipino firm Message, Movements, Media, Inc. \(MVMi Philippines\) and ABS\-CBN to assess the value and possible limitations of focusing solely on fact\-checking when combatting online disinformation. The Chief Operating Officer of MVMi testified that in working with Cabañes, MVMi ‘were able to advise \[their\] client about the new realities of public relations operations in the Philippines’ and also ‘on whether \[the clients\] are dealing with artificial or truly organic criticisms online’. They were also able to invest ‘in training opportunities for \[their\] community partners belonging to grassroots sectors,’ with the aim ‘to empower and encourage real people to re\-take social media away from proponents of inauthentic social narratives by becoming a counter\-force against a disinformation army that constantly seeks to silence citizens from expressing their opinions on social media’ \( **F**\). 

 Cabañes and Ong’s research continues to contribute to national and global awareness of authenticity online, The World Advertising Research Center \(WARC\), which provides evidence, expertise and guidance internationally to make marketers more effective and ethical, has reported on the impact of the research on the international standard for marketing \( **G**\). The Foundation for Media Alternatives \(FMA\) claimed Cabañes and Ong’s research had become ‘a landmark report’ on the topic of privacy and disinformation in the Philippines \( **H**\), as part of a discussion of how the Cambridge Analytica scandal had also impacted the Philippines more significantly than other populations. In the wake of their research, Ong and Cabañes were also commissioned by NATO to produce models of political trolling in the Philippines in order to counter disinformation \( **I**\). The resulting report uncovered new models of profit\-driven algorithm\-based production and proliferation of disinformation in both local and national political spheres of debate. This report further demonstrates the national and international impacts of Cabañes’ exposure of digital disinformation.

###  1. Summary of the impact: 

 Research carried out by the Centre for Legal Education \(CLE\) has had far\-reaching impact on changing the regulatory structures governing lawyers’ pre\- and post\- qualification education in the UK, Ireland and Australia. The research has led to a marked improvement in the quality of the provision of legal services by: 

1.  driving significant revisions to the policy of the Legal Services Board \(LSB\) and professional regulators for approximately 168,000 lawyers in England and Wales, and paralegals; and 

1.  influencing policy development and debate in professional legal education in Australia and research strategies in reviews of legal education in the Republic of Ireland. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Historically, legal professional education has employed “command and control” regulation emphasising e.g., curricula, time to be served in mandatory pre\-qualification work experience or hours of CPD. The introduction of the Legal Services Act 2007 required legal regulators in England and Wales to adopt “outcomes\-focused” regulation \(OFR\). This created a significant need for empirical research on whether the existing model of legal professional education was fit for purpose. 

 In 2010 the LSB commissioned Ching \(NTU\) and Maharg \(then Northumbria\), with Sherr \(IALS\) and Webb \(Warwick\), to undertake ‘the most substantial review of legal education and training since the publication of the Ormrod Report of 1971’ \( **R1**\). The Legal Education and Training Review \(LETR\) explored all stages of legal education and training, including the academic stage\(s\) of qualification, professional training and continuing professional development of the regulated professions. It identified both the scope for deregulation of existing training requirements, and whether there was a case for bringing aspects of the non\-regulated sector within a scheme of regulation. 

 Through a wide\-ranging international review of practice, impact analysis and various empirical methods \(interviews, focus groups and online surveys\), the LETR team assessed perceptions of the existing system in terms of skills, knowledge and attributes; assessed potential for sector\-wide outcomes; considered the unregulated sector; recommended means of response to emerging needs, including diversity. 

 Both Ching and Maharg \(2013\-2019\) made major contributions to the project, with Ching leading on Stage 3, which involved the collection and analysis of the qualitative data around the content and structures of legal education. The project included overseeing 56 interviews and 39 focus groups with a range of stakeholders including the regulated professions, paralegals, judges, trainees/pupils, academics and students. The research has been subject to peer review for quality assurance purposes. 

 Ching’s findings directly informed the research team’s overarching recommendation that legal professional education be recalibrated to ensure compliance with the statutory objectives, namely outcomes\-focused regulation, and fitness for the future. It was found that the existing qualification and CPD structures contained weaknesses in quality \(ethics, standardisation, inputs CPD models, lack of data supporting decision\-making\), accessibility \(internships, paralegal career progression, apprenticeships, information for aspiring lawyers\) and flexibility \(transfer between professions, narrow regulatory prescription of pathways\).  These findings enhance understanding of the effects of regulation at a sector\-wide level and, uniquely, of the relationships between the professions, including the often\-overlooked smaller professions. 

 Follow\-up research conducted two years \( **R2**\) and five years \( **R3**\) after the initial report found that significant change was beginning to take root in both policy and practice. However, further enhancement could be made by moving away from risk\-management compliance towards a form of ‘shared space’ that encourages individual responsibility, forges better links between researchers and the professions, and assists in the public understanding of legal education and training. 

 **R4** drew on the findings and methodology of **R1** to make bespoke recommendations concerning the qualifications of solicitors in the Republic of Ireland. 

 The quality of the underpinning research has been evidenced by rigorous externally peer reviewed outputs and has been widely used a point of reference for legal education beyond NTU.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Review led to changes in the nature of legal education and training in England & Wales and abroad in the following ways: 

1.  **Effecting a shift to outcomes/standards and outputs in CPD models** 

 As a direct result of recs 1\-7 and 17\-19 of the Review, the LSB instructed all regulators “to \[consider\] the evidence and recommendations contained within the Legal Education and Training Review and to complete a review of their regulatory arrangements for education and training” in March 2014. Regulators responded with plans of action. In a joint publication, authors from the SRA, CILEX Regulation, and the BSB stated: 

 *“It is worth noting how much of what we have done directly implements explicit      recommendations made by LETR”* \( **S2**\). 

 The LSB has confirmed that, since the publication of LETR, three \[England and Wales\] regulators have moved to an outcomes focused approach to Continuing Professional Development, and five such regulators have produced a competency statement setting out what an authorised person must be able to do on his or her first day of practice \( **S5**\). 

 In fact, all but one of the seven regulators \(775 notaries\) now use a competence statement \(c167,000 lawyers\).  The SRA proposes to assess all intending solicitors \(c4,000 per year\) against the competence statement from 2021. Outputs CPD was adopted for all 143,652 practising solicitors in November 2016 and all 16,435 practising barristers in January 2017 \( **S2, S5**\). 

1.  **Ensuring greater flexibility in mandatory pre\-qualification work experience** 

 Drawing on the Review’s recommendations to enhance diversity through embedding a greater variety of working environments, the SRA adopted the “equivalent means” qualification route and has, consistently with recs 15 and 22, increased the range of permitted environments. Similarly, the Bar now recognises “other forms of work\-based learning” as an alternative to pupillage \( **S2, S5**\). 

1.  **Validating voluntary regulation and quality assurance for the newly significant paralegal profession** 

 The Professional Paralegal Register, launched in December 2014, was created specifically in response to recs 22\-23 of the Review to address concerns around diversity and public interest objectives. It is a professional body with criteria for accreditation, a code of conduct and complaints mechanism.  It is supported by organisations including the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and the Legal Services Consumer Panel \( **S1**\). 

1.  **Influencing the modernisation of qualification frameworks in other jurisdictions** 

 The recommendations in the Legal Education and Training Review have significantly influenced policy developments in other jurisdictions. Indeed, **R2** and **R4** comment on the potential of its methodologies and findings to influence professional legal education in other jurisdictions. 

 For example, in 2014, the Australian Law Admissions Consultative Committee stated that the Legal Education and Training Review directly influenced their own investigations for the approximately 66,211 Australian practitioners: 

 *“it is both prudent and timely to take account of the Legal Education and Training Review presently underway in England and Wales …In June 2013, LETR released its Setting Standards report containing a wealth of data and analysis which are also very relevant to Australian circumstances.”* 

 In 2017, the Victorian Legal Admission Board \(Australia\) drew on the Legal Education and Training Review’s thinking and findings \(on standards and paralegals\) in formulating its own competence statement \( **S6, S7**\). 

 The Legal Education and Training Review also informed the research design of a confidential report to the Law Society of Ireland on improving solicitor education in a competitive legal services environment \( **R4**\). This research was commissioned in anticipation of a statutory review of the **Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which contains several similar provisions to the Legal Services Act 2007. R4** emphasised competences/outcomes and flexibility of study \(linked to diversity\).  It was adopted by the Council of the Law Society of Ireland, and was in turn submitted to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority \(LSRA\). 

 The findings were then incorporated into the statutory review \( **S8**\), whose recommendations \(concerning models of vocational course delivery, transfer for foreign lawyers and CPD\) are in alignment with **R4**. Following the statutory review, the LSRA has conducted further consultation in which the Law Society again relied on the report in its response. Further, the Law Society has, from 2019, offered a blended learning version of its vocational course in line with the research team’s recommendations \( **S8**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The 2017 BBC TV series Blue Planet II was scientifically underpinned by Open University \(OU\) research on ocean processes, large\-scale ocean circulation, marine carbon cycling and ocean acidification, geographic distributions of plankton, plastic degradability, and the courtship behaviour of marine animals. The OU staff’s work had a significant impact by: 

-  Contributing to the production, and steering the series narrative and scientific content of, a landmark documentary series watched by >250 million people. 

-  Increasing awareness of, and changing public and political attitudes and behaviours towards, ocean health in the UK. 

-  Stimulating political debate and influencing policy in the UK and Europe. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Large\-scale ocean circulation</ins> 

 The Atlantic’s Meridional Overturning Circulation \(MOC\) is a global conveyor belt of ocean currents that sustains life in the ocean through oxygen and nutrient\-rich dense water sinking at the poles and being replaced by warm water from the tropics in a continuous circulation. As global warming melts icecaps this freshens and lowers the density of polar source waters that would otherwise sink and ventilate the deep ocean. The stratification of some oceans is increasing as they warm, creating natural barriers to the vertical transfer of oxygen and nutrients throughout our oceans. 

 **Brandon’s** research has led to significant insights on the interaction between physical and biological processes in polar oceans that ventilate the ocean interior and drive the MOC **\[O1\]**. **Sexton** presented a new explanation for the compelling observation that tropical plankton disappeared from the Atlantic Ocean during each ice age and demonstrated that disappearances were driven by a better oxygenated tropical thermocline during ice ages. Water mass formation in relatively small polar areas thus regulates plankton population dynamics across the vast lower latitude oceans **\[O2\]**. 

 <ins>Marine carbon cycling and ocean acidification</ins> 

 The ‘marine snow’ of organic matter and shells of calcifying plankton that fall through the ocean when these organisms die acts as a ‘biological pump’ to transport carbon away from the upper ocean and atmosphere to the deep ocean **\[O1, O3\]** where it can remain for hundreds or thousands of years. This pump is a primary regulator of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels at these timescales. However, its complicated dynamics make it challenging to predict how climate change will affect this carbon pump. **Sexton** showed how carbon cycled within the ocean’s interior impacted acidification and carbonate saturation during extreme global warming events analogous to our current situation, providing a deeper understanding of the ocean’s likely response to ongoing global warming **\[O2\]**. **Anand** and **Sexton’s** ongoing palaeoceanographic proxy development programme yielded deeper understanding of the modern ocean’s biological pump **\[O3\]**. 

 <ins>Geographic distributions of free\-floating plankton and marine plastics</ins> 

 150 million tonnes of plastic reside in the world’s oceans today, carried by the global ocean circulation. Endemic micro\-plastics \(<5 mm\) are an increasing marine pollution component and interact detrimentally with species in a range of marine habitats. 

 Boardman has pioneered the use of remote sensing technology to detect micro\-plastics and investigate the breakdown of plastic products in oceanic and terrestrial environments and has defined biodegradability standards for lightweight carrier bags **\[O4\]**. Coupled to **Sexton’s** research that challenged the longstanding view that the ocean has tectonic and water mass ‘barriers’ to prevent the long\-distance dispersal of free\-floating plankton **\[O5\]**, we have new awareness of how and why microplastics are so widely dispersed. 

 <ins>Behavioural ecology of marine animals</ins> 

 **Dyson’s** research on sensory physiology, mating systems, mate choice and courtship behaviour of frogs and fiddler crabs **\[O6\]** is pertinent to the marine animal behaviours addressed in Blue Planet II and has revealed new insights into the roles of intra\- and inter\-sexual selection in shaping animal mating systems and auditory and visual communication systems.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Shaping the scientific content of the BBC TV series Blue Planet II** 

 The Open University \(OU\) was a co\-producer of the BBC series. In 2014 **Sexton**, **Brandon**, **Dyson**, and **Anand** were appointed Scientific Advisors. Broadcast from October 2017, it explored global marine life and the associated environment **\[C1\]**. As co\-producers our strategy involved advising on science and reaching publics directly through authoring associated material based on the series and our expertise. Approximately 37 million UK people and >500 million worldwide watched BPII **\[C1\]**. Our  [OU companion website](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/tv-radio-events/tv/blue-planet-ii) had >661,000 unique visitors; 25,180 made study enquiries **\[C2c\]**. We authored and produced an  [A0 poster](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/tv-radio-events/tv/download-your-free-oceans-poster) in English and Welsh with research\-level scientific information exploring ocean functioning and health; it was requested and sent to >587,000 UK addresses and downloaded >100,000 times **\[C2.1, C2.2, C2.3\]**. Our interactive game/learning resource \( [*Ocean Explorer*](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/oceanexplorer) *>*25,300 unique visitors\) was a bridge to formal curriculum \(>2,200 formal study enquiries\) **\[C2.4\]**, approximately 12,500 people read **Dyson** and **Sexton’s** BPII article in  [*The Conversation*](https://theconversation.com/blue-planet-academic-consultants-the-message-humanity-cannot-afford-to-ignore-86157) **\[C2.5\]**. 

 We supported the Executive Producers and production team and informed the narrative, ensuring scientific accuracy **\[C1\]** – this was critical given the strong environmental messages. For example: 

-  Episode 2, The Deep articulated principals in **\[O1 \- O5\]** on the biological pump and marine snow **\[O1 \- O3\]**, deep water formation and circulation **\[O1 \- O5\]**, controls on seawater density **\[O1, O2\]**, ventilation of the deep ocean and oxygen supply to the ocean interior **\[O2, O3\]**. 

-  Episode 3, Coral Reefs explored the impact of coral bleaching **\[O2, O3\]**. 

-  Episode 4, Big Blue drew on deep\-ocean ventilation and large\-scale ocean circulation research **\[O2, O3, O5\]** including a compelling animation of the overturning circulation system. 

-  Episodes 4, & 7, Our Blue Planet featured insights from **\[O5\]** on the distribution of free\-floating plankton populations and the vertical overturning circulation **\[O2, O3\]** to contextualise oceanic plastics distribution; **\[O4\]** explained plastics dispersal. 

-  Episode 7 Contrasted the melting of floating ice shelves versus grounded ice on sea level rise **\[O1\]** and featured carbon chemistry insights on ocean acidification **\[O2, O3\]**. 

 **Dyson’s** understanding of animal behaviour, communication, and physiology **\[O6\]** ensured all episodes reflected sound evolutionary knowledge. 

 **Increasing awareness of, and changing public attitudes and behaviours towards ocean health** 

 In 2018 the BBC and Open University co\-produced *Blue Planet Live* – a three\-week event – to highlight marine health. Boardman and **Dyson** were Scientific Advisors and, with **Sexton** and **Brandon**, produced a supporting booklet including information on plastics recycling sent to approximately 99,100 UK addresses on request **\[C3.1\]**; between March 2018 and October 2019, **Brandon** and **Sexton** held five ‘oceans’ talks to an audience of approximately 1371 across the UK and Ireland to share their own and OU colleagues’ research **\[O1\-O6, C3.2\]**. 

 Our survey sent to 467,502 poster recipients \(89,188 responses – 19.1%\) shows, after engaging with our poster: 94% said they better understood the threats facing our oceans, 91% felt motivated to change their behaviour to reduce their environmental impact \(e.g., plastics use\) and 48% have since enquired about climate change activism **\[C6\]**. Our survey of 139 OU talk attendees \(42 responses – 30.2%\) shows, because of attending: 93% reported increased awareness of ocean health, 91% changed their behaviour **\[C6\]**. 

 The public impact of BPII and associated public engagement activities catapulted ocean issues into public consciousness and this has changed people’s attitudes and behaviour. An independent survey \(n=2000\) revealed similar findings to our own \(n=89,188\+139\) – 88% of viewers having changed their behaviour regarding plastics as a result **\[C5.1\]**. Following broadcast, global conservation charities experienced major jumps in website traffic **\[C5b\]**. Independent research demonstrated an increase in plastic pollution\-related terms being used by the media and politicians **\[C4,** pp.7\-13 **\]**. A letter from the UK Government Minister for Science, Research and lnnovation confirmed the importance and impact of our work and approach on the global conversation **\[C7\]**. 

 **Public consciousness stimulated political debate and influenced UK and European policy** 

 Then Prime Minister Theresa May highlighted BPII in a speech on the environment **\[C8.1\]** and the series has been mentioned 140 times in parliamentary debates since broadcast 29/10/2017 **\[C8.2\]**: A November 2017 parliamentary debate on Antarctic ocean conservation policy described the series as “ *an exemplar of the delicate and vulnerable nature of biodiversity in the deep oceans”* **\[C8.3\]**. 

 Blue Planet II influenced the UK Government to legislate to ban microbeads \(2018\), single\-use plastics including straws \(2020\) **\[C9\]**, and to increase charges for single\-use plastic bags in England from 5 to 10 pence \(2018\) **\[C9\]**. The European Commission cited BPII in its 2018 decision to ban single\-use plastics **\[C10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 King’s research has helped deliver the wide\-ranging therapeutic potential of metal\-chelating hydroxypyridinones \(HOPOs\). 

 Building on our development of *Deferiprone* as a standard treatment for β\-thalassemia, research on iron\-chelating HOPOs has created next generation HOPO therapeutics with improved efficiency and reduced toxicity, now in commercialization by Zede Pharma\-Tech Ltd. Beyond β\-thalassemia, our work has also established HOPOs as a potential therapy for free radical\-based neurotoxicity, and HOPO compounds for Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases have entered Phase 2 trials, with reported improved patient outcomes. 

 We have similarly developed and patented HOPO <sup>68</sup>Ga chelators as new tools for radiopharmaceutical delivery. Working with Theragnostics Ltd, a kit for simple on\-site radiotracer production for prostate cancer PET imaging was established. This kit has improved the accessibility of prostate cancer screening, leading to reduced screening delays \(from several months to weeks\), improved treatment decisions in over 1,500 patients to date, and cost savings of GBP600 to GBP1,500 per patient **.** Phase 3 trials are currently underway, and in 2019 GE Healthcare and Theragnostics entered a commercial partnership for a worldwide rollout of *Galliprost.*

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The ‘hard’ metal binding properties, simple derivatization, and biocompatibility of HOPO chelators make them attractive as potential therapeutics \- both in the direct treatment of metal ion dysfunction, and as metallodrug components. In a coordinated strategy, chemists in the Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Department for Imaging Chemistry & Biology have worked to develop HOPOs as future therapeutics in a number of important disease areas: 

 **King’s researchers discovered a new class of HOPOs that avoids agranulocytosis \- the most significant side effect in their current use to treat β\-thalassemia.** Earlier research by Prof Robert Hider on iron\-chelating HOPOs led to the creation of *Deferiprone*, now a standard treatment for β\-thalassemia patients worldwide. As part of our campaign to develop improved HOPOs, a range of novel R<sub>2</sub> substituted, multidentate, and dendritic chelators were developed \(e.g. \[ **1**, **2**\]\). Building on this framework, synthesis with collaborators at Zhejiang University produced a library of next\-generation HOPO analogues for screening. Lead compounds show metal selectivity comparable to *Deferiprone*, but with significantly improved iron scavenging ability. A patent was granted in 2014 \(EP2692724A1\), with underpinning work published in 2020 \[ **3**\]. 

 **King’s researchers demonstrated that HOPO iron\-chelators can also be used to address free radical\-based neurotoxicity**. In response to the discovery that Parkinson’s disease is associated with the concentration of iron in the brain, and that iron also promotes the toxicity of amyloid β\-peptide, we sought to apply HOPOs to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Our research has established a protective effect from HOPOs on neurons under a range of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease relevant insults \[ **4**\]. 

 **We transformed iron\-capturing HOPOs into gallium\-capturing molecules.** Based on the chemical similarities between iron and gallium, collaboration between Profs Hider \(Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences\) and Blower \(Department for Imaging Chemistry & Biology, and Head of Department of Chemistry 2012 – 2013\) led to the development of new bifunctional tris\-hydroxypyridinone chelators, able to simply and selectivity capture <sup>68</sup>Ga at room temperature, neutral pH, and micromolar concentrations of ligand \(e.g. \[ **5**\]\). We modified HOPO gallium chelators with targeting epitopes including proteins and small peptides to create a new class of radiotracer agents for cancer screening. We demonstrated that the resulting compounds fulfilled the therapeutic requirements for simple production, rapid radiolabelling, and high contrast imaging in animal models \(e.g., \[ **6**\]\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Our work to improve HOPO iron\-chelators has led to a next generation of therapy for β\-thalassemia** **resulting in improved patient outcomes** **and the founding of the company Zede Pharma Tech.** β\-thalassemia major is the world’s most common genetic blood disorder, affecting 330,000 infants per year globally. Children only survive with transfusion of normal red blood cells **;** but frequent transfusions lead to a toxic build\-up of iron and without treatment to remove excess iron they die by age \~25. 

 The iron\-chelating HOPO *Deferiprone* is a standard treatment for β\-thalassemia; developed as a result of our earlier work in this area. Over 50,000 people are now treated with *Deferiprone* each year, providing each with a lifespan extension of 45 years on average. In 2015 *Deferiprone* was approved by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, marking the effective conclusion of a sequence of regulatory approvals in 65 countries, including the EU, USA, and China. 

 In August 2013, our collaboration with researchers at Zhejiang University led to *CN128*, a compound with improved chelation efficiency and reduced side effects for β\-thalassemia \[ **3**\]. Based on this discovery Zede Pharma Tech was established. Prof Hider is a board member of Zede Pharma Tech. In 2020, the company had a registered capital of RMB12,110,000 \(GBP1,350,000 02/2021\) \[ **A**\]. Zede Pharma Tech has successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials on *CN128* \(NCT03673085, NCT03935633\), and a GBP5,000,000 Phase 2 clinical trial \(NCT04614779\) is currently underway at Guangxi University Hospital. To date, these preclinical results showed that the commercialised compounds derived from our research are 4 times more efficient than *Deferiprone* at removing toxic iron, with no indications, to date, of agranulocytosis in either primates or humans. 

 **HOPO iron\-chelators have entered Phase 2 trials for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with improved patient outcomes.** Beyond β\-thalassemia, our research \[ **4**\] demonstrated that HOPOs can address free radical\-based neurotoxicity. Phase 1 \(NCT00943748\) and 2 \(NCT01539837, NCT02728843\) clinical trials of *Deferiprone* in Parkinson’s Disease patients show reduced severity of symptoms and slower disease progression.  In February 2016, a larger trial \(NCT02655315\) began, recruiting 372 Parkinson’s patients at 25 sites across eight European countries; the trial is expected to finish in spring 2021. A Phase 2 trial to investigating the potential for *Deferiprone* to treat Alzheimer’s disease is underway \(NCT03234686\). 

 **Commercialisation of HOPO <sup>68</sup>Ga chelators has provided improved accessibility of prostate cancer screening, leading to reduced screening delays \(from months to weeks\) and improved treatment decisions in over 1500 patients.** Prostate cancer kills over 10,000 men annually in the UK. Positron Emission Tomography \(PET\) imaging, central to managing prostate cancer, relies on radiotracers to identify cancer cells. However, traditional methods of radiotracer synthesis are complex, needing an on\-site cyclotron and time\-consuming costly preparation. This significantly limits the availability of PET imaging. 

 We developed tris\-hydroxypyridinone \(THP\), a patented \(WO2012063028A1, WO2017076879A1\) chelator engineered for fast and efficient <sup>68</sup>Ga radiolabelling. We also formulated a simple single\-vial sterile kit for producing the tracer quickly under clinical, “good manufacturing practice” \(GMP\) conditions \[ **B**\]. *Galliprost* preparation takes just 15 minutes \(compared to several hours for conventional tracers\) \[ **C**\] and provides a ‘heatmap’ image of Prostate\-Specific Membrane Antigen in PET/CT scans. This formulation allows the tracer to be produced on site, in a manner suitable for frontline healthcare staff, without complex procedures or infrastructure. 

 The impact of this work is evidence by the screening service established in partnership with Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals. Dr Gibson, Head of Radiopharmacy emphasised *“The development of Galliprost kit formulation has had a massive impact on the Clinical service…*.” Notably, this service was set up much more quickly \(from several months to just 4 weeks for initial validation; and from typically 6 hours to 15 minutes for daily production\) compared to what could be done previously. To date, this service has benefited over 1,000 patients at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals alone and provides significant cost savings of GBP600 to GBP1,500 per patient \[ **C**\]. More widely, *Galliprost* is now used in routinely in 12 hospitals across Europe \[ **C, D, E**\], and by July 2020 an estimated total of 1,500\+ patients had benefited from the use of *Galliprost* \[ **C, D, E, F**\]. A phase 2 clinical study demonstrated that one third of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients \- and over 50% of patients with biochemically recurrent disease \- had their treatment plans modified as a result of a *Galliprost* scan. The change in patient management increased to 75% in a post\-radical radiotherapy setting \[ **G**\]. 

 **Galliprost** has created direct economic benefit.** We licensed our intellectual property to Theragnostics Ltd \(formally Imaging Equipment Research Ltd\), who commercialised the kit formulation. Prof Blower is a Scientific Advisory Board Member of Theragnostics. Theragnostics has accrued GBP13,000,000 in investment capital, \~90% directed towards *Galliprost* development. Phase 2 trials \(NCT03617588\) were completed in 2020, with Phase 3 prostate cancer trials now underway, with FDA/MHRA approval targeted for 2021. Theragnostics has recently launched a USD45,000,000 Series A financing round to take *Galliprost* to market \[ **I**\]. 

 Since 2016, Theragnostics has appointed 6 staff in the UK and 4 in USA as a result of *Galliprost*. The investment and progress through clinical trials has led to milestone payments and accrued royalties \[ **H**\], and to new research scientist and PhD student appointments at King’s funded by Theragnostics; totalling GBP500,000, with a future additional commitment of GBP530,000 \[ **G**\]. 

 **Further economic impact has also occurred via sub\-licensing**. Theragnostics commissioned CheMatech \(France, 2016\) to synthesise THP derivatives for sales to researchers for development of their own radiopharmaceuticals, and to supply the THP\-PSMA conjugate for Galliprost kit production \[ **I**\]. 

 **Our work has resulted in the worldwide distribution of Galliprost**.** In 2019, Theragnostics entered a commercial partnership with GE Healthcare to provide global distribution, preparation, and further development of *Galliprost* \[ **J**\]. The US market estimate for this treatment is USD500,000,000.

","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research in this ICS builds on 20 years of world\-class abrasives research that has helped transform global industrial grinding practice. By addressing current challenges, the research broadens abrasive machining applications. The key research insights and findings include: 

 \[a\] Research in high efficiency deep grinding \(HEDG\), initially led by Prof. Brian Rowe \[ **RO1, RG1**\], has resulted in a tenfold increase in material removal rate \(up to 2000 mm<sup>3</sup>/mm/s\) and a fivefold reduction in specific energy \(down to 6\~7 J/mm<sup>3</sup>\). The models developed for grinding kinematics, mechanics and thermal heat transfer has provided the insights for optimising grinding performance \[ **RO2,3**\]. 

 \[b\] Fundamental research of abrasive machining, focused on the workpiece\-to\-tool interactions, has led to pioneering work in the material removal mechanics, high efficiency deep grinding processes, special fluid delivery systems, and minimum quantity lubrication \(MQL\) for grinding processes \[ **RO1,2,4, RG2,3,4**\]. The outcomes of these research studies have been adopted in abrasive tools, machine tools, automotive and aerospace industry sectors \[ **RG5\-9**\]. A digital\-based process optimisation tool \(POSY\) was developed \[ **RG5,6**\] for production decision support and process cost estimation \[ **RO5**\]. 

 \[c\] Based on the research foundations established in \[b\] above, a new glass abrasive tool has been developed as the first innovation in this field for more than 50 years, for the mass finishing \(MF\) industry, with improved process insight and understanding \[ **RO5, RG4\-6**\]. This evolution of direction resulted in the funded collaborative research with industry \[ **RG5,6**\] in the emerging area of metal additive manufacturing, a technology strongly reliant on the capability of surface finishing for its wider industry uptake, as well as in the fast\-growing biomedical engineering sector. The research direction has been increasingly focused on the wider disciplines of digital engineering, robotics, and numerical modelling. 

 \[d\] Research into intelligent machine control systems has led to new adaptive controlled grinding process systems \[ **RO3, RG1**\]. This resulted in the development of a servo\-assisted manual machine tool control system \(SAMM\) that was taken forward to production by an international machine tool manufacturer \[ **RO2, RG8**\]. Artificial Intelligence\-based methodologies coupled with the adaptive control strategies led to the development of the first fully\-integrated intelligent grinding machine control \[ **RO6**\] that is now a commonplace system integration. This system reduces operator management and intervention. With an optimised grinding cycle based on on\-line monitoring, the grinding cycle time was reduced by up to 50%. This breakthrough attracted an international collaboration with the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology \(USST\) and Ningbo Great Group Co. Ltd. \[ **RO3**\]. 

 The research was carried out in collaboration with a wide range of manufacture\-industry partners and supported through external funding of over £3m from sources including the EPSRC, Innovate UK, EU, and industry from 2000 to 2020 \[ **RGs 1\-9**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Sustainable development for a smart future requires novel manufacturing technologies capable of producing continually evolving precision components, for improved product performance with lower energy consumption and higher productivity. Underpinning research that has been conducted since 2000 has brought significant impacts over the assessment period. 

 **A. High Efficiency Deep Grinding \(HEDG\)** 

 The HEDG offers a fivefold reduction in energy consumption and material removal rates up to 10 times higher than prevailing common practice. The maximum material removal rate achieved by the most advanced commercial grinding machine is 200 mm<sup>3</sup>/mm/s compared to 1000\-2000 mm<sup>3</sup>/mm/s achieved by HEDG. It cuts down the grinding specific energy from over 120 J/mm<sup>3</sup> \(400 J/m<sup>3</sup> for nickel alloy\) to an average of just 7\-10J/mm<sup>3</sup> \[ **RO1, RG1,2**\]. 

 Partner Landis\-Lund, a branch of an industrial engineering group, Fives, has used the HEDG in its twin crankshaft grinders worldwide since 2013 \[ **SC1**\]. The results show the grinding cycle time was reduced by 50% thus doubling the production. Specific grinding energy has reduced from 43 J/mm<sup>3</sup> to 7 J/mm<sup>3</sup> with an associated specific grinding material removal rate of 2000 mm<sup>3</sup>/mm/s. With annual production of around 120 machines and a grinding capacity of some 1,000,000 parts per year, the impact on the bottom line has been significant. “… A mechanism for predicting an acceptable rough grinding regime has been built into the decision process for production engineering in our cylindrical component manufacturing. Landis\-Lund have been able to add a reliable tool backed by solid research evidence that allows competitive tendering for work which would otherwise have been seen as beyond the capacity of present machine configuration” \[ **SC1**\]. 

 Saint\-Gobain Abrasives Ltd has also benefited from the HEDG. “In this particular case the research shows us a way to extend the area of application for grinding wheels into areas formally held by milling. This has helped Saint\-Gobain move outside traditional areas of grinding with HEDG” \[ **SC2**\]. 

 International engagement led to the development of novel Lithia\-glass\-ceramic bonded wheels that have very high wear resistance and 2\-3 times longer life than their counterparts. “…The joint work with LJMU has helped us position the developed bond on the market and secure over $0.5m financial support from the Chinese government and other private equities to set up our own new factory of grinding wheel production in the High and New Technology Development Zone, in Jinan of Shandong Province, as ‘Jinan Kechuang Super Hard Material Products Co. Ltd’...” \(Director X.F. Zhang\) \[ **SC3**\]. 

 **B. Vibration Assisted High Efficiency Deep Grinding \(Vibro\-HEDG\)** 

 Innovation in low frequency vibration assisted HEDG, “Vibro\-HEDG”, attracted six industrial collaborators from the grinding process supply chain \- Jones & Shipman \(machine tool manufacturer\), Tyrolit \(grinding wheel manufacturer\), Fuchs \(cutting fluid manufacturer\), Bosch Rexroth \(drives and controls manufacturer\), Joloda International Ltd \(heavy lifting gear manufacturer\), and Winbro Group Technologies \(aerospace parts manufacturer\) \[ **RG8**\]. As a result of the collaboration, a theory was developed \[ **RO4**\] and an oscillatory motion was experimentally added to the process. Subsequently, Jones and Shipman designed and manufactured the world’s first commercial prototype of this machine in 2014. This concept has also been adopted by Blohm in Germany to develop a highly efficient \(‘Prokos’\) grinding technology, which is a direct industrial application of the Unit’s work in low frequency oscillation/vibration of the workpiece. 

 Technical Services Coordinator of Jones & Shipman stated “…As a grinding machine manufacturer with an international market presence … experience with … HEDG shows that there is a large market available, especially in the aerospace industry. Currently available machine tools have … reached their limit of machining speeds. A step change in speed and efficiency… Vibro\-HEDG gives increased machining rates and at the same time reduces energy requirements by 30%. With the introduction of this new product, our market share has been growing in Europe and more significantly in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil….” \[ **SC4**\]. 

 **C. The Mass Finishing \(MF\) Abrasive Product** 

 Fundamental research of MF with glass abrasives has led to a new abrasive tool based wholly on thermally treated recycled glass that was conceived and developed for the mass finishing industry \[ **RG4\-6**\]. The tool has a proven capability and strong environmental credentials. The research initiated collaboration between LJMU and the UK HVM Catapult, which was the catalyst for the formation of regional Manufacturing Technology Centre \(MTC\) located at LJMU, the MTC@LJMU, rebranded \(2019\) as MTC@Liverpool to better reflect its wider regional remit. 

 The MF research has directly led to Potters\-Vibraglaz building a new £2.5m factory in the UK \(Barnsley\) for high volume production of the abrasive product \[ **RO5**\] within a sector valued circa £1B/annum, immediately creating 8 new jobs. Sales revenue reached £1.2m in the first two years of production \(2017 \-2019\) \[ **SC5**\]. The Technical Director \(Potters\-Ballotini/Vibraglaz\), Mr S. Vaughan, stated: “…The cooperation over the past decade with Professor Morgan and his team has been invaluable in supporting and contributing to the development of this product. This has widened our product range in both the general purpose and niche markets for finishing products, and has added opportunity to extend our customer base and approach to sales and marketing. …” \[ **SC5**\]. 

 The product uses only recycled/recyclable glass and offers a method of finishing that is more environmentally beneficial than any other process technology. It also offers a cost saving of 40% per tonne of media due to legislative compliance, waste management, and tool economies \[ **SC6**\]. The Principal Technologist of GTS, Mr. M. Marshall states: “... this has added to our baseline understanding ...and also aided our understanding of how thermal processing and physical forming in the laboratory needs to be developed when the technique comes to scale up and exploitation…the team at LJMU brought their experience and abilities to bear to make progress and deliver results” \[ **SC6**\]. 

 **D. Process Optimisation Methodology** 

 The POSY system \[ **RO5**\] offers cost savings \(2019\) associated with pre\-production evaluation of new components in the order £2000<Costs<£5000 per part, with new parts commonly arriving at weekly intervals \[ **SC7**\]. Technical Director of Fintek states: “…The finishing results were outstanding and demonstrated the benefit of this POSY approach. I commend Professor Morgan and his research team on the quality and usefulness of this research work. Working with LJMU has increased our industry standing and we are now regarded as Surface Finishing Specialists throughout many fields \- particularly additive manufacturing” \[ **SC7**\]. 

 The system delivers optimised processes for many other applications including pharmaceutical, food processing, agriculture and automotive. This system’s flexibility has directly led to its adoption by the MTC to support a number of high value projects, for example, *the* £14.3m DRAMA project over 3 years \[ **SC7**\]. “…The Process Optimisation system ……is unique and transformative as it now allows a process, which is dependent on the control of numerous parameters each having variable effect, to be designed to perform at an optimal set of conditions without extensive and expensive prior testing. A real benefit of the approach is the genericity and ease of application” \[ **SC7**\]. 

 The world\-leading research on 3\-D discrete element modelling \(DEM\) for simulation of granular fluidised flows within MF processes \[ **RG4, RO5**\] provided a new capability for realistic low cost exploration of the processes responsible for surface evolution within MF processes. This simulator improves the understanding of process physics and impacts machine tool design through optimised process economics and performance. Through collaboration with LJMU, OTEC GmbH, Germany, the European leader in advanced mass finishing technologies, has exploited this advance in the design of their most advanced machines to assist with wear avoidance. “The effect of the increased knowledge has led to selling one additional finishing machine per year of approx. 80.000\-100.000 €” for OTEC” \[ **SC8**\]. 

 The work on grinding cycle optimisation strategies \[ **RO3**\] has been used by Ningbo Great Group Co. Ltd. in China, securing more than 30% improvement of productivity in the production line of bearings. From 2016 to 2020, the implementation of these strategies directly resulted in financial benefit averaging ¥7m \(£790k\) per year, giving the company a competitive edge in the roller bearing market, which was valued at $21.3 billion in 2018. “The application of your cycle optimisation strategies and grinding process parameter optimisation has positively impacted on our company performance in terms of the production time saving, the improvement of bearing grinding efficiency, and greatly improved our company's product quality. Sustained application of your technology secured an increasing improvement by more than 30% in the production efficiency of relevant products amounting to a total of ¥21m \(£2.37m\) gain from March 2016 to the end of 2019” \[ **SC9**\]. 

 **E. Metal Additive Manufacturing \(AM\) Research** 

 The research in this area categorically demonstrated that MF processes can be designed to deliver high\-quality surface finishes on AM parts possessing a complex geometry \[ **RO5**\]. The research \[ **RG4**\] demonstrated the benefit of two\-stage finishing systems, which has important implications for the design of the finishing cell and has resulted in the development of a new finishing capability within the MTC \[ **SC7**\]. 

 A further key outcome from the partnership with Croft was the enhancement to the POSY \(a single objective system\) that elevated it to a multi\-response optimisation system \[ **RO5**\]. The advanced POSY system was successfully applied to their AM production of bespoke and advanced filter and filtration assembly components. The Technical Director of Croft AM, Dr L. Geekie states: “This challenging project has delivered an in\-process control for the production of AM components to target surface finish requirements and has proven the benefit of high energy mass finishing processes for high specification external finishing…” \[ **SC10**\].

 Researchers at Exeter definitively demonstrated that mindfulness\-based cognitive therapy \(MBCT\) is an effective and affordable non\-pharmaceutical alternative for treating clinical depression and preventing depressive relapse across the NHS. This work has **changed UK and worldwide mental health policies and clinical guidelines for depression/mood disorders**; **improved access to MBCT in routine clinical service**; **changed clinical practice** by developing and running a national professional training curriculum for MBCT and training mental health practitioners in the NHS and beyond; **enhanced experience and outcomes for patients**; and **delivered cost savings for the NHS and wider society**.  As a result, over 10,000 patients across 40% of the NHS’s depression and anxiety treatment services have been able to receive MBCT, while saving the NHS an estimated £20 million per year. 100% have either recovered or showed significant clinical improvement; access to the treatment is set to double by 2024.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Mindfulness\-based cognitive therapy \(MBCT\), a group\-based psychosocial intervention that combines cognitive behavioural therapy with mindfulness \- the awareness of being mentally, physically and emotionally in the moment \- has emerged as a promising treatment for clinical depression. MBCT teaches people skills to become more aware of the bodily sensations, thoughts and feelings associated with depression in order to stay well in the long term. These skills also cultivate self\-compassion and remain effective long after the sessions have ended, thus preventing relapse. A Phase 2 trial published in 2008 pointed to the usefulness of MBCT **\[3.1\]** but robust scientific evidence was lacking as to whether the treatment could be scaled up as an effective and affordable alternative to antidepressant medication across the NHS. University of Exeter researchers have filled this knowledge gap, definitively demonstrating for the first time that MBCT is as effective as medication in reducing relapse in those suffering from depression. The research has informed and supported the implementation of this valuable new treatment in healthcare settings in the UK and beyond. 

 **Establishing the effectiveness of MBCT** 

 For seven years, researchers at Exeter ran two MRC\- and NIHR\-funded randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness and cost\-effectiveness of MBCT. The definitive trial, PREVENT, published in 2015, **\[3.2\]** demonstrated that the psychosocial group intervention was an equally effective, affordable alternative to maintenance antidepressants, with a one\-off cost of £112 per patient. MBCT improved physical and psychological quality of life and the use of antidepressants in the MBCT group was significantly reduced with 75% completely discontinuing their antidepressants. **\[3.1, 3.2\]** Patients found MBCT skills helpful as a longer\-term solution for discontinuing their medication. **\[3.6\]** With 12% lower relapse rates than maintenance antidepressant medication, MBCT was particularly beneficial for individuals with recurrent depression who report high severity of childhood abuse. **\[3.2\]** A systematic review of the effects of MBCT on those with major depressive disorder concluded that there were positive clinical impacts on mindfulness, rumination, worry, self\-compassion, attention, memory, self\-discrepancy and emotional reactivity. **\[3.3\]** 

 **Implementing MBCT in the NHS** 

 After several years of MBCT being recommended by the NICE \(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\) guidance for treating depression, Exeter researchers investigated how MBCT could be effectively implemented in the NHS across the UK. Exeter led a collaborative project with the Universities of Bangor and Oxford \(2014\-2017\) revealing improved patient outcomes, quality of life, and wellbeing in routine clinical settings across the UK. **\[3.4\]** The NIHR\-funded implementation study revealed that recovery was maintained in 96% of remitted depressed individuals and 53% of those currently depressed made a full recovery. **\[3.5\]** In a cross\-national sample of 1,554 patients, 96% of those currently remitted starting treatment sustained their recovery \(i.e. remained in the non\-depressed range\) across the treatment period, and showed significant reduction in residual symptoms, consistent with a reduced risk of depressive relapse. Almost half \(45%\) of those clinically depressed at treatment start, recovered or showed significant reduction in depression severity from pre\- to post\-treatment. **\[3.5\]**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 More than 300 million people worldwide and 3 in 100 in England experience clinical depression, with chronic and recurring forms of the illness causing not only individual suffering but detrimental economic and social impacts. In the UK, as elsewhere, the health system has for decades relied on prescribing medication for treating depression. Although effective in symptom management and for preventing relapses, antidepressants often have to be taken over years, representing a substantial and growing financial burden for the NHS \(e.g.70.9 million prescriptions were written for antidepressants in 2018 in UK compared to only 36 million prescriptions in 2008\). At the same time, medications can be accompanied by undesirable side\-effects, such as addiction and withdrawal symptoms, and many patients prefer psychological therapies instead. 

 Over the past twenty years, interest has been growing in the potential for mindfulness\-based cognitive therapy \(MBCT\) as a non\-pharmaceutical alternative for the treatment of depression and depressive relapse prevention. However, before the Exeter research, it was unknown whether MBCT could be effective as a stand\-alone treatment in the NHS and how it could be rolled out to treat large numbers of patients. The Exeter research filled this knowledge gap, leading to **five distinct and beneficial impacts**: changes in policy and clinical guidelines; improved clinical training and practice; greater access to MBCT; enhanced patient experience and outcomes; and cost savings for the NHS and wider society. Each impact is detailed below. 

 **Changes in UK and worldwide mental health policies and clinical guidelines for depression/mood disorders** 

 Exeter’s research **\[3.2\]** was referenced by the Mindfulness All\-Party Parliamentary Group who recommended group\-based MBCT for depressive relapse in their 2015 report *Mindful Nation UK,* **\[5.1\]** and it will also be recommended in the updated version of *Depression in adults: treatment and management*, **\[5.2\]** guidelines which will be published in 2022 by NICE. The lead of the NICE Depression Guideline Development Group confirms that “ *Exeter’s work was vital in understanding how MBCT could be successfully implemented in psychological services, providing an effective alternative to antidepressant medication to those suffering from recurrent depression. This has directly led to the inclusion of MBCT in the NICE Guidelines on Depression as a recommended intervention for relapse prevention*.” **\[5.3\]** 

 **Significance**:* Prior to the Exeter research, policy and clinical guidelines in the UK for depression treatment and relapse prevention did not prioritise MBCT. Exeter’s work has led to policy makers and clinicians in the UK and overseas promoting MBCT for the first time. 

 **Reach**:* Up to 15% \(87,000\) of the patients suffering from depression and being at risk for relapse across the UK **\[5.1,** see page 5 for example **\]** will benefit from the new policies and guidelines influenced by Exeter’s work. The policy impacts extend overseas too: MBCT for depression treatment and relapse prevention is now recommended by the American Psychological Association, one of the largest professional organisations worldwide, with Exeter research **\[3.3\]** cited in its treatment guidelines **\[5.4\].** Similarly, MBCT is now recommended in the national clinical guidelines for relapse prevention in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, **\[5.4\]** and again Exeter’s research is cited **\[3.1\], \[3.2\]** and **\[3.3\]**. 

 **Improved access to MBCT in routine clinical services** 

 As well as influencing policy, since 2014, Exeter has worked closely with IAPT \(Improving Access to Psychological Therapies\), the key national treatment provider for depression and anxiety disorders in England, to improve access to MBCT for patients with depression. 

 **Reach**:* To date, MBCT has been implemented in about 40% of IAPT services, encompassing 63 NHS Trusts, across England and, between 2015 and 2020 West IAPT staff were trained in MBCT at Exeter, which informed the development of a national programme in 2016/17 \(funded by NHS England\) when Exeter partnered with four other mindfulness centres across the UK to deliver MBCT IAPT training: London and South East Sussex Mindfulness Centre, North Oxford Mindfulness Centre, Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice \(Bangor University\),  Midlands and East Nottingham Centre for Mindfulness \(Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust\) and the MBCT Training Programme in Tees Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation Trust. As of autumn 2020, 154 IAPT staff have been trained nationally, of those 100 in Exeter alone, each with a capacity to deliver MBCT to approximately 50 or more patients per year **.** It is anticipated that a further 80 MBCT therapists will be trained. **\[5.5\]** 

 **Significance**:* Exeter researchers are directly responsible for the increased access to MBCT in the southwest and nationally. The Programme Director of IAPT training until August 2020, confirms that: *“…as a result of the PREVENT research conducted at the University of Exeter on MBCT, we have been able to train and partner with other organisations to train IAPT therapists in MBCT across both the South West and the whole of England”* **\[5.5\]**, has benefitted a total of 10,453 patients, **\[5.10\]** with up to an additional 44000 projected to be receiving MBCT by 2024. From 2024, the level of access is likely to ramp up still further because IAPT aims to double its current reach to 1.9 million patients by 2023/24. Conservatively, that would equate to between 5,000 and 10,000 patients who could receive MBCT every year across the country \[prediction based on NHS Mental Health Implementation Plan 2019/20 – 2023/24, published July 2019, page 23\]. 

 **Improved clinical practice by uniform national professional training curriculum for MBCT and training of mental health practitioners in the NHS** 

 MBCT is a complex approach that needs to be delivered well to gain full benefit. Through online and in\-person training, Exeter researchers have directly influenced the improvement of the standard of professional training for clinicians practising, or seeking to practise, mindfulness\-based interventions. In 2016 Exeter researchers influenced and contributed to the development of a new national MBCT professional training curriculum for IAPT staff. **\[5.6\]** In tandem with Bangor University, Exeter researchers developed online training resources and assessment materials **\[3.4\]** which are freely available to MBCT practitioners for continuing professional development \(http://www.implementing\-mindfulness.co.uk\). The CBT Lead for West Dorset branch of the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies, completed the Exeter University IAPT mindfulness teaching pathway in 2014. They have since treated over 300 patients who are showing improvement in line with national data and experiencing continued positive mental health. *“I have access to Exeter’s online training resources and assessment materials so I may continue to update my practice and refer back to at any time, strengthening my skills and abilities to help this population.”* **\[5.7\]** Exeter researchers \(in collaboration with Bangor and Oxford\) have also developed and validated a new tool, MBI: TAC \(Mindfulness\-Based Interventions: Teaching Assessment Criteria\), for assessing the teaching competence and programme adherence of MBCT practitioners during professional training. The tool has improved training quality standards for mindfulness practitioners, ultimately enhancing patient care. **\[5.8\]** 

 **Significance**:* Exeter’s work has influenced the Professional training standards of MBCT across the UK and beyond. 

 **Reach**:* To date 154 practitioners in the UK have directly or indirectly benefited from training in MBCT provided by Exeter researchers. **\[5.5\]** In addition, MBCT training materials have been accessed by health care practitioners from around the world \(a list of practitioners from around the world is available at https://www.accessmbct.com\). 

 **Improved outcome and patient experience** 

 MBCT has sustained recovery in most of those not currently depressed and contributed to clinical improvement and recovery in half of those currently depressed. Testimonies from patients in Exeter’s Accessing Evidenced Based Psychological Therapies \(AccEPT\) clinic demonstrate the profound impact of MBCT, one attendee stating: “ *I am delighted to confirm that I found the MBCT course to be extremely beneficial. I can honestly say that it changed my life for the better. I had learned how to become aware of my current mood and when this was deteriorating, to make use of the mindfulness practice to get myself on an even keel again*.” **\[5.9\]** 

 **Significance**: Patient outcomes, at both local and national level, have been significantly boosted by MBCT. Since 2014, 888 patients have received the therapy within Exeter’s AccEPT clinic. Since 2014, three audits have revealed between 64\-75% of these patients showed reliable improvement and 50\-51% met criteria for reliable recovery. **\[5.10\]** Similar outcomes have been recorded at the national level; in a 2018/19 annual report the NHS found that about 50% of 3,957 patients receiving MBCT \(of whom 1,566 reported current depression\) fully recovered and 50% showed significant clinical improvement. **\[5.11\]** 

 **Reach**:* As noted above, with national access to psychological treatments expected to double, the benefits of MBCT – currently enjoyed by over 10,000 people suffering from depression in the UK – are likely to reach 20\-40,000 patients by 2024 \[prediction based on NHS Mental Health Implementation Plan 2019/20 – 2023/24, published July 2019, page 23\]. 

 **Benefits for the NHS and society** 

 In the last 10 years the number of annual prescriptions for antidepressant medication  has doubled to 70 million, and today antidepressants cost the health service an estimated £5.5 million every week. At a one\-off cost of £112 per person **\[3.2\]**, MBCT can be cheaper than long\-term antidepressant maintenance medication \(median of £49.69/year with a treatment time of 3\-5 years\), as well as alternative individual psychological treatments for depression, such as cognitive therapy \(£334/person\). Further, 87% of patients receiving MBCT were able to reduce or taper off their medication **\[3.2\]** suggesting that this therapy will yield substantial cost savings for the NHS, and for wider society, particularly when treatment adherence is accounted for. 

 **Significance**:* Long\-term cost estimation models accounting for treatment adherence \(around 80% for MBCT versus 45% for antidepressant medication\), identified MBCT as more economical than maintenance antidepressant medication, with approximately £1,300 lower costs over a 24\-month time horizon, and 0.08 higher quality\-adjusted life years \(QALYs\) \[see Pahlevan, T., et al. \(2020\) Cost\-Utility Analysis of Mindfulness\-Based Cognitive Therapy versus Antidepressant Pharmacotherapy for Prevention of Depressive Relapse in a Canadian Context. *Can J Psychiatry* 65\(8\): 568\-576\]. Furthermore, MBCT offers cost savings for wider society, in the form of, among others, improved long\-term physical health, reduced suffering, improved daily functioning \(work, parenting, interpersonal relationships\) and enhanced participation in and enjoyment of life.  Based on Layard et al.’s cost benefit analysis of psychological therapies in general, this cost saving for the society can be estimated at £19.98 million \[see Layard et al. \(2007\) Cost\-benefit analysis of psychological therapy. *National Institute Economic Review*, 202 \(1\). 90 \-98\]. 

 **Reach**:* When prescribed as an alternative to antidepressant medication MBCT has the potential to cut costs wherever implemented in the NHS, assuming practitioners are effectively trained.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Second World War \(WWII\) stands on the cusp of human memory. As those who had direct experience of it pass away, new challenges arise in the appreciation of the relevance or significance of WWII’s history and archaeology.  Historians at UEA responded to this dilemma with an educational and cultural programme intended to promote the East of England’s WWII social and military heritage. What might have been an exercise in nostalgia rapidly developed into a venture in social history, with diverse and far\-reaching benefits.  Supporting the education of adults and school children, stimulating local businesses, generating economic growth through the visitor economy, promoting wellbeing through occupational therapy, and improving museum resources not least through online media and its involvement in the development of a Tom Hanks mini\-series, our project has not only enhanced cultural heritage but permanently altered attitudes to the region’s past.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Liddiard is an internationally respected figure in the study of military landscapes and an acknowledged pioneer in the archaeology of twentieth\-century conflict zones.  Already renowned for his research on medieval castles and realising that more recent wars had bequeathed a built heritage just as significant but rather less well protected, he has increasingly turned his attention to the archaeology of WWII.  Working from within UEA’s Landscape Group, one of the leading research clusters on designed and built landscapes anywhere in the world, as Co\-Investigator in a  European Union InterReg IV venture on WWII Heritage \(2010−14, total value EUR4,216,110\) Liddiard collaborated with partners in the Netherlands, the UK, Belgium, and France, investigating and making more publicly accessible aspects of East Anglia’s WWII heritage.  From this sprang four guidebooks \(20,000 copies distributed to public and heritage outlets\), an award\-winning ‘Walberswick’ Project’ on the East coast anti\-invasion defences of WWII \(an REF2014 Impact Case Study\), two ground\-breaking articles published in 2012 \( **3.1**, **3.2**\), and a monograph by Liddiard and David Sims, *A Very Dangerous Locality: the Landscape of the Suffolk Sandlings in the Second World War* \( **3.3**\). This book was winner of the History section of the 2019 East Anglian Book Awards and described in *Rural History* \(2019\) as *‘a wonderful book … brilliantly combining archival research with field survey’*. 

 East Anglia has particular significance in WWII heritage owing to the presence in the region from 1941−45 of the United States Eighth Air Force: one of the largest such formations ever assembled. While the history of this so\-called ‘Mighty Eighth’ and its contribution to the Allied Strategic Bomber Offensive is well known \(and widely celebrated in the USA, with its own museum in Savannah Georgia\), in eastern England it has left a substantial legacy, in local memory \(now rapidly fading\), in material and archaeological remains \(still too often neglected\), and culturally in a network of volunteer\-run museums. These museums have endeavoured to preserve what can be rescued.  However, they are generally dependent upon amateur enthusiasm, with the need for generational renewal of increasingly pressing concern. 

 In order to meet this challenge, Liddiard served as founding member of a project board and subsequently as academic lead to a Heritage Lottery funded community interest project: *The Eighth in the East*, 2013\-16, which received a grant of GBP575,000, of which GBP74,874 \( **3.6**\) was channelled through UEA, with Rowena Burgess, a social historian also from the Landscape Group, as fellow member of the project board. Centred on the American ‘friendly invasion’, the project’s aims were to promote education, to undertake a programme of archaeological survey and cataloguing, and to support the network of airfield site museums. *Eighth in the East* funded a 3\-year post for a Learning Officer \(Annie Sommazzi, and subsequently Andrew Farrell, both contracted via UEA, both now in permanent employment\) to develop and deliver schools programmes. Liddiard provided academic expertise on archival material, oral history, and archaeological remains.  Nine internships were funded \(again administered through UEA\), with recipients placed chiefly at airfield museums, tasked with cataloguing primary source materials, collecting and stewarding oral historical records, and with supporting community archaeology. Liddiard undertook training of volunteers and on\-site recording. The archival and material remains thus gathered were widely publicized through a variety of media, including academic publications by Derwin Gregory \(Liddiard’s PhD student 2011−15, thereafter temporary Lecturer at UEA, now permanent Lecturer at Bishop Grosseteste University\) \( **3.4**\), and a highly\-regarded project website  [8theast.org/](https://www.8theast.org/), providing guidance to local heritage, an online legacy exhibition of photographs, story boards, podcasts, and blogs. 

 All of this work was undertaken and recorded at a time crucial to the oral history of WWII, before memories of the American presence in 1940s East Anglia entirely fade away.  While the experiences of the American aircrew who flew from the region’s airfields are well\-documented and tend to frame our view of events, *Eighth in the East* chose instead to focus on the ‘hidden histories’ of the otherwise marginalised ground personnel, including African\-American servicemen, and the many East Anglian men and women with whom they interacted.  A region regarded before 1940 as relatively isolated, between 1941 and 1945 became home to many thousands of American servicemen and women, of diverse backgrounds.  The effect here was to generate romance, tragedy, and tension in more or less equal measure.  Of this the only remains still standing are those of airfields and civic/military defence systems.  This evidence can be combined with the oral or written reports of those who were there, many of these reports now most easily accessed through the East Anglian Film Archive, stored in the Norfolk Record Office under joint UEA/Record Office management: an essential partner in the project’s work.  So successful did *Eighth in the East* prove in uncovering neglected aspects of the region’s social and military heritage that it gave rise to a legacy project, headed by Gregory, loosely grouped under the title ‘HQ\-East’, with its own social media outlets and programme of archaeological excavation, tasked in 2017−18 to investigate ‘What the American’s Left Behind in East Anglia’ \(supported by grants totalling GBP34,000, equally split between the UEA ESRC Impact Accelerator Account and the UEA Higher Education Innovation Fund allocation\). Acknowledging the potential benefits of archaeology as occupational therapy, two excavations were conducted on the site of the former airfield at Thorpe Abbotts.  Previously unknown WWII archaeological remains were discovered, written up, and published by Gregory \( **3.5**\).

 **4. Details of the Impact** 

 Through a variety of projects and subsequent spin\-offs, we have sought to contextualize and raise awareness of the East of England’s military heritage.  In so doing, we have benefitted local society and the economy more broadly, recording, enhancing, and disseminating historical records, reaching out to the tourist industry and to other local businesses, and informing those now engaged in dramatizing historical reality. 

 **Volunteers, Citizen Archaeology, Education, and Occupational Therapy** 

 *Eighth in the East* directly engaged 15,969 people, with key beneficiaries involved in the educational programme, including theatrical performances, family days, and exhibitions \(5737 visitors\). Through Liddiard and UEA, a bespoke package of historical resources was developed and disseminated, alongside a programme of outreach, including museum displays, archaeological excavation, and memorial restoration. 375 schoolchildren took part \(far in excess of the project target of 150\), either through classroom/museum activities, or outreach projects \( **5.1**, pp.69, 86\). 

 For both educators and educated this was often a watershed moment in attitudes to history and heritage. The level of engagement amongst schoolchildren drew comment.  As one museum curator put it: *‘The standard of work … was as good as any professional touring exhibition that we've hosted’* \( **5.1**, p.86\). At participating museums, 60% reported an increase in the awareness of their existence, and 40% increased school visits and raised footfall from younger age groups \( **5.1**, p.42\). At Bottisham Museum it was the innovation that struck a chord: *‘No one had thought about an education programme, doing formal lesson plans … People had studied the 8USAAF but not really with a view to teaching it to kids’* \( **5.1**, p.90\). Educational material was also placed online and made accessible via the project website and the *Times Educational Supplement* sites \(at least 5,389 views and downloads, **5.2** and **5.1**, p.88\) **.**  Of the project’s nine interns, all rated the training they received as effective, reported improved self\-confidence, and that it had helped their future careers.  On a practical level, one commented that the experience *‘allowed me to put into practice the skills I’ve learnt at university’*, another that *‘the whole experience was valuable’* \( **5.1**, p.100\). All nine moved on to employment or full\-time postgraduate study. 

 In terms of training, *Eighth in the East* directly engaged 120 volunteers to conduct archaeological surveys on 95 aviation sites \( **5.1**, p.52\), with 72% reporting that they had acquired new skills, 50% that they had subsequently used these skills elsewhere, and 97% rating their training ‘effective’ or better \( **5.1**, p.58\). Supplying local archaeology groups with the expertise with which to secure their futures, Liddiard’s training was cited here as especially decisive.  In the successor legacy project HQ\-East, occupational therapy was a central concern.  In two excavations at Thorpe Abbotts, in collaboration with the American Veterans Archaeological Recovery Programme, training was provided to 19 British and American serving and former members of the armed forces, as well as to family members. Military personnel undertook 462 volunteering hours, 98 of these hours with observation by Occupational Therapists \( **5.4**\). The benefits for those who took part were significant, one medically discharged veteran stating that she had not *‘smiled as much as she did on the excavation for a long time since her injury’*. Another participant reported that *‘these injured soldiers have spent a lot of time feeling ignored and forgotten … and to have you \(Gregory\) acknowledge her thoughts ... really helped with her confidence’* \( **5.3a**\). The Occupational Therapist observers confirmed the transformative effects on well\-being, noting that those taking part found themselves not only using skills learned in the military for new purposes, but developing new capabilities, thanks in part to the *‘accepting and non\-judgemental environment’* \( **5.4, 5.5**\). 

 **Networking, Dissemination, and Service to Museums** 

 The museums also benefitted, not least through the recruitment of new and younger volunteers.  Thorpe Abbotts airfield museum, for example, reports an increased artefact collection, increased awareness, and significantly increased footfall \( **5.3a**\). Through the dissemination of its work, the project and its legacy organisations have become the centre of an expanding network of interest groups, acting as a connector and facilitator in ways not originally envisaged. Global reach is evidenced through social media. By July 2020 \( **5.6\)**, posts on the legacy project HQ\-East’s Twitter feed \(followed by 4,677 individuals located in 89 different countries\) had reached 6,048,685 people worldwide.  A further 1,290,359 were reached via Facebook \(1,126 followers\); whilst 17,322 individuals follow the Instagram account.  A survey of online viewers demonstrates the tangible benefits of this network, with 32% of respondents indicating that they have visited a regional museum as a result of their website use, and a further 44% reporting that the project had changed the way they think not only about the United States Army Air Forces \(USAAF\) in East Anglia but about twentieth\-century heritage sites more generally \( **5.6\)**.  This has brought further benefits to a range of national and regional organisations, not just in heritage but for the local economy. The internationally important American Air Museum \(a subsidiary of Imperial War Museum, Duxford, 2019 footfall 401,287, **5.6**\) uses the project’s site as a principal platform from which to share its collections with the public \( **5.3c\)**.  As reported by the American Air Museum’s Web Engagement Officer, without its own social media accounts, the Museum depends upon Liddiard and Gregory’s site as *‘the way its \(29,000\+\) photos are shared regularly with target audiences around the world’*.  In turn, this has led *‘to corrections and improvements to the Imperial War Museum’s catalogue records’* \( **5.3c\)**. 

 **Local Business, the Visitor Economy, and Advice to Media** 

 As a hub for a range of interest groups, our various projects have promoted historic tourism and facilitated the creation of business networks.  In 2018, we hosted a corporate and educational event at Norwich Airport attended by representatives of 30 local businesses and enlivened by cockpit tours of one of the few still airworthy Spitfires \(MH434, built in 1943\).  Described by Barclays Bank as *‘an exceptional event’* impossible without the project’s support, this brought Barclays *‘new business opportunities in the aviation and technology sectors’* \( **5.7a**\), not least with SaxonAir Charter, whose letter \( **5.7b**\) notes the event’s *‘superb’* organisation, and the unprecedented opportunities arising here for networking and new contacts.  As a result of such enterprise, the not\-for\-profit business\-led private company Visit East of England developed a ‘Friendly Invasion’ tourist package. This resulted in the award of GBP237,000 from the Discover England Fund, towards a GBP387,000 ‘Friendly Invasion’ campaign. By 2019, this campaign was able to estimate a likely future uplift of 40% in US visitors, and the development of high and medium cost tour packages *‘of a kind that had never sold before’* \( **5.8**\). On average, each American tourist spends GBP930 per visit to the UK, excluding flights \( **5.9**\), suggesting a significant boost to the visitor economy. It also brought our project into direct conjunction with what in due course will become an Apple TV Plus miniseries, ‘Masters of the Air’, intended as a third part to the Tom Hanks/Stephen Spielberg WWII series, ‘Band of Brothers’ and ‘The Pacific’.  Gregory was closely involved in discussions here, including presentations of his research to executives from Playtone \(Tom Hanks’ production company\), to the scriptwriter, and to the author of the underpinning narrative \(Don Miller\).  Five thousand copies of a publication produced by Visit East of England, drawing upon our project’s research, with a foreword by the Duke of Cambridge and Tom Hanks, were freely distributed to museums in the US, including the National WWII Museum in New Orleans and the National Mighty Eighth Museum in Savannah Georgia \( **5.8**\), and Tom Hanks is reported to have *‘turned his office into what looks like an Eighth Air Force museum, complete with model airplanes hanging from the ceiling’* \( **5.10\)**.  Planned outcomes have been seriously affected by COVID\-19 with filming, originally scheduled to begin in 2020, twice postponed.  In due course, nonetheless, the heritage central to Liddiard and Gregory’s work is to be broadcast internationally to an audience far larger than anything imaginable when our project was first conceived. 

 With or without Hollywood glitz, our project has benefitted a range of audiences in diverse ways.  In the words of the independent evaluation report for *Eighth in the East*, it has *‘made an extremely positive difference to this history and the people of the East of England \(and beyond\) through training and education, participation and engagement’* \( **5.1**, p.3\).  Inspiring, training, and informing a future generation of enthusiasts, it has helped preserve the memory of an extraordinary socio\-historical phenomenon not just in terms of written or recorded testimony but as a built environment.  In due course, such landscapes may seem to future generations as significant and as iconic as the medieval castle or the once similarly neglected monuments of the Industrial Age.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 As a result of University of Bristol \(UoB\) research, billions of farmed fish annually worldwide have improved welfare at slaughter. UoB was the first to identify and measure welfare problems with slaughter by asphyxiation in air or on ice, or gill cutting and bleed\-out while still conscious; they proceeded to develop proven humane stunning techniques. Their collaborative research with industry has pioneered commercial stunning equipment now used worldwide for salmon and trout and enabled humane mass slaughter with improved productivity and fish quality. Concurrently, the research has led to significant changes in policy worldwide, including the World Organisation for Animal Health \(OIE\) guidelines, RSPCA welfare standards, the Soil Association’s and Naturland’s international organic standards. Affecting a wide range of fish species, these policies all follow UoB’s research by recommending stunning before slaughter. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Pioneering research at the University of Bristol \(UoB\) has led the way in evaluating the welfare of farmed salmon and trout at the time of slaughter. Studies support the view that fish are sentient animals that can feel pain. It has been shown, for instance, that given the choice, fish will access analgesics to alleviate pain. To be considered humane, a killing method must render the fish immediately unconscious, unaware of any pain, and that this condition should persist until death. 

 Research by the UoB group in the early 2000s, led by Dr Kestin, was the first to establish that there was a welfare problem with the then prevalent methods of fish slaughter \[1\]. By monitoring the electrical activity of fish brains, they established that fish take a long time to die with the commercial methods of handling and slaughter used at the time. These included leaving fish to die a slow, painful death in air or in ice slurry, or gill cutting without stunning, which results in fish remaining conscious whilst slowly dying from blood loss \[2\]. 

 The UoB team developed protocols for assessing welfare of fish at the time of slaughter \[3\], focussing on indicators of consciousness, such as respiration, eyes responding to light, checking whether the eyes move with movement of fish \(conscious fish maintain their eyes horizontal when the body is turned, termed ‘righting mechanism’\) and twitching in response to pinching. In experimental work, electroencephalograms provided the gold standard against which to benchmark these methods of assessing consciousness, which are easier to use in a commercial situation. Using these welfare protocols, the researchers found percussive or electrical stunning to be the principal humane methods of slaughter. Electrical stunning also has the potential to reduce handling of conscious fish. From a welfare perspective, electrocution \(which may both stun and kill a fish instantaneously\) is ideal, but there are potential commercial disadvantages in that it can affect flesh quality by causing, for example, blood spots and broken bones. 

 Thus, the body of work not only compared different methods of welfare assessment, handling and slaughter, but also investigated the consequences for the whole fish, its flesh quality and shelf life to ensure acceptability to the aquaculture industry. It was necessary to determine which electrical parameters of the equipment used to electrically stun fish would be effective in terms of fish welfare but without commercial downsides. Systematic experimental studies determined that the duration of stun application, plus the frequency and magnitude of the current, were important for how long trout remained stunned and whether or not they were humanely killed \[4\]. Further work on salmon \[5\] led to a better understanding of the electrical parameters needed to produce unconsciousness \(animals that lose consciousness quickly are unaware of subsequent procedures used to kill them and do not feel pain: hence this is deemed humane\). Follow\-on research on electrical stunning specifically investigated flesh quality, including new species, such as turbot \[6\] and sea bass \[7\]. LINK\-funded research \[iii\] by UoB and Silsoe Livestock Systems Ltd with industrial partners The Co\-operative Group \(CWS\) Ltd, Waitrose Ltd, Ace Aquatec, Kames Fish Farming Ltd, Shetland Halibut Co. Ltd, together with the Humane Slaughter Association and funding from Defra, moved from stunning in fresh water to electrical stunning in sea water of farmed halibut, extending both species and water type. 

 This body of research, along with research conducted in development with a commercial partner, laid the foundation for practical, welfare\-friendly methods of killing the billions of fish \(more than all other food animals\) farmed globally.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Production of the six top species groups of farmed fish was estimated at 48.5 million tonnes in 2018 \(Food and Agriculture Organisation \(FAO\)\)**Footnote:**

 [http://www.fao.org/3/ca9383en/ca9383en.pdf](http://www.fao.org/3/ca9383en/ca9383en.pdf) 
, representing many billions of individuals. These species are grouped as: carps and barbels; tilapias; catfish; salmons, trouts and smelts; freshwater fishes; and marine perch\-like species, which include sea bass and sea bream. Total global production of farmed Atlantic salmon alone, the focus of initial UoB research, is estimated to comprise 200,000,000 fish \(2.5 million tonnes in 2018, \( [FAO](http://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/market-reports/resource-detail/en/c/1189947/)\)\). 

 Research at UoB \(2000 – 2020\) alerted animal welfare charities, government agencies and fish producers to problems with existing slaughter practices within aquaculture fish production. Moreover, the work \[4\-7\] identified practicable solutions to achieving an instantaneous loss of consciousness via electrical stunning which represents a more humane method of slaughter than those previously used. Thanks to the evidence base provided by this work, electrical stunners are now used around the world on salmon, trout, turbot and sea bass \[2\-7\]. The use of stunners on pangasius \(catfish\), sea bream, yellowtail, carp and barramundi is currently under investigation by UoB with industrial partners in an Humane Slaughter Association project \(see below\), thus the work has successfully reached species from five of the six top groups of farmed fish, and beyond. Thanks to the specification of the new humane methods of stunning at slaughter by international standards, awareness of the methods is global, even if they are not always implemented \(e.g. where farms are too small in scale for the equipment to be practical\). Further, the UoB research team has collaborated with a commercial partner, Ace Aquatec, to develop stunning equipment. This, in turn, has opened up new markets and increased staff \(recently doubling in number\) and sales from European, Australian and South American regional offices for Ace Aquatec \[I\]. 

 **Impacts on national and international policy: food and animal welfare standards** 

 To reassure consumers, most food derived from animals, including fish, complies with standards that ensure high standards of hygiene and animal health and welfare. The UK is the EU’s biggest producer of farmed salmon, the focus of earlier UoB research \[2,5\], and is responsible for 163 thousand tonnes of salmon each year \(\~15 million fish\), 90% by volume of total EU production and 8% of the global market. Over 70% of UK salmon producers adopt RSPCA Assured welfare standards, which require certificate holders to ensure good welfare practices at slaughter. These practices reflect the UoB team’s research; Kestin of the UoB group contributed to the RSPCA’s guidelines on fish welfare at slaughter for farmed Atlantic salmon, which were updated in 2018 \[A\] and are still informed by UoB work. The UoB team further influenced retailer standards, opening up the use of electrical stunning to more species investigated by UoB, including trout \[4\] and sea bass \[7\]. For example, Waitrose, the retailer with the greatest market share of fish in the UK \(1.9 million fish/year\), requires that “ *All our farmed salmon, sea farmed rainbow trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, sea bass, sea bream and halibut are stunned prior to slaughter*.” \[Bi\]. Both Waitrose and the Co\-op were partners in Link\-funded research \[iii\] which extended the range of species that could be effectively and practicably stunned, given the widely differing responses between species to stunning, and also investigated stunning in sea water \(Waitrose was also a partner in \[ii\]\). The Co\-op standards also require that fish are stunned before slaughter \[Bii\]. 

 The Farm Animal Welfare Committee \(FAWC\), the expert committee to Defra and the Devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales, and which informs UK legislation and practice, produced a report in 2014, ‘Opinion on the Welfare of Farmed Fish at the Time of Killing’ \[C\]. The report is based predominantly on UoB’s research: 13 of its 20 references come from their work. The 2018 Humane Slaughter Association \(HSA, the UK charity concerned exclusively with promoting humane treatment of all food animals worldwide\) report ‘Humane Slaughter of Farmed Finfish around the world’ \[D\] acknowledges the leading work at UoB, “ *Two common methods of stunning fish, currently considered to be the most humane and globally acceptable for food safety, are electrical and percussive stunning. Both methods are already in\-use in the rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon industries, respectively, and the stunning parameters are based on scientific recommendations \(e.g. Robb et al, 2002b* \[4\] *\)*”. The report notes how methodologies for welfare assessment, humane stunning and stun\-kill are continually being refined and extended to include other fish species \[D\]. 

 UoB research continues to inform EU practice and is widely cited \(seven references\) in a 2017 review \[E\] funded by the European Commission. This report also notes that “ *The OIE and EFSA’s Scientific Opinions \(2009\) on the key fish species, provide a useful point of reference*” \(Executive Summary\). The EFSA 2009 report on salmon cites nine UoB papers whilst its trout report seven key papers from UoB research \(including \[1\-6\]\). Other international food standards that insist on humane slaughter \(stunning before kill\) include the Global Aquaculture Alliance’s Best Aquaculture Practices \(GAABAP, 2017\) \[Fii\], which base their stunning and killing on a review citing seven papers from UoB research \(including \[1,3,5\]\), and the Soil Association’s Aquaculture standards \[Fiii\], which are underpinned by the UoB\-informed FAWC guidelines \[C\]. A 2009 report published by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture \(FiBL\), ‘Stunning and slaughter methods for edible fish’, cites 13 UoB papers and forms an important part of the evidence base used by Naturland’s Standards for Organic Aquaculture \(latest version 2020\) \[Fv\]; Naturland is a major international association for organic agriculture. 

 An increasing number of worldwide standards are adopting guidelines for stunning before slaughter, not only of salmonids \(salmon and trout\), but also of other farmed fish species. The scientific evidence base for these policy changes includes the pioneering studies by UoB. For example, the World Organisation for Animal Health \(OIE\) publishes an Aquatic Animal Health Code for its 181 member countries, which states: "" *farmed fish should be stunned before killing, and the stunning method should ensure immediate and irreversible loss of consciousness”* and recommends electrical stunning for “ *carp, eel, salmonids*” \(OIE, 2019\) \[G\]. A review undertaken for the OIE by Lines \(of UoB\) and Spence \(2014\) \[H\] provided the evidence base for the Aquatic Animal Health Code and cites 11 references from the UoB team, including \[1\-6\]. A 2017 assessment of uptake of OIE guidelines, produced for the European Commission by the IBF Consortium \(cited in the HSA report \[D\]\), estimated that “ *best practices are mostly achieved, with a few exceptions*” for Atlantic salmon produced in the European Economic Area. 

#  Economic impacts: industry collaboration and commercialisation of fish stunning equipment 

 Having developed validated methods for measuring fish welfare at slaughter and defined the principal factors to achieve effective stun with fish in the laboratory, the next step for the UoB group was to upscale the stunning method for commercial settings. Robust and effective stunning equipment was needed to cope with large numbers and rapid processing of fish \(line speed in major UK farmed salmon processing factories may be 4,000 per hour, with fish weighing 10\-12kg each\). This was achieved through Kestin, Knowles and Lines’ research collaboration from 2001 with Ace Aquatec Ltd \(AA\), producers of aquaculture and marine technologies. Kestin introduced AA to the concept of electrical stunning at an industry meeting and, together, UoB and AA went on to develop and test the first prototype in\-line electrical stun systems for the humane commercial killing of farmed salmon and trout \[I\]. 

 Development work between AA and UoB is ongoing, both in\-house and via externally funded research, including GBP721,580 awarded in 2019 by the charity the Humane Slaughter Association to implement in\-water electrical stunning in aquaculture of Nile tilapia, Pangasius \(catfish\), gilthead sea bream, yellowtail and possibly carp \[I\]. 

 As a result of contributions from UoB, AA is now an award\-winning and major provider of humane fish slaughter equipment; in 2019, its Humane Stunner Universal \(HSU\) technology won a Queen’s award to industry for Enterprise Innovation, while in 2017 it was awarded the Innovation Award at Aqua Nor, the world’s largest aquaculture industry fair. HSU is now in use on farms around the world, including in Chile, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, Greece, USA and Canada \[Ii\]. Before UoB involvement, AA’s core business was seal deterrents for salmon farms. The company has experienced significant growth as a result of introducing the humane slaughter equipment into its product line. AA’s CEO sums up the considerable commercial impacts of the stunning equipment as including: “ *new regional offices in Chile, Norway, and Australia; investment … this year totalling over £4m; doubling of staff from 10 to 20 employees in six months; addition of new species to our stunning capabilities, including bream, tilapia, and prawns … The company has grown from a family run business in 2008 with a handful of deterrents sold each year, to an international business with recurring rental revenue of £2m, with an aim to double each year*.” \[Ii\]. AA has increased its net assets from GBP299,904 in 2015 to GBP3,545,347 in December 2019 \[Iii\], with sales of its humane slaughter equipment making a major contribution. AA also report that the electrical stunning equipment brings sustainability benefits, having “ *reduced waste going to landfill and provided an income to farmers/suppliers where otherwise there was an expense for removal and destruction. These products are now supplying high end restaurants and pet food where before the use of anaesthetic required them to go to landfill*.” \[Ii\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Copyright law governs the use of a wide range of cultural materials. In the digital age, it is increasingly difficult to know whether these materials can be used, and how permissions should be sought. UofG research has: \(i\) produced evidence to inform the EU copyright debate. From 2015 onwards, Kretschmer coordinated an academic response to proposed EU legislation, which persuaded a majority of MEPs to reject the first negotiation mandate for the Copyright Directive in 2018. The research: \(ii\) supported amendments to articles 5, 11 & 13, which protect the rights of EU citizens over corporate interests. The same research underpins one of the UK’s leading copyright guidance websites, which has: \(iii\) shaped the creative policy and practice of copyright ‘users’ within the creative sector via engagement with the British Film Institute. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Almost every activity on a mobile phone, computer or network involves acts of copying. Copyright law has effects that go far beyond its origins of regulating the behaviour of competitors in the same industry sector \(e.g. such as protecting a publisher against a re\-publisher\). It now affects the infrastructure of society, and the role of creators and users as citizens. CREATe, the UK Copyright and Creative Economy Centre \(hosted by the UofG School of Law\), was established in 2012 to enable a new evidence\-led understanding of copyright law. 

 **2.1. Reconceiving the ‘users’ of copyright** 

 CREATe researchers have studied how to enable the creative sector to develop a much wider range of behavioral options relating to copyright. In 2015, an assessment **\[O1\]** was undertaken across six artistic mediums: music, film, performance, visual art, writing and interactive development. It sought to understand creators, entrepreneurs, educators and consumers as ‘users’ of copyright. The research identified and quantified obstacles to creative re\-use that arise from misunderstandings of the boundaries of copyright law **\[O2\]** and proposed specific interventions to release the value of the creative re\-use of material \(e.g. increasing the amount of material available in the public domain through legislation; improving knowledge about the boundaries of copyright law among creators; and improving information flow between creative industries and holders of public domain materials\). These recommendations were implemented by UofG researchers in the development of the UK online guidance portal  [<ins>CopyrightUser.org</ins>](https://www.copyrightuser.org/) \(led by CREATe\). 

  

 **2.2. The EU Copyright Directive** 

 When the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive was proposed by the European Commission in September 2016, CREATe undertook a series of evidence reviews and empirical studies **\[O3, O4, O5, O6\]** relating to the most controversial provisions in the draft legislation. The research found that evidence did not support provisions in Articles 5, 11 and 13, which sought to alter the balance between protecting and rewarding rightholders and facilitating user innovation. 

 Article 5 \(which later became Articles 3 and 4\) proposed a new narrow exception that was designed to enable copying of materials in the process of text\-and\-data\-mining. However, the exception was restricted to purposes of scientific research \(thus excluding cultural heritage institutions, journalists and commercial start\-ups\). Margoni and Kretschmer’s research **\[O4\]** showed that text\-and\-data\-mining is misconceived as a copyright relevant activity, as the purpose of mining is extracting information from works, not copying the works. 

 Article 11 \(later Article 15\), proposed that *anyone* using snippets of journalistic online content must first get a licence from the publisher, potentially affecting everyday activities such as blogging and hyperlinking. Along with Professor Lionel Bently \(University of Cambridge\) and others, Kretschmer was commissioned by the European Parliament to review the laws of seven Member States to see how far the proposed new articles would ‘add value’ **\[O5\]**. The desk work was executed primarily by the University of Cambridge, with a subcontract given to Prof. Kretschmer, who drew extensively upon the body of empirical evidence from CREATe research. A key finding was that previous interventions to establish press publishers’ rights in Germany and Spain did not produce the intended effects \(e.g. enforcing the rights of publishers and generating income from US tech companies\). It also found that the proposal favoured incumbent publishing interests over innovation \(e.g. the interests of quality journalism, small publishers or news\-related start\-ups\) **.** 

 Article 13 \(later Article 17\) proposed to change the liability regime so that platforms that host user\-generated content \(e.g. YouTube\) would become responsible for unlawful content found on their sites. A likely consequence of such proposals would be the introduction of large\-scale upload filtering software—a burden that would likely discourage start\-ups and effectively lock\-in YouTube’s dominance. Automated takedown would struggle to tell copyright infringement apart from legal uses such as parody; as a result, legitimate content would be removed, thus affecting creative freedoms. Kretschmer and Erickson’s research **\[O6\]** investigated the factors that motivate takedown requests of user\-generated content by copyright owners using an original dataset of 1,839 music video parodies. The research found that takedown requests by copyright holders already results in the removal of lawful content, and that policy concerns frequently raised by rightholders are not associated with statistically significant patterns of action.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1. Context** 

 Copyright policy has suffered from the lack of an accepted evidence base. It is a highly technical field of law that, through digitization, is suddenly implicated in everyday life. The debate around the EU Commission's proposals for copyright reform \(2015−2019\) was played out amid intense corporate lobbying aimed at MEPs, governments and the general public. The face\-off between US tech companies \(e.g. Google\) versus European collecting societies, record companies and press publishers, led to widespread accusations of deception and unfair lobbying. Amid this confusion, there was a real danger that the interests of EU citizens would be drowned out. 

 **4.2. Informing the EU copyright debate** 

 CREATe’s interdisciplinary research has provided EU citizens and policymakers with a trusted source of information during the course of this complex debate \(as demonstrated by the report on corporate lobbying **\[E1\]**\). Kretschmer also disseminated research findings and advocated CREATe’s evidence\-led approach through invited presentations at hearings in the European Parliament and at high\-level roundtables for the European Commission \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[E2\]**\). A key recommendation of the research **\[O1\]** was to support innovation by increasing the amount of material available for re\-use without seeking permission. When the final study **\[O1\]** was published in 2015, it fed into a European Parliament review of the 2001 Copyright Directive. The then Rapporteur cited the research in Parliament and endorsed its role in safeguarding public domain works for the benefit of EU society: *‘the empirical results generated by the CREATe study helped my colleagues and I advocate for change to European copyright that will improve the regulatory landscape for creators and users.’* \(confirmed by letter **\[E3\]**\). 

 When controversial new legislation was introduced by the European Commission in September 2016, Kretschmer drew upon the underpinning research to coordinate an academic response to the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive. CREATe’s  [<ins>digital portal</ins>](https://www.create.ac.uk/policy-responses/eu-copyright-reform/) **\[E4\]** became a focal point for this activity, providing a hub for the dissemination of academic statements and the findings of CREATe’s most relevant research **\[O2, O3, O4\]**. As a result of the initiative of Kretschmer \(and others\), over 200 academics signed open letters opposing Articles 11 and 13. These interventions also advocated opening Article 5 \(which became Articles 3 and 4: exceptions for text\-and\-data\-mining\) to all users, including for commercial purposes \(confirmed by open letters **\[E5\]**\). 

 Kretschmer then co\-authored an academic statement entitled ‘Misinformation and Independent Enquiry’ \(known as the CREATe Statement **\[E6\]**\), which received over 40,000 impressions on Twitter. This was a key piece of evidence that persuaded a majority of MEPs to reject the first negotiation mandate for the Directive in the  [<ins>vote on 5 July 2018</ins>](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180628IPR06809/parliament-to-review-copyright-rules-in-september). This rejection was highly significant, as it represented a surprise result in the face of extensive corporate lobbying \(e.g. Google alone held 22 meetings with high\-level European Commission staff specifically on copyright\). With the Commission’s proposals sent back to the drawing board by Parliament, the then Shadow Copyright Rapporteur wrote: *‘I cannot stress enough that I think the active academic intervention in this vote has been absolutely decisive for this first success’* **\[E7\]**. 

 **4.3. Supporting amendments to the EU Copyright Directive** 

 As the result of the research and interventions of CREATe \(and others\), specific changes were made to the Copyright Directive prior to the vote in respect of Article 11, and subsequent to the vote in respect of Articles 5 and 13. For example, the European Parliament commissioned study **\[O5\]** was presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs \(JURI\) on 7 December 2017 **\[E2\]**. Its concerns that the reform would give big media players the power to monetize their content online \(at a cost to the circulation of news\) were reflected in an explicit exemption for ‘hyperlinking’ introduced by Parliament to the Commission draft \(and further amendments that remove ‘individual words or short extracts’ and ‘private or non\-commercial uses’ from the scope of the new right\). 

 For Articles 5 and 13, the European Parliament introduced later amendments that enabled the rejected draft to pass plenary votes \(on 11 September 2018 and 26 March 2019 respectively\). For Article 5, the scope of the text\-and\-data\-mining exception was extended to embrace cultural heritage institutions \(in line with the findings of **\[O4\]**\). For Article 13, obligations were re\-focused on major platforms \(e.g. YouTube\). In line with the findings of the underpinning research **\[O6\]**, exemptions were provided for ‘microenterprises and small\-sized enterprises, educational or scientific repositories’ under a new definition of an ‘online content\-sharing service provider’ introduced as Article 2\(6\). 

 The amended Copyright Directive was approved by the European Parliament on 26 March 2019 and the European Council on 15 April 2019. While the revised provisions remain problematic, a former MEP and Copyright Rapporteur of the Internal Market Committee confirms that, *‘Prof. Kretschmer’s research underpinned the case for innovation\-enabling improvements’* \(statement **\[E8\]**\). She \(and other MEPs\) relied upon academic evidence throughout the highly\-complex debate \(as confirmed by transcript **\[E9\]**\). Statement **\[E8\]** specifically confirms the role of the empirical evidence provided by the underpinning UofG research **\[O4, O5, O6\]** within that process: *‘The importance of academic input into the copyright debate was essential due to the polarised nature of the debate and the power of those right holders’ lobbies who were not supporting creators but profit. Without academic input, there would have been little counter argument particularly as the subject is complex and legalistic.’* 

 **4.4. Shaping the creative policy and practice of copyright users** 

 Based upon the underpinning research **\[O1, O2\]**, CREATe’s  [CopyrightUser.org](https://www.copyrightuser.org/) web portal has become one of the UK’s most authoritative copyright guidance sites, attracting more than 1,661,003 unique visitors since 2017 **\[E10\]**. This resource enables educators and cultural heritage practitioners to access independent copyright guidance based upon up\-to\-date empirical evidence. Its success has been widely recognized. For example, the European Commission commissioned the Council of Europe’s European Audiovisual Observatory to carry out an independent study to identify the most significant media literacy projects carried out since 2010—CopyrightUser.org was in the top 5 for the UK in 2016 **\[E11\]**. 

 As a direct result of engagement with CopyrightUser.org, there is evidence of changes to policy and practice within the cultural heritage sector. For instance, based upon the underpinning research **\[O1\]**, Meletti was seconded to the British Film Institute \(BFI\) from 2017–2018. The BFI hosts the largest public searchable database dedicated to British films released in the UK. This flagship platform for the BFI’s mass digitization project has received over 74 million views to date. As a result of Meletti’s secondment, the BFI reappraised its copyright policy, guidance and staff training \(as confirmed by statement **\[E12\]**\). The BFI’s Rights Database Manager testifies that, *‘links to pages on Copyrightuser.org have been embedded in our internal policy and guidance documents to help provide more information and context on copyright research \[…\] Approximately 35 members of BFI staff have used guidance \[…\] Using Copyrightuser.org in this way helps us particularly where we are unable to give legal advice but can direct people to the resources on the website so they can gather more information about the issues’.* **\[E12\]** 

 The secondary beneficiaries of the BFI’s revised copyright guidance are its members and partner organisations. These changes enable creators \(e.g. filmmakers and educators\) to use archive material more readily in their creative projects. For instance, in 2017 the BFI supported a pilot project to supply films to students for creative reuse. The project has since grown across the UK and Ireland and now provides 60 Higher Education Institutions with access to 39 titles for creative projects. The BFI’s Rights Database Manager confirms that, *‘The ongoing impact of \[Meletti’s\] secondment and continued use of Copyrightuser.org \[…\] has brought positive changes to the BFI for both our internal development of clearer and evidence\-based copyright policies and how we communicate with partners and the public to deliver our public mission.’* **\[E12\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Environment Agency has used Brooks’ digitised cliff analysis methodology \(REF1\) and her position on one of their Technical Assurance Groups to provide quality\-assured guidance issued to coastal authorities in England and Wales in order to effectively manage shoreline retreat. 

 Brooks’ research was used in the Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership 2020 Report Card. These reports are acted upon by decision makers within the government and are part of the evidence base to inform the next UK Climate Change Risk Assessment and National Adaptation Plans. 

 Brooks’ input on the £20m \(GBP20,000,000\) Bacton Sandscaping project has raised awareness of the need to protect East Anglia’s coastal communities, tourism interests, habitats of rare species, multiple local businesses, and numerous commercial and intellectual stakeholders in addition to protecting the Bacton Gas Terminal itself, part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure supplying a third of the UK’s gas annually. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Storms create serious problems for coastal managers because they inflict damage on infrastructure and communities and are unpredictable. Brooks’ research aims to understand the consequences of storm impacts and whether shorelines can recover naturally. Cliff retreat is one crucial aspect because a\) cliffs cannot recover once removed; and b\) cliff retreat delivers thousands of tonnes of sediment into the nearshore zone, particularly in response to climate change\-related sea level rise, a key area of focus for Brooks’ research. Brooks won a prestigious Leverhulme Fellowship in 2014 \(between October 2015 and August 2016\), and generated publications on surge impacts \(eg: REF3\), including correspondence in Nature. 

 Early underpinning research in the 1990s was in collaboration with Professor Malcolm Anderson at the University of Bristol, and Professor Mike Crozier at the University of Wellington, New Zealand which began a new way of thinking about how and why hillslopes fail, transforming the way that both academics and practitioners understand and work with the natural behaviour of slopes. 

 Current research delves into the complexity of shoreline change through cliff erosion, being driven by the combination of still water levels and wave activity, both of which increase during storms \(REF4\). It also tackles the critical issue of sea level rise in setting the baseline conditions for storm impacts, showing how storm impacts will increase in future. For coastal managers to respond effectively to erosion the research findings of current and future storm impacts have proven invaluable, especially for East Anglian coastal managers where erosion is a serious threat. To provide the highest possible value to stakeholders, the underpinning research has followed two main avenues. 

 Following a grant of £9,000 \(GBP9,000\) from the Crown Estate \(2009\) for her project on cliff recession, sediment supply and bathymetric change on the Suffolk coast, Brooks developed, calibrated and applied a shoreline response model to rapidly retreating cliffs \(REF5\), retreating up to 7 metres per year \(REF6\). The model can generate future shoreline locations under different future emissions scenarios \(UK Climate Impacts Programme; UKCiP09\). It couples the Digital Shoreline Analysis System \(DSAS\) of the United States Geological Survey \(Thieler et al., 2017\) to a shoreline response module, which can plot future shorelines in real space. It includes different sea level rise expectations for future planning epochs \(eg: Environment Agency use 2025, 2055 and 2105\). These shoreline predictions are used to establish land loss in internationally important habitats such as the National Nature Reserves of Suffolk \(that have been designated as RAMSAR sites for special protection under European legislation, as well as being Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Sites of Special Scientific Interest, as national designations\). Used with terrestrial and airborne laser scanning, the predictions also enable quantification of sediment release from retreating cliffs. 

 A second aspect is Brooks’ work on complex barrier coasts such as North Norfolk, which uses a contemporary and historic big data approach to investigate large\-scale shoreline change \(REF1\) in sites extremely vulnerable to sea flooding during storms and surges \(REF3\). The back\-barrier area is populated and infrastructure is at risk. Brooks has developed a methodology combining cross\-shore transects \(since 1992\), aerial photographs, DSAS, field\-based Real Time Kinematic \(RTK\) survey and aerial Light Detection And Ranging \(LiDAR\) resources \(REF1\). This research has identified high\-magnitude storms since 2006, demonstrated their shoreline impacts, and shown the co\-variance with forcing conditions using temporal data sets on wave heights and water levels. The 5 December 2013 surge \(the largest event for 60 years\) spawned a research approach that focuses on the alongshore variation in storm impacts and subsequent recovery showing sections of coast that recover easily and contrasting them with those that don’t \(REF2\). This data\-rich methodological approach is currently being used to study cliff and beach impacts from the 2018 “Beast from the East”, driven by a Sudden Stratospheric Warming \(SSW\) which generated the largest onshore waves since 2009 \(when wave records began on the UK East coast\). This research is quantifying beach lowering and cliff retreat in front of the Bacton Gas Terminal, an installation of major national strategic importance. 

 Both areas of research have had instrumental and capacity building impacts through development of new methodological approaches which allow evaluation of shoreline morphological change \(through Digital Elevation Models \(DEMs\) of Difference\) together with storm forcing data \(winds, waves, water levels\). Insights have benefitted coastal planners, policy makers, communities, national infrastructure and habitats in coastal areas, through early warning and evacuation planning for floods, and shoreline protection strategies for erosion.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Brooks’ new methodological approaches allow coastal planners and policy makers \(including the UK National Government\) to evaluate shoreline morphological change. They have directly informed both planning for early warning and evacuation and flood\-related issues, and protection strategies for shoreline erosion. Meanwhile, Brooks’ work on managing cliff recession is helping to build a picture of how the Bacton Sandscaping project is progressing and its role in nationally strategic shoreline protection. 

 **The Environment Agency** 

 One of the Environment Agency’s \(EA\) key functions is to provide evidence and advice to inform government policy and support others to develop risk management skills and capacity. It is the leading authority for managing the UK shorelines and, in its capacity as expert advisor, provides advice to all local planning authorities in the UK on planning applications, local plans and environmental assessments. 

 A 2017 Environment Agency report on cliff recession on the Anglian coastal monitoring area \(1\) cites Brooks’ research when it notes the rising concern of risk to the public due to coastal erosion. Brooks has shown an average cliff retreat rate of up to 7 metres per year at Covehithe and 12\-15 metres for individual storms. The report demonstrates the risk of erosion on this stretch of coastline, while underlining Brooks’ contribution to strategies to combat it. Additionally, rising sea levels are threatening coastal habitats, putting internationally important species at risk. The habitats are natural sea defences, nurse fish stocks and have recreational value, while East Anglia’s cliffs are some of Europe’s fastest eroding. This information is making a difference to the new generation of Shoreline Management Plans \(SMPs\) for the area, where managed realignment is now preferred over hold the line or no active intervention \(as stated in the SMP 7, Section 8: Plan updates\). 

 The 2017 report drew heavily on Brooks’ data and analysis of cliff retreat, noting that Brooks is one of the few researchers drawing attention to the issue, despite its national importance. The report recommends that employing a similar methodology to the digitised cliff top position method developed by Brooks in 2010 would provide a more thorough overview of recession changes \(1\). Moreover, Brooks provides “additional insight into the trends and patterns of movement over time, in particular the observation that erosion rates have increased in recent years” \(1\). Following its publication, the report was used to communicate risk to local communities and as evidence of the differences between the observed erosion rates and those quoted in various SMPs. The latter point is especially important because SMPs are the primary method by which local authorities manage coastal erosion. 

 Following publication of the 2017 report, in September 2019 Brooks was invited to join one of the Environment Agency’s Technical Assurance groups as part of their remit in providing quality advice. The main goal is to map and model the sensitivity of coastal cliff erosion to future relative sea level rise around Wales and England, over the next hundred years. Major users of the Environment Agency’s technical assurance include all Local Authorities with unprotected cliffs, landowners with large estates on the coast, and organisations such as the National Trust. The National Trust in particular is being kept informed by the Technical Assurance group: an example of a partner with hundreds of miles of coastline under their stewardship \(2\). 

 **The Bacton Sandscaping Project** 

 Brooks’ research has particular relevance to the ongoing management of the easily\-erodible shorelines of East Anglia, as shown in her involvement in monitoring sand movement following ‘sandscaping’ of the coast near Bacton. The East Anglian coastline is of strategic importance to the UK because it houses the Bacton Gas Terminal \(as well as the Sizewell nuclear power plant, currently planning for expansion\), which supplies a third of the UK’s gas annually. It is also relevant as a popular tourist destination, boasting sandy beaches, rare wildlife, and attracting around 140,000,000 day trippers annually, bringing in £10bn \(GBP10,000,000,000\) and supporting 240,000 jobs per year:  [https://www.visiteastofengland.com/business\-tradeGrowing\_tourism\_directly\_employs\_around\_240000\_people](https://www.visiteastofengland.com/business-trade) \(4\). Moreover, her research has been essential to communicating the importance of the Bacton project to the public and to ensuring that it achieves its aims; e.g. a *Conversation* article reporting on the project used Brooks’ research on southern North Sea storm surges \(REF4\) \(3\) – later picked up by *Yahoo\! News* and *Phys.org* \- to contextualise the need for the project. In July 2019, the BBC interviewed Brooks about the project \(4\), on the recommendation of Royal Haskoning DHV – the company that designed the scheme. 

 The 2012 Kelling to Lowestoft Ness Shoreline Management Plan covering the Bacton area \(5\) previously advocated a “Hold the Line” approach to coastal defence in the Bacton area using fixed groynes and to hold the beach in place. However, Brooks’ research has consistently provided evidence that “Hold the Line” is not necessarily the best approach for rapidly eroding soft sediment coastlines. The new mobile sandscaping scheme chosen for future protection of the Bacton Gas Terminal is directly in line with what Brooks research recommends. 

 Historically, the Bacton Gas Terminal was defended by timber groynes but these provide only limited defence and are prone to damage and wear, as well as providing only 10% Annual Exceedance Probability protection against storms \(6\). These factors led to a rapid increase in erosion in the area in recent years. Bacton Gas Terminal was more than 100m from the cliff edge when it was built in the 1960s. However, some parts of the complex are now only 10m away. A solution needed to be found in order to protect the gas terminal and to prevent the 2,000 people who lived in neighbouring villages from losing their homes to erosion. However, continued coastal defence of the local community, which form\(s\) an integral element of the community and socio\-economic structure of northeast Norfolk, was only economically viable in the short term under current UK treasury rules, while hard solutions involving coastal rock armour against wave overtopping were discounted. A permanent, economically viable solution was needed and was identified in the form of sandscaping, which uses natural processes to manage defence against storms by placing sand at strategic points along the coast \(6\). 

 The Bacton Sandscaping Project, first proposed in 2016 and launched in summer 2019, has seen 1,800,000m<sup>3</sup> of sand placed along the beaches at Bacton. This forms a natural barrier and cost\-effective solution against coastal erosion and will potentially not need to be replaced for another 15 to 20 years. It will also benefit coastal communities located downdrift through maintenance of protective beaches. The £20m \(GBP20,000,000\) project was carried out by a public\-private partnership led by Team Van Oord, a multi\-partner team incorporating Dutch companies Royal Haskoning DHV, Van Oord, Kier Group and Mackley, which have a combined turnover of £5bn \(GBP5,000,000,000\). The project also involves Coastal Partnership East – a partnership between Great Yarmouth Borough Council, North Norfolk District Council, and East Suffolk Council, the Environment Agency, the Water Management Alliance, and others to manage the coast \- Norwich\-based independent oil and gas company Perenco, consulting engineers’ firm St La Haye, the Environment Agency, Shell – who operate the terminal – and North Norfolk District Council, who recruited and contracted Team Van Oord. Its work will secure long\-term environmental, economic, and cultural stability and sustainability for the local area and, due to the importance of Bacton Gas Terminal, for the UK as a whole. 

 Brooks has also been working collaboratively with the ongoing monitoring at Bacton, attending meetings with Technical Directors at Royal Haskoning and the Sandscaping Research Network. As part of this, Brooks worked with computer scientists at Birkbeck, Bournemouth and the British Geological Survey to develop low\-power wireless sensors that connect to the internet, have an embedded GPS \(for positional information\) and can be placed in rugged coastal locations to monitor continuous changes to the sediment volumes. The sensors were due to be tested in 2020 but have been delayed by the Covid\-19 crisis. It is hoped that work on testing the sensors will resume in 2021. 

 **Wider impacts on policy makers** 

 Brooks’ research findings on sediment release from retreating cliffs \(Brooks et al., 2012; Brooks and Spencer, 2012\) were included in a 2016 report \(7\) by Waveney District Council \(now East Suffolk Council\), due to concerns over Southwold beach lowering. This is important because sediments are instrumental in protecting the coast; Brooks’ research quantifies retreat but explicitly links it to sediment volumes being released from updrift cliffs that supply sediment to the beaches at Southwold. The report states “Importantly, this modelled cliff recession and sediment release shows an increasing proportion of the overall sediment being provided by the Easton Cliffs – 24% to 2050 and 33% to 2095. Sea level rise is likely to lead to increased cliff recession, but subsequently there may be more material within the system for the beaches at Southwold”. This work has led to Brooks collaborating with the Marine Knowledge Exchange Network \(MKEN\). MKEN is a diverse networking group with representatives from East Anglian Councils, Natural England, Environment Agency, Water Management Alliance, National Trust, Norfolk Wildlife Trust and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation \(CSIRO\). 

 Brooks’ collaborative work has continued with her role as a Principal Investigator on a £3.4m \(GBP3,400,000\) NERC\-funded project “BLUE coast: ‘Physical and biological dynamic coastal processes and their role in coastal recovery’”. She serves on the Executive Committee and the Scientific Advisory Board of BLUEcoast, which aims to enhance the evidence base of Shoreline Management Plans. This project is running between 2016 and 2022 \(NE/N015878/1\). Research on this project has yielded 10 Scientific papers, numerous conference presentations \(including Coastal Sediments 2019 and the Institute of Civil Engineers, 2019\), and regular knowledge exchange meetings with the British Geological Survey and the Environment Agency. Brooks was invited to advise on the project “Dynamic Dunescapes”. This project includes partners from the National Trust, Natural England, other Wildlife Trusts and Natural Resources Wales and was set up to restore sand dunes across England and Wales \(https://dynamicdunescapes.co.uk/the\-project/\). 

 Furthermore, Brooks’ collaboration with major partners is affecting national policy. In the face of the climate crisis, Brooks’ invited co\-authored review paper on coastal geomorphology \(REF7\) was used to develop the Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership \(MCCIP\)’s *2020 Report Card on Marine Climate Change Impacts* \(8\). Some of the key headlines arising from the report card include “the latest UK sea\-level rise projections imply increased coastal\-flood risk”, and “coastal assets will be subjected to enhanced rates of erosion, inundation and weathering or decay due to the effects of climate change”. The report cards provide “short, comprehensive, quality assured, high level assimilation of knowledge set out in a visually impacting way” that can be quickly used by policy makers such as ministers, Parliament and the devolved administrations. Moreover, the reports form part of the evidence base to inform the next UK Climate Change Risk Assessment \(CCRA\) and National Adaptation Plans \(8\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Underpinning Research: UoE\-led research developed “SNAP”, a shorter 12\-hour treatment regimen with the antidote acetylcysteine for paracetamol overdose, and in a randomised clinical trial found it to result in fewer adverse drug reactions \(ADRs\) and be as effective at preventing liver injury as the standard 21\-hour treatment. 

 Significance and Reach of Impact: TOXBASE, the UK’s primary authority on poisoning cases, was updated to recommend SNAP in April 2020, meaning that all hospital admissions for paracetamol overdose can now be treated according to the SNAP regimen; by December 2020, the SNAP entry on TOXBASE had been accessed 3,913 times from 185 hospitals across the UK. The SNAP regimen has been in routine use in 100% of health boards in mainland Scotland since July 2020. 

 The SNAP regimen reduces the rate of ADRs from 11% to 2%, meaning that ADRs were averted in 352 patients among the 3,913 patients for whom the TOXBASE entry was accessed. Use of SNAP is also associated with a shorter length of hospital stay, freeing NHS beds sooner and resulting in cost savings of GBP180 per patient. With SNAP now available to use for all 50,000 annual paracetamol overdose admissions, this can translate to NHS savings of up to GBP9,000,000 every year. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

##  The Challenge: Current treatment against paracetamol overdose is effective but problematic 

 Paracetamol \(acetaminophen\) overdose is one of the most common reasons for emergency hospital attendance and the leading cause of acute liver failure in the Western world. In the UK, it results in over 50,000 acute hospital admissions and is the direct cause of death of more than 200 people per year. 

 Patients admitted to hospital are treated with the antidote acetylcysteine \(NAC\). This was shown in the 1970s to be highly effective at preventing liver injury, and essentially the same 21\-hour treatment regimen has been used ever since, even though no formal dose\-ranging studies had ever been undertaken to define the optimal dosing strategy. 

 Despite its effectiveness, the 21\-hour treatment regimen is known to carry major disadvantages: first, it is associated with a high incidence of ADRs, typically nausea, vomiting and anaphylactoid reactions. Second, medication errors can occur because the regimen is complex, consisting of three different sequential weight\-related doses of NAC. Third, the length of the treatment leads to significant hospital bed occupancy \(around 47,000 bed days per year in England alone\). 

##  Shorter treatment regimen “SNAP” results in fewer ADRs 

 To address these problems with the 21\-hour regimen **,** University of Edinburgh researchers used pharmacokinetic modelling to develop a shorter 12\-hour NAC regimen, called the Scottish and Newcastle Anti\-emetic Pre\-treatment for Paracetamol Poisoning \(“SNAP”\) regimen. This was designed to deliver the same total licensed dose of NAC as the 21\-hour regimen, but without the very high early blood NAC concentrations that are associated with ADRs \[3.1\]. 

 The SNAP regime was tested in a UoE\-led double\-blind randomised controlled trial in three UK acute clinical units \(Edinburgh, Newcastle and Aberdeen\). The team randomised 222 patients to either the 21\-hour regimen or the new SNAP regimen, and recorded the number of ADRs observed. The results showed that vomiting, retching and the need for antihistamines \(to quell anaphylactoid reactions\) at 2 hours were significantly reduced in the SNAP regimen compared with the 21\-hour regimen \(in 39/108 patients in SNAP group, versus 71/109 in the 21\-hour group; p<0.0001\) \[3.2\]. 

##  SNAP regimen is safe in routine clinical use 

 Following the trial, in 2015–16 the SNAP regimen was introduced into routine clinical practice in three Toxicology Centres of Excellence in the UK \(Edinburgh, Newcastle and St Thomas’ Hospital London\). To assess the safety and efficacy of the SNAP regimen in this setting, the UoE team carried out an observational study comparing patient outcomes before and after the introduction of the SNAP regimen \(n=1,488 before and 1,852 after\). 

 This study found that the proportion of patients experiencing ADRs fell from 11% \(163 patients\) during the 21\-hour regimen to 2% \(37 patients\) after the SNAP regimen was introduced. Thus, the use of SNAP prevented 167 ADRs that would have been expected if the 21\-hour protocol had been used throughout. Importantly, there were no differences between the groups in liver function or other toxicity measures. Follow\-up data gathered from the Scottish cohort using data linkage revealed that there were no cases of liver failure or death in any patients from either group, within 30 days of discharge \[3.3\]. 

 Thus, in routine clinical use, the SNAP regimen shows equivalent efficacy in preventing liver injury to the standard 21\-hour NAC regimen, while producing fewer adverse reactions in a shorter treatment time.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Impact on clinical guidelines: SNAP was added to TOXBASE 

 The UK’s primary clinical guidelines for treating all poisoning cases are published by the National Poisons Information Service \(NPIS; the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline on poisoning redirects to the NPIS website\). NPIS maintains an online clinical toxicology database TOXBASE and its associated smartphone application, which is available to all clinicians in the UK and had 12,015 subscribers in 2018 \[5.1\]. On the 15<sup>th</sup> of April 2020, the SNAP regimen was added to TOXBASE as a protocol option for treating paracetamol overdose \[5.2\]. 

##  Impact on clinical practice 

 Following the update to TOXBASE, the SNAP regimen is now available to treat all cases of paracetamol overdose presenting at any UK hospital. Between the update on the 15<sup>th</sup> of April and the end of the REF period on the 31<sup>st</sup> of the December 2020, the SNAP dosing section of TOXBASE was accessed 3,913 times from 185 hospitals across the UK \[5.3a, b, e\]; the locations of accesses are illustrated below in **Figure 1**. In addition, within the same time period, the SNAP entry was accessed 162 times from 14 overseas countries, including the Republic of Ireland, Brazil, Australia, Poland and the Czech Republic \[5.3c–e\]. 

 It is important to note that the number of accesses to the TOXBASE site is a significant underestimation of the true number of times the regimen has been used to treat a patient. Many hospitals produce hard copies of protocols for their staff to refer to and, once healthcare professionals have become accustomed to using the regimen, they may not need to log into the database each time they use it. For example, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh has accessed the SNAP page on TOXBASE only 3 times since it became live, but has used the regimen to treat all 412 paracetamol overdoses seen in that time \[5.3e\]. 

 Figure 1.

 By summer 2020, the SNAP regimen was in routine use in 100% of hospitals in mainland Scotland, and thus is being used to treat all approximately 5,700 annual admissions for paracetamol overdose in Scotland \[5.4\]. A consultant in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board noted: “ *Since* \[summer 2020\], *it's been very successful. The juniors and nursing staff prefer using it and patients have a shorter length of stay and fewer adverse reactions*.” \[5.4c\]. 

 Notably, 11 hospitals serving major UK cities including Manchester, Bristol and Nottingham had already adopted the SNAP regimen *prior* to the TOXBASE update. First among these were the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh \(September 2015\), St Thomas’ Hospital London \(June 2016\) and Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle \(October 2016\); these 3 hospitals had by June 2018 treated a combined 2,246 patients according to the SNAP regimen \[3.3\]. They were followed by the Pennine Acute Hospital \(serving Manchester; December 2018\), North Bristol \(May 2018\), City Hospital Birmingham \(summer 2019\), Barnsley Hospital \(December 2018\), Chesterfield Royal Hospital \(August 2018\), Derby Royal \(August 2018\), Crosshouse Hospital Kilmarnock \(summer 2019\) and NHS Highland \(summer 2019\) \[5.5\]. 

##  Impact on health & welfare 

 Since the SNAP regimen reduces the rate of ADRs from 11% of patients to 2% \[3.3\] its adoption means that patients are less likely to experience highly unpleasant episodes of nausea, vomiting and anaphylactoid reactions. Thus, if the 3,913 UK accesses to the SNAP entry on TOXBASE each represented the presentation in the Emergency Department of a single patient, approximately 78 of these would have ADRs when treated with the SNAP regimen, whilst 430 patients would have experienced ADRs had they been treated with the 21\-hour regimen instead. Thus, ADRs were averted in 352 patients in this calculation alone. The true number of averted ADRs will be significantly higher, given that clinicians do not need to access TOXBASE to use the SNAP regimen every time an overdose presents, but will likely refer to a printed copy kept in the Emergency Department. 

 The averted ADRs not only reduce the distress experienced by patients but also alleviate the additional burden that ADRs place on NHS resources through requiring nursing time to care for unwell patients and administer antihistamines. 

##  Economic impact: Use of SNAP reduces length of hospital stay 

 Use of the SNAP regimen saves NHS resources through shortening the length of time patients stay in hospital. A formal health economic assessment was undertaken to quantify this reduction. The assessment used data from a clinical audit of all admissions for paracetamol overdose at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, and compared two time periods: before the SNAP regimen was introduced \(29<sup>th</sup> December 2014 to 26<sup>th</sup> September 2015, n=373\), and after SNAP was introduced \(27<sup>th</sup> September 2015 to 26<sup>th</sup> June 2016, n=450\) \[5.6\]. Pricing categories based on Health Resource Group codes were assigned to patients depending on length of stay and presence or absence of adverse events. 

 This assessment found that the 21\-hour regime was associated with more patients staying in hospital for longer than 24 hours \(the threshold typically used to denote “long stay”; **Figure 2** \[5.6\]\). Together with a lower number of adverse events recorded, the shorter length of stay associated with the SNAP regimen was found to lead to an estimated saving of GBP180.33 per patient. Extrapolating this to the approximately 50,000 patients treated annually in the UK \[5.7\], suggests that, once implemented at a national scale, use of the SNAP regimen could result in NHS savings of up to GBP9,016,000 every year \[5.6\]. 



 Figure 2: Length of hospital stay in patients treated with SNAP \(orange\) versus patients treated with the 21\-hour regime \(blue\). Approximately 2/3 of the 21\-hour regimen group exceeded the 24\-hour threshold stay typically used to denote a “long stay”, compared with only 1/5 in the SNAP group \[5.6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The work of Scottish feminist photographer Franki Raffles \(1955\-1994\) constitutes an important contribution to Scottish 20th century cultural history. Due to her early death this contribution was in danger of being forgotten. Research by Edinburgh Napier University has led to a new appreciation of Raffles and has prevented her work from remaining hidden. The creation of an archive website has brought her work to public attention, and through exhibitions and publications her place has been re\-established in the history of photography. 

 The research has: 

 **Contributed to Scottish Visual Cultural History** – conservation of Raffles’ work has ensured that a vital contribution to Scottish Visual Culture has been preserved. This is reflected by the archive’s influence on filmmakers, art galleries and creative organisations, as well as the family of Franki Raffles. 

 **Engaged New Audiences in Feminist Photography** \- over 20,500 views have been recorded by the new archive which resulted from this research. Over 5,000 people attended exhibitions of Raffles work in 2016\-17. 

 **Brought new attention to Women’s Right’s charity ‘Zero Tolerance’** \- the research has engaged with the charity, originally set up by Raffles, and has continued raising awareness of male violence against women. A new body of work has been commissioned by the charity, inspired by Raffles’ original campaign images.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Born in 1955, Franki Raffles was a leading participant in the Women’s Liberation movement. Franki moved to Edinburgh from the Isle of Lewis in 1983 and began her career as a freelance photographer with an exhibition entitled ‘Lewis Women’. Over the next two years, Raffles travelled to Zimbabwe, the Soviet Union, China, Tibet, India, Hong Kong and the Philippines, capturing images of women’s lives and work across borders.  She then returned to Edinburgh to document women participating in the 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games, and local women at work. In 1989, following her international project photographing women workers in Russia, Georgia and Ukraine, Raffles established the Scottish Zero Tolerance charity, with a public campaign of her black and white photographs and accompanying text raising awareness of male violence against women. In the early 1990s Raffles undertook a project titled ‘Lot’s Wife’, photographing Soviet Jewish immigrant women who had resettled in Israel, unfinished at the time of her untimely death in December 1994. 

 Dr Alistair Scott is an Associate Professor at Edinburgh Napier University, where he has been employed since March 2009. This research has all been led by Scott at Edinburgh Napier University and the archive is housed at the special collections archive at The University of St Andrews. Research began in 2012 when Scott became aware that Raffles’ contribution was not included in recent surveys of Scottish photography, such as Tom Normand’s 2007 book, ‘Scottish Photography: A History’, which aims to provide a complete historical narrative. Given Scott’s knowledge of Raffles’ photographic practice, the absence of her contribution from surveys such as this underlined an urgent need for a re\-evaluation of her work. 

 In 2012 Scott established contact with Raffles’ partner, Sandy Lunan. This resulted in the re\-discovery of an extensive hidden archive in danger of being abandoned. Scott conducted an audit to gain an overview of the collection, including photographs, negatives, notebooks and diaries, and gathered together Raffles’ entire photographic practice from the early 1980s until her death in 1994. After gaining consent from her Estate, Scott began the process of examining the work, establishing a timeline, identifying her commissions, projects and themes, and started to select and digitise key images. Funded by an Edinburgh Napier University small research grant, Scott led the design of a website as a way to interpret, publicise and disseminate this research and visual material **\[R1\].** 

 An important aim of the research, in addition to the preservation and exhibition of Raffles’ work, was to provide additional contextual information. To gather new primary evidence of Raffles’ working practice, in 2015 Scott filmed 10 interviews with people with in\-depth personal knowledge of the 11 bodies of work that the research had identified. The interviews included Sandy Lunan who had travelled with Raffles, and Evelyn Gillan who had worked closely on all the Edinburgh Women’s Committee projects and the establishment of ‘Zero Tolerance’. These interviews are presented in 7 short contextual films which are embedded in the website **\[R1\].** In this way the website gives a detailed introduction to Raffles photographic practice, includes biographical information, curates the work into 11 thematic areas, provides appropriate contextual interpretation, and presents edited material from the new primary research. The site also collates publications, posters, and interview transcripts. 

 The research which underpinned the creation of the website **\[R1\],** provided Scott with a complete record of Raffles’ work. Based on this Scott exhibited a retrospective selection of Raffles’ work at the first St Andrews Photography Festival in 2016 **\[R2\],** and at the Reid Gallery, Glasgow School of Art, during March and April 2017 **\[R4\].** The work was also published by the Scottish Society for the History of Photography in 2017 **\[R3\],** and was presented at an international conference focusing on women’s photography in Vilnius in 2017 **\[R5\].** A multicomponent electronic portfolio has been created to bring together and contextualise the various strands of the body of research **\[R6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research has resulted in Franki Raffles’ complete photographic practice being preserved and archived. It has also uncovered the contextual detail of the creative practices she developed and has allowed key works to be exhibited to the public. The re\-evaluation and dissemination of this body of work has: 

 **Contributed to Scottish Visual Cultural History** 

 This research has protected and publicised the work one of Scotland’s most important women photographers, and has become an important Cultural Resource. While undertaking the research, Scott searched to find a home for the archive in order that it could be safely preserved in perpetuity. Using a prototype website, Scott was able to make the case to St Andrews that they should provide this home. The website was launched to the public on International Women’s Day 8 March 2016 **\[R1\]**. It is publicly accessible and to date there have been over 20,500 views. A statement from Mark Cousins, filmmaker and writer, explains how the availability of Raffles’ work has influenced him and wider visual culture; *“It is difficult to overstate the value of Edinburgh Napier University’s Research Project, The Franki Raffles Archive.  It has recuperated, evaluated, contextualised and made available the work of a key figure in Scottish and visual culture of the 80s and 90s. The website has brought to attention the range of her photography, travel and approaches”* **\[C5\].** 

 Scott’s approach to cataloguing Raffles’ creative practice led to its preservation in the leading specialist archive at St Andrews University. The techniques used to compile it have been adopted by that institution for future interpretation work. The Photographic Archive Manager of the University Library Special Collections: noted *“These catalogue records and digital files formed the basis for all later collections work at St. Andrews \[…\] Future plans \[…\] include a selection of the Franki Raffles Collection to be displayed within the permanent exhibition of the soon\-to\-be\-reopened Museum of the University of St Andrews. This exhibit will aim to illustrate the impact of St Andrews’ graduates and the role of women through various social movements \[…\] the Franki Raffles Collection has had a significant and beneficial impact on the research and outreach activities of the Special Collections at St Andrews”* **\[C9\]** . 

 This research also led to the recognition of Raffles’ legacy and acknowledgement of her significance in the wider context of the history of women’s photography. Scott organised a public symposium entitled ‘Assessing the Legacy of Franki Raffles’ on 25 April 2017 at The Centre for Contemporary Arts \(CCA\) Glasgow, where Raffles work was discussed with leading experts and attended by 43 members of the public **\[R4\]**. Subsequently Scott and Brownrigg were invited to present a paper on Raffles at the International Conference, ‘Fast Forward Women in Photography’, National Museum of Art, Vilnius, Lithuania, 4 November 2017 **\[R5\]**. A professor from the University of Creative Arts, who attended both events stated “ *the paper given on Franki Raffles unravelled even more of this distinct and significant history \[…\] This innovative research has focused attention on the legacy and significance of Franki’s contribution to feminist photographic practice that might otherwise have been lost and opened up new ways to consider women’s photography in Scotland in the 1980’s and 1990’s.”* **\[C8\]**. 

 The benefit of the research to the Raffles family underscores the impact on the creative history of Scotland. Sandy Lunan, Raffles’ partner, states *“The impact of this for me and the family is very significant. We know now that Franki will not be forgotten and know her work can be seen and re\-assessed”* **\[C1\]**. Hugh Raffles, Franki’s brother, Professor of Anthropology at The New School, New York, USA, states *“The \[…\] Archive \[…\] doesn’t simply memorialise my sister; it makes her work available to a new generation of scholars, students, and activists,…….she challenges us to view the world as she sees it, and she proposes collaborative methodologies that remain radical today.* **\[C2\]** *”* 

 **Engaged New Audiences with Feminist Photography** 

 To date, the archive has had over 20,500 views **\[R1\]**. Users of the website have commented on the experience of engaging with Raffles’ work, and how beneficial it has been to their understanding of Scottish Feminist Photography. One individual stated “ *What a journey – amazing work”’*. Another stated *“Great work, and really important to showcase this pioneer*”. 

 Scott has also given public talks since the website launch, for example at Stills Gallery, Edinburgh in September 2016, attended by 50 people. This was followed by a seminar at the University of Stirling in October 2016, disseminating awareness of the research to scholars engaged in women’s studies. There was a further public talk at Glasgow Women’s Library in February 2017 attended by over 70 members of the public which led to an interview for the on\-line photography magazine Wildfires. Scott’s research was also covered by the popular press in a 2 page article in the Daily Record **\[C13\].** 

 Following the website launch Scott curated an exhibition of 17 Raffles’ photographs at the 1<sup>st</sup> St Andrews Photography Festival, 1 August \-11 September 2016 **\[R2\]**, celebrating *“the vitality and resilience of women in their varied personal and working roles”* \(Festival Brochure\). This was the first exhibition of Raffles’ work since her death in 1994. Two images were also selected for the main festival exhibition celebrating ‘175 years of Scottish Photography’ subsequently on tour at other venues, including An Lanntair, Stornoway \(2017\). 

 Subsequently Scott established a partnership with Jenny Brownrigg, Exhibitions Director, Glasgow School of Art. They worked on a retrospective exploring three bodies of Raffles’ work: the 1987 project ‘To let you understand *…; ‘*Soviet Women Workers’ in 1989; and ‘Zero Tolerance’ *.* This was supported by a publication to provide contextual information about Raffles creative practice, and the exhibition *‘*Observing Women Working – Franki Raffles’, Reid Gallery, Glasgow which ran 4 March – 27 April 2017, with a total of 4,351 visitors. The many comments in the Visitors’ Book included “ *Loved this exhibition, helping to fight the age old myth that women are weak”, “More important today than ever – inspiring, bold, uncompromising”,* **\[C12\]**. The publication print\-run of 330 sold out to visitors.  There was also excellent press coverage reaching a wide audience both in popular and specialist publications **\[C12\].** 

 Dr Catherine Spencer, Convenor of the Tate Contemporary Art Network, attended the Reid Gallery exhibition, and stated: *“Scott's research into the Franki Raffles archive has been absolutely crucial in enabling material that would otherwise have remained unknown, and thereby absent from histories of feminist practice in the UK during the 1970s and 1980s, to become accessible \[…\] In conjunction with the website the exhibition \[…\] has significantly helped to raise wider visibility and understanding of Raffles’ work in Scotland and beyond.* More recently Raffles’ work has been presented at the Glasgow Women’s Library On\-Line open talks ‘Ways of Seeing: Women in Photography’ in Scotland October\-November 2019, and at the 2019 Photo Oxford Festival. 

 **Brought new attention to Women’s Right’s charity **Zero Tolerance 

 The charity ‘Zero Tolerance’ is an organisation set up to raise awareness of male violence against women, created with involvement from Raffles herself. The aforementioned exhibitions were publicised by ‘Zero Tolerance’ and the organisation hosts a link to the archive on their website. Rachel Adamson, Co\-Director of the charity, confirmed that the research project had played: *“an important role in ensuring the legacy of a key feminist campaigner is remembered \[…\] By shedding light on Franki’s work on the initial Zero Tolerance campaign the archive has also had an impact in highlighting women’s inequality and the need to tackle violence against women These are key Scottish Government policy imperatives, as well as central to the work of Zero Tolerance today.”* **\[C3\]**. 

 In 2017 the Raffles archive led to a commission by *Zero Tolerance* of a new body of work by photographer Alicia Bruce, exhibited at Stills Gallery, Edinburgh **\[C14\]**. Alicia utilised the archive to create a new, modern body of feminist photography, in the style of Raffles original ‘Zero Tolerance’ work. Bruce states “ *I made this series of photographs in collaboration with women from all walks of life based in Scotland \[...\] The images I made are in the spirit of Franki Raffles photographs from the original campaign \[…\] In the Franki Raffles archive website, the most important aspects for me were the video interviews… The archive also gave me easy access to the original campaign posters”* **\[C7\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research carried out at Anglia Ruskin University \(ARU\) into the social, linguistic and academic integration of pupils with English as an additional language \(EAL\) has led to demonstrable impact on educational strategies and outcomes. Pupils have been integrated more successfully into the classroom, and both pupils and parents into the wider school community. EAL teaching practice and teacher training have changed. More than 96,000 pupils, 144,000 parents and 20,000 teachers have benefited from the research, either directly or as national and international “downstream” beneficiaries. A total of 24 NGOs in the UK and two other countries also benefited, including the original grant\-giver, the Bell Foundation. The Welsh government used the findings as statutory guidance for its national curriculum, and five English local councils adopted the EAL Assessment Framework based on the research. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There are more than 1.5 million pupils in UK schools who speak English as an additional language \(EAL\), meaning that they have grown up speaking another language at home. More than 20% of primary school pupils and nearly 17% of secondary school pupils are classified as EAL, and it is likely that numbers will increase in future due to migration needs in the UK employment market. EAL pupils follow the national curriculum. Those who are not proficient in English must develop their English skills at the same time, which puts them at an educational disadvantage. Support strategies for such pupils and their parents are therefore vital to avoid an attainment gap between EAL and non\-EAL pupils. ARU research has aimed to develop such strategies through an interdisciplinary mixed\-methods and multi\-site research design. 

 This case study builds on Dr Claudia Schneider’s research on the integration of migrant communities since 2004. The case study comprises two linked projects on the social, linguistic and academic integration of EAL pupils \(2013–14 and 2014–16\) which she co\-led in collaboration with Cambridge University \(CU\) \(equal partners; 50/50 share of funding; overall funding for two projects £90,000\). As co\-lead, Schneider was responsible for all areas of the EAL research process, including data collection, analysis and the co\-production of research reports. Schneider led on social integration, academic achievement, school–home communication and parental engagement, while CU staff led on assessment, language development and classroom pedagogy. The two EAL projects were innovative in that they adopted an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to researching the social, language and academic integration of EAL pupils and their parents. The projects were funded by the Bell Foundation, which aims to improve practice and policy for disadvantaged communities. 

 The mixed methods projects involved a regional survey of 48 secondary schools in the East of England \(out of 145 schools contacted\) and in\-depth case studies of four schools \(primary and secondary\); including 136 interviews with teachers \(including senior management teams and EAL staff\), EAL pupils, parents of EAL pupils and EAL experts in the community, as well as a survey of 407 EAL and non\-EAL pupils, a survey of 64 EAL parents, and a writing task for EAL pupils. Interviews with pupils and teachers and the writing task had a longitudinal aspect \(repeated twice\). Qualitative and quantitative data were subjected to a thematic analysis \(using NVivo data analysis software\) and descriptive and inferential statistics \(using SPSS statistical software\) respectively. 

 The research found major obstacles to the social, language and academic integration of EAL pupils: a lack of a holistic and co\-ordinated approach to EAL in schools \[1\-4\]; limited social integration of pupils \(e.g. low levels of friendship groups between EAL and non\-EAL pupils\); teachers lacking information about migratory experiences and countries of origin; ineffective communication about EAL among teachers and with EAL pupils and their parents, leading to low levels of understanding and empathy about EAL on the part of teachers; deficiencies in school–home communication \[1\-4\], e.g. one\-way communication, leading to EAL parents being left with a limited knowledge of the English school system and their children’s learning \[1,2\]; and discrepancies between parents’ and teachers’ views of parental knowledge regarding their children’s schooling, engagement and barriers to engagement \[1,2\]. The findings also identified limited use of effective EAL teaching practices \[1\-4\], a focus on basic English for everyday communication rather than enhanced English for analysis in English language teaching \[3,4\] and ineffective initial EAL assessment practices \[3,4\]. On the basis of these findings, the researchers developed EAL strategies for pupils and families with diverse migration backgrounds.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The main beneficiaries of this research have been EAL pupils and their parents, teachers, five local authorities in England, the Welsh Government, the Bell Foundation and another 26 national and international organisations working in the educational field. 

 **Impact on education through the Bell Foundation:** Between 2016 and 2019, the research had direct impact on the educational activities of its main funder, the Bell Foundation \(BF\), who incorporated our findings on EAL pupils’ social integration, EAL communication within the school, school–home communication with parents of EAL pupils, parental engagement, and EAL language development and assessment into their Language for Results Programme \(LRP\). BF rolled out LRP in 36 **national training sessions** \(2016–17\) across the UK and 12 **British Council** seminars in the UK \(on EAL strategies\) for 481 British school teachers \(primary and secondary\). Both schemes had significant impact by increasing teachers’ understanding of EAL and their application of EAL strategies in the classroom and wider school context \[1b\]. 

 BF also incorporated our research findings on assessment, social integration and school–home communication into their development of a new EAL Nexus website \[1c\]. The site had over 596,000 users \(2018\-2020\), with 56% from the UK and 44% from outside the UK including the **US** \(9.9%\), **India** \(5.7%\), and **Australia** \(3.5%\) \[1b\]. Users of the website stated: *“There are some great resources on Nexus \[…\] supporting EAL learners to participate fully in their education”* \(teacher, Twitter, 2018\); *“You are now a 'go to' site for me\!”* \(teacher, 2019\) \[1b\]. 

 BF further developed new assessment strategies on the basis of our research, resulting in an EAL Assessment Framework which changed schools’ EAL assessment strategies. Between 2017 and 2020 the Framework, support strategies and the new digital tracker had been downloaded 42,411 times \[1b\]. The framework won the **British Council’s ELTons Award** **for Local Innovation** in 2018. Since 2019 it has been adopted by **five local authorities \(Leeds, Cambridgeshire, Luton, Hampshire and Essex\)** and became part of statutory guidance in the **Welsh national curriculum**, changing EAL strategies in Welsh schools \[1a\]. BF also built on the research findings in lobbying the UK government in 2016 to introduce an EAL postgraduate degree and quoted the research in materials prepared for the **Department for Education’s Early Career Framework**. Highlighting the significance of the research to their work, the BF’s Director stated in February 2020: *“The research… helped frame a holistic approach to the child’s attainment looking at both language and development, academic achievement and social integration. The ‘Language for Results’ intervention… is now being scaled to schools across England”* \[1a\]. 

 **Impact on schools and teachers**: The projects had direct impact \(2014–2019\) on EAL practice at 68 schools and on 560 teachers who participated in our two research projects or the Bell Foundation training programmes described above, plus 150 teachers and trainees who have attended EAL training each year since 2017 in one of the case study schools \[1b, 9, EAL reports 1/2\]. Teacher impact is related, for example, to the use of new and effective EAL teaching strategies and two\-way communication strategies with pupils and parents, which fostered mutual understanding, increased empathy and the confidence of teachers: *“\[I gained\] understanding how EAL pupils feel in the classroom environment and the importance of techniques to support them, e.g. modelling”; “\[The training\] made me consider strategies to help make classes more inclusive for EAL students”* \(teachers\); *“The SLT \[senior leadership team\] now receive far fewer panicked requests from teachers about EAL”* \(Assistant Principal\); *“The training \[…\] has already raised the profile \[of EAL\] and is having an impact on practice”* \(Senior Vice Principal\). Impact also related to initial teacher training \(ITT\): *“The Bell Foundation programme \[…\] improved the overall quality of our training provision \[…\] in the latest observation, the EAL training session was judged to be outstanding”* \(ITT Training Manager\) \[1b\]. The project had a “downstream” impact \(2016–19\) on 20,000 teachers via the EAL research projects, workshops organised by ARU, CU and schools, the British Council seminars and the Bell Foundation’s training programmes \(excluding teachers’ use of the Nexus website; see above\) \[1b, 1d, 3, 8–10; EAL reports 1/2\], and via EAL staff who had participated in the above events, cascading their knowledge to fellow teachers. 

 **EAL pupils**: The projects impacted \(2016–20\) directly on the social integration, language development and achievement of 1,250 EAL pupils who attended the case study schools and 10,230 EAL pupils via the BF’s EAL programme \[1c\]. Pupil impact related, for example, to higher levels of confidence, a sense of being part of the class and school community, improvement of academic English, uptake of GCSE subjects such as English, and higher GCSE grades: *“When I first came and got support in class, I felt more safe and comfortable; my projected grades for English language and literature were 2/3. Six months later, I got 4/5 in the real exams”* \(EAL pupil\); *“The strategies have had a positive impact on the achievement of EAL pupils”* \(EAL staff\). Downstream impact extended to 96,000 EAL pupils via the teachers who attended the Bell Foundation training programmes, EAL projects, and national and international workshops and projects \[1b, 3, 4, 7–10; EAL reports 1/2\]. 

| **Parents of EAL pupils**: The project had a direct impact on 165 parents \(East of England\) who participated in the research projects and English classes at one of the case study schools \(30 parents per year since 2016\). Parental impact was reflected in increased parental knowledge about their children’s learning as well as parents’ English language development, confidence, engagement and employment: *“I feel more confident when talking with other people, I can easily fill out an application and write email, I can support my children in learning process”; “Now I am more confident in speaking with another people…I applied for Senior Operator job and I passed all test. So now I have a better job”; “Helped me to discuss with teachers at school about my kids without my husband’s support”; “Definitely an increase in EAL parents attending”* \(EAL staff\). The British Council and Bell Foundation training programmes, the research projects and national and international workshops and projects had a downstream impact on 144,000 parents \[1b, 3, 4, 7–10\].  **NGOs**: The findings impacted on 22 national and 2 international NGOs including bilingual advice services, community minority group services, and political think tanks. Several used our research in their own reports on aspects of EAL, including the **National Association for Language Development in the Curriculum \(Naldic**, the UK’s National subject association for EAL\) \[2\]; the **National Literacy Trust** \[4\] **;** and **Renaisi**, a social enterprise that helps disadvantaged people and places thrive. Renaisi’s Head of Schools & Communities wrote: *“I have taken some really good, practical ideas for our service”* \[7\]. The recommendations based on our research enhanced these NGOs’ training programmes for teachers and/or parents and enabled the implementation of new EAL teaching practices, parent engagement strategies and school–home communication. The recommendations also impacted on advice given by the **National Institute of Economic and Social Research** \(report on *How Schools are Integrating New Migrant Pupils and their Families*; 2019\) and the **Institute for Public Policy Research** \(report on Britain’s supplementary schools: *Saturdays for Success,* 2015\) \[5, 6\].  **Local integration projects:** The research findings regarding integration and communication were the basis for two further integration projects in the community, led by Claudia Schneider. The project “Arriving at a new place” increased understanding between residents with diverse backgrounds \(including EAL and non\-EAL students of a secondary school\) in Cambridge and was presented at the Being Human Festival 2019 \(800 visitors\). In March 2020, it was rolled out online \(due to Covid\-19\) and was taken up by five organisations nationally and internationally \[10\]. The findings from the EAL projects relating to integration and communication impacted on an integration project in Harlow \(commissioned by Harlow Local Council via Rainbow Services; February–July 2020\) and two integration workshops for 11 local governmental and non\-governmental organisations. Harlow Council’s social integration strategy has changed significantly in line with the project’s recommendations on reciprocal integration strategies \[3\].  **International impact:** At an Erasmus Plus workshop in Cambridge \(2018\), the research findings were shared with international representatives of six organisations working with young people with diverse backgrounds in **France**, **Italy**, **Poland**, **Romania**, **Slovakia** and **Spain**. An online group was developed, which exchanges information on the social integration of migrant pupils. One of the participants \(Maison de l’Europe des Yvelines\) went on to use the findings to lobby their regional government in France to enhance migrant pupils’ social integration \(since 2019\) \[10\]. The findings of the EAL projects and the impact project *Arriving at a New Place* were also used by organisations in **Germany**, **Norway, Romania and Slovenia.** The Center for Diversity, Democracy and Integration in Education \(University of Hildesheim, Germany\) has incorporated the research findings and the *Arriving* project into their teacher network \(488 teachers/staff\) and a community integration project with “super impact organisations” in Germany. The Norwegian University of Science and Technology has used the findings for a school integration project \(2018–21\). The youth organisation IPTA \(Projects and Ideas for Active Youth\) in Romania has used the recommendations of the EAL projects and the *Arriving* project for a pilot curriculum for refugees living at the Emergency Transit Center in Romania \(UNHCR\). The Slovenian Migration Institute \(Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts\) has applied the findings and the *Arriving* project to a project on diversity teacher training \(workshops with six schools in 2020; indirect impact: 10,000 teachers who are connected to the project nationally\). To enhance the ongoing impact, Claudia Schneider has established an international network on Social Integration, Migration and Local Communities with eight national and international partners to exchange best practice regarding integration in schools and the wider community \[10\]. |

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 By diversifying, decentring, and globalising narratives about suffrage, Dr Mukherjee’s research on ‘Indian Suffragettes’ has achieved profound cultural, educational and political impacts. It has challenged preconceptions, leading to the inclusion of black, Asian and minority ethnic \(BAME\) communities in both histories of national commemoration, such as the inclusion of Indian women into plinths at Parliament Square, and public discourse. It has instigated new learning, thinking and action about race, empire and global approaches to suffrage histories, in cultural institutions campaign groups and the media, inspiring policymakers, parliamentarians and activists, as well as members of the public, especially BAME groups. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to Dr Mukherjee’s research into Indian suffrage campaigners in the first half of the twentieth century, there was little public understanding of Indian suffragettes’ involvement in the British suffragette movement, nor of their mobility and participation in transnational discourses. Mukherjee joined the University of Bristol in September 2016 as Lecturer in the History of Migration, having been awarded an AHRC Early Career Fellowship a year earlier. Her AHRC proposal received the highest possible rating \(6\) by the Peer Review College, marking it as ‘an outstanding proposal that is world\-leading in all of the following: scholarship, originality, quality, and significance’. 

 Research during this grant, and following, led to Mukherjee’s monograph *Indian Suffragettes: Female Identities and Transnational Networks* **\[3.1\]**, which used a combination of historical and geographical methodologies and archives in Australia, India, Switzerland, the US, the UK and Ireland. *Indian Suffragettes* emphasises the vibrancy of the Indian suffrage movement in the early twentieth century. Mukherjee’s research shows that Indian 'suffragettes' were not only actively involved in campaigns within the Indian subcontinent; they also travelled to Britain, the US, Europe, and elsewhere, taking part in transnational discourses on feminism, democracy, and suffrage. Significantly, the monograph highlights the ways in which Indian women travelled globally at a time when they were colonial subjects. It also reveals the ways in which Indian women were involved in the British suffrage movement before 1918. Further work **\[3.2\]** has demonstrated the enduring impact of the internationalist suffrage movement in the inter\-war period, and how it fed into the pan\-Asian feminist movement. 

 This research has made two major contributions to public understandings of suffrage history. First, it emphasises the global connections of the suffrage movement, especially the connections between the British and Indian suffrage movements, showing that the campaigns for British female suffrage were not unique nor alone. Second, it brings to light the experiences of women from BAME backgrounds and their relationship with the British suffrage movement, highlighting that, although a small number of Indian women were involved, many women of colour were excluded from the British suffrage movement. In doing so, it draws attention to the ways in which race and empire were fundamental issues that British suffrage campaigners were engaging with, while also showing the ways in which the movement was more diverse than previously imagined.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Mukherjee’s research and publications on Indian Suffragettes **\[3.1, 3.2\]** have radically reframed understanding of the history of female suffrage in the UK, shattering received ideas to allow the inclusion of BAME women in national histories and public commemorations. In particular, her research had a profound political, cultural and educational impact on the national commemoration in 2018 of the centenary of the Representation of the People Act. Suffrage histories, with their focus on key individuals such as Millicent Fawcett and the Pankhursts, have tended to centre on traditional narratives of women’s progress through a white Anglo\-centric lens. Collaborating with Mukherjee, and drawing on her research, allowed the media, museums and charities to diversify the stories they told to include Black and Asian history and to connect the British suffrage movement with global histories. Crucially for all these organisations, this allowed them to present suffrage histories in a way that was relevant to BAME communities, attracted new audiences, and connected the centenary to current social and political issues. BAME audience members and readers saw their history reflected in a national commemorative moment, were invited into and included in new spaces, and were engaged and inspired to carry out their own research. The centenary has also left a lasting legacy in the form of a material memorial which – thanks to Mukherjee’s research and advocacy – includes BAME women in the suffrage movement. The impact of Mukherjee’s research continues to resonate in policy outcomes, ongoing work with the Fawcett Society, and a major exhibition at the British Library. 

###  Inclusion of BAME women on a major new national monument 

 Mukherjee’s impact on the centenary and its commemoration of the suffrage movement began in 2016. She advised the committee that campaigned for a public statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, that was unveiled by the Prime Minster and Mayor of London in April 2018. Mukherjee’s input led to the images and names of two women of Indian origin \(Sophia Duleep Singh; Lolita Roy\) on the plinth, the only two non\-white figures **\[5.8\]**. Professor Gottlieb, the lead historical consultant working with artist Gillian Wearing on deciding on the 59 figures to be included on the plinth, has stated “I approached Dr Mukherjee to put forward the names of at least two Indian women who deserved to be represented around the plinth. It was vital for the artist to represent the widest possible range of figures who contributed to the suffrage movement, across ethnic, religious, class, regional and gender lines. Dr Mukherjee's ground\-breaking research and paradigm\-shifting re\-conceptualisation of Indian women and the suffrage is now represented on a national monument in Britain's premier civic space"" **\[5.8\]**. 

###  New, engaged audiences for suffrage histories 

 During the course of the centenary year in 2018, Mukherjee was invited to speak at 10 public events in Bristol, Manchester and London, offering talks and engaging in panel discussions on suffrage histories and its relationship to contemporary history teaching and feminist activities. She highlighted the role of BAME women in the suffrage movement in Britain and elsewhere, adding new historical insight into existing historical conversations. These events markedly increased public awareness of the need to diversify suffrage and women’s histories. One attendee commented that “I found Dr Sumita Mukherjee’s talk on Indian suffragettes particularly interesting and thought provoking…these talks left me wanting to know more about each subject” **\[5.10\]**. Audience figures at each event ranged from 40\-150 and reached beyond traditional audiences for historical events: six events were specifically designed for BAME audiences. This included two public events for BAME communities in parliament, with an audience of c. 35 at each, and two fully booked events in Tower Hamlets \(capacity 60\). A public event at the LSE in May 2018 was recorded as the second most diverse audience they had that year **\[5.1\]**. 

 Mukherjee’s public events have encouraged BAME audiences to pursue further research and activities relating to Indian suffrage. An attendee at Tower Hamlets in September 2018 noted: “A fascinating and informative talk, will research more on this subject”; another remarked: “great evening learning about Indian suffragettes in the context of British society as well as global suffrage movement\! So many things to research and think about\!” **\[5.5\]**. The chair of the event, Julie Begum, Chair of the Swadhinata Trust, following Mukherjee’s talk subsequently gave talks herself on ‘Indian Suffragettes’ in the East End of London in 2019, demonstrating the inspiration and learning she had taken from Mukherjee’s research **\[5.6\]**. 

 Mukherjee’s research has particularly motivated young women from BAME backgrounds. A young woman of Parsee faith, Shazneen Munshi, was encouraged to write an article about the Zoroastrian All\-Party Parliamentary Group event in September 2018, which was published in the Mumbai newspaper, *Jama Jamshed Weekly*, and *Asian Voice* in November 2018, the leading British magazine for Asian communities. Munshi described how inspiring the event was especially as a young Zoroastrian in the ‘captivating surroundings’ of parliament **\[5.7\]**. 

###  Inclusion of Black and Asian histories in the media coverage of the centenary 

 This impact on the diversity of public interest is demonstrated by the take\-up of Mukherjee’s research on Black and Asian suffrage histories across a wide range of both mainstream and more specialised media outlets. In February 2018, Mukherjee was interviewed by the *BBC*, *Time*, *Al Jazeera*, *Broadly*, and *Refinery29*. Mukherjee’s work has been cited in other media outlets and social media as a result, such as on the Google Arts and Culture site. She was interviewed by two feminist podcasts \(Kicking the Kyriarchy and Vulva la Revolution\), after the producers had seen Mukherjee speak at public events and realised that these stories of Indian suffragettes were not being told elsewhere and, as one producer put it, “how skewed the British image of suffrage history is”. She was also interviewed on the major American podcast ‘Citations Needed’ and the French Radio station RTE, revealing international interest in these histories **\[5.2\]**. Evidence of this ongoing interest is that Mukherjee’s blog post on Indian suffrage for the parliamentary Vote 100 blog site was \(as of Spring 2018\) their most popular post in terms of numbers **\[5.3\]**. 

###  Contributing to the Fawcett Society’s centenary strategy and progress towards their strategic goals 

 Mukherjee has collaborated extensively with the Fawcett Society, the UK’s leading charity campaigning for gender equality and women’s rights. The 2018 centenary was a major event for the Society, who wished to honour Millicent Fawcett, on whose legacy the organisation is built, while also reaching out to new BAME audiences and young people. The CEO of the Society explained that Mukherjee’s advisory work was central to developing their strategy for the centenary: “Dr Mukherjee's work with the Fawcett Society has been vital especially during 2018 in opening up our activities to a wider, more ethnically diverse audience. As a Society, a priority for us is to develop programmes of events and campaigns that engage with BAME audiences. Dr Mukherjee's work and our conversations have been influential in this regard” **\[5.10\]**. 

 Mukherjee has advised the Society, written blog posts, been invited to speak at various Fawcett events, and featured in their newsletters. In 2017, she helped the Society produce educational packs on suffrage histories, highlighting the role of BAME women in the movement, and helping the Society in their strategic mission to reach young people. Mukherjee’s collaboration informed the Society’s major national social media campaign in 2018, which acknowledged the ways in which suffrage celebrations needed to be more inclusive not only of British BAME women but also of women around the world. The CEO explained the impact of Mukherjee’s contribution: Mukherjee’s blog post ‘has had 5453 readers and was the 5th most popular page on the Fawcett Society website over 2018 \(placing it above our major campaign page on Equal Pay Day\). 84% of the readers of this blog post were visiting the Fawcett website for the first time, so it served a really crucial role in introducing a new audience to us’ **\[5.10\]**. She continues: “Dr Mukherjee's research and consultancy for the Fawcett Society has been instrumental in our strategic mission to reach out to more young people and BAME audiences. Her work has made us more conscious of the racial diversity within the suffrage movement, the ways in which a forward\-looking campaigning charity can use history to inspire young people of all backgrounds, especially by looking beyond Britain and working with women around the world”. Mukherjee continues to advise the Society on issues of British BAME histories and inclusion **\[5.10\]**. 

###  Influencing changes in policy and practice at the Government Equalities Office 

 In February 2018, Mukherjee organised a workshop, with History & Policy, in parliament for policy makers, parliamentarians, academics and activists \(c.35 attendees\) to consider ways of using suffrage histories from the Global South to inform policymaking on inclusion and representation. In responses to a questionnaire, attendees agreed that they had been encouraged to think about the policy implications of the suffrage movement and methods for campaigning for greater racial and gender diversity in the UK parliament **\[5.9\]**. Attendees indicated that they would plan follow\-up activities, implement conversations into policy in their own organisations, and would take more account of race in future events. One attendee described the event as 'inspiring', that it helped to ""challenge \[their\] preconceptions” and “valued the very helpful concrete questions linking past content to present controversies"" **\[5.9\]**. 

 Mukherjee’s parliamentary workshop directly influenced policy making and programmes led by the Government Equalities Office \(GEO\). One attendee, the Head of Listening Platform Team at GEO, has applied the knowledge she gained to her work with women who face multiple barriers to achieving their potential. She said: “Following the suffrage centenary I went on to oversee a project which gave a grant to Bristol Women's Voice called 'The City Listening Project' and two other cities, which held forums for women from diverse backgrounds to speak about what they feel are barriers preventing them from reaching their potential. It was the contribution of event's like Sumita's that helped to develop my thinking about how we listen to voices that so often get sidelined” **\[5.11\]**. 

###  A more diverse history of the fight for women’s rights at the British Library 

 The strength and significance of these impacts, as well as her expertise and profile, meant that Mukherjee was invited onto the advisory board for the major British Library exhibition ‘Unfinished Business: The Fight for Women’s Rights’ which was due to open in April 2020 with an estimated 80,000 visitors to the exhibition generating over GBP1 million in ticket sales \(GBP15 per ticket\). However, the launch was postponed until October 2020 due to Covid\-19, and with social distancing rules in place the visitor targets have been reduced to 7,000. Initially due to run until February 2021, the exhibition has been extended until August 2021 \(Covid\-permitting\). In addition, the exhibition will be supported by a series of 50 events, touring exhibitions to 10 libraries across the UK, and by web resources \(live since October 2020\) aimed at secondary and university learning audiences. With Mukherjee’s intervention, this exhibition focusing on women’s rights in Britain includes a whole section relating to Indian suffragettes, and she has written a chapter for the accompanying exhibition book. 

 The lead curator at the British Library, explains: “As a result of Dr Mukherjee's advice and subject knowledge we have included a thematic strand of objects and stories which would otherwise have been omitted. In particular, Dr Mukherjee has pointed us towards and helped illuminate content about Indian women's activism and the complicated relationship between Indian women activists and white British women activists in the early part of the twentieth century. Dr Mukherjee's advice has contributed significantly to my being able to bring to light diverse histories which lie outside mainstream historical accounts. This is especially important because the exhibition is aiming to attract a large percentage of visitors from the 15\-25 year old age bracket from diverse backgrounds  ̶  these audiences do not traditionally attend British Library exhibitions” **\[5.4\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Rautomead develop, design and provide unique continuous casting equipment for the non\-ferrous and precious metals industries globally. A partnership with the University of Dundee has led to the development of new alloys with reduced costs, simplification of manufacturing processes and shorter lead\-times. This allowed Rautomead’s customers to enter or develop new markets across the world. The partnership has also enabled Rautomead to substantially improve quality, resulting in reduced risk of consumer returns and the protection of the Rautomead brand. These research\-based outcomes represent a multimillion\-pound saving for the company. 

  
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Prior to its involvement with the University of Dundee \(UoD\), Rautomead product and process development was largely empirically based, utilising its in\-house facilities and the expertise and experience of its staff.  Since October 2011, the company has worked extensively with UoD in its research and development \(R&D\) efforts, with activities including materials characterisation and development work. Research into materials characterisation is of paramount importance to Rautomead since this is the process by which the physical, chemical and/or structural properties of alloys are determined. This work was enabled through an Innovate UK award led by Professor Amin Abdolvand \(Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) Grant number: 8747\), a KTP Associate \(2012\-2014\), and two subsequent Technology Support Agreements \(2014\-2017 and 2017\-2020\). 

 The KTP project was key in crystallising the R&D activities between the two organisations with set objectives and commercial goals. The aim was to process new complex high\-performance alloys by improving the capability and performance of continuous casting machinery \(Figure 1\).  This initiative with a modest budget \(£95k – 50% Innovate UK and 50% Scottish Funding Council\) led to a substantial multimillion end value achieved as noted in section 4 and also outlined in the attached Letter of Support from the company **\[E1\]**. 

 The key underpinning research activities were experimental in nature: 

-  The addition of lead \(Pb\) to brass \(alloy of copper and zinc\) increased its machinability and corrosion resistance, enabling its applications in marine environments \(to prevent biofouling\) and as electrical cabling within wind turbines for renewable energy applications. The research performed within **\[R1\]** demonstrated the unique horizontal\-setup processing conditions which enabled the casting of high\-volume, high\-quality \(characterised by a high homogeneity\), Pb\-brass alloy at Rautomead, leading on to the development and commercialisation of Pb\-brass casting equipment. 

-  Improvement to the copper \(Cu\) alloy casting quality was demonstrated within **\[R2\]**, indicated by increases to material elongation and a smaller metal grain structure. This was obtained from an investigation into the processing parameters such as the cooling fluid flow \(influencing metal cooling\) and the casting withdraw rate \(which influences the product yield\). The research enabled improvements in the efficiency of casting equipment used in the fabrication of copper\-tin\-phosphorus \(Cu\-Sn\-P\) that is applied for corrosion resistance marine applications; oxygen\-free\-Cu which is used for electrical high data rate transmission cabling; and copper\-zinc \(Cu\-Zn\) used in electronics applications. Collectively the research contributed to the commercialisation of the casting equipment for these alloys by Rautomead. 

-  Further investigations into casting speed were made to identify casting improvements for the alloys of copper and magnesium \(Cu\-Mg\) applied in high\-speed rail trolley cabling and aluminium\-brass \(Al\-brass\) which is used in subsea and propeller construction **\[R3\]**. Alterations to the casting withdrawal pulse setting were applied \(for control of material quality\), in order to identify improved material performance and casting conditions. The research enabled Rautomead to reduce manufacturing turnaround for the alloys leading to the commercialisation of new casting equipment. 

 In summary, the underpinning research on the development of high value alloys established and consolidated strong links with Rautomead. The research enabled the transfer of new concepts and technology from laboratory into the manufacturing process. Material characterisation is now part of the company’s “customer experience”, particularly where new alloys are casted. This has assisted Rautomead in maintaining their international visibility \[e.g. **R4\-R6**\] and market leading position for non\-ferrous alloys.

 Rautomead is an established supplier of unique equipment in the continuous casting, wire, and cable industry, with a global reputation for developing and providing equipment to produce high\-quality materials. Target customers for the products developed under the aegis of this impact case study included a number of leading Japanese, European and Chinese wire and cable providers. The companies will pay and engage to enhance their market position and/or develop new markets. In particular, Rautomead’s ability to manufacture products to satisfy the demand generated by developments in the electric vehicle industry made it an attractive proposition for customers. 

 The work with UoD allowed Rautomead to reliably and efficiently verify the uniqueness and quality of new machines, technology and processes for its customers across the world. 

 Since working with UoD, access to research skills has opened new market opportunities \- particularly in Japan, where technical expertise and detail are especially valued; it has also enabled Rautomead to provide a known, evidenced and proven solution allowing them to increase the margins for their global equipment sales **\[E1\]**. 

 This has been especially valuable in commercial negotiations, where the balance of technical risk, and hence leverage for customer discount has moved significantly towards Rautomead’s favour. In one case this led to an improved gross margin capability in the region of £200k over their previous similar projects. Considering that Rautomead sell between 5\-10 machines per year, Rautomead estimate that this R&D partnership is impacting their bottom line somewhere between £1\-2M per year **\[E1\]**. 

###  Improved production lead times 

 Equipment sales are often underpinned by Rautomead performing *‘casting\-trials’*, where a quantity of material is cast, usually for the first time, as a means of proving both product and process capability. The research has enabled Rautomead to provide their customers with material characterisation information from casting trials, something they were not able to do previously, but which is of significant value to the customer and which feeds into subsequent process optimisation and equipment design modification **\[E1\]**. 

 As a direct result of this work, the production lead time has been reduced by 25%, leading to time and material resource savings valued at £180,000 \(as in the example of Cu\-Zn alloy used in robot welding\). According to Rautomead, the company’s culture has altered in respect of the evaluation of untested alloys, leading to “ *a considerable reduction in numbers of costly trials performed”* **\[E1\]** *.* 

 Another specific scientific example of the impact pursued through this approach is the recent identification of adverse chemical reactions of a nickel\-chromium \(Ni\-Cr\) alloy that is used in gas turbine blade manufacture. The existing \(boron based\) casting die at Rautomead prevented its casting, hence a further investigation of alternative casting die materials to enable its casting \(Ca\-ZrO<sub>3</sub>\) was identified. This has led to considerable saving in time and material resources in trials **\[E1\]**. 

###  Enhanced casting quality/yield 

 The UoD casting expertise and analytical skills has enabled Rautomead to advance their technical capabilities **\[R1\-R3\]**. Enhancements include improving casting speed for oxygen\-free\-Cu \(OFCu\) rod used in data communication applications and particle accelerators, by identifying optimum conditions for increased casting yield and high quality **\[R2\]**. Since working with UoD, over the last 5 – 8 years the manufacturing yield of OFCu at Rautomead has approximately doubled \(from 2.5 m/min to 5 m/min\) enabling greater volumes of cast rod at reduced equipment costs **\[E1\]**. 

###  Development of new products and services 

 Since working with the UoD, Rautomead has improved its evidence\-based materials characterisation capability, allowing Rautomead to leverage technical innovations from its other R&D activities. This has led to the knowledge on the casting of new alloys to increase Rautomead’s offerings \(e.g., alloys such as CuMg, CuSn and CuAg\). Key examples include high value alloys Cu\-Cr\-Zr and Cu\-Zr, which display high electrical conductivity and post\-processing material strengthening **\[R2\]** and have a wide range of applications, e.g. as trolley wire within electric trains **\[E1\]**. 

 The work has contributed to a new piece of equipment which to date has resulted in 2 machine sales of this machine variant to Japanese customers \(valued at €954,000; Date: 2016\), and with a projected future sale of more than 10 machines over the next 2\-3 years. Other examples include Pb\-brass alloy used in corrosion resistance renewables \(valued at €538,000 machine sale to Korea; Date: 2017\), and Al\-bronze alloy for sub\-sea applications \(valued at €1,400,000 machine sale to Spain; Date: 2017\) **\[E1\]**. 

###  New company offerings to customers 

 Rautomead are now able to provide substantial material characterisation both during and after the actual trial\-casting process. This has provided a significant impact to the competitive position for the company and its international image which includes: 

-  Advancement of the casting\-trial process offered to customers due to improved characterisation techniques employed at UoD; 

-  Improved ‘product plus material characterisation analysis’ offering by Rautomead to customers, enabling significantly stronger technical and commercial selling of processing equipment; 

-  Enhanced technical image of the company within the market, as a company who can provide a proven and trustworthy solution to its customers, and considerable  publicity through dissemination of the research by Rautomead at Trade Shows \(e.g. International Foundry Trade Fair with Technical Forum \(GIFA\) that is globally attended by industrial experts and equipment supplies from across the casting/foundry industry, and Wire Association International Global Continuous Casting Forum \- Atlanta, USA – that is a forum for professionals within continuous casting technology to meet and exchange innovative ideas. 

 The drive to improve casting ability further has led to the continued investment of a new KTP with UoD \[Grant Number: 11042, Feb. 2018 – Feb. 2020\] on the development of bespoke modelling and simulation tools into the design process for continuous casting machines, and a new part\-time PhD studentship \(2016\-2022\), focussing on using the modelling and simulation tools to address the demand for low weight copper alloy wiring for the rapidly evolving automotive, aerospace and high speed rail markets. 

 In summary, the global reach of the partnership is evidenced by the number and diversity of machine sales across the world within the REF period, covering Americas, the Far East, Asia and Europe. The R&D collaboration between Rautomead and UoD has grown significantly, with ongoing links in provision of two Technology Support Agreements, investment in student projects at PhD and MSc levels, placements and visits to and with Rautomead, the employment of additional UoD graduates by the company \(Rautomead have increased their permanent staff by 10% since 2015\), and the aforementioned new KTP with UoD. This partnership has been, and will continue to be, of key strategic importance to the parties **\[E1\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 It is over 50 years since samples were returned from the Moon, but analysis of Apollo materials still provides surprises about our natural satellite, inspiring a new generation of space missions. Our research on lunar volatiles informed policy changes at ESA, underpins development of novel analysis and water extraction techniques for the space sector and helped to upskill schoolteachers. Impacts on **public policy, commerce and the economy** and **understanding, learning and participation** include: ESA’s new EUR1B exploration programme that highlights lunar exploration; award of contracts worth more than EUR40M to companies and subsequent creation of new jobs and development of a continued professional development package for teachers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research develops novel analytical methods to analyse extra\-terrestrial samples in the laboratory or *in situ* on space missions. Our findings advance fundamental planetary science, enable human and robotic space exploration, and are applied in new space products. 

 **Laboratory methods:** Since 2011, our STFC\-funded research has pioneered developments of several new analytical laboratory methods using nano secondary ion mass spectrometry \(NanoSIMS\), which for the first time not only revealed the presence of significant quantities of indigenous volatiles such as H and Cl in lunar samples but also their potential sources through their isotopic measurements. These findings helped change the 40\-year\-old paradigm of a ‘bone\-dry Moon’ **\[O1\]** and further identified the major source of water in the Moon **\[O2\]**. 

 **Space Instruments:** From 2000 to 2014 \(funded by STFC\), we developed and built a miniaturised analytical instrument, Ptolemy, which flew on the European Space Agency \(ESA\) Rosetta mission. Ptolemy was designed to study the surface and local atmosphere of the target, comet 67P Churyumov\-Gerasimenko. Our instrument successfully made the first *in situ* measurements of water and organic compounds on a comet **\[O3\]** and demonstrated heterogeneity across the two landing sites and in time **\[O4\]**. 

 With ESA funding, we are building on this success and developing the next generation of instruments for missions to the Moon. In this context, in 2017\-19 and funded by the UK Space Agency \(UKSA\), we developed a novel method for analysing extra\-terrestrial samples. It enables, for the first time, quantitative determination of multiple gases released through heating, using an order of magnitude smaller samples **\[O5\]**. 

 **Implications of ISRU:** *In Situ* Resource Utilisation is the concept of making use of materials found off\-Earth, significantly reducing the mass of a spacecraft and hence its launch cost and environmental impact. Water is the most important such resource: it can be used for human life support \(drinking, and a source of breathable oxygen\) and can be processed into hydrogen and oxygen as an energy source and rocket propellant. In 2016\-20, and funded by STFC, we developed and applied a novel thermochemical method for extracting oxygen and water from ‘dry’ Moon soil samples to be analysed *in situ* on the Moon by an ESA payload **\[O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our role in the discovery and understanding of the nature of water in lunar samples, coupled with our development of novel instrumentation for *in situ* analysis at the lunar surface, has underpinned impacts on **public policy \(at European and UK level\), commerce and the economy,** and **understanding, learning and participation**. The beneficiaries include space agencies, businesses \(SMEs and multinationals\) and school students and their teachers. 

 **Pathways to Impact** are through three routes: 

-  Using our standing in the scientific community and membership of influential committees to advance European and UK policies on lunar exploration. 

-  Collaborating with multiple UK and European companies who learned of the application of our expertise in space missions \(e.g., Rosetta Lander Philae\). 

-  Developing a research\-informed continued professional development package for schoolteachers, accompanied by engagement activities for schools, facilitated by the OU’s School of Physical Sciences’ Outreach and Public Engagement team. 

 **A. Impact on Policy: Strategies and Implementation of European and UK Space Policies** 

 Our research on lunar volatiles and instrument development has helped to foreground the Moon as a focus for space exploration and strengthened understanding of its potential for human habitation. We have been a key player in ensuring that lunar science and exploration is now embedded within ESA and UKSA roadmaps and that the Moon is a major strategic target for international partnerships. 

 <ins>Strategy Development:</ins> 

 In 2012, the ESA Ministerial Council failed to approve funding for a Lunar Lander because it was of insufficient priority compared with exploration of Mars. Following new discoveries in the field of lunar volatiles, including those made by **Anand** **\[O1, O2\]**, ESA started to develop a new lunar exploration strategy, which became a major part of the European Exploration Envelope Programme \(E3P\). The OU’s research played a significant role in developing the programme, as explained by the Lunar Resource Lander Team Leader at ESA \(hereafter ‘ESA LRLTL’\): 

 “*the significant impacts that \[ **Barber**, **Anand** and **Sheridan’s**\] research on lunar volatiles and instrumentation has had on the European Space Agency’s programme of robotic and human exploration \[…\] .there has been the need to build a broad scientific community and political support in Europe on this topic, to which OU has been contributing actively \[…\] \[the OU\]* *participates heavily in advisory scientific teams and groups \[and our\] inputs have supported ESA to define its strategy for lunar science and for resources utilization \[*… *\]* *which at the end contributed to the approval of a new batch of lunar studies and developments for several tens of millions Euros at the ESA Ministerial Council in 2016 and in 2019*” **\[C1\]**. 

 **Anand’s** lunar research has established him, since 2014, as the resident expert on lunar science and exploration on the highly influential European Space Science Committee \(ESSC\), in which role he led assessment of the E3P proposal. The ESSC Chair states: 

 “*the ESSC has a unique position in Europe providing independent scientific advice on space science matters to ESA, the European Commission \(EC\), national space agencies \[...\] **Anand** was instrumental in independently reviewing the ESA’s European Exploration Envelope Programme \(E3P\) proposal and helping shape the resulting recommendations to the ESA directors and Ministers. The proposal, presented by ESA to the Ministerial meeting in 2019, for the first time included explicit funding for lunar exploration \[…\], which eventually was approved by the Council of Ministers”* **\[C2\]**. 

 <ins>Strategy Implementation:</ins> 

 Implementation of lunar science and exploration activities at ESA has been strongly influenced by the novel analytical techniques we established through laboratory analysis of lunar samples **\[O1, O5\]** and applied the findings towards developing payload instruments for space missions **\[O3, O6\]**. The ESA LRLTL states: 

 “*we learned of the Open University’s instrumentation for volatiles analysis through their research in the ESA Rosetta comet mission \[…\] OU is also very much involved \[in ESA’s lunar strategy\] implementation via the development of different sample analysis instruments for lunar landers. Among the eight main scientific areas prioritised by ESA, four are fed by research and development work at OU \[…\] The OU team’s research and expertise has developed for ESA new technologies for lunar science and exploration, and specifically for finding, identifying and quantifying water ice and other important materials. These are recognised internationally as state\-of\-the\-art technologies, and have enabled ESA to negotiate with other space agencies to put OU\-built instruments on their lunar landers. The research has therefore enabled Europe to play a key and visible role in lunar science and exploration missions, on an international stage”* **\[C1\]**. 

 Our instrumentation and methods for *in situ* analysis have enabled ESA and UKSA to establish new international collaborations. \[Text removed for publication.\] **\[C3\]**. 

 Such opportunities include ESA payloads  [<ins>on the Russian Luna\-27 lander</ins>](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/One_step_closer_to_prospecting_the_Moon) and in  [<ins>NASA’s return to the Moon with the Artemis program</ins>](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/a-few-experiments-flying-to-moon-on-commercial-landers). 

 Our research into ISRU is already showing impact on strategy. The ESA LRLTL states 

 “*the novel techniques and instruments developed at OU are increasingly in demand on the international stage \[…\] ESA is already in negotiations with other space agencies including NASA \(US\) and JAXA \(Japan\) to develop future instruments \(via OU\) for future missions to the Moon. ESA may work with OU on new instrument technologies such as instrumented drills and ISRU instruments, like in the frame of the future European Large Logistics Lander \(EL3\) mission currently under study by ESA. This might open up new areas of robotic and human exploration through lowering the costs of prolonged presence in space”* **\[C1\]**. 

 **B. Impacts of our analytical technique developments upon Business and the Economy** 

 By developing world\-leading capability in analytical instruments for prospecting and analysing water \(volatiles\) on missions to the Moon underpinned by our body of research, we have created multiple strategic opportunities for European and UK businesses of various sizes which have already started delivering significant growth and new income streams. We have collaborated with the Italian company Leonardo to develop the  [<ins>PROSPECT</ins>](https://exploration.esa.int/web/moon/-/59102-about-prospect) payload for ESA. Their Head of Space explains: 

 “*we did not have the expertise to develop the sample analysis instrument for PROSPECT, and so we entered into discussions with OU as recognised experts in this field, and agreed to collaborate \[…\] with OU responsible for the development activities for the sample analysis instrument called ‘<ins>ProSPA</ins>’ which is complementary to the Leonardo\-led drill ‘ProSEED’ \[…\]. The strength of the bidding team and our proposal was recognised when ESA awarded an EUR8,400,000 \[12.07.16\] contract to Leonardo in 2016 for PROSPECT development model*” **\[C4\]**. 

 The collaboration successfully delivered this phase of the project and submitted its proposal for the next phase. The Head of Space said 

 “*ESA awarded a contract in January 2020 to Leonardo for a \[further\]* *EUR31,500,000 for the development of PROSPECT flight model. Again, OU is the major project collaborator \[…\]. The research of OU into lunar samples, ices and volatiles and mini science laboratories has been very important for us. Our collaboration with OU has led to these two very important contracts for the company and has secured a role for us in a new and the growing market for lunar exploration missions which previously we had not been involved in. The employment of highly skilled staff is a significant part of the cost of a space product, and so contracts of this value secure many tens of existing and new jobs in our company and in the supply chain in the various countries that support our work on PROSPECT*” **\[C4\]**. 

 Four UK SMEs are key players in PROSPECT, supplying services and/or technology. One example is Fluid Gravity Engineering \(FGE\) Ltd. The FGE Company Director says: 

 “W *e were missing out in the growing field of lunar exploration because our expertise in atmospheres was thought to be irrelevant on the airless Moon. However, in 2011 your team at OU approached us in the context of your research into the in situ analysis of lunar samples, and suggested that our proprietary techniques could be developed to model the artificial atmosphere created by the exhaust gases emitted by a lunar lander. Our subsequent R&D collaborations with OU have proved the value of these approaches \[text removed for publication\]. This financial benefit, and the fact that these projects are prestigious and exciting to work on, has been significant in retaining our workforce of 24 highly skilled employees. We have also been the only SME invited to attend high\-level strategy planning meetings convened by ESA with multi\-national space conglomerates. I do not believe that we would be pursuing this new line of business without our association with OU’s research into lunar volatiles and instrumentation techniques*” **\[C5\]**. 

 A second UK SME example is Dynamic Imaging Analytics. Its CEO states: 

 “W *e submitted a proposal to OU to use our novel 3D camera technology in their PROSPECT project looking for water in lunar samples. The resulting collaboration in 2016\-17 enabled us to make our first step into the European space sector, which is an important step for us as a new tech start\-up \[…\]. The collaboration with OU’s team led to us developing a family of new camera products for the space market to support exploration for water on the Moon \[…\] this new business line has secured multiple income streams comprising more than half of our total income in the period 2016\-2020, underpinning our sustainable growth from 1 to 5 employees*” **\[C6\]**. 

 Belgian SME Space Applications Services has developed new business lines through its interaction with our research. Its Technologies, Applications & Research Manager states: 

 “W *e were fundamentally lacking sufficient scientific insight and understanding of the key scientific motivations and priorities for lunar exploration. Through a series of discussions and interactions with OU \(Dr. Simon **Sheridan** and Dr. Simeon **Barber** in particular\), we realized the prominence of volatiles detection as an overarching area of interest in the community, with extremely concrete and promising middle to long term commercial prospects*” **\[C7\]**. 

 They further state that the first funded collaboration with us received the following evaluation: 

 “*This is an amazing project where the team has delivered exceptional results with significant immediate or potential impact \[…\]OU’s novel techniques, technologies and partnership has played a part in helping Space Applications Services secure funding to the tune of nearly EUR5M \[...\] from February 2017 to December 2020 with our share of that income having enabled us to employ 10\-12 staff and additionally 8\-10 interns on 6 month contracts*” **\[C7\]**. 

 The incorporation of ISRU into ESA policy has led to several new jobs in Europe as confirmed by the ESA LRLTL: 

 “*Thanks to this momentum, ESA could also start to gather a group of experts and researchers in its centers of ESTEC \(The Netherlands\), ECSAT \(UK\) and EAC \(Germany\) on ISRU*” **\[C1\]**. 

 **C. Impact on Understanding, Learning and Participation** 

 One of the most important aspects of any research programme is the impact it can make through inspiration of school students, acknowledging that they are our next generation of scientists and engineers. Impact comes from provision of resources to schools to enhance science education \- but is greatly increased if teachers have confidence in their own skills and knowledge in teaching the material. We have an active  [<ins>Outreach and Engagement Programme</ins>](http://www.open.ac.uk/science/physical-science/external-engagement/outreach-and-public-engagement) and have used the vision of sustainable exploration enabled by lunar science and ISRU to engage a variety of audiences, especially school students, in a greater awareness of the importance and excitement of space exploration. 

 One specific example is our ‘Living on the Moon’ project which is a progression from the exhibition we designed and ran for the highly\-competitive  [<ins>Royal Society Summer Exhibition</ins>](http://www.open.ac.uk/science/physical-science/external-engagement/outreach-and-public-engagement/case-study-living-moon) in July 2019 \(and which we were invited to reprise on\-line in summer 2020\). In partnership with The Ogden Trust and the South East Physics Network \(SEPnet\) we have developed a multi\-interventional educational and outreach programme for school students. A central component of the programme is a continuing professional development element for teachers. In November 2020, we ran a pilot at a local primary school. We engaged with 3 teachers and 3 teaching assistants along with 79 pupils from years 5 and 6 over a period of 3 weeks. 

 The partner school was rated by OFSTED as ‘requiring improvements’ with only 2% of its KS2 pupils achieving at a higher standard in reading, writing and mathematics compared with the national average of 11%. A significant proportion of the pupils are underprivileged, with 20% eligible for free school meals. 

 Evaluation comprised comparison of pre\- and post\-intervention data and showed an increase in knowledge about the Moon among the pupils and an increase in the number of students discussing lunar research with their families. In particular, feedback from teachers suggested marked changes in pupils’ aspirations, engagement, and awareness of STEM careers and of what is possible by studying science and mathematics. 

 Teachers’ feedback included **\[C8**, pp.1\-2 **\]**: 

 *“The very fact that you provided resources for the experiments \[…\] ensured that we have actually done those practical experiments. We’ve learnt a lot*” \(p.1\). 

 “*because we were talking to people \[*who were experts in their field *\] \[…\] that’s really enabled \[our children\] to understand the jobs that people do within science beyond just learning lessons in school, which has been really inspiring”* \(p.1\). 

 *“I had a limited knowledge, but you don’t realise how much your own knowledge grows \[…\] When the children had talked about it afterwards \[…\] I’ve been able to really scaffold that because my own knowledge has grown and I feel that has brought the children’s confidence on because I have been able to help them make more sense of it \[...\]. I think my class got the most because our children come from different backgrounds. The children that we teach need to have that aspiration within themselves to believe that they can do what they want to do”.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In England alone, 370,000 people have a rare genetic syndrome that causes intellectual disability. This is a neglected population at high risk of behavioural and emotional disorder. Aston\-led research has analysed profiles of behaviour in multiple rare genetic syndromes and applied the results to develop FIND \(<ins> **F**</ins>urther <ins> **I**</ins>nform <ins> **N**</ins>eurogenetic <ins> **D**</ins>isorders\), the first online, *accessible* resource to inform multiple stakeholders of behavioural and emotional consequences resulting from specific, rare genetic syndromes. In collaboration with support groups, FIND has significantly influenced awareness, understanding and the behaviour of parents, clinicians and educators internationally. 

 Impacts on **Understanding, Learning & Participation**, **Health & Wellbeing** and **Practitioners & Delivery of Professional Services** are claimed. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background:** The White Paper ‘Together for health: a strategic approach for the EU 2008\-2013’ and subsequent ‘Recommendation on an action in the field of rare diseases’ identified rare conditions as an international priority. The need for specific advice regarding behavioural profiles of genetic syndromes remains substantial. Prior research indicated that families regularly seek information tailored to their child’s syndrome, but the lack of evidenced\-based guidance leaves families with extreme uncertainty and places children at high risk of persistent and severe behavioural disorder. Behavioural disorder includes self\-injurious behaviour \(e.g. head\-banging, eye gouging\), aggression, rigid repetitive behaviours and life\-impairing anxiety. 

 Behavioural disorder is a serious source of psychological distress; particularly when families are unable to understand what is happening to their loved one. A substantial proportion of parents reach cut\-off for clinically significant anxiety \(> 50%\) and depression \(> 30%\). NICE guidance also emphasises how behavioural disorder impacts the person displaying that behaviour, by elevating the likelihood of children being taken into care, placement breakdown and restrictive and abusive practices. The average cost of an annual placement for someone showing behaviour disorder is £200,000. 

 **Underpinning research:** Waite’s Aston\-based research has elucidated the syndrome\-specific behavioural profiles of eight of the ten rare genetic syndromes featured in FIND. Research into each of these syndromes was performed in collaboration with support charities \(e.g. **S3.1\-3.2, S3.4 & S3.6**\). Updates to current knowledge regarding Cornelia de Lange \( **S3.4**\), Lowe, Prader\-Willi, fragile\-X and Williams syndromes have resulted from Aston\-based research that cuts across groups \( **S3.1, S3.2\-3.3, S3.5**\). Further research into Rubinstein\-Taybi \( **S3.6**\), Kleefstra, Angelman and Bardet\-Biedl syndromes is ongoing in current programmes \( **S3, research grants**\). 

 **Research insights/findings:** Underpinning research has determined that particular genetic syndromes are at *far* *greater risk* than other syndromes of specific types for behaviour disorder and has identified causal mechanisms leading to these differences \( **S3.1\-S3.6**\). This includes new insights into adaptive behaviour difficulties, severe temper\-outbursts, self\-injurious behaviour, aggressive behaviour, repetitive behaviours, anxiety, mood related difficulties and health/sensory difficulties across syndromes. For example, people with Williams syndrome are four times more likely to experience persistent life\-limiting anxiety than people in the general population, and this is now known to be associated with underlying sensory processing problems in this syndrome \( **S3.1, S3.5**\). 

 Aston\-based research also cuts across syndromes and disorders. For example, research examining mechanisms of temper outbursts in Lowe syndrome has indicated similar mechanisms as in Prader\-Willi syndrome \( **S3.2**\), so highlighting the importance of raising awareness of findings across groups \(e.g. **S3.3**\), as well as within those groups. 

 **Key Contextual Information:** There is currently a lag of \~10 years between scientific publication in the field of psychology and subsequent changes to clinical practice. To address this gap, there is an urgent need for accessible summaries of research findings, training aids and resources to be made available to parents for advocacy purposes. These resources are also needed for clinicians, to accelerate the application of new knowledge in clinical settings; particularly in relation to rare and neglected groups.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 While a postdoc at the University of Birmingham \(2014\-2017, PI Prof. Chris Oliver\), Waite established a new online resource, FIND \(<ins> **F**</ins>urther <ins> **I**</ins>nform <ins> **N**</ins>eurogenetic <ins> **D**</ins>isorders\).  As an Aston academic, Waite now leads FIND which is still hosted at UoB, through an Aston/UoB collaboration. Impacts described herein are restricted to those from September 2017 onwards \(i.e. Waite’s Aston\-based research; **S5.1**\). 

 FIND now details ten rare genetic syndromes \( **S5.2**\). Four of these: Rubinstein\-Taybi \(RTS\), Lowe, Kleefstra and Williams syndromes were developed by Waite’s group at Aston, following research in collaboration with support charities \( **S3.1, S3.2, S3.6**\). An additional four syndromes: Angelman, Cornelia de Lange, Fragile X and Prader\-Willi, have been renewed/updated by Waite since 2019, based on her cross\-syndrome research \( **S3.1\-3.4**\). 

 From translation of Waite’s Aston research into accessible summaries, videos, assessment manuals and training aids \(delivered via the FIND website\) the following impacts on patients, their families and on practitioners are claimed: 

 **Impact on understanding, learning and participation:** In 2018, 87% of 104 surveyed users said they would re\-visit FIND. In 2020, following Waite’s updates of 2019, online feedback from 350 users revealed that 90% strongly\-agreed/agreed that FIND improved their knowledge; 88% would recommend FIND to others and 91% found FIND easy to understand. Google Analytics show that FIND accumulates > 100K new web sessions per year. These are significant numbers, given the scarcity of the rare disorders addressed. FIND has global traction with key audiences comprising the United States \(42%\), the UK \(24%\), Australia \(6%\), Canada \(6%\) and India \(2%\) \( **S5.3**\). Qualitative feedback \( **S5.4**\) also illustrates impact e.g. *“*I am a parent of a 13 year\-old girl and I am also a learning disability nurse…the website has provided the most informative and accurate information I have ever read.”; “Mother of a 9 year old. We live in the U.S. love the info here.”; “I'm in Japan but not enough information of PWS found in JPN website” \(parent\); “My daughter goes through bouts of aggression and I now know this is actually part of the syndrome” and “I'm a leader of the dutch CdLS group, can use this to help our families”. Within the UK, support groups circulate FIND via their mailing lists and estimate that between 20% and 90% of all UK families affected \(according to syndrome\) have been reached \( **S5.5**\). 

 Six RTS videos that Waite developed with RTS\-UK detail RTS characteristics and recommendations for behaviour management \( **S5.6**\) and have already accumulated >2000 views via FIND \( **S5.3**\). Qualitative feedback demonstrates their transformative impact e.g. *“*The syndrome is so rare that most of the info online is about the actual presentation and diagnosis. It was great to see the pictures/videos of others with RTS and realize that some behaviours are fairly characteristic and syndrome related. I hope to share this web\-site and videos with behaviour therapists and his \(special needs\) school teachers *”* \(Canadian family, **S5.4** *\).* 

 **Impact on Health and Wellbeing:** Aston researchers have given invited presentations of FIND resources at 5 syndrome\-support conferences, leading to parent empowerment e.g. *“*They inspired me to come home and make a bigger fuss to get to the bottom of why \[son\] was biting himself and lashing out….– they were right, \[son\] had a stomach ulcer\! *”* and from another family: *“*Information \[Waite\] sent to me was vital helping the authorities understand her needs and constant vulnerability for \[daughter’s\] Personal Independent Plan assessment, and \[during\] a very distressing court case, the district Judge in particular took time to read it, and made good reference to it, resulting in onward support and counselling for \[daughter\]” *\(* **S5.7**\). Meanwhile, qualitative feedback from the website demonstrates similar influence e.g. “My state/country U.S. are cutting services for the disabled and this information is going to be so helpful in keeping the services which he presently has” \(parent; **S5.4**\). 

 **Impact on Practitioners and the Delivery of Professional Services:** Qualitatively, teachers have found the FIND website helpful e.g. “sections allow us to become quickly conversant with the syndrome.  The photos and videos were particularly helpful. Truly a lifesaver… for a number of us” and “I am from Australia and these resources will be used throughout my service” \(disability support provider\) \( **S5.4**\). FIND is also cited in a core text and in course reading lists for trainee clinical psychologists \( **S5.8**\) and FIND training for these professionals has had tangible real\-world benefits: e.g. “Having this increased understanding meant the family were, as a unit, more willing to engage with me in implementing a programme to reduce \[client’s\] repetitive behaviour *”* and *“*this training has made a massive difference. I feel more confident re behavioural assessments and phenotypes and will now explore the possible impacts of genetic syndromes more readily during behavioural assessments *”* \( **S5.9**\). 

 In Dec\-2019, a manual of 12 research questionnaires \( **S5.10**\), co\-authored by Aston and Birmingham, was launched through FIND. The manual has already accumulated 618 downloads representing represent 37 countries, 104 NHS Trusts/organisations, 23 international hospitals/healthcare organisations, 17 government bodies and councils, 10 charities and 7 schools. 

 **In summary**, FIND addresses the 10\-year lag between research and implementation by providing parents, clinicians and educators worldwide with urgently\-required, up\-to\-date and importantly, *accessible* information and guidance about rare neurogenetic disorders.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 <ins> *ILIAD*</ins><ins>, a large\-scale, internationally acknowledged theatre production commissioned and produced by National Theatre Wales \(NTW\) created a verbatim intermedial staging of the entirety of Christopher Logue’s epic poem ‘War Music’. The production was the first time Logue</ins><ins>’</ins><ins>s text had been staged in full, and expanded the ways epic narrative poetry might resonate with, and be performed in, the contemporary cultural context.</ins> 

 <ins> *ILIAD*</ins> <ins>offered an immersive and durational theatre experience within a modern theatre auditorium and informed creative, technical and administrative procedures for located theatre practices. In so doing, the work had an impact upon:</ins> 

 <ins>1\) Cultural life</ins> – <ins>in enriching public appreciation, understanding and imagination by generating new forms of artistic expression and in enhancing the status of NTW;</ins> 

 <ins>2\) Professional practice</ins> – <ins>in informing programming and in generating new ways of thinking that influence production practices.</ins> 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Conceptual and creative work on</ins> <ins> *ILIAD*</ins> <ins>\[3.1\] was underpinned by Brookes and Pearson</ins><ins>’</ins><ins>s long\-term scholarly and practice\-based research on site\-specific performance and located performance making. The work included their reflections on practical methodologies for, and critical and theoretical approaches to, context\-specific performance and location. The research manifest through</ins> <ins> *ILIAD*</ins> <ins>specifically marked a turning point in this long\-term trajectory, by engaging these approaches in the development of new forms and practices within</ins> <ins>‘</ins><ins>traditional’</ins> <ins>theatre auditoria staging and production processes. This further expanded the authors’ inquiry into located and site\-specific theatre practices by addressing the specificity of theatre as a site itself; and in particular the new and developing Ffwrnes theatre auditorium in Llanelli in South Wales, and its possible</ins> <ins>spatial</ins> <ins>configuration</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>and uses, as well as its potential functions as a cultural center in context.</ins> 

 This inquiry led to new approaches to the intermedial staging of poetic text. This development necessitated the collaborative facilitation of project\-specific cinematographic and video production practices; the development of spatially active audio architectures; vocal techniques appropriate for the complex mediated environment of the work; and brought together a select team of expert and emerging practitioners, including local and international collaborators, in its realisation and presentation. It was supported by Brookes and Pearson’s extensive experience of professional production, nationally and internationally, acquired both as independent artists and researchers, and through their collaboration as Pearson / Brookes \(2000–2017\). It was informed by Brookes’ extensive practice\-based research within intermedial, located live and public art work, which has been widely commissioned and presented across Europe, Asia, Australasia, South America, and USA. This on\-going research has included related investigations within context\-specific, task\-based, situational and interventional performance practices supported by a series of notable and internationally realised public outputs \[3.2–3.5\]. It was further advanced by Brookes’ additional research and design collaborations within the industry, including his on\-going collaborative work \(2009–present\) with Stewart Laing and Glasgow\-based company Untitled Projects; and his enduring collaborations \(2002–present\) with Manchester\-based theatre company Quarantine and departmental colleague Simon Banham, who is a founding member of that company. 

 Brookes and Pearson, along with Banham, have played a leading role in the development of practice\-based research in the Department, through their individual and collaborative research and outputs, and through Brookes and Banham’s involvement with the *Scenography, Performance and the Everyday* departmental research cluster. Their practical investigations as solo artists and in collaboration are attested in scholarly literature in the field and beyond. The collaboration with NTW is further contextualised and informed by Brookes’ longstanding explorations into intermedial performance practices and can be seen to draw directly on his doctoral research into processes of mediation within the formal and dramaturgical structuring of located performance work, successfully completed in 2015 \[3.6\]. Research that, in turn, expands on approaches and understandings of site and context\-oriented practice that have proved key to the collaboration, and which have been extensively detailed within Pearson’s scholarly research on site\-specific performance \[3.7, 3.8\]. 

 <ins>The collaboration with NTW has greatly enhanced and privileged this practice\-based research, undertaken in the public sphere: in developing new forms of mediated performance; in combining traditions of textual and physical theatre; in devising complex occupations and scenographic investigations of the spatial and social context; and expanding approaches to intermedial and located performance practices for audiences within a modern theatre auditorium.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 ‘The work made by Brookes and Pearson … has helped support and grow the Welsh theatre ecology and has significantly encouraged a younger generation of artists to be more ambitious with their ideas and approaches’ – Former Artistic Director, NTW \(2019\) 

 <ins>The research enhanced cultural discourse by bringing to the public’s attention</ins> <ins>the aesthetic and presentational possibilities of the hybridisation of live art, dramatic stage practices and media.</ins> <ins>It offered</ins> <ins>original artistic experiences to contemporary audiences and expanded</ins> <ins>creative, technical and administrative procedures for located and context\-specific creation and production practices.</ins> 

 Within this general perspective, the impact of this research has been twofold: 

####  **On cultural life \(in enriching public appreciation and imagination by generating new forms of artistic expression and in enhancing the status of NTW\)** 

 Public and industry recognition of the achievements embodied by *ILIAD* demonstrate a key acknowledgement: that research\-driven, innovative theatre and located public art practices \- often confined to the realm of the theatrical fringe – can have significant critical and popular appeal when enacted within the context of national theatre. Both full marathon performances of the four\-part work in its entirety – the first of which took place throughout the day of 26 September 2015, and the second over the night of 3 October 2015 – sold out; though audiences were inevitably limited by the nature of the production and venue \(capacity 250 spectators\). The production was enthusiastically reviewed, both in the Welsh and UK press, including a five\-star review in *The Guardian* \(September 2015\), which noted ‘Iliad is certainly the theatrical event of the year. It may be the theatrical event of the decade’ \[5.1\]. The production was included amongst the body of Greek theatre adaptations collectively listed within *The Independent’s* ‘Top 10 cultural events of the year’ \[5.2\]. 

 Individual public comments and reactions to the work’s full marathon performances, which included those of industry professionals who attended as audience members, attest to the impact on public appreciation: ‘Mike Brookes and Pearson reinvent theatre – thrilling overwhelming exhausting inspiring ILIAD’; ‘Iliad marathon – envelope pushing theatre – brilliant cast, sound and scenography – PHENOMENAL‘ \[5.3\]; ‘... hundreds of plastic garden chairs were thrown into a pile against a rear wall, my heart was racing until I thought it might burst. It felt extraordinarily thrilling and immense and terrible and extraordinary. It’s the best thing I saw this year. It might just be the best thing I’ve seen in a theatre’ \[5.4\]. 

 <ins>The work has also had an important impact on the cultural life of the nation, and in particular the continued development of the nation</ins><ins>’</ins><ins>s English language national theatre company, National Theatre Wales \(NTW\), into an internationally recognised cultural organization.</ins> <ins> *ILIAD*</ins> <ins>both consolidated and greatly expanded the contributions of previous work by the authors to the company’s goals, further demonstrating the potential and feasibility of context\-specific work within NTW</ins><ins>’</ins><ins>s portfolio of presentational practices, as a means to address diverse audiences with challenging, innovative and participatory forms of theatre. It embodied intermedial approaches pioneered by the authors and developed new aural and audiovisual elements and interactions. This further expanded the performative conventions and possibilities of the work, to include both durational and task\-based physical performance</ins> <ins>with dramatic vocal text delivery, as well as combining live and pre\-recorded performers;</ins> **and applying expertise in site\-specific and located art practices to large\-scale stage work within the social context, locale and conventions of a new mainstream theatre building. The NTW’s former Artistic Director attests the production’s influence on the company’s development, noting how it had been:** 

 ‘\[A\] seminal and significant work in the cannon of National Theatre Wales’ artistic output. The contribution to and the development of new approaches to theatre making or the fusing of different technologies with more formal theatre forms to create challenging and thrilling theatrical experiences have been important strands of our work as a national company. \[ILIAD\] successfully pushed the boundaries of the art\-form’ \[5.5\]. 

 The production concluded the authors’ five\-year working relationship with NTW’s founding Artistic Director and provided the cornerstone for a propositional new phase of development under the company’s second and incoming Artistic Director. Brookes was invited to enter into a further three\-year period as Artistic Associate to the company and also invited to develop and present an exploratory series of new public works \(initially in collaboration with Pearson\) under the working title *The Storm Cycle*, further enhancing NTW’s aims and ability to mount work of international standard and bring in ‘new collaborators and audiences’ *.* \[5.5\] 

####  **On professional practice \(in informing programming and in generating new ways of thinking that influence production practices\)** 

 <ins>The range and levels of expertise brought together within the realisation and performance of</ins> <ins> *ILIAD*</ins> <ins>was unprecedented for many of the Wales\-based theatre professionals engaged within its production. The work brought together a select team of exceptional and award\-winning professional practitioners in technical, creative and performance roles. It also integrated, within the practices and processes facilitated by that team, an equally diverse range of young and emerging professionals: including technical and production</ins> <ins> </ins><ins>assistants, recent creative graduates, as well as local teenage performers. The expert support and skills exchange amongst these professionals facilitated consistently high and uncompromised production values, as well as the realisation of innovative, complex and technically sophisticated media architectures and aesthetics. These collaborations and exchanges inform subsequent practices and possibilities, not only for NTW, but for the individual collaborating professionals and emerging practitioners themselves</ins> – <ins>through the rigorous and expanded approaches necessitated by the production, through the resulting contacts and skills development amongst collaborating colleagues, and through their public visibility within acknowledgements of the wider achievements of the work as a whole. NTW’s Head of Production notes how</ins> *ILIAD* was a ‘key opportunity and achievement’ for the company, and one which significantly advanced its practice and technical ambition: 

 ‘The approaches and intentions of ILIAD provoked a production environment within which people had room to do what they do best, in ways that both stretched and supported them. \[It provided\] them with the clarity of intention, resources and time needed to push their expertise into new territory’ \[5.6\]. 

 <ins>One section of the cast, for example, subsequently continued to work together as a separate performance collective</ins> – <ins>attracting public funding and public commissions for their continued collaboration within professional contexts in both Wales and Spain. And a then recent graduate of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama \(RWCMD\) engaged within the sound work of the production, for whom</ins> <ins> *ILIAD*</ins> <ins>was the first major production experience, has subsequently gone on to work extensively with the multi BAFTA award winning compositional studio John Hardy Music, as well as further collaborations with NTW. As the Director of John Hardy Music states, in relation to the studio’s involvement with the project:</ins> 

 ‘One of the more enduring practical legacies of the production, beyond the many notable approaches and proposals of the work itself, has perhaps been the extent to which its working practices and production environment were able to include and encourage outstanding contributions from a number of young and emerging professionals. I was, for example, able to place two recent graduates joining my studio in key roles within the development and performance of our work for ILIAD. One of whom has since become a valued member of the creative team. The experiences and understandings gained from ILIAD have continued to provide an invaluable platform for their ongoing achievements’ \[5.7\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at the University of Bolton \(UoB\) has improved the method of reporting of injuries within professional Rugby League. The research has informed and contributed to improved standards of player care and welfare within the professional game, specifically with regards to concussion injuries. An online electronic surveillance tool, designed and developed at the UoB, captured injury data during the period 2013 – 2018, throughout the competitive seasons. The annual findings were presented to the governing body, and each of the Super League clubs \(2013 until 2018\) and led directly to a change in bylaws regarding concussion data\-collection and subsequent management.

1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Concussion is regarded as a major area of concern in contact\-sports by sports medicine practitioners. Further, the long\-term consequences can be problematic, with research suggesting a link between concussion and Chronic traumatic encephalopathy \(CTE\). 

 Rugby League \(RL\) is an invasive contact sport played competitively across the world. Two teams of 13\-players play over 80\-minutes; predominantly on a grass field. The game is intermittent and involves high\-intensity activities separated by low\-intensity periods of active recovery. Due to the nature of the game, the amount of high\-impact collisions that result in injuries are considerably high. 

 Injury surveillance is essential for identifying the level of injury risk associated with participation and performance, and likewise to underpin current and future safety practices. It was reported in 2009 that should athletes follow proper guidelines for return to play after a concussion, it was possible that the frequency of sports\-related CTE could be dramatically reduced or prevented \(McKee, 2009\). 

 The research produced confidential reports for both the Rugby Football League \(RFL\), and an anonymised version for each of the clubs, and published as part of a funded research project on behalf of the RFL, together with a peer\-reviewed three\-year epidemiological prospective cohort study of rugby league match injuries. 

 The aim of the research was to capture injury surveillance data and report on match injury trends from all teams competing in the Super League \(SL\) by employing a consensus\-driven prospective cohort design. Data was captured during the competitive seasons 2013 \- 2018 and collected via an online\-reporting survey tool; underpinned by nominal group technique\-agreed \(NGT\) definitions. The pilot of the surveillance tool was conducted during the latter months of the 2012 season, where the final surveillance electronic format was refined following user feedback which enhanced the usability of the online tool. During this period, training sessions were provided for all of the SL medical staff who were to use the surveillance system at their respective club.  To optimise inter\-rater reliability, injury definitions were defined and explained to each user of the electronic tool.  Each SL club was given individual access to the online survey tool via unique login; aligned with data protection regulations. The authors maintained the accessibility to, and training on, the electronic system for new medical staff, enabling new user access and user coaching to ensure injury descriptors were adhered to. 

 The main findings are an Injury incidence of 56.9 injuries per 1000 hours, with an average of 33.8 days missed per injury.  Further, 13% of all injuries were recurrent, accounting for a greater time\-loss per\-injury \(45.2 days\) than new injuries \(31.8 days\).  Concussions \(7.1 injuries per 1000 hours\) were the most commonly diagnosed injuries, although the knee joint \(18.3 injuries per 1000 hours\) was the most frequently injured area. Prior to the change in bylaws regarding how concussion data was collected, the average number of players suffering concussions \(2013 – ’15\) was 29, increasing to 50 once improved data\-collection methods were in place and enforced.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact accounted for in this case study is three\-fold, the initial phase of the research developed capacity within the field of injury surveillance in rugby league and set a new precedent regarding how research in this area is defined and structured. Following this, as the research findings where disseminated so too was a better understanding of how injuries should be captured and documented during both game and training to provide a complete insight into all factors of influence. Since the research has been influential in the development of new regulations published by the sport’s governing body, with regards to the reporting of concussions, the impact of this work now extends into areas of player welfare and corporate responsibility. 

 The legal duty of care of employers and governing bodies in sport is to assess the risks associated with participation and reduce such risks where possible. The Injury Surveillance project was implemented to inform and guide this requirement, and extend the body of knowledge concerning injury risk, severity, and trends in Rugby League. This work has informed all of those currently practising in a medical, strength and conditioning, or skill capacity within the game. 

 The research was carried out by members of the Sport and Biological Sciences team at the University of Bolton, and so far produced one peer\-reviewed publication titled ‘A three\-year epidemiological prospective cohort study of rugby league match injuries from the European Super League’ \(Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport\), and was the first research paper to include data from every athlete from every team across a complete elite\-level of sporting competition. It has since attracted the attention of other domestic and global governing bodies; principally the Rugby Football Union \(England, UK\), and the National Rugby League \(Australia\). Since its inception, the research has produced annual executive reports for the head of medicine and the head of player welfare at the RFL. 

 The findings have also been presented at three RFL performance conferences; 2016 \(Leeds\), 2017 \(Huddersfield, and Chester\). An executive presentation was also made at the head office of the RFL in February 2017, engaging the senior executives of the RFL in a forum which provided the opportunity for questions; exploring how the key data and findings might inform policy and practice. Following this presentation to senior executives at the RFL it was acknowledged that immediate changes were required, and the bylaws regarding the reporting of concussions within the game was updated; based primarily on the Injury surveillance data. 

 These changes to bylaws have led to greater attention and consideration of concussion injuries within the sport, and consequently more accurate reporting of injuries which significantly increases a clubs’ ability to ensure adequate guidelines for return to play after a concussion. The advancements in injury surveillance have the potential to improve the quality of life \(both during and after a players’ career\) and will contribute towards reducing the risk of sports related CTE in rugby league. 

 The increased awareness and changes to bylaws within the game then attracted international interest as within the rugby league community as In April 2017, the principal investigators \(Fitzpatrick, Naylor, and Robertson\) were invited to the National Rugby League \(NRL\) Head offices \(Sydney, Australia\) to share initial findings and discuss the main observations of the Injury Surveillance. The development of the injury surveillance tool has evolved considerably and now provides deeper insights into the factors that relate to all aspects of the game of Rugby League. Most notably, it has significantly improved practice within the reporting and tracking of injuries through enabling the medical staff at clubs to analyse live data capture and feedback. As a result, the staff at the clubs are now in a position where they can make immediate changes to practice based on the most current information. This change in practice is a large step towards significantly enhancing player welfare within the sport of rugby league around the world. 

 Since January 2019, a partnership between the University of Bolton, The RFL, and Leeds Beckett University has been established, the first publication from which \(Rugby league ball carrier injuries: The relative importance of tackle characteristics during the European Super League\) has recently been accepted for publication \(Sept 2020\). The new partnership provides a unique resource for further studies, and as such the enhanced dissemination of knowledge, The Injury Surveillance tool continues to serve PhD studies, and has already established a new set of standardized terms and definitions by which injury within the sport can be categorized and investigated.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Environmental DNA \(eDNA\) can be used to characterise living organisms from any substrate \(water, air, soil, sediment of water bodies etc.\). eDNA is a very powerful tool to monitor biodiversity that outperforms traditional survey methods in terms of efficiency and sensitivity and it is non\-invasive and easy to standardise. Research teams at Imperial College, led by Savolainen and Vogler, have used eDNA techniques to transform the way ecological monitoring is conducted. This has been achieved, firstly, via a successful start\-up company, NatureMetrics Ltd, co\-founded by Imperial College currently with 30 staff. Additionally, we have seen the wide uptake of eDNA by ecological consultancies in the UK; the development of efficient services for government mandated tests of endangered great crested newt; country\-wide surveys of pollinator communities; novel methods for water filtration method and sensitive methods for individual\-species or wider biodiversity audits brought to market internationally and nationally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The work led to a wider use of novel DNA\-based approaches to taxonomy and biodiversity research in environmental monitoring, through applied research and direct involvement with the commercial sector. The use of eDNA involves two types of technology, the detection of single species using targeted high\-sensitivity qPCR assays and the bulk analysis of mixed species communities using ‘metabarcoding’ and metagenomics. Research at Imperial contributed to both approaches **\[1\-5\]**.  Single\-species detection for the endangered great crested newt was based on published protocols but its commercial availability in the UK was limited.  Imperial researchers optimised the assay and rolled out widely to the ecological services industry, with funds from an Impact Acceleration Award \(2014\) and a Follow\-on grant of NERC \(2015\). This work led to the formation of a start\-up company, NatureMetrics, where these assays provided an early revenue stream. Related assays for invasive American signal crayfish were developed and eDNA quantification established that concentration levels correlate closely with egg\-bearing females **\[1\]**; this has warned end users of eDNA technology that estimating densities of animals using eDNA is season specific.  Research is also being done to use eDNA for monitoring shark populations by the Zoological Society of London. Furthermore, single\-species sensitive detection methods were developed for conservation purposes, specifically to assess the presence of otters in Bornean rivers, and a technique to monitor hazel dormouse visits of nest tubes using new protocols for DNA extracted from urine. The second approach for eDNA surveying based on bulk environmental samples originated from DNA taxonomy studies at Imperial and the Natural History Museum London, in part funded by their Biodiversity Initiative \(2013\-2016\) led by Vogler \(who holds a joint appointment\). This approach using alternatively shotgun sequencing \(metagenomic\) and PCR amplification \(metabarcoding\), required extensive method development to optimise laboratory protocols and bioinformatics **\[4\]**. Combining both techniques provides reliable assessment of mixed species communities from the environment **\[4\]**. Proof\-of\-concept studies for eDNA analyses were carried out on mud samples from the shore in Harwich Estuary and identified all the marine invertebrate species present, which recovered almost double the number of animal phyla than the traditional morphological analysis **\[2\]**. A study of samples from an insecticide spill in 2016 at the river Kennet demonstrated the high resolution of entire invertebrate communities before and after the spill **\[3\]**. The EU COST Action DNAquaNet, a consortium of representatives of all EU countries, develops monitoring standards for European water bodies to complement existing morphotaxonomic approaches.  Similar work was achieved to survey soil arthropods **\[4\]** and bees **\[5\]**. The latter has now become a central part of the UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme \(PoMS\), conducted by UK\-CEH and funded by Defra, and turned into a key revenue stream for NatureMetrics carrying out Environmental Impact Assessments \(EIAs\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Impact on Commerce and the economy 

 The wider area of DNA taxonomy is the specialty of the Vogler & Savolainen labs. Method development for characterising eDNA either through direct sequencing from the water sample or complex specimen mixture was used for developing commercial products \(eDNA tests\), thanks to Research Council funding and the close collaboration with Thompson Ecology. Many laboratories have worked on these procedures, but Imperial has been particularly successful in transferring this expertise to the commercial sector. 

 **NatureMetrics Ltd** was co\-founded by Imperial staff \(Vogler, with postdoc Andujar, together with researchers at the University of East Anglia\) in 2015, initially as a consultancy through Imperial Consultants, with two grants from NERC, in addition to funding from UEA and ‘angel investors’. NatureMetrics currently employs \~30 members of staff \(18 PhDs, Jan. 2021\) and was established to implement the techniques developed at Imperial by the Vogler lab and offer them to the private and public sector on commercial terms **\[A\]**. For example, in the spring of 2018 the Great Crested Newt test was conducted on \~2500 samples for \~60 different clients, from private individuals to small and large ecological consultancies **\[A\]**. The company has traded for four years, is profitable, and has doubled revenue each year with a current annual turnover of £800k **\[A\]**. NM is increasingly involved in Environmental Impact Assessments \(EIAs\) conducted by extractive industries and has set up regional offices and partner laboratories in South America, Southeast Asia and Africa. A second funding round concluded in 2019 raised £2.5M at a Pre\-Money valuation of £5M **\[A\]**. 

 **Thomson Unicomarine**, the marine branch of the ecology consultancy company Thomson Ecology, worked with the Savolainen lab to assess the biodiversity in the Harwich Estuary. The work conducted in Harwich Estuary helped decipher the marine invertebrate community composition in more detail than the traditional morphology approach. eDNA extracted from mud samples from the shore in Harwich Estuary identified all the marine invertebrate species present. This analysis recovered almost double the number of animal phyla than the traditional morphological one; therefore monitoring programmes are being changed to include metabarcoding. Also commissioned by Thomson Ecology Ltd we use eDNA technology for monitoring the presence of Great Crested Newts, a protected species, which presence would preclude or delay large building works \(ca. 350 samples\) **\[B\]**. 

###  Impacts on the environment 

###  Covid19 

 Funded by College and an Urgency Grant from NERC, Savolainen and colleagues at Imperial are evaluating the potential for sewage \(via effluent discharge, storm overflows, and other forms of run\-off\) to contribute to transmission to humans and wildlife by assessing RNA concentration and viral infectivity from environmental samples, from sewage outflows down to rivers, estuaries, and faeces from wildlife. Using data on concentrations of SARS\-CoV\-2 RNA fragments in raw sewage as well as in the environment, the team also provides models from population\-level prevalence of SARS\-CoV\-2 to potential transmission routes. Savolainen has been joining fortnightly meetings chaired by Defra, and with representatives of UKRI, the Environmental Agency, the Government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre and Office for National Statistics, etc, to advise SARS\-Cov\-2 risks to the environment. This being translated into policies for disease surveillance; e.g. after Savolainen was asked to inform Defra’s Chief Scientist and Chief Vet about his findings of the presence of new, yet uncharacterised, coronaviruses in British bats **\[C, D\]**. 

###  Surveys of targeted species, including invasive and protected species 

 The decline in pollinating insects across the UK is of particular concern due to their critical importance in the ecosystem. Since 2017 the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology \(UKCEH\) has led the UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme \(PoMS\) which consists of 75 sites across Britain, using passive pan traps **\[E\]**. Each survey season this produces hundreds of thousands of specimens which need to be identified, a tedious and time\-consuming task requiring specialist expertise **\[E\]**. This has led to two challenges \(1\) species identifications can be imprecise \(2\) expertise is expensive and in short supply meaning monitoring is difficult, or costly to implement at a sufficient scale **\[E\]**. The DNA\-based methods described in \[6\] use deep sequencing of trap samples to identify bee species, which overcomes high error rates and inconsistencies in conventional taxonomical identifications and help solve the two above challenges of the monitoring scheme.  Furthermore, these analyses allow for the study of associated pollen DNA to determine the plant visited by an insect **\[E\]**. In partnership with the UKCEH they have secured £50,000 from Defra to further develop the metabarcoding which will allow the DNA methods to be fully integrated in the PoMS as its main route for specimen identification, thereby increasing the capacity of the scheme for monitoring and as evidence base for pollinator declines across the UK **\[E\]**. 

 Our work with the American signal crayfish showed that eDNA levels correlate with crayfish numbers in egg\-bearing females, meaning that population size can be estimated during the breeding season. This presents a great advantage in the management of this invasive species **\[F\]**. 

 With regard to protected species, both the European otter and the European water vole are protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.  This means that surveys are required before undertaking development projects that can alter their habitats. Currently traditional methods are used for such surveys based on looking for visual signs of their presence, including tracks, dens, dung, feeding remains, and live individuals. In collaboration with the National Trust, Mammal Society, Wildlife Trust, Somerset Otter Group, New Forest Wildlife Park, Cardiff University's Otter Project and the British Wildlife Centre, we developed eDNA tests for otters, mink \(which threaten native water voles\) and water voles that proved to be more efficient than traditional methods in detecting those species **\[G, H\]**. 

 As another example, the hazel dormouse, which is also protected, is traditionally surveyed using nest tubes. There is a risk of a false\-negative result if dormice visit a survey nest tube but do not build a nest and the method therefore takes several months to complete, which can significantly delay building developments and infrastructure projects **\[I\]**. In collaboration with the British Wildlife Centre and London Zoo ZSL, we developed an eDNA test to detect hazel dormice visits to nest tubes by amplifying DNA from urine, to reduce the false\-negative risk of the traditional survey method and hasten their detection. By having a robust test, it gives developers certainty and can mitigate possible delays **\[I\]**. Now, People's Trust for Endangered Species and Natural England have adopted this new method to measure abundance and/or offer population ecology of other species **\[I, J\]**.
