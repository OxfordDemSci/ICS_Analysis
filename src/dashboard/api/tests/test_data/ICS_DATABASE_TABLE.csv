###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Highly innovative research at RGU, centred around low\-energy buildings, has led to significant impacts relating to both new buildings and retro\-fitting of older properties. These have resulted in positive outcomes such as the opening of new markets, improvements in turnover and reduction in energy consumption. 

 The research has also enabled the mass\-market housing industry to re\-evaluate its technologies and processes and adopt PassivHaus standards \(PH\) – a low\-energy building standard. This has resulted in the achievement of significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in skills, knowledge and building processes, lower energy consumption and futureproofing of housing stock. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research led by Professor Deveci and Dr Bennadji has involved work undertaken through collaboration with external partners, including housing developers \(Dandara\), property owners and providers of specialist technical processes and methods \(Kishorn, Icynene\) to improve environmental performance and expert advice \(CSIC\). 

 Key underpinning research undertaken has included: 

-  **Demonstrating ‘Passivhaus’ standards for the Scottish volume housing market** \(2017\-19\), Construction Scotland Innovation Centre with Dandara Ltd. \(£147,259 including £54,305 grant to RGU\) 

-  **The Truss House** \(Integra\)\- Affordable Housing Typologies \(2017\-18\) Construction Scotland Innovation Centre with Sylvan Stuart Ltd \(£98,582 including £49,833 grant to RGU\) 

-  **Internal wall insulation** \(2019\) Energy Technology Partnership with Novus Elements Ltd 

-  **Testing a method to insulate buildings with lathe / plaster inner wall of external double wall** \(2011\) Construction Scotland Innovation Centre with Kishorn Insulations 

-  **Design optimisation and prototyping for affordable rural housing: digitisation, automation and robotics options for the Integra House** \(2020\) Transforming Construction EPSRC Transforming Network Plus \(Grant to RGU £53,869\) 

 The underpinning research was mainly undertaken using applied and practice\-led methods and utilised innovative design processes and retrofitting solutions that would have significant impact on climate mitigation and economic growth. The research provided insights and original findings regarding ‘Passivhaus’ standards \(PH\) in the context of mass market housing, the adoption of low carbon standards in volume housing development and the challenges of adapting historic buildings to meet climate change targets. 

 Research tested the hypothesis that the PH can be applied to provide high\-quality housing in the mass market, at a competitive cost while still utilising the local Scottish supply chain. The research team worked with Dandara to remodel two existing house types: one to German PH standards while the other used Scottish supply chains where possible. Both house types were successfully completed to PH standards, clearly demonstrating that design and construction skills are available in Scotland, and that this project could act as a model for other volume housebuilders. 

 Underpinning research within the theme also involved study of the impact of retrofitting older buildings to improve energy performance, where many of these were not originally designed and constructed to accommodate modern insulation materials. This research included studies which concentrate on the development of new materials, processes that support their incorporation, and the effects on lifecycle and performance. 

 The applied research tested the barriers to, and challenges for, the adoption of Low/Zero\-carbon construction standards within the volume house building industry, including capital cost, valuation, skill shortages, supply chain issues and changing the behaviours of building occupiers. 

 An important area of focus addressed reasons for resistance, or barriers to change, among volume house builders, as they are collectively responsible for construction of 90% of the UK’s new houses. The research examined potential consequences of incomplete knowledge and a perception among housing developers that ‘it is too much change’. It also concerned the perception within the industry that the additional capital costs involved could not be easily passed on to purchasers as the accumulated value of this style of housing is poorly understood and communicated.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research undertaken by the group has had a demonstrable impact in a number of areas, where the type of impact can be clearly identified and supported by evidence. There is also a clear causal connection between the underpinning research and the areas of impact. 

 **Impacts on production** 

 Dandara is one of the biggest volume housebuilders in the UK and work referenced in this case study has led to fundamental changes for the organisation. It is enabling the mass house building industry, including its supply chain, to re\-evaluate its technology and processes. The application of the research findings has had considerable benefits including improved processes, technology, skills and knowledge, significant performance improvements leading to the achievement of sizeable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, lower energy bills for home residents and more comfortable homes. \[1\] 

 Work undertaken and led by Deveci has been cited nationally as an exemplar of off\-site housing manufacture, and for their low\-energy consumption and approach to procurement. \[2\] and \[3\] 

 **Impacts on practitioners and delivery of professional services, enhanced performance or ethical practice** 

 This research has also facilitated a deeper understanding of the performance of Passivhaus Homes in Scotland across industry, including housing associations. This understanding is vital to embedding widespread application of PH in the mass market volume housing sector. It will also enable Scotland to meet its CO<sub>2</sub> reduction targets in 2030 and address the performance Gap. 

 The completed research set out a clear process for evaluating and highlighting what was required to achieve PH, ultimately leading to adoption of the standard by volume housebuilders which has gone on to have a clear economic impact within the mass market.   The impact is clearly evidenced by Dandara homes adding a **new product** \[4\] on to their housing types, implementing changes in their standard heating, ventilation and airtightness levels, altering their supply chain, developing site management and training their staff to further develop their skills. Taken together these actions have resulted in significant improvements in **energy use** and **emissions**. \[1\] 

 **Impact on knowledge and perception** 

 The research has demonstrated that PH and low\-energy approaches are not only a very environmentally friendly way to build housing, but also financially viable for volume housing. The outcome from the research generated valuable data and lessons, which could be utilised by other mass housing suppliers, designers, providers and developers which, in turn, can make a significant contribution towards meeting the Scottish national targets for net zero. \[5\] 

 **Impacts on commerce and the economy** 

 The research concerning the retro\-fitting of older properties was undertaken in direct collaboration with industry partners Kishorn Insulations. The studies undertaken \(led by Bennadji\) have had a significant increase in the contracts won by Kishorn Insulations, with contracts rising from 43 in 2015 to over 110 per annum in the years 2018 to 2020. This rise in contracts is a direct result of the collaborative research and represents a significant financial impact for the industry partner, aside from the environmental impact of the project itself. \[6\] \[7\] \[8\] 

 **Impacts on the environment** 

 Work undertaken by Bennadji studied the application of novel materials to achieve energy performance improvements in existing stone houses. Over a period of 18 months, energy use \(for heating\) reduced by 56%, which represents an immediate and positive impact on the environment. \[8\] \[9\] 

 Furthermore, large scale public debate and associated events organised by the submitting researchers in collaboration with external partners represented a significant pathway to impact. These included a significant event with the Pebble Trust, a Scottish charity supporting a more sustainable, equal and low\-carbon society, and which attracted an audience of over 150 people. The events made it possible to impact on a wider understanding of how buildings can be modified and retrofitted to have a lower environmental impact, and how building owners and occupiers can be supported to undertake such work. \[10\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Da Rold’s research on medieval handwritten culture, the close examination of medieval manuscripts, and in particular on the use of paper in book production, has contributed to the design and delivery of two MOOCs \(Massive Open On\-line Course\). The ‘community enrichment’ value of this dissemination is evinced by the range of beneficiaries it reached, including teachers, curators and librarians, calligraphers, retired people, families taking the course together, and postgraduate students. It influenced professional practices, provided access to traditionally unattainable training, and enhanced the well\-being of private individuals who were able to pursue their interests. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Da Rold’s research pioneers new ways of looking at manuscripts and materiality. It questions established methods and opens up new ways of thinking about codicology \(the study of the book as a whole\) and palaeography \(the study of medieval handwriting\), especially in relation to the dating and production of medieval books. It also puts book history in its social and cultural context as part of a wider holistic framework for the study of medieval literature. Da Rold’s research employs a variety of methodologies, some looking broadly across European traditions, others presenting case studies within individual national and local milieus. For example, ‘Codicology, Localization and Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS. Laud. Misc. 108’ studies the social and cultural context of the circulation and transmission of one manuscript to inform a discussion of local production practices **\[R1\]**, while ‘Medieval Manuscript Studies: a European Perspective’, a collaboration with Marilena Maniaci, looks at broader geographical trends and scribal practices **\[R2\]**. Da Rold has contributed to the field of Digital Humanities by applying computing methodologies to the study of medieval manuscripts **\[R3\]**. 

 These research interests culminated in the recent publication of *Paper in Medieval England: From Pulp to Fictions* \(2020\). This book provides a detailed analysis of the coming of paper to medieval England, and its influence on the literary and non\-literary culture of the period. Looking beyond book production, Da Rold maps out the uses of paper and explains the success of this technology in medieval culture, considering how people interacted with it and how it affected their lives. In this book, Da Rold discusses how the medieval book changed and renewed both diachronically and synchronically across countries, regions and local production milieus. The close examination of medieval manuscripts, and in particular of the use of medieval paper in culture and society, has shown the cultural significance of the medieval book as witness of the past, as portent for future models of knowledge, and as key to how handwritten culture connected transnational communities and enabled social mobility. This research demonstrates how a painstaking analysis of medieval materiality yields new information on the construction of medieval books, informing our knowledge of how texts were transmitted and circulated, and giving us a broader picture of pre\-modern communication practices **\[R4\]**. The research was funded by a British Academy Mid\-Career Fellowship \(2017\). 

 The nature of Da Rold’s research is often collaborative, and a recent joint publication with Professor Elaine Treharne \(Stanford University\) argues for the initiation of a broader international interest in the production of medieval English manuscripts from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries, and the enhancement of pedagogical practices in manuscript studies across different periods, languages and specialisms **\[R5** and **R6\]**. This collaboration and its aims have partly been fulfilled in the two ‘Digging Deeper’ MOOCs, which engaged a wider public, including professionals in a range of fields, in a richer understanding of medieval manuscript culture.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The growing number of online digital images from medieval manuscripts inspired Da Rold and Treharne to design an accessible MOOC bringing their research on the materiality of the medieval book to diverse beneficiaries. In 2014, Da Rold joined in the creation of a two\-part course led by Treharne in collaboration with two rare book librarians: Dr Suzanne Paul \(Cambridge\) and Dr Ben Albritton \(Stanford\). The course also involved binding specialists and curators from their Special Collections teams. Da Rold contributed to designing the syllabi, including learning outcomes, the bibliography and the selection of the manuscripts for filming. She then contributed video tutorials in her particular field, on paper, codicology and the significance of the codex. Digging Deeper 1: Making Manuscripts \(January\-March 2015; DD1\) and Digging Deeper 2: The Form and Function of Manuscripts \(April\-May 2015; DD2\) were then the first freely available cross\-sector online resources covering this material. 

 \[Text removed for publication\]. In June 2015, following the period of active certification for both courses, the course completion rate for DD1 was 22%, and for DD2 was 26%, which is well above the average MOOC completion rate of 2\-10% **\[E1\]**. In the first week of January 2020, 47 active learners were recorded, representing ongoing engagement with the material beyond the period of active delivery of the courses **\[E1\]**. Learners enrolled from 124 different countries \(including Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Morocco, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Ukraine, Vietnam, and the Holy See\) **\[E1\]**. Two follow\-up workshops were organised in Cambridge by Paul at the University Library, of which one was run by Da Rold in 2015. 48 MOOC participants responded to the invitation and 20 were able to attend the workshop **\[E2\]**. 

 The learning resource and the workshops engaged individuals in the heritage sector, informed the professional practices of teachers and education specialists in the delivery of services and teaching, and inspired members of the public to engage with these otherwise inaccessible texts and research outputs. 

 **Impacts on understanding, well\-being and access** 

 DD1 and DD2 enabled access to university\-level teaching to those without opportunities to learn about manuscripts due to personal circumstances, or lack of access. ‘There is nothing of this sort where I live in rural Northern California’ **\[E3\]** \(p 10\), one learner explained, and another noted: ‘\[My\] health makes travel difficult. That is one of the reasons why I appreciated your class so much.’ **\[E2\]** 

 The MOOC has been described by a user as a ‘community enrichment course’ **\[E4\]**. A retired participant tells us: ‘As a retiree Medieval MSS got me in its grips \[…\] plus \[I\] put together a couple of superficial lectures on same – presumptive but at seniors’ residences it’s the images as much as the content that is successful’ **\[E2\]**. Beneficiaries talk about how ‘This course has opened my eyes to the depth and complexity of the creation of the manuscripts themselves’ **\[E3\]** \(p 9\) and proudly state ‘The biggest surprise to me was how gratifying it was to struggle through the paleography exercises’ **\[E3\]** \(p 9\). Multiple participants noted it enhanced their experiences of viewing manuscripts in museums **\[E2, E3\]**. A newsletter item from the Guild of Book Workers emphasises that this ‘form of education allows students from all over the world to participate in classes that would not otherwise be accessible to them’ **\[E5\]** \(p 10\). A calligrapher noted ‘I have been practising calligraphy for a number of years now, so I am attracted to the subject, and my expectations were exceeded’ **\[E3\]** \(p 21\). 

 **Impacts on practitioners and delivery of professional services** 

 DD1 and DD2 helped teachers and education specialists to ‘get ideas for how to approach teaching the material in a classroom’ **\[E6\]**. The MOOC also assisted with these learners’ own professional development: ‘it also helped me fill in gaps in my own knowledge’ \[E6\], as well as offering an opportunity for academics to reflect the benefits of digital pedagogy in higher education – one taken, for example, by a UK lecturer in their work for a professional qualification **\[E7\]**. 

 Heritage professionals who undertook the course reported that it developed both professional practice and personal interest: ‘Despite having spent a long part of my professional life working with historical documents, the course has awakened my interest in some details of the making of manuscripts that had gone unnoticed to me’ **\[E3\]** \(p 5\). It was consistently noted that it was the combination of palaeography and technical / structural detail \(Da Rold’s special expertise\) that made the course so valuable **\[E2, E3\]**. A review by a curator, published by the International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Work, recognized the importance of the project in encouraging other conservators to ‘keep an eye on online learning initiatives such as this one \[…\] The course offered me the opportunity to learn specialist vocabulary used by manuscript historians, and \[…\] acquire some knowledge about Palaeography, a subject I overlooked in the past’ **\[E8\]**. 

 Professionals from Anglesey Abbey \(National Trust\) worked in groups through the course, and five years later a conservator reflected on the value of the MOOC: ‘For myself, it allowed me to develop my understanding and my skills; I was able to transfer, for example, the palaeographic skills directly into my job working with primary sources. \[...\] It has already stood me in better stead for job applications and interviews. I know that one colleague who undertook the course at the same as me has used it as a starting point for developing a career in book conservation’ **\[E9\]**. She further noted that this learning influenced internal working practices: ‘We were able to pass on our understanding to our colleagues \[...\] and use it in training volunteer book cleaners’ **\[E9\]**. A Special Collections Librarian at the University of Lincoln, seconded to Lincoln Cathedral, writes: ‘The information supplied through the MOOC hugely enhanced my knowledge and confidence in dealing with the Cathedral’s manuscript collection \[…\] I have been able to implement these skills in my career and used the MOOC as a training tool for students and users of the Cathedral collection and in creating displays within the University Library’ **\[E10\]**. A Medical Librarian working at Aga Khan University, Karachi explains: ‘I \[…\] am confident that this course will help me appreciate the problems faced in matters of conservation and digitization in a developing country’s context’ **\[E2\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Queen Mary’s Prof. Pasi has revolutionised treatment for haemophilia and also made it more accessible, while offering a potential cure for the condition. Pasi’s group has led clinical development programmes for new treatments that reduce the number of clotting factor infusions required to manage the disease. Typically, infusions are frequent and burdensome for both patients and healthcare systems, while also being either impractical or inaccessible for 75% of the global population of haemophiliacs. Pasi’s novel therapies reduce the need for infusions by up to one\-third in haemophilia A and half in haemophilia B. These therapies have been approved and licensed globally since 2014, and have been recommended in UK guidelines since 2016. Pasi has also developed a clinical programme for a gene therapy for severe haemophilia A, which received European Medical Agency approval in 2016. Pasi’s developments overcome the problem of accessibility of treatment at a global level, and help directly alleviate the suffering and burden experienced by patients with severe forms of the disease.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Haemophilia is a rare blood disease that affects about 7 in 100,000 people \(around 36,000 people in Europe, mostly men\). The condition is caused by defects in genes associated with coagulation and exists in two types: Haemophilia A \(caused by a defect in the production of coagulation factor VIII\) and Haemophilia B \(caused by a far less common defect in the production of factor IX\). 

 Treating severe haemophilia currently involves regular infusions of clotting factor concentrate, given every alternate day for haemophilia A and at least twice a week for haemophilia B. Although this treatment is regarded as state\-of\-the\-art, it does not completely eliminate bleeding risk and is a significant treatment burden for men with severe haemophilia. Moreover, most \(75%\) of the world’s haemophiliac population cannot access treatment— and, even if they did, in many places, the therapies would be entirely impracticable due to the demanding nature of the treatment regime. Therefore, there is a need for therapies that are less invasive — such as less frequent infusions, or one\-off approaches such as gene therapy — to enable simpler, less burdensome treatment options for patients globally. 

#  Development of bioengineered coagulation factor proteins VIII and IX 

 Coagulation factor proteins can now be bioengineered with a potentially prolonged half\-life, which would mean less frequent treatments for patients. Pasi worked on previous clinical trials to develop the first factor IX proteins in the 1990s. Thus, due to this expertise and experience, Pasi co\-led a more recent multi\-centre global programme to develop Fc fusion proteins for coagulation factors VIII and IX. The new clinical trials — conducted in collaboration with Jerry Powell at the University of California, Davis and sponsored by Biogen Inc. — began in 2010 and became the world’s largest phase 3 programmes in haemophilia \[3.1, 3.2\]. The trials led to a change in treatment regime for patients with the disease, reducing the numbers of infusions required by one\-third in haemophilia A patients and half in haemophilia B patients, thereby helping alleviate the issues of treatment burden and accessibility. 

#  Development of gene addition therapy using AAV5\-FVIII 

 Gene therapies hold great potential in treating various conditions. Pasi worked with BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. to develop a clinical research programme for severe haemophilia A, a gene addition technology using the vector AAV5\-FVIII \(adeno\-associated virus serotype 5 \(AAV5\) encoding a B\-domain\-deleted human factor VIII\). After being given once to the patient via an injection into a vein, the virus carries the factor VIII gene into the liver cells, enabling them to produce the missing factor VIII. The adeno\-associated virus does not cause disease in humans. The programme had outstanding results \[3.3, 3.4\]: factor VIII levels normalised in 11 of 13 patients treated at therapeutic dose, with all patients coming off factor replacement therapy. This work offers the real prospect of a ‘cure’ for severe haemophilia, especially given that further follow\-up data has shown continued effectiveness after three years \[3.5\].

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research by Queen Mary’s Prof. Pasi has provided evidence of the clinical efficacy and safety of novel, cutting\-edge therapies for treating haemophilia. This has resulted in life\-changing new treatments being brought to market. Based on Pasi’s findings, UK guidelines for treatment of haemophilia have been updated to recommend the use of these therapies in routine clinical practice, in turn providing better care, prognosis, and quality of life to patients \(and families\) who would typically be debilitated by the condition. 

#  Uptake of the new therapies into clinical guidelines and practice 

 The clinical trials and multi\-centre global studies led by Pasi demonstrate that the newly developed coagulation factor proteins for factor VIII and factor IX are safe and effective, and also offered evidence of the efficacy of AAV5\-FVIII gene therapy \(across phase 1/2 programmes and first part of phase 3 studies\). This work directly enabled \[5.1\-5.5\]: 



 Prof. David Lillicrap from the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine at Queen’s University, Canada said “to prevent spontaneous episodes of bleeding, patients with severe haemophilia have had to inject their substitution clotting factor 2\-3 times each week to maintain protective levels of the missing protein. Thus, although this treatment is safe and effective the quality of life of these patients left a lot to be desired” \[5.6\]. However, Eloctate and Alprolix make it possible to *“*reduce the number of infusions while the bleeding rate remains comparable with that of more frequent infusions with classic FVIII and FIX products. This improves the adherence and quality of life for patients, and for children who have difficult venous access it might reduce the need for intravenous catheters during the first years of life,” according to the Director of the PedNet Haemophilia Research Foundation, Dr. H. Marijke van den Berg \[5.7\]. 

 In 2016, Pasi also helped shape the UK’s Haemophilia Centres’ Doctors’ Organisation national guidelines, which now recommend the use of these therapies in routine clinical practice \[5.8\]. 

#  Improving patients’ lives 

 By making extended half\-life therapies available on a wider scale, Pasi has helped reduce the numbers of infusions required by patients to manage their condition by one\-third in haemophilia A and half in haemophilia B. 

 For patient Jack \[5.9\], bleeding centred around his ankles would usually mean two or three days of rest, treatment and recuperation. His health was particularly worrisome for his family and girlfriend, and he was already being treated for arthritis as a result of repeated ankle bleeds. However, since starting on AAV5\-FVIII treatment Jack has not needed any treatment for bleeding, saying “The treatment has given my family, friends and girlfriend the freedom not to worry. It’s a massive change for them because they know I’m protected now.” 

 Another patient, Darren, was also suffering from co\-morbidities related to haemophilia bleeds — namely arthritis and damage in some joints. “It was such a relief to know \[these\] wouldn’t continue to get worse,” says Darren, going on to state that “the treatment has changed my life considerably.” Within a few days of starting the AAV5\-FVIII treatment, Darren’s coagulation factor levels had already increased. “I started noticing that minor knocks weren’t bruising like they used to,” he said. Darren gives an example of the improvement of his quality of life: “Just a week after treatment, I was at work when a child accidently rammed me with a shopping trolley. I thought ‘oh no, that’s really going to be bad’, and I was prepared for a bad ankle bleed. But instead of needing four days of bed rest it healed within 24 hours. I couldn’t believe it. It’s brilliant not having to worry all the time whether I might bump or scratch myself. There’s no more need to panic.” Darren’s factor VIII levels continued to rise and a month later, his readings were up to 90% of normal levels \[5.10\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 **Ocean Liners: Speed and Style** was an international interdisciplinary research project, major touring exhibition \(seen by 411,600 people\), publication \(16,503 copies sold\), and learning and engagement programme \(reaching 13,958 individuals\). Devised as the inaugural exhibition for the major regeneration initiative, V&A Dundee, the project used a subject matter – shipbuilding – with strong national and regional associations to introduce new audiences to the context of design and the museum environment. The exhibition created new knowledge exchange networks between researchers, museums, shipping heritage archives, and contemporary cruise companies. This engagement has led to: advocacy for further support for ocean liner material culture preservation; new collections, significant donations, and the protection and display of ocean liner material culture. The exhibition received significant international, national, and regional media coverage and influenced approaches to market development and increasing commercial competition in the USD40,000,000,000 a year \(pre\-Covid\) contemporary cruise industry, through the promotion of quality design on board cruise ships. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 *Ocean Liners: Speed & Style* \( **3.1**\) was co\-curated by Ghislaine Wood, Sainsbury Centre, UEA and Dan Finamore, Peabody Essex Museum \(PEM\), Salem, Mass., USA and the exhibitions took place between 2017 and 2019. The project aimed, for the first time, to survey and publicly display the surviving art and design culture of the ocean liner industry, which is dispersed internationally in public and private collections. The research located and identified previously inaccessible material worldwide and employed an interdisciplinary group of academics from a number of international institutions to research the material culture of the ocean liner. Importantly, the project used the lens of the ocean liner to explore major historical themes including: the servicing of Empire; the rise of nationalism in Europe; mass migration in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries; shipbuilding and the industrial economy; liners as tools of state and war; design and style as drivers of commerce and competition. The project researched the personal histories of passengers, and the roles of fashion and ritual on board. 

 The Ocean Liners project is built on Wood’s extensive body of work on inter\- and post\-war art and design including the co\-curation of the landmark V&A *Art Deco* exhibition \(2003\), which explored the interdisciplinary nature and global impact of Art Deco and received international recognition for its innovative approach, touring to Toronto, San Francisco, Boston, Tokyo, Osaka, and Melbourne. The co\-curation of the major V&A Olympic\-year exhibition *British Design 1948\-2012: Innovation in the Modern Age* \(2012\) which is the most extensive survey of British design to date and, amongst other themes, explored the tensions between tradition and modernity in post\-war art, architecture, and design. The Ocean Liners project continues these exhibitions’ legacies, along with building upon research that informed *‘Floating Museums: Ocean Liners and Art Deco’* \( **3.3**\). The project brought together art, design, fashion, architecture, and economic and maritime histories with historians of technology to explore the impact of the liner across a range of social, political, and economic contexts. It particularly focussed on how the design of liners, and the art commissioned for them, drove competition and profitability within the industry. The project aimed to use historical ocean liner design to engage with the contemporary cruise industry, the fastest growing sector of the leisure industry pre\-Covid, to explore contemporary design and visitor experience. A major publication was produced, *Ocean Liners* \( **3.2**\), and a wide\-ranging public engagement programme accompanied the exhibition in all three venues. The exhibition \( **3.1**\) opened at the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Mass., USA \( **May − Aug 2017\)** and then travelled to London, V&A **\(Feb − Jun 2018\)** before becoming the inaugural exhibition for V&A Dundee **\(Sep 2018 − May 2019\)**.

 4. Details of the impact 

 *Ocean Liners: Speed & Style* \( **3.1**\) was a major exhibition, which travelled to three international institutions and was seen by 411,600 people \(142,751 V&A Kensington, 157,449 V&A Dundee, and 111,400 Peabody Essex Museum, USA\). It was accompanied by the illustrated publication *Ocean Liners* \(16,503 copies sold\) \( **3.2**\), edited by Dan Finamore and Ghislaine Wood. A wide\-ranging learning and engagement programme supported the exhibition in all three venues including conferences, talks, short courses, workshops, performances, evening events, practical workshops and digital events for children, with the V&A Dundee and London events combined reaching 13,958 individuals. An extensive social media campaign also supported the show and V&A Dundee achieved over 551,865 impressions for social media advertising **\(5.2** p.11 **\)**. 

1.  **Building new audiences, engaging with design culture, and supporting regeneration in Dundee** 

 The *Ocean Liners: Speed & Style* exhibition was devised to open the V&A Museum of Design, Dundee, a GBP80,000,000 regeneration project, which transformed the waterfront, providing a new museum for the city. Wood was the lead V&A curator for V&A Dundee \(before joining UEA\), and originated the *Ocean Liners* exhibition while curating the Scottish Design Gallery, which also opened the museum. The V&A Dundee National Lottery Heritage Fund Final Evaluation Report **\(5.3** p.37 **\)** describes how ‘ *Ocean Liners was agreed to be the most appropriate opening exhibition \[for V&A Dundee\] as it covers a wealth of design disciplines as well as placing Scottish engineering at the heart of the exhibition*’ *.* The report goes on to highlight how the museum’s Exhibitions Programme, which *Ocean Liners* was selected to open *,* was ‘ *… developed to fulfil the museum’s mission of enriching lives through design and deliver on its vision to inspire people and promote a greater understanding of design, including reaching wider and diverse audiences*’. 

 The 157,449 visitors to *Ocean Liners* at V&A Dundee represented 33% of museum footfall over the exhibition period and the \[\* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \* redacted text \*\] and the *Ocean Liners* catalogue was the top\-selling item for the museum during the exhibition run \( **5.2** p.2\). 

 Visitor feedback from the Dundee exhibition \( **5.2** p.2&4\) was extremely positive, and demonstrated that expectations were often exceeded with comments including; ‘ *I wasn’t interested before coming but left fascinated and inspired*’, ‘ *Didn’t expect anything this good in Dundee*’ and ‘ *Fantastic exhibition. Much bigger than expected*’. Other visitors reflected on how it ‘ *Felt as if you were there – design was so absorbing*’ and being ‘ *…transported to a different era*’. Of the 2,910 visitor surveys completed ‘ *74% of respondents sa\[id\] they had learnt something new as a result of the visit …* *92% of respondents rated the overall exhibition experience positively*’ *.* Underlying these statistics, the impact on individual visitors in the exhibition was personal and profound as one V&A Dundee Visitor Assistant describes in the V&A Dundee National Lottery funding report, discussing his highlights as ‘ *seeing visitors to Ocean Liners dancing around to the music played in the exhibition and reminiscing about their own sea voyages*’ \( **5.3** p.112\). 

 The exhibition was of great cultural and social significance for those who were part of the history of shipbuilding and engaged these audiences with the new museum in Dundee. A *Daily Record* article, *Clyde shipbuilders head back in time for Ocean Liners exhibition at V&A museum,* at the time of the exhibition reported that: 

 ‘*Ronnie McLellan, 75, and Peggy, 74, his wife of 50 years, have tears in their eyes as they recall being passengers on the QE2 in 1993. Ronnie said: “When we were young, I promised we would sail on her one day … \[it\] felt like we had made it when we actually did ... I took her hand and showed her all the bits I had done. It was very emotional… I am proud to have helped build such a beautiful ship”*’ \( **5.1**\) *.* 

 As the opening exhibition at V&A Dundee, *Ocean Liners* had wide economic significance. For many visitors to the exhibition, *Ocean Liners* was their main reason for visiting the city of Dundee. The visitor survey report highlighted that ‘ *77% of respondents said Ocean Liners was their sole or main reason to visit Dundee, demonstrating the importance of exhibitions to the overall destination’* \( **5.2** p.4 *\)*. *Ocean Liners* brought visitors from the local area \(51%\), across Scotland \(39%\), and the exhibition’s presence at V&A Dundee coincided with a 19.4% increase in visitors to Dundee during the first six months of 2019. Visitors to the museum as a whole were found to be worth GBP21,000,000 to the Dundee economy and GBP75,000,000 to the overall Scottish economy in the 12 months from 15 September 2018 \( **5.5**\). Citing its tremendous economic impact, Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: 

 ‘*V&A Dundee is a powerful symbol of Dundee’s new confidence and the strong future of design and innovation across our nation … In its first year it has far exceeded expectations for visitor numbers and proved an incredible success in boosting Scotland’s attractiveness to those looking for world\-class cultural experiences*’ \( **5.8** p.2\). 

1.  **Establishing knowledge exchange networks and enabling preservation of material culture, developing new collections, and creation of new exhibition environments** 

 The project highlighted the importance of historic ocean liner collections and enabled individuals in disparate archives, museums, and companies to connect. As V&A Dundee director Philip Long highlighted in *The Courier* \( **5.1**\) ‘ *Many of these objects have not been seen in Europe since the ships were launched. It is a fantastic opportunity to find out about some of the greatest design of the 20th century*’ *.* A key part of the project advocated for further support for the preservation of ocean liner material culture by highlighting the on\-going influence historic liners have on various sectors including architecture, film, and the contemporary cruise industry. The project revealed the value of archive assets to companies holding historic archives and how they can be used to promote prestige and raise profile. The team worked closely with P&O Heritage Archive \(owned by Dubai Port\), French Lines, Costa, Viking Cruises, and Cunard amongst others. 

 The exhibition prompted contributing organisations to take the opportunity to develop their own collections. \[\*redacted\*\], Senior Curator, P&O Heritage \( **5.4** p.4\) describes how ‘ *As a direct result of reviewing our liner tableware, with V&A & PEM, we then collaborated with V&A & Wedgwood jointly acquiring \(by donation\) a near complete set of Oriana China \(designed by Robert Y Gooden\)*’ *.* This is a lasting legacy of *Ocean Liners* both as a key and rare opportunity for these private collections to be appreciated by the public in world\-renowned museums and for them to ‘ *reviv\[e\] a sense of corporate pride in \[the\] collection internally*’ at P&O, as well as acting as a catalyst for these collections to grow \( **5.4** p.1\). Building upon this relationship, Wood and the Sainsbury Centre, UEA are working with P&O Heritage on research that will lead to a major new exhibition and publication exploring the archive of Sir Colin Anderson, Director of the British Orient Line and his impact on modern British design. This project will further explore the role that ships played in promoting ideas of modern art, design, and lifestyle. 

 For Peabody Essex Museum, the exhibition has led to a significant donation to their collection. Maritime Curator, \[\* redacted \*\] \( **5.6**\) detailed how ‘ *the exhibition allowed us to extend our involvement with maritime scholars and collectors beyond our traditional circle of 18th and 19th century interests, and connect with a significant circle of 20th century decorative arts collectors*’ and this ‘ *led to several offers of significant collections to the museum and library*’ *.* The most important of these is a donation of over 250 works from ‘ *the most prominent American collector of graphic and decorative arts related to ocean liner advertising and design*’. Furthermore, the PEM ‘ *library has also acquired a collection of travel scrapbooks and printed ephemera totalling about 100 pieces*’ *.* 

 The V&A *Ocean Liners* exhibition provided a key curatorial model for creating an exhibition environment integrating art, design, and architecture of historical ocean liners. For example, as part of the repurposing of the *Queen Mary* liner, which now operates as a hotel complex and entertainment destination in Long Beach, CA. Future plans include a Queen Mary Arts Centre and as a result of the exhibition Wood and Finamore are acting in an advisory capacity to the project \(which is currently delayed due to Covid\-19\). 

1.  **Informing approaches to market development and increasing commercial competition in the contemporary cruise industry** 

 Viking Cruises supported the exhibition with corporate sponsorship of over GBP300,000 and encouraged audiences on their cruises to engage with the content of the exhibition through various channels. Viking stated: 

 ‘*Working with the V&A on Ocean Liners: Speed & Style, was a great partnership for Viking. It allowed us share the exhibition with our audience, and for them to explore how ocean travel has evolved from its conception, into the contemporary, industry\-leading experience that Viking offer today*’ \( **5.9**\). 

 Viking reached an audience of more than 200,000 both on board their ships and through their various marketing platforms including their *Explorer Society News* magazine \(print circulation 50,000\) and database \(100,000\). The *Ocean Liners* book continues to be available on all Viking ocean ships reaching many thousands of passengers. Pre\-Covid the cruise industry was worth USD40,000,000,000 a year and was the fastest growing area of the leisure industries worldwide. The project aimed to inform the contemporary cruise industry on how design culture employed on ships historically drove competitive edge. Viking utilized this narrative to promote the quality of and engagement with their ships. Viking hosted a number of events for passengers at the exhibition. Viking past guest, \[\*  redacted  \*\], commented: 

 ‘*I was intrigued when I heard from Viking Cruises, that they were sponsoring the V&A’s glorious Ocean Liners Speed and Style. Having travelled with Viking a number of times and judging by the awards they have won, I could see that they are the natural successors to the storied cruise lines of the past*’ \( **5.9**\). 

 Viking continue to work with Wood, reaching mass audiences on their digital streaming platform, Viking TV, with their project Museum Monday. 

 Conference and workshops in London and Boston brought together academics, contemporary cruise ship designers, and industry experts to discuss the quality of contemporary versus historical design. Interior designer Kelly Hoppen, currently working for Carnival Cruises, spoke at the V&A with \[\*  redacted  \*\] the Cunard maritime architect of the *QM2*; while Scott Wilson of Butler Wilson, designer of the largest Royal Caribbean cruise ships in the world, spoke at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem. The cruise industries’ engagement with the exhibition was considerable with designer of the *QM2* \[\*redacted text\*\] commenting, ‘ *Interior designers from both the maritime and terra firma varieties, found much of interest and relevance to their projects of today*’ \( **5.10**\). 

1.  **Public and media attention for **Ocean Liners: Speed & Style** 

 *Ocean Liners* featured on Front Row Late \(BBC 2\), Sky News, Free Thinking \(BBC Radio 3\),  [<ins>Front Row</ins>](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09pjght) \(BBC Radio 4\), and popular daytime television programme Sunday Brunch \(Channel 4\) with approximately 688,000 viewers. The project research underpinned the Channel 5 TV documentary QE2: The World’s Greatest Cruise Ship which aired in Feb 2018, receiving around 3,060,000 viewers for the two episodes. The exhibition had exceptional online engagement across various platforms: the total number of V&A online page views for *Ocean Liners* from set up to the present is 754,523. 

 The exhibition was also reviewed extensively in the international, national, and regional press \( **5.1**\) including *The Wall Street Journal*, USA, *Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata*, Italy, alongside publications such as *frieze* and *The Art Newspaper*. Alastair Sooke, writing in *The Daily Telegraph* described the innovative nature of the exhibition as ‘ *The first show ever devoted to the design of ocean liners … full of fascinating moments and animated throughout by a breezy, buoyant spirit*’. In *The Scotsman*, Duncan Macmillan elegantly summarised the historical and social context of *Ocean Liners* and the exhibition’s role in setting the tone and ambition for future exhibitions at the newly opened V&A Dundee when he wrote: 

 ‘*There will be other partners in future shows, but if this \[Ocean Liners\] is how the new museum intends to carry on, it is a fittingly ambitious beginning … Here are the clothes they wore, ship models, art works and furniture from the fabulously luxurious interiors, film of life on board and much more to inform, intrigue and delight \- and that surely is what a museum should always do*’.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Oxford researchers developed a unique electronic \(paperless\) process for blood ordering, blood sample collection from patients, and issuing of blood in hospital laboratories and distribution to patients for transfusion. This has improved patient safety by reducing the number of wrong transfusion events, resulted in more timely availability of blood for urgent transfusions, and saved money through efficiencies in staff time and appropriate blood use. The first hospital\-wide implementation in Oxford hospitals resulted in a 26% reduction in blood costs \(more than GBP1,000,000 per year\) over the period 2013\-2019. These electronic processes are now marketed worldwide by *Haemonetics* \(Boston\) and have been implemented in 435 hospitals in the NHS and worldwide. The research resulted in changes to national guidelines including NICE, clinical specialty and UK Blood Transfusion Services and produced specifications for the electronic transfusion process for the National Patient Safety Agency, and the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Researchers at the University of Oxford developed and implemented a unique end\-to\-end electronic \(paperless\) transfusion process to improve the safety and efficiency of hospital transfusion. The process utilises barcoded patient wristbands, bedside handheld computers, electronically controlled blood fridges and is fully integrated with hospital laboratory information management systems. 

 Incorrect blood component transfusion is one of the most frequent serious transfusion incidents and errors responsible for these incidents frequently involve patient misidentiﬁcation. University of Oxford researchers investigated the role of barcode technology in increasing the safety of blood transfusion in non\-acute haematology settings finding that signiﬁcant improvements were made in the correct blood sample collection and administration of blood \[1\]. Further work established feasibility and safer practice in an acute clinical area, cardiac surgery. It was then linked to an electronic system for blood collection and tracking to provide end‐to‐end electronic control and documentation of the complete hospital transfusion process \[2\]. Staff found the system easy to operate and preferred it to standard procedures. 

 The rapid provision of red blood cell \(RBC\) units to patients needing blood urgently is an important issue in transfusion medicine. This has been facilitated by the development of electronic issue of units of blood \(“electronic crossmatch”\). The Oxford team evaluated a system for electronic remote blood issue \[3\] developed as an enhancement to the electronic bedside system and found that it improved the median time to deliver urgently required RBC units to the patient from 24 minutes to 59 seconds. The study also found that unused requests were reduced significantly from 42% to 20%, the number of RBC units issued reduced by 52%, the number of issued units that were transfused increased from 40% to 62%, and there was a significant reduction in the workload of blood bank and clinical staff. A later study across five centres in the UK and USA \[4\] confirmed these findings. 

 Oxford researchers showed the end\-to\-end electronic transfusion management system to be an excellent tool for monitoring hospital transfusion practice including compliance with national regulations for the traceability of every blood unit and national recommendations for the training and competency assessment of staff without the need for establishing additional procedures \[5\]. 

 This research was funded by NHS Blood & Transplant; the Oxford University Hospitals \(OUH\) NHS Foundation Trust; the Haematology Theme of the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre \(a collaboration between the University of Oxford and OUH NHS Foundation Trust\); and Innovate UK.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  Pathway to Impact and Context 

 The ‘end\-to\-end’ electronic transfusion process was implemented initially in all acute hospitals in Oxfordshire prior to 2013. Benefits described below have been realised from 2013 to 2020, quantified by follow\-up studies from the Oxford team. The team has long supported adoption in other settings, for example specification for an electronic process for transfusion was developed for the National Patient Safety Agency as early as 2006, and engagement with national schemes such as Serious Hazards of Transfusion \(SHOT\). Through this engagement and the dissemination of the primary research and follow up studies, the take\-up of these processes has been recommended in national guidelines from 2015 onwards. The Oxford team also developed a long\-standing collaboration with Haemonetics Ltd \(Boston\), enabling incorporation of research findings into Haemonetics’ commercially available software and products, including the BloodTrack® system, which are now marketed internationally. 

####  Benefits to Clinical Practice 

 The development of a process for electronic blood product ordering with an integrated clinical decision support system \(CDSS\) allows collection of data regarding the patient’s clinical condition and the justification for the blood product order. An alert is generated in real time if the order is outside agreed guidelines. Feedback is provided to clinicians in several ways including contact with the prescribing clinician if an alert is generated, to ask for further information and if necessary, provide education; an online dashboard allowing all clinicians to visualise their blood ordering practice; a summary report circulated on a quarterly basis to senior clinical staff for cascade to their teams; and monthly review meetings with the junior haematology doctors. These processes have multiple benefits: 

 **Improvements to Patient Care and Safety:** A study with Serious Hazards of Transfusion \(SHOT\) analysed data from 57 wrong component transfused \(WCT\) events from approximately 2,000,000 blood component transfusions administered in the UK in 2015 and 2016 and showed that patient safety has been improved by reduced wrong transfusion events and avoidance of unnecessary transfusion. In cases that related to sample labelling, blood collection and administration, no WCTs occurred with sampling or administration using electronic processes, whereas 17 WCTs occurred with manual processes \[A **\(**i\)\]. 

 **Improvements in compliance with good practice.** Local data has found much greater compliance with correct procedures and fewer errors \[1,2,5\]. Murphy and colleagues found that significant improvements were made following the introduction of the electronic system, including a rise from 8% to 100% in checking that the blood group and unit number on the blood pack matched the compatibility label and the pack was in date  \(p≤0.0001\). Similar significant improvements were found in blood sample collection, the collection of blood from blood refrigerators, and the documentation of transfusion. Improved compliance with guidelines for transfusion and avoidance of unnecessary transfusion following the implementation of electronic blood ordering; for example, in the haematology ward in an Oxford hospital, compliance with RBC transfusion guidelines increased from 74% in 2014 to 95% in 2019 \[A\(ii\)\]. 

 **Improvements In Staff Time and Efficiency.  The Oxford team also found that staff found the system easy to operate and preferred it to standard procedures \[2\]. The process involves one nurse rather than two, and there is a 50% reduction in the time for a nurse to undertake pre\-transfusion patient/blood identification at the bedside \[1\]. The speed of delivery of blood for urgent transfusions through electronic remote blood issue has also been increased \[3,6\]. The electronic remote issue process avoids the need for multiple blood transfusion laboratories in centres with several hospitals as blood can be provided safely for urgent cases at remote sites. This has meant that the transfusion service in Oxfordshire operates from a central laboratory at the John Radcliffe with satellites at the Churchill and Horton Hospitals rather than with 3\-4 stand\-alone blood transfusion laboratories. 

####  National and International Guidance 

 In the **NICE guideline on blood transfusion \(2015\) using an electronic patient identification system when undertaking blood transfusion is recommended in the guideline \[B\] largely based on the Oxford research \[5\]. The research was also endorsed nationally as an NHS QIPP \(Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention\) case study in 2016, entitiled:  “ *Electronic blood transfusion: improving safety and efficiency of transfusion systems”* \[C\]. 

 The **British Society for Haematology guidelines** on the administration of blood components \(2017\) state that *“…Electronic patient ID: Electronic systems are available to help improve patient ID procedures…”*  and *“the systems employed must be robustly designed and implemented to ensure that patient safety is enhanced”* \[D\] *,* in both cases citing \[5\]. 

 The research provided the evidence for a recommendation in the 2017 **Annual Report of the Serious Hazards of Transfusion \(SHOT\) scheme** \[E\]: 

 “*All available information technology \(IT\) systems to support transfusion practice should be considered and these systems implemented to their full functionality. Electronic blood management systems should be considered in all clinical settings where transfusion takes place. This is no longer an innovative approach to safe transfusion practice, it is the standard that all should aim for. Action: Hospital Chief Executives, Hospital Risk Managers and Hospital Transfusion Teams.”* \[E\]. 

 The Medical Director for SHOT confirmed in October 2020, 

 “*The use of barcode scanning technology…has proved to be a simple but effective way to reduce errors at the point of sample collection. Professor Murphy’s seminal studies on this practical solution…were highly successful at his home institution at Oxford. The resulting publications demonstrating a clear safety benefit to patients has helped to stimulate the adoption of electronic patient identification in the UK and internationally. This was one of the key SHOT recommendations in 2017 and SHOT continue to stress the importance of incorporating electronic blood management in all clinical settings where transfusion takes place*.” \[L\(ii\)\] 

 Professor Murphy provided information, advice and guidance to the **Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch \(HSIB\)** during their 2019 investigation into solutions to prevent wrongly labelled blood samples \[F\].  In its report entitled “ *Wrong Patient Details On Blood Sample \- Healthcare Safety Investigation I2019/003*” the HSIB Recommendation 2019/46 was that *“ … NHSX should take steps to ensure the adoption and ongoing use of electronic systems for identification, blood sample collection and labelling”.* 

 Internationally, the 2016 haemovigilance report from Australia’s National Blood Authority highlighted the importance of technology, including portable barcode readers and/or radio\-frequency identification scanners, to reduce transfusion process\-related errors, and the value of decision support tools to improve clinical prescribing, based on the Oxford research \[G,L\(iii\)\]. 

####  Cost savings in the NHS 

 The Chief Medical Officer, in her 2014/ *2015 NIHR Annual Report*, highlighted the savings resulting from the system: 

 *“... a new blood management system trialled and tested by our Oxford NIHR Biomedical Research Centre saved Oxford University NHS trust half a million pounds* \[GBP500,000\] *last year. It uses barcode patient identification syste guaranteeing each and every patient reciveds the right blood in the right amount. This system, if implemented across the NHS could create savings of more that £50m* \[GBP50,000,000\] *each year and is a fool\-proof way of ensuring patients’ safety.”* \[H\] 

 Longer\-term analysis showed the first hospital\-wide implementation of electronic blood ordering and decision support in Oxford hospitals resulted in a 26% reduction \(USD1,340,000; GBP1,000,000 per year\) in blood costs over the period 2013\-2019 \[A\(ii\)\]. 

####  National and international implementation 

 A survey of UK hospitals participating in SHOT published in 2019 found that over 50% of UK hospitals were using an electronic system for the bedside transfusion process and/or blood collection from blood refrigerators. \[A\(i\)\]. The NHS Blood and Transport 2018 national comparative audit of blood transfusion demonstrated a widespread adoption of the remote blood allocation systems, with 67.5% of hospital now utilising these \[I\]. 

 The Co\-Director of the Massachusetts General Hospital confirmed that “ *As a direct consequence of the work at Oxford, my hospital began in 2012 to develop a similar system for patient identification and safe transfusion”* \[L\(i\)\]. A recently reported study \[J\] shows a step\-change in compliance with basic patient identification in theatre at the time of transfusion upon its implementation in 2014. Adoption has also been confirmed in Toronto \[L\(i\)\] and a leading Australian hospital \[L\(iii\)\]. 

 As at October 2020, the *Haemonetics* BloodTrack® system has been implemented in the NHS in \[text removed for publication\]; in Ireland in \[text removed for publication\]; and in many other countries including in the United States, where it is used in \[text removed for publication\].  In Italy, where market entry commenced in 2018, it has been implemented in \[text removed for publication\] and during 2020 the software has been translated into French, Spanish and German \[K\]. The The Co\-Director of the Massachusetts General Hospital  corroborates that “ *commercial systems such as Haemosafe® and Bloodtrack® have recently been introduced in an effort to reduce barriers to implementation. These commercial systems are fundamentally based on the original Oxford work.*” \[L\(i\)\]. The General Manager \(Hospital, W. Europe\) for Haemonetics confirmed: “ *It’s quite clear that the relationship we have enjoyed with yourself and the EBTS team in Oxford has had far reaching impact to transfusion safety very broadly in the UK and with increasing presence around the Globe.”* \[K\] 

 The Oxford team is continuing to work on enhancing the electronic transfusion process, and supporting other hospitals to implement it including further documentation of the clinical and economic benefits in the largest implementation to date at Barts Health \(4 acute hospital sites serving 2,500,000 people in east London\) \[L\(iv\)\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Speech and audio recordings are routinely analysed for investigative and evidential purposes around the world. Research conducted by the Forensic Speech Science group at York, through collaboration with partners J P French Associates and Nuance Communications, is central to developments in all aspects of the field. The two main strands of impact are: \(i\) developing UK policy by informing the Forensic Regulator’s guidance for the field and providing advice to government, and \(ii\) conducting forensic casework that affects decisions made by courts both nationally and internationally, as well as enhancing the professional practices of experts and organisations in the field. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 York is a world\-leading research centre for Forensic Speech Science \(FSS\) and has secured c.GBP2,000,000 in UKRI funding since August 2013. Members of the group are authorities in FSS and have published on all aspects of the field, through a wide range of empirical research, as well as extensively referenced overviews of the discipline, such as a contribution to the major Oxford handbook in the area \[3.1\]. Our research is interdisciplinary, bringing together phonetics and sociolinguistics with engineering, statistics, and psychology. We also benefit from a long\-standing relationship with J P French Associates \(JPFA\), the UK’s largest independent forensic speech and audio laboratory. The impact of York research on JPFA was the basis for our 2014 REF case study. Since then, we have actively strengthened this relationship, with **French** and **Harrison**, both directors at JPFA, now employed on fractional contracts within the Department. This is a unique pathway to impact that means our research is directly informed by forensic practitioners and it provides a mechanism for continuous knowledge exchange. 

 A major focus of our research is forensic speaker comparison, whereby recordings of an unknown criminal \(e.g. from a bugged car\) and a known suspect \(e.g. from a police interview\) are analysed to assess the likelihood that the voices belong to the same individual. Our research involves developing and testing analytical methods used by experts in casework. In particular, we rigorously investigate automatic speaker recognition systems, which are increasingly used in forensic casework around the world. \[3.2\] examines relationships between different measures of vocal output that are used by linguists and automatic systems, and compares the speaker discriminatory performance of the different methods. Results reveal that errors made by automatic systems can be resolved by experts using auditory analysis \(i.e. detailed listening\), suggesting that a combined approach of automatic and linguistic methods is optimal in speaker comparison. We have also conducted research testing the sensitivity of automatic systems to regional variations in accent using the state\-of\-the\-art Nuance Forensics system \[3.3\]. Results show that while overall error rates are relatively unaffected by accent, the results for individuals may be considerably over\-inflated when using mismatched accent data. 

 To understand how individual voices differ from each other, it is essential to examine structured variation according to regional and social factors. For example, \[3.4\] describes phonetic, phonological, and morphosyntactic differences between accents in the North East of England \- accents that are often confused by lay people from outside the North East. Such work is essential for forensic casework, as experts must consider not only the similarities between the suspect’s voice and that of the unknown criminal, but also the distinctiveness of the voice relative to other speakers in the population \- the more unusual the voice, the stronger the evidence. Our sociolinguistic research allows experts to judge distinctiveness in a more objective way than relying on their experience alone. Sociolinguistic knowledge can also be applied to other forensically relevant questions, such as ‘Language Analysis in the Asylum Process’ \(LAAP\) cases, where language is used to help determine an individual’s country of origin. There is much debate about the best methods to use in such cases and our research has empirically tested the performance of linguists and native speakers with a view to integrating approaches. The findings provide new insights into the best way to conduct LAAP casework, which have been described in influential overviews of the area, such as \[3.5\]. Our research also covers other applications of FSS, such as transcription \- producing an orthographic record of what was said in a recording. \[3.6\] argues that transcription in forensic cases, where audio quality is often very poor, should not be undertaken by non\-linguists \(e.g. police officers\), and outlines a protocol for transcribing indistinct audio in forensic cases.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Forensic Speech Science \(FSS\) is the analysis of speech and audio for evidential and investigative applications. Since August 2013, York research has had considerable impact on the field. Specifically, we have \(1\) guided national\-level Government policy and \(2\) contributed to high\-profile national and international casework and informed professional practice in the field. 

 **Background:** In the UK alone, there are an estimated 600 cases per year involving FSS analysis, and J P French Associates \(JPFA\) has consulted on more of these than any other expert or firm \(around 120\-200 cases and consultations per year\) \[5.1a\]. Law enforcement and security services also regularly use speech and audio analysis for investigative purposes. Outside the UK, FSS casework is often undertaken by Government forensic laboratories. However, as many countries do not have dedicated labs, JPFA regularly conduct casework internationally, especially in high profile cases \[5.1a\]. FSS methods have developed considerably in recent years, most notably through the adoption of automatic speaker recognition \(ASR\) software and new frameworks for expressing conclusions. Forensic science, as a whole, is under increasing pressure to improve standards, in light of high\-profile miscarriages of justice based on unscientific and untested forensic evidence. The UK Government Forensic Science Regulator is responsible for improving the quality of forensic evidence, through a process of accreditation, in line with international standards \(ISO/IEC17025\). Accreditation is becoming a crucial factor in courts’ decisions about the admissibility of expert evidence and the weight attached to it. 

 **Impact:** 

####  \(1\) Policy 

-  In 2013, the Forensic Science Regulator appointed **French** to chair a five\-member committee for Forensic Speech and Audio, which included **Harrison** and **Watt**. As confirmed by \[text removed for publication\], York members were recruited on the basis of their long\-standing research expertise in the field \[5.1b\], underpinned by publications such as \[3.1\]. The committee produced an Appendix to the Regulator’s Code of Practice and Conduct, published in 2016 \[5.2a\] with a second issue published in 2020 \[5.2b\]. The Appendix provides specific guidance on record keeping, handling of materials, methods and validation in FSS. This is the Government’s official guidance for the area, and it is incumbent on experts to follow the recommendations. The Regulator’s Code of Practice, of which the Appendix is a part, will be used when assessing forensic laboratories for accreditation purposes \[5.2c\] and so it will be essential to show compliance with the guidance. As a result of the guidance in the Appendix, \[text removed for publication\] is now “including statements \(in reports\) that note equipment can have impact on the quality of … outputs” \[5.1b\]. York members “continue to provide guidance through the committee as part of the Regulator’s ongoing efforts to update and streamline the Code of Practice for the forensic science sector” \[5.1b\]. 

-  In 2015, our research informed an official briefing document for MPs on forensic linguistics and phonetics \[5.3\], produced by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology \(POST\). The document was written in consultation with **French** and **Watt**, and makes extensive reference to our research, particularly in speaker comparison \[3.1\] and Language Analysis in the Asylum Process \(LAAP\) \[3.5\]. The document was used by Roger Mullin MP as the basis of a Private Members Bill to introduce standards into the field, which was brought before the House of Commons in 2016 \[5.1c, 5.4\]. The Knowledge Exchange Lead at POST states that “ **French** and colleagues provided further insights, crucial to my understanding of the topic, which fed into my drafting of the briefing” and that “expert insights provided by researchers from York, supported by their publications, were key to the development of the POSTnote \[briefing\] on Forensic Language Analysis” \[5.1c\]. 

-  A BBC investigation uncovered alleged cheating on English language oral tests used as part of the UK immigration process. The company administering the tests \(ETS\) used an automatic speaker recognition system along with trained human listeners to analyse whether the same voices of ‘proxy exam sitters’ were recurring in their data. In 2016, **French** was asked by the Home Office to produce a report \[5.5\] outlining how well ETS’s methods were able to detect fraudulent tests. **French**’s opinion was that, on the basis of the information provided to him, the testing process was robust. **French**’s report, which makes direct reference to an earlier version of work which became \[3.2\], has informed parliamentary process, having been cited by the Home Office in its response to the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee \[5.6a\]. It has also been cited in at least five immigration tribunal rulings as the basis for not overturning asylum decisions \[5.6b\]. Both **French** and **Harrison** were called to a meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Tests of English for International Communication in the House of Commons in 2019. Their evidence is referenced extensively in the group’s report \[5.6c\]. 

####  \(2\) Training, professional practice, and casework 

-  York is a world\-leading centre for research\-led FSS training, through which we have influenced the practice of FSS practitioners around the world. York’s Department of Language and Linguistic Science offers the world’s only postgraduate \(MSc\) degree in FSS. The programme is heavily informed by our research and provides training in all elements of FSS underpinned by \[3.1, 3.5, 3.6\], as well as speech technology and forensic statistics underpinned by \[3.2, 3.3\]. As of August 2020, at least 20 of our graduates now work within FSS, police, law enforcement and security, and Government departments and organisations both nationally and internationally \[5.7\], \[text removed for publication\] \[5.1d\]. According to a Forensic Audio and Video Analyst at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police \(RCMP\), and former student on the MSc, the programme provides “both the theoretical and practical basis for … day\-to\-day casework” \[5.1e\]. 

-  In 2016, **French**, **Harrison**, **Hughes**, and **Watt** developed a Continuing Professional Development course in FSS. Delivery of the course is made possible through a partnership with Nuance Communications, the world’s largest speech technology company, who provide automatic speaker recognition software for teaching and research \(used in \[3.3\]\). The course has run six times between 2016 and 2019, with a total of 61 participants, the majority of whom \(approximately 70%\) were from national and international law enforcement and security services. Course content is heavily underpinned by our research \[3.1\], with a particular focus on understanding the principles of automatic systems \[3.2, 3.3\]. The course has changed practice at \[text removed for publication\]: it is now part of the training programme for recruits who are new to the field as it “equips them with the knowledge and understanding to more effectively carry out casework” as well as reinforcing “current best practices among ... lab staff” \[5.1b\]. An Audio Examiner from North Wales Police also said that knowledge gained from the course has “taken a lot of time\-consuming ‘guesswork’ out of what I do, now that I know I can expect a particular result by applying a particular technique” \[5.1f\]. 

-  We have continued to inform the work of JPFA. The company consists of four full\-time members of staff, all of whom hold postgraduate degrees in FSS from York, as well as **French** and **Harrison**. The relationship between York and JPFA is a long\-standing one and the appointments of **French** and **Harrison** at the University reflect a strategic decision to strengthen this relationship, providing a more direct pathway for our research to have impact on the majority of forensic speech and audio casework nationally and internationally. The JPFA Research Manager states that “York research is essential in guiding \(JPFA\) casework practice, both in terms of methods and frameworks for evaluating evidence” \[5.1a\]. The relationship between JPFA and York, and the benefits to JPFA from York research, have also been identified as reasons for JPFA’s high standing within the field by external organisations \[5.1b, 5.1d\]. 

-  In their roles at JPFA, **French** and **Harrison** regularly conduct casework that affects the outcomes of criminal trials. For example, in 2014, York research on accent variation in the North East of England \[3.4\] was used by **French** to inform a speaker comparison in the case of the murder of David Wilson in Sunderland. **French**’s analysis of a telephone call made to police from the victim’s phone helped police identify where the suspect was from \[5.8a\]; that call was described by DCI Mark Ord as a “key piece of evidence” \[5.8b\] in convicting Daniel Johnson. Our research has also informed high\-profile international cases. For example, in 2018, **French** re\-transcribed audio recordings for the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in the retrial of David Eastman, using the protocol in \[3.6\]. The transcriptions weakened the prosecution’s claim that the recordings contained admissions to murder. This expert evidence was delivered by **French** personally from the witness box and the judge referred to it when instructing the jury in the retrial, which ended in Eastman’s acquittal \[5.9\]. 

-  At a national level, York research has informed \[text removed for publication\] \[5.1d\]. Our research has also had substantial international impact on casework practices in Government laboratories in Europe and North America. York research “significantly contribute\(s\) to the scientific underpinning of forensic casework” at the Netherlands Forensic Institute \(NFI\) \[5.1g\]. Papers such as \[3.5\] are used by the Netherlands Immigration and Naturalisation Service in LAAP cases and provide “much needed empirical investigation of language analysis” for such cases \[5.1h\]. According to a Forensic Speech Scientist from the Bundeskriminalamt \(BKA; German Federal forensic laboratory\), York is “consistently producing research highly relevant for forensic institutes like ours at the BKA” and is “the only institute worldwide that pursues this line of research with this level of intensity and practical relevance” \[5.1i\], with specific reference made to our work on automatic speaker recognition \[3.2, 3.3\]. Finally, York research \(with specific reference to \[3.2\]\) informs forensic analysis in all cases conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Audio Video Analysis Unit \(approximately 25 cases per year\) and means that the RCMP “is more confident in ... internal forensic casework practices and produce\(s\) more reliable and robust analysis to support investigations across Canada at all levels of law enforcement” \[5.1e\]. 

-  In 2014, **French**, **Harrison**, and **Hughes** presented a research talk \(on work that led to \[3.2\]\) at a workshop run by the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes \(ENFSI\). ENFSI is a network of public forensic science laboratories across Europe that has the aim of promoting knowledge exchange and developing and implementing international standards. The outcome of this workshop was a set of guidelines for the use of automatic speaker recognition systems in forensic casework \[5.10\]. The guidelines make extensive reference to York research, including \[3.1\]. According to an author of the guidelines, York staff “made important comments that led to improvements of the guideline document” which has “become an integral part of casework at the BKA” \[5.1i\]. 

 As evidenced above, York research has informed, and responded to, changes within the field of FSS and across forensic science more generally. By informing policy and practice, at both national and international levels, our research has had wide\-ranging and far\-reaching impact that has shaped the field and will continue to do so in the future.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This research empowered communities in the poorest parts of the world to engage actively with Non\-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs\) that provide lifesaving aid. It demonstrated that local languages are crucial for NGOs to build strong relationships with communities and ensure successful delivery of development projects. Yet, remarkably, NGOs and government donors have historically regarded translation and interpretation as a low priority. NGOs serving hundreds of thousands of people in Malawi and Peru adopted the recommendations, which has led to improved community engagement with NGO projects and more positive practical outcomes for such work. The research has been promoted as a vital contribution to UK government aid policy through Parliament and the UK’s national academies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Dr Crack specialises in the study of NGOs in international development work. She particularly focuses on NGO accountability, which is commonly recognised to include the responsibility of NGOs to be accountable to communities that receive their aid. Crack has built a research profile over the last decade through publications that draw on numerous in\-depth interviews with key practitioner informants to analyse the challenges for NGOs in meeting their accountability commitments. 

 Development NGO policies tend to claim that they seek to be accountable by: a\) ensuring that development projects are designed according to the preferences of communities; b\) empowering communities to participate in decisions about project delivery to promote a sense of ownership; and c\) inviting communities to provide feedback about projects. 

 Crack’s research has consistently identified systematic failures in practice in meeting these goals \(R1\-R3\), with failures in language\-based understanding at the core of many problems. While language is essential to communicative processes, the actual language policies and practices of NGOs have scarcely been studied, despite the fact that NGOs operate in territories of high linguistic and cultural diversity. The present research is the first to have explored how such policies and their consequences affect the capacity of NGOs to be accountable to communities. 

 To undertake this study, Crack co\-designed a three\-year AHRC\-funded research project \(G1\) with Professor Hilary Footitt \(Reading, PI\), Dr Wine Tesseur \(Research Assistant\) and the NGO INTRAC. The project involved extensive archival research and dozens of interviews with NGO workers, donor officials and translators/interpreters in the UK, Malawi, Kyrgyzstan and Peru. 

 The project found that NGO senior management often regard translation/interpretation as a marginal issue, and that the same is true for the UK’s Department for International Development \(DFID\), which is one of the largest donors to NGOs \(R4\). This failure to recognise the importance of language in development work leads to serious and significant consequences. 

 The research demonstrated a consistent view amongst NGO fieldworkers based in developing countries that effective local language communication is vital in establishing relationships of trust and respect with communities. Fieldworkers report frustration with the lack of clear guidance from donors and NGO management about how to translate development concepts, leaving them to invent ad hoc solutions that may not convey the NGO message effectively. The concern that translation difficulties marginalise the very people that are supposed to benefit from NGO work is widespread amongst such frontline staff, as is the perception and experience that this can lead to project failure. 

 In deriving policy\-oriented conclusions from this empirical study, the research team argued that NGOs cannot be accountable to communities unless they address these issues \(R5\). They produced a report written for policy\-makers and practitioners \( *Respecting Communities*\), which included several evidence\-based recommendations \(R6\). 

 Recommendations for donors included: 

1.  Invite NGOs to include translation/interpretation costs in their budget. 

1.  Ask organisations to state their language and cultural policies in their applications and value NGOs that have these policies. 

1.  Ensure that monitoring and evaluation frameworks encourage NGOs to reflect on how language issues affect project outcomes. 

 Recommendations for NGOs included: 

1.  Include costs for translation/interpretation in the budget. 

1.  Translate materials into local languages so communities can participate in projects in an informed way. 

1.  Encourage staff to acquire additional language skills. 

1.  Incorporate language considerations in project design.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 NGOs in Malawi, Peru and beyond, serving hundreds of thousands of people, adopted the project’s recommendations. The results are improved quality of data, increased levels of community understanding, and a greater sense of local empowerment. The project’s recommendations are included in high\-profile parliamentary and scholarly reports on language strategy targeted at the UK government. Government and DFID representatives have met with the research team to identify how the recommendations can reshape policy. 

 **Impact of NGO recommendations** 

 Crack worked directly with NGOs through the research process and after the development of the findings, sharing conclusions in accessible forms and advising on the development of the project recommendations into concrete changes in policy and practice. Following the publication of the final project report \(R6\) she revisited her Malawian research participants in person to provide organisation\-specific advice on implementation. Crack continues to develop these relationships with a view to continuing downstream impact, and has recently begun a formal consultancy role with Tearfund, one of the UK’s leading development and relief NGOs, advising on the creation of a new translation policy. While this will deliver future benefits, a range of concrete impacts have already been achieved: 

 *Recommendations D&E: Funding language costs and translating materials* 

 Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world and highly dependent on foreign aid. NGOs play an essential role in delivering basic services. One of the organisations that Crack worked with is the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, which recently received over USD500,000 for human rights projects in Malawi. The NGO shared the *Respecting Communities* report with its donors, who responded by allocating funding for language costs. The NGO then translated its materials, and reported a remarkable improvement in community empowerment as a result: *‘Beneficiaries are able to grasp the concepts, knowledge and develop the skills required for development at grassroots level…For instance, the people in Chitipa District specifically in Nthalire requested for Standard Operating Procedures for Proactive Disclosure of Information in Public Health Services to be translated into their local language.’* \(S1\) \(August 2019\). The participant states that the research has led to an enhanced sense of confidence and ownership among communities over the development process, as well as a change of mind\-set among staff working for the NGO as they *‘are keen to learn the languages spoken and understand the culture of the people’*. 

 Another organisation that worked with Crack is Trocaire, an international NGO that serves 181,000 Malawians. Crack’s main interlocutor, \[text removed for publication\], was able to draw on the findings of the research in order to negotiate internally for funding to translate a training manual: *‘Our volunteers have expressed that the translated manuals are very useful and are contributing to better programme results because they are able to facilitate gender equality discussions in an informed way … which has strengthened the case of allocating funding for translation of materials for programming in our organisation’* \(S2\). The organisation, which spans 17 countries, is now translating material into local languages in the other territories in which they work, referring to Malawi as an example of international best practice \(August 2019\). 

 *Recommendation F: Language acquisition* 

 Kusi Warma is a Peruvian NGO delivering health and education projects to over 12,000 children. Because of this research, they introduced a language policy to their operations \(S3\) \(June 2018\). Notably, as part of this, they paid for their fieldworkers to study Quechua. Kusi Warma now reports: *‘Our direct work in the communities, continually and respectfully of their local culture, speaking their language \(quechua\-speakers at the Andes\), establishes trust bonds with families, that contributes to the improvement of practices for the good growth and development of children’*. \(S4\). 

 *Recommendation G: Incorporating language in project design* 

 Crack worked with the Malawi Sexual and Reproductive Rights Alliance that includes six nationwide NGOs. Because of the research, they have translated advocacy messages, focus group discussion guides and questionnaires into Chichewa. This has *‘helped us to start getting data that makes a lot of sense and meaning from our project beneficiaries…The research has also helped us to reach our advocacy targeted audience’* because the translations have significantly enhanced local understanding of the NGO’s messages \(S5\) \(August 2019\). They now plan to translate these materials in the minority languages of Sena and Yao. 

 **Impact of donor recommendations** 

 In 2015, the UK enshrined in law the commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on development aid. A significant amount of aid is channelled through NGOs. The research fed into a long\-running and high\-profile political debate on aid effectiveness, and in particular, the ability of NGOs to deliver inclusive development. 

 In May 2018, Crack and Footitt presented their research findings to the All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) on Modern Languages, at the invitation of its co\-chair, Baroness Coussins. The donor recommendations emerging from the research were incorporated into the ‘Government’ pillar of the APPG’s National Recovery Programme for Languages published in March 2019. This document, officially endorsed by the British Council and the British Chambers of Commerce, called upon *‘Government, civil society and all stakeholders to act now to reverse this national crisis \[in the UK’s languages capability\]’*. \(S6\) 

 The APPG pressed for a governmental response on our report by tabling a written question in Parliament \(S7\). As a result, the research team met with the Minister for International Development, Lord Bates, to identify how our recommendations could inform policy review \(December 2018\). \[Text removed for publication\] confirmed the following month that he had *‘shared this \[Respecting Communities report\] with colleagues who are updating our guidance on programme design’* \(S8\) \(January 2019\). The reach and significance of the research findings were also demonstrated in a joint report by the UK National Academies \(British Academy, Academy of Medical Sciences, Royal Academy of Engineering, and Royal Society\). This urged the government to adopt a national strategy for languages, citing the *Respecting Communities* report as evidence that this strategy could strengthen the UK’s work in international development \(S9\). DFID’s own staff publication, *The Programme Pulse,* also highlighted the contents of the report. \(S10\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research into the effects of mergers and acquisitions on innovation by Professor Carmine Ornaghi at the University of Southampton has contributed to merger enforcement policies of the European Commission \( **EC**\), the European Union competition authority, particularly in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. 

 Ornaghi’s research has provided ground\-breaking evidence that mergers may have a detrimental effect on incentives to innovate, in particular in those markets where merging companies are developing similar ‘pipeline’ products. Since 2016, his work and expertise have informed and shaped the EC mergers enforcement policy in the area of innovation in two complementary ways: First, by demonstrating the importance of evaluating the overlap between the research activities of merging firms which has, in turn, led to the introduction of more stringent EC remedies in recent major merger cases. Second, by working on two related EC projects which have defined a rigorous quantitative framework for the retrospective evaluation of the impact of merger control decisions on innovation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The pharmaceutical and chemical industries are among the most research\-intensive industries in the world, and over the last two decades, they have been shaped by a sizeble number of mergers and takeovers. Indeed, many of the world’s biggest drug companies, such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, have been built through a succession of acquisitions. Starting in 2006, Ornaghi investigated the effects of these acquisition deals on the innovation of pharmaceutical firms. This was an area that, until then, had received almost no attention by academics and competition authorities, who were mainly concerned with investigating the short\-run effects of mergers on prices of existing drugs, rather than the incentives to develop new and better treatments. In this context, Ornaghi’s work was among the first to provide compelling \(and concerning\) evidence that mergers may have a detrimental effect on incentives to innovate, in particular in those markets where  merging companies are developing similar ‘pipeline’ products. 

 Ornaghi’s research involved matching financial data from large pharmaceutical firms with patent data from the National Bureau of Economic Research in the United States to define a rigorous econometric framework to assess the causal effects of mergers on early\-stage innovation. The resulting two articles published by Ornaghi on mergers and innovation \[ **3.1** and **3.2**\] are among the first and most exhaustive analyses of their kind and their findings have stood the test of time as they have been validated by more recent works. Since then, Ornaghi’s research has broadened to include the effects of competition at large on innovation \[ **3.3**\] and the impact of mergers on inventors’ productivity \[ **3.4**\] as detailed below. 

 **2.1 Effects of Mergers on Innovation in the Pharmaceutical Industry** 

 The first paper by Ornaghi in 2009 \[ **3.1**\] on the effects of mergers on innovation shows that on average, consolidated companies tend to reduce research and development  expenditure and to experience a reduction in the number of patents, compared to non\-merging firms. Ornaghi’s results suggested that mergers rarely generate the knowledge synergies that their proponents often claim. At the same time, the paper shows that acquirers are more likely to target firms with similar technology and drug portfolios, which may lead to higher prices and less incentive to innovate. 

 **2.2 Technological Relatedness and Post\-merger Innovation Outcomes** 

 In a companion paper published in the same year \[ **3.2**\], Ornaghi showed that in the pharmaceutical industry, acquirers are more likely to target firms with similar products and technologies and, at the same time, that there is a negative relationship between the technology relatedness of merging firms and their post\-merger performances. The study represents an important step towards understanding why some mergers have a positive impact on innovative outcomes, and others do not. More importantly, the paper’s findings have important implications for merger enforcement policy: as acquiring firms may deliberately target competitors with similar innovation projects in order to pre\-empt future competition \(a finding confirmed in a recent study with the suggestive title of “Killer Acquisition” by Cunningham *et al*., 2018\), antitrust authorities should impose more stringent remedies, such as the divesture of rights and assets pertinent to one molecule when merging firms have overlapping molecules under development. 

 **2.3 Competition and Innovation** 

 Starting from the analysis of the impact of mergers on innovation, Ornaghi has expanded his line of research by investigating the broader effects of competition on innovation in different industries \[ **3.3**\] **.** Using both patent statistics and productivity growth data, with state\-of\-the\-art econometric techniques to model nonlinearity in the competition\-innovation nexus, this new research produces fresh, robust and exhaustive evidence on the positive impact of competition on innovation outcomes. 

 **2.4 Mergers and Inventors’ Productivity** 

 In 2019, Ornaghi began a related ESRC funded project, “Mergers and Inventors' Productivity in the Pharmaceutical Industry”. While most  existing studies have looked at the impact of mergers on innovation using firm\-level data, this research aims to  examine how mergers influence innovation output of scientists working in the research labs of these companies, using patent and inventor\-level data \[ **3.4**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The idea that mergers and acquisitions can increase market power, but may also bring about cost savings in existing markets, is not controversial. For several decades, these two opposite effects have been considered by competition authorities when investigating the short\-run effects of mergers on prices. But, the effects of mergers on prices represents only part of the story: over recent  years, competition authorities have grown increasingly concerned about the effects of mergers on innovation and  incentives to create new and better products for the market. However, when it comes to evaluating these long\-run effects, economic analysis and, in turn, mergers enforcement is on much less solid ground. 

 Ornaghi’s research and expertise have achieved real\-word impact by informing and shaping EC mergers enforcement policy in the area of innovation in two complementary ways: His research first drew the attention of the EC on the importance of evaluating the overlap between the research activities of merging firms which has, in turn, led to the introduction of more stringent remedies in recent merger cases \(Ex\-ante Merger Control Decisions and Remedies\). Second, building on the underpinning research in \[ **3.1**\], \[ **3.2**\] and \[ **3.3**\], Ornaghi has worked with economists at the EC Directorate\-General for Competition \( **DG COMP**\) and the EC Directorate\-General for Research and Innovation \( **DG RTD**\) to develop a rigorous quantitative framework for the retrospective evaluation of the impact of merger control decisions on innovation \(Ex\-post Policy Evaluation Tools\), which are vital to understand errors made in \(ex\-ante\) merger control decisions. 

 **Ex\-ante Merger Control Decisions and Remedies** 

 From a policy\-enforcement perspective, Ornaghi’s papers, by showing that mergers are more likely to have negative effects when research activities of acquirers and targets overlap, call for a more careful assessment of “early stage” research activities and the introduction of more stringent remedies, such as the divestures of overlapping business activities, that the parties have to agree in order to receive merger clearance. 

 While the EC has conducted innovation assessment of mergers since the early 1990s, until recently, interventions based on innovation concerns has been relatively rare. For instance, in the 73 merger cases examined by the EC between 2015 and 2017, “ *the overwhelming majority of the interventions were based on horizontal static unilateral effects on prices \(66 cases\). Innovation concerns were identified in 10 cases*” \[ **5.1**\], with 7 of these 10 cases related to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. However, following Ornagi’s first paper \[ **3.1**\], described by Professor Massimo Motta, Chief Economist of the EC’s DG COMP from 2013 to 2016, as “ *one of the very few \(if not the only\) papers which were addressing the question of the effects of mergers on innovation*” \[ **5.2**\], the EC has taken a more rigorous approach on assessing the effects of mergers on innovation over the last few years. Motta confirmed that Ornaghi’s academic work shaped the EC’s approach in evaluating the overlap between research activities of merging parties, describing the paper \[ **3.1**\] as “ *very prominent in the analysis at the Chief Economist Team \(CET\), especially when we started to look at the Dow/Dupont merger. Some of the work on patent data done by the CET was inspired by Ornaghi’s paper*” \[ **5.2**\]. 

 The cited 2017 Dow/Dupont merger and the 2018 Bayer/Monsanto merger, two of the largest deals of the last decade, were cleared only after imposing remedies worth billions of Euros to remove problematic overlapping between the parties. In her statement on the Bayer/Monsanto merger, the European Commissioner for Competition noted that “ *Our in\-depth investigation raised concerns that the transaction \[would have\] significantly reduced innovation \[…\]. In response, the parties have submitted a remedy package worth well over 6 billion euros. It removes all problematic overlaps between the parties' activities*” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Ex\-post Policy Evaluation Tools** 

 From a methodological perspective, the ex\-post evaluation of the impact of mergers on innovation is plagued by a number of challenges, such as \(i\) the construction of a control group of firms which merged companies can be compared to; and \(ii\) the identification of markets where merged companies had overlapping research interests. In the context of a renewed attention of antitrust authorities on the effect of mergers on innovation, since 2017 Ornaghi has worked on two projects by the EC’s DG COMP and DG RTD to develop a clear quantitative framework that the EC can use to retrospectively evaluate the effects of past merger control decisions on innovation, which are vital to understand errors made in the \(ex\-ante\) merger control decisions. These two projects defined the most appropriate econometric techniques to select a suitable control group \(for instance, propensity score technique or synthetic control method\) and how to construct reliable measures of overlapping and similarity between the research portfolio of merged companies. 

 Based on his papers on mergers and innovationwhich served to establishhim as a leading expert on the subject, Ornaghi was asked by senior officials at DG COMP to act as an academic advisor for their 2017 feasibility study on the microeconomic impact of enforcement of competition policies on innovation \[ **5.4**\]. In this advisory capacity, Ornaghi worked with a selected small group of economists to define a sound empirical methodology to evaluate retrospectively the impact of mergers on innovation \[ **5.5**\]. The Principal Advisor in DG COMP responsible for economic evaluation of competition policy stated that "" *Ornaghi’s contribution to this project has been fundamental in understanding the different pitfalls that any study on the impact of mergers on innovation will inevitably encounter and in defining a state\-of\-the\-art quantitative framework that can tackle such empirical challenges in a credible way*.” She concluded that “ *Ornaghi has then made a fundamental contribution to a study that is shaping the future of competition policy in the European Union.*” \[ **5.6**\] 

 Soon after, between January 2018 and April 2019, Ornaghi worked as academic advisor on a second EC research project, “Study on the impact of mergers and acquisitions in the Pharmaceutical Industry” \[ **5.7**\], commissioned by both DG COMP and DG RTD. Officials of DG RTD testified that, during this time, Ornaghi “ *offered invaluable support and advice to DG RTD by providing a range of written reports \[…\] which have been widely circulated within staff of DG COMP and DG RTD \[…\]. Ornaghi had a leading role in discussing the limitations of the study and providing clear guidance on how these could be tackled.*” \[ **5.8**\] 

 Finally, Ornaghi’s papers on mergers and Innovation \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] and competition and innovation \[ **3.3**\] have been largely cited in policy studies such as the 2019 “Ex\-post assessment of merger control decisions on digital markets” by the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\), which evaluates recent merger decisions in the digital sector in the UK with the aim of assessing whether those mergers have had a detrimental outcome on innovation \[ **5.9**\]. Ornaghi’s papers have also shaped  the view of top civil servants as identified by the Principal Advisor in DG COMP \[ **5.6**\] who testified that Ornaghi’s papers “ *were well known among experts of DG COMP, including Dr Giulio Federico, Head of the Unit of the Chief Competition Economist’s Team*”.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Workers within the UK’s construction industry can be subject to unfair treatment. Research led by Professor Ian Fitzgerald at Northumbria highlights the scale of this problem among Polish migrants, revealing significant tensions and exploitation, yet few migrants seek out support from trades unions. Fitzgerald’s research uncovered systemic issues that hamper inclusivity at the Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) and recommended strategies to integrate Polish workers, including enhanced digital engagement and awareness of racism, subsequently implemented by the TUC on regional, national, and international levels. The TUC completely re\-wrote its *Leading Change* programme, to address issues within leadership and democratic decision\-making processes. Fitzgerald’s research further informed the UK High Court litigation for the blacklisted worker’s court case \(2014\-2015\) contributing to out\-of\-court negotiated compensation settlements of more than GBP75,000,000 from construction firms to nearly 800 blacklisted workers \- the largest ever compensation payment won by the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians on behalf of its members. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The 2004 accession of Central and Eastern European countries to the European Union \(EU\) and the Posting of Workers Directive \(where workers are ‘posted’ by their employers to other EU countries to work for designated periods\) sparked an increase in migrant workers to the UK, with a significant proportion arriving from Poland. Trades unions faced major challenges on how to recruit, organise, and support these migrant workers, vital to protect the migrants themselves, and ensure equal rights and pay for both migrant and indigenous workers, particularly in sectors that recruit large numbers of migrants as a source of ‘cheap labour’. 

 Since 2005, Professor Ian Fitzgerald at Northumbria University has led a programme of collaborative action research projects \- predominantly with the TUC, a national organisation supporting 5.6 million working people via 50 affiliated trade unions \(e.g. GMB, Unite, Unison\) \- exploring the experience of Polish migrants in the North of England and their engagement with trades unions \[ **R1**, **G1**, **G2**\]. This research was facilitated by Fitzgerald’s unique access to local migrant/Polish communities in the North East \(through his position as a Patron of the local Polish association Pegaz and his links with Solidarność \- the Polish trade union\). Utilising a mixed methods approach, including questionnaires, interviews, and action\-based research techniques, Fitzgerald’s research revealed the exploitation of Polish workers in the construction industry \- a difficult\-to\-regulate sector with long\-standing reliance on cheap labour and subcontract arrangements. This exploitation includes poor working and housing conditions, illegal employment contracts and bogus self\-employment, low pay, and violent employers \[ **R1**\]. Beyond this, Fitzgerald’s research highlights that migrants also face difficulties with language barriers and practical problems, e.g. getting access to bank accounts \[ **R1**\]. Working with Dr Rafał Smoczyński \(Polish Academy of Sciences\), Fitzgerald also uncovered class\-based conflicts within the migrant communities themselves \[ **R2**\], and racist and discriminatory behaviour from the local indigenous UK population fuelled by a hostile political narrative and misleading media coverage \[ **R3**\]. In relation to unions, this research revealed the difficulties faced in recruiting and supporting migrant workers, including overcoming the feelings of fear and insecurity that comes with their vulnerability. It identified effective strategies that could be employed to engage this group \- most notably utilising online resources \(e.g. networking and language websites\), connecting with community and faith organisations, and union presence on construction sites – to break down barriers and develop trust \[ **R1**, **R4**\]. 

 When the 2016 EU Referendum and Brexit arrived on the UK’s political agenda, Fitzgerald, collaborating with the TUC, investigated the actions and views of the trades unions on the issue, through interviews with trade union leaders and officials before and after the vote. This research discovered that for Remain\-backing trade unions, poorly timed and cautious campaigning with national\- rather than regional\-level messaging, did not resonate with members’ own experiences, and unions’ standpoints carried little influence in the way their members chose to vote. Unions also discovered the widespread concerns of their membership around migrant workers late in the campaign and were then reticent to engage with them to address any misconceptions. Ultimately, the research uncovered how out\-of\-touch unions were with members’ views and this was due to significant issues with co\-ordinated strategic direction, leadership, inadequate member engagement, and participation processes within their organisations \[ **R5**\]. This discovery led Kevin Rowan \(TUC Head of Organising, Services and Learning\) and Carl Roper \(National Education and Organising Manager\) to ask Fitzgerald to collaborate with them on strategies to address these issues. 

 Fitzgerald’s early expertise on trade unions and migrant workers’ rights in the construction industry and his later roles as a national UK expert in two EU commissioned studies on the Posted Workers Directive and the protection of workers’ rights in subcontracting processes \[ **R6**, **G3**, **G4**\], led to a request to be one of four academic experts in the UK High Court litigation on blacklisted workers in 2014\-2015 \[ **G5**\]. For this, Fitzgerald and his colleague from Westminster University, Professor Linda Clarke, used their knowledge and understanding of the sector to calculate the ‘lost’ wages of construction workers unfairly added to a blacklist \(a document which prevented workers from gaining employment, often due to ‘unofficial trade union activities’\) shared for over 40 years by well\-known building firms including Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O’Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and Vinci. These findings were subsequently used by Thompsons Solicitors, the legal firm leading the High Court litigation, to support their case.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Fitzgerald’s research has changed two main areas: 1\) Trade union engagement strategies, leadership and democratic decision\-making, and the integration of migrant workers, regionally, nationally, and internationally; and 2\) Justice for blacklisted construction workers. 

 **4.1 Trade union engagement strategies, leadership, democratic decision\-making, and integrating migrant workers** 

 At a regional level, Fitzgerald’s research informed strategic recruitment drives from the GMB and Unite and inspired ‘ *the establishment of new* \[union\] *branches in 2014 for East European workers across the Humber region’,* as acknowledged by Bill Adams, Regional Secretary for TUC Yorkshire and the Humber \(YHTUC\) \[ **E1**\]. Further, Adams attested that regional Trade Union Councils are using the research to engage with residents and newly residing Polish nationals through differing programmes and initiatives. Significantly in 2014, due to Fitzgerald’s research, through the YHTUC, the GMB were able to secure GBP75,000 and three \(headcount: 3\) project workers \(through Unionlearn, the TUC’s learning and skills organisation;  to help integrate migrant workers into the community \[ **E1**\]. This supported provision of training for indigenous and migrant workers, including workplace training in English for Speakers of Other Language \(ESOL\); ‘ *seven courses on Tackling Racism in the workplace for trade union representatives*’; and 2 workplace union learning centres facilitated by further education colleges were established \[ **E1**\]. These courses continue to run, e.g. the Trade Union Studies Centre, East Riding College, Hull included ‘Tackling Racism’ courses in their April\-July 2020 course brochure \[ **E2**, p7\]. Bill Adams stressed that these initiatives, inspired by Fitzgerald’s research, *‘helped to improve relations between local indigenous and migrant workers. In particular, in Malton North Yorkshire and Kingston upon Hull’* by ‘ *combatting issues due to far\-right activity’* \[ **E1**\]. 

 Internationally, Fitzgerald’s research informed initiatives in Tunisia through the twinning agreement signed between YHTUC and Tunisia’s general labour union \- Union Générale Tunisienne du Travail \(UGTT\). Bill Adams’ own positive experiences with the research in Yorkshire and Humber led him to emulate them within the partnership. Adams noted that this had many benefits, most notably the opening of a trade union learning centre at the UGTT office in Tunisia which went on to deliver ESOL training and courses to tackle racism \[ **E1**\]. Overall, this activity *‘helped raise awareness of diversity and international solidarity for thirty young trade unionists from England and hundreds in Tunisia’* \[ **E1**\]. 

 As a result of Fitzgerald’s research on trade unions and the EU referendum, unions recognised the need to improve the speed and timeliness of their democratic and participative decision\-making processes, generating discussions among affiliated trade unions \(e.g. GMB and Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers \(USDAW\)\) leading to best practice sharing \[ **E3**\]. Bill Adams stated the research *‘provided much needed weight to my existing belief that member unions can be too national focused \[…and that\] not enough due care and attention is given to the views of local and regional memberships’* \[ **E1**\]. 

 On a national level, Fitzgerald’s research has increased the TUC’s awareness and understanding of Polish communities, informing how the organisation approaches membership campaigns with this group. Kevin Rowan, TUC Head of Organising, Services and Skills, acknowledged that Fitzgerald’s work informed their move towards digital forms of inclusion and democratic participation with the Polish community, most evident in the formation of the ‘digital lab’ in 2019 – a TUC initiative aimed at building practitioners’ experience in new digital disciplines ‘ *to improve democratic participation*’ \[ **E3**\]. This included a series of best practice workshops run throughout 2019 and 2020, including the first one attended by representatives of over 14 unions \[ **E4**\], that *‘focused on areas of core activity for unions, such as organising, member engagement, balloting, and more’* \[ **E5**\]. 

 To tackle leadership issues identified by Fitzgerald, the TUC sought to improve the training it provided. Kevin Rowan noted that as a result of the research the TUC has *‘completely rewritten our ‘Leading Change’ programme’* – the training and development programme delivered to 20 senior trade union officers annually – to include modules on leading change with digital \(supporting the ‘digital lab’ initiative\) and democratic leadership \[ **E3**, **E6**\]. As part of this Fitzgerald was invited to provide a Leading Change Module \[ **E3**\], which Bill Adams noted is important for regional unions \[ **E1**\]. Due to Covid\-19 the module was undertaken online and finished in November 2020. 

 **4.2 Justice for blacklisted construction workers** 

 Upon the request of Thompson’s Solicitors, Fitzgerald and his colleague Linda Clarke \(Westminster University\) applied their long\-standing research knowledge to inform the High Court litigation for the blacklisting of workers 2014\-2015. This work involved calculating *‘a valuation of loss for each claimant, what they could have earned, had they not been blacklisted’* \[ **E7**\]. Fitzgerald and Clarke advised the Claimant Solicitors’ Steering Group team of solicitors over the 2014\-2015 period. Furthermore, they compiled an in\-depth report for the team using their expertise in the industry to determine the disruption to lifetime earnings, working patterns, and career opportunities experienced by those placed on the blacklist \[ **E8**\]. Richard Arthur, lead solicitor of the litigation, stated: 

 ‘*…this information was important in supporting our approach in court, as without it we would have had limited understanding of, and evidence to demonstrate, the true financial losses experienced by our claimants as a result of being placed on the blacklist, subsequently limiting our argument as to the amount of compensation required*’ \[ **E7**\]. 

 Fitzgerald’s contribution led to out\-of\-court negotiated compensation settlements of more than GBP75,000,000 from construction firms to nearly 800 blacklisted workers, with individual pay\-outs ranging between GBP25,000 and GBP200,000. Speaking on behalf of the workers, Richard Arthur noted: *‘Whilst these settlements could never undo the damage caused, many recipients were grateful that the companies had been held to account. The compensation awarded went some way towards enabling some of the workers and their families to rebuild their lives’* \[ **E7**\]. The story was reported in The Guardian \[ **E9**\] and the Construction Enquirer, and it is described as the largest ever compensation payment won by the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians on behalf of its members \[ **E10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ramirez’s research has integrated Scenario Planning \(SP\) with other scholarly fields such as Social Ecology, Sensemaking, and Design to develop the Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\). The OSPA is a distinctive SP methodology that has been influential worldwide across organisations and industry sectors by enabling a shift in the mind\-set of strategic management from closed to more open and flexible. Approximately 1,000 individuals from several hundred organisations have benefitted from instruction on the methodology to date via the Oxford Scenarios Programme \(OSP\) at the Saïd Business School. The OSPA has served as the catalyst for changes in strategic planning at companies such as Rolls Royce, and influenced policy and funding decisions within public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), the World Economic Forum \(WEF\), the International Atomic Energy Authority \(IAEA\), and the National Health Service \(NHS\), charities such as Diabetes UK and Mercy Corps, and even scientific fields such as gastroenterology and the chemical sciences.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Action research conducted by Ramirez and colleagues since 2005 with participants at the Oxford Futures Forum \(OFF\) – a triennial meeting of scholars and practitioners exploring new research collaborations focused on Scenario Planning \(SP\) – has informed the concepts of the Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\). The OSPA is a distinctive SP methodology that contributes to strategic management through an iterative process of framing, reframing, and reperception. This enables an important shift in mind\-set, whose effectiveness lies not in terms of old to new, or wrong to right, but from closed to open and flexible. This is the central value proposition of the OSPA **\[R1\]**. Ramirez developed the methodology with Wilkinson \(Associate Fellow, Saïd Business School \(SBS\); CEO & Secretary General, World Energy Council\), and Van der Heijden \(formerly Associate Fellow, Templeton College; Emeritus Professor, University of Strathclyde\). Ramirez and Wilkinson contributed jointly to the ideas in **R1**, with Ramirez providing 3 of the 6 case studies in which the methodology is grounded, working together with Wilkinson on a fourth. 

 Research with OFF participants has enabled 2 common divides to be addressed in the OSPA’s pedagogy – that between theory and practice, and between SP and other scholarly fields. In **R2** for example, Ramirez collaborated with Churchhouse \(then Director of Digital, Rolls\-Royce plc\), Palermo \(Manager of External Relations, Royal Society of Chemistry\), and Hoffman \(Associate Professor, Skema Business School\) to show how his co\-authors’ organisations had deployed the OSPA in their strategic management. The research has also integrated SP with other scholarly fields such as Social Ecology, Sensemaking, and Design to inform the ontological, epistemological, and methodological foundations of the OSPA, making it distinctive from other plausibility\-based SP approaches in 3 ways: 

 *1\) The OSPA is learner\-centric in terms of its methodological choices.* This reflects its core theoretical roots in social ecology. In **R3**, Ramirez and co\-author Selsky \(Consulting Fellow, Institute for Washington’s Future\) contrast conventional strategic approaches derived from neoclassical economics with a socio\-ecological approach to strategy. They propose that the latter approach better helps strategic planners to engage the unpredictable uncertainty that characterises turbulent environments. Consequently, the OSPA articulates a phenomenological approach to strategy and not a predict\-and\-control mode. Focusing on usefulness makes determining purpose and user a primary condition to establishing success – which differs from considering success on whether the scenarios unfold as imagined. This is taken to be impossible in the turbulent, uncertain, novel, and ambiguous \(TUNA\) conditions in which SP is used. Ramirez and Selsky worked jointly on the manuscript for **R3**, bringing specialist knowledge on SP and Social Ecology to the collaboration, respectively. 

 *2\) The OSPA is designed to produce iterative learning through cycles of reframing and re\-perception.* Reframing occurs at a higher logical order through a process of ‘upframing’, which invites the scenario learners to view their situation from a ‘macro’ viewpoint, situated in the future that encompasses the wider context. A complementary ‘downframing’ process then helps the scenario learners to immerse themselves in the new contexts they learn. In downframing, the learners experience the ‘micro’ specific ‘what if’ implications for practice **\[R1, R2\]**. In **R4**, Ramirez presents the theory and provides empirical support using 2 case studies developed with Mukherjee \(Associate Fellow, Oxford Institute of Retail Management \(OxIRM\), SBS; Lecturer, James Cook University\) and Cuthbertson \(Senior Research Fellow and Director of OxIRM, SBS\). Ramirez was the lead author and provided the overall argument and theoretical lens, with Mukherjee and Cuthbertson providing data and leading on the analysis. 

 Ramirez’s research with Selin \(Associate Fellow, SBS; Associate Professor, School of Sustainability, College of Global Futures, Arizona State University\) underlines the central role of plausibility as it guides and helps assess development of a limited number of contrasting, relevant, and challenging scenarios as part of the above process of upframing. Their joint research found plausibility plays a more significant role than probability in many cognitive processes of deliberation and decision\-making. Plausibility is preferable to probability in TUNA conditions, where probability is either irrelevant or a logical impossibility **\[R5\]**. Ramirez was the lead author on **R5**, with Selin contributing insights on plausibility. 

 Ramirez and Eidinow \(Chair in Ancient History, University of Bristol\) are the only authors in the field who have proposed the aesthetics of storytelling as a technology to create and share plausibility to analyse scenario stories in SP **\[R6\]**. The role of aesthetics in articulating plausibility is one of the distinguishing features of the OSPA. Both authors contributed equally to **R6**, with Ramirez providing insights on SP and Eidinow the classical view on aesthetics. 

 *3\) The OSPA is designed to help strategists and policymakers find more and better options for coping and succeeding in TUNA conditions.* In TUNA conditions, applicability of existing factual evidence to forecast is limited. SP complements and challenges existing strategy development, but it is not the same as strategy. The research underpinning the OSPA examines the wider context that strategy inhabits, independent of the will or control of the strategist, recognising the need for a balance of competitive and collaborative strategic action in TUNA conditions **\[R1\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\) has raised the quality of strategic conversations and led to invention and testing of new options and actions in multiple industries and sectors worldwide, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, energy, security law enforcement, and charities. Approximately 1,000 individuals from several hundred organisations have been through the Oxford Scenarios Programme \(OSP\) to date. The OSP is Saïd Business School’s executive development programme founded on the methodology. Alumnae have deployed the OSPA to the benefit of firms such as Rolls\-Royce, Anglo\-American, and Wärtsilä; intergovernmental organisations such as the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), the European Patent Office \(EPO\), and the International Atomic Energy Agency \(IAEA\); NGOs and charities such as the World Economic Forum \(WEF\), Diabetes UK, and Mercy Corps; and scientific and professional fields such as Royal Society of Chemistry \(RSC\), BMJ, and United European Gastroenterology. As illustrative examples, participants on the OSP have collaborated with Ramirez on joint scholarly publications that explore the ways in which the OSPA has been employed in their institutions. One such example is Rolls\-Royce **\[R2\]**. 

###  Changes in strategic planning at Rolls\-Royce 

 After issuing 4 profit warnings and witnessing a share price fall of over 50%, in 2016 the OSPA helped Rolls\-Royce develop a new strategic planning process that re\-orientated the company’s investment process. Several dozen top managers had participated in an OSPA\-centred programme the previous summer. This led to an appetite for a company\-wide scenario planning process. 25 mid\-and\-senior level executives selected from different business units, functions, and locations, attended a 3\-day OSP workshop, during which they developed a set of scenarios addressing core strategic questions. According to Rolls\-Royce’s VP Strategy: *‘These are now used…as a stress test of the resilience of the group and business strategic plans carried out at least annually, and also as one of the decision criteria for each strategic investment option being considered. It is acknowledged within the company that the use of scenario planning contributed to the acceleration of some key strategic investments for the company which otherwise may have been delayed until a future time.’* **\[E1\]** 

 According to the VP Strategy, the introduction of the OSPA as a tool to stress\-test the group and business unit strategic plans also yielded several ‘soft’ benefits, including: *‘an “unfreezing” of the senior executives’ thought patterns to become more aware and creative; a mechanism to “make sense” of contextual complexities and uncertainties; a structured thinking approach for considering alternative plausible futures \(even if not probable\);* \[and\] *an ability to collaborate in the wider industrial strategic arenas where scenario planning is more mature/developing.’* **\[E1\]** 

###  Incorporating longer\-term risks and uncertainties into the International Monetary Fund’s \(IMF’s\) analysis 

 The OSPA has supported the IMF’s mission across its 3 major business lines of economic surveillance, lending, and capacity development. According to the IMF’s Director of Strategy, the IMF consulted Ramirez on *‘how to incorporate longer\-term risks and uncertainties into* \[its\] *traditionally shorter\-term analysis.’* **\[E2\]** This led to 2 rounds of scenario planning: the first in 2012, the second in 2016. ‘Prof Ramirez’s research, including his book* **\[R1\]** *…served as important references for guiding scenario planning at the IMF. We have used recent research articles to motivate users* **\[R2\]** *, inform scenario design questions, and tailor scenario planning to users more accustomed to working with probability\-related concepts* **\[R5\]** *.’* **\[E2\]** 

 An ongoing review of the IMF’s economic surveillance activities uses custom\-built OSPA scenarios to identify work priorities that are robust in an uncertain future and will influence how the IMF allocates resources across its 189 member countries. The Director of Strategy confirms: *‘Our Fall 2018 Regional Economic Outlook for sub\-Saharan Africa* **\[E3\]** *used scenario planning – rooted in Prof Ramirez’s research – to call for an adaption of development strategies to demographic, climatic, and technological change.’* **\[E2\]** 

 In response to the 2013\-16 Ebola outbreak, the IMF established the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to provide grants for debt relief for the poorest and most vulnerable countries hit by catastrophic natural disasters or public health disasters. *‘Scenario planning helped IMF management to respond quickly with this new Trust by sensitizing them to how the Fund can help stop a non\-economic trigger from causing snowball effects on economic growth and stability,’* says the Director of Strategy **\[E2\]**. *‘I can attest that the OSPA has had a considerable impact on the mindsets of IMF staff... It helps us anticipate and cope with ongoing changes… we feel that we have collectively improved our ability to stay ahead of developments and respond with policy options when the need arises.’* **\[E2\]** 

###  Improving reception of the World Economic Forum’s \(WEF’s\) strategic foresight work with key stakeholders 

 The experience of WEF staff at the OSP, combined with WEF’s collaboration with Ramirez between 2012 and 2014, changed the way WEF approached scenarios and improved the reception of the Forum’s strategic foresight work with key stakeholders and communities as a result. According to WEF’s Head of Society and Innovation, WEF’s new strategic foresight project on future availability of natural resources **\[E4\]** ‘ *differed markedly from previous scenario projects because it focused specifically on a critical insight from Oxford research around the power and importance of surfacing assumptions in scenario practice* **\[R2, 5\]** *.’* **\[E5\]** 

 Application of the OSPA meant that participants perceived and experienced the new scenario method as a form of ‘interesting research’ that revealed competing assumptions, new dynamics, and complex contexts for the management of natural resources. Resulting project publications by WEF experienced a significant increase in media mentions and positive feedback from among Forum communities. *‘The project engaged in workshops and dialogue more than twice the number of participants \(300\) as the average project of its type and duration. The main project was also used to “reframe” strategic conversations around resources with stakeholders – for example, with the members of the Minerals Council of Australia, community groups and Australian policy makers in a series of very challenging but productive workshops,’* confirms WEF’s Head of Society and Innovation. **\[E5\]** 

###  Increasing revenues and prioritising the digital agenda at management consultants Kearney and Atkins 

 Between 2011 and 2018, 128 of Kearney’s international clients participated in the OSP, representing 29 countries; 50 of Kearney’s partners attended \(over 15% of partners\), and 16 VPs and Principals from the company \(194 participants in total\). In the words of Managing Director of Kearney’s internal think\-tank, the Global Business Policy Council: *‘The program with Oxford has led to a wider application of scenario planning across the various practices \(both industry and service sector\) of our organization. This impact cannot be overstated. By involving so many of our partners…we have affected a sea change in the firm’s conceptual point of departure, frame of reference, preferred methodology, and intra\-firm “communities” that champion the Oxford approach to serving the scenario needs of clients. The number of Kearney projects involving scenario planning has risen significantly since the onset of our program with Oxford. So too have the revenues associated with scenario\-related client work.’* **\[E6\]** 

 The OSPA led to prioritisation of the digital agenda at design, engineering, and project management consultancy, Atkins. *‘Impacts have mainly been in the justification for, and adoption of, technology\-led strategy, which has steered the priorities of the whole business,’* says the Director of Strategic Planning \(DSP\). Group Information Services were reorganised at the company in early 2016. Referring to **R1**, the DSP confirms that the OSPA *‘informed the strategy workshops undertaken in 2015 and subsequent years – and was instrumental in the prioritisation of the digital agenda within Atkins over the last few years. In particular, the 2014 and 2015 engagements catalysed the introduction of further external thinking into senior level workshops in the early part of 2015 – including the invitation to representatives from a technology provider and data analytics firm. This brought this area of the business to the fore and progressively changed the way it was articulated externally to the market.’* **\[E7\]** 

###  Tackling technological weakness within the Danish National Police 

 In the context of a comprehensive review of its internal strategic governance structure in autumn 2017 and full review of its corporate strategy, an OSP live case forced the Danish National Police to tackle their severe technological weakness and introduced the OSPA as an internal tool for management. *‘The impact of our participation in the OSP can be documented from the amendments that were made to the corporate strategy to the decision to alter the internal governance structure to accommodate semi\-annual reviews of the strategy in the senior management board. The decision to tackle the ICT assumptions head on resulted in a decision to launch a comprehensive review of the ICT organization of the Danish Police in late 2019, early 2020,’* says the Deputy Director, Strategy and Analysis. **\[E8\]** 

  

###  Diversifying income at Diabetes UK 

 66 staff \(16% of Diabetes UK’s workforce\) have been trained in the OSPA following the Director of Operations’ attendance at the OSP in April 2017. *‘* **\[R1\]** *was used as a guide by the scenarios core team we set up in the charity…it was read by our Chief Exec and Head of Strategy amongst others,’* confirms the Director of Operations. **\[E9\]** 

 The OSPA scenarios led to an assessment of the charity’s portfolio of income generating activities. According to the Director of Operations: *‘The scenarios had highlighted for us the need to engage more in digital healthcare and we have seen an opportunity both to bring in funds through our knowledge assets on diabetes in this area, and also to help shape the digital healthcare agenda for diabetes. We have agreed a staged investment process for several £00k in a programme of work to develop this.’* **\[E9\]** 

 In addition, the OSPA led to a new programme of work on inequalities arising from future scenarios: *‘One of the most striking conclusions we came to from the scenarios thinking was the extent of the new inequalities for some groups and individuals with diabetes that each of our scenarios led to. We have therefore set up a whole programme of work around this area…we are investing in this and have agreed that all our work needs to look through the various different lenses of inequalities that the scenarios highlighted. We are seeing this play out with Covid\-19 as it has highlighted the heightened mortality risks to people with diabetes in the lowest income decile,’* says the Director of Operations. **\[E9\]** 

 The above examples illustrate how the greatest value from the OSPA has come from organisations’ embedding the re\-perception that the OSPA has helped bring about as an input to other processes. In this way, the OSPA has contributed to organisations’ agility and adaptability by maintaining a more open sense of future and delivering new and different thriving and coping options, all of which are key elements of organisational resilience.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The UCL Institute for Environment Design and Engineering \(IEDE\) has led three major research projects on indoor air quality in schools. This research has: i\) provided the evidence base for policymakers in the EU, UK and London to change school designs, thus cost effectively improving indoor air quality; and ii\) set the criteria for best practice amongst building engineers and industry partners working on schools across the 27 EU member states and the UK. These impacts have, in turn, reduced the potential risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases like asthma among children and teachers due to poor indoor air quality. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Second only to the home, schools are the most important indoor environment for children, and numerous studies have found that the indoor air in schools can often breach World Health Organization \(WHO\) requirements for quality. Moreover, studies indicate that poor air quality has a negative impact on children, especially their respiratory health, absenteeism and academic performance. For example, poor indoor air quality as indicated by high levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> \(particulate matter, i.e. particles that have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres\) correlates to the incidence of asthma and asthma symptoms, including cough, wheeze and rhinitis. It is estimated that when extrapolated to a national level, a 50% reduction in average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in schools, for the approximately 10,000,000 schoolchildren in the EU, could provide nearly 60,000 additional quality adjusted life years. Furthermore, space heating currently accounts for the largest non\-staff cost in school budgets and thus school planners must be equipped with robust data to make decisions that both aid school budgets, and improve indoor air quality. The UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering \(IEDE\) has worked on three research projects linked to these issues from 2007 to 2019: 

 **‘Ventilation in Schools’** 

 Funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister \(ODPM\) Building Operational Performance Framework \(CI 71/6/37, 2008\-2009, GBP230,000\) ‘Ventilation in Schools’ was based on a series of field measurements investigating indoor air quality, thermal comfort and acoustic performance of nine recently built secondary schools in England. The study considered 34 natural and mechanical ventilation design strategies. It established: i\) that the dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub>, as a proxy for indoor air quality in schools is a function of the selected ventilation strategies under typical “performance in use” conditions; and ii\) while the acoustic standards are demanding it was possible to achieve natural ventilation designs that met the criteria for indoor ambient noise levels **\[a\] \[b\]**. The study also showed that most classrooms in the sample met the requirement of limiting the daily average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration to below 1,500 parts per million \(ppm\), but only a minority met the need to readily provide 8 litres per second \(l/s\) per person of fresh air **\[a\]**. The research shows that natural ventilation options can be a cheaper and quieter alternative to mechanical ventilation, while keeping within air quality regulations. They are therefore a viable and cost\-effective option for school planners. 

 **‘School Indoor Pollution and Health: Observatory Network In Europe’ \(SINPHONIE\)** 

 SINPHONIE was a scientific and technical network, created with the aim of improving air quality across EU schools and kindergartens to reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory illnesses among students and teachers caused by air pollution. It involved European universities and research institutes from 23 European countries, 115 schools and 5,175 schoolchildren and was sponsored by the EU Commission \(EUR4,000,000\) between 2011 and 2020. SINPHONIE used standardised procedures and protocols \(taking into account potential confounders\) to provide a coherent understanding of the effects of indoor air exposure in schools on the health of schoolchildren. UCL was the only UK partner contributing to all stages of SINPHONIE. IEDE’s researchers paid special attention to current indoor air quality guidelines for school buildings including thermal conditions, CO<sub>2</sub> levels, and corresponding ventilation rates taking into account specific indoor pollution levels. Drawing on detailed monitoring data from a sample of 18 classrooms \(heating and non\-heating seasons\) from six London schools, behavioural, health and environmental factors linked to pollution levels were analysed and the adequacy of CO<sub>2</sub> as an overall predictor for indoor air quality in classrooms was evaluated **\[c\]**. The research showed that schoolchildren exposed to above or equal median concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, benzene, limonene, ozone and radon were significantly more likely to suffer from upper airways, lower airways, eye and systemic disorders. Increased odds were also observed for any symptom among schoolchildren exposed to concentrations of limonene and ozone above median values. Results also showed that increased ventilation rate was significantly associated with decreased odds of suffering from eye and skin disorders whereas similar association was observed between temperature and upper airways symptoms. The research showed that CO<sub>2</sub> measurements alone cannot guarantee a healthy indoor environment in schools **\[c\] \[d\]**. Instead, a comprehensive list of indoor air quality parameters is necessary within building design and these were established by the study, including the economic benefits of reducing the levels of nitrogen dioxide \(NO2\) near primary schools **\[e\]**. 

 **‘Total Operational Performance of Low Carbon Buildings in UK and China’ \(TOP\)** 

 Sponsored by EPSRC \(EP/N009703/1 GBP800,000\) between 2015 and 2019 and in collaboration with Tsinghua University, TOP conducted field measurements to explore how building design and operation could provide improved indoor air quality whilst delivering low energy and low carbon buildings including schools, offices, hospitals, and large residential buildings. Following a long history of collaboration with industry partner Eltek \(specialist data loggers\), the ‘AQ110’ advanced air quality monitor was developed to support this work. The integrated unit was designed to capture temperature, humidity, CO<sub>2</sub>, particulates \(PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>\), NO<sub>2</sub>, CO and TVOCs. This has allowed an understanding of both indoor and external pollutants, as well as their relationship to thermal comfort and ventilation rates **\[f\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **4.1 Providing the evidence base for policymakers to improve indoor air quality in schools** 

 <ins>Influencing the European Commission</ins> 

 *Guidelines for Healthy Environments within European Schools* **\[1\]**, published by the European Commission Directorate General for Health and Consumers in 2014, and sponsored by the European Commission’s Directorate\-General for Health and Consumers describes the guidelines for healthy environments within European schools. It has been translated into 25 European languages as part of the implementation of Regional Priority Goal III \(RPG3\) of the Children’s Environment and Health Action Plan for Europe \(CEHAPE\), which aims to prevent and reduce respiratory disease due to outdoor and indoor air pollution. SINPHONIE, as the world’s first and largest study reviewing the importance of indoor pollution factors including occupancy behaviour and mechanical design **\[c\] \[d\] \[e\],** was a key foundation for **\[1\]**. EU member states have adopted sections in their school planning approaches, ensuring that policy makers are equipped to account for indoor air quality in their school design plans. 

 <ins>Providing foundational research for the UK Department of Education</ins> 

 In 2014, the UK government introduced a GBP4,400,000,000 Priority School Building Programme \(PSBP\) to rebuild and refurbish school buildings in the worst condition. The scheme covers a total of 537 schools across the UK. In the same year \(revised in 2018\), the UK Department for Education \(DfE\) published ‘Building Bulletin \(BB\) 101: Ventilation, Thermal Comfort and Indoor Air Quality’. This document describes the factors that affect the indoor environment of schools, setting out the regulatory framework for ventilation in schools. BB101 also gives recommended performance levels for compliance with UK regulations and is mandatory for all new schools built under the PSBP scheme. 

 The dynamics of CO<sup>2</sup> in classrooms as described in ‘Ventilation in Schools’ **\[a\] \[b\]** differentiated how naturally and mechanically ventilated buildings affect the quality of teaching and learning spaces in the BB101 guidelines **\[2\]**. Furthermore, SINPHONIE indicators for indoor air quality monitoring form the foundation of Section 6 on Indoor Air Quality and Appendix C, with sources and research on the health effects of pollutants in schools presented in Annex B **\[3\]**. 

 As PSBP requires planners to conform to BB101, it is integrated into the design of 537 new and refurbished schools, their budgets, and their carbon footprint planning. A Technical Manager at the Department for Education indicates the importance of **\[a\] \[b\]** in the 2014 version of BB101 and **\[c\] \[d\] \[e\]** in the 2018 revision of BB101: “This work was important to change the default mechanical ventilation design that could have significantly increased operational costs and associated carbon emissions, thus burdening school budgets and increasing the carbon footprint of the school building sector \[…\] \[the research\] underpin\[s\] the decision\-making process of designing healthy schools” **\[4\]**. 

 <ins>Contributing to the Mayor of London’s audit on air pollution in schools</ins> 

 In 2017, Professor Mumovic was commissioned by the Mayor of London’s Office, to review the existing evidence and investigate the level of indoor air pollution in London’s schools in the report ‘Indoor Air Quality in London’s Schools’ **\[5\]**. The report found notable differences in the characteristics of indoor air pollution between seasons and classrooms depending on their microenvironment, building characteristics, operation and maintenance, indicating that annual personal exposure to PM in London’s classrooms may be higher than WHO 2010 guidelines. The report was published through the Mayor’s Office, with the simultaneous announcement of the creation of a GBP1,000,000 fund to help the worst affected schools \(200 additional schools across five London boroughs\) based on an audit of schools run by global engineering consultancy WSP. Mumovic was on the Project Advisory Board of the GLA Audit. IEDE research continues to provide the scientific basis for the Greater London Authority \(GLA\)’s indoor air quality initiatives, and the researchers are currently collaborating with GLA on ‘Indoor Air Quality in Nurseries’. 

 **4.2 Raising the profile of indoor air quality in schools in collaboration with industry partners** 

 <ins>Setting the criteria for best practice for building engineers</ins> 

 The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers \(CIBSE\) is the standard setter and authority on building services engineering in the UK. It publishes ‘CIBSE Guides and Codes’, which are internationally recognised as authoritative, and sets the criteria for best practice in the profession. 

 Co\-founded by Mumovic \(with CIBSE\), the ‘CIBSE School Building Design Group’ is a professional network that shares knowledge on the design, operation, and environmental quality of schools. The network was founded based on IEDE research, with Mumovic a committee member for 12 years. Today, the School Building Design Group has over 10,000 members \(including building services engineers, architects and facility managers\) in 22 countries worldwide **\[6, 11\]**. 

 CIBSE’s Technical Memoranda \(TMs\) offer in\-depth technical guidance on specific topics. All 22,000 CIBSE members \(including architects, facility managers, and people working in the building industry\) in 91 countries across the world are given free access to full texts as electronic files. Mumovic led two Technical Memoranda \(TM57 and TM61/64\) focusing on ventilation, emission sources and mitigation measures schools. The inclusion of IEDE research in TM57 **\[a\-e\]** and TM61/64 **\[a\-f\]** ensures that insights from research on design and indoor air quality are distributed globally across the profession **\[7\-10\]**. TM57 sold 794 copies between 2016 and July 2020, and this uptake is considered by the Head of Research at CIBSE to be a “significant achievement taking into account that approximately 580 schools \[were\] built or \[underwent\] major refurbishment during that period” across the network” **\[11\]**. 

 <ins>Co\-creating impact with industry.</ins> 

 Designing and testing innovative, low\-carbon ventilation systems for schools was the focus of a knowledge transfer partnership between IEDE and Ventive **\[12\]**. Ventive is a London\-based company focused on the design of naturally intelligent ventilation systems to deliver fresh air at minimal energy cost. The partnership developed and implemented an engineering design protocol and database. This enabled the embedding of indoor air quality and ventilation effectiveness in Ventive’s product development installed in schools. Using insights from **\[a\-f\]**, Ventive’s founder highlights how their Passive Ventilation with Heat Recovery \(PVHR\) technology products “now have better heat exchangers, and our systems are cloud\-connected to enable remote, real\-time performance monitoring, system adaptation and proactive maintenance”. The founder confirms the importance of this collaboration in the rollout of these products, indicating that it allowed them to “better understand and advance our design and test innovative, low\-carbon ventilation systems for schools \[…\] This enabled the embedding of new indoor air quality systems and improved ventilation effectiveness in schools, providing improved air quality for more than 8,000 children in over 40 schools across the UK” **\[13\]**. 

 The results of AQ110 Advanced air quality monitors developed with Eltek **\[f\]** have been published as part of ‘CIBSE TM61 Operational Performance of Buildings’ and ‘CIBSE TM64 Indoor Air Quality: Emission Sources and Mitigation Measures’, again sharing IEDE research expertise across the industry **\[9, 10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Law enforcement, search and rescue often require forensic search in challenging aquatic environments such as ponds, rivers, ditches and flooded quarries for recovery of human remains, drugs, weapons, explosives and toxic materials. Research at QUB \(lead: Ruffell\) has developed new methodologies using integrated GI Science and Geoscience tools for assisting the search for buried and water\-sunken objects, especially human remains.  The impact of this work has included: 

-  **12** searches for homicide/suicide and drug\-related incidents throughout the UK; 

-  **6** training events in UK, Italy, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, which have  upskilled law enforcement agencies on aquatic search approaches; 

-  Significant engagement with community, police and other groups, and articles \(e.g. *Police Professional, The Conversation*\) promoting geoforensics to wider audiences. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **Developing strategies for Geoforensic search methods in freshwater environments** 

 The forensic search for objects submerged in water is under\-developed compared to terrestrial searches, providing the impetus for this research. The objective in water\-based search research has been to develop a sequential multi\-proxy strategy. This includes: GIS\-based desktop study; Sonar; geophysics **\[R1\]** \(especially WPR \- **water\-penetrating radar**\) and survey endoscope methods that provide targets for scent dogs and divers **\[R2\]** in the search of water for items of forensic interest.  Working with our professional search partners, we have developed a **three\-step methodology** for forensic search in freshwater environments, detailed below: 

-  **First**, a **GIS\-based desktop study** of the environment is undertaken, which includes hydrological navigation/investigation and survey of the area \(e.g., models of water flow, which may transport missing objects **\[R3\]**\); analysis of any past search reports or surveys for sand/aggregate extraction; mining/hydrocarbon exploration; dredging of sediment; engineering works; and navigation, both historical and recent\). The chemistry of the water and composition of the basal sediment are both key in selecting possible methods to be deployed in the search, because some search tools work optimally in specific environments. This work focusses on the commonly\-encountered, yet unsolved issue of where items of forensic interest are sunken \(the concept of ‘ **sinkability**’* **\[R4\]** into subaqueous sediment\).  As the casework and letters of support here demonstrate, this is of major concern in serious crime investigations, as well as searches for missing persons and environmental crime \(e.g. illegal waste dumps in water such as abandoned flooded quarries **\[R1\]**\). 

-  **Second**, intelligence informs the search personnel of **the nature of the target**. A key objective in searching water is finding **human remains** \(due to accident, suicide, homicide or genocide\) and our work has developed and refined approaches in this area **\[R2, R3\]**. 

-  **Third**, evaluation and **selection of aqueous search assets** is undertaken \(e.g., remote sensing data, geophysics, search dogs deployed on boats\), all field tested and georeferenced by GPS **\[R5, R6\]**. Critical here are the nature of the target \(e.g. size, makeup, state of preservation\), the type of the enclosing medium \(e.g. residing in the water column; sediment\-water interface; or sunken into sediment\), and finally the target\(s\) location \- the GIS\-based pre\-search strategy allows the most appropriate search assets to be deployed. 

 **Development of WPR in freshwater environments** 

 Through terrestrial\-based casework for humanitarian search/rescue and law enforcement, agencies often ask for assistance in freshwater searches: **Ruffell \(2006\)** applied GPR on water \(“WPR”\) to resolve a dispute following a collision between a jet\-ski and speedboat in a recreational lake in Ireland \[ **R5**\]. This was the first geoforensic research publication pioneering WPR use.  WPR fills a niche in the application of aqueous geophysics for sub\-bottom profiling, in that it allows exploration of small \(from ca. 0.1 ha\) freshwater bodies where deployment of other techniques such as seismic surveying are problematic due to boat size and tow fish required.  The speed with which WPR data can be gathered in such locations makes this method useful for the search of such water bodies. Challenges also exist in terms of what technical \(e.g. antenna type, design, flotation method, survey method\) and environmental \(e.g. water chemistry, temperature, gas content\) constraints exist – the research led by Ruffell has refined this technique, testing it for a range of conditions and targets **\[R6\]**, making it an **attractive and highly applicable tool** in the wider suite of search assets. 



 *Fig. 1. Aquatic Geoforensics in action. A: Operation Amos \(weapon search, Leicester\); B: Operation Abermule \(double homicide search, Inverness\); C: Operation Igneous \(homicide search, Falkirk\); D: Operation Bennet \(missing persons search, Fraserburgh\).  Faces are obscured for security reasons.* 

 In the experience of the authors, search personnel can sometimes place too much faith in one or more methods or devices, when these must be used appropriately, conjunctively, and with caution that accommodates the known limitations of each technique. The spatial approach outlined above and detailed in the underpinning research section, is new in the forensic search of freshwater water bodies. 

 In recognition of the pioneering research detailed above and for his outreach contributions to forensic science, Ruffell was awarded the  [William Smith Medal](https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/About/Awards-Grants-and-Bursaries/Society-Awards/William-Smith-Medal) by the *Geological Society of London* in 2020.  McKinley, who has led the application of GIS\-based methodologies to forensic problems, was nominated to the *International Union of Geological Sciences* \( [IUGS](https://www.iugs.org/)\) Executive Council by the *Initiative on Forensic Geology* \( [IFG](http://www.forensicgeologyinternational.com/)\) \(and successfully elected in 2020\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 *Highlights:* 

  -  Following our pioneering work \[e.g. **R5,R6**\], search specialists in the *National Crime Agency* \[ **E1**\] and *Home Office* \[ **E2**\] became aware of the QUB research and criminal <ins> **casework**</ins> when searching on water.  These two agencies have consistently asked for **our support in applying our search methodology in problematic locations for serious crime investigations**.  Nine other organisations have requested similar assistance \( *Section a*\). 

-  Through the *IUGS Initiative on Forensic Geology* \( [IFG](http://www.forensicgeologyinternational.com/)\) and *European Network of Forensic Sciences,* we have provided <ins> **training</ins> internationally to** **over 200 police officers/forensic investigators** throughout Europe, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Australia *\(Section b\).* 

-  Outreach and public engagement have helped to raise the profile of our multi\-proxy water\-based search methodologies and geoforensic science more broadly *\(Section c\).* 

 **a. Casework** 

 As a result of our research expertise described above, we received multiple requests from law enforcement bodies \(police, environment agency, humanitarian, military \(\[ **E1, E2, E3**\]\) and search and rescue personnel, to assist in searches of water that * **applied our three\-step methodology**.  Freshwater locations may possess submerged hazards, limited access, vegetation infestation, and often have few landmarks, making them difficult search environments. This has resulted in innovation\-driven aquatic geoforensic research developed **in conjunction** with **law enforcement** and **search professionals**, each of whom observed the work and/or report here on the impact.  In sequence, the following have asked for assistance described in this Impact Case Study: 

 ** 1.**  Fire & Rescue Service, N. Ireland* \- search for sunken jet\-ski \(Co. Down\), 2004 \( **R5**\) 

 ** **2.**  Northern Ireland Environment Agency* \- illegal waste in a flooded quarry, 2006 \( **R1**\) 

 ** 3**.**  *An Garda* Síochána search \- drowned suicide victim, Fermanagh/Cavan, 2010 \( **R3**\) 

 ** 4.**  Joint *NW England Police Dive Unit * / *Home Office* \- canal survey, Liverpool, 2015 **\[E2\]** 

 ** 5.**  W. Midlands Police/Home Office* homicide search \(flooded quarry\), Dudley, 2015 **\[E1,E2\]** 

 ** 6.**  Police Scotland* search for missing person \(flooded bog; Fig.1D\), Fraserburgh, 2015 

 ** 7.**  Police Scotland* search for missing child, Coatbridge, Lanarkshire \(Fig.1C\), 2016 **\[E2\]** 

 ** 8**.  Leicestershire Police* search for a weapon \(attempted homicide; Fig.1A\), 2017 **\[E2\]** 

 ** **9.**  Police Scotland* flooded quarry search \(2 x homicide\) Inverness, 2018/19 **\[E3\]** 

 ** 10.** National Crime Agency*, Cyprus \- survey advice, two flooded quarries, 2019 **\[E1\]** 

 ** 11**.** *Netherlands Forensic Institute* \- advice to search for sunken vehicle, 2019 **\[E4\]** 

 ** 12**.** Training for the *International Commission on Missing Persons* \( [ICMP](https://www.icmp.int/)\) and 

 [EQUITAS](https://equitas.org/latin-america-haiti-and-the-caribbean/colombia/) \(humanitarian organisation\), Bogota, Colombia, 2020 **\[E5\]** 

 The Major Crime Investigation Support Inspector of the **National Crime Agency** \(responsible for advising on strategic, tactical and operational matters relating to major crime, complex and high\-profile Police search operations throughout the UK\) said of our work in 2019: 

 “*Dr Alastair Ruffell, who assists myself, other Police colleagues and staff from the Defence Science & Technology Laboratory \(Home Office\) during such operations where **his advanced knowledge and technical abilities are essential**… he has developed \(and continues to research\) a standard operating procedure for forensic searches that deploys a GIS\-based desktop study, modified boats/equipment and a geospatial multiproxy approach using the GPR together with Sonar and lightweight probes. **I am unaware of anyone else in the UK or Europe and indeed much of the world doing this kind of work**: some United States forces have used the method \(e.g. the search and recovery of Gregory Reedy, Oregon\)*. *Some operations I have worked with Alastair on include:* 

-  *Search for a missing person, likely a homicide victim in a flooded quarry near Dudley,  West Midlands* 

-  *Canal search for the body of Moira Anderson, believed killed in 1957 \(Lanarkshire\)* 

-  *Search for a weapon used in an attempted homicide, Derby \(Trent & Mersey Canal\)* 

-  *Search for two victims of suspected homicide near Inverness."" * **\[E1\]** 

 Writing about Ruffell’s work with the *Home Office* *Defence, Science & Technology Laboratory,* a member of the Frontline Support Search Team said in 2019: 

 “*His survey allowed divers to recover two items below silt level… **which allowed the investigation to move forward**. I have spent many hours with Alastair and have found his help and insight invaluable as we have been able to exchange ideas to aid police investigations... Our combined expertise **allows police forces to make informed decisions with the surveys using these unique capabilities**”*.  **\[E2\]** 

 A *Police Scotland* Detective in the Specialist Crime Division stated, 

 *“Without your involvement and expertise I doubt whether we could have come up with the successful search strategy we did.”*  **\[E3\]** 

 **b. Professional Training and CPD Significance** 

-  **Law Enforcement Agency Training**:** The cases above resulted in invited training events in water\-borne GPR deployment run by McKinley and Ruffell under the framework of  [IUGS\-IFG](http://www.forensicgeologyinternational.com/), including: \(i\) Messina, Sicily, 2014 \(for Italian Police and university students\); \(ii\) Canberra, Australia, 2014 \(for Federal Police\); \(iii\) Brasilia, Brazil, 2013 \(for *Brazilian Federal Police*\); \(iv\) Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2015 \(for Colombian and Argentine law enforcement\); \(v\) a training session in the *European Meeting of Forensic Archaeologists* \(EMFA\) 2016, Dublin \(with *Garda* Síochána and >5 other agencies\); \(vi\) an EMFA training weekend in Preston, *University of Central Lancashire* \(UCLAN\) \(attended by 45 participants, including the *Netherlands Forensic Institute*, Swedish and UK police\) \(2019\).  **These events all included demonstration geophysical tests \(for forensic search\) and forensic GIS workshops, with discussions around specific applications and needs. ** For example, in the EMFA event \(vi above\) the focus was on canal search techniques.  In the Australian and Brazilian events, McKinley organised more advanced training in the use of spatial data in criminalistics for search, sampling and scene management for crime scene management. 

 The  [ICMP](https://www.icmp.int/) Scientific Advisor in Colombia stated in 2020: 

 *“Search and recovery in aquatic contexts is a topic of great importance in Colombia, and is considered a very complex topic. We were honoured to have Dr. Ruffell share his knowledge with us and discuss the process of search and recovery with us…we all learned a great deal about novel and advanced techniques and approaches, some of which the participants will surely put into practice…”*  **\[E5\]** 

-  *In summary, training has been provided for law enforcement, search and rescue, fraud investigations, humanitarian agencies, government forensic scientists, and NGOs who use and develop the methods shown here.* 

-  **Other events:** In addition to the above, we promoted our aquatic geoforensics work through the following **conferences:** \(i\) **European Meeting of Forensic Archaeologists annual conference which we hosted in **Belfast, 2018** \(with 59 participants, including major crime forensic advisors \(e.g. Head of  [ICLVR](http://www.iclvr.ie/); Head of  [PSNI](https://www.psni.police.uk/) *Body Recovery Unit*\) and a crime scene fieldtrip; \(ii\) *Japanese Geological Society Annual Conference, 2015, Nagano* \(at the invitation of Detective Sugita, Japanese Police\); and \(iii\) *Institute of Forensic Archaeologists* conference \(Bradford, 2016\), amongst other events. 

 **c. Public engagement and outreach** 

-  **Media articles:** Our aquatic search casework has stimulated and enhanced public understanding of forensic science, as indicated by our non\-specialist outputs and media publications \(see **E6**\). These include articles in  [*The Conversation*](https://theconversation.com/how-science-is-helping-the-police-search-for-bodies-in-water-73931) and *Police Professional*. In some instances where aquatic search was undertaken \(e.g. the Coatbridge Canal case for *Police Scotland 2016*\), significant profiling in the media led directly to outreach publications and newspaper articles \[ **E6**A, **E6**B\].  Wider high profile crime\-related news \(e.g. the death of Ian Brady\) provided further opportunities to promote our work through outreach \[e.g., **E6**D **, E6**E\].  *Collectively, these outreach activities widened public knowledge and understanding of the role our work plays in criminal search.*  Because much of our casework is sensitive in nature, it is not always appropriate to publicise details of our activities, and we often request to remain anonymous due to the security situation in Northern Ireland. 

-  **Community and School Events**:** To further extend the reach of our work, we delivered >20 invited talks to community groups and school/university students in NI and GB including: \(i\) annual talks to the *Blind and Partly Sighted Group,* *N. Ireland*; \(ii\) *University of the Third Age* \(Taunton, 2018\); \(iii\) *SW England Geological Society Regional Group* \(2017\); \(iv\) Leicester University Geological Society \(2016\); and \(v\) *Donegal County Council* \(2019\).  The latter event was attended by Garda officers, widening our network in RoI.  We also ran popular sessions at two large *Science Festivals* \( *Belfast 2016; Monaghan 2017*\), both including interactive 'problem\-based' learning where participants were tasked with solving a crime. 

-  **Education**:**  Geoforensic water\-search approaches are integrated within a QUB UG module \(GGY3049 *Geoforensics*; \~70 students\) and UG dissertations \(2\-5 per year\). Former student *McCutcheon* used this training to secure employment as a Detective Inspector in PSNI. Ruffell delivers an annual class on forensic science to Ulster University Law students, increasing forensic knowledge in the next generation of lawyers.  Ruffell and McKinley delivered an invited forensic geoscience workshop for Hong Kong University in 2015, raising awareness of the impacts arising from the research amongst students and staff.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Movement and handwriting difficulties can make everyday activities and progress in education more challenging. Better assessment results in more support for young people with these difficulties. 

 This research programme led to the development of a new suite of standardised assessment tools. These are published by Pearson Clinical UK, and have helped occupational therapists \(OTs\) and other health practitioners, teachers and educational psychologists make diagnoses, identify needs and plan support for individuals to help them achieve their potential. 

 The main beneficiaries of the **Movement ABC\-2 Test** and **Checklist** and two handwriting tests \( **DASH** and **DASH 17\+**\) are young people with movement and handwriting difficulties, health and education professionals, and the test publisher. 

 This case study was included in REF2014, and the continuing impact is described here. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Extensive research led to the development of four new standardised tools to assess motor competence and handwriting skills in children and young people aged 3–25: 

-  the second edition of the **Movement ABC Test** and teacher **Checklist** \( **MABC\-2**, 2007\) **\[R1\]** for 3–16\-year\-olds 

-  the **Detailed Assessment of Speed of Handwriting** \( **DASH**, 2007\) **\[R2\]** for 9–16\-year\-olds 

-  the **DASH 17\+** \(2010\) **\[R3\]** for 17–25\-year\-olds. 

 Anna Barnett, Professor in Psychology, led the development and standardisation projects, resulting in the publication of all four new tests by Pearson Clinical UK. 

 The first edition of the MABC Test and Checklist was published nearly 40 years ago \(MABC; Henderson & Sugden, 1982\). Professor Barnett joined the original authors as project director to develop and produce the second editions. The **MABC\-2 Test** assesses three areas of motor development: manual dexterity, ball skill and balance. The **MABC\-2 Checklist** provides a complementary description of the child’s movement in the classroom context. 

 Professor Barnett’s involvement led to substantial improvements, including a simpler structure for the Checklist making it easier to score, revision of Checklist and Test items to improve reliability, and extension of the age range. Her expertise in standardisation and psychometrics also supported the provision of UK norms and the introduction of standard scores. The MABC\-2 is used with a range of conditions \(e.g. Autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, children born prematurely\), but its main impact has been in the field of developmental coordination disorder \(DCD\). It has supported practitioners to diagnose in line with formal criteria of international classification systems \(DSM\-5 and ICD\-11\). The MABC\-2 replaces older assessments, as a more robust and practical tool. The Bruininks\-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency \(BOT\-2, 2005\) is the closest competitor, with North American norms. It tests a similar range of motor skills but also tests other aspects such as strength, which can make results hard to interpret. 

 People with DCD often have difficulty with handwriting. Other groups, including those with dyslexia, also struggle with this skill. Teachers are concerned with handwriting difficulty because it can severely limit academic progress. Professor Barnett used her expertise in handwriting skill development and the difficulties seen in DCD to develop two new handwriting assessment tools – **DASH** and **DASH 17\+**. These are the only comprehensive tests of handwriting that provide UK normative data and standard scores for students aged 9–25. 

 The large standardisation projects for these tests involved working with expert panels, design of equipment and record forms, training over 150 testers across the UK, and production of the instruction and technical manuals. It was critical to test a representative sample, and this was achieved by using information from the 2001 Census on age, gender, geographical location, race/ethnicity and socio\-economic status. The psychometric properties of the tests were also examined, and Professor Barnett conducted several studies to achieve this. The large national samples and the validity and reliability of the tests are reported in the published test manuals and in international peer\-reviewed journals **\[R4, R5, R6\]**. 

 Funding for these projects was obtained from Action Medical Research \(PI Barnett, £51,301, 2005\), Harcourt Assessment \(PI Barnett, £102,479, 2005\) and Pearson Assessment \(PI Barnett, £29,957, 2009\). Professor Barnett led the research, conducted in collaboration with colleagues in education at the University of London and the University of Leeds \(Sugden, Henderson, Scheib\) and with assistance from a statistician \(Schulz\) at the University of Hertfordshire.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Use of the tests worldwide, including translated versions, deliver the benefits outlined below. 

####  Benefits for people with movement/handwriting difficulties 

 The MABC\-2 is used to identify children with these difficulties and confirm a diagnosis of DCD. DCD affects 5–6% of all school\-aged children. For example, a clinical scientist from Sunny Hill Health Centre at BC Children’s Hospital in Canada reports: ‘Because the MABC\-2 is user\- and child\-friendly and is normed for children as young as 3 years, it is an ideal tool to facilitate earlier identification of this disorder … identification and intervention are necessary to alter the developmental trajectory and improve outcomes of affected individuals. The MABC\-2 is the critical first step to initiating this process … the MABC\-2 has allowed me \(and many others\) to identify children with DCD, which has increased awareness of this disorder’ **\[S1\]**. And a parent says that ‘with the use of the Movement ABC report I was able to return to my son’s GP with the findings and only then a referral was made … I do not believe my child would have received his diagnosis and subsequent intervention without the assessment and report’ **\[S3\]**. 

 DASH/DASH 17\+ help to identify children and young people with slow handwriting. This is common in DCD and also in dyslexia \(affecting 10% of the population\), and other conditions such as autism. Diagnosis can relieve distress for the affected person, and gives access to support. This means students can benefit from classroom accommodations, ‘reasonable adjustments’ in examinations and understanding from teachers to boost self\-confidence and enhance academic performance. The charity Action Medical Research says: ‘The DASH test enables teachers and therapists to better understand the problems children with DCD, and some other conditions, have with handwriting. This helps to ensure children get support to help them perform as well as they can, especially in exams’ **\[S2\]**. For example, a student with dyslexia and writing difficulties reports: ‘I am really slow with my handwriting … when my tutor got the results \(from DASH\) I was allowed to use a computer for my exams. This helps me a lot’ **\[S3\]**. 

 From sales of test record forms between 2014 and 2020 **\[S4\]** it is possible to determine that 612,475 individual assessments have been made worldwide using the MABC\-2 Test, 164,120 with the Checklist and 384,877 with DASH/DASH 17\+. These figures are probably an underestimate, as practitioners may not always use a published record form, and translated versions are not included. 

####  Benefits for health and education professionals 

#####  Use of the tests in clinical practice 

 A leading UK charity, Action Medical Research, states: ‘The MABC\-2 test is now one of the most popular and respected tests worldwide for the assessment of motor skills’ **\[S2\]**. The test is widely used in clinical practice pathways for paediatric services nationally and internationally **\[S5\]**. For example, the lead OT from a specialist autism school in London says: ‘We formally assess pupils at their key transition points … to see what accommodations they may need’ **\[S5\]**. Another clinical lead for paediatric OT in London says: ‘we have a DCD pathway for onward referral to our Child Development Centre colleagues – within this formal pathway, we encourage clinicians to use MABC\-2 prior to making the referral’ **\[S1\]**. An associate professor in the Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Vancouver, Canada says: ‘As part of our standard clinical practice, I routinely administer the MABC\-2 … To build capacity of community clinicians to make the diagnosis of DCD, my team and I have developed evidence\-based toolkits for occupational therapists and community pediatricians. These documents advocate for the use of the MABC\-2 to assist in determining if children meet the criteria for DCD. The DCD Toolkit for Pediatricians has been circulated to all members of the British Columbia Pediatric Society and the resource has been posted on their website’ **\[S1\]**. 

 In developmental medicine, clinicians are often also involved in research. An example is use of the MABC\-2 Test in studies of prematurely born infants. A professor of paediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, USA describes how the test has been used in an NICHD Neonatal Research Network study: ‘this introduced the tool into use for the 15 participating US study sites, and many have integrated the tool into their clinical or site\-specific research batteries … I have found the Movement ABC\-2 to be an extraordinarily useful tool, both for research and for clinical applications’ **\[S1\]**. This is also reflected in the 1280 citations for the MABC\-2 Test in academic journals since 2014 **\[S4\]**. 

 UK and international sales figures show that a range of practitioners use the tests **\[S4\]**. In the UK 53% of MABC\-2 kits are bought by OTs, 10% by physiotherapists and 3% by doctors/paediatricians. It is also bought by speech and language therapists and psychologists. In the UK 11% of DASH kits are bought by OTs and 3% by clinical psychologists. 

#####  Use of the tests in educational settings 

 The DASH tests are used to provide evidence, enabling students with handwriting difficulties to access special arrangements from primary to higher education. A trainer of specialist literacy teachers at the Institute of Education, UCL says: ‘the DASH is an invaluable tool for practitioners in helping to identify where support is required and to monitor progress’ **\[S6\]**. A specialist dyslexia assessor says: ‘For older students, the DASH is also used to support access arrangement recommendations under Joint Council for Qualifications \(JCQ\) regulations’ **\[S6\]**. A specialist tutor at a college of further education in London says: ‘I use the DASH17\+ test of free writing speed routinely as part of assessments for access arrangements in exams. It is well suited to the purpose’ **\[S6\]**. The chief executive of the Professional Association of Teachers of Students with Specific Learning Difficulties \(Patoss\) confirms this: ‘Many of our members in UK schools report they use the DASH as evidence in applications for supporting access arrangements’ **\[S6\]**. UK figures show that 74% of sales of the DASH are to schools and 9% to educational psychologists **\[S4\]**. 

#####  Recommendations in national and international guidelines 

 The MABC\-2 Test is recommended in the International Guidelines on DCD **\[S7\]**. This publication by cross\-disciplinary international experts in the journal *Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology* is the standard worldwide guide to assessment in research and clinical practice in DCD. It was first published in 2012 by the European Academy of Childhood Disability \(EACD\) and updated in 2019 following international consensus meetings and systematic reviews. The international recommendations have recently been translated into Chinese \(Mandarin\) **\[S6\]**. A professor in occupational therapy at BC Children’s Hospital, Canada states: ‘the MABC\-2 is considered the gold standard assessment for determining Criterion A of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition \(DSM\-5\) diagnostic criteria for DCD as per international clinical practice recommendations’ **\[S2\]**. 

 The MABC\-2 and DASH tests are recommended by the SpLD Assessment Standards Committee \(SASC\) for the assessment of specific learning difficulties in the UK **\[S8\]**. The DASH tests are also included in the list of resources recommended by Patoss and the JCQ that guide teachers applying for access arrangements for pupils in the UK **\[S9\]**. The DASH tests are also recommended as ‘essential’ assessments in clinical practice guidelines for OTs in Western Australia **\[S5\]**. 

####  Benefits for the test publisher 

 The worldwide sales figures are proof of commercial success **\[S4\]**. Pearson Clinical UK describes the tests as ‘internationally best\-selling assessments’. Data from author royalty statements indicates that the number of kits and test manuals sold between 2014 and 2020 is over 2,500 for MABC\-2, over 7,500 for DASH and over 2,000 for DASH 17\+ \(current kit price £1000, £130 and £76 respectively\). With additional revenue from the sale of record forms and MABC\-2 Checklists there was overall net revenue of over £2.5 million in the assessment period. This excludes translated versions. Further evidence of commercial success is shown in a report from a senior product manager at Pearson Clinical UK **\[S4\]**, confirming that they ‘have committed to developing a third edition \(Movement ABC\-3\) \[and\) to developing a second edition \(DASH\-2\) … data collection is planned to commence in 2021’.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at DMU’s Leicester School of Pharmacy has provided new insights into the nature and scale of aldehydic toxins in foods fried in oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, demonstrating that human intake often far exceeds World Health Organization recommended limits. The studies have provided the evidence base for the development and marketing of alternative cooking oils by the food industry. They have supported the export preparedness of virgin sunflower oil producers in East Africa and marketing strategies for popular algae\-based and cod liver oils produced by food companies worldwide. Through sustained engagement with the international media, the food industry, public\-facing chefs and business owners, the findings have increased public awareness and understanding of the potential health risks involved. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A significant proportion of lipids consumed in the Western diet arises from fried foods, and rising consumption of these food sources has been linked to higher rates of non\-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. When polyunsaturated fatty acids \(PUFAs\) in cooking oils are heated to high temperatures, as they are during frying, a complex chemical deterioration process known as lipid peroxidation occurs, and high concentrations of toxic agents, particularly aldehydes, are generated. 

 Grootveld, among the first researchers to identify the generation of these toxins in polyunsaturated frying oils in 1994, has continued, at DMU, to lead investigations into the deleterious health effects caused by the degradation of fatty acids in frying oils, and explore the peroxidative resistivity of alternative monounsaturated fatty acid \(MUFA\)\-rich oils. From 2013, Grootveld’s group has used high\-resolution <sup>1</sup>H NMR analysis to explore the extent to which peroxidation by\-products of frying oil lipids accumulate in foods. The group analysed deep\-fried potato chip samples from food service businesses as part of these studies. They established that the total concentrations of toxic aldehydes present in both fried chips and packaged potato crisps were, on a ppm scale, at least 50 times greater than those of the potential carcinogens acrylamide and 3\-MCPD \[R1\]. More importantly, the accumulation of the products detected \(predominantly *trans*\-2\-alkenals, *trans,trans*\-alka\-2,4\-dienals and *n*\-alkanals\) demonstrated a clear route through which these harmful toxic by\-products from PUFAs can become available for human consumption. Since acrylamide and 3\-MCPD are subject to exacting regulatory limits, the research argued that similar limits should be applied to foods fried in oils with high aldehyde contents \[R1\]. From 2015, major developments made with the analytical identification of differing aldehydic lipid oxidation products, and the concentrations and patterns of these agents present in fried foods, have facilitated changes in viewpoints on potential toxicological and adverse health hazards posed by their dietary ingestion \[R1, R2\]. 

 Grootveld extended his research by exploring the peroxidative resistance of a novel MUFA\-rich algae frying oil \(MRAFO\) during frying, comparing it with commonly used sunflower, corn, canola and extra\-virgin olive oils. The novel MRAFO tested in these studies is marketed as Thrive™, a high\-stability culinary algae oil that was the first such algal product to be made available to consumers in the United States. The findings, published in *Nature Scientific Reports* \[R2\], showed that the MRAFO product generated markedly lower levels of food\-penetrative, toxic aldehydes than PUFA\-rich ones during repeated shallow\-frying, and thus appeared to alleviate health risks relative to the other oils tested. 

 Having established the presence of high aldehyde concentrations in fried sunflower oils, Grootveld analysed the molecular composition and authenticity of East African virgin \(unrefined\) sunflower oil products produced by manufacturers in Uganda and Tanzania. Results were statistically compared to those obtained on commercially available, refined sunflower oil products purchased from EU retail outlets. This analysis found that East African virgin sunflower oils contained higher levels of MUFAs and lower levels of PUFAs compared with the refined EU oils, rendering them safer for deep\-frying purposes \[R3\]. It also found that these products potentially offer health benefits through their high natural sterol and stanol contents. In a concurrent study, Grootveld’s group found that a multivariate <sup>1</sup>H\-NMR chemometrics analysis served as a valuable strategy for: \(1\) modelling the time\-dependent generation of aldehydic lipid oxidation products through shallow\-frying practices; and \(2\) the identification of their parent fatty acid sources \[R4\]. This approach could be used in future predictions of the risk status of ingested fried foods from the fatty acid compositions of oils. 

 The <sup>1</sup>H\-NMR methods were also applied to an analysis of the molecular composition and antioxidant status of four unrefined cod liver oil products, three of which were non\-fermented, and one of which was isolated from pre\-fermented cod livers. Results confirmed the enhanced peroxidative resistivity of the pre\-fermented, antioxidant\-rich ‘product 4’ over the non\-fermented products \[R5\]. ‘Product 4’ is marketed as Green Pasture Blue Ice™ fermented cod liver oil. 

 As a combined body of work, the research by Grootveld’s group at DMU has demonstrated that toxic aldehydic lipid oxidation products can be detected, quantified and thus monitored in fried foods, meaning that it is now possible to estimate the human intake of such toxins in fried foods prepared domestically or purchased from fast\-food restaurants \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Studies at DMU highlighting the generation of potentially harmful toxins through the exposure of PUFA\-rich cooking oils to high\-temperature frying have informed the food industry’s development of alternative oils that do not readily oxidise to ingestible toxic aldehydes under thermal stress, and an increased public awareness and understanding of this health risk. 

##  \(1\) PROVIDING THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR THE FOOD INDUSTRY’S DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF ALTERNATIVE COOKING OILS 

 The UK’s Department for International Development funds the Supporting Indian Trade and Investment for Africa \(SITA\) project, an Indo\-Africa trade partnership that aims to build the export capabilities of industries in five East African countries. As part of its efforts to support the development of the sunflower oil sector, SITA commissioned the East African virgin sunflower oil study that led to the publication of R3. The results benefited sunflower oil processors, industry associations and regulatory authorities in Tanzania and Uganda, who found themselves ‘in a better position to improve services to their stakeholders’ through the verification of the quality of their products’ \[C1\]. According to SITA, several sunflower oil producers from these countries, i.e. millers from farming regions, said the research findings support ‘export readiness for EU markets’. It commented: ‘Export preparedness and exposure to international markets is vital to ensure sustainability of the sector’ \[C1\]. 

 Thrive Algae Oil ® is a MUFA\-rich culinary oil produced from algae – the first of its kind on the market – that was originally developed and manufactured by American company Solazyme. It is available in US\-based retailers such as Whole Foods, Walmart and Amazon. The product was acquired by large Dutch food and biochemical company Corbion in 2018, who made a strategic decision to extend the sale of Thrive Algae Oil to the business\-to\-business environment. Grootveld’s *Nature Scientific Reports* paper \[R2\] ‘formed the basis for marketing material for Thrive Algae Oil’s push into the B2B space’, as confirmed by the former Head of R&D for Solazyme and consultant for Corbion, who also stated that ‘Professor Grootveld’s seminal paper on toxic aldehydesi in frying oils was a pivotal contributor to our decision to engineer an oil high in MUFA \(≥94%\) and low in PUFA to minimize the generation of toxic aldehydes during frying events’ \[C2\]. 

 Similarly, the research in *BMC Research Notes* \[R5\] reported the favourable peroxidative resistivity of naturally\-fermented cod liver oil products marketed by US company Green Pastures Products. The company’s General Manager of Production and Quality Assurance stated: 

 The finding of this project reveals the unique properties of our products and provides the scientific evidence of the benefits of fermented cod liver oil. The results have been used to improve our production processing, including extending the fermenting period to increase the yield and adjusting the storage condition to help save cost … A professionally\-prepared Health and Medicine Research Outreach article … and podcast based on these findings, which was sent to dozens of our wholesalers, facilitated the dissemination of beneficial product information to thousands of customers. We anticipate at least a 5% increase in sales will be achieved after the results are broadcasted to our wholesalers and retail customers in this quarter \[C3\]. 

##  \(2\) INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF HEALTH RISKS ATTACHED TO FOODS FRIED IN PUFA\-RICH COOKING OILS 

 Since June 2014, Grootveld has proactively engaged with the media, food organisations and high\-profile chefs to increase public awareness and understanding of the potential health risks of frying foods in PUFA\-rich cooking oils. In 2015, Grootveld ran a series of experiments for the popular BBC documentary series *Trust Me I’m A Doctor*, which were designed to determine which oils are best to cook with. The analyses found that the PUFA\-rich oils, like corn oil and sunflower oil, generated very high levels of aldehydes in contrast to the oils and fats rich in saturated fats or MUFAs \(like butter and olive oil\). Grootveld identified two previously unknown aldehydes that had not been seen in other oil\-heating studies. Based on the study’s conclusions, later published in R1 and R2, the programme’s presenter, Dr Michael Mosley, communicated three main recommendations to an estimated 3,000,000 viewers in the 29 July 2015 episode \[C4\]: 

-  To reduce aldehyde production when cooking by choosing an oil or fat high in monounsaturated or saturated lipids and low in polyunsaturates, with olive oil representing a good compromise. 

-  Minimise the amount of oil use when cooking. 

-  Keep oils tightly sealed in a cool, dry cupboard to prevent oxidation during storage. 

 During the programme, Mosley conveyed this message to viewers \[C4\]: ‘Some of the oils we’ve been told are good for us \(most notably sunflower oil and vegetable oil\), actually turned out to be potentially dangerous when used for cooking.’ He also emphasised that saturated fats like lard and butter, which are ‘usually demonised’, were least likely to produce high concentrations of toxins when fried at high temperatures, although they should be used ‘sparingly’. The findings broadcast in the documentary were widely covered in traditional and online media \[C5\]. This included articles authored by Mosley in the BBC’s online news magazine \[C4\] and the *Daily Mail* \[C4\]. As an indication of the impact of the media coverage on public understanding, the *Mail* article, which was shared 9,000 times on social media, received 1,130 comments from readers, of which nearly 70% responded positively \[C5\]. A large percentage \(64%\) confirmed that they would maintain their cooking practice by continuing with monosaturated and saturated frying oils \[C4\]. Another, albeit smaller group, said that they would modify their domestic frying/​cooking strategies to exclude polyunsaturated cooking oils as much as possible and replace them with monounsaturated oils \(e.g. olive oil\), a move that was in line with the article’s key message \[C5\]. The experiments performed for the documentary were cited in a ‘Fact Check’ article \[C6\] in *The Conversation*, which concluded that olive oil is one of the better options for frying foods. 

 Findings from the studies carried out for the BBC documentary, coupled with similar conclusions drawn in an article by Grootveld and colleagues in the American Oil Chemists’ Society magazine *INFORM* \[C7\], have had a sustained influence since June 2014. For example, *The Telegraph* covered the findings in two articles in November 2015, *Women’s Health* magazine \(UK\) published a related feature in 2016 and *The Times* ran similar articles in 2017, 2018 and 2019 \[C5\]. The *Telegraph* articles led to the New Zealand Heart Foundation reiterating this key message: ‘Avoid deep frying foods but if you must do so, avoid oils that are rich in polyunsaturated fats because these are unstable at high temperatures’ \[C5\]. The Australian Oilseeds Federation said Grootveld’s studies ‘vindicated the longstanding recommendations of the Australian oilseed industry that oils high in polyunsaturated fats, such as traditional sunflower and corn oil, should not be used for deep frying’ \[C5\]. 

 Grootveld’s findings on thermal stressing of different fats during deep\-frying informed a report compiled for the Healthier Catering Commitment \(HCC\) group. HCC is a London scheme and award, running across 22 boroughs in London and backed by the Greater London Authority, that supports fast\-food businesses to make their food ‘healthier’. The Greenwich representative on the HCC, writing in 2018, said Grootveld’s input had been ‘very useful to our area of work’ and confirmed that some of the HCC criteria took into account frying method and the fat/oil used to fry foods \[C8\]. The Head of Nutrition for Jamie Oliver Group consulted Grootveld in 2017 ‘to make sure that the public health message that comes across \[in Jamie Oliver’s books and TV shows\] ties in with research such as yours \[Grootveld’s\] and that we aren’t recommending anything wildly inaccurate’. She said that as a result of Grootveld’s findings she would be asking the food development team ‘to check the temperature of the frying oil and the frying time for the recipes where this is relevant’ \[C8\]. Grootveld was acknowledged in the popular 2016 cook book *River Cottage A to Z: Our Favourite Ingredients, and How to Cook Them* for his research\-based advice on cooking fats and oils. Co\-author Hugh Fearnley\-Whittingstall \[C8\] wrote: ‘His \[Grootveld’s\] research and guidance have been crucial in allowing us to navigate this complex and confusing subject and present the most up\-to\-date information, in layperson’s terms, to readers.’ Noting that Grootveld’s work continues to inform his recipe writing, including ‘invaluable input’ for his upcoming book *Eat Better Forever*, due to be published December 2020, Fearnley\-Whittingstall said the research ‘has been very instrumental in increasing my own knowledge in this area, and by extension the knowledge of my readers’.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Callender’s research triggered changes in financial support policies for part\-time undergraduates in England. Her research, charting the deleterious effects of the 2012/13 student funding reforms on the supply of, and demand for, part\-time study, raised awareness and understanding within government and beyond about the need for further reforms. It led directly to the government changing existing policies; implementing a significant new policy; and adopting an innovative policy approach – improving financial aid and facilitating greater access to part\-time study. Policymakers have benefitted from her research, alongside higher education \(HE\) institutions, HE stakeholders, and the thousands of prospective and current part\-time students now eligible for the additional financial support. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Callender remains one of very few UK academics undertaking large\-scale national quantitative studies on part\-time undergraduate education. Between 2008 and 2013, she conducted several studies which further consolidated her expertise and understanding of the part\-time landscape \(refs. 3,4,5,6\). This body of research was initiated in a different policy environment, but importantly, formulated and framed the issues affecting part\-time study. It identified: 

-  the vital social and economic benefits of part\-time study contributing to governments’ widening participation, social mobility, and national skills agendas; and 

-  the factors determining the demand for, and supply of, part\-time study, critically costs, student finances, and government funding arrangements. 

 In the REF2014, Callender submitted an impact case study. It showed how her research influenced and modified the 2012/13 student funding reforms which raised tuition but also, for the first time, introduced fee loans for part\-time undergraduates. Simultaneously, her research warned of the potentially damaging effects of these loans. 

 After REF2014, Callender monitored the 2012/13 reforms’ impact on part\-time undergraduate provision, demonstrating the failure of the new loans to stem the continuous decline in part\-time numbers. Whilst Callender’s research had predicted such outcomes, they ran contrary to policymakers’ expectations. She attributed the loans’ ineffectiveness largely to their restrictive eligibility criteria and the ‘one size fits all’ policy approach which ignored part\-timers’ distinctive characteristics when compared with full\-time students. 

 In 2017, Callender was commissioned by the Sutton Trust to undertake further interdisciplinary research to evaluate the 2012/13 reforms \(ref. 1\). Callender conducted the study between February 2017 and April 2018 with the economist John Thompson \(ex\-HEFCE head of Analytical Services\) and Callender as Principal Investigator. 

 The study entailed detailed secondary analysis of time\-series data on part\-time undergraduate UK entrants, mapping changes since 2010 \- the last year unaffected by the 2012/13 reforms. It merged two datasets: the Higher Education Statistics Agency \(HESA\) student records; and the Education and Skills Funding Agency Individualised Learner Record for further education college students. It offered greater insights than any previous analyses. 

 The research conclusively demonstrated that: 

-  Between 2010 and 2015, the number of English domiciled part\-time undergraduate entrants attending UK universities and English further education colleges halved – which when offset against the continuous rise in full\-time entrants, halted total undergraduate growth. 

-  At least 40% of this fall could be attributed to the 2012/13 reforms. 

-  Student fee loans exacerbated the decline: 

  -  most part\-time entrants were ineligible for loans because of their restrictive and inflexible eligibility criteria; and 

  -  of those eligible, 41% of part\-timers did not take out a loan compared with 6% of full\-timers, often because they were risk and debt averse. 

-  The greatest falls in entrants were among over\-35s, especially women, and those pursuing sub\-degree qualifications and short low\-intensity courses – typically vocationally orientated and ‘continuing education’ type courses. 

-  The English part\-time sector now is not only smaller but different. The 2012/13 reforms, particularly the loan system’s incentives \(favouring the take\-up and provision of three\-year full\-time undergraduate degrees aimed at school\-leavers\), narrowed the range and flexibility of part\-time provision and the characteristics of part\-time students. 

-  Government funding arrangements had hampered access, deterred participation, limited upskilling and reskilling opportunities, while undermining widening participation, social mobility and equity, and ultimately, hindering national skills development and productivity growth. 

 In sum, the research provided the evidence base for further reforming part\-time students’ finances and introducing targeted policies which acknowledge the distinctiveness of the part\-time population.

 **Details of the impact** 

 This case study shows the impact of Callender’s research on policies and debate about financial support for part\-time undergraduates. Callender drew upon her previous studies \(refs. 3,4,5,6\), and a substantive new study \(ref.1\) to raise awareness and understanding of the limitations of the 2012/13 student funding reforms for part\-time study, and of the need for further changes to reverse these reform’s unintended consequences. She disseminated her policy critique and possible solutions to policymakers, think\-tanks, HE stakeholders, and the media. Callender’s  research directly led to improved provision and greater access to part\-time study through the relaxation of the eligibility criteria for existing fee loans, the introduction of maintenance loans for part\-time students for the first time, and the development of a completely new and innovative policy approach – lifelong learning loans. Policymakers, HE stakeholders, HE Institutions, and part\-time students have all benefitted. For instance, the Treasury estimates that 150,000 undergraduates each year, enrolling in over 100 English HEIs, will be helped by the new maintenance loans. 

 **Modifying existing policies** 

 In 2012/13 the government raised part\-time undergraduate tuition fees, repaid via student fee loans, with part\-timer students qualifying for these loans for the first time. As Callender predicted, 2013 HEFCE data showed that these reforms contributed to substantial falls in part\-time enrolments in England. Callender immediately marshalled these and other data, alongside insights from her previous research \(refs. 3,4,5,6\), arguing that loans’ eligibility criteria were too restrictive, depressing demand. 

 She met David Willetts, then Minister of State for Universities and Science \(10/5/2010\-15/7/2014\), and his Special Advisor several times. Callender proposed that to improve loan take\-up, loan eligibility criteria had to change. Specifically, that loans needed to be extended to part\-time students who did not qualify for loans because they already held an Equivalent or Lower Qualification \(ELQ\). As Willetts testifies ‘ *….Callender’s research was important in helping policy\-makers understand it \[falling part\-time numbers\]….. As well as analysing the issue she also engaged with us on possible policy responses. She showed the inter\-action with the ELQ rules which meant that many mature students who already had a degree were not eligible for fee loans and were therefore particularly badly affected by the fee increase. As a result I took some steps in late 2013 to broaden the range of disciplines which were exempt from ELQ rules*. \( **source 1**\). The policy change, which extended fee loans to part\-timers wanting to take a second degree in engineering, technology, and computer science, was announced by Willetts at the Conservative Party Conference \(30/9/2013\) and came into force on 1 August 2015. 

 Callender continued gathering the mounting evidence on the deleterious impacts of the 2012/13 reforms on part\-time students and part\-time provision. To influence the policy agenda, she disseminated these findings alongside policy solutions through think\-tanks \(e.g. Higher Education Policy Institute \( **source 5**\), BrightBlue, Bridge Group\); stakeholder meetings and keynotes at UK and international stakeholder conferences \(e.g. Student Loans Company, Social Mobility Commission, Universities UK, NUS, University Alliance, Open University, Universities Association for Lifelong Learning, National Association of Student Money Advisers\) \( **source 6a,b**\); articles in the HE \(e.g. THE, WonkHE,\) and general press \(e.g. Guardian, Prospect\); media interviews **\(source 6c,e,f\);** and academic publications \( **source 6d**\). Her advice was sought, at this stage and later in the policy making process, from international and UK policy advisors. 

 Callender met Jo Johnson, then Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation \(11/5/2015\-9/01/2018\) and his team on several occasions when she demonstrated that the fall in part\-time entrants after the 2012/13 reforms represented an alarming trend. Johnson confirms the importance of Callender’s research in the area. He wanted ‘ *to introduce policy changes to mitigate this trend. Professor Callender’s research charted the problem and pointed to solutions.  It informed and influenced my Department’s thinking and led directly to two significant changes in policy’* \( **source 2**\): modifying fee loans \- an existing policy; and introducing maintenance loans \- a new policy. 

 Johnson continues *‘Firstly, Professor Callender’s research made clear that the eligibility criteria for loans needed to be broadened so more part\-time students would benefit from them. Our government used its powers to modify the loans provision and extended the ELQ exemptions.’* \( **source 2**\). On 1 August 2017, fee loans were extended to include part\-time students wishing to take a second degree in all STEM subjects. 

 **Introducing a new policy** 

 The Chancellor announced another important policy change in his 2015 Spending Review and Autumn Statement \(25/11/2015\). ‘ *Following a sharp decline in part\-time students since 2008, the government will introduce new part\-time maintenance loans from 2018\-19 to support the cost of living while studying. The government expects 150,000 part\-time students could benefit each year by the end of the Parliament*’ \(HM Treasury, Spending Review and Autumn Statement 2015, Cm 9162, para.1.183\). 

 Again Johnson, the Minister responsible, confirms the instrumental role of Callender’s research in the creation of this new policy.  ‘ *Secondly, and perhaps more significantly*, *as a result of her work on the financial pressures that act as a deterrent to the uptake of part time study, our government introduced new maintenance loans for part time students. This was an important change, not least because it attached an importance to part\-time study that had heretofore been overshadowed by the debate around the funding of full time students*.’ \( **source 2**\). This policy was introduced on 1 August 2018. 

 2017/18 HESA data show an upturn in part\-time Bachelor degree first year students for the first time since 2012/13. By 2019/20, numbers had increased by 25% from the all\-time low in 2016/17. 

 **Influencing an innovative policy approach** 

 The Post\-18 Review of Education and Funding chaired by Lord Augar, launched by the then Prime Minister Theresa May in February 2018, was tasked, *inter alia*, with encouraging more flexible learning and explicitly included part\-time study. The Department for Education \(DfE\) invited evidence from Callender to support the Review. Callender’s submission \( **source 7a**\) drew heavily on her research \(ref. 1\) as did those submitted by for instance, Birkbeck, the Open University, the University Alliance, the Nuffield Foundation, Education Policy Institute, NUS, Goldsmiths, and others. Callender called for a radical overhaul of part\-time student finances. 

 The DfE also commissioned NatCen Social Research to conduct a study for the Augar Review to assess demand for part\-time education among prospective students and how they made educational choices \( **source 7b**\). Callender was appointed the academic consultant for the study. 

 Callender continued engaging in wide ranging dissemination activities to enhance her research’s \(ref.1\) impact and to further influence the Review’s outcomes \( **source 6**\). Her 2018 study \(refs. 1, 2\) was heavily cited and utilised to inform briefings and debates in the House of Lords and the House of Commons **;** in oral and written evidence presented to and used by the House of Commons Education Select Committee, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, the Civic Universities Commission **\(source 8a,b\)** and publications from the HESA, OfS, CBI, DfE, think\-tanks \(e.g. The Resolution Foundation\) and other HE stakeholders \( **source 8c**\). Its impact is further substantiated by for instance, the Vice Chancellor of the Open University who when discussing the reach of Callender’s research asserts that it *‘has undoubtedly helped the sector, and the OU, to turn up the dial with the UK government..and press for recognition and policy changes that have so far been made’* \( **source 4a**\). 

 The Augar Report was published in May 2019 \( **source 9**\). Professor Alison Wolf, a Review member states that ‘ *Callender’s work was of great importance to the panel and the single most important source of research and policy analysis for our consideration of part\-time higher education... We found Professor Callender’s report The Lost Part\-timers...\(2018\) and the evidence she submitted to the Augar Review to be of particular value. They are cited prominently in the published report, reflecting this influence, and in particular fed directly into our headline recommendations for greater flexibility in the student loan system*’ \( **source 3**\). Specifically, Augar proposed lifelong learning loans which would replace existing loans and remove current loans’ perverse incentives by scrapping remaining ELQ restrictions and allowing loans for modular credit\-based qualifications, directly as advocated by Callender. 

  

 On 29 September 2020, the Prime Minister announced the government would introduce a flexible lifelong learning loan entitlement, as part of its lifetime skills guarantee and wider skills package. The commitment was confirmed in the government’s much delayed ‘interim conclusion’ to Augar, and in the Further Education White Paper, published on 21 January 2021, just after the REF impact deadline. Callender has been invited by the DfE to become involved in the planned consultation on the lifelong learning loan entitlement.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 15 million people in the UK live with a long\-term physical or mental health condition. Research by Professor Andy Turner and Dr Faith Martin at Coventry University led to the development of several evidence\-based face\-to\-face and digital self\-management courses including the Hope Programme. 

 A social enterprise spin\-out, Hope 4 The Community CIC was established in 2015 to further develop and commercialise the Programme, through sales of licences across public and private health sectors. Nearly 15,000 people have benefited from the Hope Programme, feeling less anxious, depressed, stressed, more activated, grateful and hopeful. Its digital delivery scaled significantly in response to the COVID\-19 pandemic.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Turner and Martin have been instrumental in conducting self\-management research which has impacted on national and international policy and practice.</ins> 

 <ins>From the 1970s, the dominant self\-management research and practice has almost exclusively focused more on a person’s pathology and skills deficit. In the early 2000s there was a call for more research into the growing concepts of positive psychology and hope in self\-management</ins> <ins>programmes</ins><ins>. A positive psychological understanding and analysis of self\-management had not yet been well\-articulated and developed. Turner and colleagues were one of the first research teams to respond to this gap by developing self\-management interventions underpinned by positive psychology theory and practice.</ins> 

 <ins>Between 2007 and 2010 Turner developed the Self\-Management For Life intervention, delivered through the Health Foundation’s Co\-Creating Health national demonstrator \[G1\]. Two papers published from the Co\-Creating Health project have shown that people living with a long\-term physical and mental health condition attending a peer and professional co\-delivered self\-management</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>reported improvements in depression and anxiety \[R1, R2\].</ins> 

 <ins>Since 2010, Turner has been working with a range of NHS and voluntary, charity and social enterprise sector \(VCSE\) partners to develop, evaluate and</ins> <ins>commercialise</ins> <ins>a range of positive psychology theory\-based self\-management interventions, called the Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 <ins>In 2014 Turner was commissioned by Macmillan Cancer Support to develop a face\-to\-face and digital Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>for people living with and affected by a range of cancers. These were the first positive psychology informed self\-management</ins> <ins>programmes</ins> <ins>for all cancer types in the UK. A pre and post\-test study, conducted between 2016\-2017 and involving 56 cancer survivors attending the digital Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins><ins>, showed that cancer survivors report improvements including fear of cancer recurrence, depression, anxiety and cancer related fatigue \[R3\]. An adapted version of the Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>was included as part of an NHS patient triggered follow\-up service delivery initiative involving 251 colorectal cancer patients. Using a prospective longitudinal design showed that the self\-management</ins> <ins>programme</ins> <ins>was found acceptable to patients, and would allow low, and some moderate risk patients to undergo five\-year surveillance without routine clinic attendance \[R4\].</ins> 

 <ins>The Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>has been successfully adapted for people living with and affected by a range of long\-term conditions. A 2013 study \[R5\] showed that for 25 people living with multiple sclerosis, the Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>led to improved scores in several outcome measures including distress, mood, fatigue and self\-efficacy.</ins> 

 <ins>Additionally, Turner was commissioned by</ins> <ins>Carers</ins> <ins>Trust Heart of England to develop and evaluate a Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>for parents of autistic children, where there is currently no UK evidence base for interventions for support. In 2018 a study involving 101 parents indicated improvements in depression, anxiety, and positive mental wellbeing. Changes in positive psychological constructs, namely gratitude and hope, predicted improvements in depression \[R6\].</ins> 

 <ins>Extending the research internationally, in 2018, Turner and collaborators from McMaster University in Canada secured $500k grant from Ontario Health Technology Fund to adapt the Hope</ins> <ins>Programme</ins> <ins>for an international</ins> <ins>randomised</ins> <ins>controlled trial investigating automated remote monitoring and self\-management support among cardiac and vascular patients \[G2\]. This trial is ongoing</ins><ins>.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Millions of people with long\-term conditions feel unable to take an active role in their own care resulting in high use of health services. In response to this need, Turner and Martin developed a range of self\-management interventions building on the Hope Programme, a six\-week intervention co\-created to build knowledge, skills and confidence in self\-management of health and wellbeing \(activation\). Co\-delivered by peer volunteers and healthcare professionals, it uses evidence\-based activities including goal\-setting, gratitude diaries, and activity\-scheduling. 

 Impacts include: 

 1\) A novel social enterprise; 

 2\) Partnership\-working to improve patient activation, mental wellbeing and quality of life; 

 3\) Informing national and international policy; 

 4\) Improving wellbeing through creative arts; 

 5\) Enabling digital support during COVID\-19. 

 1\) <ins>Novel Social Enterprise</ins> 

 CU’s only social enterprise spin\-out Hope For The Community CIC \(H4C\) was founded in 2015 by Turner and four volunteer service users. In 2017, CU granted a licence to H4C to use and further develop Turner and Martin’s research for patient and societal benefit. The social enterprise has been transformational in scaling delivery of the Hope Programme, benefitting thousands nationwide. 

 From 2017\-2020 H4C co\-created seven Hope Programme interventions, licenced to public, private and voluntary sector organisations, generating income totalling £715K and re\-investing £20k of profit into its social mission. H4C employs four full\-time core staff and 20 consultants, students and volunteers \[S1\] and it was named in the UK’s top 25 social enterprises in NatWest SE100 ‘Trailblazing Newcomers’ Index \[S2\]. 

 2\) <ins>Partnerships for Patient Activation, Mental Wellbeing and Quality of Life</ins> 

 The Hope Programme has reached nearly 15,000 people to date. 

 Macmillan Cancer Support have licenced the Hope Programme since 2015, providing life\-changing benefits for people living with cancer and becoming a core service offer in 106 cancer centres across the UK. To date, 10,844 cancer survivors have attended the Hope Programme, with 1,066 volunteer and professional facilitators trained. Macmillan’s post\-programme evaluation established that 43% participants felt more confident to self\-manage, 46% felt their quality of life improved, and 56% felt less isolated \[S3\]. 

 Funded by The National Lottery Community Fund \(2016\), Bethany’s Wish \(2017\), EU’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme \(2018\), Children Cancer Leukaemia Group and Carers Trust \(2020\), H4C trained parent volunteers to deliver 46 Hope Programme interventions to 1,132 parents of autistic children and children with cancer \[S4\]. Our research has shown parents report significant improvements in depression \(68%\) anxiety \(40%\) positive mental wellbeing \(30%\) hope \(42%\) and gratitude \(21%\) \[R6\]. 

 In 2017, NHS England commissioned the Hope Programme to develop a new model of care for people with chronic illness across Devon. 106 volunteer and professional facilitators were trained and 107 courses delivered to 1,364 people, with post\-programme evaluations demonstrating participants were more activated and experiences improved mental wellbeing, reducing health service usage. In 2020, the programme was extended across the whole of the South West region as part of the NHS Long\-term plan implementation \[S5\]. 

 “The evidence\-base helps stamp a seal of academic rigour, authenticity and confidence in the efficacy of the programme. The public need little persuading that the Hope Programme is highly valuable.” — Head of Personalised Care, Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust \[S5\] 

 3\) <ins>National and International Policy</ins> 

 Turner’s research on self\-management informed a report on the 'Future of an ageing population' for the UK Government Office for Science \[S7\]. It has also informed the embedding of positive psychological theory and practice into design of self\-management interventions used by the NHS, forming the basis of several evidence\-based programmes in England \[S6\]. 

 In 2017 The National Academies of Science Technology and Engineering undertook a review entitled ‘Pain Management and the Opioid Epidemic: Balancing Societal and Individual Benefits and Risks of Prescription Opioid Use’, and used work by Turner to support self\-management techniques as alternative non\-pharmaceutical methods for pain management \[S8, p.91\]. 

 4\) <ins>Wellbeing through Creative Arts</ins> 

 H4C re\-invests profits into the community by funding events connecting research and arts for wellbeing. In the lead up to Coventry City of Culture 2021, H4C developed an award\-winning Gratitude Wall community art project \[S1\] bringing Turner’s research on benefits of gratitude to public. A large chalkboard Gratitude Wall toured 60 events collecting over 12,000 expressions of gratitude, boosting people’s happiness. It featured in the 2018 Universities UK \#MadeatUni campaign, bringing to life the impact of universities on communities \[S9\]. At another event a Writing Gym brought parents of autistic children together to express the emotional challenges they face through art and drama, with participants reporting increased relaxation and optimism as a result \[S1\]. 

  

 5\) <ins>Rapid COVID\-19 Response</ins> 

 COVID\-19 increased depression, anxiety and isolation for people with long\-term conditions, so in response Turner and Martin developed new research\-informed resources. H4C rapidly scaled its digital Hope Programme to provide innovative wellbeing support to 1,500 people between March and December 2020, who otherwise would not have received it. A new intervention for carers funded by Coventry City Council was co\-created, and delivery models facilitating use of VR headsets and online/offline were trialled to offer choice and accessibility. H4C’s work was identified by the West Midlands Combined Authority as a case study for excellent ‘innovation, enterprise and flexibility’ in response to COVID\-19 \[S10, pp.42\-45\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our work has **improved care for people with Parkinson’s disease \(PD\)**, an incurable neurological condition that is affecting an increasing number of people. Specifically, we have: 

1.  **Changed UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) and Canadian guidelines for the treatment of PD**. Levodopa is now recommended as initial therapy, subthalamic deep brain stimulation \(DBS\) is advised for people with advanced disease, and provision of physiotherapy and occupational therapy in early disease is downgraded. 

1.  **Changed care practices** such that levodopa is used as first line therapy in 90% of UK patients compared to 75% in 2013 and the number of patients with advanced disease who receive DBS has increased by 27%. These changes will substantially improve patient outcomes and have resulted in **decreased NHS treatment costs.** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Parkinson’s disease \(PD\)** is an incurable neurological condition affecting 2% of men and 1.3% of women, with numbers expected to double by 2050 as the population ages. PD results from the loss of nerves in the brain that produce **dopamine**. Initial symptoms include tremor, slowness, stiffness, and fine movement difficulties, but over 10 to 20 years it progresses to imbalance, resulting in falls/fractures, and non\-movement complications of dementia, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. No therapies are available to stop disease progression and treatment is limited to improving symptoms using dopaminergic agents including the dopamine precursor, **levodopa**, **dopamine agonists** that mimic dopamine’s effects, or enzyme inhibitors such as **monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors \(MAOBI\)** that stop dopamine breakdown in the brain. Later in the disease, patients less than 70 years with no dementia or depression may benefit from **subthalamic deep brain stimulation surgery \(DBS\)** as well as rehabilitation therapies including **physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy**. However, the optimal combination of treatments for particular patients at different disease stages is still unknown. 

 Levodopa has been the main initial treatment for PD for many years but prolonged use leads to involuntary movements \(dyskinesia\) and a shorter duration of response. To delay the use of levodopa, dopamine agonists and MAOBIs were proposed for initial treatment. However, this approach had not undergone clinical assessment and is more costly. Furthermore, the roles of DBS and rehabilitation therapies were uncertain. 

 In order to provide evidence for the optimal clinical management of patients with PD, Professor Clarke at the University of Birmingham \(UoB\) led a large portfolio of work assessing drug, surgical, and rehabilitation therapies to identify the most suitable and cost\-effective treatment and management strategies for PD patients. This has produced 3 Key Findings \[KF1–KF3\] that have informed directly on the development of the optimal PD patient pathway. 

 <ins> **Establishing appropriate drug treatment pathways for patients with Parkinson’s disease**</ins> 

 An analysis of available evidence by Clarke and the UoB Clinical Trials Unit \(BCTU\) \[R1\], identified that it was unclear which drugs were the most suitable for early and later stages of PD. Therefore, the team established **PD MED**, a large, long\-term comparative trial designed to assess the risks versus benefits of initially treating PD patients with dopamine agonists and MAOBI compared to levodopa. Between 2000 and 2009, 1,620 patients were allocated to levodopa, dopamine agonist, or MAOBI therapy and their quality of life assessed during follow\-up for at least 10 years until trial closure in 2019. An interim analysis in 2014 \[R2\] showed **a significant benefit in quality of life for patients initiated on levodopa compared to levodopa\-sparing therapies \[KF1\]**, indicated by a higher mobility score \(PDQ\-39\) and higher overall health assessment score \(EQ\-5D\) in levodopa\-treated patients **.** Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was also significantly less common in levodopa patients whilst indicators of disease progression did not differ between the groups. 

 <ins> **Assessing the relative effectiveness of surgery for Parkinson’s disease**</ins> 

 Through a systematic review of PD surgery trials since 1990 \[R3\], Clarke and BCTU identified the need for much larger, randomised controlled trials \(RCT\) to assess the cost\-effectiveness and long\-term effects of surgery on patient\-rated quality of life. To do this they conducted **PD SURG** \[R4\], the largest RCT of surgery in PD. 366 patients with advanced PD were randomised to DBS surgery with best medical therapy \(BMT\) or BMT alone. At 1 year, the combination of **surgery and BMT improved quality of life for patients with advanced PD compared to BMT alone \[KF2\]**, indicated by significantly higher mobility scores \(PDQ\-39\) in the surgery group. 

 <ins> **Assessing the effectiveness of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy in Parkinson’s Disease**</ins> 

 The team carried out a systematic review of the effectiveness of physiotherapy in PD. This showed that although there was evidence of short\-term symptomatic relief, the effect of physiotherapy on a patient’s quality of life was unclear, and there was no evidence of cost\-effectiveness \[R5\]. This highlighted a need for a large RCT with improved methodology and reporting to assess the cost\-effectiveness of physiotherapy and its effect on QoL in the longer\-term. **PD REHAB** \[R6\] was the largest rehabilitation trial ever performed in PD. 762 patients with mild to moderate PD were randomised to receive either immediate physiotherapy and occupational therapy or therapy deferred for 12 months. **Therapy had no effect on patient\-rated quality of life at 12 months \[KF3\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We have **improved care for people with early and advanced Parkinson’s disease \(PD\)** by defining a first line drug that improves the mobility and overall health of patients with early PD, demonstrating that surgical intervention can improve mobility for patients with advanced disease and downgrading guidance on use of rehabilitation therapies in early PD. We have achieved this through: \(1\) **changing national guidelines for PD in the UK and Canada** and by \(2\) **changing practitioner best practice**. As a result of these changes in therapy, **NHS treatment costs for PD patients have been reduced**. 

 **1. <ins>UK and Canadian guidelines for PD have changed resulting in improved care practices for patients**</ins> 

 In 2017, the **UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines for the treatment of PD** were **changed**. The key findings \[KF1, KF2, KF3\] from UoB trials were instrumental in underpinning many of these changes \[S1\]. NICE now recommends that clinicians: 

1.  “Offer levodopa to people in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease whose motor symptoms impact on their quality of life.” \[S1. Recommendation 26. p. 74; from KF1\]. 

1.  “Consider deep brain stimulation for people with advanced Parkinson’s disease whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by best medical therapy.” \[S1. Recommendation 89. p. 215; from KF2\]. 

1.  “Consider referring people who are in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease to 

  1.  a physiotherapist with experience of Parkinson’s disease for assessment, education and advice, including information about physical activity.” \[S1. Recommendation 69. p. 161; from KF3\]. 

  1.  an occupational therapist with experience of Parkinson’s disease for assessment, education and advice on motor and non\-motor symptoms.” \[S1. Recommendation 72. p. 168; from KF3\]. 

 Prior to 2017, NICE did not specify which therapy to use as the first line treatment for PD patients with early disease. The Guideline Development Group \(GDG\) stated that when reaching their decision to recommend offering levodopa \(Recommendation 26\), they gave particular attention to KF1 from PD MED as “it was a long\-term independently\-funded study conducted in the UK” \[S1. p. 64\]. Similarly, PD SURG \[R4\] contributed significantly to NICE decisions regarding surgery guidelines as it was 1 of only 4 surgical studies considered \[S1. p. 200\]. UoB was also asked to provide additional data from PD SURG beyond the 1\-year follow up reported in R4, which were used, along with R4, to determine guidance on use of surgery for early \[S1. p. 217\] and advanced PD \[S1. p. 201\] as well as to assess the cost–utility of surgery \[S1. p. 204–5\], which is an important factor in governing recommendation changes. UoB’s Professor Adrian Williams and Dr Caroline Rick, who had been involved in the design and conduct of PD SURG, were also invited as ‘Expert Witnesses’ to answer questions about the trial to assist the GDG in their review of evidence for DBS and subsequent decision to recommend DBS \[S1. p. 198\]. The provision of individual patient data from the PD SURG trial allowed NICE to perform their own health economics analysis which found the provision of DBS favourable. 

 PD REHAB \[R6\] was also deemed “of particular importance” by the GDG, as it was “a large, recent UK\-based study” \[S1. p. 159\]. Based on KF3, NICE changed the 2006 guidance that physiotherapy and occupational therapy *should* be available to people with PD \(CG35\), to instead advise clinicians to ‘ *consider*’ rather than ‘ *recommend*’ physiotherapy and occupational therapy and stated that if offered, therapy should be given by therapists with experience of PD. 

 These UoB\-driven changes to the NICE guidelines have been acknowledged as life changing for PD patients, as stated by the CEO for Parkinson’s UK, the world’s largest patient\-led organisation for PD. Patients believe that through the changes to NICE guidelines in response to Birmingham’s research: “the quality of care for everyone affected by Parkinson’s disease in the UK has improved.” \[S2\] 

 The 2017 NICE guidelines \[S1\] have also underpinned subsequent **changes to guidelines in Canada** \[S3 Ref 103\], providing downstream impact of the influence of our research \[KF1–KF3\] in the UK. In 2019, the Canadian Guidelines for PD were modified to recommend that: 

1.  “Levodopa may be used as a symptomatic treatment for people with early Parkinson disease \(Grade A\).” \[S3. Recommendation C31; from KF1\]. 

1.  “Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or the globus pallidus interna is effective against motor fluctuations and dyskinesia \(grade A\).” \[S3. Recommendation C49; from KF2\]. 

1.  “Consideration should be given to referring people who are in the early stages of Parkinson disease to: 

 \(1\) a physiotherapist with experience of the disease for assessment, education and advice, including information about physical activity \(grade B\).” \[S3. Recommendation C56; from KF3\]. 

 \(2\) an occupational therapist with experience of Parkinson disease for assessment, education and advice on motor and nonmotor symptoms \(grade B\).” \[S3. Recommendation C58; from KF3\]. 

 **2. <ins>Care practices for PD patients have changed, resulting in cost savings to the NHS**</ins> 

 **Use of levodopa as first line treatment for PD patients in the UK has increased**. During this REF period, the use of levodopa has increased by 11.5% from 78.5% in 2013 to 90% in 2019, whilst the combined use of dopamine agonists and MAOBIs has decreased by 12% \[S4\]. Based on national estimates for new incident PD patients \(18,461 in 2018\), this means that 2,210 more PD patients are now treated initially with levodopa each year compared to in 2013 and should experience the improved quality of life that comes with this treatment. KF1 clearly drove these changes in treatment since use of levodopa first started to increase when Clarke first disseminated the results of PD MED at congress meetings around 2011 \[S5\]. Subsequently, during this REF period, publication of KF1 in 2014 \[R2\] and its incorporation in NICE guidelines in 2017 \[S1\] has supported a continuing rise in use of levodopa, which has increased by 7.5% since 2014, as in the year following each landmark, the percentage of PD patients in the UK who received levodopa increased. 

 International **clinician awareness of levodopa as the best initial treatment for PD patients has been raised**, through its inclusion in 2016 in Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice \[S6\] — the main US textbook on Neurology — and by its inclusion along with KF2 and KF3 in the Birmingham Movement Disorders Course \[S7\] that is held bi\-annually for 200 international specialist registrars in neurology and geriatrics. 

 **Use of Deep Brain Stimulation surgery for patients with advanced PD has increased**. More than 200 patients in the UK now receive DBS each year — an increase of 44% compared with 2013/2014. This increase in DBS was driven directly by KF2 and DBS usage has doubled since publication of PD SURG in 2010. It would be expected that this change in practice would substantially improve quality of life and mobility for these patients \[S8\]. 

 Taken together, these research\-led changes in treatment practice have also resulted in **reduced treatment costs** **for PD patients, resulting in savings for the NHS**. This is demonstrated by a cost\-effectiveness analysis of PD MED which showed that initial treatment with levodopa, instead of levodopa\-sparing therapies, would save the NHS an average of £3,390 per patient over 4 years \[S9\]. Based on 2,120 more PD patients now receiving levodopa as initial treatment each year, this represents an annual saving of £1.8m for the NHS \[S7\]. Furthermore, extrapolation of the PD SURG data, combined with assumptions concerning future costs and Quality Associated Life Years, suggests that use of deep brain stimulation surgery would be **cost\-effective for the NHS** over 5 years \[S10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Sustained research excellence in tomato fruit ripening at the University of Nottingham \(UoN\) has underpinned a change in Syngenta’s tomato breeding strategy. Syngenta, a leading global agriculture company who supply one in five of all tomato seeds worldwide, has adopted UoN technology to address the challenge of extending shelf life of commercial \(retail\) tomatoes. UoN\-Syngenta research collaborations led to the discovery of two novel genomic regions \(QTLs\) that control fruit softening, independent of other ripening processes that control colour and flavour. The QTLs were patent protected and deployed in Syngenta’s commercial tomato breeding programme. Compared to current solutions on the market, such as the ripening inhibitor \(rin\) that has a detrimental effect on taste, the QTLs provide superior tomato shelf life at the same time as enhancing consumer satisfaction. \[redacted\].

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Tomato is the fourth most important vegetable crop, with 241,928,300t produced globally in 2017 \(Food and Agriculture Organization\). Thousands of varieties are grown worldwide and, since 1990, breeders have used natural slow ripening mutations to modulate the fruit ripening process and give commercial varieties an extended shelf life that is vital for fresh food supply chains. However, current state\-of\-the\-art slow ripening mutations, such as the ripening inhibitor \(rin\), affect the entire ripening process and have a detrimental effect on fruit colour and flavour. Hence, **a major goal of breeders such as Syngenta has been to identify novel genes that exclusively control tomato fruit softening**, allowing a long shelf life, but normal colour and flavour development of the fruit. The achievement of this goal has been expedited by the availability of the tomato genome sequence and discovery of genes controlling softening by Professor Seymour’s team. 

 The tomato genome was sequenced by the Tomato Genome Consortium, a multi\-national team of over 300 scientists from 14 countries. Professor Seymour spearheaded the UK contribution to the sequencing programme and worked closely with collaborators at Imperial College, James Hutton and the Sanger Institute to plan and deliver the BBSRC funded UK component of the programme **\(G1\)**. The tomato genome sequence, published in 2012 **\(1\)**, provided detailed information about the functional portions of the genome, revealing the order, orientation, type and relative position of all 35,000 genes. Specific work undertaken at UoN identified genes involved in cell wall remodelling in ripening tomato fruits that were good candidates for controlling fruit softening including 53 genes that were predominantly expressed in fruit tissue **\(1: supplementary information, table 12\)**. Some genes showed a dramatic increase in expression from the onset of fruit ripening including a member of the pectate lyase \(PL\) gene family \(Solyc03g111690\) **\(1: supplementary information, section 5.7\)**. 

 In collaboration with Syngenta, the tomato genome sequence was used in research to identify genomic regions \(quantitative trait loci or QTLs\) and genes that exclusively control tomato fruit softening. The research was funded via BBSRC industry collaboration schemes **\(G2,G3\)** and leveraged Syngenta’s next generation sequencing platform, other in\-house technologies and expertise. The research utilised two approaches: \(i\) a wild type *Solanum pennellii* tomato mapping population was used to identify genomic regions and genes associated with natural variation in fruit texture; \(ii\) targeted transgenic experiments were used to understand the role of candidate genes in fruit ripening. 

 Initial outcomes of the work identified a genomic region \(QTL\) on chromosome 2 associated with natural variation in fruit texture. The region contained cell wall structure genes \(all encoding pectin methylesterases\) and a ripening related gene \(ethylene response factor\) **\(2\)**. The discovery provided new insights in the genetic basis of ripening and led to a patent application in 2011. The patent, filed jointly by Syngenta and UoN, protected the use of specific genetic markers on chromosome 2 for use in breeding tomatoes with increased firmness **\(I1\)**. The patent was granted in the US in 2015 and elsewhere in 2016. 

 Using the *Solanum pennellii* tomato mapping population, a further fruit firmness QTL was identified on chromosome 3 that was more strongly associated with natural variation in fruit texture. This research also reported the variation in fruit firmness was strongly associated with a pectate lyase \(PL\) gene Solyc03g111690 located within this chromosome 3 genomic region **\(3\)**. This PL gene was highly expressed during ripening. Gene silencing experiments showed that this gene increased fruit firmness without affecting other traits such as yield, colour, sugars, acids and other fruit metabolites. Furthermore, fruits retained their integrity following storage for 14 days at room temperature which indicated the gene had practical application in improving shelf life **\(3\)**. The intellectual property was protected by a joint Syngenta and UoN patent filed in 2013. The patent protected use of the genetic region on chromosome 3 containing PL and was granted in the USA \(2017\) and Europe \(2019\) **\(I2\)**. 

 The research **\(3\)** was an important breakthrough, as it reported for the first time substantial and specific control over tomato softening during the ripening process. It offered a commercial approach for extending tomato shelf life that exploited natural variation in pectate lyase within wild type tomatoes to produce new varieties by conventional, non\-genetically modified \(non\-GM\), breeding approaches. In recognition of excellence in UK government funded research, the outcomes of the research were featured on the BBSRC website. The work was also reported globally in mainstream, industry and subject specific news outlets including  [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gmo-tomatoes-may-stay-firm-longer-1469458926) \(USA\),  [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3707182/Salad-days-Tomato-never-goes-soft-stay-fresher-longer-British-scientists-turn-gene-makes-fruit-decay.html?ito=email_share_article-top) \(UK\) and BBC Farming Today \(UK\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Syngenta are a leading global agriculture company with a vegetable seed business of USD621,000,000 \( [Syngenta Financial Report 2019](https://www.syngenta.com/sites/syngenta/files/bond-investor-information/Financial-Report-2019_0.pdf)\). **Syngenta supply one in five of all tomato seed varieties globally** making the tomato of significant value to the company \[redacted\]. Syngenta’s new tomato variety breeding priorities have a major focus on traits that will reduce waste along the food chain and the company has sought new ways to extend post\-harvest shelf life in tomato while maintaining excellent fruit quality. **Working with University of Nottingham \(UoN\), Syngenta have identified, patented and deployed two novel genomic regions \(QTLs\)** **within their tomato breeding programme.** Compared to current solutions on the market, such as the ripening inhibitor \(rin\) that has a detrimental effect on taste, these novel QTL deployment approaches provide superior tomato shelf life and flavour attributes and have **driven change in Syngenta’s tomato breeding programme strategy**. 

 <ins> **G</ins><ins>enome sequence improves Syngenta’s</ins> <ins>tomato R&D**</ins> 

 The tomato genome sequence **\(1\)** has improved Syngenta’s tomato research and development operations. It provides the reference genome sequence for comparison of novel germplasm, such as wild tomato species, for Syngenta’s new trait discovery platform. The genome sequence has also allowed Syngenta to understand the position of all tomato genes relative to their proprietary breeding markers **\(a\)**. This has enabled Syngenta’s breeding team to precisely understand the position of recombination events relative to genes and improve the accuracy of the tomato breeding process. Syngenta have used the genome sequence as part of their new trait discovery platform to identify and convert many elite lines for 50\+ genetic loci responsible for a wide range of important agronomic characteristics **\(a\)**. These include genes affecting disease resistance, vigour and fruit quality characteristics such as sugar content, colour, and, working with researchers at UoN, genes involved in controlling post\-harvest quality. Syngenta’s Head of Global Seeds Development Traits and Regulatory stated “ *the publicly available \[tomato genome\] sequence complements our own genomic resources and has **proved an important resource for our breeding programme**” **\(a\)**.

 Through working in close collaboration with UoN across 14 years, a period that spans the current REF period, Syngenta has been able to innovate within their tomato pre\-breeding R&D pipeline. Significant UoN\-Syngenta collaborative research projects were funded under BBSRC IPA and LINK industry schemes **\(G2,G3\)** which benefitted from \[redacted\] investment from Syngenta **\(b\)**. Both BBSRC projects delivered on the planned research and commercial objectives, providing Syngenta with two novel genomic regions \(QTLs\) on chromosomes 2 and 3 that could exclusively control fruit softening during the fruit ripening process **\(2,3\)**. The novel genetic material was protected by joint Syngenta and UoN patents, allowing Syngenta to establish an IP proprietary position in the USA and Europe for ‘Firmness Tomato 1’ technology \(QTL2\) and in multiple countries \(Australia, Canada, Europe, Israel, Korea, Morocco, Mexico and USA\) for the ‘Firmness Tomato 2’ technology \(QTL3, includes the gene pectate lyase\) **\(I1,I2,a\)**. Syngenta has invested \[redacted\] to maintain their IP position in the territories stated. Furthermore, **Syngenta is progressing the technologies in their commercial tomato breeding programme and is offering the technologies as licence options to competitor tomato breeding companies** on its proprietary licensing platform  [Traitability](https://www.traitability.com/products/search/simple-product) **\(a,c\)**. Syngenta’s Head of Global Seeds Development Traits and Regulatory described identification of the novel genetic material a ‘ *major step forward as previous technologies that extended shelf life had detrimental effects on other quality characteristics*’ and stated ‘ *only a small number of projects based on our university collaborations result in the discovery of gene loci that have a likely significant commercial benefit*’ **\(a\)**.

 Research completed under the collaborative BBSRC projects showed the expression of candidate fruit softening genes within the QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 3 was lower in *Solanum pennellii* wild type tomato compared to commercial control varieties **\(2,3\)**. This provided Syngenta the opportunity to manipulate the expression of candidate fruit softening genes and develop new commercial varieties by using wild type tomatoes \(donor material\) containing the QTLs of interest using conventional \(non\-GM\) breeding approaches. The process of breeding new tomato varieties through conventional breeding approaches, from gene identification to availability of commercial seed, normally takes approximately 10 years depending on complexity of the target QTLs. In **2013**, Syngenta deployed the genetic material into their tomato breeding programme and have achieved excellent results to date. 

 Donor material containing the QTLs of interest were used to initiate backcross programs in Syngenta’s nursery in Morocco \(2013\). For both QTL2 and QTL3, five elite breeding lines were converted over several generations across a 4 year timeline \(2013\-2017\). The resulting converted materials were trialled during two seasons per year in a passive plastic house environment for three years in Syngenta’s breeding station in Spain \(2017\-2020\). The fruit were phenotyped for quality traits \(texture, shelf life, sugar content, size and shape\) across three harvests per season at Syngenta’s fruit quality laboratories in Spain. Post\-harvest quality traits were also measured \(firmness during storage for ten days\). Commenting on these traits Syngenta stated that ‘ **Substantial improvements in fruit firmness and shelf life** while maintaining excellent colour and eating quality have been obtained in various genetic backgrounds with QTL3’  \(a\)**. This outcome **confirmed the rationale for the change in Syngenta’s breeding strategy** \[redacted\]. Syngenta stated ‘ *The long term nature of the work is a normal factor in any crop breeding programme*’ **\(a\)**. 

 Between 2013 and 2020 **Syngenta invested a total of** \[redacted\] **in the validation and deployment of both QTL’s into their tomato breeding programme \(a\)**. This is \[redacted\] of their tomato output trait programme budget, indicating sustained investment by the company into the commercialisation of UoN technology. Syngenta’s Head of Global Seeds Development Traits and Regulatory stated ‘ **adopting the UoN technology into our breeding programme has been a priority in our tomato fruit quality division** and the technology is a standing item on the agenda of Syngenta Tomato Breeders Meetings*’ **\(a\)**. 

 \[redacted\] 

 <ins> **Summary**</ins> 

 Acknowledging the importance of the tomato genome sequence in development of new varieties and UoN’s contribution to innovation within Syngenta’s shelf\-life programme, Syngenta’s Head of Global Seeds Development Traits and Regulatory stated: 

 *“Professor Seymour has been instrumental in understanding the value of the tomato genome sequence to discover novel loci controlling fruit shelf life and delivering this important resource to a global tomato breeding company. Professor Seymour's \[2016 **\(3\)**\] discovery has provided the first real opportunity to enhance tomato shelf life while maintaining excellent flavour. This is important because at present combining long shelf life and optimal eating characteristics have proved a significant challenge. This work is a direct result of our long\-standing and fruitful partnership with the University of Nottingham, which has been sustained by Professor Seymour’s collaborative approach”* **\(a\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the UK; 40,000 new cases and nearly 12,000 deaths estimated per year.  Research at QUB has led and contributed to the following significant impacts: 

-  Contribution to the registration trial for the **first FDA\-approved alpha particle** Radium\-223 \(Xofigo ®\); resulting in **prolonged overall survival** and **improved quality of life** for men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer \(mCRPC\). Xofigo was licensed in 2013 **;** 

-  Access for prostate cancer patients to advanced radiotherapies \(within trials\) and subsequent **introduction as standard care** to the Northern Ireland Health Service *i.e.,* SPORT and CHHiP 

-  **Influencing treatment guidelines** *i.e.,* European Society of Urology; European Society for Medical Oncology; Irish National Cancer Strategy and NICE 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In NI there are approximately 1,200 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed annually, of which 25% will die of metastatic disease. In response to this, Professor O’Sullivan \(JOS\), who has a joint appointment as Professor of Radiation Oncology at Queen’s and was Director of Oncology at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust \(between 2014 and 2017\), established the **Advanced Radiotherapy Group \(ARG\)** in 2004. This QUB\-affiliated multidisciplinary group \(including clinicians, nurses, laboratory scientists, radiophysicists and clinical trial specialists\) aims to improve clinical outcomes for patients and is embedded in the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre. The ARG’s research capabilities have been strengthened by additional clinical academic colleagues including Professor Suneil Jain \(SJ\) who is also a Senior Oncologist in the Cancer Centre. The ARG focusses on clinical trials of novel therapeutics in metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer \(mCRPC\) and its precursor, metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer \(mHSPC\), as well as advanced radiotherapy in localised prostate cancer. 

 **Clinical Trials of Radionuclide therapies** 

 While treatment outcomes have improved significantly for localised prostate cancer, mCRPC remains a fatal condition responsible for the deaths of more than 11,000 men every year in the UK.  Traditional chemotherapy treatments are not always effective in treating aggressive and advanced forms of prostate cancer, and mCRPC does not respond to castration therapy. The ARG’s radionuclide therapy research, led by JOS, aims to treat mCRPC and has focused on two radiopharmaceuticals: Rhenium\-186\-HEDP and Radium\-223 dichloride \(Ra\-223\). 

 **Rhenium\-186 HEDP** 

 The TAXIUM 1 trial \(CI: JOS\) was an international \(UK and Netherlands\) phase 1/2 trial which demonstrated tolerability and safety of a bone seeking beta radionuclide, Rhenium\-186 hydroxyethyledine diphosphonate \(Re\-186 HEDP\), combined with Docetaxel chemotherapy **\[R1\]**. A follow\-on randomised trial, TAXIUM 2 \(CI JOS\), demonstrated no survival benefit for the combination and therefore did not progress further. 

 **Radium\-223 \(Xofigo®\)** 

 Due to the ARG’s experience in delivering TAXIUM 1 clinical trial, JOS was selected by the pharmaceutical company Algeta to be a local Principal Investigator in the phase 2 study \(BC\-104\) of Ra\-223 **\[R2\]**. Ra\-223 \(brand name **Xofigo®**\) was proposed as novel alpha radionuclide treatment. Ra\-223 is a “calcium mimetic” that, like calcium, accumulates preferentially in areas of bone that are undergoing increased turnover. The alpha particles have a narrow emission range \(around 2\-10 cell diameters\) compared to beta particles, limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissues. 

 The phase 3 ALSYMPCA trial which demonstrated improved overall survival compared with placebo \(14.0 months and 11.2 months, respectively\) regardless of previous docetaxel\-based chemotherapy use **\[R3\]**. This was the first radionuclide therapy to demonstrate survival benefit in a metastatic cancer of any type. JOS was CI on an International phase 4 trial \(iEAP\) of Ra\-223 which suggested potential benefit of combination of Radium with Enzalutamide **\[R4\]**. 

 **Clinical Trials of External Beam Radiotherapy** 

 The ARG have made significant contributions to the development of radiotherapy technologies which have facilitated early adoption in the NHS in Northern Ireland, resulting in improved cure rates, reduced toxicity, and increased efficiency of radical radiotherapy. 

 CHHiP and CHHiP\-IGRT Trials demonstrated equivalence of Hypofractionated radiotherapy \(the delivery of fewer, larger doses of radiotherapy and for improving dose intensity\) in localised prostate cancer using Intensity Modulated radiotherapy, IMRT \(high\-precision radiotherapy that uses computer\-controlled linear accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to specific areas within the tumour\) and Image\-Guided Radiotherapy, IGRT \(use of imaging during radiation therapy to improve the precision and accuracy of treatment delivery\) **\[R5\]**. 

 The ‘SPORT trial’ \(A Study Evaluating Stereotactic Prostate Radiotherapy in High\-Risk Localised Prostate Cancer\), led by Professor Jain, was the first if its kind in the UK to use ‘SABR’ \(Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy\) to target tumours and deliver large doses per treatment, providing an opportunity for dose escalation beyond that achievable with conventional radiotherapy and allowing men to have their full course of radiotherapy in only five hospital visits instead of the typical 37. In addition, patients in the study were treated with SpaceOAR, a minimally invasive hydrogel technology, inserted prior to radiotherapy treatment which has been shown to significantly decrease unwanted radiotherapy side effects for patients **\[R6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Prostate cancer affects **1 in 9** **men** in the UK, approximately 25% of whom will die from metastatic prostate cancer. Research from the ARG has meant that patients can benefit from participation in clinical trials. Those not involved in trials have benefitted from access to treatments that were not available as part of standard care. The research has also influenced clinical guidelines \(locally and globally\) and resulted in commercial impact through the development of Ra\-223 treatment \(Xofigo®\). 

 **Improving safety, efficacy, and efficiency of advanced radiotherapy in prostate cancer** 

 The TAXIUM 1\+2 trials \(JOS \-CI\) demonstrated tolerability of Re\-186 HEDP with Docetaxel, however there was no benefit on overall survival and this research strategy was discontinued, therefore averting further investment, and allowing full focus on Ra\-223 a treatment for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. 

 The phase 2 \(BC1\-04\) and phase 3 trials \(ALSYMPCA\) helped to determine the **safety profile** and **efficacy** of Ra\-223 and were instrumental in the regulatory approval by **FDA** \(May 2013\) and **EMA** \(September 2013\). Ra\-223 therapy was marketed as Xofigo®. The FDA reviewed Xofigo® under the agency’s **priority review programme** and is the **first alpha radionuclide therapy** to be approved by the FDA **\[S1\]**. Following licensing of Xofigo, it was approved by NICE for treatment in the UK **\[S2\].** 

 **Introduction of advanced radiotherapies into clinical practice in Northern Ireland** 

 Radiotherapies that have been introduced as a result of clinical trials include Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy \(IMRT\) and Image\-guided radiotherapy \(IGRT\). The table below demonstrates the increase in delivery of advanced radiotherapies in Belfast, the primary treatment centre for cancer patients from across Northern Ireland. 

 Ra\-223 was introduced in 2006 as part of BC1\-04 trial followed by ALSYMPCA in 2008. The drug was licensed in 2014 and NICE approved in 2016. Numbers decreased as a result of new toxicity data from ERA\-223 trial in 2018. At the peak, almost 300 treatments per year were administered in Belfast. 

| **Year** | **IMRT** | **Stereotactic radiotherapy** | **Ra\-223 treatment  trials and non\-trials\)** | **Ra\-223 treatment  non\-trials** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2013 | 375 | 8 | 45 | \- |
| 2014 | 622 | 22 | 5 | 4 |
| 2015 | 795 | 30 | 15 | 15 |
| 2016 | 908 | 54 | 230 | 185 |
| 2017 | 932 | 62 | 276 | 185 |
| 2018 | 1289 | 110 | 168 | 141 |
| 2019 | 1572 | 98 | 96 | 78 |
| 2020 | 2389 | 114 | 64 | 64 |

 IMRT was introduced as part of the CHHiP trial in 2008. There has been steady increase in the use of this technology over the following 12 years increasing from 375 patients in 2013 to 2,389 in 2020. Now patients with multiple tumour types benefit from this therapy. **\[S3\]** 

 Skills gained in delivery of clinical trials have **built capacity of local healthcare staff** and encouraged the adoption of the cutting\-edge techniques into routine practice. For example, Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy \(SABR\), an external beam radiotherapy which provides better tumour targeting, was introduced through the SPORT Trial as the **first if its kind in the UK** and led to **14 therapeutic radiographers** being trained in the technique **\[S4\].** 

 A patient involved in the SABR trial talks about how his life has improved **\[S5\]** 

 He said: *“If it wasn’t for this research, I simply would not be here.  My family and I are so thankful to the doctors who have helped us.  This treatment has allowed me to live my life again.""* 

 *“I knew about the side effects of treatment, and they really frightened me, but this trial meant I had very little discomfort or complications and can return to normal life, for that I am very grateful*.” 

 Overall, 605 men have participated in prostate cancer clinical trials in NI since 1 August 2013 allowing access to novel treatments and improving their quality of life. **\[S4\]** 

 Metastatic prostate cancer moves to the bones in most patients and so the development of Ra\-223, which specifically **targets the bone,** is a **breakthrough treatment**. The ALSYMPCA phase 3 trial, in which O’Sullivan was Northern Ireland lead, showed that patients treated with Ra\-223 had a **median survival of 3.6 months** more than men treated with placebo **\[S6\]** with **an excellent safety profile** and a **6\-month delay in skeletal events** \(fractures or spinal compression\) commonly associated with mCRPC **\[S6\].**  <ins>Belfast was the biggest recruitment centre</ins> for the trial with **44 patients** recruited directly by JOS and colleagues. The NICE Radium\-223 impact resource report 2016 estimated that around 360 people in England would receive Ra\-223 each year **\[S7\]**. 

 Patients have also benefitted from early access to advance radiotherapy treatments introduced as a result of trials. For example, as a result of the CHHiP trial which tested hypofractionated radiotherapy there are now new recommendations for a new standard of care for men with prostate cancer. **Men now receive fewer treatments with the same results, leading to less disruption to their lives, including a reduction in hospital visits, with an average saving of 17 visits per patient.** It is estimated that this will save the **NHS in England at least GBP8,000,000 per year** **\[S8\]**. The use of IMRT, IGRT, and hypofractionated radiotherapy are now included in NICE guidance **\[S9\]** 

 **Policy impact** 

 ARG research underpinned the guidance for Ra\-223 therapy at the national \(NICE guideline TA412\) **\[S2,S9\]** and international levels including the Irish Cancer Strategy, and guidance produced by the European Association of Urology and the European Society for Medical Oncology.  **\[S10\].** 

 **Commercial Impact** 

 Ra\-223 was co\-developed by Algeta ASA and Bayer Schering Pharma AG in a collaboration that started in 2009. The success of the ALSYMPCA phase 2 and phase 3 trials brought economic benefit to Algeta ASA with the positive trial results leading to **acquisition** of Algeta by Bayer for a sum of **USD2,900,000,000** in December 2013 with Bayer claiming it was one of its top 5 most important cancer drugs at the time. **\[S11\].** 

 Xofigo is approved for use in more than **50 countries**, including the U.S., the European Union, China and Japan **\[S12\].** Bayer recorded sales of Xofigo of EUR270,000,000 in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of 2018. **\[S13\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Kormos and her team’s research investigated how individuals with specific learning difficulties \(SpLDs\) develop their second language skills and what instructional methods are effective in helping them to acquire a second language. They developed evidence\-based language teacher education programmes from which over 60,000 teachers benefitted in terms of enhanced language teaching skills and knowledge and which has had an educational impact on approximately 500,000 language learners with SpLDs internationally. Based on the research, major international publishers of language teaching materials, global language testing organisations and teacher training institutions in Europe have introduced novel inclusive practices in language teaching and assessment of second language competence. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In many contexts, being able to communicate in an additional language is just as essential as literacy or numeracy skills. Prior to Kormos and her team’s work in this area, the language learning processes for students with additional needs had received limited attention. To ensure that learners with specific learning difficulties \(SpLDs\), who constitute approximately 10% of the student population, have access to education and the job market, and, in some cases, can perform regular daily activities, they need support in acquiring additional languages. The research programme investigated how students with SpLDs acquire additional languages and addresses this significant research gap and acute social and educational issue. Their work aims to develop effective institutional programmes, and has revealed how language learners with SpLDs acquire an additional language, what barriers the educational context presents to them and how these can be overcome. Their work primarily focussed on younger language learners \(aged between 10 and 16 years\) learning English as a foreign/second language in instructed classroom contexts, as they constitute the largest population of language learners today. 

 The team’s research was the first large\-scale of its kind internationally and had the explicit aim of enhancing the inclusion of students with SpLDs in foreign language education \[R1\-R3\]. The initial research was conducted between 2008 and 2010 in Hungary but has since been extended to other European contexts and has become international and cross\-institutional. The research revealed the following insights: 

 1. Students with SpLDs face disproportionate difficulties when learning a second language \[R2, R3\]. In a ground\-breaking study, Kormos, Sarkadi and Csizér \(Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary\) used a large\-scale questionnaire to survey 1,182 school children aged between 13 and14 with and without SpLDs. This was complemented with in\-depth qualitative interviews of 20 language learners with SpLDs. They also investigated how teachers perceive the language learning challenges of students with SpLDs. The results highlighted that students with SpLDs face problems in developing accurate and fluent second language reading skills, and in expanding their vocabulary and grammatical knowledge. The project also concluded that learners with SpLDs often lose their motivation because of non\-inclusive language teaching environments that do not take their specific needs into account \[R1, R2\]. 

 2. Kormos, Csizér and Sarkadi conducted a multiple\-site case study of 3 successful language teaching programmes for students with SpLDs in Hungary that provided evidence of the benefits of carefully structured language instruction that involves multiple sensory channels \[R3\]. 

 3. As part of the project, the team also examined the access arrangements of international language testing organisations and interviewed 15 test\-takers with SpLDs about their experiences during language exams. The study revealed inconsistencies in the way students with SpLDs are accommodated in language testing and highlighted candidates’ challenges in accessing special exam arrangements offered by national and international language testing organisations. 

 4. In a series of studies Indrarathne and Kormos examined how lower working memory capacity and attention regulation abilities, both of which are characteristic of individuals with SpLDs affect learning of novel grammatical constructions in another language \[R4, G1\]. Using state of the art eye\-tracking technology, they found that learners with less efficient cognitive processing skills benefit more from explicit teaching and need more practical opportunities to become successful language learners than those with higher levels of cognitive abilities. 

 5. Within the first phase of the *Dyslexia for Teachers of English as a Foreign Language* project between 2011 and 2013 \[G2\], Kormos and Nijakowska \(University of Lodz, University of Warsaw\) administered a large\-scale survey to 500 language teachers in 15 European countries and established that approximately 80% of language teachers in Europe lacked appropriate knowledge about the nature of SpLDs \(including dyslexia\) and expertise in creating an inclusive language teaching environment. 

 6. In a series of projects in Slovenia and Hungary between \(2017 and2019\),  Kormos with Košak\-Babuder, Ratajczak and Pižorn investigated the benefits of exam access arrangements, such as offering students with SpLDs the opportunity to listen to a text while reading \[R5\] and more recently the role of extended reading assessment time, in collaboration with the British Council \[G3\]. The results of their studies highlight the importance of accessible test design in ensuring that test\-takers with SpLDs are not unfairly disadvantaged in second language assessment.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Enhancing teachers’ inclusive language teaching practices in Europe through the DysTEFL and ENGaGe projects** 

 Based on investigations into the nature of language learning difficulties in students with SpLDs, and the effectiveness of structured multi\-sensory programs \[R1\-R3\], Kormos continued to develop an innovative and evidence\-based teacher\-training course after she started employment with Lancaster University in 2008. This was done through collaboratiions with a team of Polish, Czech and Hungarian researchers and teacher educators in the European Commission\-funded project Dyslexia for Teachers of English as a Foreign Language project \(DysTEFL, between 2011 and 2016\). The DysTEFL project achieved major impact in raising language teachers’ awareness of inclusion and in equipping them with effective and up\-to\-date pedagogical tools to make language learning more accessible for students with SpLDs. Since the release of the DysTEFL project toolkits in 2013, approximately 200 language teachers from Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Greece and the UK have been trained face to face. 3,500 participants have undertaken the online self\-study course, 20,000 people have downloaded the DysTEFL training booklets, and nearly 40,000 users have interacted with the self\-study course materials. In feedback from post\-course questionnaires all participating teachers reported that their confidence in applying inclusive language teaching practices had increased, and their pedagogical toolkits for working with language learners with SpLDs had been enriched \[S1a\]. In her post\-course written feedback, one of the teachers said, *“It was an amazing and very insightful course; I have learnt a lot of useful things that I can use to my dyslexic pupils’ advantage.”* The project received a ‘Success Story’ award from the Directorate\-General for Education and Culture of the European Commission, who acknowledged the impact and contribution of the project to policy\-making in a number of European countries. The materials won the British Council’s ELTon award in the ‘Innovative Teacher Resources’ category in 2015 \[S1b\]. The judges described the project as *“a much\-needed course for teachers and one that addresses a gap in the market.”* 

 The research insights describing specific characteristics of learners with SpLDs and the benefits of carefully structured multi\-sensory teaching approaches \[R1\-R3, R5, R6\] were also incorporated into an online teacher training module accompanying the digital English and German task bank during the ENGaGe project, and which targets young dyslexic language learners aged between 10 and 14 years. ENGaGe ran between 2017 and 2020 and was funded by the European Commission. The task bank includes a variety of innovative online tasks that provide a multi\-sensory approach for language learners with SpLDs. The task bank and accompanying research\-based teacher training module were developed in collaboration with teacher educators and software designers \(Universities of Miskolc and Szeged and Navigate in Hungary, University of Warsaw, Poland, Masaryk University, Czech Republic\). In 2019, 67 English\- and German\-language teachers from central Europe were trained in using this methodological toolkit. Since then, a further 500 users have accessed and completed tasks in this innovative online teacher education module. In the programme’s follow\-up survey, 86% of the teachers stated that they would apply the approaches introduced in the teacher training module in their teaching practices and 75% of the 67 teachers who tried out the task bank reported that it was useful in achieving their teaching aim and was engaging for learners with SpLDs. In their post\-course evaluative survey, 80% of the 253 students described the task bank as motivating and useful \[S2\]. 

 **Enabling teachers around the globe** 

 In 2015, Kormos developed the Dyslexia and Foreign Language Learning MOOC \(via FutureLearn\) *,* which continues to attract large numbers of English and additional language teachers each year, dyslexic language learners and parents of children with SpLDs. Drawing on the team’s research \[R1,R3,R5,R6\], the MOOC has communicated latest insights into the impact of SpLDs on language learning and effective teaching methods to 50,000 participants from over 100 countries \(including India, Brazil, Uganda and Argentina\). The course is now fully accredited in the UK and provides formal CPD for teachers \(approximately 500 teachers annually in the UK\). The MOOC has been incorporated as a core component of language teacher education programmes in Israel \(Oranim College, 200 future teachers graduating each year\) and Italy \(University of Udine, 100 teachers each year\) \[S3\]. A survey of MOOC participants conducted in 2017 by Kormos and Nijakowska \[S4a\] demonstrated that engagement with the research through the MOOC significantly and successfully increased language teachers’ self\-confidence in implementing inclusive language teaching practices and that teachers’ attitudes to inclusion became significantly more positive. Feedback also demonstrated how uptake of the research has enhanced the language learning experiences and proficiency of students with SpLDs \[S4b\]. One of the 2018 MOOC participants stated *“the knowledge I have gained here has influenced me so deeply, that I already seem to subconsciously apply certain strategies to my teaching. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to take my teaching a step further and give students with SpLDs more opportunities to develop their skills and enjoy learning.”* 

 **Introducing inclusive language teaching practices in Sri Lanka** 

 Based on the research into the benefits of explicit language teaching and the importance of additional practice opportunities, Indrarathne disseminated research findings \[R4\] through a series of highly successful teacher training events across Sri Lanka in 2017 on behalf of the team. The teacher training materials were adapted from those of the DysTEFL project to meet the specific contextual needs in Sri Lanka. Indrarathne worked with 100 teacher educators and 192 language teachers to disseminate knowledge of the effects of SpLDs on second language learning and to help participants implement inclusive language teaching practices. In 2017, Kormos also delivered a workshop to 20 key teacher trainers, national exam developers, and members of the National Institute of Education on potential educational changes intended to foster inclusion in language teaching. A questionnaire and interview analysis showed that the teacher training programme increased teachers’ knowledge of, and developed positive attitudes towards, SpLDs and verified their readiness to implement inclusive practices \[S5a\]. These events have highlighted the need for the implementation of inclusive language teaching practices at ministerial level, and subsequent government\-level policy initiatives to acknowledge the needs of learners with disabilities in national exams and the design of language teaching materials in Sri Lanka. Alongside confirming these changes, the Assistant Commissioner of Examinations also reported that “ *after the training, I used the assessment techniques discussed in the workshop in designing language tests which are used at national level in the country*”, with the potential to reach 200,000 of language students each year \[S5b\]. 

 **Raising awareness among educational influencers** 

 Drawing on her research into the effects of SpLDs on learning additional languages \[R1\-R3, R5, R6\] Kormos has delivered teacher training workshops on teaching English to students with dyslexia between 2014 and 2019. In total, she has reached approximately 1,000 teachers and teacher trainers across Slovenia, Poland, Malta, Hungary, Italy, France, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan. These workshops and presentations served as a means of engagement to build connections between the research on language learners with SpLDs and primary\- and secondary\-school language teachers and in\- and pre\-service teacher educators at teacher training colleges and universities. The workshops and presentations provided access to expertise in inclusive teaching methods across a variety of contexts, thereby contributing to an expected improvement in language learning experiences and proficiency of students with SpLDs at the primary, secondary and tertiary education levels. The Associate Dean for Teacher Education at the University of Ljubljana stated that *“a close collaboration with Prof. Kormos has resulted in an increased awareness and enhanced knowledge of the needs of children with dyslexia in language learning among trainee teachers.  A new generation of primary school language learners has already benefited and will continue to benefit from this enhanced awareness of inclusion”* \[S6\]. Kormos also worked with 30 teachers and 50 learners of various foreign languages in the Diplomatic Academy of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office UK, whose head language teacher reported, *“The talk for staff and the workshop for teachers are important first step in helping us to factor in learning difficulties to our language training to ensure we are giving students the support they need to fulfil their potential”* \[S7\] *.* 

 **Enabling inclusive assessment practices** 

 The impact of our research on the beneficial role of special arrangements for students with SpLDs \[R3, R6\] also extends to the assessment of second language competence. This work has raised awareness of the need to create more inclusive language tests amongst major international language testing organisations. Kormos was invited to become expert consultant for Cambridge Assessment in 2018 \(whose language tests cover approximately 30% of the market for language proficiency tests and are taken by 6million students worldwide\). She was also invited to become an expert reviewer for Trinity College London in 2017 and Oxford University Press in 2016, on special arrangements for students with disabilities undertaking language proficiency tests. She developed a webinar for Cambridge Assessment on testing students with dyslexia in 2019, and the senior research and inclusion team had commenced  integrating the research findings into their examination policies to ensure fair assessment opportunities and appropriate access arrangements for candidates with disabilities. However, plans were disrupted due to Covid\-19, but are expected to start again in summer 2021. 

 **Promoting inclusion in educational publishing; developing language teaching materials** 

 In 2018, a position paper and guidance based on the research was developed by Oxford University Press \(OUP\) and Cambridge University Press \(CUP\) for decision\-makers in English language teaching \[R1\-3, R5, R6\]. OUP said: “ *Since its launch, the paper has been downloaded over 9,000 times by teachers, school managers, policy makers and ministries of education. Its recommendations have and continue to inform discussions with decision makers and curricula developers in various parts of the* world” \[S8\]. Both OUP and CUP, which are amongst the largest English language teaching publishing houses in the world, applied the evidence\-informed recommendations to make language teaching coursebooks more inclusive, and to better meet the needs of language learners with SpLDs. In 2020, Kormos delivered 2 workshops for CUP’s course development team. “ *The workshops gave us hands\-on advice on how we can design and develop our language teaching coursebooks so that they become more accessible for students with a variety of needs. The coursebooks to which we will apply these principles and modifications are/will be used by millions of learners around the globe, including our key markets of Spain, Italy, Turkey, China, Mexico and Brazil”* \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Stockwell’s method of developing and enacting inclusionary projects serves the dual purpose of engaging and empowering vulnerable groups in traditional museum spaces while serving to extend the reach of the institutions and assisting them as they integrate marginalised narratives. Through her projects, Stockwell and the co\-creators confront ideas of cultural institutions’ hegemony in the socio\-cultural narrative to provide novel and diverse perspectives. Stockwell developed artistic expression for individuals, diversity in museum collections and international dialogue about the themes in her projects. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Stockwell’s methodology aims to recontextualise inanimate objects, intending to connect her artistic co\-creations to modern people and problems. Textiles feature throughout her work, often paired with thematic representation of femininity such as in her *Territory Dress,* or consumerism in works like *Rumpelstiltskin* **\(R1\)**. Stockwell deals with colonial heritages and its implications, subverting its imagery and iconography to do so using the skills and hands of those affected to undermine its hegemony. There are three major research areas to her work: 

 **1\) Trade, human migration and currency boats** 

 The recurring motif of boats are recontextualised to confront aspects of trade and human migration. A prominent example of her boats is the installation contributed to **Boîte\-en\-Valise: Generator \(R2\)**. Six artists were commissioned to create their transportable work with supplies they could bring in a suitcase to the Venice Biennale, Italy, and reinstalled in Syracuse, New York, USA. The iterations of her installation responded to and dialogued with the Cuban Artist, Abisay Puente, to address the themes of transiency and migrancy, challenging her audiences with the nature of borders, boundaries and injustice. 

 Likewise, her 2016 exhibition **SEA\-MARKINGS**, at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford\-upon\-Avon, questioned the modern understanding of plays such as Othello, demonstrating the relationship between contemporary views on sea\-faring and trade in the wider context of historical colonialism **\(R3\)**. In 2019, she revisited the currency boats in *Trade Winds*, St Peter’s Church, Cambridge as part of **Migrant Knowledge: Early Modern and Beyond**, a study on human migration with the University of Cambridge. In this instance, Stockwell examined personal relationships with money, as a freeing or restrictive mechanism. 

 **2\) Joining pieces together** 

 **Peace Makers \(R4\)** was the final commissioned work \( *Piece\-makers* **\)** following a 2\-year project with the National Army Museum. It addresses the issues facing soldiers returning from conflict through a patchwork quilt inspired by the museum’s collection and the soldiers’ experiences, pieced together from decommissioned army blankets. The additional embroidery invokes the veterans’ understanding of, and challenges around, duty, solidarity, joy, loss and pride. 

 As Artist\-in\-Residence at the City law firm Pinsent Masons, Stockwell embarked on a project with staff to co\-create a quilt **\(R5\)**. Originally intended as a response to impending Brexit concerns and the need to re\-establish community bonds between staff of many nationalities, Covid\-19 shifted the focus of the work to remote co\-creation as a meditative unifying process. Stockwell continued to explore unity in the Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Bartha Contemporary, London, where she participated in a group exhibition called **Should I Stay or Should I Go?** **\(R6\),** exploring Brexit through emotions, rather than politics. 

 **3\) Change, mass production and consumerism** 

 *Rumpelstiltskin* **\(R1\)** depicts transformative greed by using blue fabric fed through sewing machines, alluding to the textile industry and its impact on the modern market and environment. For the duration of the installation, Stockwell used co\-production events to juxtapose the consumerism of her piece with remedial work in the community \(2017\-2019\). During her time in Portsmouth, Stockwell expanded, developed and adapted her collaborative methodology to engage with different groups such as homeless people, families, visually impaired people, drug addicts and the general public.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1\) Fostering understanding and learning through participatory projects** 

 **1.1 Enhancing cultural experience and public understanding** 

 
The broad appeal of Stockwell’s highly\-political work facilitates international touring and exhibition, where the local context is emphasised, for example, the relevance of her work *Territory Dress* to Dutch audiences when it was exhibited at the Tropen Museum, Amsterdam **\(S1\)**. 

 *Figure 1. Tropen Museum Website Homepage* 

Through **Boîte\-en\-Valise: Generator**, Stockwell and her co\-artists were able to bring emotional comprehension to topics such as political and artistic refugees. 

 *“Art galleries in Cuba closed their doors to me and here I am now, writing on the wall of this gallery, fragments of my story, freely” – Abisay Puente, artist* **\(R4\)** 

 
These issues are pertinent as many countries, including the UK and USA, erect barriers by enacting policies restricting travel and immigration. By supporting her co\-artists, Stockwell and her work helped to empower people disenfranchised by their governments, so raising awareness of this issue in a compassionate and contemplative manner. 

 *Figure 2. Feature in The Guardian* 



Stockwell was commissioned to create *Jerusalem\-By\-Exit* for the exhibition, **Should I Stay or Should I Go?** which generated national interest and media discussion **\(S2\),** challenging visitors to weigh the psychological consequences of Brexit. Stockwell uses the relationship between the private self and wider society as a tool to promote social awareness, such as with her mediations on currency in **Trade Winds** or the modern relationship with historical colonialism in **SEA\-MARKINGS**. 

 
**1.2 Decolonising textiles, museum spaces and collections.** Stockwell’s choice of subject matter and material questions colonialization, globalization, trade and migration. Her work has been internationally recognised as part of an important shift in the curation of museum spaces to decolonise their collection **\(S3\)**. 

 *Figure 3. National Army Museum website* 

**1.3 The Commemoration of Rehabilitation, Reconciliation and Peace.** Stockwell’s extensive **Peace Maker** project, commissioned by the National Army Museum, has toured six regimental museums showcasing the struggles and rehabilitation of the participating soldiers. Throughout the project, Stockwell worked with soldiers to lead them through an exploratory, creative process which helped them build self\-confidence, artistic development and personal understanding of their experiences. By focusing on rehabilitation and reconciliation, Stockwell expressed an aspect of the soldiers’ lives which is often not commemorated in artistic works but remains crucial to soldiers living today **\(S4\)**. 

 **1.4 Incorporating methodology into corporate spaces.** Stockwell’s durational project at Pinsent Masons has enabled the company to address a pressing need for closeness and therapeutic outlets in trying times for the 500 staff in their London office. During the pandemic, Stockwell develops methods to continue co\-creating, safely and inclusively, providing an important outlet for positive mental health behaviours for staff. The project, which will be displayed in the office when completed, fosters a continued engagement with art and promotes the sustainability of mental wellness and social equity in the workplace. 

 *“Susan brings exciting new perspective to the residency in her approach to sustainability and collaboration” – David Isaac, Chair of Pinsent Mason Art Committee* **\(R2\)**. 

 **2\) Nurturing creative culture for a more inclusive society** 

 *Figure 4. Crossan with **Brothers in Arms** 



**2.1 Sustained participation and cultural engagement with marginalised groups.** With her extensive outreach programmes, Stockwell has empowered many marginalised groups by guiding the artistic progression of the participants, especially those under\-represented in artistic spaces **.** Projects of such extended duration, such as the workshops in Portsmouth, provide life\-long skills of making and mending which benefit participants long after completion. Stockwell has influenced participant’s methodology including understanding the importance of collaborative working practice. 



 *“There was a sense of inclusiveness to our sessions despite our wide range of levels and experience” – Michael Crossan, former soldier and artist* **\(S5\).** 

 *Figure 5. Tweet about Stockwell’s workshops* 

Crossan is exemplary of the lasting impact of Stockwell’s methodology. Following the **Peace Maker** project, he has progressed onto leading projects of his own with the homeless and other vulnerable people, using similar practices to Stockwell and encouraging co\-creation in art **\(S6\)**. 

 **2.2 Pushing boundaries and carving spaces for women** Her continuing work as a women sculptor who specialises in traditionally feminine mediums such as textiles has earned Stockwell recognition alongside Rachel Whiteread, Maggi Hambling and Louise Bourgeois in the history of women and sculpting in the 2020 book, *50 Women Sculptors* **\(S7a\-b\).** The medium of Stockwell’s sculptures and the subject matter in works like *Territory Dress* specifically target both the spaces women inhabit and are absent from.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Fit\-for\-purpose education of athletes is a necessary component of anti\-doping programmes that adequately promotes clean sport behaviour. Working with the World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\), Petróczi’s research on doping and clean sport behaviour, development of new measures and novel methodologies, and contributions to evaluations and capacity building, has resulted in overlapping impacts in the education of athletes, including: 

-  Supporting anti\-doping education to over 62,000 athletes in 230 countries, through online educational resources 

-  Increasing athlete partnership and stakeholders’ participation in anti\-doping research and programmes 

-  Implementing an athlete\-centred approach in WADA’s and other organisations’ anti\-doping education 

-  New capacity for WADA, sport federations, event organisers and anti\-doping organisations with standardised evaluation of anti\-doping outreach activities 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\) is an independent international agency with a mission to ensure that athletes from around world can compete in a doping\-free environment. Specific to its education provision, WADA promotes a social awareness campaign for familiarising athletes and their entourage with ‘clean sport’ messages, providing tools to assist with its education programmes. 

 Since 1999, and coinciding with the creation of WADA, Petróczi has been a forerunner in doping behaviour research **.** Her research concerns conceptualising doping behaviour into empirically testable models along with developing psychometric measures and novel methodologies. In particular, her research focuses on the behavioural aspects of doping and abstinence **\[R1, R2\]**, along with developing ways to accurately assess suspected cognitive antecedents of doping **\[R3, R4\]**. Highlighting that the constant need for performance\-enhancement, the typical pressure points and vulnerability factors for doping are normal elements in a competitive elite athlete’s life, Petróczi surmised that anti\-doping education must acknowledge and address these issues in a positive and pragmatic way; rather than making athletes feel guilty for experiencing situations where doping is a viable but undesirable option **\[R5\]**. The key transformative element of Petróczi’s research placed ‘doping’ in the broader context of mental representations of performance\-enhancement activities in sport **\[R2, R5, R6\]**. This has provided a theoretical base to underpin a holistic educational approach that connects all levels of the athlete development pathways, form amateur to international elite through the ‘Doping Awareness Literacy’ concept \(SAFE YOU and SAFE YOU\+ grants\). It moved the discourse on doping away from a purely moralistic view \(which is only relevant to competitive elite level\), paving the way for the development of an educational framework built on skills and competencies \(‘literacy’\), enabling athletes at all levels to make responsible and informed decisions for themselves. 

 Petróczi also advocated that anti\-doping education must move to a more athlete\-centred approach, and values\-based education must move away from a substance\-based approach and address doping as a sport integrity issue. Anti\-doping education needs to focus on helping and supporting athletes to ‘stay clean’ as opposed to ‘stopping’ doping. Petróczi also called for the development of a sufficient level of literacy for navigating the complex landscape of elite sport. Gradually, and because of her on\-going collaboration with WADA on anti\-doping education, Petróczi’s research has deepened understanding of motives for clean sport behaviour, and shaped anti\-doping education. Consequently, this work attracted the interest and further funding from WADA, as well as from the International Olympic Committee and the European Union. The research focussed on the meaning of clean sport, the clean athlete identity, values and value systems underpinning doping and abstinence **\[R6\]**; and anti\-doping legitimacy **\[R7\]** to inform ecologically valid preventive measures and anti\-doping education that fits better to contemporary society and elite sport **\[R5\]**. 

 In combination with a better conceptual clarity around legitimacy perception **\[R7\]**, Petróczi’s research into doping **\[R1\-R5\]** and clean sport behaviour **\[R6\]** was also instrumental for devising evaluative measures for assessing the effect of anti\-doping outreach and education.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Petróczi's research has redefined doping, as well as clean sport behaviour, as a reasoned choice by individuals, shifting WADA’s focus of anti\-doping from ‘preventing doping’ to ‘protecting clean sport’ and thus led to improvements in WADA’s anti\-doping education, leading to new education materials, the implementation of an athlete\-centred approach, improved education capacity, and enhanced harm\-protection for athletes. 

 <ins>New Education Materials</ins> 

 In 2013, Petróczi was invited by WADA to review its new online anti\-doping e\-learning course \- called the ‘Athlete Learning Program about Health and Anti\-Doping’ \(ALPHA\). Her review identified that athletes were considered targets rather than partners in keeping sport clean. To address these issues, Petróczi was commissioned to develop two new modules \(modules 7 & 8\) and to write a book chapter for WADA’s handbook that would provide guidance for the anti\-doping community on how to make anti\-doping education fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century **\[R5\]**. 

 These two new modules demonstrated the change of WADA’s traditional normative approach to building positive partnership with athletes for clean sport and to support athletes in this process. The revised ALPHA was launched to the global sport community in March 2014, and ‘approaches doping issues from a positive mindset’ and ‘provides athletes with solutions’ **\[S1\]**. It was decommissioned in 2020 to make way for new technology and a new course. It was available in 18 languages, in 230 countries, and represented 195 sports. The course was completed by 62,859 athletes, and other stakeholders, in whom that anti\-doping education lives on **\[S2\]**. 

 Petróczi constructed tailored evaluations \(such as the ‘attitudes survey’\) to assess the impact of ALPHA on athletes, including measures identified by her research on doping antecedents. One key component of this set was Petróczi’s Performance\-Enhancement Attitude Scale **\[R3\]**, which to date is the only validated doping attitude scale. Since its inception in 2000, the scale has been translated into at least 14 languages and used in over 80 studies and five WADA research grants **\[R3\]**. In 2019, Petróczi updated the set of evaluative measures with more recent findings, with the WADA Senior Education Manager stating that her work ‘ *contributed immensely in terms of giving us insight to measures and metrics.*’ **\[S2\]** 

 <ins>Implementation of an athlete\-centred approach</ins> 

 WADA’s Senior Education Manager also described how Petróczi is ‘ *heading up the work package around athlete engagement*’. The RESPECT project modelled and increased athlete involvement in WADA’s research approach as well as directing future strategic priorities for WADA’s social science research. Inspired by athletes such as Jade Johnson from the IOC’s LEGIT project \(a cross\-national study regarding anti\-doping policy legitimacy and support among clean athletes\), Petróczi brought athletes, stakeholders, national anti\-doping organisations and academics together to study and discuss the meaning of ‘clean’. Provided with this template, WADA now starts research ‘ *with athletes placed at its center*’ **\[S3\]** \- by considering athletes and influences upon athletes’ environments. With ‘Be Athlete\-Centered’ as one of six strategic priorities in the WADA 2020\-24 strategic plan **\[S4\]**, WADA is already investing in a project into athlete vulnerability and doping pressure points, based on Petróczi’s research **\[R5\]**.  Furthermore, in their 2021 Grant Program Guidance **\[S3\]**, WADA explain how their research priorities going forward were ‘ *informed by a comprehensive Delphi study … initiated as part of an Erasmus\+ collaborative Partnerships funded research project \(RESPECT\-Clean Sport Alliance\)*’. These conclusions were emphasised in WADA’s November 2020 webinar **\[S6\]**, with the sharing of key principles such as ‘engaging athletes in the research process’, which arose from ALPHA **\[R5\]** and the RESPECT project **\[R6\]**. 

 The athlete\-centred approach drawn from Petróczi’s research has cascaded from WADA to inform the agendas of other organisations. The Anti\-Doping Division German Sport Institute shaped their funding agendas towards exploring and relating to the athlete’s perspective. The Director of the Argentina NADO explained how the ‘ *research has rethought anti\-doping education to centre upon athletes*’ and that ‘ *this has allowed us to enrich the education programmes backed by scientific evidence*’. Additionally, they have committed athletes to participate in focus groups and plan to copy the focus group model in Argentina **\[S5\]**. 

 <ins>Improved Evaluation Capacity</ins> 

 WADA invited Petróczi to collaborate in developing, compiling, and analysing evaluations of WADA’s worldwide outreach activities for raising awareness of anti\-doping. It was first used at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and most recently at the Lausanne Youth Winter Olympics in 2020. WADA found it gave them a ‘ *more nuanced insight into athletes’ thinking about doping. This informed advice and support provided to stakeholders to start doing this type of evaluation themselves.*’ **\[S2\]** These activities met and developed WADA’s social science strategic priorities, as detailed in the WADA November 2020 webinar **\[S6\]**, of ‘sharing what we know’, ‘developing research capability’, and ‘empowering ADOs in research’. 

 Another example of increasing programme capacity took place with the Oceania Regional Anti\-Doping Organisation \(ORADO\). The Director of the ORADO explained that Petróczi ‘ *led an orientation and equipped us \(with questionnaires and focus groups\) so that we could progress, and also made our team feel confident and empowered. We were able to actually see whether our current anti\-doping education programmes are making a difference, as we covered the sixteen member countries at the 2019 Pacific Games. We are now able to back up why we have different actions in education and how we approach different target groups because we can quantify the reality, mindset or attitude of our target group. The research, in line with WADA’s new strategic priorities, has shown us the importance of knowing our athletes and the influences on them*.’ This revealed ‘ *the need to revamp and refocus …training*’ for educators; with a third draft of the new curriculum already complete. Better educators ‘ *will deliver more meaningful and relevant anti\-doping messages to athletes and their support personnel*’ **\[S7\]**. 

 Partly as a rapid response to Covid\-19\-related challenges, and to address the need for at\-distance implementation, in 2020 a dedicated online platform was developed which allows organisations to collect prevalence data without the need for personal contact or a sporting event. The WADA Senior Education Manager explained how ‘ *Petróczi has been innovative in developing online tools and a tablet\-based survey for outreach events. It has been an interesting insight into the viability of doing this type of research online in the future.*’ **\[S2\]** 

 <ins>Harm\-prevention in young athletes and exercisers</ins> 

 Through the SAFE YOU Education Programme, under the leadership of Petróczi and others, an anti\-doping educational framework and resources were developed with young people aged 14\-25 years. Selected as a Success Story by the European Commission Directorate\-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture, it has increased international awareness and been adopted by at least three anti\-doping agencies. Since 2015, the SAFE YOU YouTube Channel has had over 8300 views, with individual videos each watched hundreds of times. The videos, in English but with German, Greek, and Italian subtitles promote informed responsible decision\-making by individuals **\[S8\]**. 

 The SAFE YOU educational programme and its materials were adopted by the German Anti\-Doping Agency to tackle doping at the sub\-elite and amateur level. The agency adapted its strategy and expanded its education programmes ‘ *by partnering with gyms and with two very big fitness companies*’ through ‘ *developing materials, hosting workshops and implementing strategies*’. This has resulted in increased awareness of the issue at a higher political level.  The then\-Director of Education and Prevention admired how they ‘ *were able to transfer Petróczi’s research into the practical world of the German NADO and then directly into the practical world of gyms. We established a number of feedback and learning loops between different organisations, including the Safe You team*’ **\[S9\]**. 

 A selection of the Safe You materials \(thematic education videos\) have been used by the British Association of Sport & Exercise Medicine as CPD materials, for teaching by the ORADO **\[S7\]** and in Aruba. The Argentina NADO are ‘ *currently analyzing the Safe You videos*’ **\[S5\]** to inform their national strategy. The then\-Executive Director of the Aruban Olympic Committee, and now Chairman of the Caribbean RADO, has written that ‘ *These materials \[the Safe You\+ videos\] filled a content gap in our anti\-doping education plan*’. Using the Safe You\+ video series with 13\-18 year olds athletes, followed by discussions, they found that the videos were ‘ *more attractive to young people than our previously\-used, dry presentation*’ and that ‘ *they encouraged more active learning and engagement*’. He concluded by noting that ‘ *most of the athletes will remember the message and the Aruban Anti\-Doping Commission will continue to use the materials*’ **\[S10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Müller's research focuses on the fate of children under Nazi rule and their testimonies. This work has had significant impacts on charities, schools, as well as organisations and authorities, in both the North\-East of England and South Africa, shaping the education of multiple publics about youth in the Third Reich. Müller's travelling exhibition on children's lives under Nazi rule and associated learning resources have expanded and deepened existing educational provision through their new focus on depicting war children's voices from all walks of life. These interventions have been particularly effective for educating young learners. The resultant changes in educational practices and resources have enriched the awareness of schoolchildren, vulnerable youths, as well as adult exhibition audiences about the dangers of racism. Müller's research has also shaped Holocaust Memorial Day \(HMD\) commemorations and related creative arts performances in the North\-East. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Whilst there is no shortage of scholarship on World War II and the Holocaust, the 'children’s turn' in that area is a recent phenomenon, as is the scholarly reorientation to incorporate analysis of the early post\-war period. Müller's research focuses on neglected sources about the experiences, voices, and representations of children under the Nazis in early post\-war archival collections, especially ego\-documents from the young \(such as testimonies and school essays\). These sources yield new insights into children's lives and their wartime memories, which – as Müller's research shows – are used for overcoming trauma and carving out new identities after geopolitical rupture. Müller's work enriches existing Holocaust education by shifting attention away from adults, focusing instead on learning about children other than Anne Frank. Her work offers: 

-  analyses of primary material that is not widely known and which has been carefully sourced from a range of different archives in Israel, Germany, the US, and the UK \(PUB1\-6\); 

-  new insights into the social, political, historical, and epistemological background that was driving testimony and school essay collections in the 1940s and 1950s, as well as a close reading and discourse analysis of this primary source material. These analyses result in a new cultural history of the figure and the voice of the war child in the post\-war imaginary \(PUB1\-6\); 

-  analyses of how young German war children affected by World War II processed their experiences in their testimonials, namely by using recollections of past events to create what Müller calls 'communities of responsibility', which in turn allows carving out new identities and intergenerational reconciliation based on moral evaluations and ideological re\-orientation \(PUB1&2\); 

-  the first English translation of hitherto unpublished Yiddish child Holocaust testimonies \(PUB3\). 

 By exploring under\-researched early post\-war primary archival material through critical discourse analysis, Müller’s work has made important interventions into Holocaust Studies, World War II Studies, and Childhood Studies; these achievements have been recognised by the award of internal and external funding, including fellowships from international funders and the Leverhulme Trust. What is unique to Müller's body of work is that her studies encompass primary, unpublished sources relating to Jewish child victims of the Holocaust as well as to German Gentile children who lived under the influence of the Nazis, which lays the ground for comparative work across the two constituencies. The focus on children’s voices establishes war children as witnesses and subjects, not just objects, of history. This approach fills a gap not only in research terms but also in existing educational provision and representational practices relating to the Third Reich and the Holocaust, which remain focused on adults' agency.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Types of impact**. The research has had an impact on understanding, learning, and awareness of both adolescent and adult publics. It has also impacted on teaching practices and resource provision, practitioners in schools and charities, creative arts, and on public services. 

 **Approaches to impact.** In order to help educate publics outside of academia about the consequences of war and racism as epitomised by the Holocaust, Müller developed multi\-pronged materials: 

 a\) a travelling exhibition on 'Children under the Nazis', curated by Müller in collaboration with the South African Holocaust and Genocide Foundation \(SAHGF\) in 2016/17; 

 b\) a portfolio of cognate interactive teaching and learning materials aimed primarily at secondary schools where the Holocaust is compulsory in the syllabus \(years 9 & 11 in South Africa and KS III in England\); 

 c\) a project website \(from November 2017; see  [http://teaching.ncl.ac.uk/childrenunderthenazis/](http://teaching.ncl.ac.uk/childrenunderthenazis/)\) which provides global, free access to the exhibition and the associated learning resources; 

 d\) a range of public talks about the research, for 'live' delivery to charities and local authorities, as well as for online repositories and thus global dissemination \(e.g. Johannesburg Holocaust Centre soundcloud \(May 2018\) or a commissioned talk for the German website of Yad Vashem, Israel's leading Holocaust research and memorial organisation \(January 2013\),  [<ins>https://tinyurl.com/u4v93q7</ins>](https://tinyurl.com/u4v93q7)\). 

 **Reach**. The most significant impact of Müller's research has been in South Africa and in the North\-East of England – locations chosen as foci of activities, because both have considerable problems with deprivation, discrimination, violence, and racism. Hence their adolescent learners and wider publics stand to benefit greatly from anti\-racist education as provided by Müller's research and resources. 

 The largest constituency of beneficiaries is made up of young learners from both countries. Müller's interactive workshops have directly benefited more than 1,000 secondary school students in Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg \(2017/18, IMP1, 3, 7, 8\). In North\-East England, approximately 2,300 users have had access to the exhibition used by teachers at their schools \(Boldon School, Newcastle College, and St Mary's Catholic School \(IMP2\); all 2019\); about 100 vulnerable adolescents have been reached through Müller's exhibition\-based workshops organised by local charities. Thus, Müller's programme has also been run with disadvantaged youths through working with relevant charities, e.g. in workshops with 68 adolescent members \(aged 13–17\) of the Cleveland Volunteer Police Cadets \(May 2018\), and with 4 different learner groups at Humankind \(formerly DISC\) in Newton Aycliffe \(County Durham\), during a one\-day anti\-racism event \(26 March 2018\) aimed mainly at post\-16 unemployed drop\-outs \(IMP1, pp. 2, 4\-5\). 

 In addition, approximately 50 professional Holocaust educators, history teachers, and social/charity workers have benefited from training received for using Müller's resources, which facilitated practice uptake by their organisations. 

 **Impact on understanding, learning, and awareness**. The exhibition educates learners about historical dangers of racism and social exclusion, and their relevance for today's world. In South Africa, the Holocaust is studied as a paradigm for racism, extremism, and genocide. Müller conducted extended trips to the country's three\-centred Holocaust and Genocide Foundation \(SAHGF; June 2017 and April/May 2018\), where she delivered interactive workshops to approx. 1,000 visiting schoolchildren and their teachers from 7 different schools in Cape Town, 3 in Durban, and 4 in Johannesburg. Feedback received stressed the value arising from the focus on children, the interactive nature of the peer\-guided learning process, and the deepened understanding of the impact of war. Learners praised the exhibition as an eye\-opener \(IMP1, p. 3, 5\) and said the focus on children's sufferings ""made the topic more relevant and showed how the Holocaust affected even the most innocent people"" \(IMP1, p. 13\). The exhibition's information on David Boder's oral history interviews illustrated for learners ""how important it is to hear experiences from the voices of survivors"" \(IMP1, p. 13\). One student commented: ""I learnt about the existence of voice recorded testimonies. I look forward to viewing them on the website"" \(IMP1, p.5\). Teachers were impressed, too; one regarded the exhibition\-cum\-workshop as ""the most educationally useful activity"" of the SAHGF's educational programme \(IMP1, p.15\). 

 In the North\-East of England, students from colleges and secondary schools have likewise benefited from working with the exhibition, e.g. Boldon School or OnCampus Sunderland, whose young international learners wrote they ""gained a deeper understanding"" of the Holocaust, and a teacher felt the programme was ""so worthwhile"" that it ""should be rolled out as widely as possible"" \(IMP1, p.14\). The students benefited from the focus on youth, as confirmed by the Head of History of St Mary's Catholic School : ""We believe the students gain a lot from the exhibition. In particular, the students engaged with the ‘in their own words’ panels as this gives students a real insight into individual accounts, which really brings the true story to life for the students. In addition, the students find it more engaging having accounts and information about children their own age and their experience, they found it more shocking hearing the impact on children living under Nazi rule as well as the impact on adults."" As a result, her school ""would love to have the panels every year"" \(IMP2\). 

 While in South Africa, Müller also gave two very well received public talks \(May 2018 in Johannesburg's Holocaust Centre, 50 attendees; June 2017 in Cape Town, approximately 60 participants\). The Director of the Cape Town Holocaust Centre wrote: ""Many attendees reflected that the talk and the exhibition presented new knowledge and made them thus engage in a fresh way with the topic of post war testimony, especially that of young people"" \(IMP3\). 

 In England, impact on public awareness and understanding has arisen from public engagement activities organised in liaison with local authorities, educational organisations, and charities. Here, Müller's work has reached a wide range of different beneficiaries. Thus, the exhibition was on public display in the City Library as part of Newcastle City Council's HMD programme for 2018 \(12 February 2018\-11 March 2018\); one visitor appreciated learning a ""new perspective on a well\-known topic"" \(IMP1, p. 6\), another ""enjoyed reading about contemporary testimonies and the range of primary sources"", and someone else wrote that the ""exhibition is very thought provoking and I am now very interested in more research of this subject"" \(IMP1, p.7\). Müller's project informed Newcastle's HMD 2019 and 2020 in two ways: \(a\) North Tyneside City Council showed the exhibition in The Quadrant in January, and the panels will now form a permanent fixture of this council's annual HMD programme; \(b\) a range of creative arts performances created by the Arts Council\-funded Skimstone Arts, performed repeatedly in the North\-East \(January, June, September 2019; January 2020\), drew on information supplied by Müller, as the Artistic Director confirmed: ""Dr Beate Muller's input was extremely beneficial as it signposted me to testimonies I would not otherwise have known about. These testimonies and her knowledge \[…\] gave me very rich material to read which \[was\] influencing some of the content for our public performances of Peace process\-ion2"" \[sic\] \(IMP4\). This ""powerful \[…\] collaboration"" with Müller, she added, influenced 'Peace Procession 3' and became a ""key inspiration"" for the HMD\-related radio broadcasts of 'Who Holds the Torch' \(IMP4\). In November 2020, North Tyneside Council's HMD Working Group asked Müller to record a video talk on children under the Nazis as part of their portfolio of activities for HMD2021; this 23 minutes long video has already been circulated to local schools by the Council's Schools Improvement Advisor, and a hard copy deposited with the Religious Resources Centre \(RRC\) in North Shields, where the exhibition was shown \(October 2018\), which, together with an associated public talk \(15 November 2018\), attracted approximately 150 visitors \(IMP5\). 

 **Impact on practice, practitioners, and public services.** Müller's research on authentic, early post\-war war children's voices and their pedagogical value for today's teachings has reached educators and practitioners, e.g. through her delivery of a teacher training session about survivor testimonies for a CPD course for the national Holocaust Education Trust \(Leicester, February 2017\). The RRC's Director wrote that ""the exhibition was an excellent asset in the continuing professional development of the Religious Resources Centre's staff team"" as ""the focus on young people was an area many of us had not considered before. It has enriched our ability to support our members"" \(IMP5\). Having worked closely with North Tyneside City Council in the context of their HMD programme, Müller was asked to join the council's HMD Working Group \(April 2020\), and so shall help shape future commemorative events \(IMP6\). 

 In South Africa, Müller trained 20 SAHGF educators and staff on how to use the exhibition with young learners. SAHGF ""educators in all three Holocaust Centres have been very excited to use the exhibition as a teaching tool"" and ""feel confident to run the programme using \[Müller's\] material"" \[IMP3\]. SAHGF staff adapted Müller’s educational programme by developing an alternative set of worksheets suitable for smaller learner groups and shorter time slots for off\-site usage, which they then ran with 102 students across 4 Cape Town schools in 2017. In 2018, SAHGF staff used Müller's materials with 238 learners from 5 local schools in Johannesburg \(IMP7\), and in spring 2019, Redhill School in Johannesburg borrowed the exhibition for 3 weeks, training some of their students as guides who then facilitated the learning of hundreds of their peers. There has therefore been practice uptake by the SAHGF. The three SAHGF directors praised the engaging nature of the programme, stressed the effectiveness of the focus on children for young learners \(""exhibition finds great interest in the 14 to 17 years old age group as it speaks about experiences of youth like them"", IMP7\), and expressed their gratitude for the ""enhancement of our teaching materials"" \(IMP8\) through the permanent deposition of two physical exhibition copies with the SAHGF. 

 **Significance.** Müller's research has changed public awareness about how children fared under the Nazis, it has deepened beneficiaries' historical knowledge about World War II, and has demonstrated the dangers of racism today especially to adolescent learners. Thus, young learners commented that ""This exhibition opened my eyes. \[…\] I’ve learnt the importance of not categorising others."" \(IMP1, p.3\). Another one wrote about the importance not to ""stereotype, be judgemental and be prejudiced because we are all equal"" \(IMP1, p.5\). In South Africa, students often made explicit links between racism during Nazi rule and under the Apartheid regime: ""The rules the Nazis used were similar to the ones used during apartheid"", wrote one learner \(IMP1, p.5\). The students understood the relevance of studying the Holocaust: ""The most important thing I learnt today"", one of them said, ""was why and how genocide develops, and why we learn about it today."" \(IMP1, p.11\). 

 Müller's activities have enriched educational and public engagement practices of charities, local authorities, and schools in South Africa and the North\-East of England.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Essex research on a key set of non\-cognitive and socio\-emotional skills in schoolchildren led to changes to school curricula and the introduction of new financial literacy programmes in Turkey. Alan’s research and rigorous evaluations of innovative educational programs implemented in under\-privileged schools in Turkey, led the Ministry of National Education to launch a similar nationwide curriculum in primary and post\-primary schools to improve non\-cognitive skills through the Design\-Skill Labs. Work with ING Bank Turkey led to the introduction of a financial literacy programme for schoolchildren while Alan’s research was drawn upon by the World Bank to cultivate socio\-emotional skills amongst students in North Macedonia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 There has been widespread concern over poor school outcomes and widening achievement gaps in most countries where educational policy actions tend to face challenges in engaging families of low socioeconomic strata. A growing body of research shows that certain attitudes and personality traits, also referred to as “non\-cognitive skills,” are strongly associated with achievement in various economic and social domains. 

 Since 2013, Alan’s research \[R1\-R6\] at Essex has evaluated channels through which economic outcomes of disadvantaged children \(with a particular focus on girls\) can be improved in the classroom environment. The aim of the research was to improve a key set of non\-cognitive skills in children of different age groups in a classroom environment by their own teachers. This research brings together academics, the public sector \(Turkish Ministry of National Education \[MoNE\]\), the private sector and NGOs involved in education and issues regarding achievement gaps across gender and socio\-economic strata. 

 An initial study, a randomized evaluation of a unique educational intervention involving 2500 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> grade elementary school students in Turkey, which was carried out in collaboration with ING Bank as part of a corporate social responsibility project, looked at patience in relation to student achievement outcomes \[R1\]. The intervention, designed by Alan, aimed to improve the ability to imagine future selves, and encourage forward\-looking behaviour using a structured curriculum delivered by the children’s own, trained teachers. It was shown that treated students become more patient in intertemporal decisions in incentivized experimental tasks and this effect persists for over a year after the initial intervention. This research also provides strong evidence that the specifically designed curriculum that aimed to foster forward\-looking behaviour in children improves behaviour in classroom as assessed by behavioural grade. 

 Further work carried out in collaboration with the Turkish Ministry of National Education evaluated another of Alan’s innovative educational interventions focused on “grit” \[R2\]. This research, involving over 3000 elementary school students, demonstrated that a program, which fosters grit and instils a growth mind\-set in children, significantly improves test scores, and that this improvement can persist for as long as 3 years after the implementation of the program. The method used to evaluate grit in this study, known as the “Alan\-Ertac Grit Measure” is now considered to be one of the most reliable inventories to elicit grit for a multitude of purposes and is used in several World Bank projects and by researchers in economics and psychology. 

 The research provides evidence that low\-cost educational interventions directed at elementary school students designed to improve non\-cognitive skills can have substantial impact on outcomes such as grades and behavioural conduct at school. Given the pivotal role of non\-cognitive skills for academic achievement and labour market success, this evidence has important implications for policy.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Professor Alan’s research and expertise led to her involvement as a key academic advisor on the importance of socio\-emotional skills and key non\-cognitive skills for institutions, banks and policy makers in Turkey and Macedonia. Collaborating with ING Bank, the Turkish Ministry of National Education and the World Bank, Professor Alan developed training materials, implemented and evaluated unique and innovative educational interventions to foster key non\-cognitive and socio\-emotional skills as an indispensable element of children’s academic success. 

 **Changes to the National Curriculum in Turkey** 

 Alan’s research on the role of non\-cognitive skills in success alongside the application of grit measurement methodology, the ‘Alan\-Ertac Grit measure’ \[R2\] led to the implementation of a new education policy to restructure primary and secondary education in Turkey to foster socio\-emotional and non\-cognitive skills such as patience and grit through a nationwide change to the curriculum. 

 The research, impact evaluations and RCTs, which involved designing and implementing unique curricula and teacher training practices to improve key socio\-emotional skills in socioeconomically disadvantaged elementary school children, shows that programmes which foster grit and instil a growth mind\-set in children, significantly improve student attainment and behaviour \[R2\] \[S1\]. The intervention was a low\-cost way of fostering non\-cognitive skills in the classroom and thus offers a solution for reducing achievement gaps where educational policy actions aiming to enhance family inputs face challenges in engaging families of low socioeconomic strata. This research directly influenced the design and subsequent delivery of a new element in the curricula for primary and secondary schools to teach non\-cognitive skills and prompted the Turkish Ministry of National Education to amend their overarching curriculum with the introduction of ‘Design\-Skill Labs’ \[S2\]. 

 The Turkish MoNE sets out in its 2023 vision that the curriculum is restructured as a series of flexible and modular structures, linked with skill sets, in an integrated manner across all levels. Based on Alan’s research and intervention \[R2\] a key part of this is the national rollout of the Design\-Skill Labs, which form part of the teaching in classrooms and affect the built environment with schoolyards re\-designed to transform them into spaces with real life experiences \[S3\]. The amendment to the curriculum is set to continue from primary into secondary education, Goal 2 of the 2023 Vision: Design\-Skill Workshops will be established at schools so that the knowledge gained can be translated into living skills \[S4\]. 

 Turkey's Education Vision 2023 published by the Ministry of National Education states: 

 *‘Design\-Skills Labs will be established at all schools for the development of the interests, talents, and character of our children. The curriculum will emphasize production, doing, interaction and deepening instead of revolving around testing and lecturing. Design\-Skill Labs will serve as the instrument of such a curriculum approach. The Design\-Skill Labs began as a pilot during 2019\-2020. They will help students experience a process of self\-revelation in which they can take time to think, design, and produce*.’ \[S4 p25\] 

 **Improved financial literacy through the ING Bank Orange Drops programme in Turkey** 

 Essex research on fostering key non\-cognitive skills such as patience and self\-control \[R3\] led to Professor Alan’s involvement with ING Bank’s Orange Drop financial literacy programme for children aged 8 and 9. Alan led the development and implementation of this financial literacy programme, which educates Turkish schoolchildren about the importance of saving and aims to make positive change in communities \[S5\]. 

 Alan’s research \[R5\] identified and developed a number of key skills around ‘patience’ and ‘grit’ and she led an interdisciplinary team of experts who focused on each of these skills in isolation to develop a novel curriculum for each. 

 Following the initial Orange Drop intervention led by Professor Alan a change in behaviour was reported. The ING Annual Report of 2017 states: 

-  Students became 21% more patient after the program. 

-  Students learned to be future\-oriented and to wait for bigger gains. 

-  While boys were less patient than girls at the beginning of the program, a stronger change in behaviour was observed in boys afterwards, and boys became 23% more patient. 

-  A positive relationship was established between patience in spending and academic success. 

-  The impact on relatively poorly achieving pupils in school was a more pronounced 36% \[S6\]. 

 This programme is the first single financial literacy education and social responsibility project by ING for Turkey's elementary school students, and encourages positive behavioural changes addressing low personal rates of saving and the lack of financial literacy. Since ING has been running Orange Drops, 1,213 teachers have taught the programme in 329 schools, benefiting 38,835 schoolchildren \[S7, S8\]. 

 **Cultivating non\-cognitive skills in students in North Macedonia** 

 Professor Alan was invited to be an academic advisor for the second phase of a World Bank funded project in North Macedonia \(titled ‘Learning By Doing’\) cultivating socio\-emotional skills in 8<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade students. Building on existing research \[R1, R3\], as well as the successful interventions on grit and perseverance in Turkey, Professor Alan contributed to the design of a unique curriculum on socio\-emotional skills which concentrated on expanding the existing program and introduced a unique mentorship component in the second phase \[S9\]. Alan generated intervention materials to be used in schools in North Macedonia that focused on socio\-emotional skills developed to close gaps in education and labour markets \[R4, R6\]. Professor Alan designed and ran the evaluation, the measurement instruments and analysis of the intervention programme between February 2019 and May 2019. The objective of Learning By Doing was to implement a mind\-set intervention as part of the current high school curricula to cultivate growth mind\-sets and students ability to set goals and act on their intentions amongst 8<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade students in a subset of schools in North Macedonia. 

 The World Bank confirm: *‘In light of her expertise and success implementing interventions at scale, Professor Alan was invited to collaborate with the World Bank team on the second phase of a socio\-emotional skills program in North Macedonia…Initial results show significant and positive impacts of the intervention on deliberate practice beliefs, growth mindset, curiosity and frustration tolerance for the average student…Results led to the government to start a third phase of work \(postponed due to Covid\-19\) focussing on teachers practices’* \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Michael Keating’s work concerns how the United Kingdom has reorganised its tiers of government and its external relations to the European Union in a post\-sovereignty age, and how these changes articulate with each other. His research has sought to clarify the competing meanings of terminology used during the debates on Scottish independence and Brexit, while recognising that protagonists operate within different conceptual frames and political languages. His impact involves novel forms of dissemination to enable key stakeholders at all levels of discussion to respond to these changes, allowing the public, politicians and state actors to understand the nature, consequences and implementation of decisions taken. This has taken place during a period of extensive constitutional change, and his work has focussed on the competing understandings of Scottish independence, the European Union, and the nature of Brexit. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2013, Keating’s research has covered two broad areas: the redistribution of social and political powers and systems across the different layers of government \(Rescaling\); and the debate around the concept of political union itself \(Post\-sovereignty\) \[P1\-4\]. This ongoing research has enabled the 2013 foundation of the Centre for Constitutional Change \(CCC\), established as part of the ESRC Future of the UK and Scotland programme in the lead up to the Scottish independence referendum of September 2014 \[P1\]. The CCC represents a consortium of researchers from universities in the UK and Ireland. Since its establishment in 2013, Keating, the Centre’s Director, has led an interdisciplinary programme of research in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, examining options for constitutional change, including independence and subsequence implications for the future of the UK and Scotland. 

 Rescaling refers to the migration of functional systems, governing institutions and political competition to new levels above and below the state. Keating’s work examines how rescaling of social and political systems – rather than involving the creation of a ‘blank slate’ on which totally new scalar arrangements can be established – occurs through a conflictual ‘layering’ process in which resultant rescaling strategies interact with, and only partially rework inherited social and political systems. Post\-sovereignty refers to the changing meaning of state sovereignty in an interdependent world. 

 Keating’s work has focussed on the Scottish independence \(2014\) and EU \(2016\) referendums. In both cases, the conceptual frameworks drew on Keating’s work on spatial rescaling and post\-sovereignty. These frameworks have been critical to enable Scottish independence and Brexit to be framed not as absolutes but as changing relationships: indeed, the difficulty in defining exactly what Scottish independence or Brexit have really meant, in terms of social or political systems, is often at the heart of the debate. As part of this framework, Keating, in collaboration with the wider CCC, has examined the political debates from an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing on political science, public policy, social policy, economics, international relations and law. 

 **Constitutional Futures and Models of Policy Making \(2013\-14\)** 

 In 2013, Keating undertook research to explore policy models related to the constitutional debate in Scotland. Rather than aiming to show which model would fair best in a normative \(cost\-benefit\) sense, he looked at the institutional foundations and implications of each to examine what version of Scotland might be adaptable to the Scottish case. As part of this project, Keating examined: 

-  the issue of sovereignty within the UK, which has never definitively been resolved; 

-  the status of the Legislative Consent \(Sewel\) Convention, including the Supreme Court rulings; 

-  whether and how an independent Scotland could join the European Union; 

-  the interpretation of the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland; 

-  the place of England in the changing union; 

-  the scope for a differentiated Brexit for Scotland and Northern Ireland. 

 By introducing comparator cases, including independent states and other autonomous regions he was able to examine key features such as shared identities, long\-term census, social partnership, labour market regulation and tensions among the elements. Ultimately, Keating identified two models of adaptation, the market\-liberal and the social\-investment models \[P2; 1, 5\]. 

 **Changing UK in a Changing Europe \(2015\-17\)** 

 In 2015, Keating was awarded an ESRC\-funded fellowship to examine the impact of changing the UK's relationship to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms on the arrangements in the devolved territories. The project analysed these issues in a form accessible to stakeholders and the public, exploring options for change within the UK and Europe and drawing on comparative experience. In particular, this included the changing territorial constitution of the UK within a changing Europe and the prospects for reform. As part of the project, Keating undertook analysis of: 

-  the economic consequences both of Scottish independence and of Brexit; 

-  the currency and public finance options for an independent Scotland; 

-  public finances in Scotland, tax options and prospects after independence; 

-  the meaning and implications of the UK internal market; 

-  the implications of Brexit for agriculture in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

 Keating focussed on reviewing existing knowledge and dissemination to assess future scenarios for the European Union and the UK's place within it as well as scenarios for constitutional change in the UK itself. This included reviewing different perspectives on Europe among the public, civil society and political parties, and differences in the interests of the component parts of the UK in European policy choices. Keating found that the EU is a key factor underpinning the UK devolution settlement and that membership would allow a more extensive internal devolution than would otherwise be possible \[P3; 2, 3,4\]. 

 **Between two unions. The Constitutional Future of the Islands after Brexit \(2017\-2021\)** 

 Brexit represents an unprecedented event in the history of the European Union and constitutes a real\-time experiment in constitutional reinvention. As such it has taken place in a context with very few rules and unknown outcomes. In 2017, Keating led research exploring the reconfiguration of political, economic and social union after Brexit, in particular, the inter\-relationship between UK withdrawal from the European Union and constitutional change within the UK and Ireland. By undertaking critical examination of claims made by actors in the process he produced a case study, which challenges existing understandings of statehood, sovereignty and union. Keating asked fundamental social questions concerning: 

-  the rescaling of social solidarity; 

-  the meaning of social union; 

-  options for devolution of welfare policies. 

 Keating found that although the ideological foundations of union have been weakening in recent decades, the devolution settlement has been moving towards a form of asymmetrical federalism \[P4\]. 

 Keating’s research has been strongly informed by public opinion. As part of \[P1\-4\] Keating and the wider CCC conducted surveys for both referendums, finding that public opinion on independence was not as polarized as the parties. There was strong support for a middle option which had not been on the ballot paper, although after the referendums the parties moved towards compromise. Combining constitutional analysis with policy studies enabled Keating and the CCC to examine the landscape of an independent Scotland or post\-Brexit beyond formal competences \[1\-5\] with analyses made available here:  [https://threadreaderapp.com/user/CCC\_Research](https://threadreaderapp.com/user/CCC_Research). 

 Keating’s research has ensured provision of impartial, tailored and effective communication to target groups, adjusting messaging to facilitate engagement. Throughout the research has been accompanied by active engagement with policy\-makers, the media and the public, mediated as a two\-way exercise, in which Keating and collaborators were able to inform stakeholders while learning from them about issues, perceptions and priorities. Stakeholders within each project have included policy\-level officials, parliamentarians, professional stakeholders and civil society, including business, trade unions and the voluntary sector, and the general public. Keating facilitated engagement with target groups, through organised events, topical public meetings with participatory elements, and regular engagement with broadcast media and journalists. This work was supported by a strong digital media strategy including release of reports, newsletters and a vibrant social media presence. As a result, Keating has developed an effective and accessible mechanism to communicate findings to non\-academic users in order to inform debate, and in particular to reach the public by providing good analysis in a readily comprehensible form.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The period of deliberations since 2013 has involved considerable constitutional change. Conducting political analysis in 'real time' is challenging, as it requires researchers to anticipate implications in the light of limited evidence. Keating and the wider team at CCC have introduced novel mechanisms to adapt rapidly to policy developments, and to produce substantive, concise and user\-accessible analyses to suit a variety of audiences. These mechanisms have enabled effective communication of on\-going events while retaining a 'big picture' and impartial academic perspective on the development of devolution, the UK state and tis relationship to the EU. The success of this approach, in particular Keating’s focus on end users, is evident in the extent and form of engagement; as a result his research has been picked up by a wide variety of stakeholders at all levels of the constitutional debate: 

 **Enhancing voter understanding** 

 The aim of the CCC is to support the creation of new and effective ways to communicate research findings. The Centre regularly posts online blogs accessible to a wide audience. Since 2013, Keating’s blogs have been viewed over 41, 000 times \[S1\]. In 2014, Keating teamed up with The Hunter Foundation and other leading scholars to produce a free e\-book to answer voters’ questions before the Scottish referendum. This e\-book titled *Scotland’s Decision* was downloaded over 120,000 times in the lead up to the Scottish independence referendum, highlighting its uptake across the public \[S2\].  Due to the success of the first e\-book, a second was released prior to the European referendum titled,  [Britain’s Decision – Facts and Impartial Analysis](https://www.centreonconstitutionalchange.ac.uk/publications/britains-decision-facts-and-impartial-analysis), which involved scholars from the CCC and the David Hume Institute. They identified 19 key questions that underpin the debate and they offer objective, independent analysis of these issues. These books analysed the facts and the relative merits or demerits in an impartial manner to help voters to make their decision. 

 The influence of the CCC can be evidenced in the direction of the Scottish Policy & Research Exchange \(SPRE\), which launched in January 2019 and advocates for policy engagement across the social sciences. SPRE’s Director, Nick Bibby, has stated that his interest in policy engagement was heavily influenced by his time at CCC, building experiences through work in communications and engagement: 

 ‘*the Scottish Policy & Research Exchange would not exist had it not been for the participatory approach to research employed by Michael and the rest of the CCC team. This approach, a participative, iterative attitude to policy engagement, allows researchers to develop insights that can feed directly into policy discussion. Not only is this at the heart of much of SPRE’s work but also informs the way we train and mentor early\-career and other researchers*’ \[S3\]. 

 **Informing civil society organisations** 

 The National Farmers Union \(NFU\), an apolitical membership organisation representing the interests of 9,000 crofting and farming members, in itself is not equipped to comment extensively on how such governance might or could operate upon leaving the European Union and Common Agricultural Policy \(CAP\). In 2019, and on behalf of CCC, Keating provided a research briefing to the Scottish Parliament on the current scope and practice of policy divergence and convergence under the Common Agricultural Policy, the future of agricultural funding and the possible ways in which it might be distributed after Brexit. NFU drew heavily on his academic analysis stating, ‘ *In its consideration of this important issue, NFUS has engaged with the authors of, and subsequently has drawn heavily from, academic and independent analysis published by the Centre on Constitutional Change \[…\] on the operation of devolution and EU competences after Brexit* \[S4\]. 

 **Providing an effective knowledge base to media outlets** 

 Keating has routinely provided interviews for radio and television, including BBC News \(June 2014\), BBC Radio 4, and BBC Radio Scotland \(Dec 2018\). He has also provided impartial contributions to the national and international press, including *The Scots*man, *The Herald* and *Sunday Herald*, and *The Times*, for their coverage of key issues in his area of expertise \[S5\]. As a result of his skilful ability to communicate his ideas, Keating’s value as an analyst and communicator have been recognised with high esteem by media outlets: 

 ‘*Professor Keating was a regular guest on most of these programmes. He was, and is, valued for several reasons:* 

-  *his impartiality as an analyst \[…\] added credibility to his analysis of constitutional matters concerning Scotland and the interminable twists and turns of Brexit* \[S5\] 

-  *His ability to communicate his ideas \[…\] This is a skill which, sadly, is far from universal. Professor Keating was extremely good at explaining his insights and analysis in a way that viewers and listeners could understand*’ \[S5\]. 

 The accessibility and impartiality of Keating’s research has had an impact on policy through his innovative approach and his ability to provide clear, accessible, and unbiased written and oral evidence. This is evidenced by Keating’s role as official advisor to the Scottish Parliament’s European and External Affairs Committee, and his engagement with governance institutions including the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales, House of Commons, House of Lords and European Parliament, on over fifty occasions. Select examples are outlined below: 

 **Advising the tiers of government** 

 Keating has been identified as an informed but neutral arbiter on vexed constitutional matters, and as such has been a trusted advisor to many of the tiers within the British governmental system as demonstrated below: 

 **Welsh Assembly** In 2016, Keating was engaged by the Welsh Assembly to help develop terms of reference in order to produce best practice principles for inter\-institutional working for constitutional legislation and promote citizen engagement \[S6\]. 

 **Scottish Parliament** In 2020, Keating acted as a witness during a debate on the UK Internal Market Bill to the Finance and Constitution Committee on 16<sup>th</sup> September \[S6\] as well as an advisor to the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee \[S8\]. 

 **Select Committee on the Constitution** in 2018, Keating provided independent advice on policy co\-operation and co\-ordination, dispute resolution as well as funding the devolved administrations. 

 **Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee** In 2017, Keating gave evidence to the committee \(Devolution and Exiting the EU and Clause 11 of the EU withdrawal Bill: Issues for Consideration\) \[S6\]. 

 **House of Lord Constitution Committee** Evidence presented by Keating and the wider CCC is cited in the Lords Constitution Committee’s report ‘The Union and Devolution’ \(2015\), with direct links drawn between this evidence and the Committee's recommendations on the development and structure of the union. In this instance, his evidence clarified that manifestation of solidarity goes beyond simple redistribution of resources, stating that in a world where citizens are subject to multiple layers of government, from the European Union to the local level, it would be important to build social cohesion “at all levels”. Keating’s evidence clarified that ‘Good inter\-governmental relations should mean that differences in policy or major implementation decisions are made because of the active decisions of each administration, rather than through a lack of consultation and communication.’ As a result, the Committee recommended that the Cabinet Office, as part of its current review of inter\-governmental structures, consider and report on how a revised Joint Ministerial Committee structure might best be used to facilitate joint policy\-making and co\-ordination \[S7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Leeson’s research uses participatory arts practice to access locally held knowledge to create social and environmental change. Through the community\-based research project *Active Energy,* Leeson’ work has resulted in the following key impacts: \(1\) Increased learning and participation: Leeson collaborated with senior men’s group The Geezers in Bow, East London, activating their life experience, culminative skills and knowledge to rethink technologies and better support themselves, their community and the environment. This resulted in the design and realisation of engineered solutions which utilise tidal power to produce low cost, clean energy; \(2\) Enhanced wellbeing, through increased confidence, self\-esteem and sense of purpose for older participants in the *Active Energy* project; \(3\) Improved understanding, by developing new narratives around water conservation in communities in water\-scarce Rajasthan, India. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Leeson’s research focuses on the role of art in social and environmental change through bringing community\-based knowledge into the public domain. Set against Leeson’s wider body of socially situated art practice, ‘a field that she helped to pioneer’ \(Gregory Sholette, Queens College CUNY, USA; In: Leeson 2017, Cover Endorsement **\[3.1\]**\), is the key research project *Active Energy*. It originated in 2007 as an arts\-based response to research at Queen Mary University of London on the democratisation of technology, which highlighted exclusion of older people from technological development. Leeson’s contribution was to work with The Geezers, a group of retired men based at an AgeUK centre in Bow, East London. The Geezers’ chosen technological focus combined concerns over fuel poverty with what they saw as the obvious solution in the locality, the Thames as a source of tidal power. In 2008 this resulted in *GeezerPower*, an exhibition with a large\-scale visualisation and projected interviews and The Geezers’ contribution to a symposium, where they made the case for the introduction of tidal power to support riverside communities. Since 2012, Leeson’s partnership with The Geezers has developed to design, build and install engineered solutions to resolve environmental issues with local impact and global relevance. 

 In 2013 The Geezers’ ideas relating to the production of low\-cost energy from local resource, supported by engineers Toby Borland and Professor Stephen Dodds at University of East London, resulted in the design and creation of a low budget, small\-scale turbine that functioned effectively in slow\-moving tidal rivers. Installed on a Thames barge opposite the Houses of Parliament \(October 2013\), the turbine was created from readily available parts and open\-source software **\[3.2\]**. This collaboration between artist, engineers and community proved transferable, with the engineers identifying its potential for locations where low\-cost accessible solutions would be advantageous, such as developing countries. 

 *Active Energy* subsequently progressed through the AHRC *Towards Hydrocitizenship* project \(2014\-2017\), researching the contribution of creative processes to the ways citizens related to, and took responsibility for, water in their neighbourhoods. Here, Leeson and The Geezers, with continued engineering input from Toby Borland, addressed river pollution by utilising renewable energy. Floating water wheels were developed and installed on the River Lee at Three Mills \(2017\) and in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \(2019\), utilising tidal flow to drive aerators which oxygenated the water and counteracted the effects of river pollution **\[3.3\]**. The experience of The Geezers, as with many older people, is of being overlooked in terms of their perceived contribution to society. *Active Energy* demonstrates the value of their ideas and opinions in developing solutions to environmental issues and illustrates the benefits of collaboration to harness different perspectives on shared concerns. Integral to this has been the use of inter\-generational workshops and events, extending knowledge and understanding uncovered to influence the learning, thinking and action of wider social groups. For example, The Geezers have acted as mentors for secondary pupils from Bow School; and in 2019 an event in the Olympic Park brought participants and the wider community together with regional environmental policy makers to exchange ideas regarding addressing climate change. 

 *Active Energy* is a case study in Leeson’s monograph *Art:Process:Change – Inside a socially situated practice* \(2017\), exemplifying how processes of community involvement can lead to citizen\-led innovation **\[3.1\]**. Key to Leeson’s methodology is collaboration with local groups where participants determine the focus of the work, in this case the generation of sustainable energy to address local need. The location of the project amongst the East London communities with which Leeson has conducted most of her practice, reflects the notion of ‘situatedness’ examined in her monograph, whereby deep understanding of community dynamics and place enhances the relevance and effectiveness of creative process and output. *Art:Process:Change* also describes the approach developed through *Active Energy* as one that enables a ‘drilling down’ into knowledge held in a particular locale, and in so doing creates solutions applicable to other situations. Art nevertheless remains the overarching discipline, creating meaning while bringing together disparate alliances to realise practical outcomes. Leeson’s chapter ‘Water Power’ in *Water, meaning and creativity: understanding human\-water relationships* \(2018\), recognises this value of ‘unlocking community knowledge’ in East London’s riverside communities, where the practical reality of the Thames sustaining life has persisted for generations **\[3.4\]**. 

 Work undertaken with social scientist Dr. Michael Buser, University of West of England \(UWE\) through *Towards* *Hydrocitizenship*, led to Leeson’s participation \(as Co\-I\) in two further AHRC projects investigating uses of art to address urgent social/environmental issues. *Jal\! Cultures of Water in Rural Rajasthan* \(2017\-2018\) explored how participatory arts practice could contribute to increased understanding of, and present solutions to, water scarcity in Rajasthan, India’s driest state; and *The Art of Healing in Kashmir* \(2020\-2021\) supports children traumatised by political events in Kashmir though puppetry and arts\-based therapies.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *Active Energy* has brought communities together to address local environmental issues, use and develop knowledge, and devise and present solutions, while enhancing well\-being and providing a sense of purpose. The many beneficiaries have included older participants, school and college students and local stakeholders in Bow, East London, as well as NGOs and residents in the desert regions of Rajasthan. The three main areas of impact are: 

  

 **1. Impact on learning and participation: Communities addressing environmental issues through collaborative art practice.** During the impact period *Active Energy* brought together members of the Bow community with local stakeholders to develop engineered solutions to issues affecting their lives and locality. The design and realisation of technical solutions to address environmental challenges not only utilised existing skills and understanding in the community, but developed and built on these to provide a focus for discussion and debate. The Geezers \(approx. 15 members\) became ‘local experts’ on renewable energy and shared their knowledge through their website, talks, and workshops. They report how they have ‘learned a lot about the environment, particularly our local rivers \- not only what they can do for us but what needs to be done to keep them clean and a good habitat for wildlife. We hope that what we have done will contribute to that and serve as a model for others to follow.’ They also describe how the project ‘hasn’t just been for us \[...\] we have spread the word about what we have learned and what we think should be done’ **\[5.1a\]**. They regularly document their involvement in the project on their community website, *Our Bow* **\[5.1b\]** to pass new knowledge and experiences to their peers. Between April 2019 and March 2020, the website attracted 19,753 visitors, 75% over the age of 50. In addition, The Geezers have spoken at *Active Energy* launch events at Tamesis Dock \(8 October 2013\), Three Mills \(13 May 2017\) and the Olympic Park \(20 September 2019\), presented at a virtual symposium with University of Highlands and Islands \(31 May 2017\) and Canal Connections, Leeds \(23 June 2017\), and been interviewed for *The Environment* magazine \(16 November 2018\) and for the book *Culture, Communities and Climate* \(ed. Richard Povall, art.earth, 2020\) \(17 December 2019\). *The Environment* featured *Active Energy* in both its February and November 2019 editions **\[5.2\]**, reporting on The Geezers’ ambition to use tidal power to produce renewable energy for the local area and the challenge represented by the project to lack of involvement by older people in technological development **\[5.2\]**. In 2016, *Active Energy* was awarded RegenSW’s Arts and Green Energy prize recognising ‘the crucial role that creative practitioners play in challenging, deepening and broadening the energy debate’ **\[5.3\]**. 

 Stakeholder involvement in *Active Energy* indicates the wider significance and relevance of this project to discourse around environmental concerns. Each water wheel was funded by £10,000 from the National Lottery and supported by the Canal and River Trust, London Legacy Development Corporation \(LLDC\), and Thames21, a charity which works to protect London’s waterways. The second wheel was installed \(June 2019 – February 20\) in a prominent position at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \(run by LLDC\) between the Aquatics Centre and ArcelorMittal Orbit, where it could be seen from both sides of the river by approximately 2.8 million visitors to the park. For LLDC *Active Energy* ‘provided an opportunity to support a local community project focused on the climate emergency to demonstrate how the Park can also be used to trial and test smaller scale low technology initiatives.’ They highlighted how it presented a way ‘to help improve oxygen levels in the river and demonstrated a simple CleanTech initiative with biodiversity benefits,’ and gave a ‘tangible example of a community innovation initiative, demonstrating to stakeholders including the GLA how we are supporting local communities to be more climate resilient’ **\[5.4\]**. The LLDC also highlighted the intergenerational aspects of *Active Energy* as a reason for their support, as it ‘brought together different groups in the local community, including older people and schools.’ Workshops with The Geezers helped embed knowledge from the project into young people’s learning at nearby Bow School \(13 science students in Jun 2019\) and City and Islington College \(8 engineering students on placement with Canal and River Trust in November 2019\-January 2020\). Bow School describe how students extended ‘their knowledge about ‘energy transfers’’ and described the teaching materials as ‘highly valuable’ and how they will use processes and information from the project ‘every year for the STEM activities;’ with students building ‘these models to enhance their problem solving, mathematical, creative and scientific skills.’ The school is also incorporating the project resources into the energy topic for Key Stage 3 **\[5.5a\]**. Similarly, the City and Islington college will use ‘the project templates, materials as well the workshop instructions \[…\] to plan future workshops with other engineering students,’ reporting how *Active Energy* had given the students ‘an insight into how to work sustainably within their vocational area’ **\[5.6\]**.  At the event to launch the water wheel at the Olympic Park, young and older participants questioned the GLA Senior Manager for Energy and Climate Change, with pupils participating ‘inquisitively in the Question and Answer session enabling them to understand more about the solutions to these problems’ **\[5.5b\]**. 

 **2. Impact on wellbeing: Increased confidence, self\-esteem and sense of purpose** **for** **older participants** *. Active Energy* was developed with members of The Geezers at an AgeUK centre in Bow, Tower Hamlets, one of the UK’s poorest boroughs, where isolation of older people is exacerbated by lack of resources. The Geezers Club was established to counter loneliness and isolation, and involvement in *Active Energy* has supported this aim and provided the group with an increased sense of purpose and worth. In common with many of their peers, this group of retired working\-class men felt the contribution they could make to society was undervalued and overlooked. The Geezers describe how involvement in *Active Energy* has given them a ‘good reason to get together and go out and about to explore places \[…\] and do our research. We have met so many interesting people and feel that the project has broadened our minds as well as our horizons. Most importantly… it was something that we ourselves decided to do and have felt that it is our interest and past experience and skills that has made it all happen.’ They report increased confidence and self\-esteem, highlighting how ‘presenting our ideas to other people and the way they have listened to us has made us feel positive about what we have to offer, even though the ideas of people of our age are often overlooked’ **\[5.1a\]**. At the Three Mills water wheel launch event \(May 2017\), the Chief Executive at AgeUK East London, Jane Caldwell highlighted ‘the value of older people’s experience to the wider society, together with the benefits of creative and purposeful activities to those involved’ **\[5.7\]**. Following installation of the Three Mills water wheel, seven of the group were interviewed. They reported that involvement in *Active Energy* gave a feeling of achievement, sense of purpose and well\-being. They felt ‘part of something’ and it provided ‘something to get up for in the morning.’ They highlighted that the project ‘didn’t put people in boxes,’ but rather valued what each had to offer and gave them an opportunity to have their say. One member of the group described how he was advised to get involved in creative work after enforced retirement following a brain injury. He particularly valued the purposeful nature of the project, which he said ‘stopped him from vegetating’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 **3. Impact on understanding: Changing narratives relating to water management in Rajasthan, India**. For *Jal\! Cultures of Water in Rural Rajasthan* \(2017\-2018\) Leeson, in collaboration with Dr Michael Buser \(UWE\), worked with NGOs Centre for Environment and Development Studies in Jaipur \(CEDSJ\) and Ramkrishan Jaidayal Dalmia Seva Sansthan \(RJDSS\) using community\-based arts to promote traditional solutions to water scarcity in India’s driest state. This project was inspired by Buser’s experience of *Active Energy* as part of *Towards* *Hydrocitizenship,* on which he was a Co\-Investigator. Buser saw *Active Energy* as ‘a prime example of how artists can support communities and individuals in making real change in the world and their lives’ **\[5.9\]**. The project was based in the village of Jhakhoda \(population 3,068\), an area experiencing water challenges whose needs are not being met by modern structures for water distribution. Many experts in India advocate a return to traditional methods of water conservation such as rainwater harvesting; however, community memory of these methods had been lost and there was an urgent need to re\-establish intergenerational communication. Reflecting *Active Energy*, local artists engaged with the community to both uncover and express this knowledge, using traditional cultural forms such as mural painting to which local people readily related as a means of communication. Outcomes included an artwork created as a 10ft by 22ft painted wall mural and as a large fabric scroll, containing the story of the loss of traditional methods of rainwater harvesting and the potential outcomes of their reintroduction. Created over a 10\-day period, the mural became a focal point in the village. It was found that an arts\-based approach ‘increased discussion and engagement on issues of water management within the specific social and cultural context of the village and region’ and ‘inspired a shift beyond purely technical narratives and towards a deeper cultural understanding and expression of water’ **\[5.10a\]**. Residents highlighted the importance of the artwork commenting that after ‘seeing the painting, people will be careful with the water;’ ‘people will become conscious of the value of water and how to use it’; and ‘when it rains, we should make tanks to collect the water and connect our homes to the tanks with pipes, and the rain water collected will be available in our hour of need’ **\[5.10b\].** Referencing the success of utilising arts in this way one participating artist noted, ‘\[I\]t is rare that somebody approaches us from this perspective that the art could contribute in this manner; mostly artists are invited \[…\] for aesthetic purposes, to beautify a place, but not to do this kind of communication. \[…\] I’m going to show pictures of this wall and show it in my village and in my city \[…\] it will motivate them to do it more’ **\[5.10a\]**. The scroll is now used by the NGOs in other villages and ‘describing its value to their outreach efforts,’ the RJDSS manager said ‘usually we take technical drawings which are hard for people to understand but this will make it easier for us to explain it to them in their language using these pictures. Explaining the technical with a cultural tool’ **\[5.10b\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Goldsmiths Prize, awarded to the most adventurous and innovative contemporary novels published in the British Isles, has supported and encouraged new forms of writing, encouraged publishers to take risks, and, in bringing new readers to the work of its winners and shortlistees, helped change attitudes towards kinds of fiction traditionally considered inaccessible. The prize, conceived and run by Dr Tim Parnell, whose work on Laurence Sterne engages with a key moment of creative freedom in the history of the early novel, directly builds on Goldsmiths’ ongoing research into, and creative response to, the eighteenth\-century literary traditions of exuberantly inventive and unconventional fiction. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research informing the impact described in this case study has been undertaken by Dr Tim Parnell, Professor Alan Downie, and Professor Francis Spufford. It belongs to Goldsmiths’ long\-standing tradition of inquiry into the nature of the novel, and comprises critically\-informed creative practice and literary\-historical scholarship. It shares a concern with the characteristics of the ‘new species’ of fiction which emerged in Britain during the eighteenth century. Written before the conventions of the genre were largely fixed in the nineteenth century, such fiction was novel in more than name. 

 The long view of the novel derived from research into its earliest forms and themes enabled the creation of a prize conceived as an intervention into a contemporary literary culture in which the British experimental novel had endured a long period of marginalisation. Notwithstanding the creative daring of eighteenth\-century fiction and the brief flowering of experiment associated with modernism in the last century, the British novel has typically been conservative in comparison to its counterparts in Europe and elsewhere. If the popular novel in the eighteenth century was intrinsically experimental, its twenty\-first century counterparts were most read and admired within the relatively narrow confines of university syllabi. This situation was implicitly encouraged by major book prizes which sought to reward nebulous qualities associated with the idea of the ‘best’ fiction. The Goldsmiths Prize was accordingly created to encourage the writing of, and to bring new readers to, works of fiction truest to the spirit of invention and creative freedom found in the eighteenth\-century novel. 

 Parnell’s work on the eighteenth\-century novel and Laurence Sterne’s contribution to it \(resulting in critical editions of *Tristram Shandy* \(R1\) and *A Sentimental Journey* \(R2\), articles, chapters in books \(R3 & R4\) and the forthcoming *Literary Life*\), naturally expanded into an interest in the experimental traditions in the contemporary novel. Sterne informs the prize as its tutelary spirit, and *Tristram Shandy* serves as a point of reference for the novel genre’s near limitless possibilities. 

 Downie’s research has focussed on the distinctive qualities of eighteenth\-century print culture. He has published monographs on two key novelists of the period, Defoe and Fielding, and his *Oxford Handbook of the Eighteenth\-Century Novel* \(R5\) constitutes a new and significant contribution to current thinking about the nature of the genre. 

 Spufford’s *Golden Hill* \(R6\) draws on the conventions, structure and language of eighteenth\-century fiction. As chair of judges for the 2014 Goldsmiths Prize, he brought to it the conviction that the creative freedoms of the early novel offered a way of energising historical fiction in particular. As he went about his work as judge, he was further inspired by the prize’s implicit search for contemporary writing equal to the challenge laid down in *Tristram Shandy*, and found in the rule\-scrambling tropes of eighteenth\-century novels an ideal vehicle for the ideas about the blurring of boundaries which are central to his novel. *Golden Hill* is the creative counterpart to the critical work of Downie and Parnell. *Golden Hill* won the Costa First Novel Award 2016, the RSL Ondaatje Prize 2017, the Desmond Elliott Prize 2017, and was shortlisted for the Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction 2017.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The debates embodied by these research outputs have been deployed and re\-imagined in the Goldsmiths Prize’s conception and mission. Its distinctiveness in the current ecosystem of British literary prizes stems from its embeddedness in an academic culture of research and creative practice. First awarded in November 2013, the Goldsmiths Prize has always foregrounded its link to Sterne and eighteenth\-century fiction by taking its logo from *Tristram Shandy*: the serpentine line which appears on our website and our social\-media branding points both to Sterne’s inventiveness and to current and future possibilities of creative freedom in the novel form. The prize has had a significant impact in two interrelated areas of literary culture: 

 **1. Writing and Publishing** 

 The prize’s profile and purpose have encouraged authors to experiment by creating a milieu in which innovation is rewarded and valued. Having had her novel rejected by several major publishers because it was perceived as too experimental, the prize’s inaugural winner, Eimear McBride, stressed the value of the award in a largely conservative literary culture: the ‘support that winning the Goldsmiths Prize gave *A Girl is a Half\-formed Thing* changed the entire life of the book. . . . It afforded me the previously impossible opportunity to connect with an interested and engaged readership’ \(IMP1\). McBride’s success and the interest generated by the prize’s other nominees have led publishers to reassess conventional notions that formal innovation and commercial success are antithetical. The ‘miracle’ of the Goldsmiths Prize, according to Ali Smith, is that it has ‘changed the industry’ by persuading traditionally cautious publishers to take ‘risks on works which are much more experimental’ \(IMP2\). Such risk\-taking is manifest in Hamish Hamilton’s willingness to publish the two versions of Smith’s *How to be Both* and Heinemann’s investment in the typographical exuberance of Nicola Barker’s *H\(A\)PPY*. It is evident too in the fact that two of the prize’s winners, McBride and Mike McCormack, who were published by small, independent publishers when their novels were submitted, were taken on by larger publishers \(Faber & Faber and Canongate\) in the wake of their wins. 

 With its focus on innovation, the prize casts its net wider than most other prizes and has consequently been able to generate interest in novels unnoticed by the mainstream literary media. Thus, Kevin Davey’s *Playing Possum* \(Aaaargh\! Press\) received its first review \(in the *New Statesman*\) as a result of being shortlisted in 2017 and Isabel Waidner’s *We Are Made of Diamond Stuff* \(Dostoyevsky Wannabe\) was reviewed in both the *New Statesman* and *The Guardian* following its shortlisting in 2019. Such critical attention brings readers to the books, either directly or because, as one of Hamish Hamilton’s editors, Hermione Thompson, puts it, many ‘booksellers follow the Goldsmiths Prize and value it as a metric of literary interest’ \(IMP3\). The resulting boost to sales is seen most strikingly with novels published by small presses: Philip Terry’s *Tapestry* \(Reality Street\) received ‘a significant spike in sales following the shortlisting’ and has now sold nearly 1000 copies for a publisher whose books ‘normally sell between 100\-200 copies’ \(IMP4\); the publishers of *We Are Made of Diamond Stuff* similarly record a ‘spike in sales’ after shortlisting, together with ‘a lot more interest in international rights and rights in translation’ and an increased ‘interest’ in Waidner’s earlier work \(IMP5\); bookshops ordered over 1000 copies of Galley Beggar Press’s two winning titles, A Girl is a Half\-formed Thing and *Ducks, Newburyport* ‘immediately after the prize announcement’ \(IMP6\). 

###  2. Literary culture 

 It is key to the prize’s conception and purpose that its influence extends beyond the confines of the university, where literary innovation is already valued. To reach new audiences, it is important not only that its nominees should be publicised but also that its informing ethos be amplified and disseminated as widely as possible. This is achieved through the extensive media coverage the prize attracts as well as its partnership with the New Statesman. Shortlist and winner announcements have been covered by the following \(among others\): *The Guardian*, *The* Daily Express *,* The Mail, The New York Times *,* The Telegraph, *The TLS*, the BBC. Apart from giving detailed attention to shortlists and winners, the New Statesman co\-presents the prize’s popular events series, among which the New Statesman/Goldsmiths Prize lecture on ‘Why the Novel Matters’ reaches an audience of thousands through a combination of in\-person attendance and print and online publication. 

 With the additional support of its social media channels \(principally Twitter which currently has over 6,950 followers\), the prize both brings new readers to novels that would not typically have attracted such attention and further shapes literary culture by creating a receptive climate for innovative novels.  As the literary agent, Lucy Luck, puts it, the prize has ‘opened up the conversation about literary fiction in ways’ that few would have predicted before it came into being \(IMP7\). The conversation is most clearly heard in such pieces as Sam Leith’s Guardian article, ‘Why we need difficult books’, which takes its cue from the imminent announcement of the 2018 winner \(IMP8\), but its effects are seen more subtly and significantly in the ways in which Britain’s most influential prize, the Booker, has embraced the language and concerns of the Goldsmiths Prize. Thus, their 2016 chair of judges talked of ‘\[experimentation\]’ as ‘one of \[the prize’s\] criteria’, along with ‘being innovative, being bold, courageous, a willingness to take risks, and being novel within the novel’ \(IMP9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at Bangor University has supported a significant regulatory change in interchange and merchant fees of payment cards in the European Union \(EU\) between 2013 and 2016. Acceptance of card payment platforms by both cardholders and merchants was essential for increasing the use of electronic payments in the EU to integrate payment systems for EU countries. By demonstrating that lowering interchange and merchant discount fees would be beneficial to all parties and by providing evidence critical to EU decision\-making concerned with regulatory changes, Carbo\-Valverde’s research led to reduced fees from June 2015. These changes benefitted all merchants that use electronic payments, and all cardholders and financial institutions across Europe, with annual savings between 2015 and 2017 of EUR1,200,000,000 \(03\-2020\) for EU merchants and EUR587,000,000 \(03\-2020\) for EU consumers. The findings are also directly benefitting other, non\-EU jurisdictions.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The EU payment card market totals 30% of the global market, second only to the USA. Despite this, before 2010, a significant proportion of merchants in the European Union was reluctant to accept card payments due to high interchange and merchant discount fees. ‘Interchange fees’ \(a fee paid by the retailer's bank to the consumer's bank upon the use of credit, debit or prepaid cards\) generally increase the price of goods as retailers incorporate these costs into the prices they charge consumers. Carbo\-Valverde’s research showed that even small reductions in these fees resulted in significant increases in merchant acceptance that were beneficial to all parties \(merchants, consumers and financial institutions\). 

 In a unique empirical case study conducted between 2012 and 2015, led by Carbo\-Valverde at Bangor University in collaboration with the University of Grenada, Spain, researchers explored the effects of lowering interchange and merchant fees in Europe. The research empirically tested the fundamental predictions of the two\-sided market theoretical payment card models regarding the impact of interchange fee reductions on payment card adoption and use. Previous theoretical literature had failed to account of environmental changes \(such as lower technology costs, increased consumer and merchant awareness, and increased scale and scope of economic benefits arising from increased payment volumes\).  Data on merchant acceptance, the number of cardholders, and transaction volumes were used for the first time. Employing the data in this way revealed the effects of changes in interchange and merchant discount fees on merchant acceptance and usage of payment cards. Data were drawn from Spain, a card payment market that had not reached its maturity due to low merchant acceptance, where a lowering of the interchange fees could still result in demonstrable higher merchant acceptance. 

 Several working paper versions \(for official use by banks only and not for publication\) were presented at various high\-level conferences and seminars between 2012 and 2015. These were circulated to both European Commission and European Central Bank officials, informing and influencing key stakeholders at the research stage who would later introduce a new Europe wide regulation affecting credit and debit card markets.  Published in the *Review of Economics and Statistics* in 2016 \[3.1\], the research provides the only existing empirical evidence explaining the distribution of the benefits for merchants, consumers and other stakeholders on how regulatory changes affect the benefits for all market participants. Results showed even small changes to the interchange fees were beneficial in terms of merchant acceptance. For example, a decrease of 10% in the rate of decline in the average interchange fee resulted in an increase of up to 1.4% in the rate of merchant acceptance every quarter the reduction was in place. Also, an increase of 10% in merchant acceptance resulted in an increase of up to 1.7% in the rate of electronic payment volumes. The most significant insight of Carbo\-Valverde’s research was to demonstrate that merchants benefit from a fee reduction in terms of higher payment efficiency, higher sales, and lower merchant fees while consumers benefit from higher convenience and availability of card payment devices at stores, and financial institutions and banks benefit, particularly when acting as issuers, from higher volumes that more than compensated for the fall in fees. 

#####  Other related findings 

 In a related paper \[3.2\], Carbo\-Valverde’s research demonstrated that the merchant acceptance rate of card payments in China was negatively affected by high interchanges fees. Additionally, Carbo\-Valverde’s research \[3.3\] showed that the possibility of using cards at Automated Teller Machines \(ATMs\) to withdraw cash was significantly slowing down the pace of expanding payment cards at shops and retailers.

###  4. Details of the impact 

#####  Influence upon EU institutions, regulation and policy 

 Since 2012, the EU aimed for a more integrated payment systems area on the continent. In this context, expanding the electronic card payments systems was a key part of the strategy since higher efficiency and lower costs for all parties could be achieved. The European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Central Bank \(ECB\) instigated a public debate about how to make a substantial increase in merchant acceptance possible. Carbo\-Valverde presented his research as working paper versions \(subsequently published in 2016, \[3.1\]\) at various high\-level conferences and seminars, for example to the ECB in 2014 \[5.1\]. The audience included ECB officials, European Commission officials, antitrust authority officials and bank representatives of various EU countries, all of whom were relevant parties and policy makers in the later design of the new EU regulation on interchange fees. Following the seminars, the ECB and European Commission used the research to support the design of new regulatory actions and to explain the gains from those new regulations. At the early research stage, as the only existing empirical evidence explaining the distribution of the benefits of regulatory changes for all market participants, Carbo\-Valverde’s working papers were pivotal in influencing the new regulation and have been cited in relevant policy actions. Consequently, a new regulation to lower interchange and merchant fees was formulated and approved, becoming applicable in the EU between 8 June 2015 and 9 June 2016. 

 Various testimonials attest how, as the first empirical research to address the issue of interchange fees, Carbo\-Valverde’s work significantly influenced the EC’s decision to implement the Interchange Fees Regulation and his contributions were central in guiding EC policy development and application. Referring to the influence of Carbo\-Valverde’s work, the Acting Director\-General of Competition of the European Commission states how it ‘has been part of the supportive academic empirical background that the European Commission used for the change in the way interchange and merchant fees were regulated in the European Union… The Impact Assessment study of the European Commission for the Directive on Interchange Fees quotes Mr Carbo\-Valverde’s research that provided evidence for these policy actions’ \[5.2\]. 

 The ECB recommendation \(followed by the EC and the European Parliament\) to lower interchange and merchant discount fees instigated the introduction of regulation by all EU countries to lower those fees and set them close to zero from 2016 onwards.  The Head of the Market Infrastructure Support Division at the ECB \(Directorate General Market Infrastructure and Payments\), emphasised the influence of the research on ‘retail payments policy\-related work of the ECB’. Their testimony demonstrates the use of the research by a former member of the ECB Governing Board ‘in several public statements’ suggesting, overall that ‘Carbo\-Valverde’s research provided research background for that change in regulation \(…\) that affected all banks operating in the EU, all merchants that use electronic payments in the EU, and EU cardholders’. The Head of the Market Infrastructure Support further adds ‘The research was also used as motivation in the impact assessment study of the European Commission and the European Parliament for the Directive on Interchange fees and merchant discount fees’ \[5.1\]. 

 In 2016, the European Commissioner for Competition also used the research to motivate a response to the European Parliament on the convenience to reduce interchange fees in Portugal \[5.3\]. The European Commissioner’s response states: ‘various studies have also shown that interchange fee reductions led to higher card acceptance and usage’ and directly links to a footnote that mentions Carbo\-Valverde’s research. 

 A Senior Economist of the Central Bank of the Netherlands stated that the research ‘has also produced a significant impact for academic discussion and among central banks and regulatory bodies’. He  adds: ‘… these results \(those of Carbo\-Valverde\) were cited by different and European authorities and were considered and explicitly mentioned in the impact case study of the European Commission and European Central Bank as a basis for the directive on Interchange Fee Regulation and merchant discount fees. The directive implied a fundamental change for all market participants in the card payment network in the EU countries. It affected 100% of banks operating in the European Union, 100% of merchants that use electronic payments in the EU and 100% of EU cardholders’ \[5.4\]. 

#####  Significance of economic effects 

 Earlier versions of the research \(for official use only and not for distribution\) were already considered as an indication of potentially significant economic effects and informed the findings of the impact assessment study of the EC and the European Parliament for the Directive on Interchange Fees \[5.5\]. The subsequent benefits of implementation of the 2015 EU Interchange Fees Regulation for consumers and merchants are widespread. Notably, by reducing the costs of card payments retailers pay less for such transactions, allowing consumers to use cards more widely, paving the way for innovative payment technologies to be rolled out \[5.6\]. The EC study on the application of the Interchange Fee Regulation \(IFR\) \(impact study of 2020\) corroborates the large benefits of the regulation change: ‘the increase in the usage of commercial cards has also been confirmed by merchants …. \(a\) majority …. \(86%\) that responded to the survey declared that the relative share of transactions performed with commercial cards has increased since entry into force of the IFR. More precisely, 54% of merchants reported an increase in commercial card transactions between 0 and 10%, 18% declared an increase above 10%’ \[5.7\]. The impact study concludes that after the implementation of the new EU interchange fee regulation there is significant evidence of card payments gradually replacing cash payments. Focusing on end\-users \(consumers and merchants\), this increase has resulted in estimated annual benefits \(between 2015 and 2017\) of EUR1,200,000,000 \(03\-2020\) for merchants and EUR587,000,000 \(03\-2020\) for consumers \[5.7\]. 

#####  Influence in other jurisdictions 

 Finally, the impact of Carbo\-Valverde’s research has more recently expanded to non\-EU countries. Several non\-European government agencies have cited Carbo’s Valverde research in the context of their changes in interchange fee regulations. These include the USA Federal Reserve \(introduction of a new regulation called the US Debit Card Interchange Regulation in the context of the Durbin Amendment, 2017\) \[5.8\], the Bank of Canada \(2019\) \[5.9\] and the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs of Malaysia \(2018\) \[5.10\]. All these countries have lowered or set a limit on interchange fees since 2017. These institutions cite Carbo\-Valverde’s research as the empirical background to demonstrate the benefits of lowering interchange fees.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 A key challenge for manufacturers has been to reduce the requirements for rare earth metals such as neodymium, dysprosium and terbium in the magnets used in electric vehicles as they are expensive and difficult to obtain. Working collaboratively with Toyota and a range of other partners in the EU and Japan, Professor Hrkac’s group at the University of Exeter has played a crucial role in the development of magnetic materials which require significantly lower levels of rare earth metals. These materials have been employed in an estimated 6.5 million hybrid vehicles produced by Toyota since 2016, **reducing consumption of rare earth elements by 450 tonnes**, with associated reductions in environmental damage. In addition, the use of the new magnetic materials has contributed to efficiency gains compared to standard hybrid vehicles which have **reduced carbon dioxide emissions from Toyota hybrid vehicles by 11 million tonnes** worldwide since 2016.  Professor Hrkac’s work also contributed to **cost savings of $108M in production and maintenance costs for hybrid cars** which enhanced job stability at Toyota and generated savings for consumers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Prof. Hrkac’s research group focuses on computational and theoretical magnetism; specifically, the development of models to investigate the complex interface effects on an atomistic scale in nano\- and micro\-scale materials. Magnetic materials are formed from grains with a distinct magnetic structure. For most applications it is the overall magnetic material properties which are important; these are determined by the interaction between grains, so interfaces and grain boundaries ultimately determine the useful magnetic properties such as the external magnetic field, magnetic flux and magnetic energy density. 

 Supported by a Royal Society University Research Fellowship \(2009\-2014\), Prof. Hrkac developed *ab initio* simulations of atomic structures and solid\-state molecular dynamics to model the behaviour of amorphous and crystalline grain boundaries in neodymium \(NdFeB\) magnets. In this early work it was shown that for Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B magnets, containing neodymium \(Nd\) but without rare earth element dysprosium \(Dy\), the coercivity was highly dependent upon local anisotropy profiles at grain boundaries **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. The significance of grain boundaries, highlighted by Prof Hrkac's work, was central to future magnet development. Further research highlighted the importance of Nd\-oxides **\[3.3\-3.5\]** and the potential for using structured magnetic materials **\[3.6\]**. 

 One of the key challenges in designing high efficiency magnets for use in hybrid and electric vehicles is that they must be able to operate at high temperature, whilst maintaining or improving the efficiency of the electric motors they are used to drive. When neodymium magnets are used at high temperatures, such as in automotive applications, other rare earth elements such as dysprosium or terbium \(Tb\) are generally added to increase high\-temperature coercivity. However, these are rare and expensive metals found in locations with high geopolitical risks. Because of this, considerable efforts have been made to develop magnets that do not use these metals. Although production volumes of neodymium are relatively high amongst rare earth metals, there are concerns that shortages will develop as electric vehicles become increasingly popular in the future. To overcome the issues regarding cost and availability of rare earth metals, Toyota established its Magnetic Materials for High\-Efficiency Motors \(MagHEM\) project in 2012, with the aim of developing technologies that would initially eliminate the use of terbium and dysprosium, and in the longer\-term reduce the amount of neodymium used, whilst maintaining the high levels of heat resistance and minimizing loss of coercivity. 

 As a result of his expertise, Prof. Hrkac played a leading role in the MagHEM project **\[5.1\]**, providing all the interface materials modelling, with colleagues in Europe and Japan responsible for other elements such as fabrication and testing. The first phase of the research led to the development of magnets requiring very low levels of dysprosium/terbium, which were used by Toyota in its 4th generation Prius, released in December 2015 \(Figure 1\) **\[5.2\]**. 


 Figure 1: Reduction of Tb/Dy from 3<sup>rd</sup> generation to 4<sup>th</sup> generation Prius. Figure adapted from **\[5.2\].** 


 The next phase of the work focused on reducing the neodymium content required, through the combination of three new technologies, all of which were dependent on Prof Hrkac’s modelling: 

 **I. Magnetic grain refinement** – high coercivity can be retained at high temperatures through the reduction of the size of the magnet grains to one\-tenth or less of those found in conventional neodymium magnets and the enlargement of the grain boundary area. This is shown in Figure 2 **\[5.2\]**, where the performance of the neodymium\-reduced magnet \(solid red line\) is seen to out\-perform the conventional neodymium magnet \(black line, squares\) at higher temperatures. Moreover, simply reducing the amount of neodymium, without changing the grain size significantly, reduces the magnet performance \(black line, diamonds\); 

 **II. Two\-layered high performance grain surface** – neodymium can be used more efficiently by increasing its concentration on the surface of the magnet grains and decreasing the concentration in the grain core, which results in a reduction in the overall amount of neodymium required whilst maintaining high levels of coercivity;

 * **III. A specific alloying ratio of lanthanum and cerium** –** normally, alloying neodymium with lanthanum and cerium results in a significant decline in its key properties of heat resistance and coercivity. However, by evaluating a range of alloy ratios, Toyota identified a specific ratio at which the deterioration of properties was minimised. 

 This programme of research and development led to the production by Toyota in 2018 of the world’s first neodymium\-reduced, heat resistant magnet, which uses no terbium or dysprosium \(Figure 2\). This new magnet has a wide range of potential applications in motors that require relatively high output; Toyota indicated that the magnets would be used in electric power steering motors for cars in the early 2020s, with plans for further development to enable their application in high performance electrified vehicle drive motors within the next 10 years \(i.e. by 2028\). **\[5.2\]**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Electric vehicles are an important element in meeting global goals on climate change, with hybrid vehicles fulfilling a key role in the transition period whilst charging infrastructures are put in place. This was re\-emphasised in February 2020 when the UK government announced a ban on petrol and diesel cars by 2030.  In 2019, just over 5.4 million hybrid and electric cars were sold worldwide, with a total market value of \~$160Bn. The market value is forecast to increase to almost $540Bn by 2024 **\[5.3\]**. Toyota Motor Corporation is a leading manufacturer of hybrid electric cars. In 2019 over 99.9% of Toyota’s electric vehicle sales were hybrids **\[5.2\]**. In the same year, Toyota sold 1.9 million hybrid vehicles worldwide \(35% of the total market\) **\[5.2\]**. 

 A key challenge for manufacturers has been to reduce the requirements for rare earth metals such as neodymium, dysprosium and terbium in the magnets used in electric vehicles, as they are expensive and difficult to obtain. As a key member of the MagHEM project, Prof Hrkac’s group at the University of Exeter has played a crucial role in the development of magnets which require significantly lower levels of rare earth metals, resulting in the major environmental and economic benefits detailed below and summarised in Figure 3. 

 **Decreased environmental damage through reduced use of rare earth metals – reduction of 450 tonnes dysprosium since 2016:** The mining of rare earth metals used in conventional hybrid motors negatively impacts the environment and surrounding communities, creating toxic waste and damaging the surrounding environment **\[5.9\]**. Furthermore, global supplies are limited, and demand is exceeding supply, with reserves expected to run out in the next five years. By using the newly developed low\-dysprosium magnet in its 4<sup>th</sup> generation Prius and other hybrid electric vehicles since 2016, Toyota has reduced consumption of dysprosium by an estimated 450 tonnes\*, reducing the carbon footprint and the environmental damage associated with production of these vehicles. In the short term, this work has freed up the limited dysprosium supplies for use in other vital applications such as wind turbines. In the longer term, it has made a lasting difference by demonstrating that it is possible to use alternatives to the rare earth metals traditionally used in electric vehicles. 

 In addition, by bringing magnet production in\-house during the joint development project, Toyota has been able to instigate a recall programme aimed at recycling electromotors and recovering rare earth materials to further limit environmental impact in the future **\[5.10\]**. 

 *\* The estimated 450 tonnes saving is calculated from an 84% reduction \(Figure 1\) in dysprosium, i.e. from 83g per car \[see Hoenderdaal, et al. \(2013\), Energy Vol. 49, Pages 344\-355\] to 13g per car. Scaling the saving by 6.5 million cars produced since 2016 gives the estimated figure.* 


 *Figure 3: Summary of impacts from new magnetic materials in hybrid cars.* 


 **Decreased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to increased fuel efficiency – 11 million tonnes less CO<sub>2</sub> since 2016:** The use of newly developed magnetic materials contributed to reductions in the size of the motor \(35%\) leading to improvements in motor efficiency of 20% **\[5.4\]**. Together with other design refinements, this enabled Toyota to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in its 4<sup>th</sup> generation Prius by 21% **\[5.2\].** Assuming similar levels of efficiency savings on their other hybrid vehicles, this has led to estimated savings in carbon dioxide emissions of 11 million tonnes since 2016. This saving in CO<sub>2</sub> is equivalent to the average yearly emission associated with more than 1.8 million homes **\[5.5\].** Efficiency savings from these new magnetic materials are also projected to be more significant in the future in applications such as robotics and fully electric cars **\[5.1\]**. 

 **Decreased production costs leading to increased confidence in the market, greater job stability at Toyota and savings for consumers**:* The reduced use of rare earth metals results in significant reductions in production costs: for example, the decreased levels of dysprosium used since 2016 has resulted in estimated cost savings of $108M \(estimated from the 450 tonnes saving, see above, and the $240/kg market value of dysprosium **\[5.6\]\).** This will translate into cheaper access to electric vehicles for consumers as well as increased confidence for automotive manufacturers that they can acquire the resources needed for future production of electric vehicles. Furthermore, the newly developed magnets have improved durability, leading to reduced maintenance costs over the lifetime of the vehicle, another positive benefit for consumers. Toyota has benefitted in other ways as well: by moving the development and production of magnets in\-house \(Prof Hrkac has also worked closely with Toyota on this project and has trained Toyota engineers in simulation techniques\); it has acquired intellectual property rights in this area **\[5.7\];** and has security over future production. This has contributed to job stability and sustainability at the company. 

 **Wider implications for neodymium reduced magnets:** This case study has focused on the impacts that have been delivered to date by Toyota through the use of improved, low\-dysprosium magnets in its hybrid and electric vehicles \(Figure 2\). However, in 2018 and as noted above, further development based on Prof Hrkac’s research has also led to the production by Toyota of the world’s first neodymium\-reduced, heat resistant magnet, which uses no terbium or dysprosium \(Figure 1\). Toyota indicated that the magnets would be used in electric power steering for cars in the early 2020s, with plans for further development to enable their application in high performance electrified vehicle drive motors within the next 10 years \(i.e. by 2028\) **\[5.2\]**. In addition to applications in hybrid and electric vehicles, the magnets will have wider potential use in robots and other household appliances, a huge and growing market: the household robots market is expected to grow from $3.3Bn in 2019 to $9.1Bn by 2024 **\[5.8\].** 

 **Summary statement:** Working collaboratively with Toyota and a range of other partners in the EU and Japan, Prof Hrkac has played a crucial role in modelling and development of new magnetic materials which require significantly lower levels of rare earth metals. These novel materials have been employed in an estimated 6.5 million hybrid vehicles produced by Toyota since 2016. This has reduced the consumption of rare earth elements by 450 tonnes, with associated reductions in environmental damage, reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from Toyota hybrid vehicles by 11 million tonnes and contributed to efficiency gains which have led to cost savings of $108M

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hingorani’s practice as Co\-Artistic Director of Brolly, a global majority led company, addresses the under representation of BAME artists and audiences in the Arts and Heritage sector, producing substantial impact in four key areas: 

  

-  Revolutionising the Eurocentric opera form by integrating global majority classical traditions. 

-  Creating BAME characters and new roles in the opera repertoire for BAME artists 

-  Re\-articulating archival research through performances that decolonise British heritage. 

-  Developing BAME audiences for opera and the heritage sector. 

 This work is delivered through partnerships with theatres and museums nationally, including The National Maritime Museum, Hackney Empire and Opera North, and supported by Arts Council England.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 



 Hingorani’s work challenges the pe rception of opera as a culturally elitist art form by placing BAME characters centre stage and integrating ‘non\-Western’ and vernacular musical traditions into the form. By decolonising the Eurocentric heritage of opera, the work purposely confronts what Homi K. Bhabha calls the ways ‘imagined communities’ are given essentialist identities. 

  

 Figure 1 Performance of Powder Monkey 

Brolly Productions’ culturally inclusive performance practice is exemplified in the creation of two new mid\-scale national touring opera works: *Clocks 1888: the greener* \( **R3**, **G1, G3**\) and *The Powder Monkey* \( **R5, G2, G3**\), both of which demonstrate pioneering approaches to decolonising opera, rehearsal methodologies and the use of archives. 

 Hingorani’s previous work documents the contributions of minority community practitioners, both in academic writing and in his staging BAME characters in national touring productions such as *Guantanamo Boy* \( **R1**, **R2**\). 

  

 **Decolonising opera:** The operas place BAME characters centre stage to dramatise the ‘hidden’ histories of marginalised communities, creating leading roles for BAME artists and musicians in the repertoire and cultivating BAME audiences for opera. Brolly’s work revolutionises the Eurocentric classical ‘high’ art genre by integrating non\-Western classical musical traditions with vernacular musical forms to create an accessible hybrid form that destabilises racist notions of cultural ‘otherness’. 

  

 **Decolonising the rehearsal:** Hingorani has progressed a rehearsal methodology that is inclusive of ‘other’ musical traditions and languages facilitating collaboration between artists and musicians from ‘Western’ and ‘Non\-Western’ classical and vernacular traditions. This practice method empowers non\-Eurocentric classically trained musicians, such as South Asian or West African, who typically improvise and play /sing ‘by ear’ to work collaboratively with ‘Western’ trained musicians who often ‘read’ or sight sing music. Further, this enables the composer to create a score that integrates these traditions to culturally democratise the form. 

  

 **Decolonising the archive:** Brolly re\-articulates Eurocentric archival materials through performance to stage BAME community histories, contest their marginalisation, insist on their historiographical presence and decolonise the museum space. These collaborative partnerships include the National Maritime Museum’s ‘Atlantic Gallery’, Chatham Historic Dockyard, Hackney Museum and the British Museum that ensure accessibility and engagement for diverse audiences with the performance and the institution. The socio\-culturally grounded, historically accurate and authentic BAME characters that are ‘performed back’ to BAME audiences radically empowers marginalised groups in the creation and consumption of art. 

  

 **Decolonising praxis**: Hingorani’s research and creative productions work within the philosophical framework of post\-colonial scholars such as Hall, Bharucha, Gilroy, Brah and Bhabha. The operas function as cultural ‘counter narratives’ that contest racist and discriminatory constructions perpetuated historically through British art and culture. This culturally inclusive praxis is predicated on treating ‘white’ as an ethnicity in the same way as ‘other’ ethnicities, to create a musically hybrid and open space. \( **R4**\)

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Inclusion of underrepresented audiences** 

  

 *“I believe for many people in the audience it was their first experience of Opera. Lots of people were commenting how accessible the performance was. It would be great to bring the performance back to Newham next year.”* 

 Mohamed Hammoudan, Director of Resident Engagement and Participation, London Borough of Newham **\(S1\)**. 

  

 Brolly’s accessible opera form reached new BAME audiences through the mounting of national tours. In turn, this enhanced public sector understanding of BAME history and disseminated ‘non\-Western’ musical traditions. \( **S2**\) 

  

 *Clocks 1888: the greener* was part of Alchemy on Tour, the largest celebration of South Asian culture outside of India, performing at the CAST theatre, Doncaster in 2015, and subsequently part of a national tour in 2016, increasing the regional access to contemporary opera featuring BAME characters. Performances at the Hackney Empire and CAST Theatre Doncaster reached 12,000 people digitally, as well as over 1500 live audience members and 900 participants of participation\-widening events. \( **S3**\) 

  

 *The Powder Monkey* was performed at the National Maritime Museum, Chatham Historic Dockyard, The Albany Empire, Deptford and Newham Town Hall, reaching audiences of 3,880 and including 2,085 participants. \( **S4**\) 

  

 Other performances were specifically aimed at traditionally inaccessible or excluded audiences; for example, the performance of *Powder Monkey* at Newham Town Hall as part of Black History Month 2019, in one of the most demographically mixed \(71% BAME\) boroughs of London. 

  

 **Inclusion of BAME artists** 

  

 *“By working in an operatic form, with a diverse cast, in a black led company, this production is an essential part of redefining opera: whose stories are represented on the opera stage; who creates and tells them.”* 

 Jo Nockels, Head of Projects, Opera North. \( **S5**\) 

  

  

 The two new operatic works directly address the lack of leading roles for BAME artists, both singers and musicians, in the repertoire. The two operas created five leading roles for BAME singers and orchestral parts for two musicians specialising in the Kora and Sitar. These creative opportunities have fostered the development of casting networks for BAME artists, bringing them to the attention of major opera companies such as English National Opera, the Royal Opera House and Opera North. 

  

 Overall, Brolly created industry standard employment, following Independent Theatre Council \(ITC\) guidelines, for 40 artists in the development and performance of *The Powder Monkey* and 23 artists for *Clocks 1888: the greener,* as result of successful funding bids from Arts Council England and a range of trusts and foundations \(over GBP200,000\). 

  

 **Making museums more inclusive of BAME audiences.** 

  

 *“Thank you so much for giving such a rich and valuable experience to the kids\! Inspiring the next generation of opera stars in a London borough where 34% of children live in poverty.”* 

 Emma Winch, Heritage Learning Manager, Hackney Museum \( **S6**\). 

  

 The company’s research expertise in increasing access to under\-represented BAME audiences was underpinned by their partnerships with national and local museums, such as; 

  

 **Hackney Museum, London**: the ‘Opera Audiences of The Future’ symposium at Hackney Museum \(19 April 2016\) featured a performance of Clocks 1888: the greener that gave primary schools in the borough access to BAME archives. 

 **National Maritime Museum, London**: In partnership with music education hubs such as Greenwich, Brolly developed school audiences for the National Maritime Museum, contributing to the National Plan for Music, and creating networks with local primary schools \(Millennium, Windrush and Bannockburn\) with high BAME constituencies, achieving the maximum 450 capacity at all performances of ‘The Powder Monkey’ for these audiences \(4\-5 November 2019\). The development of The Powder Monkey was also utilised to engage BAME audiences with the Atlantic Gallery archive at the National Maritime Museum through national events such as International Slavery Remembrance Days for three consecutive years \(23 August 2017 \- \( **S7**, **S8**\) 

  

 **British Museum, London:** Brolly Productions was invited to perform in the Horology Gallery, and to host a symposium featuring a performance from Clocks 1888: the greener entitled ‘Opera Clocks and the Collection’ in 2015 \( **S9**\). This established dialogue between the museum’s curatorial staff and public engagement team on how performance can engage with archives and help to develop BAME audiences for the museum.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Jill Peay’s research addresses the core issue of fairness in the criminal justice system, by providing a legal mechanism for ensuring that those who cannot be tried fairly are not exposed to conviction and punishment. Peay and her collaborators have developed a psychometrically sound method of assessing an accused person’s ability to plead to an indictment, to understand court proceedings, to follow trial evidence, and to participate effectively in their trial. This novel instrument continues to be subject to real\-world testing and will require training for its clinical use. The research underpinning the instrument has been endorsed by the Law Commission and has informed its draft legislation on unfitness to plead. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The prison population for England and Wales has consistently exceeded 80,000 in recent years. Even setting aside those prisoners whose physical conditions may also have affected the fairness of their trials, some 90% of prisoners notably have one or more of five diagnosable mental health disorders \(Singleton et al 1998; Fazel and Danesh 2002; Peay 2014\). This can only cast doubt on the fairness of some of their convictions, whilst also questioning the continuing applicability of the leading 19<sup>th</sup> century case on unfitness, *R v Pritchard* \(1836\) 7 C. & P. 303. 

 Government, legal practitioners, civil liberties advocates, and academics have all expressed concern about this state of affairs. In response, the Law Commission initiated a programme of reform to address these issues and the incompatibility of our law with the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\). Following an initial meeting with Peay, Dr Nigel Blackwood \(Institute of Psychiatry\), and Dr Michael Watts \(UCL\), the Law Commission supported the successful grant application to the Nuffield Trust to enable this team to undertake a cross\-disciplinary project to develop a psychometrically sound method of assessing an accused person’s ability to plead to an indictment **\[1\]**. This project commenced in 2009, with a grant of just under GBP200,000 \(see Section 5, **\[A\]**\). 

 Peay brought to the research project her special expertise in the fields of mental health and crime. Her principal role was that of providing the expertise necessary to design and test a legally appropriate instrument for determining the core cognitive abilities an accused person would need to participate meaningfully in the trial process **\[2\]**. In consultation with legal and clinical practitioners, a script was developed for a typical short court case and a testing instrument was devised to probe an accused person’s understanding of the trial and the court process. The script was cross\-checked for authenticity with senior judges and filmed with professional actors. The point of view adopted was that of the defendant **\[1\]**. 

 The resulting film was then shown to some 200 “normal” participants and to groups representing people who might experience difficulties with trial proceedings, such as those with learning disabilities and mental health problems. Peay assisted specifically in the task of identifying qualifying normal subjects in the “difficult to locate” more mature age range \(64\-81yrs\). Participants in the exercise were required to put themselves in the position of the defendant. As the film progressed, they were asked a series of questions set out in the accompanying legally informed instrument. As a result of this testing phase amendments were made to the instrument. A second round of testing was held, with a further 160 subjects, leading to a validated test of fitness to plead. 

 As the legally qualified member of the research team, Peay was influential in refining this instrument. The methodological challenges the team addressed included taking into account participants’ previous experiences of the criminal justice system, making the instrument gender\-neutral, and considering the role of the instrument among participants faking cognitive impairment \(legal malingering\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research outlined above has informed legal debate related to establishing an accused person’s fitness to plead, and can be shown to have consistently influenced the Law Commission’s work on this subject. This influence can be seen in the sequence of Law Commission documents described below, beginning with the initial Consultation Paper in 2010 but most evident throughout the REF 2021 period, in the Commission’s 2014 Issues Paper **\[I\]** and culminating in its 2016 Final Report and Draft Bill \( **\[B\]** and **\[C\]**\). 

 In 2014, the Law Commission published *Unfitness to Plead: An Issues Paper*, to solicit the views of those with experience of the criminal justice system, ahead of making its final recommendations to government. With respect to developing a defined psychiatric test to assess a defendant's decision\-making capacity, the Issues Paper explicitly endorsed this research: “ *No standardised model was put forward in the \[Consultation Paper\], but we endorsed research being conducted into such a formulation*” **\[I**, para.4.7 **\]**. The research referred to here, and cited in a footnote, is that which was later published in **\[1\]**. 

 Following consultation \( **\[G\]** and **\[H\]**\), the Law Commission published its revised proposals in a final report in January 2016, together with a Draft Bill. Peay’s contributions are recognised in the report’s acknowledgements **\[B**, para.1.120 **\]**, alongside those of her collaborators and other academics consulted. The report then goes on to reference Peay’s contributions a further 32 times, noting her input to a number of issues under consideration. A fitness to plead psychiatric test based on the project’s findings was one of the key planks in these proposals, noting its benefits in terms of increased time and cost efficiencies: “ *An initial assessment might obviate the need, in some cases, for a full report to be prepared, with all the attendant costs and delays, or at least identify more clearly the appropriate expert to approach. We hope that the work currently being conducted on screening tools might also assist in making screening robust and effective*” **\[B**, para.4.72 **\]**. Again, the underpinning research is referenced. 

 The importance of the identification and screening of defendants with unfitness to plead or capacity issues is demonstrated by government funding commitments. As the Law Commission Report **\[B**, para 1.3 note 7 **\]** observes: “ *On 6 January 2014 the Government announced an additional GBP25 million spending on liaison and diversion services for police stations and magistrates’ courts in ten areas across England, with a view to rolling out the scheme nationwide in 2017. This scheme has the potential to revolutionise the identification and screening of defendants with unfitness to plead or capacity issues*”. 

 The developed instrument has the potential to improve the current practice for assessing fitness to plead under the *Pritchard* criteria. More importantly, it directly addresses a key initial objective of the Law Commission’s programme of reforms insofar as it can be used to reframe assessments in accordance with the ECHR requirements of “effective participation” in trial processes \( *SC v UK* \(2005\) 40 EHRR 10\), thus responding directly to a key initial objective of the Law Commission’s programme. As Bevan and Ormerod note with respect to the Law Commission’s proposals: “ *A critical element of a reformed framework was felt to be the accurate and efficient identification of those few defendants who lack the capacity to participate effectively in trial*” **\[D\]**. The fitness to plead instrument which arises out of this research explicitly addresses that capacity. 

 Following the Law Commission’s proposals being issued to government, a response was received in June 2016 from the Rt Hon Mike Penning MP, Minister of State at the Justice Department, which welcomed the “ *balanced and thorough consideration of how to ensure that defendants who lack the capacity to participate in trial are dealt with appropriately in the criminal courts*"" **\[F\]**. Recommendations remain under consideration, whilst the issues remain prominent for lawyers \(see Max Hill QC, DPP\) **\[K\]** and in the Court of Appeal \(see *Marcantonio* \[2016\] EWCA Crim 14 and *Holloway* \[2016\] EWCA Crim 2175\). Clinicians have recommended field trials of the Law Commission’s proposals, augmented by use of test instruments **\[L\]**. 

 The instrument has subsequently been put into “real\-world” testing in the Magistrates’ Court by Dr Penny Brown at the Institute of Psychiatry. Brown, a clinician, is one of the authors of the 2018 publication **\[1\]**. She has been using the instrument in her doctoral research. Peay has been acting as one of three key investigators/collaborators on this PhD \(separately supervised at the Institute of Psychiatry, KCL\). 

 Assessment of the wider impacts of this instrument remains under consideration. However, facilitating a fairer and more efficient trial process that balances the rights of vulnerable defendants, whilst protecting the interests of complainants and the public from harm, can only enhance confidence in the criminal justice system. The research has had a direct impact on the Law Commission’s views **\[E\]**; evidence of impaired capacity to participate is a key concept in its *Criminal Procedure \(Lack of Capacity\) Bill* **\[C\]**. The Bill’s novel proposals would address many of the problems outlined above.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Through practice\-as\-research, publications, exhibitions, masterclasses, print portfolios, international collaborations and global networking, Croft has enhanced understanding of contemporary printmaking and provided new opportunities for public audiences to experience and engage with such practices. His projects have enabled British printmakers to achieve recognition in China, Australia and the USA, while assisting Chinese artists to exhibit and network beyond China, opening up their work to global markets. 

 Globally and regionally his initiatives and outputs benefit professional artists and art students, museums and galleries, print collectors and the general public. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since the publication of his influential technical manuals *Stone Lithography* \[3.1\] and *Plate Lithography* \[3.2\], Croft has continued to disseminate his knowledge of and communicate his enthusiasm for printmaking through the curation of international touring exhibitions and participation at conferences, workshops and print festivals worldwide. 

 Examining the interrelationships between technical, historical and cultural aspects of printmaking, and lithography in particular, is fundamental to Croft’s research. In its technical dimensions, including attention to hybrid approaches such as traditional woodcut and modern screenprint, research for *Contemporary Chinese Printmaking* \[3.3\] considerably expands on Croft’s work on international contemporary lithography for his AHRC\-funded project *Stone\-Plate\-Grease\-Water* \[3.4\]. It also extends his practical investigations into the relationships between art and technology, such as the digitisation of lithography \(2008–2013\) \[3.5.1–6\]. Croft’s ongoing study of the interdependence of artists and their printers, and the extent to which such relationships have shaped lithographic practice, lays the foundation for his Leverhulme\-funded research for *British Lithography 1800–2020: The Role of Collaboration in Practice* \[3.6\]. 

 Croft’s practice\-as\-research is underpinned by a continued regeneration and reassessment of his training as a Master\-Printer at the world\-renowned Tamarind Institute of Lithography in Albuquerque. As Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter\-Printmakers who has considerable experience as an artist, collaborating printer and educator, his research into methods, materials and the application of traditional as well as innovative techniques is enriched by a sustained engagement with contemporary practices worldwide. 

 Initiating *Contemporary Chinese Printmaking* \[3.3\] involved establishing professional and academic contacts in China and meeting with artists and representatives of academic and cultural institutions in Hunan Province to identify shared approaches to practice, research interests and values. The research aims of this exploratory visit, which was facilitated by funding from the Welsh Government’s Strategic Insight Programme and Hunan Department of Education’s Famous Foreign Professors project, were to map out a series of exchange exhibitions as well as to set up workshops, print portfolios and artist residencies. 

 *Contemporary Chinese Printmaking*, the centrepiece of the collaborative project, investigated the practice of three generations of printmakers from Hunan Province. It was primarily concerned with gaining an understanding of traditional and non\-traditional Chinese woodcut methods as well as etchings, screenprints, lithographs, and digital prints. It examined methods such as those currently used by advocates for the revival of Chinese colour woodcut techniques, folk art woodcuts representative of practices from Tantau village in southwest Hunan, as well as the reconciliation of analogue and digital printmaking in hybrid processes. This research was consolidated in preparations for *The Xiaoxiang Exhibition of International Printmaking* \[3.7\], which created international contexts for Chinese printmaking by showcasing over 200 prints by 90 artists from Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Ireland, the UK and USA, and drew attention to a hitherto unrecognised international community of printmakers. 

 Both Croft’s practice\-based and curatorial research demonstrates how innovation, ingenuity, historical knowledge, craft, entrepreneurship, networking and collaboration drive contemporary practice and regenerate the discourse on printmaking worldwide.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Through practice\-as\-research, solo and curated exhibitions, print portfolios, exhibitions and masterclasses, Croft has enabled a more nuanced understanding of contemporary print practice. More specifically, his research has: 

-  Generated new opportunities that expanded professional and creative practices for a range of beneficiaries \(artists, collectors, students and the general public\) 

-  Enriched public appreciation for and understanding of printmaking as a key form of artistic expression 

 As an active printmaker, Croft has exhibited his prints in solo and group shows both nationally and internationally, and has devised and contributed to major print portfolios. In so doing, he has provided new opportunities for public audiences to experience contemporary printmaking. His projects have enabled UK printmakers to exhibit internationally. He has also helped artists from Changsha – a city far from China’s cosmopolitan centres, that are integrated into the global art world and targeted by businesses and cultural institutions in the West – to promote the establishment of international networks and implement regional workshops. 

 *The Xiaoxiang Exhibition of International Printmaking* \(2015\) was seen as ‘an extraordinarily important event’ and recognised in China as ‘the most ambitious, largest exhibition ever’ to have been hosted in Hunan Province and ‘of the highest international standard seen outside Beijing’. It was greeted as a ‘milestone of great significance … in the history of Hunan printmaking’ and credited with playing ‘an important role in expanding the academic influence of fine art at Changsha Normal’. Cooperation with Aberystwyth University was deemed to have established a ‘good foundation for the Xiaoxiang International Centre for Printmaking and the continuing development of international academic exchanges’ at Changsha \[5.1\]. That the project was deemed by Chinese officials to be of cultural significance is evidenced by the funding awarded by government agencies including the China Artists Association and the China Printmaking Society. 

 Touring the UK \(2015–2016\), *Contemporary Chinese Printmaking* offered international audiences a context for contemporary practice in China. For many of the artists involved, it constituted the first opportunity to exhibit outside China. Four of them visited the UK in 2014. Stroud’s exhibition officer noted that many visitors ‘appreciated being able to see work from China at their ‘local’ museum and art gallery’. They hoped there could be ‘more exhibitions like this’ in ‘regional museums and galleries’ \[5.2\]. Clotworthy House gallerygoers in Antrim judged the ‘masterful work’ to be ‘awe\-inspiring’ and ‘world class\! What an eye\-opener\!’ \[5.3\]. 

  

 As the principal source of reference for practitioners in Australia, China, the UK and USA, Croft’s publications also help expand the reach of his creative and professional practice. The Chinese edition of Croft’s book *Stone Lithography*, gives lithographers in China access to Western approaches, as evidenced by a well\-thumbed, annotated copy at Guanlan International Printmaking Base, Shenzhen \[5.4\]. 

 A Master\-Printer at the world\-renowned Curwen Studio noted that he frequently referred to Croft’s research ‘when testing out \[Croft’s\] waterless technique’, while another at the Atelier Le Grand near Limoges found Croft’s instructions ‘clear and concise’ and ‘easy’ to follow. An Australian printmaker found the books ‘\[e\]specially useful when setting up shop’; another practitioner noted he had used Croft’s books throughout ‘20\+ years of teaching’; and a well\-known Bristol\-based artist stated that Croft’s ‘litho bible’ is ‘always by our press’ \[5.5\]. 

 In Wales, Croft fostered awareness of printmaking in his capacity as founder member of the Print Council of Wales, and Chair of the regional cooperative Aberystwyth Printmakers, for whom he equipped a print workshop and developed touring exhibitions, publishing projects, masterclasses, and a community education programme. He connects members of the cooperative with the renowned practitioners who visit, to make prints under his supervision: Anne Desmet RA, Shani Rhys James MBE, Mary Lloyd Jones, Wuon Gean Ho, Marcelle Hanselaar John Duffin RE, and Stuart Pearson Wright. 

 Desmet stated that her collaboration with Croft had been ‘stimulating’ and had enabled her to ‘think creatively in a different manner’. Hanselaar found working with him to be ‘one of the most instructive and successful’ collaborations and an ‘invaluable help in developing \[her\] imagery’. Wuon\-Gean Ho appreciated being guided through a ‘complicated printing technique that artists cannot easily do alone’, and Duffin pointed out the ‘clear and tangible benefits’ to his ‘practice and teaching’ \[5.6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by the University of Oxford has changed the way that men with prostate cancer are diagnosed are treated. Two large, linked, multi\-centre randomised clinical trials assessed the effectiveness of screening and treatment for prostate cancer. These studies demonstrated that a prostate cancer screening programme using a single PSA \(prostate\-specific antigen\) blood test offers no survival benefits, but causes over\-detection of indolent cancers and potential harm due to over\-treatment. 

 The combined outcomes of the ProtecT \(<ins> **Pro**</ins>state <ins> **te**</ins>sting for **c**ancer and <ins> **T**</ins>reatment\) and CAP \(<ins> **C**</ins>lustered r<ins> **A**</ins>ndomised trial of PSA testing for <ins> **P**</ins>rostate Cancer\) trials have led to major changes in policy and guidelines globally, including NICE, US and European guidelines all recommending more active monitoring to reduce harmful non\-beneficial interventions. As a result of these studies, and changes to the guidelines, men are able to make informed choices about whether to undertake PSA testing in the first place, to understand the potential significant harms and assess the risk/benefit of treatment. This has, for example, resulted in over\-treatment falling from 12% in 2016 to 4% in 2018 in the UK. 

 The research has also provided evidence necessary to prevent the implementation of a non\-beneficial PSA screening programme, which in the UK has avoided 10,000,000 more PSA tests and 1,400,000 biopsies, delivered an estimated cost saving to the NHS of GBP1,000,000,000 per year and prevented the resulting physical and mental harms to men. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The ProtecT trial is a large\-scale, collaborative RCT, spanning twenty years, beginning in 1999 as a feasibility study; the main trial started in 2002 and will end March 2022, to enable extended 15\-year follow\-up. The trial was designed to test the treatment effectiveness and cost effectiveness of active monitoring, surgery or radiotherapy in clinically localised prostate cancer detected through screening, with a primary endpoint of prostate cancer specific mortality at 10 years. Hamdy led the trial as Chief Principal Investigator \(University of Sheffield until 2008, then University of Oxford from 2008 \- present\), together with Co\-Principal Investigators J Donovan \(University of Bristol\) and D Neal \(University of Cambridge, then University of Oxford from 2015 \- 2019\). 

 Hamdy moved to the University of Oxford in October 2008, bringing the role of Chief Principal Investigator with him to Oxford; the underpinning research for the impact claimed began at this point and focuses on the follow\-up phase of the study. The full RCT completed recruitment in January 2009, with 111,000 men recruited, and 82,429 tested. The 10\-year median follow\-up milestone was reached in November 2015, when the data were unblinded. During the subsequent 6 month period the statistical analysis was conducted in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Bristol, and interpretation of the results and determination of findings was led by Hamdy at Oxford. This research led to two papers describing primary and secondary endpoints \[1, 2\]. The research showed that cancer deaths occurred at very low rates \(approximately 1%\), irrespective of the treatment allocated; all\-cause mortality was also low at approximately 10% with no differences between the arms; radical treatments reduced disease progression and metastases by approximately 50% compared with active monitoring; and surgery and radiotherapy were equivalent in oncological outcomes, but had different side\-effect profiles \[1, 2\]. 

 Further statistical analysis demonstrated that although surgery and radical treatment reduced metastasis and progression compared with active monitoring \(AM\), there were negative impacts on sexual, urinary, and bowel functioning. In addition, radical treatments may be associated with lower prostate cancer mortality than AM, although the numbers of such deaths were low irrespective of treatment. More than 95 out of every 100 men with low or intermediate risk localised prostate cancer do not die of prostate cancer within 10 years, irrespective of whether treatment is by means of monitoring, surgery, or radiotherapy. The research showed that there was a trade\-off between the side effects on sexual function and urinary continence, which are better after active monitoring, against the risks of spreading of prostate cancer \[3\]. 

 The cohort study of men undergoing prostate biopsy in the ProtecT study showed that 1.3% required hospital admission and 10.4% consultation with a doctor because of post\-biopsy symptoms including pain, fever, and blood in urine, faeces and ejaculate \[4\]. 

 In the ProtecT study, GP practices from 9 UK centres were randomised to either the ProtecT intervention \(which consisted of an invitation to PSA testing in men aged 50 \- 69 years\) or routine NHS practice \(where PSA testing is very low in the UK\). This created a natural control arm with the practices which were not randomised to ProtecT. This allowed ProtecT to become the intervention arm of the CAP study of prostate cancer screening, with Hamdy as a joint PI, the largest randomised controlled trial of screening for prostate cancer worldwide, using a single PSA test, with 415,357 participants. After a median follow up of 10 years, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the group of men invited to screening and the control group, but an increase in the number of low\-risk prostate cancers detected. The research also showed that in addition to the 2,965 men diagnosed through ProtecT, the diagnostic pathway missed the diagnosis of 1,433 cases, of whom 188 men died of prostate cancer. This confirmed that the worldwide conventional diagnostic pathway of PSA testing followed by biopsies was inadequate and missed too many lethal cancers \[5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Screening and management of PSA\-detected prostate cancer has been a controversial healthcare topic globally.  Cancer Research UK estimates that there are approximately 48,500 new cases of prostate cancer each year in the UK, and the American Cancer Society estimates that there are approximately 191,930 new cases each year in the US. 

 Opportunistic PSA testing in asymptomatic men has led to early detection and drives subsequent radical treatments that were intended to improve quantity and quality of life of these men, but are associated with a risk of significant adverse side\-effects. Prior to the initiation of the ProtecT trial, studies in the UK \(British Association of Urological Surgeons\) and US \(Department of Veterans Affairs\) showed that over 90% of men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer received radical treatment, mostly in the form of radical prostatectomy. 

 The Oxford research \[1 – 5\] provided a powerful evidence base for the effectiveness of screening and treatments, highlighting how the harms of screening and treatment can outweigh the benefits. This has informed practice changes globally, reflected in global NICE, US and European guidelines recommending more active monitoring to reduce harmful non\-beneficial interventions allowing clinicians and individuals to benefit by making better decisions about care. 

####  Changes to global clinical guidance and policy 

 The NICE guideline on Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management published in May 2019 \[Ai\] describes and references the ProtecT trial in detail and appends a presentation given by Hamdy and Donovan \(Oct 2018\), which cites \[1, 2 and 5\] to the evidence considered by NICE \[Aii\]. The research informed the NICE guidelines as follows: 

-  Citing \[2\], NICE recommends active surveillance be offered as an option to people with low\-risk localised prostate cancer: “ *Based on the evidence from the ProtecT trial \(Donovan et al., 2016\), the choice of active surveillance, prostatectomy or radiotherapy appears to be a trade\-off between the benefits offered by prostatectomy and radiotherapy against their potential risk of side effects…….. Based on this evidence, the committee decided that all three treatment options may be suitable for different people and therefore agreed to keep the existing recommendation to offer active surveillance as an option to people with low\-risk localised prostate cancer*” \[Aii\] 

-  Based on \[2\], NICE kept the recommendation that the progression to radical treatment should be based on the man’s personal preferences. Side\-effect profiles extracted from and referring to ProtecT analysis are listed in the guidance \[Ai\]. 

 The US Preventive Services Task Force changed its policy for prostate cancer screening from a D \(“Discourage the use of this service”\) recommendation in 2011, to a C recommendation \(“Offer or provide this service for selected patients depending on individual Circumstances”\) in 2018 for men aged 55 \- 69 years, largely based on outcomes from the ProtecT and CAP trials. The cited Oxford research that showed no significant improvement in all\-cause or prostate cancer mortality in any of the treatment groups \[1, 5\] and the analysis of surgery and radical treatment vs. active monitoring \[3\] is cited in the policy. The “ *change in recommendation grade further reflects new evidence about and increased use of active surveillance of low\-risk prostate cancer, which may reduce the risk  of subsequent harms from screening*.”  The guidelines go on to elaborate that “ *the decision to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individual one*” and “ *before deciding whether to be screened, men aged 55 to 69 years should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision*”. \[B\] 

 The European Association of Urology prostate cancer guidelines published in 2019, refer to the ProtecT Study research \[1\] on describing Active Surveillance \(AS\) / Active Monitoring \(AM\)  thus:  “ *…, the ProtecT study has reinforced the role of deferred active treatment \(i.e. either AS or some form of initial AM\) as a feasible alternative to active curative interventions for patients with low\-grade and low\-stage disease*” and that *“AS should be the default management strategy in patients with low\-risk disease and a life expectancy > 10 years”* \[C\]. 

####  Financial savings to healthcare providers 

 The NHS and other healthcare providers have benefitted from costs and resources avoided by not implementing a regular PSA test\-based screening platform. A UK options appraisal \[D\] found that annual screening would result in almost 10,000,000 more PSA tests per year and 1,400,000 biopsies and, therefore, a large increase in many resources would be required \(e.g. GP nurse sessions, PSA tests, radical treatments, hormone treatment, outpatient appointments\). Total additional lifetime costs for a cohort of men aged 50 of a screen\-once policy at 50 were estimated as GBP50,000,000, rising to almost GBP1,000,000,000 for an annual screening policy in the UK \[D\]. The clinical costs of screening in the UK, without administrative costs, were estimated to be GBP600,000,000 to GBP1,700,000,000 per year \[E\]. 

 In November 2020, the UK National Screening Committee \(UK NSC\) completed its first periodic review since 2016 and concluded that a screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK was not recommended, for reasons including the harms caused and no single better treatment for early\-stage disease \[H\].  The evidence document included numerical data from the ProtecT trial and cited \[1\] and \[2\] as part of the 2019 NICE review for NG131 \[A\]. 

####  Health benefits to patients 

 The high\-quality evidence from ProtecT enables men to make properly\-informed choices about testing and, for those with clinically localised prostate cancer, to decide on the balance between the benefits and side\-effect profiles of radical treatments. 

 The cohort study of men undergoing prostate biopsy in the ProtecT study showed that 1.3% required hospital admission and 10.4% consultation with a doctor because of post\-biopsy adverse symptoms including pain, fever, and blood in urine, faeces and ejaculate \[4\]. Among the two\-thirds of men who received a negative or inconclusive biopsy result as part of ProtecT, around 20% reported high distress persisting up to 12 weeks \[F\]. By contributing to the evidence base used by policy makers to decide not to put screening in place, the Oxford research has helped avoid 1,400,000 biopsies per year \[D\] and subsequent harms avoided e.g. an estimated 18,200 men requiring hospital admission, 145,600 men suffering post\-biopsy adverse symptoms and 184,800 men suffering high distress, per year. 

 The National Prostate Cancer Audit \(NPCA\) assesses the quality of services in England and Wales, and aimed to reduce over\-treatment of men with low\-risk prostate cancer, by auditing the percentage of men with low\-risk prostate cancer receiving radical treatment. In 2016, the rate of over\-treatment was 12%, and NPCA authors cited \[1\] and commented: *“the proportion of men with low\-risk disease being potentially ‘over\-treated’ is an area of concern, especially given the recent publication of the ProtecT study”* \[Gi\]. In the 2 years after the publication of the main ProtecT study clinical outcomes, over\-treatment reduced by two\-thirds \(from 12% to 8% in 2017 \[Gii\], and to 4% in 2018 \[Giii\]\). In 2017, the NPCA noted that *“the trend seen towards a reduction in men with low\-risk disease being “potentially over\-treated” is encouraging”* and suggested that the results of studies such as \[1\] were being disseminated into national practice \[Gii\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Multiple members of UCL’s Centre for Law and Environment \( **CLE**\) shaped generational transformation in UK environmental law through direct engagement with NGOs, Parliament and government. In particular, research by CLE scholars: 

-  Demonstrated the need for legislation to address impending gaps in UK environmental law and governance post\-Brexit, convincing government to commit to sector\-specific legislation in the EU Withdrawal Act 2018 and shaping the draft Bill that followed; 

-  Strengthened the important role played by environmental principles in ensuring a high standard of environmental protection in the UK for the post\-Brexit era; 

-  Successfully made the case for, and influenced design of, a brand\-new regulatory body for England – the Office for Environmental Protection – and led preparations for an interim regulatory body during the Brexit transition; and 

-  Directly informed ambitious new policy on air quality law, leading to new legislative proposals on air quality governance in England. 

 This work has helped safeguard and develop the UK’s environmental law for the future, to the benefit of nature itself \(respecting its intrinsic value\), and human health and wellbeing.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Researchers in UCL’s Centre for Law and Environment have been at the forefront of **systematic study of UK environmental law for over two decades, shedding particular light on the complex, far\-reaching influence of EU law on environmental protection in Britain.** As Brexit approached, this breadth and depth of expertise allowed Centre researchers to analyse the **gaps that the loss of the EU environmental law framework would create in UK environmental law—as well as opportunities for innovation**. 

 **Accountability and enforcement:  A body of work by **Lee** \(including *EU Environmental Law, Governance and Decision\-Making* \(2<sup>nd</sup> ed, Hart 2014\)\) showed how EU law and institutional arrangements have come to underpin legitimate and accountable decision\-making in environmental matters. Research by **Macrory \(R1\)** developed criteria for good environmental enforcement and optimal sanctioning mechanisms. Building on this scholarship, **Lee** **\(R2\)** and **Macrory** **\(R3\)** highlighted the risk for environmental law, and environmental protection, of the loss of the EU’s governance and enforcement architecture, including the European Commission’s ability to bring Member States before the Court of Justice of the European Union \(with large fines for non\-compliance\), and EU law supporting domestic judicial review and national NGOs. **Lee’s** research **\(R2\)** broadened the governance focus to the loss of EU accountability measures, such as Member State planning and reporting obligations and associated review and reflection on ways of improving environmental protection. 

 **Role of environmental principles:  Comparative research by **Scotford \(R4\)** on environmental principles \(e.g. the precautionary and ‘polluter pays’ principles\), showed how EU ‘constitutionalisation’ of these principles \(in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\) had deeply entrenched an ambitious vision for environmental law and policy in EU law, and thus previously in UK law. Brexit raised major questions about how to retain these environmental principles within a British political culture that is reluctant to embed policy goals in legislative form. **Macrory** and Thornton \(QC, now High Court Judge\) **\(R5\)** suggested that the most promising approach would be to set out principles in policy documents, and then link these to decision\-making through legislation. After the government released a draft Environment \(Principles and Governance\) Bill \(Dec 2018\), purporting to ‘retain’ EU environmental principles in English law, **Lee** and **Scotford** showed **\(R6\)** that there were significant weaknesses in what the Bill purported to do in relation to principles. 

 **Opportunities to improve air quality:** An overhaul of environmental legislation also offered opportunities extending beyond replacing EU law mechanisms. **Scotford’s** analysis of air quality law **\(R7\)** highlighted limitations of pre\-Brexit UK law, which should be addressed, particularly reliance on local authorities to address air pollution problems often beyond their competence and control. Scotford argued that future English air quality law needed a more ambitious governance architecture allocating responsibility and coordinating administrative effort across the full reach of government, rather than concentrated in local authorities alone.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 UCL CLE research demonstrated that a simple ‘roll\-over’ of EU legislation on Brexit would have meant the loss of key governance and enforcement mechanisms, from frameworks for planning, monitoring and reporting, to the threat of European Commission action against the UK in the CJEU \(the Commission having brought 12–20 environmental infringements against the UK annually 2015–19\). Loss of these mechanisms posed a major risk to UK environmental law and protection post\-Brexit, particularly in areas where EU enforcement action had been critical to progress \(e.g. air quality, wastewater infrastructure, and environmental impact assessment processes\). UCL CLE scholars had significant impact in addressing this risk: 

-  through individual and direct advice to government and evidence to Parliament; and 

-  as primary legal academic voices strengthening campaigns of NGOs shaping political debate \( **Lee** as member of Brexit Scenarios Group, **Greener UK** \(a coalition of 12 of the UK’s most prominent environmental NGOs, combined public membership >8m\); Macrory and Scotford as chair and member, respectively, of UK Environmental Law Association \( **UKELA**\) Brexit Task Force \( **BTF**\)\). 

 **\(i\) Demonstrating need for legislation addressing environmental ‘governance gap’** 

 In October 2016, Lee and Macrory gave oral evidence before the House of Lords EU Committee investigating Brexit’s implications for environmental law. While initial focus was on the ‘roll\-over’ of EU environmental law into UK law, Lee and Macrory raised wider questions of the loss of EU governance mechanisms \(such as planning, monitoring and reporting\), and the need for enforcement arrangements to replace the European Commission **\(R2, R3\)**. They were cited extensively in the Committee’s report, underpinning a recommendation to establish a new national independent body to fulfil this role **\(S1\)**. 

 Lee and Macrory maintained pressure for an independent body and improved post\-Brexit environmental governance, both in their individual academic capacities and through work within highly influential NGOs. Two leading members of the Greener UK alliance have stated that Lee was a ‘ *consistent and influential voice*’ empowering the Greener UK Brexit Scenarios Group, which was a ‘ *core intellectual driver of the coalition’s analysis, advocacy and lobbying*’, to engage with governance issues. Her work **\(R2\)** informed inter alia a Greener UK policymakers brief on *The Governance Gap: Why Brexit would Weaken Environmental Protections* \(Aug 2017\) which, along with other lobbying activities shaped by Lee, ‘ *played an important role in influencing parliamentarians … on governance*’ **\(S2\)**. 

 The central role of Greener UK \(informed by Lee\) in pressing for new legislation on governance and principles is evident in an account given in Parliament by Zac Goldsmith MP \(as he then was\) of ‘ *discussions between Government Members, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State’s advisers and the Greener UK representatives* \[which\] *were meaningful… \[and\] led to a broad agreement on a solution*’, namely ‘ *creating a strong, independent body with teeth that can hold the Government and their successor Governments to account on the environment, \[and\] a policy statement … that will set out … those key environmental principles.*’ **\(S3\)**. 

 Within government, a July 2017 UKELA report on *Enforceability and Political Accountability post Brexit* \( **UKELA Report**\), for which Macrory and his work **\(R3\)** were largely responsible, was an ‘ *important point of reference*’ as ‘ *the Government shifted its stance \[on what was required\] to compensate for the loss of EU governance structures*’, and a ‘ *driving force*’ in setting up the Government’s work on a new Bill, according to a lead DEFRA official at the time **\(S4\).** In May 2018, DEFRA released a consultation paper committing to publishing a new draft Environmental Principles and Governance Bill on these issues in autumn 2018, with the UKELA report cited as the authority for the proposition that, while Brexit would entail loss of EU frameworks in many areas, there was a ‘ *special case to act on the environment*’ **\(S5\)**. 

 Following Lords amendments, s 16 of the European Union \(Withdrawal\) Act 2018 \( **EUWA**\) introduced the only sector\-specific commitment in the EUWA on legal issues caused by Brexit. It required a new Bill to be introduced within 6 months, establishing a body for enforcing environmental law; and publication of a policy statement on nominated environmental principles to which Ministers must have regard in setting policy \(the latter according with Macrory and Thornton’s suggestion on retaining environmental principles **\(R5\)**\). 

 The Government then published a draft Environment \(Principles and Governance\) Bill 2018 \(England\) \( **draft E\(PG\) Bill**\) which followed the EUWA requirements but also constructed a notion of government accountability for environmental protection going beyond formal enforcement, to include requirements for monitoring and reporting. As members of the Greener UK alliance have stated, Lee’s work **\(R2, S1\)** had a ‘ *real impact*’ on these governance aspects of the Bill **\(S2\)**. 

 **\(ii\) Strengthening role of environmental principles in post\-Brexit legislation** 

 UCL researchers played prominent roles in scrutiny of the draft E\(PG\) Bill, leading to notable changes in the succeeding, and more comprehensive, UK/English Environment Bill 2019–20 \( **Environment Bill**\), particularly on environmental principles. \(At 31 Dec 2020, the Environment Bill was due for report stage and third reading in 2021, having been delayed by the disrupted Parliamentary timetable. The Bill has been carried over to the 2021 Autumn Parliamentary session, when Royal Assent is expected\). 

 Drawing on **R2**, **R5**, and **R6**, Lee, Macrory and Scotford gave oral evidence to the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \( **EFRA**\) Committee and to the Environmental Audit Committee \( **EAC**\) on treatment of principles in the draft E\(PG\) Bill 2018. The Committees’ reports picked up their criticisms of, inter alia: the weakness of the requirement that Ministers ‘have regard to’ a policy statement on principles; wide exceptions to this requirement; and relegation to the status of principles of what were legal rights under the Aarhus Convention. On each of these points, there were committee recommendations, and the Bill was amended **\(S6\)**. The lead DEFRA official recalls that work of UCL CLE researchers, including **R6**, was helpful in developing the legislative approach on principles and ‘ *especially important in influencing* \[colleagues\] *to remove some of the principles which they had* \[drawn\] *in from the Aarhus Convention*’ \(and which, Professor Scotford explained, ‘ *might effectively be downgraded*’ by this drafting\) **\(S4\)** *.* 

 As concerns remained about the comprehensiveness of the Bill as it evolved **,** Scotford led a group of UK academics and practitioners in a public letter in the *Telegraph* \(30 Oct 2019\), challenging government claims that non\-regression had been secured. This elicited a response from the Minister that the Government had no intention of weakening environmental protection **\(S7\)**. 

 In Scotland, Scotford’s oral evidence to Holyrood’s Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee on the Scottish Continuity Bill \(Aug 2020\), drawing on **R4** and **R6**, was the main academic input on environmental principles, and informed Committee recommendations that led to two key amendments in the final Act \(passed all Bill stages Dec 2020\): requiring Ministers and public bodies to have ‘due’ regard to environmental principles, and inserting the ‘integration principle’ as a ‘guiding principle on the environment’ **\(S8\)**. 

 **\(iii\) Influencing design of Office for Environmental Protection and interim body** 

 Lee and Macrory influenced the design of the new enforcement body, especially between publication of the draft E\(PG\) Bill \(Dec 2018\) and the subsequent Environment Bill \(Oct 2019\). In January 2019, Lee published a detailed analysis of the proposed Office for Environmental Protection \(OEP\) **\(S9\)**, shared with NGOs and government and parliamentary staff. Lee and Macrory gave oral evidence to the EFRA Committee in Jan–Feb 2019, including detailed discussion of the proposed OEP; Macrory was invited to give supplementary evidence to the EFRA Committee on recommendations to improve the powers of the OEP. 

 Evidence from Lee and Macrory was heavily cited in the EFRA committee report and linked EAC report. Proposals made by them \(and members of groups of which they were part\), drawing on specific suggestions in **R2, R3** and **S9**, appeared in the new version of the Environment Bill \(published Oct 2019\) and in a formal HM Treasury spending commitment, enhancing the body’s effectiveness. These amendments included: power of the OEP to intervene in environmental judicial reviews; power to seek to involve central government in enforcement action against other bodies; power for the OEP to undertake investigations without prior complaint; five\-year ring\-fenced budget for OEP; and duty on the Secretary of State to respect the OEP’s independence **\(S6\)**. Greener UK confirms Lee’s involvement in meetings with DEFRA officials on some of these topics ‘ *at a time when critical options were under consideration*’ **\(S2\)**, and a lead DEFRA official describes Macrory’s role as ‘ *a key source of insight on possible “bespoke” arrangements for … enforcement*’ **\(S4\)**. 

 The OEP’s existence was confirmed by Dec 2020, when DEFRA undertook to ensure pre\-appointment scrutiny of the OEP Chair. Drawing on a body of work in **R1**, Macrory ‘ *very significantly helped*’ DEFRA officials bring the OEP to life. He was appointed in 2019 to lead a transitional Interim Environment Governance Secretariat \( **IEGS**\), pending the OEP’s establishment. In this role \(2019–20\), he trained DEFRA civil servants in environmental law and complaints handling, ‘ *established the core basic principles for a public complaint system and developed vital foundations for the IEGS’ formal public launch*’ \(on 1 Jan 2021\) **\(S4\)**. 

 **\(iv\) Directly informing new legislative proposals on air quality governance in England** 

 The damaging effects of air pollution have made air quality a key public concern, particularly with the coronial finding that the death of 9\-year\-old Ella Kissi\-Debrah was connected to unlawful levels of air pollution. Scotford’s research **\(R7\)** developed concrete recommendations, including imposing air quality obligations on public bodies beyond local authorities, and improving coordination between these bodies. Scotford presented her recommendations to central and local government stakeholders \(Dec 2018\); the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Air Pollution \(Mar 2019\); and at a key private meeting with DEFRA officials \(April 2019\). Considerations raised by Scotford’s research ‘ *directly led*’ to amendments in the Environment Bill, Sch 11, according to DEFRA’s senior Air Quality Lead for Environment Act amendments **\(S10\)**. By fostering more dispersed and better coordinated legal responsibility for air quality, these amendments improve prospects of controlling air pollution and protecting human health. 

 **Overall**, the Director of Legal Services, Environment Agency \(England\) testifies that ‘ *government policy deliberations* \[on post\-Brexit environmental law\] *have been directly influenced by the research*’ of Lee, Macrory and Scotford, this being ‘ *repeatedly evident in public and private meetings … with policy officers and special advisers*’, and bringing ‘ *an analytical rigour … which collectively became a persuasive force that NGOs alone had neither the capacity, nor capability, nor independent standing to assert*’ **\(S11\)**. UCL CLE researchers intervened with lasting effect on the architecture and core aspects of post\-Brexit environmental law, laying foundations for a generational transformation in Britain’s environmental protection.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The **Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project \(2015\-2019\)**, led by the University of Southampton’s Centre for Maritime Archaeology \( **CMA**\), was a major international collaborative survey of the Bulgarian waters of the Black Sea. The unique discoveries, including ancient shipwrecks, were widely communicated throughout the Project, capturing the fascination of millions globally through the front pages of major international newspapers, an interactive roadshow, US and UK documentaries produced by a dedicated film crew, and ongoing exhibitions. Offering a model for integrated maritime research and impact, the Project championed international best practice as defined by UNESCO and shaped policy on cultural heritage management in the Black Sea region and beyond. In the UK, it delivered a highly successful embedded STEM Scholar programme providing opportunity to A\-level students from challenging school environments. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Operational since 1995, the CMA is the hub for global research on early seafaring, maritime infrastructure, maritime landscapes and palaeo\-landscapes; and work on methodology, heritage value and ethics within maritime archaeology. Expertise on ship technology and underwater archaeology is represented by the work of Adams, Whitewright and Blue; maritime heritage and capacity building \(notably in Egypt, the Arab world, and the eastern Mediterranean\) by the work of Blue \[ **3.1**\]; while Sturt, Farr and Bynoe lead major projects on submerged palaeo\-landscapes and prehistoric maritime migration. Along with Professor Justin Dix and Dr Michael Grant \(based in the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton\), Sturt directs Coastal and Offshore Archaeological Research Services \(COARS\), an enterprise unit that has provided specialist heritage support to key infrastructure projects \(including Hinkley Point, Sizewell, High Speed 2 and London Array\). 

 The extensive, large\-scale datasets these projects provide have facilitated innovative methodological and analytical procedures that carry over directly into frontline CMA Research. This experience, depth of expertise and proven research excellence in maritime archaeology was instrumental in the design and implementation of the **Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project,** the largest and most ambitious project of its kind ever undertaken. The five\-year Project \(2015\-2019\) was funded by the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust through the Expedition and Education Foundation, with a total value of GBP15m. It represented a collaboration between researchers from the CMA: Adams \(Scientific Lead\), Dix, Farr, Grant, Pacheco\-Ruiz, Sturt, Whitewright and doctoral researcher Pedrotti; the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, National Institute of Archaeology with Museum \(Vagalinski\) and the Bulgarian Centre for Underwater Archaeology \(Angelova, Dimitrov\); along with the Maritime Archaeological Research Institute at Södertörn University \(Sweden\) \(Rönnby\), the University of Connecticut \(USA\) \(Batchvarov\), the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research \(Greece\) \(Sakellariou\) and Swedish industrial partners MMT \(Oskarsson, Holmlund\). 

 The Project integrated long\-standing research strengths of the CMA in palaeo\-landscapes, environmental change and ancient seafaring. Utilising state\-of\-the\-art remote sensing, geophysical and geotechnical survey techniques, its primary focus was to establish the chronology and processes of environmental change in the Black Sea region since the last glacial maximum in order to understand their impacts on human populations. The research design, including systems specification, was written by the CMA \(Adams, Dix\) with Bulgaria’s Centre for Underwater Archaeology \(Angelova\). CMA directed each phase of the deep water and coastal fieldwork, processed geophysical data and managed an exhaustive programme of core sample analysis. In total, an area of over 2000km<sup>2</sup> was surveyed, with 6000 line km of geophysical data acquired, along with 92 cores recovered from 78 locations. The results have enabled the construction of a new robust chronology for events relating to the exposure and subsequent inundation of the palaeo\-landscape on the Bulgarian shelf, supported by underwater excavation of inundated prehistoric coastal settlement sites \[ **3.2**; **3.3**; **3.4**; **3.5**\]. 

 During the Project, 65 ancient and historical shipwrecks were discovered, many unique within the archaeological record, preserved in the Black Sea’s anoxic waters. They include the best\-preserved wrecks of Ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods currently known, offering unparalleled insight into early vessel technology, seafaring and maritime affairs. High resolution 3D acoustic and optical surveys of these sites were made using two robotic systems sequentially: the unique high\-speed ‘Surveyor Interceptor’, a Survey Remotely Operated Vehicle \(SROV\), designed by MMT, acquired multibeam, sidescan and chirp sub\-bottom data as well as laser bathymetry and hi\-resolution still images. A work class ROV carrying ultra\-HD video and stills cameras then captured imagery for photogrammetric models. These systems recovered data at depths, acquisition rate and resolutions unparalleled in archaeological work to date \[ **3.6**\]. Together with the paleoenvironmental data this has enabled not only modelling of the changing land/seascape of the Black Sea but has significantly increased our understanding of how people engaged directly with it through seafaring over the millennia. 

 Together with the Science Team, the Project embedded Education and Documentary teams as integral, fully funded elements of the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project, and which contributed directly to the impact described below.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Engaging publics with Maritime Heritage** 

 The **Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project** **\(BSMAP, 2015\-2019\)** communicated its unique findings to publics throughout the research period with the aim of influencing public attitudes to submerged heritage and demonstrating that research of this nature can and should be entirely compliant with the UNESCO 2001 *Convention on the Protection of the Submerged Cultural Heritage*. 

 The shipwrecks especially captured media and public attention. The discovery of a well\-preserved ship from the time of Marco Polo, an intact Roman ship from the 1<sup>st</sup> Century AD, and the oldest intact shipwreck yet found – a 2,400\-year\-old Greek vessel – reached the pages of news outlets across the world, from the UK to China to New Zealand, and were reported in multiple languages. BSMAP generated the only story to push Donald Trump off the front page of the *New York Times* in November 2016. Written by double Pulitzer Prize winner William Broad, the online version received over 1 million hits in 24 hours, a record for an archaeological story \(Broad NYT 14/11/16\). In 2018 news of the discovery of the Greek ship was so widely read that satirists referenced it from the Daily Mash \(23/10/18\) to a Peter Brookes cartoon in the UK *Times* \(24/10/18\) lampooning the Brexit process, showing Teresa May \(as Odysseus\) lashed to the mast. \[ **5.1**\] 

 Reaching these publics helped to raise awareness of the unique, international heritage value of the anoxic Black Sea and of ancient trading relationships. As the National Geographic’s archaeologist in residence Fredrick Heibert put it, the discoveries highlighted that the Black Sea is “an incredibly rich museum of human history…This \[Greek\] wreck shows the unprecedented potential for preservation in the Black Sea, which has been a critical crossroads of world cultures for thousands of years.” \[ **5.2**\]. This find also caught the imagination of the archaeological press: it was voted the world’s most significant archaeological discovery of the year by the readership of a consortium of national archaeological magazines \[ **5.3**\]. The associated award, presented to Adams at Paestum, Italy in November 2019, is named for Khaled al\-Asaad and commemorates his life’s work protecting cultural heritage as the Director of Palmyra before he was murdered by Isis in 2015. 

 Public engagement was continued in 2018 after the final offshore season through a travelling exhibition which was designed to disseminate results to a wider public in tandem with the Project’s STEM\-related educational aims \(below\). The ‘Black Sea MAP Roadshow’ included virtual reality tours of key shipwrecks \(via headsets\), 3D\-printing of shipwrecks and a hands\-on exhibit relating to geological core sampling. The Roadshow was taken to seven venues in the UK during 2018, run and curated by doctoral research students \(Newman, Socha\). The exhibit was professionally built by Swim Productions with content generated by the Science Team. The combined footfall of these festivals was 11,608 visitors, 7,800 of them directly engaging with the Black Sea stall. The ‘Roadshow’ was then donated to the Muzeiko – *Children’s Science Museum* in Sofia, Bulgaria, which saw a footfall of 50,000 in the first 6 months. \[ **5.4**\] BSMAP’s Documentary Team *Black Sea Films* filmed the Project throughout 2015\-2018. They comprised film makers whose CVs included work on the series Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Underwater footage was captured with ultra\-HD cameras and resulted in two one\-hour documentaries premiered at the British Museum on 23 October 2018 coinciding with the first of two international conferences \(London, at the Wellcome collection, and Sofia at the National Museum\). They were subsequently aired in the USA on the *Discovery Channel* and in the UK on *More4* \(7 & 14 June 2019\). Viewing figures in USA were the second highest for an archaeology programme since 2010 \[ **5.5**\]. As well as capturing public interest, these films featured in policy and practice advocacy as outlined below. 

 As the data from the ancient shipwrecks was unprecedented, a follow\-on grant was awarded for reconstruction and analysis of hull form, including computational analysis and tank testing. An approach from the Science Museum led to them becoming a Project partner and they will include the results of analysis of the 400 BC Greek ship in a forthcoming exhibition on Science and Technology in the Ancient Greek World \(November 2021\) \[ **5.6**\]. 

 **Improving outcomes and increasing STEM knowledge of A\-Level Students** 

 The core of BSMAP’s Educational aims were centred on an embedded STEM Scholar Programme running continuously through 2015 – 2017, coordinated by Education specialists, *Catalyst*, with material and activities provided and delivered by the BSMAP Science Team. 32 students from challenging school environments were selected to join the programme to engage with Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths components of maritime archaeological research. Half worked on an onshore placement at the *National Oceanography Centre Southampton*, and half offshore on the research vessel itself. The onshore groups engaged in a series of activities taught/supervised by the Science Team related to the Project: acquisition and processing of geophysical data, core sample processing and shipwreck recording. Offshore groups participated in the same activities during the cruise. The Project encouraged subject engagement and promoted the opportunity to enter higher education, inspiring a new generation of young scientists, extending knowledge, and changing the way these young people view and engage with science and the marine environment. The students stated that the Project *“opened my eyes to what marine \[maritime\] archaeology is and the amount of work that goes on.” “It’s completely changed what I want to do” “I've had such a fantastic time and met so many wonderful people and learnt so many things\! I have a clearer idea of what I want to do\!”* \[ **5.7**\]. Most of the students had not originally planned to go to university or had doubted they would get in if they applied. 31 STEM Scholars gained their CREST Gold Award, a national scheme for student\-led project work in the STEM subjects from the British Science Association, which is academically recognised and translates into other academic areas \(e.g., Extended Project Qualification and Welsh Baccalaureate\). This helped scholars with their university applications: *“MAP helped me get into university \- without it, I don’t think I’d get in” “Don’t think I’d be where I am today without the experience.”* \[ **5.7**\]. Currently 22 are now in Higher Education with three more completing their A\-levels or taking Gap Years with a view to HE. These scholars also acted as STEM Ambassadors in their schools and community widening the visibility of the programme \(e.g., on CBBC Newsround\), demonstrating their new confidence and skills as science communicators. Feedback from the scholars emphasised not only the academic impact of their involvement in the programme but the other skills gained: *“It's been an amazing experience that I will appreciate and remember forever, and I think it'll contribute to my future greatly.”* \[ **5.6**\] 

 To broaden this STEM Scholarship programme to a wider audience, an educational portal was developed with work packages, lessons, STEM Careers advice, and educational films for use by schools \(Farr, Grant\). This was launched with educational posters that were sent to 5,500 secondary schools and 22,360 primary schools across England and Wales, and emails with the weblinks sent to the same schools in July 2019. From her involvement with this educational project Farr has been named as a STEM Champion by The Curiosity Box, an award\-winning UK company specialising in STEM\-related educational toys. Farr donated her time to develop a diving and underwater science themed box, ‘Under Pressure,’ for home subscription and for schools with the aim of reaching 1 million children with STEM. During the Covid\-19 pandemic, boxes are being sent free to children receiving free school meals who are being home\-schooled \[ **5.8**\]. 

 **Black Sea Maritime Heritage: Awareness and Policy** 

 A key legacy of Black Sea MAP is an increased awareness of maritime heritage in both central and regional Bulgarian administrations. In 2016, the Bulgarian *National Archaeological Institute with Museum* judged Black Sea MAP the most significant archaeological project that year. The Bulgarian Government recognised the Project’s significant contribution to the understanding and protection of underwater cultural heritage when in 2017, the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Boyko Borisov, spent time aboard the research vessel during the survey and subsequently bestowed special awards on team members. Adams, as Chief Scientist, was awarded the national honour of the Golden Century \[ **5.9**\]. 

 This high\-profile Project, and the resources BSMAP brought to bear, directly assisted the development of Bulgaria’s Centre for Underwater Archaeology \(CUA\), which now, with increased staffing and equipment, is the most capable and best resourced in the region. Follow\-on funding continues capacity\-building in the form of two PhD studentships for CUA staff, now at Southampton. Increased awareness of the nature and cultural value of their submerged heritage as demonstrated by BSMAP’s discoveries means Bulgarian authorities now exercise more direct monitoring of companies holding hydrocarbon prospection licences such as Total and Royal Dutch Shell, who are now encouraged to liaise with heritage agencies, particularly the CUA \[ **5.10**\]. 

 The MAP’s success in Bulgaria has also been recognised as a demonstration of best practice with the potential to influence policy and practice more widely. As stated above, the Project Research Design was written \(in concordance with the CMA Southampton’s Ethical Statement\), to explicitly foreground the UNESCO 2001 *Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.* The added value of the Project in meeting and indeed exceeding the standards set out as ‘Rules’ in the Annex to the Convention, was its demonstration to relevant Government Ministries and heritage managers worldwide that deep water archaeological sites should no longer be accessible to commercial exploitation and treasure hunting \[ **5.11**\]. 

 The Director of UNESCO stated: “I wish to also laud the CMA for the excellence in its research, teaching and capacity building world\-wide, with which it frequently supported UNESCO. This was recently evidenced within the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project \(BSMAP\). Its re\-search design emphasized compliance with the UNESCO 2001 Convention with the express intention to highlight how cutting\-edge archaeological research can be conducted in deep water, achieving ethical and valuable scientific aims. CMA thus demonstrated to heritage\-related Ministries and Agencies that large\-scale deep\-water archaeology is not the preserve of commercial salvors and treasure hunters but should be the sphere of appropriate scientific research. The presentation of a film on the Project at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris in presence of heritage professionals from all over the world was thus a powerful and much noticed testimony to the importance of UNESCO's and the 2001 Convention's objectives.” \[ **5.12**\] 

 To project this aspect of the Project as well as its results, UNESCO, at the 32nd Meeting of the States Parties to the 2001 Convention, screened the second Black Sea MAP documentary to delegates on 20th June 2019 at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris with the Director General of UNESCO and the Bulgarian Ambassador to France in attendance \[ **5.13**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Edinburgh Napier into different structures for renumeration and governance, in both private enterprise and public bodies, has influenced policy and legislation in Scotland. It helped a campaign group further their work towards a Scottish real living wage, resulting in an accreditation scheme that has led to an estimated GBP180million in additional wages for workers in Scotland. The research influenced the Scottish Government to introduce targets and quotas for gender representation on boards for public bodies and to make a public commitment, backed by financial support, to increase employee\-owned businesses in Scotland. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Dutton, Raeside, Egdell, McQuaid, and Canduela has looked at the impacts on organisations and employees of different structures for renumeration and governance – covering welfare to work schemes, in\-work poverty, the living wage, employee\-ownership and the constitution of boards. Their expertise in this field led to commissioned research from national and local government in Scotland and from business organisations and campaign groups. 

 **Living Wage** 

 In 2008, Dutton, McQuaid, Raeside and Canduela carried out research on behalf of the Poverty Alliance, a Scottish anti\-poverty campaign group, on a Living Wage for Scotland. The research **\[R1\]** developed a methodology to calculate a living wage based on three approaches: estimated basic living costs, income distribution, and actual expenditure by an average household. 

 **Employee ownership** 

 In 2012, the Employee Ownership Association **\[R2\],** sponsored by the John Lewis Partnership, commissioned research by McQuaid, Hollywood, Canduela, to examine the health and wellbeing among employees of employee\-owned businesses \(EOBs\). The researchers carried out interviews with 1000 staff in EOBs and compared the findings to the latest publicly available national Workplace Employee Relations Survey \(WERS\). They found that staff in EOBs reported higher levels of job satisfaction, more control over their work, more involvement in decision\-making and a more positive view of communications from management than their counterparts in non\-EOBs. Levels of health were higher among staff at EOBs than in the general population. 

 This work was followed by a report in 2013 for Scottish Enterprise looking at employee\-owned businesses in Scotland, in particular the main bottlenecks restricting growth of EOBs. This research **\[R3/ R4\]** by Dutton, Raeside, Canduela, Egdell and McQuaid compared the growth performance and growth dynamics of a selection of Scottish EOBs to a peer group of companies who have conventional ownership structures. They found that EOBs had significantly higher turnover, number of employees and return on capital and were equivalent in terms of profit margin and value to the Scottish economy to their non\-EOB peers. Most of the growth bottlenecks for EOBs were similar to those experienced by other businesses: e.g. difficulties recruiting skilled staff; skills gaps in the existing workforce; workforce capacity. However, the study also found that low levels of understanding of employee ownership among financial institutions acts as a barrier to economic growth and recommended steps to improve access to finance for EOBs. The two reports led to a 2019 paper in the British Journal of Industrial Relations **\[R6\].** 

 **Gender equality on boards** 

 In 2014, the Scottish government commissioned Dutton and Raeside to look at equality and diversity representation on public, private and third sector boards in Scotland **\[R5\]** to identify how barriers to equality can be overcome, particularly in relation to gender. The measures identified in the research included: increasing awareness through wider advertising, mentoring, improving professional networking and the option of quotas or targets.

 **Living wage** 

 Dutton, McQuaid, Raeside and Canduela’s research for the Poverty Alliance in 2008 contributed towards the organisation’s “ *thinking with respect to setting the level of the living wage in Scotland*” **\[IM1\].** The organisation continued to develop their campaign for a living wage, and this led to the launch of Living Wage Scotland in 2014, which is funded by the Scottish Government and accredits employers who pay the real Living Wage. To date more than 1,800 employers in Scotland have been accredited and an estimated GBP180m in additional wages has been won for workers in these organisations **\[IM1\].** 

 **Gender equality on boards** 

 This research, carried out on behalf of the Scottish Government and further promoted through the media, influenced the development of a new law on gender equality, with key recommendations from the report reflected in the legislation. 

 In September 2014, Dutton and Rae presented their report to the Scottish Government Public Boards and Corporate Diversity Programme Board, set up by the Scottish Government to investigate ways in which diversity on public boards could be improved. The research is cited in the minutes of the meeting **\[IM2\]** as providing an “ *evidence base for the programme”*. 

 The report’s findings were covered in the media in December 2014, including the Scottish Daily Mail and the Glasgow Herald **\[IM3\]**, in the context of voluntary gender equality targets for businesses set to be introduced by the Scottish Government. In July 2015, Dutton wrote an opinion article published in the Scotsman **\[IM4\]**, using evidence from the 2014 research to argue that the gender targets set by the Scottish Government were unlikely to be met by voluntary measures alone. 

 In 2017, the Scottish Government introduced the Gender Representation on Public Boards \(Scotland\) Bill \(SP Bill 16\) and the research was cited in written evidence on the Bill presented to the Scottish Parliaments Equalities and Human Rights Committee **\[IM5\]**. The Scottish Parliamentary briefing on the Bill \(September 2017\) repeatedly cites the 2014 Dutton and Raeside report, particularly in relation to measures to overcome barriers to equality and the setting of quotas and targets **\[IM6\]**. The Bill sets out a voluntary target of 50% female representation on public boards and a mandatory quota – both recommendations made in the research. It also places an expectation on public bodies to encourage more female applicants for board vacancies, using measures highlighted in the 2014 report, such as increasing awareness of vacancies through wider advertising, and more mentoring and social networking opportunities. The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament and became law in 2018. 

 **Employee ownership** 

 The Napier research, which provided evidence on the value and benefits of employee\-owned businesses, has underpinned the development of Scottish Government policy on employee ownership, leading to the establishment of a body, with substantial funding, to increase the numbers of EOBs. 

 The research, carried out for a non\-department public body of the Scottish Government, was further highlighted in two ways: 

-  through the media in 2014 and 2015 \(see articles on the research by the BBC and the Guardian\) **\[IM7\]** 

-  in evidence given by Dutton to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee of the Scottish Parliament **\[IM8\]**, as part of their inquiry into work, wages and wellbeing in the Scottish labour market. 

 During his evidence in October 2015, Dutton mentioned in particular the low levels of job turnover, sickness and absenteeism in EOBs, due to employees feeling they have a stake in the business **\[IM8 pp3\-5\]**. 

 The benefits highlighted in the Napier research are also cited by Co\-operative Development Scotland \(the arm of Scottish Enterprise that supports employee ownership and co\-operative business models\) in a video released in 2017 **\[IM9\]**. 

 The Government’s 2017\-18 programme for Scotland, which was informed by the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee inquiry, made a commitment to “ *investigate the scope to expand our support to employee ownership*” **\[IM10\]**. In August 2018, the Scottish Government made good on this commitment, launching ‘Scotland for EO’ and providing GBP75,000 to increase EOBs from 100 to 500 by 2030 **\[IM11\].**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Since 2008, real wages in the UK have stagnated. Gregg’s research at University of Bath has exposed the adverse consequences for workers – but also the beneficial effects of the statutory minimum wage. 

 The main UK Government response was the introduction in 2015 of the statutory National Living Wage \(NLW\). This increased to 60% of median national hourly earnings in 2020.  In addition, more than 6,000 employers in the UK have adopted the higher Voluntary Living Wage \(VLW\) set by the Living Wage Foundation. 

 Gregg’s research and policy advice has had a significant impact on the level and targeting of both the NLW and the VLW and hence on the wages and incomes, living standards and social welfare, of more than 6,000,000 low\-waged employees in the UK. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** *\[numbers in square brackets refer to the references in Section 3\]* 

 Following the financial crisis of 2008, the UK experienced a decade of stagnation in real wages.  According to the Bank of England, this was the worst such period since 1860. 

 Gregg and colleagues have published a series of studies concerned with the two periods when wages fell \(between 2009 \- 2014 and 2017\) and the brief recovery in between. These highlight how unusual this decade has been, with large falls in real wages but on the other hand only limited job losses. This is the opposite to previous UK recessions and the general pattern across the OECD **\[1,2,5\]**. 

 Gregg’s University of Bath research has focussed more specifically on wage stagnation among those in the lower portion of the wage distribution.  Gregg and Gardiner analyse wages for successive cohorts born after 1978 **\[4\]**.  The young have been particularly hard hit, with their wages in 2018 the same in real terms as wages for their counterparts 15 years previously. The research highlights their reduced chances of career progression by job moves and promotions, and hence their longer experience in lower paying occupations, with weaker growth in earnings **\[5\]**. 

 Gregg also undertook research during 2013, funded by the Low Pay Commission, into the effects of minimum wage laws in the UK **\[3\]**.  The study examined what happened when wages were raised to the new minimum, and whether this had any adverse effects on jobs surviving, hours, bonuses and non\-wage aspects of the contract \(e.g. zero hours or temporary\). 

 The minimum wage somewhat reduced hours worked, weakening its overall effect on weekly income.  However, it had little effect on levels of non\-basic pay, the use of temporary contracts or the provision of pensions by employers. Nor did it produce an increase in flexible employment arrangements, such as zero hours contracts. The minimum wage had only slight negative effects on a person’s likelihood of remaining in the same job a year later; this was no worse for young people than for older workers. 

 This research has led to academic publications and reports by the Resolution Foundation, disseminated widely in the media and policy\-making circles. This has connected to broader debates about generational fairness: whether young people will continue to see lower wages as they age, or will catch\-up as wage growth recovers.

 **4. Details of the impact** *\[Letters in square brackets refer to the references in Section 5\]* 

 Gregg’s research at University of Bath on the effects of minimum wage laws, demonstrating their positive benefits and the lack of any significant negative effects, has had a major impact on the development of the National Living Wage \(NLW\) and the Voluntary Living Wage \(VLW\). 

 Gregg has presented the research to the Bank of England Monetary Policy Roundtable \(November 2017\), the TUC \(January 2018\) and the Cabinet Office \(February 2018\). He gave a keynote presentation to the HM Treasury Labour Markets Conference \(September 2018\) and a joint Resolution Foundation/Bank of England seminar \(October 2018\), as well as to other more public\-orientated events and academic conferences. 

 Gregg’s research and expertise on the UK labour market, in terms of both wages and employment, also led to his membership of the two influential bodies below, looking at how to ensure higher wages for lower paid workers.  In both cases, Gregg’s research fed directly into their conclusions; it has thereby directly influenced public policies affecting the living standards and social welfare of more than 6,000,000 employees. 

 **National Living Wage \(NLW\)** 

 Gregg was a member of the **Resolution Foundation** review in 2014 of minimum wages, chaired by Sir George Bain \(the former Chair of the Low Pay Commission\) see Bain, G., Gregg, P., et al,: “ *More than a minimum: The resolution foundation review of the future of the national minimum wage: The final report*” \(March 2014\), Resolution Foundation **\[A\]**. This was strongly influenced by the research Gregg was undertaking at the time on wage stagnation in the lower portion of the wage distribution \[Section 2 above and research publications \(1\) and \(2\) in Section 3\]. 

 The Bain report was cited by George Osbourne, in the 2015 Budget, as key evidence influencing his decision to introduce the NLW for those aged 25 and over and with the target of increasing to 60% of median wages by 2020: *“I am today introducing a new national living wage. The Low Pay Commission will recommend future rises that achieve the Government’s objective of reaching 60% of median earnings by 2020. That is the minimum level of pay recommended in the report to the Resolution Foundation by Sir George Bain, the man the last Labour Government appointed as the first chair of the Low Pay Commission”* \(see Hansard **\[B\]** and HM Treasury 2015 **\[C:** para 3.2 **\]**\). 

 This bold policy shift was the more remarkable, given the general reluctance on the part of Conservative politicians to regulate the labour market.  Moreover, the proposed 60% of median hourly earnings is high by international standards \- only France and New Zealand, among advanced economies, are in this territory **\[D\].**  This raised concerns over the potential effects of higher minimum wages on employment and hours worked.  However, it was again research by Gregg with Kerry Papps \(2014\) \(research publication \(3\) in Section 3 above\) that was cited in the Treasury document for the new National Living Wage, to allay such fears: “ *While some empirical studies have found reductions in employment from increases in the minimum wage, these have generally been modest: see for example, Papps, K. and Gregg, P. \(2014\) and Galinda\-Rueda, F. and Pereira, S. \(2004\)”* \(see HM Treasury 2015 **\[C**: para 3.2 FN 56 **\]**\). These research findings were consistent with earlier research by the Centre for Economic Performance, LSE. 

 The scale of the change, to be rolled out between 2016 and 2020 was expected to be very large. The Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\) estimated in 2017 that 6,000,000 workers in the UK would be affected, depending on where they are in the wage distribution: 

-  750,000 who would have been on the existing national minimum wage had not the \(higher\) NLW been introduced; 

-  2,000,000 whose pay would have been above the NMW but whose pay is now raised at least to the NLW; 

-  3,250,000 whose pay was above the NLW but who through spill\-over effects will nevertheless get more, as firms seek to maintain some of the wage differential over the minimum. 

 The OBR estimated that the effect on weekly earnings, after factoring effects on hours worked and employment, would be GBP6 per week averaged across all groups.  This would represent just under GBP2,000,000,000 a year reaching low waged workers. **\[E\].** These numbers have been exceeded according to the LPC 2020 report for the period up to April 2019 **\[F** – page 9 **\].** This was due in part to rapid employment growth and slower wage growth in general, meaning NLW increases have had bigger effects. 

 **Voluntary Living Wage \(VLW\)** 

 Gregg also became a member of the **Living Wage Commission**, established by the Living Wage Foundation in 2017, to set the rates for the higher Voluntary Living Wage. The aim was to harmonise the process of setting rates for the national VLW and the London Living Wage; and to demonstrate to existing and potential VLW employers the guiding principles for future rate changes. The research behind the Commission’s setting of the 2017 VLW was published as “ *The Living Wage Commission \- Closing the Gap: A Living Wage that means families don’t go short”* \(September 2016\) **\[G\].**  The Commission continues to set the revised rates annually.  It also plays a key role, in providing some principles and forward guidance, to help support this growth. 

 A growing number of employers have sought accreditation by the Living Wage Foundation, signing up as a Living Wage Employer. Others shadow the wage rates set by the Foundation without accreditation **\[J\].** 

 The VLW has 6,500 accredited Living Wage employers, including 40% of FTSE 100 companies in 2020. It now directly covers 180,000 workers. More than 2,500 employers have joined the scheme since the Living Wage Commission was established in 2017. Many of these firms also require their contractors to meet the VLW.  Also, since 2017, and with the encouragement of the LWF, a number of ambitious plans have been drawn up to create Living Wage Places, towns and cities where all employers pay the VLW. Dundee, Glenrothes and Cardiff have formed employer/local council led coalitions to achieve this ambition **\[H, I, J\]**.  This shows the larger socio\-political impact that the LW debates and research evidence are having. 

 In all this, Gregg “ *played an invaluable role in forging the reputation of the LWC and in ensuring it plays a robust, independent and credible role in setting the Living Wage rates…. \[He\] quickly commanded the respect of the employer chief executives on the Commission as well as the General Secretary of the TUC and Deputy Mayor of London”* **\[J\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The impacts described in this case study of practice\-based research on Bolivian Baroque musical heritage are in two areas: **Creativity, culture and society**: enhancements to cultural heritage preservation and interpretation, new ways of thinking that influence artistic quality and audience reach; developing stimuli to cultural tourism and contributing to the quality of the tourist experience; research\-led engagement with marginalised and diverse audiences leading to increased cultural participation. **Social welfare**: improved social and educational inclusion of marginalised groups in a developing country \(Bolivia\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2002, Ashley Solomon’s professional ensemble Florilegium performed at the 4th Festival of Renaissance and Baroque Music Misiones de Chiquitos, Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The Chiquitos missions were established in the 1670s by European Jesuits, who introduced Catholic liturgical music and fostered local talent, developing a sophisticated musical culture. The legacy of this period forms a rich cultural heritage. Tens of thousands of music manuscripts from the 17th and 18th centuries \(the largest collection in the Americas\), most composed by Europeans but some by Indians, was preserved for generations by local guardians, but unknown to the outside world until a process of restoration and promotion in recent decades, led by Dr Piótr Nawrót SJ, a Polish musicologist based in Boliva. Traces of this heritage had also survived in a living song culture in remote and marginalised Guaraní Indian communities. 

 Since 2002, with the support of the Prince Claus Foundation \(Netherlands\), Solomon returned several times per year to work with Nawrót on the restoration of this largely forgotten Baroque music legacy, preparing modern editions, training young musicians in historical performance and reanimating the music in performance. In 2004, Solomon recruited four Bolivian vocal soloists to join Florilegium for their first CD of mission music, recorded in the Mission Church of Concepción. The following year, he formed the Arakaendar Bolivia Choir, made up of singers from across Bolivia, a significant intercultural initiative. Solomon commuted to Santa Cruz during 2005–6 to prepare the choir for that year’s Festival and to make a second CD recording together with them; a third CD was recorded in Holland during the choir’s first European tour in 2008 and released in 2010. These three CDs include 67 separate works with a combined duration of over three hours, selected from many more that have been reconstructed. They represent hundreds of hours of score preparation, rehearsals, and dozens of live concerts, including 34 since 2014. Meanwhile, in 2010, a Baroque orchestra was formed by Solomon, who initially sourced European\-made instruments for the musicians. Several have since been copied by local makers, creating the foundations of a new craft industry \(see below\). In 2014 the archives team identified fragments of 18c. scores with texts composed in the indigenous Guaraní language, an extraordinary find. They include villancicos for choir and orchestra and possibly an opera that includes vocal, orchestral and dance music. This discovery overturned the assumption that all musical compositions and productions were written in either Spanish or Latin to support the Jesuits’ evangelisation efforts and helps explain how remote communities kept their cultural identity intact during and after the expulsion of the Jesuits from Bolivia in 1767. In September 2014, Solomon travelled with Nawrót to the remote Guaraní village of Palmarito to work with its children’s choir, who joined the Arakaendar choir, its Baroque orchestra, 12 students from the Royal College of Music, and Norwegian Brass in four concerts of newly discovered music as part of the 10th Misiones de Chiquitos Festival. Further concerts with the Arkaendar choir and orchestra were led by Solomon at the 11th and 12th Festivals, and highlights from each Festival \(2016, 2018 and 2020\) were featured in associated CD recordings.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Enhancements to cultural heritage preservation and interpretation, new ways of thinking that influence artistic quality and audience reach**. 

 Working with Piotr Nawrót, who made transcriptions from the fragmentary manuscripts at the Mission Church of Concepción, since 2014 Solomon has prepared more than 30 performance scores of sacred and semi\-sacred 17th and 18th\-century Bolivian Baroque music \[ **5.1\]**. David Mollinedo, the mayor of Concepción, commented ‘The music forms a part of our identity. It may have come from Europe originally, but we have made it our own’ \[ **5.2**\]. Building on the work of the past 17 years, during which he established and developed two performing ensembles \(the Arakeandar Bolivia choir and Baroque orchestra\) to sing and play according to principles of historical performance practice and established them on the international stage, Solomon has introduced this music to international audiences, both at the biennial Festivals of Renaissance and Baroque Music Misiones de Chiquitos, and across the world through concert tours, recordings and broadcasts. He directed 15 concerts in Bolivia in 2014, 2016 and 2018, and on tour in the US in 2015 \[ **5.3**\]. Each run of performances is preceded by intensive periods of rehearsal and skills development sessions. For example, in 2017 and 2018, Solomon co\-taught four training workshops for Baroque string players with the internationally renowned Chilean violinist, Raul Orellano. As a result, Bolivia now has its first Baroque orchestra and choir in a position both to perform examples of the Bolivian musical heritage at a professional standard, and also to provide a training ground for future generations of musicians. 

 This has created the basis for some to establish careers as professional musicians and teachers. For example, Simón Aguape spent two years playing baroque violin in Arakaendar Baroque Orchestra, auditioning at the Musikhochschule in Frankfurt whilst on tour with the orchestra, where he was accepted to study Baroque violin, returning to Bolivia to teach in his home community in Urubichá. Cristina Zankis, a bank administrator and gifted violinist, was inspired to pursue her ambition to become a professional musician after becoming involved in Arakaendar projects. She completed a master's degree in violin performance at San Diego State University in 2010 and is currently studying at El Alto Public University for a Bachelor’s in Music. Zankis is now leader of the Santa Cruz Symphony Orchestra, as well as Arakaendar Baroque Orchestra \[ **5.4**\]. Meanwhile, Idebero Armoye, a carpentry instructor who has a workshop in Urubichá builds copies of Baroque string instruments from local cedar and mahogany; as he explains: ‘They were the only woods that could withstand the tropical heat’. There is now a thriving historical instrument\-building industry, that exports within Latin America, and also to Europe and the US \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **Research\-led engagement leading to improved social and educational inclusion of marginalized and diverse audiences in a developing country.** The most recent project undertaken by Solomon and Nawrót is the restoration in performance of some of the extraordinary discoveries of music with texts in the Guaraní language, described above. As part of this project, Solomon worked with the youth choir in the remote and marginalized community of Palmarito, that is serviced only by dirt\-track roads and lacks the most basic infrastructure. A local music\-teacher, Adelina Anori, who was in the original Arakaendar Bolivia choir while still at school, is now the director of music in Palmarito \[ **5.1**\]. Under her supervision, 60% of the children can read music although many do not otherwise read or write. In 2018, Solomon rehearsed with them in Palmarito, subsequently directing them together with Arakaendar and international musicians in concerts at various mission churches of works in Spanish and Guaraní, as part of the Festival de Chiquitos. Jose Ignacio Sanz, Director of Total E&P Bolivia which sponsored the project, commented: ‘Total is active in the Guaraní territory and when I had the chance to premiere music sung in Guaraní within the framework of the international Baroque festival, it seemed like a great opportunity to publicize and give visibility to the language, the culture and the Guarani people’ \[ **5.1**\]. A member of the audience in Santa Cruz said: 'It adds to our lives a spiritual dimension through words and history of our people in Chaco': another member of the Latin American Guaraní diaspora, interviewed by local television, agreed: ‘I come from Argentina, it's a long trip but it was worth it. I am very delighted and emotional. I am very excited as well'. Among those from Palmarito who took part, Arturo Cuellar said 'I hope we do more and have more choirs like this', while Viviana Zapata explained the importance of the wider impact of the event: 'this work will magnify our Guaraní people'. \[ **5.1**\] As a result of these performances, in 2019 the Palmarito choir and Urubichá instrumental ensemble were invited to Rome, where they sang in the Vatican at pontifical mass, and gave further concerts in Poland and Tuscany \[ **5.6**\]. 

 **Developing stimuli to cultural tourism and contributing to the quality of the tourist experience.** International awareness of the music of the Baroque era Jesuit missions has brought new audiences to Santa Cruz and its region and made a significant contribution to the growth of cultural tourism \[ **5.7, 5.8**\]. This in turn has stimulated the development of tourist infrastructure ranging from improvement of roads and provision of basic services such as electricity supply in remote villages, to new hospitality industry on the ‘Missions Route’. In 2015, the mayor of San Julián, whose population consists mainly of recently arrived immigrants from the impoverished Bolivian highlands, threatened to set up roadblocks if it was not allowed to participate in the following year’s festival. ‘Since the first music festival began, we have been recovering our music and our culture’, says Ronald Chinchi, 28, a music teacher in San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest of the mission towns; ‘Now, in all the towns, there are music schools, and the people are beginning to value their culture. It is growing all the time.’ \[ **5.2.**\] Ana Luisa Arce de Terceros, current President of *La Asociación Pro Arte y Cultura* \(APAC\) noted that the impact of the long collaboration with Ashley Solomon has included ‘significant improvement in the tourist infrastructure of the missionary peoples and important tourist influx.’ \[ **5.8**\] Of a concert in 2014, Charles Driskell wrote in *international Travel News*, ‘This fine musical evening was a highlight and the perfect ending to the festival’s offerings for our group…Nobody wished the concert to end.’ \[ **5.9**\] A 2018 study of tourism on the ‘Missions Route’ in the Chiquitos region by Juan de Dios Paramos Gomez, University of Mexico, included an analysis of why international visitors choose to visit the region; the Baroque music festival, spread across five mission church sites was by far the main reason \(26.3%\); he cited attendance figures for each Festival at c. 50,000 people per year \[ **5.10**\]. In May 2020, Guillermo Mariaca Iturri, President of the Board of the Cultural Foundation of the Central Bank of Bolivia \(FCBCB\), announced that immediate plans to help the Santa Cruz region cope with the economic consequences COVID\-19 include ‘the Baroque music of Eastern Bolivia’, stressing its importance to advancing Bolivian interculturality \[ **5.11**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 By 2000, it became evident that, in Wales, interest in, knowledge of, and capacity for computing was not keeping pace with the transformational rise of the digital society and economy. Technocamps, the pan\-Wales school and community outreach unit established at Swansea University, has researched, championed and delivered **change in national curricula, qualifications, delivery and professional development** in order to foster a sustainable digital skills pipeline in Wales. 

-  Following our **2013 Independent Review of the ICT** **Curriculum** commissioned by the Welsh Government, we led in reforming the subject of ICT and **defining and implementing** a new statutory bilingual **Digital Competence Framework \(DCF\)** for all pupils in Wales aged 3 to 16. 

-  We led on **embedding the DCF in schools** by delivering 10 hours of workshops in each of 97% of the nation’s secondary schools. Since 2016 the DCF has been the primary mechanism of developing cross\-curricular digital skills for **all pupils** **in** **all Welsh schools**. 

-  We were instrumental in supporting a major 2018 sector review of ICT qualifications in Wales, and **creating innovative GCSE and A\-Level qualifications** in Digital Technology. 

-  We led the **development** of the new **Science & Technology Area of Learning and Experience** in the new Curriculum for Wales, which brings together biology, chemistry, computer science, design & technology, and physics for all learners aged 3 to 16. 

-  We have engaged deeply – our standard programme being 4 full days of activity – with over **45,000 young people** since August 2013 \(7% of the Welsh population today aged 5\-21, with a nearly\-even gender balance\) to create an interest in the subject, particularly amongst young girls to address a desperately under\-represented community in the digital workforce. 

-  We have trained over **100 teachers** across Wales who lack a formal ICT/Computing background yet need to teach these subjects due to the shortage of qualified teachers \(given that 75% of those teaching ICT/Computing in Wales have no ICT/Computing background\). 

-  We led the **Institute of Coding in Wales** project, part of a wider Office for Students investment in England, **impacting on businesses** throughout Wales with bespoke innovative CPD opportunities, in particular trailblazer Degree Apprenticeships, giving them competitive edge and saving money; one apprenticeship project will **save its company GBP400,000 per year.** 

 The impact of this is **evidenced** by **significant changes** in Welsh **schools**, **teachers \(and thus, teaching practice\)**, **pupils, businesses,** and in the **publication of the new** **Curriculum for Wales in January 2020**, to start from September 2022. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 1995, the Department of Computer Science established an industrial liaison unit, **ITWales**, to **facilitate impact of Swansea researchers on the Welsh economy** through intervention and engagement **.** ITWales was **highlighted in the EPSRC International Review** of ICT in 2006 and is **cited in the** **acknowledgements of research papers published by academics across the Welsh universities**. The Founding Director of ITWales, Beti Williams, won **Best Woman in Academia and Public Sector** category in the **Blackberry** **Woman of the Year** Awards 2006, and was appointed **MBE** in 2012 for pioneering work on small businesses. 

 Through two decades of research, cited and summarised in section 2.3 below and references \[ **R1\-R6**\], we identified a growing **need for direct school interventions** to address a crisis in computing and digital skills education. This **led to the creation of Technocamps** in 2003, supported by a sequence of grants, most recently \[ **G1\-G6**\]. Its mission is to provide a wide spectrum of activities aimed at identifying and addressing shortcomings in computing education and skills, covering all aspects of: awareness\-raising through engagement; curriculum and qualifications reform; policy and practice; and initial teacher education and professional development. More widely, its commitment to computer science education extends to widening participation, providing digital upskilling opportunities to people in employment as well as various opportunities for lifelong learning. 

 Microsoft was an early supporter of Technocamps, and subsequently created the *Computing at School* \(CAS\) initiative in England in 2008. CAS is largely run by and for teachers, contrasting Technocamps’ direct intervention by, and engagement with, University academics. Whilst the CAS approach is well suited to urban areas with critical masses of schools and capable teachers \[ **R1**\], **our research indicates that direct intervention is critical** elsewhere – and in particular throughout Wales. Analyses of the impact of each approach reported in \[ **R2, R3**\] – co\-authored by the Director of Technocamps and the Chair of CAS Wales – **evidence** the **inadequacies of the CAS approach in Wales in contrast to the impact of Technocamps**’ direct intervention methodology. 

 We have explored different models for introducing and embedding competence and confidence in the nation’s computing teachers, as well as means to increase the pipeline into the profession amongst computing graduates, reporting these models in various **research publications**: which succeeded and which failed, analysing why, and evidencing impact. In particular, in \[ **R4**\] we describe the impact of our direct teacher intervention programme and **evidence the need for its methodology**; and in \[ **R5**\] we reflect on a school placement scheme we introduced which has impacted positively on the participating schools as well as generated a stream of graduates into teacher training. Our efforts in improving education in schools has in return impacted positively on our undergraduate teaching as described in \[ **R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 From researching the relevant issues since 2000, and by establishing Technocamps in 2003 as a formal unit in which to do so, our influence and impact has been steadily growing – within government, and on schools, school children and teachers across the nation – in: advocating for a need for curriculum reform; stimulating a demand for these; producing the defining reports on these; introducing these within the nation’s schools; and providing much\-needed professional development for teachers to deliver them, in Welsh and English. Our main impact since August 2013 has been in three areas: 

1.  The creation and embedding of a new national **Digital Competence Framework**. 

1.  **Curriculum reform** leading to the transformation of ICT education, and the development of a new Science & Technology Area of Learning and Experience. 

1.  The creation of **new GCSE and A\-level** **qualifications in** **Digital Technology**. 

 **4.1 The Digital Competence Framework** 

 In his Keynote Speech at the 2012 Technocamps Annual Conference, the Minister for Education and Skills for Wales created an environment for impact for Technocamps by declaring that: 

 *“Technocamps is an important driver in making sure learners in Wales are best placed to take advantage of opportunities \[in the expanding digital workforce\]. I would encourage headteachers to ensure that their school is engaged with Technocamps.”* \[ **C1**\] 

 He also announced the creation of the digital learning platform, *Hwb*, supported by a *National Digital Literacy Council*, with Moller and Crick as expert advisors; and subsequently commissioned a subject review co\-chaired by Crick with Moller as a panel member. The September 2013 ICT Review Report published by this panel proposed the introduction of a **Digital Competence Framework** \(DCF\) to sit alongside the existing *Numeracy and Literacy Frameworks*. This proposal was picked up and included as a recommendation in “ *Successful Futures: Independent Review of Curriculum and Assessment Arrangements in Wales*” \(March 2015\). According to the author of this work: 

 *“The ICT review was influential in my curriculum review in two ways: I adopted its recommendation for increasing the prominence of cross\-curricular digital skills, resulting in the DCF; and it fed into my thinking in embedding computer science into the Science and Technology AoLE.”* \[ **C2**\] 

 This recommendation was immediately adopted by Welsh Government, and Crick led digital pioneer teachers in developing its content. According to the Welsh Government Minister of Education, 

 *“The Digital Competence Framework owes much to Professor Crick’s leadership. He took a leading role in defining the DCF, chairing its development to publication for all schools in Wales in September 2016.”* \[ **C3**\] 

 The DCF was introduced in a phased fashion into schools starting in September 2018, to be fully integrated in all schools at all levels from September 2021, with an effort led by Technocamps. In 2018, Technocamps was commissioned by the Minister of Education to facilitate the introduction of the DCF in schools with a project to deliver 3\-hour workshops in secondary schools. This was in recognition of the impact of Technocamps’ direct intervention model \(see \[ **R4\-R5**\] above\). By the end of the 18\-month project, due to numerous requests for return visits, we averaged over 10 hours of workshops in each of more than 97% of the nation’s secondary schools. The impact of this intervention is evidenced by letters from schools, the following quote from a school head being indicative: 

 *“Technocamps played an essential role in the introduction and implementation of the DCF within our school. The support provided was invaluable and provided a springboard to ensure an effective take\-up throughout the school.”* \[ **C4**\] 

 **4.2 The Future of Science & Technology Education in Wales** 

 As part of the wider Curriculum for Wales reforms as outlined in “Successful Futures” \(2015\), Crick was invited to **lead the future vision of Science &Technology education**, by chairing one of the six new *Areas of Learning and Experience* \(AoLE\). The Science & Technology AoLE brings together the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, design & technology, and physics for all learners in Wales aged 3 to 16. This was a radical innovation from the current national curriculum in Wales, providing the opportunity for interdisciplinary cross\-curricular learning, as well as the first time that computer science was recognised as a core subject. As part of these reforms, Crick was also appointed in 2017 to **chair the National Network for Excellence in Science & Technology \(NNEST\),** with Moller as a board member, a £4M strategic investment by the Welsh Government to support the professional development of teachers in this key area of the new *Curriculum for Wales*. The NNEST has demonstrably improved confidence and capability for STEM practitioners in Wales, with major research\-led policy and practice initiatives across primary and secondary\-level settings, in partnership with all HE institutions in Wales. It has also directly contributed to the development of a new national strategy for educational research and enquiry in Wales. According to the Welsh Government Minister of Education: 

 *“Professor Crick has played a leading role working on the Science and Technology AoLE, as well as being inaugural chair of the National Network of Excellence in Science and Technology \(NNEST\), both of which included Professor Moller as an expert advisor. I have been clear on the importance of higher education's wider civic mission agenda and specifically the body of knowledge and activities which Technocamps represents as a pan\-Wales organisation involving all of the nation’s higher education institutions.”* \[ **C3**\] 

 **4.3 New Qualifications in Digital Technology** 

 In 2012, the Minister of Education in England declared that ICT education was not fit for purpose and that ICT qualifications \(GCSE and A\-level\) would be removed, leaving computer science as the only digital qualification. In response, *Qualifications Wales* \(QW\) – the body created in 2015 to regulate all qualifications in Wales below HE level – established a working group to consider the future of ICT in Wales. As members of this group, we were vocal in recognising ICT as a worthy qualification distinct from computer science. However, we also saw scope for wholly new qualifications which would address the *use* of digital technology, and we proposed that QW develop thinking towards the creation of **new** **GCSE and A\-level qualifications in Digital Technology**. 

 We worked with QW in developing these ideas and hosted the launch of their **Review of ICT Provision Report, **“Delivering Digital” \(December 2018\), which announced the introduction of these new qualifications. We have subsequently been sitting on their Advisory Group developing the frameworks for these qualifications; and we are working on the **development of the GCSE curriculum, and on teaching and learning resources** to provide the professional development that will be much needed by the teachers that will be delivering this from September 2021. Our impact in driving this change is acknowledged by the Director of QW: 

 *“Qualifications Wales is grateful for the advice and support that Technocamps has provided. We are benefitting from this, in defining the new curriculum and in making it a reality. Due to their national recognition and reach, we very much view Technocamps as a one\-stop shop for expertise, knowledge, and implementation of computing and digital education for Wales.”* \[ **C5**\] 

 **4.4 Wider Impact** 

 Besides the profound impact on education that we have had through the DCF and curriculum reform, Technocamps has had further impact across a wide spectrum of stakeholders and beneficiaries \(see \[ **C9**\] for general testimonials\). 

-  **We impact teachers** by providing professional development opportunities \(see research references \[ **R4,R5**\] above\) to enable them to deliver the new computing curriculum and qualifications – particularly necessary given that only 25% of the nation’s Computing/ICT teachers have a relevant background. Since 2015, we have been providing a programme of study requiring teachers to spend one day per fortnight on Swansea University campus throughout the year. In the first year, **13 teachers** completed the programme; and in the second year, a further **17 teachers** did so. The popularity of the programme has grown due to its impact on participating schools, to the point where in 2018, **43 teachers** graduated from the course. This programme is directly impacting on substantial numbers of young people, as evidenced in various case studies. For example, one Assistant Headteacher in a remote school, having undertaken our teacher training programme, introduced GCSE Computing in her school for a healthy\-sized cohort, resulting in 84% scoring A\* to C \(with 26% scoring A\*\) against a national average of 49% A\*\- C. In her support letter, she writes: 

 *“This excellent result would not have been possible without Technocamps support.”* \[ **C6**\] 

-  **We impact young people** by enlightening them on the wider benefits of studying computer science and related STEM subjects at GCSE and A\-level and beyond. Since August 2013, we have engaged with 45,000 young people – 7% of the Welsh population today aged 5\-24 – with a nearly even gender balance **.** There has been a dramatic year\-on\-year increase in the number of first\-year computer science students at Swansea: from 150 starting in October 2015, to 250 starting in October 2016, to 350 starting in October 2017 \(despite the entry requirements being made slightly more stringent\). Whilst there are various factors for this, Technocamps has had a demonstrable influence on this trend: potential students and their parents regularly acknowledge Technocamps during University Visit Days as a brand they recognise and of which they have had a positive experience. Furthermore, the work of Technocamps ensures that this growing pipeline is not only greater but populated by students who have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject. \( **Data available in** \[ **C8**\] **.\)** 

-  **We impact businesses** through the **Institute of Coding \(IoC\) in Wales**. In 2018, the Prime Minister Theresa May announced the establishment of the National *Institute of Coding \(IoC\)*, a three\-year, GBP20,000,000 academic think tank representing a collaboration of 20 universities aimed at widening participation and expanding the pipeline of students into computer science education. As a HEFCE\-funded initiative, only universities in England benefit \(financially\) from this initiative. However, due to the recognition of the work of Technocamps in Wales, Swansea University was included in the tender to HEFCE. Once it was launched, HEFCW provided support for the *IoC in Wales* under Professor Moller’s Directorship through a GBP1,200,000 grant to Swansea University. This has facilitated our successful **Degree Apprenticeship** programme, and in 2019 we produced the first cohort of Degree Apprenticeship Graduates in Wales, with many strong case studies being provided. According to the Director of EPS Construction, the final\-year software project that their apprentice carried out reaped unexpectedly great benefits: 

 *“This software will save EPS £400,000 per year, already saving £70,000 on one of our completed trial job.”* \[ **C7**\] 

-  **We impact Swansea University**, through \(i\) driving the establishment of *CoSMOS: the College of Science Margam Outreach Space* in 2019, a unique facility embodying and underpinning the University’s civic mission agenda; \(ii\) providing positive reform to the pedagogic underpinning of the undergraduate programme as described above \(research reference **\[R6\]** above\); and \(iii\) through the establishment in 2018 of a cross\-disciplinary research group *EHP: Educational, Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Computer Science* as the research arm of Technocamps. 

-  **We impact the UK University Leadership**, through the establishment of an *Outreach Committee* of *CPHC: the Council of Professors and Heads of Computing*. Technocamps Swansea was to host the first meeting held by this committee in April 2020, though the Covid\-19 pandemic forced its cancellation. An aim of this Committee, with membership from all four nations of the UK, is to determine how to transfer the successful university\-based model of Technocamps in Wales \(research reference \[ **R3**\] above\) to the three other nations.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Well\-functioning teams are crucial for success in sporting, military and commercial domains. Sussex\-led research into social identity processes and motives was adapted into a new consultancy intervention – TRIBE – which boosts team performance by developing and instilling a strong sense of shared identity among team members. TRIBE\-based team\-building and training interventions have been used successfully with eight elite sports teams, ten military clients, and 13 commercial organisations, leading to changes in training practices, sporting successes, adoption of the model by senior leaders, and improved satisfaction and performance in corporate teams. The same Sussex research has also underpinned separate consultancy interventions with a further 11 commercial organisations. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research into social identities examines how people come to see themselves as belonging to groups or social categories, and the consequences of doing so. Previous research has thus established the benefits of social identities for health and well\-being, for collective action, and for organisational and group outcomes. For example, social identification among employees has been shown to predict organisational commitment, stronger work motivation, higher performance, more “organizational citizenship” behaviours, lower attrition, and better customer service. Boosting social identification is thus a valuable goal for organisational interventions. 

 To foster social identification and hence obtain these benefits, it is crucial to understand the motives underlying people’s identity processes. Sussex social psychologists have originated and led the way in research into *identity motives*, with contributions from international colleagues for cross\-cultural comparisons. Vignoles lead\-authored an influential 2006 paper \(R1\) which combined ideas from social, personality, and developmental psychology to investigate the roles of six identity motives in identity formation: Participants in four studies structured their identities so as to feel they were positively valued \( *self\-esteem*\), persistently the same over time \( *continuity*\), distinct from others \( *distinctiveness*\), competent and capable \( *efficacy*\), included and accepted by others \( *belonging*\), and that their lives mattered for something \( *meaning*\). Hence, Vignoles developed *Motivated Identity Construction Theory* \(MICT **;** R2\) to illuminate which forms of identity people will find most appealing, what kinds of events may threaten people’s sense of identity, and which actions they might take to bolster their identities. MICT highlights the importance of five identity motives \(continuity, meaning, distinctiveness, belonging, efficacy\) over and above the already well\-researched self\-esteem motive \(R2\). Sussex\-led studies have demonstrated the relevance of these motives to shaping people’s sense of personal identity \(R1\), their desired and feared future identities \(R3\), and their identification with groups and social categories \(R1, R4\). Predictions of the theory received cross\-cultural support in a large ESRC\-funded project among over 50 cultural groups spanning all inhabited continents, led by Vignoles and Brown with Becker \(e.g. R5\). 

 In 2014, Brown was asked by the private consultancy company *Centre for Team Excellence* \(CfTE\) to explore the utility of applying MICT to enhance team performance. They expected that harnessing the six identity motives could be useful in enhancing team identification and hence team performance. From 2014, Will Thomas \(PhD student of Brown and Vignoles\) was jointly funded by the ESRC and CfTE to examine this. With Brown, Vignoles, Easterbrook, Holt \(CfTE\), and two international colleagues, Thomas conducted a longitudinal study to examine the role of the six identity motives in predicting changes in group identification among members of amateur teams from 14 different sports. Findings published in 2017 showed how each motive contributed in specific ways to predicting how strongly an individual identified with the team over time \(R4\). The researchers also monitored the success of each team over a 9\-month period. They found a positive relationship between team identification and performance, such that teams in the strongest identifying quintile outperformed those in the weakest identifying quintile by 53%. Crucially, time\-sensitive analyses confirmed that higher team identification preceded positive performance, rather than vice versa, which supported their theoretical expectation that team identification has a causal impact on performance \(R6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Translating MICT into a consultancy model: TRIBE** 

 From 2014, Jeremy Holt, Managing Director of CfTE, worked with Thomas to transpose the research insights of MICT into a suite of consultancy interventions to enhance team identity, motivation, and performance—which they called the **TRIBE** model \(C1, C2\). They translated MICT’s five identity motives beyond self\-esteem into non\-academic language as **T**raditions \( *continuity*\), **R**elevance \( *meaning*\), **I**dentity \( *distinctiveness*\), **B**elonging \( *belonging*\) and **E**ffectiveness \( *efficacy*\), making the acronym: TRIBE \(Fig. 1, C1\). The TRIBE consultancy model focuses on harnessing these five identity motives to boost team identification and hence desired outcomes, comprising four stages: \(1\) an online assessment tool to evaluate initial satisfaction of identity motives \(TeamMARK: adapted by Holt, Thomas, Brown and Vignoles from measures developed at Sussex for R4\), \(2\) workshops designed to build identity motive satisfaction and thus team identification, \(3\) a one\-month follow\-up session, and \(4\) monitoring subsequent progress \(C1, C2\). Two white papers produced by CfTE outline the main principles of team\-building in TRIBE, explaining in detail that MICT and the Sussex research provide the basis of the programme \(C1\). 

  

 *Fig.1.* The TRIBE model \(from C1\). 

 The TRIBE model is now at the centre of CfTE’s consultancy work \(examples below\) to build team identification and hence performance for clients, including elite sports teams, armed forces, commercial and educational organisations \(C2\). Between 01/08/2013 and 31/12/2020, 33 clients benefited from the TRIBE model, including eight elite sports teams, 13 corporations, 10 areas of the British military and security services, and three university clients. Revenue from interventions with these clients exceeded \[text removed for publication\] \(C2\). 

 **Enhancing team identity and performance in elite sports teams** 

 Since 2014, CfTE has worked with the Olympic Gold Medal winning GB \[text removed for publication\] team, \[text removed for publication\] County Cricket Club, the \[text removed for publication\] Rugby Team, the \[text removed for publication\], and the GB Speedway Team, using the TRIBE model to develop stronger team identities, often followed by performance gains \(C2\). 

 After an unsuccessful season in 2015, \[text removed for publication\] County Cricket Club worked with CfTE to develop a compelling team identity, reduce dressing room conflict, and increase collaboration and commitment. Performance subsequently improved, culminating in winning the \[text removed for publication\], one of three domestic trophies \(C2\). Similarly, following input in 2016 from CfTE on the team’s identity, \[text removed for publication\] team won the \[text removed for publication\] for the first time in 6 years \(C2\). From May 2015 to February 2016, CfTE worked with the GB \[text removed for publication\] team, coaches and sports psychologist to strengthen team identity and build resilience \(C2\). Statements by team members evidence the role of team identity motives in their subsequent Rio 2016 Olympic \[text removed for publication\] Medal victory, which was the first time the team had achieved \[text removed for publication\]. Team member \[text removed for publication\] explained at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Ceremony: “ *We worked really really hard as a squad to create our **identity**” \(C1, p. 9 of pdf\). In a video published days after the victory, team members described their sense of shared identity in terms that reflected the MICT/TRIBE motives: 

-  *“We are 31 women who are **driven**, very **dedicated**, who come together with a very common **goal**.” \(group meaning / relevance\) 

-  “*This team is very **special**.*” \(group distinctiveness / identity\) 

-  “*As long as we **stick together** as a group then that’s what’s key.*” \(group belonging\) 

-  “*It’s competitive but you’re fighting to make the team **the best it can be**.” \(group efficacy / effectiveness\) \(C3\). 

 Direct corroboration of the causal role of TRIBE, and hence the Sussex research, in improving sports team identity and performance comes from two elite teams: the GB Speedway Team and the \[text removed for publication\] Team, each of which have used the TRIBE since 2018. The Managing Director of the GB Speedway Team reports that: “ *We have used the TRIBE model to develop a new distinctive team identity focused on “Breaking the Mould”, which has contributed to significant changes in our culture, the way we approach performance and operate as a team.*” His testimonial details how they have worked with each of the five identity motives to effect positive changes in the teams’ sense of identity, training processes, and engagement with stakeholders \(C4\). 

 \[text removed for publication\] sports psychologist cites the Sussex research in his account of the first seven months of \[text removed for publication\] use of the TRIBE model, explaining how the model was embraced first by team coaches and then by the players, and describing initial interventions and outcomes \(C5\). The team later developed their TRIBE “identity canvas” through several iterations \(Fig. 2, C5\), which played a prominent role in induction and training of players. \[text removed for publication\] 

 According to the team’s psychologist, recent successes are attributable to TRIBE and the Sussex research into identity motives: 

 “team members have embraced TRIBE and have spent many hours discussing and agreeing a clear compelling statement of “who we are” based on the Sussex University research on identity motives. \[This\] has had a profound impact on team strategy, training and performance in tournaments. In 2019 we won our first ever world ranking tournament \[text removed for publication\], and we believe we are on track for a medal in \[text removed for publication\] ... The TRIBE programme and the use of the identity motives model have enabled us to implement meaningful changes to our programme which reinforce our identity and drive key behaviours which in turn have driven improved performance.” \(C5\). 

 **Leadership training and organisational interventions for military clients** 

 From 2016 to 2019, CfTE worked with senior and middle leadership teams in MOD \[text removed for publication\] \(\~1200 employees, \[text removed for publication\] for Royal Navy and Fleet Auxiliary\), using TRIBE to develop strong team identities, improve staff satisfaction, and reduce turnover \(C2\). In early 2017, CfTE used the TRIBE model to review the \[text removed for publication\] identity, after negative media coverage of violent incidents; confidential recommendations to *“reboot and strengthen* \[text removed for publication\] *identity*” were accepted by \[text removed for publication\] and *“implemented subject to budget constraints*” \(C2\). 

 CfTE has developed TRIBE\-based leadership training for the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom \(C2, C6\). As part of this, TRIBE\-based training has included lectures delivered annually \(for three years\) to a total of 900\+ officers \(70% from British armed forces, 30% from NATO/international allies\), and a training course attended annually by 15\-20 security service officers \(C2\). 

 TRIBE was used in the \[text removed for publication\], in a module for senior British military officers and civil servants \(e.g. Colonel, Brigadier: \~400 attendees to date\) to help build more efficient teams across services and with international allies \(C2\). Comments from module participants evidence change in senior officers’ thinking following attendance of the course, for example: “ *TRIBE tool is very useful and I intend to use it straight away*”; “ *I will definitely be trying this with my team. It genuinely made me think differently about collaboration and embracing diversity*” \(C6\). 

 **Improving multiple outcomes for commercial organisations** 

 CfTE has used the TRIBE model with 13 corporations, including major and emerging tech \(\[text removed for publication\]\), financial \(e.g. \[text removed for publication\], Rabobank\), and pharmaceutical \(\[text removed for publication\]\) companies, to improve employees’ commitment, performance, resilience and well\-being \(C2\). Separately, MICT has been used directly in consultancy work with 11 commercial organisations in Italy and the UK, including the Italian state railways \(FS\), an international fashion company \(YNAP\), an international TV channel \(Discovery\), a cooperative bank \(Banca Etica\), a government agency \(Invitalia\), an engineering and construction company \(Gavio\), and a major national services provider \(Coopservice\), as well as an association of over 200 Italian and multinational companies that seeks to promote diversity and inclusion in business \(Valore D: 34 companies directly involved\) \(C7\). Prof. Claudia Manzi, who collaborated with Vignoles in much of the original research into MICT \(R1, R3\-R6\), delivered these consultancies which included measuring the satisfaction of identity motives among >29,000 employees and members of these organisations and offering advice on how to foster motive satisfaction, organisational identification, and desired outcomes \(C7\). 

 For \[text removed for publication\], CfTE ran “train\-the\-trainer” seminars in Europe, North America, the Middle East and East Asia, teaching an adaptation of the TRIBE model to 150 trainers responsible for training 6000\+ managers of a workforce of 20,000\+ employees \(C2\). 

 Direct evidence that these interventions improved multiple outcomes comes from a testimonial from the Global Head F&A Sector Banking for Rabobank. He describes the use of TRIBE to foster team identity among their Acquisition Finance team \(65 professionals and dedicated credit staff\), in words reflecting the MICT/TRIBE motives: 

 “The TRIBE methodology was very helpful in starting to rebuild a sense of team and purpose. Working on a history and timeline of the team brought an agreed sense of what the team had achieved and where we had come from and allowed us to identify what we were good at and what needed to improve. … \[It gave us\] an agreed history and set of values \- sense of team, who we were was clear , … Our goals and values were not bland corporate bullshit but meaningful to the team” \(C8\). 

 Developing a stronger sense of team identity helped the team to maximise benefits from a new organisational strategy. These benefits included: 

 “a far more effective MT \[Management Team\], less conflict, better meetings due to improved skill and trust, clear rules of engagement and clarity and agreement on what we were trying to do... Delivering two deals out of the new strategy was another moment where everyone started to believe a little more” \(C8\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Software Systems Engineering Group at UCL developed and patented xlinkit, an approach that supports the validation of XML documents in general and over\-the\-counter \(OTC\) derivative transactions expressed in the Financial Products Markup Language \(FpML\). The widespread adoption of FpML—also adopted by JP Morgan Chase’s Extensions for securities, repos and security lending \(95% of financial market participants now use it for OTC transactions\)—has brought about a substantial reduction in market and credit risk for financial institutions, by reducing the time required to confirm derivative transactions from up to ten days to at most one day. About 500 validation rules have been defined for FpML using xlinkit. They define, for example, the constraints that check that the cashflows in an order for a derivative instrument match those held by a counterparty in a confirmation or that payment periods of the agreed cashflows equally divide the contract period. This reduction critically relies on very high straight\-through\-processing rates, which cannot be achieved if manual interventions are required. High straight\-through\-processing rates are critically reliant upon a high level of consistency within the OTC contracts, which xlinkit crucially provides. These consistency rules are formally defined in xlinkit and can be automatically checked by FpML validation products. This innovation is especially important given the high value of OTC derivatives, which rose to USD640,400,000,000,000 per annum at the end of June 2019. Message Automation \(which markets a product called Message Automation Validator, based on xlinkit patent\) has received GBP3,000,000 revenue in that same period. Following the acquisition of Message Automation by Broadridge in 2017, xlinkit remains an essential part of Broadridge Financial Solutions software platform, among others, now in use by over 50 financial institutions globally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The background of the research that led to xlinkit was Professor Wolfgang Emmerich and Professor Anthony Finkelstein’s work on consistency management of structured and semi\- structured software engineering artefacts, usually source\-code documents. The consistency management of such documents required three elements: 1\) the representation of **abstract syntax trees** and graphs; 2\) the **definition of validation rules** to define **static semantics and inter\-document consistency constraints**; and 3\) the construction of **validation engines** that can execute these rules. 

 The adoption of the Internet standards for managing semi\-structured documents—most notably XML—created the possibility of applying similar techniques to documents other than source codes. Similar in nature to abstract syntax trees, representation of such semi\-structured XML documents is governed by the Document Object Model \(DOM\). Thus, the UCL Software Systems Engineering Research Group explored whether the principles, methods and techniques for consistency management of software engineering artefacts could be realised more elegantly using the emerging family of standards on XML that were being defined at the same time by the World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C\)—thereby making them applicable to a broader application area and semi\-structured documents that are managed in a decentralised manner. A decentralised setting necessitated managing the consistency relationships out of bounds from the documents being related. The XLink standard of the W3C enabled the management of such out\-of\-bound relationships and the research focused on how such XLink relationships could be defined and created in an effective and efficient manner. 

 Xlinkit defines a first order rule language, which combines universal and existential quantification with Boolean logic operators over path expressions defined using the XPath standard. Through further work, researchers under the supervision of Professors Emmerich and Finkelstein then developed three different interpretations for the xlinkit language. The first interpretation showed how the language determines whether two distributed semi\-structured documents are consistent with each other \( **R1**\). A second interpretation defines how out\-of\-bound links that capture consistency relationships between elements in two semi\-structured distributed documents \( **R1**\) are inferred. And the third interpretation defines how the language determines for two distributed documents that are inconsistent with each other all possible modifications that render them consistent again \( **R3**\). The initial application of this research was to demonstrate how to manage the consistency of software engineering documents \( **R2, R4**\). 

 Once the wide applicability of the basic research on consistency management using XML technologies became evident, UCL protected the IP of the underlying research by patenting it in the US and UK. UCL then created a spin\-out company called Systemwire, appointed a CEO to run the company and moved to develop a commercial application of the research results. This application has been available since early 2002. 

 During Spring 2002, UBS, UCL and Systemwire proposed the creation of the FpML Validation Working Group to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association \(ISDA\), which was submitted in June 2002 \( **R6**\). ISDA accepted the proposal and the FpML Validation working group was created in autumn 2003. It was chaired by Christian Nentwich, Wolfgang Emmerich’s PhD student and had wide industry participation from BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Capital, UBS and JP Morgan. The Validation working group then used the xlinkit language called Constraint Language in XML \(clix\) to formulate consistency rules for derivative transactions defined using the FpML standard \( **R5**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Financial services institutions who trade in over\-the\-counter \(OTC\) derivatives have benefitted significantly from research conducted at the UCL Software Systems Engineering Research Group, as the notional outstanding contract value of OTC derivatives increased during the first half of 2019 to USD640,400,000,000,000, an 18% increase from the first half of 2017 \( **S1**\). FpML remains an open standard maintained by ISDA for documenting, dealing and processing OTC derivatives \( **R5**\), and FpML offers a cost\-effective alternative for electronic communication of derivative contract information \( **S2**\). This innovation has reduced the time required to confirm derivative transactions from up to ten days to one day at most, thereby significantly reducing risk and exposure for financial market participants. The FpML validation rules continue to be defined using UCL’s xlinkit technology, and the adoption of FpML continues to increase in the financial service sector. 

 <ins> **FpML standard version 5.11 and validation rules**</ins> 

 The current Version 5.11 of the FpML standard \(recently revised in July 2020\) was released in December 2019 to continuously support service users. Like previous FpML versions, the latest release is governed by validation rules developed by the UCL team \( **R1, R6**\), which are “an **integral part of the FpML standard providing business logic validation in addition to the schema validation,”** according to the Senior Director and Co\-head of Data Reporting and FpML at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association \( **S3**\). Different parts of the trade cycle therefore benefit from “an additional layer of business logic validation that cannot be enforced through XML schema” \( **S3**\). The validation architecture written as a result of the underpinning research \( **R6**\) now defines some 500 validation rules for a large number of equities, interest rates, credit, energy and foreign exchange derivatives. 

 These rules help clarify the meaning of derivative transactions defined in FpML and provide precise and unambiguous means for market participants using FpML to electronically trade derivatives to validate the correctness of these transactions. The validation rules are included in the normative part of the standard, which means that the financial market participants that have adopted FpML will have to comply with these validation rules in their FpML messages. As such, Message Automation continues to provide a reference implementation of these rules using its xlinkit technology, as it continues to be included in Version 5.11 of the FpML standard. This latest version has informed the continued adoption of electronic processing implemented between August 2013 and December 2020. Thus, the substantial introduction of electronic confirmation with FpML \(which can be validated automatically\) has reduced manual effort and brought down the time required to confirm derivative transactions from up to 10 days to at most one day. This reduction means **there is also a substantial reduction in the period during which a financial market participant is subject to market and credit risk because a contract is not yet confirmed**. Given the value of these transactions confirmed by the FpML surveys, this risk reduction is very significant. Some financial market participants have stated these benefits publicly. 

 <ins> **Continued use of</ins> <ins>xlinkit</ins> <ins>language for financial services**</ins> 

 A recent survey on progress made by firms incorporating the FpML standard gathered data from 33 participating firms including dealers, asset managers, technology companies, assets and fund managers, trade repositories, clearing houses and execution facilities \( **S4**\). These vendors benefit from **the clarity and unambiguity introduced through the validation rules defined using UCL’s consistency\-checking technology with xlinkit**. FpML continues to be used for regulatory reporting in major jurisdictions and reporting systems in Asia, Europe and in the USA. As such, participating vendors reported **10,000,000 daily FpML messages**, showing a “ **large increase in message volume compared to the last survey**” and continuous implementation of UCL technology \( **S4**\). All messages recorded abide by the validation rules defined in the xlinkit underpinning research \( **R6**\). 

 The ISDA found a significant level of adoption of electronic confirmations for different classes of OTC derivatives. The adoption rate of electronic confirmations for all market participants was 81% for interest rates derivatives, 16% foreign exchange and 3% distributed among credit derivatives, commodities, equity and other derivatives \( **S1**\). The adoption of FpML by the financial services sector has become widespread, with **76% of the financial market participants** dealing with recordkeeping view and **62% dealing with confirmation view** \( **S4**\). Moreover, **39% of dealers and 30% of technology and asset management** participants implement the FpML validation rules defined with xlinkit \( **S4**\).  In addition, 64% of the firms that responded to the survey use tools to convert or translate FpML to other formats or from other formats to FpML depending on firms’ needs, while 45% specified using binding tools for FpML application development. This has provided an opportunity for technology firms to develop tools related to FpML: of the technology firms surveyed, 50% provide tools to create, transform or parse FpML, while 40% provide interfaces to and from systems and 20% offer system integration and/or validation services. 

 <ins> **Xlinkit</ins> <ins>technology through Message Automation \(</ins><ins>Broadridge</ins> <ins>Financials</ins><ins>\)**</ins> 

 The ability to check whether a trade meets all relevant constraints automatically, and therefore with minimal cost, significantly reduces the time it takes to confirm these transactions \( **R1, R2**\), with fewer operations staff required. This advantage highlights the flexibility of the xlinkit solution through Message Automation, where there is a “ **proven track record \- 100% of clients happy**,” in turn building “long\-term relationships with a wide range of clients inducing Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks and buy\-side organisations” \( **S5**\). By using Message Automation, financial market participants are therefore exposed to market and credit risk during a shorter period between a trade being agreed and its confirmation. 

 In 2017, Message Automation was acquired by Broadridge \( **S6**\) for about **GBP45,000,000,** attesting to the technology’s value for the financial services sector. The most recent revenue sharing report from 17 December 2019 states that UCL Business has received royalty income from this patent in the amount of GBP462,838.95 since 2003. Between May 2017 and December 2019, **GBP150,000** of this income was received from Broadridge, suggesting the continuous impact from the licenced UCL patent. The President of Global Technology and Operations International for Broadbridge, said that “ **Message Automation’s leading technology and expertise on derivatives processing models**” was the key driver behind this acquisition, and acquiring this technology has “helped Broadridge establish a comprehensive suite of capabilities across asset classes globally” \( **S7**\). 

 The General Manager, BRMA Head of Capital Markets Data & Regulatory Solutions, Broadridge Financial Solutions stated, “Xlinkit, or as we describe it ‘Message Automation Validator’ remains an intrinsic part of our software platform. It is one of the four core engines we use in all of our business solutions, and is used for much more than just its original purpose of FpML validation, it is the decisioning engine that our orchestration engine uses for \[applying\] routing rules” \( **S8**\). Through Broadridge Financials, he said, xlinkit “is now in use by **over 50 financial institutions** globally for various business purposes” \( **S8**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 111 

 Research by the Stroke Research Team has improved how psychological support is provided to people after a stroke. This work highlighted the substantial psychological needs post\-stroke such as depression, anxiety and emotionalism. More than half of stroke survivors experience disabling psychological problems; 7 million worldwide and 33,000\+ in the UK annually. The Stroke Team have revolutionised the assessment and management of these patients by developing reliable mood screening tools, enabling and expediting intervention and support. Motivational interviewing, an existing talk\-based therapy, was specifically adapted for stroke survivors and is now recommended in national and international guidelines. The research has created new collaborations between stroke teams and psychological services and the Stroke Team have developed new ways of training staff to ensure they have the correct skills to provide tailored quality care. The management of psychological problems after stroke has been transformed with new therapies and changes to prescribing practice. The use of fluoxetine, a commonly prescribed anti\-depressant has been reduced following the Stroke Team’s research, which showed increased frequency of bone fractures, negative impacting patients’ well\-being. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prior to the Stroke Team’s research there was a lack of good\-quality evidence to prevent and treat psychological problems following stroke; therefore, psychological care fell below recognised standards. 

 Half of stroke survivors will experience psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, emotionalism and fatigue.  The Stroke Team’s systematic reviews showed that depression affects half of stroke survivors in the first year, with one\-third affected at any time following a stroke, and a quarter of stroke survivors experience anxiety.  These psychological problems are associated with poorer outcomes, negatively impacting patients’ recovery. 

 In order to improve recovery, simple, cost\-effective methods are required to improve the identification and management of psychological problems. In terms of identification, the Stroke Team developed the Signs of Depression Scale \(SODS\) screening tool and have shown the SODS and the one\-item version of the Yale\-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale \(“Do you often feel sad or depressed?”\); are reliable for detecting depression in patients following stroke. 

 In terms of management, the Stroke Team’s research highlighted significant gaps in the evidence supporting the management of psychological problems in stroke survivors.  The Stroke Team’s contribution to Cochrane systematic reviews on depression \[1, 2\], anxiety and emotionalism showed a need for good\-quality evidence for psychological problems after stroke. The systematic review of interventions for preventing depression found the first talk\-based psychological intervention to show a positive outcome was the Stroke Team’s Motivational Interviewing study.  Motivational interviewing helps prevent depression, and potentially reduce death, after stroke. 

 The Stroke Team conducted a single\-centre randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) of motivational interviewing \(2007\) \[3, 6\], a talk\-based psychological therapy, which was adapted from its traditional use in behaviour change, to support psychological adjustment after stroke. This research is one of only two studies of motivational interviewing in managing depression in stroke patients.  This RCT showed that people who received motivational interviewing in addition to their usual care, early after stroke, were significantly less likely to have depression up to a year after stroke, compared to people who received usual care alone, which generally included no psychological therapy. Receiving motivational interviewing was also associated with fewer deaths: for every 12 people receiving the motivational interviewing intervention, 1 person was less likely to die \[6\]. A subsequent feasibility study \(2012\-2013\) \[4\], part\-funded by the Northern Stroke Fund, showed that clinical NHS staff were able to deliver motivational interviewing. These results have informed the COnfirming the Mechanism of Motivational Interviewing Therapy after Stroke \(COMMITS\) study which is now recruiting 1200 participants across 15 UK sites. 

 Multicentre international randomised controlled trials \(involving 5,907 participants\) did not support the routine antidepressant \(fluoxetine\) either for the prevention of post\-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function, but found their use increased the risk of bone fractures \(1.4% absolute excess risk\) in patients. \[5\] 

 <ins> **Improving care through staff training and service organisation**</ins> 

 The Stroke Research Team at the University of Central Lancashire is the UK’s only nurse\-led stroke research unit.  Since 2002, the Stroke Team have worked closely with national and international partners to improve care and education standards. In the ADOPTS study \(2015\-2017\) \(Accelerating Delivery of Psychological Therapies after   Stroke\) funded by the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care North West Coast, the Stroke Team developed and implemented an evidence\-based pathway of psychological support, incorporating cross\-service collaboration and training for staff. There was evidence for increased psychological support for patients by 6\-months post\-stroke following implementation of the pathway. Whilst ADOPTS was not powered to detect a change in mood scores between the intervention and control groups, there was a trend towards less depression in the intervention group.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Across the world, 20 million people including 100,000 in the UK, will experience a stroke annually, of whom two\-thirds will survive. One in three stroke survivors experience depression, particularly within the first year, and this increases cardiovascular\-related morbidity and mortality, whilst also contributing to further NHS costs. Emotional difficulties directly and indirectly reduce quality\-of\-life for the patient by hindering post\-stroke activities like taking medication, engaging in rehabilitation, maintaining social networks, and returning to work. Improving psychological care after stroke enhances patients’ health and quality\-of\-life and reduces burden on NHS services. 

 <ins> **Impact on practice**</ins> 

 The Stroke Team validated two screening tools, SODS and Yale\-Brown Obsessive\-Compulsive Scale, to reliably detect depression in patients following stroke. This validation has led to greater screening for depression amongst stroke survivors.  These screening tools have now been implemented in clinical stroke pathways by numerous NHS stroke services including Cornwall, Dartford, Manchester, Lancashire, London and Glasgow. They are also used in the Netherlands and in Germany \[D\]. 

 The Royal College of Physicians National Clinical Guideline for Stroke now recommend that **“People with or at risk of depression or anxiety after stroke should be offered brief psychological interventions such as motivational interviewing…before considering antidepressant medication”** \[A\]  The Australian Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Management, which is also used in New Zealand, similarly recommend that **“…psychological strategies \(e.g. problem solving, motivational interviewing\) may be used to prevent depression.”** \[B\] 

 The Stroke Team’s research, as one of the only sources of evidence on motivational interviewing managing depression after stroke, is increasingly being used in practice and in guidelines.  Motivational interviewing training and principles are now being widely implemented by and for stroke staff. NHS stroke services in Hereford, Cornwall, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow have implemented the training.  Internationally it is found in online training by the Stroke Foundation in Australia, by stroke nurses in the Netherlands and in professional stroke education in the Heart and Stroke Foundation in Canada \[D\]. 

 By adapting motivational interviewing from its original use in behaviour change to adjustment, the clinical impact was extended beyond stroke. For example, the Stroke Team were approached by HIV nurses in Atlanta, USA to provide training in motivational interviewing and guidance into incorporating motivational interviewing within their consultations. They have appreciated Stroke Team’s contribution, stating: **“We and our study participants have truly benefitted from your expertise and input into our motivational adjustment intervention.”** \[J\] 

 The ADOPTS trial has improved care through staff training and the organisation of services. An evidence\-based pathway was developed that enhanced access to psychological support following stroke. The implementation of this pathway resulted in fostering collaborative working between multidisciplinary staff in stroke and generic mental health services, such as Improving Access to Psychological Therapies \(IAPT\), who were previously seen and felt to be working in silos. Working alongside these services to support the adoption of best practice the research resulted in an increased awareness, better networking and peer\-support between the services which previously had minimal collaboration. These new collaborations stimulated the creation of innovative solutions for the provision of psychological support post\-stroke. As one IAPT psychological therapist reported **“I bumped into someone from the stroke team who I met through ADOPTS and we agreed to meet up and try to help each other.”** \[I\] A stroke occupational therapist said: **“I asked \[IAPT\] if they could come and talk about mental health, and obviously stroke\-related, and how we could help patients.”** \[I\] This innovative model has now been widely employed across north\-west England, resulting in increased awareness and collaboration resulting in ADOPTS becoming a shortlisted finalist for the North West Coast Research and Innovation Awards. 

 <ins> **Impact on practitioners**</ins> 

 Training developed and implemented as part of the ADOPTS research, underpinned by the screening and interventions research, has increased the knowledge and skills among stroke and IAPT teams in identifying and managing psychological problems after stroke. The training improved stroke teams’ psychological awareness, IAPT teams’ stroke awareness and facilitated better psychological support for stroke survivors. Training was initially delivered to 152 staff across six NHS Trusts \(Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust\). The training was well received by participants with one IAPT practitioner stating: **“In the training, thinking about the way we communicate… I found \[it\] really useful… to adapt our therapies.”** Some stroke services and psychological services have cascaded the training, extending its reach beyond the staff trained within ADOPTS. A stroke senior occupational therapist said, **“I’ve incorporated it into in\-service training for therapy staff, because things around psychological impact weren’t really there, and the feedback’s been really positive.”** The training has since been endorsed by the UK Stroke Forum for Education and Training which ensures high quality and relevant training for stroke practitioners and is accessible across the UK. Following ADOPTS, we have been invited to teach on the IAPT course around long\-term stroke recovery conditions. Training has also been delivered in areas beyond those included in the study in Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and North West Boroughs Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, increasing the knowledge and skills of IAPT staff across the North West region. 

 <ins> **Impact on patients**</ins> 

 There have been national and international implementations of the work on mood screening, motivational interviewing therapy and antidepressants. This has resulted in substantial impacts on patient care and survival after stroke. Patients who received motivational interviewing in the Stroke Team’s research said they found it beneficial: **“It helps me get things clearer in my mind… stops me sitting and worrying on things,”** While another patient stated **“It’s been worthwhile talking to someone… it’s been great just talking through things because you can talk with family but they don’t understand certain things.”** \[I\] 

 Stroke and IAPT staff felt that stroke survivors, over 1500 per year across the services in which ADOPTS was implemented, benefited from the model. One stroke occupational therapist stated that **“The training brought their \[patients\] psychological wellbeing to the forefront … they’re hopefully getting more holistic care.”** This is corroborated by a stroke survivor who took part in the study and who benefited from an IAPT referral resulting in improved coping methods and an increase in confidence: **“I ended up being referred to Mindsmatter, then attending several group sessions…I know the sessions were a benefit to me. They have helped me in developing my coping methods… I now have more confidence and acceptance of what I can achieve since my stroke.”** \[I\] 

 **Reducing the use of fluoxetine** 

 The FOCUS study showed a 1.4% absolute excess risk of bone fractures with the prescription of fluoxetine.  This has led to the antidepressant, which was commonly used to manage post stroke depression, being prescribed less. The study has been cited in American and Canadian clinical guidelines for stroke management to guide practitioners on the use of antidepressants after stroke \[F, G\]. The guidelines state that the antidepressant fluoxetine does not have an effect on functional recovery.  The use of the antidepressant fluoxetine is now increasingly avoided due to  evidence from the Stroke Team’s research showing its use increases the risk of adverse effects and alternative antidepressants are now considered in the first instance \[H\].

 Dr. Brian Klaas's research, consultancy, and briefings for global policymakers have led to improved election quality and security in the UK and in Ukraine, substantial public discourse around threats to democracy \(particularly in the United States\), NATO’s establishment of a semi\-permanent tracking capability that prepares for and seeks to mitigate the risks of conflict related to water scarcity in the Middle East and North Africa, and more pressure on Madagascar’s government to improve human rights. Klaas’s research has shaped political dialogue about democracy with global reach through over 500 media interviews since joining UCL in 2018, including appearances on major international news outlets in the UK and USA, and as a result of his weekly column in *The Washington Post,* which has over 2,000,000 digital subscribers.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Brian Klaas’s research focuses on issues related to authoritarianism and the ways in which it either prevents democracy from taking root or uproots existing democracies. His research combines quantitative analysis with elite interviews conducted during field work in a variety of countries, such as Madagascar, Zambia, Thailand, Côte d’Ivoire, Tunisia, Belarus, and the United States. “Five New Ways to Rig an Election and Ten Ways to Stop It” \( **R1**\) examines new and innovative ways \(particularly in the digital age\) that authoritarian regimes rig elections—in order to win and to create a false veneer of international legitimacy. The research for this new chapter for the paperback edition of *How to Rig an Election*, co\-authored with Nic Cheeseman, was carried out after Klaas joined UCL as lecturer in global politics within the School of European Language, Culture, and Society \( **SELCS**\) in September 2018, an appointment made as part of the School’s expansion of research into languages and cultures beyond Europe, and to address issues of global reach and importance through interdisciplinary approaches. It \( **R1**\) provides a substantial contribution to the political science literature by demonstrating how despots across the globe harness new technologies \(including social media ventures like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter\) to consolidate their power. This is an important correction to the earlier scholarly and public consensus that social media would primarily be used to empower citizens against authoritarian regimes. Furthermore, the chapter explores the ways in which authoritarian leaders will benefit from emerging technologies, like machine learning\-assisted “deep fakes,” which allow unscrupulous actors to create fake videos of world leaders appearing to make statements that they never actually said. The new chapter draws on several case studies, including elections in India, Brazil, Ukraine, and the United States, to demonstrate precisely how these innovative tactics operate in practice. It  represents an important addition to scholarship by Klaas related to the rise of authoritarianism, the dangers of political violence around elections, the authoritarian\-style impulses of new populists like President Donald Trump, and the ways in which blurring the line between fact and fiction can pose a severe threat to fragile democracies. 

 Klaas’s research has also examined political exclusion in Africa, based on field research undertaken in Côte d’Ivoire. He argues in \( **R2**\) that the political history of Africa is defined by political exclusion.  Klaas shows that political exclusion in authoritarian and semi\-authoritarian regimes substantially increases the likelihood of future coups d’état, civil wars, and other forms of destabilizing conflict and violence. 

 In 2020 Klaas co\-authored a private brief for the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity \( **TCEI**\) highlighting key security threats in Ukraine’s elections \( **R3**\).  The report identified a series of cyber vulnerabilities that could be exploited by foreign actors along with a series of recommendations for shoring up election security in Ukraine. 

 The fourth piece of underpinning research is an unpublished report that Klaas co\-authored for Amnesty International about the ways in which Chinese investment in Madagascar was contributing serious human rights abuses \( **R4**\). The work was commissioned so that Amnesty could focus its lobbying efforts and international pressure campaign in the areas of greatest need. The report proposed strategies that could help reform its extractive industries sector to reduce child labour, to reduce illegal trafficking, and to lower corruption tied to mining.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Authoritarian leaders who agree to hold elections are generally able to remain in power longer than autocrats who refuse to allow the populace to vote. Such authoritarian regimes undermine the electoral process through pseudo\-democratic strategies to guarantee victory for themselves. Klaas’s research has led to changes in international policy to improve election quality and security, a renewed push for human rights lobbying in one of the world’s poorest countries, and increased public understanding while generating significant debate about the ongoing decline of global democracy. 

 **Influencing global policymakers in senior government positions and improving election quality and security** 

 Klaas has directly advised a series of high\-profile international organizations about authoritarianism and elections, including NATO, the UK Foreign Office, and the UK Cabinet Office. His research into rigged elections \( **R1**\), political exclusion in Africa \( **R2**\), election security in vulnerable democracies \( **R3**\), and authoritarian human rights abuses \( **R4**\) underpins his policy engagement with these groups. His research has led to policy changes in several instances. 

 In May 2019, Klaas organized and gave the keynote address at a NATO conference in Naples, Italy about the potential consequences of climate change on the Middle East and North Africa. Drawing on \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\), he spoke about challenges posed by authoritarian governments related to water scarcity along with exclusionary politics and the scramble for resources. As a result, NATO established a semi\-permanent tracking capability that prepares for and seeks to mitigate the risks of conflict related to water scarcity in the region. NATO’s Allied Command Transformation attests that Klaas’s research led to NATO Joint Force Command\-Naples and NATO Strategic Direction South establishing the Open Perspectives Exchange Network \( **OPEN**\) Seminar, a working group that “brings together a diverse group of Tunisian experts to share their expertise and share perspectives. Dr. Klaas was directly responsible for the success of this Seminar \[… and\] his work with OPEN was a catalyst that helped propel OPEN from experiment to capability” \( **A**\). They state that Klaas’s “work on Tunisia enabled NATO Strategic Direction South to overcome their immediate challenge of connecting and sharing with non\-military actors, thereby providing a powerful win to the fledgling organization” and “facilitated the first information exchange from the Hub” \( **A**\). 

 Klaas conducted two private and confidential briefings in February and July 2020 with senior leadership of the UK Foreign Office about American political polarization and the Trump administration, drawing on his research for \( **R1**\) and \( **R3**\) on authoritarian populism and Trump’s repeated claims that the 2020 American elections would be “rigged.” FCO officials circulated these briefings to shape the UK Foreign Office’s 2020 long\-term vision, which guides staff thinking about the major sources of geopolitical risk over the longer term. FCO policy precludes providing any attribution for shifts in British foreign policy to outside advising, but the FCO attests that Klaas’s “contributions have provoked thought and discussion among colleagues here” and noted the unusually high number of top\-level directors who attended the two briefings \( **B**\). 

 \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] 

 An invitation to advise government officials and other policymakers at Wilton Park, an executive agency of the UK’s Foreign Office, arose from Klaas’s *Washington Post* article on the threat of “deep fake” videos to democracy \(14 May 2019, 130,121 unique page views by June 2019\) based on \( **R1**\) \( **D**\). Klaas conducted a briefing at Wilton Park on 8 April 2019 and this expert testimonial formed part of a formal report compiled by Wilton Park staff. The report included specific recommendations for the UK government that draw on his research \( **R1**\), such as “Governments should consider how to confront the problem of ‘deep fake’ videos \(convincing false videos of world leaders\) and explore in depth whether influence operations are likely to become bolder, and escalate in the lead up to polling day” \( **E**\). In addition, Klaas has similarly advised the European Union, the Italian Foreign Ministry and the UK Department of International Trade. 

 In July 2019, Klaas co\-authored a private report \( **R3**\) for the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity about potential forms of manipulation of Ukraine’s elections. The **TCEI** is a hugely influential international body made up of fourteen members, including two former presidents, a former US secretary of state, a former US secretary of homeland security, and a former Secretary General of NATO. The report was used as the basis for a three\-day conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, in September 2019. The conference aimed to put pressure on both Ukraine’s government and Western governments to help protect Ukraine’s fledgling democracy \( **F**\). The Chancellor's Professor, Carleton University, who oversaw the report with TCEI, confirms that it is “a very useful and informative report \[…\] that has gained widespread attention and been read by policymakers here in Canada”. They noted that it has “broad relevance to the integrity of elections in other countries and not just Europe” and “It is my understanding from those members of the Commission that I know that the paper was important to their work and deliberations” \( **F**\). 

 In April 2020, Klaas co\-authored a private report \( **R4**\) about human rights abuses in Madagascar linked to Chinese investment on the island for Amnesty International, one of the premier human rights lobbying organizations in the world. The Strategy Manager at Amnesty wrote that “Brian and David’s scoping study on the human rights impact of Chinese investment and activities in Madagascar helped Amnesty to identify the issues on which, and ways in which, we could contribute to positive change.” They attested that the report provided a useful framework for focusing their strategy to pressure Madagascar into cracking down on human rights abusers \( **G**\). 

 Klaas also gave a high\-profile keynote lecture about *How to Rig an Election* \( **R1**\) at the India Today Conclave in Mumbai \(21 September 2019\). The Head of the Election Commission of India attended the event and it created a significant public debate in India, because President Modi had claimed that Indian election machines cannot be hacked. Klaas refuted that false claim, creating significant media coverage in major Indian newspapers, including features in *India Today*’s digital publication, its print magazine, and a story in *Business News*, a top Indian economics press outlet \( **H**\). Klaas’s lecture has been viewed 11,966 times on YouTube and received 131 comments \( **H**\). 

 **Shaping public political dialogue about democracy through media engagement** 

 As an expert political commentator, Klaas has conducted over 500 media interviews since joining UCL in 2018. Regular appearances on high\-profile television and radio programmes in the UK and USA to talk about global politics have enabled informed public participation in specialised political debate across traditional and social media, a key part of effective democratic process. 

 Klaas has appeared 9 times on *The* *Today Programme* on BBC Radio 4, which has roughly 1,000,000 listeners per day, as well as providing expert analysis for other programmes. As a featured guest on *More or Less: Behind the Stats* on 15 August 2020, Klaas drew on \( **R1**\) to discuss election rigging in Belarus. *More or Less* is broadcast to hundreds of thousands of listeners on Radio 4 and is consistently in the top 25 most downloaded podcasts in Britain. He also was a guest speaking about digital election campaigns on the BBC Radio 2 Jeremy Vine programme on 13 August 2019 which has approximately 7,420,000 listeners per week. He has appeared four times on BBC Newsnight, for example drawing on his research on the politics of exclusion \( **R2**\) to discuss how America’s exclusionary immigration policy could create civil strife \(5 June 2019, \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\]\) \( **I**\). 

 Klaas appears regularly on MSNBC, including 11 appearances on morning news programme *Morning Joe* \(1,100,000 viewers average\) and 12 appearances on political talk ‘ *The Last Word* with Lawrence O’Donnell’ \(2,570,000 viewers average\). These appearances frequently generate significant public debate. For example, Klaas argued in a 12 March 2020 MSNBC appearance that Donald Trump’s response to coronavirus replicated the same types of disinformation as the authoritarian Soviet Union’s botched response to the Chernobyl catastrophe. \#TrumpsChernobyl was one of the top trending Twitter topics that day indicating how Klaas shaped global conversations; the clip was viewed by 145,000 people and the phrase was referenced in *The New York Times*, *The Guardian*, and on Sean Hannity’s Fox News primetime show among other media outlets \( **D**, **I**\). 

 Klaas’s weekly column \(since 2018\) for *The Washington Post* is read by tens of thousands of people per week. In 2020, his column received an average of 80,062 unique page views, while the average for Washington Post columns is 52,527 unique page views \( **D**\). Additionally, many of his columns have appeared in print, for which *The Washington Post* has more than 350,000 print subscribers. Many of his columns spark high profile public debate. For example, US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren shared on Twitter his 12 July 2019 column about how American presidents reward campaign donors with prestigious diplomatic posts. Warren, citing the column, again pledged not to appoint ambassadors who were also donors to her campaign \( **D**, **J**\). A column on April 22, 2020, comparing British media to Fox News in the United States, generated 1,200 unique comments on the Washington Post page, along with 6,400 retweets on Twitter, and 659 comments on the Washington Post Facebook page \( **D**, **J**\). Another column \(September 2, 2020\) about Trump’s campaign strategy to appeal to white suburban voters in the Midwest, was shared on Twitter by Dean Phillips, a member of the US Congress, who said: “An insightful and powerful piece by Brian Klaas…The strategy of hate and division being employed by Trump will only bring our community together.” \( **D, J**\) 

 Klaas’s podcast series, ‘Power Corrupts’, has been downloaded 1,670,000 times \(in 207 separate countries/territories, with at least 1,000 downloads in 48 separate countries\) since being launched in May 2019. Episodes introduce and analyse major topics including election rigging, smuggling, conspiracy theories and assassinations drawing on Klaas’s research expertise. The first episode, ‘How to rig an election’, based on \( **R1**\), has been downloaded 90,000 times \( **I**\). The podcast led to the team leader for Governance, Conflict, Inclusion, and Humanitarian research at the UK Department for International Development \( **DFID**\), approaching Klaas directly and this has sparked discussions to commission an episode about corruption in public procurement in collaboration with the UK Department for International Development. The podcast was awarded the Bronze Award for “Smartest Podcast of 2020” by the British Podcast Awards, beating finalists from the BBC and *The Times* \( **I**\). 

 Klaas’s large—and influential—Twitter following of 246,500 people \(November 2020\) includes 7 US Senators \(out of 100\), dozens of members of the United States House of Representatives, and members of parliament from the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Ireland. His tweets are widely shared and engaged with, leading to between 25, 000,000 and 65,000,000 impressions per month \(a measure of how many Twitter users had a tweet by Klaas show up in their Twitter feed\). In July 2020, a single tweet \(about comparative government responses to the coronavirus pandemic\) was seen by 22,000,000 people, was retweeted 109,091 times and liked by 278,310 unique accounts. It generated 1,840 comments on Klaas’s tweet itself, and tens of thousands of additional comments when others shared it \( **J**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our collaborative research revealed the negative effects of the current UK Counter terrorism legislation on education and challenged stakeholders’ understanding of how the Prevent Strategy \(PS\) and the promotion of Fundamental British values \(FBV\) in educational settings has been counterproductive – stigmatising and silencing the Muslim community and fuelling dangerous nationalistic and racist attitudes. The research influenced teacher educators, student and classroom teachers to re appraise and/or change established thought, policy and practice in regards to FBV/PS. A review commissioned by an independent government committee has utilised the research to make recommendations that FBV/PS is divisive and counter\-productive and that the teaching of FBVs in school should be reviewed. Finally, community and County Council leaders have utilised the research to consider how PS and FBV might not serve the best interests of the communities they serve. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Context:** Fundamental British Values \(FBV\) were first set out in the government’s Prevent Strategy \(PS\) in 2011, and include the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. Between 2011 and 2014, schools were required to ‘respect’ these values, but, since 2014, must now have a clear strategy for embedding these values and demonstrating how their work with pupils has been effective in doing so. Furthermore, the requirement “not to undermine FBV” has become part of the Teachers’ Standards \(DfE, 2012\) slipping silently and seemingly unchallenged from the PS. 

 **Research Programme:** Elton\-Chalcraft published R1 in 2009, an empirical, child\-centred study examining children’s views of cultural diversity and efforts to counter racism in schools. From 2012 to 2018 a group of five researchers from four Universities utilised this research \(R1\) to investigate the incorporation of FBV into educational policy and standards. Elton\-Chalcraft, Lander \(Leeds Beckett\) and Revell \(Canterbury Christ Church\) invited early career researchers Warner \(Cumbria\) and Whitworth \(Middlesex\) to assist with data collection in a collaborative project designed to evaluate teacher and student teacher responses to FBV/PS \(R2\). Elton\-Chalcraft subsequently commissioned colleagues to co\-author chapters in a widely used teacher education text book \(R4\) and in an international handbook \(R3\). The research received esteem through keynotes at Limerick and Edge Hill University and a co\-authored blog for British Educational Research Association \(BERA\). 

 **Findings:** R1 demonstrated how nine and ten year olds have internalized the prevailing western mind\-set, regardless of ethnicity, and that this can be racist in nature. R2 explored this further within policy by problematizing the Teachers’ Standards \(DfE, 2012\) requirement to promote FBV in initial teacher education in England; interviewing 20 teachers and surveying 450 student teachers. R2 uncovered misconceptions, fear and dysconscious racism owing to a lack of nuanced training for pre\-service and in\-service teachers. R3 examined data from 150 students, and demonstrated that despite a normative attachment to notions of professional objectivity and political detachment in the classroom, most student teachers interpreted their new duties as legitimate and were uncritical of legislation and policy that expects them to play an overtly political role in schools. 

 We deduced that the concept of FBV is unchallenged and its racialising implications are unrecognized by most teachers. R2 also revealed that the government’s directive to promote FBV within a statutory document that regulates the teacher education is a politicization of the profession by the State, thus implying that teachers are State instruments of surveillance. R4 analysed these findings for use by student teachers. 

 Ultimately, the research demonstrated how FBV/PS creates an ‘us’ and ‘them’ binary; an assertion of *‘our’* British values; and a need for ‘ *them*’ to assimilate into British society. This consequentially silences marginalised voices, creates a fearful and intolerant \(often Islamophobic\) environment ultimately counter to the intended aim. This outcome is additionally enforced within the ‘hidden curriculum’, a side effect of schooling: "" *\[lessons\] which are learned but not openly intended*"" \(Valence 1973/2014\). This is to say that teachers, outside the formal curriculum, through their rapport with learners, displays and body language, can reinforce ‘us’ and ‘them’ binaries that promote white, Western outlooks at the expense of other perspectives.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact 1: Challenging established norms and modes of thought for teacher educators** 

 Our research has provided evidence to empower and enable teacher educators to more effectively instruct trainee teachers to navigate FBV within a regulatory environment whilst maintaining independence and debate. We have generated attitudinal change in educational professionals, some of whom initially welcomed the Prevent Strategy \(PS\) and uncritically promoted Fundamental British Values \(FBV\). Educational professionals have had their ‘eyes opened’ \(S1\) to discriminatory practice and, as a result, changed their practice. 

 Through engagement with the FBV research, Professor Putwain \(Liverpool John Moores\) invited Elton\-Chalcraft to present research at a workshop for schoolteachers, academics and teacher educators \(S1\). The twelve attending teacher educators expressed how our research provided evidence to support the stance they wanted to take in their Initial Teacher Education \(ITE\) sessions \(S2\). Formerly, they were hesitant about communicating contradictory messages to students when attempting to adhere to PS duty and 2012 Teaching Standards requirements. However, the research benefited these teacher educators by giving them the confidence to voice their mistrust in the Prevent policy, whilst not undermining their university’s compliance to governmental directives.  One teacher educator \(S3\) utilised the research as a key reference point for dialogue on best practice and policy at professional bodies including the British Educational Research Association, Universities Council for the Education of Teachers, and American Educational Research Association. Thus our research has challenged conventional wisdom of uncritical adherence to governmental policy in ITE practice, in the context of FBV. 

 Presentation of the research at this workshop stimulated a change in mindset, leading delegates to question their assumptions and approach to professional practice. For example: “ *\[the research\]* *prompted a renewed understanding of the critical multiculturalist stance”* \(S2\); and “ *has challenged me to separate out the attitudes people have towards FBV… I will encourage students to engage in deeper thinking”* \(S2\). The research challenged teacher educators to engage with students differently, and to see the need to create critical spaces and identify experts to critique the blanket promotion of FBVs, supporting teachers to adapt to these cultural values. 

 A Teacher Educator \(S3\) said that his teaching had been impacted by R2, creating space for consciously opening up and improving discussions and debate on sensitive areas *.* A Dean of Education \(S4\) further stated that “ *\[the\]* *research has influenced student teachers by altering their views and informing their practice as professional educators, and prompting them to consider delivery of the curriculum in relation to Fundamental British Values and the Prevent Strategy*… *\[the\] research is enormously important in terms of raising \(student\) teacher’s awareness of the complexities of radicalisation and extremism as it is too often simplified”.* These teacher education comments demonstrate how the research has altered their views and informed their practice in their professional educational contexts. Teacher educators also believed Prevent to cause instances of Islamophobia \(suggested in our research findings\) 

 **Impact 2: Improving awareness of FBV and more inclusive practices amongst school teachers and school pupils** 

 Our research has changed perceptions about the extent to which FBV is effective in realising the intended aims of PS; and provided teachers with new perspectives on how to implement PS more effectively. For example, one teacher stated: “ *I now have a clearer understanding of the ‘far right’ and also how FBV’s are closely linked to Prevent, so the seminar discussing the research has deepened my understanding and informed my professional practice”* \(S2\). Three teachers felt that they did not have the confidence to embed this in the curriculum because of uncertainty around the suitability of FBV, and felt emboldened after the workshop, saying the research had “ *altered their perception of what effective multicultural education should look like”.* Teachers felt the implications of the research upskilled them to consider more carefully their own professional response to promoting FBV’s; challenging them to be inclusive when promoting British values with children from different countries, races and religions. 

 Our research on the PS and how to interpret and apply this differently to reflect different cultures, helped teachers to realise they were *“not doing enough multicultural work, always doing Roald Dahl”,  rather than including examples from a range of authors outside the traditional canon. They said they had learnt from the workshop not to compare cultures or make one culture superior \(S2\). This is particularly significant in the context of the ‘hidden curriculum’ whereby teachers ‘choices’ about the language and resources they use, or the stance and approach they take, can have a significant effect on children’s perceptions of FBV/PS. 

 The research has therefore increased teacher’s understanding of how FBV/PS, can engender an ‘us’ and ‘them’ binary or ‘insider’ / ‘outsider’ stance.  This has subsequently informed their ability to make informed decisions on their professional practice for developing inclusionary practices and understanding of different cultures within an inherently white, Western, patriarchal school system and culture. Regarding changed policy or classroom practice, teachers \(S2\) expressed their intentions to adapt school policy and curriculum and to “ *think more deeply about how to follow governmental directives in a more critically aware way.”* 

 Elton\-Chalcraft additionally consulted with two teachers in Greece during a study visit in April 2019. One \(S5\) described how the research had impacted on her mind\-set; making her more aware of how the PS in Britain was similar to the Greek context where Syrian Muslim children were being victimised and silenced by the majority of Greek teachers. This teacher felt more empowered to speak to others about her work with refugees as a result of our discussions: “ *Sally's research helped me understand how the dominant group can leave out the minority group….. A part of the teaching body, either agrees with this political directive or disagrees and tries its best without a great deal of the state's support. A significant number of teachers, however, adopt these practices without realising it.”* 

 The link between Prevent and Islamophobia was also raised at the 2019 *‘Today’s Youth, Tomorrow’s Future’ Conference’* \(Chaired by the Archbishop of York\), where Elton\-Chalcraft was an invited panel member working alongside pupils from local schools. The link between Prevent and faith discrimination was confirmed by the views of teenagers, including one delegate \(a migrated Indian Sikh\) who came to realise that teachers may inadvertently silence the voices of Muslim children, resulting in their prejudicial treatment \(S6\). The individual felt empowered and reassured that academics were unveiling and challenging racism \(an aim of R2\) stating that the research *“has helped me as a migrated Indian Sikh to think about my place in British society*”, and to “ *realise how teachers are motivated to become agents of surveillance which in turn result in muting the voices of Muslim children.”* 

 **Impact 3: Informing public and political debate on the effectiveness of FBV/PS as a strategy for countering extremism** 

 A July 2019 review titled ‘Critiquing Approaches to Countering Extremism’ was commissioned for the UK Government’s ‘Commission for Countering Extremism’ \(conducted by Dr Struthers \(Warwick\) and Dr Webber \(Georgetown University\)\) and cites R2 as part of an academic analysis on the negative discourse around FBVs. The review’s conclusions state that *“the teaching of FBVs is fraught with problems and is divisive and counter\-productive. It is not doing the job that needs to be done,”* and that *“the Government is urged to abandon the obligation on schools to promote FBVs, and review this aspect of the Prevent strategy”* \(S7\). 

 More recently, we have seen members of the Labour party consider scrapping the PS, including Rebecca Long\-Bailey MP who proposed as part of her leadership campaign \(February 2020\) that: *“The Prevent programme has alienated the Muslim community, set back our freedoms and not made us safer. The evidence is clear: it’s got to go”* \(S8\). 

 The research has benefitted local authority school training and equality policies. The Strategic Policy and Scrutiny Adviser for Cumbria County Council \(S10\) has utilised the research to work with schools on dismantling inequality: *“\[the\] research has been influential on informing my attitude towards Prevent and my practice”.* Specifically, the research has been used as an evidence base to advise school leaders \(359 in Cumbria\) on discussions about British Values in the context of Black Lives Matter, and to help understanding about the processes of structural discrimination. This has ensured teachers appreciate how uncritical adherence to FBV can be counter\-productive by silencing certain groups and creating in/out groups; thus helping children to be treated equitably. More broadly the research has provided an evidence base for Cumbria County Councils 2020\-24 Equality Objectives and the mandatory e\-learning for all staff and elected members \(S10\). 

 **Impact 4: Contributing to community programmes on equality, diversity and inclusion** 

 In the context of the pandemic \(and resultant inequalities\), as well as events such as Black Lives Matter, Elton\-Chalcraft has utilised her research to engage with stakeholders across the region on issues around equality and diversity. This has led to the research influencing the thinking and practice of community leaders. 

 For example the High Sherriff \(S9\) of Carlisle stated: “ *Your research has been influential on my thinking and practice as I conducted my role as High Sheriff of Cumbria 2019/20. That is in addition to my \(many years of\) work as a Magistrate.  I am also active on numerous Boards and Councils where I often mention specific bits of your work. Most recently, I have drawn on the research in my equality, diversity and inclusion work across the county.”*  S9 also stated: “ *I’ve spoken about you to other professionals and non\-professionals alike because I think there is a real place for your knowledgeable voice in our really confused, sometimes dysfunctional society”.* 

 This led to Elton\-Chalcraft providing a keynote at the Race2B BAME Conference \(funded by the Cumbria Community Foundation\), which “ *resulted in the development of a wide ranging group involving the Police, Anti\-Racist Groups, and both Carlisle and Cumbria County Council’s actively investigating structural reform and activities to make Cumbria more inclusive”* \(S9\) *.* Subsequently, Elton\-Chalcraft co\-founded the Cumbria Race Equality Network with the former High Sherriff \(S9\), Chair of Cumbria Multicultural Society, Chair of Anti\-Racist Cumbria, Strategic Policy and Scrutiny Advisor for Cumbria County Council \(S10\), and representatives from the Police. The networks mission is to work collaboratively towards eliminating racism. 

 Finally, Elton\-Chalcraft jointly facilitated Carlisle’s first Culture Bazaar which saw 100 pupils from 4 primary schools take part in arts and crafts, food tasting, dancing and story\-telling \(S11\). Organised with Multicultural Cumbria \(MCC\) on the Carlisle campus, the Bazaar promoted equality and respect. MCC’s Chief Officer said: “ *I wasn't sure how the mini Culture Bazaar would be in this new environment but, as the schools came in, any anxiety disappeared with their smiley excited faces – and that was just the teachers and university student volunteers. There was such a positive vibe and that came from everyone involved. We hope to do more of this in the future with the University of Cumbria. The start of something big, determined and focussed. It was an all\-round wonderful experience.”* \(S11\). Engagement with the event and the research also raised awareness about diversity in Cumbria amongst around 25 first\-year student teachers and a cohort in the final year of their Education Studies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research in language policy and planning undertaken at Bangor University has significantly developed the understanding of language use and language transmission in relation to Welsh, informing policy and practice across a range of sectors including Welsh Government, Education, Third Sector, Healthcare and Civil Society. There has been notable impact on key Welsh Government language policy areas including community language usage and intergenerational language transmission where research findings have directed how Welsh Government and the office of the Welsh Language Commissioner approach the ongoing revitalisation of the Welsh language as outlined in the current Welsh language strategy, *Cymraeg 2050*. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Focussing on the need to recognise the vital importance of micro\-level interactions in the drive to ensure sustainable regeneration of the Welsh language, research undertaken by Hodges and Prys has centred on the fundamental aspects of daily life where language choices and language usage are habit\-forming. Their research has centred on two key areas: **Civil Society** and **Education / Language Transmission**. 

#####  Civil Society 

 Research at Bangor University has analysed Welsh language use within civil society with an emphasis on understanding how Welsh speakers use Welsh and the barriers that affect language usage within communities \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.a, 3b\]. This enhanced understanding is essential in terms of implementing effective language planning strategies to create sustainable Welsh language communities and revitalise communities that need specific language resurgence. Research findings called for increased promotion of language use within informal settings, such as daily community interactions \(i.e., shopping, accessing healthcare services\), and for more effective planning and multi\-agency partnership between Welsh Government \(WG\) and civil society stakeholders when facilitating Welsh language use within formally organised community activities. Research also emphasised the lack of choice in terms of language in community activities and how this could have a negative effect on usage and attitudes towards Welsh \[3.1, 3.a\]. Usage of the Welsh language within the voluntary sector has often been an under\-reported field of study, despite being earmarked by WG and other stakeholders as a crucial area in which to provide services through the medium of Welsh \(in accordance with the Welsh Language \(Wales\) Measure 2011\). Research into language use in the voluntary sector outlined the impact of language on care and called for Welsh speaking staff / volunteers to provide Welsh\-medium services for vulnerable service users. The study highlighted the challenges faced by the voluntary sector in recruiting Welsh speaking volunteers \[3.b\] and its impact on services for vulnerable service users \[3.2\]. 

#####  Education / Language Transmission 

 Research also explored the role of bilingualism \[3.5 \- 3.6\] and education within the language revitalisation agenda in Wales, specifically early years language transmission and the language usage of new Welsh speakers \[3.3, 3.4\]. Research found that there were gaps in early years Welsh medium provision for parents with young children who wished to use and develop their use of Welsh within formal activities \[3.1\]. The study highlighted that parents were not always aware of this provision or of the progression routes through various WG programmes. The importance of non\-Welsh speaking parental incentives in choosing Welsh\-medium immersion education for their children was highlighted with cultural reasons \(identity; belonging\) identified as the main incentive. Research maintained that cultural incentives provide a positive language planning platform from which to reverse language shift and revealed the obstacles faced by new Welsh speakers using Welsh beyond education, such as lack of confidence, competence and themes related to language ownership and speaker authenticity \[3.4\]. Other language use spheres, such as the community and the workplace, are crucial in providing key language progression routes for new speakers of Welsh and thus contributing to language revitalisation. Responding to these language planning needs, innovative e\-resources were created by Prys and Hodges in order to maximise language progression in the educational sphere.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Over the last ten years, research by Hodges and Prys has had demonstrable impact across a range of sectors at local and national level including Government Policy, Education, Third Sector, Healthcare and Civil Society. The impact has been affected through influencing policy and practice in three key, interrelated areas: **Welsh Government \(WG\) Language Policy and Projects**; the work of the **Welsh Language Commissioner \(WLC\)**; and the field of **Language Promotion and Education**. 

#####  Welsh Government Language Policy and Projects 

 Research has significantly influenced WG priorities in the area of language planning as attested by Deputy Chief Social Research Officer, WG: “Understanding the factors that influence the use of Welsh in informal settings and at community level is a key element of the Welsh Government’s work in relation to promoting the use of Welsh. Research undertaken by Dr Cynog Prys and Dr Rhian Hodges has contributed to the evidence base that is available to us, as we increase this understanding” \[5.1\]. Citing the evaluative analysis undertaken by Hodges and Prys into the efficacy of WG’s flagship language strategy, *A Living Language: A Language for Living* \(2012 \- 2017\), the WG has changed its strategic priorities within the current WG language strategy, *Cymraeg 2050*, to focus efforts on community Welsh language use by prioritising key language use domains \[5.2\]. In particular, the strategy calls for further opportunities for teenagers and young adults to use Welsh socially, as highlighted in *Welsh Language Use in the Community* for which Hodges and Prys provided expert input \[5.3\].  The strategy also responds to the research finding that fluent Welsh speakers tend to switch to English when speaking to Welsh learners and new Welsh speakers. Based on the research, WG outlined their aim of embedding “positive language use practices supported by formal and informal opportunities to use Welsh socially” \[5.2\]. Research findings were also referenced by WG in its Welsh language strategy *A living Language: A language for Living \- Moving Forward* \[5.4\]. Following recommendations surfaced by Prys in *Exploring Welsh speakers’ language use in their daily lives* \(S4C, BBC Cymru Wales, WG, 2013\) \[5.5\], the WG developed the marketing campaign ‘Pethau Bychain’ \(Little Things\) to influence daily linguistic behaviour and norms. Additionally, this research contributed to the WG policy of providing an active offer of Welsh language services within the health and social care sector as outlined in the WG’s Strategic Framework for Welsh Language Services in Health, Social Services and Social Care, *More than just words* \(WG, 2019\). The research is also referred to within a key policy consultation document *National policy on Welsh language transmission and use in families* \(WG, 2020\). In addition, Hodges and Prys have been regularly approached to provide expert input to key WG reports and evaluations in the area of language planning, for example, *Process Evaluation of Cymraeg for Kids: final report* \[5.6\]. 

#####  Welsh Language Commissioner 

 Research undertaken by Hodges and Prys is regularly used to support WLC decision making and inform those public bodies legally required to adhere to the Welsh Language Standards published in 2015. Bangor University research underpins a co\-produced WLC report assessing the use of Welsh within the voluntary sector in Wales \[5.7\]. The report contains twenty recommendations for good practice and are the only guidelines for language use in the Third Sector. Senior Officer, Welsh Language Commissioner’s Hybu Team states: “We refer to this work in our training sessions for third sector organisations. The slides we have prepared include quotes from the research and our top tips were created based on this evidence” \[5.8\]. The WLC held several public events with voluntary organisations and stakeholders to promote the research findings and highlight examples of good practice. The WLC used the study to: “Raise awareness of the findings and recommendations through meeting with stakeholders such as Welsh Government, WCVA, County Voluntary Councils, county volunteer bureaus, GwirVol and The Duke of Edinburgh Award, Welsh Sports Association” \[5.7\]. Bangor research \[3.2\] also informs the WLC report, *My Language My Health* \[5.9\] and the best practice guidelines published by the WLC for county borough councils and National Park authorities \[5.10\]. 

#####  Language Promotion and Education 

 Research has informed language promotion initiatives across Wales and education practice across a range of age groups. A key development is the co\-produced toolkit \[5.11\] \(with Mentrau Iaith Cymru, the national organisation which supports the work of 22 local Menter Iaith language initiatives\) to promote the use of Welsh in the community. The toolkit is used by Mentrau Iaith Cymru \(MIC\) to train staff and it is hosted on its website for community actors to download. Menter Iaith Bangor, Cered and Menter Iaith Caerffili use the toolkit to facilitate discussions, to understand how Welsh speakers use the language in a variety of contexts, and Menter Iaith Bangor has since expanded their activities by hosting workshops and organised bi\-monthly community language panels \(Popdy Trafod Iaith\). Funded by Bangor University’s ESRC Impact Acceleration Account, dissemination and discussion workshops were held with local stakeholders in eight communities across Wales between March and May 2017. Confirming the use and significance of the toolkit, Team Leader, Mentrau Iaith Cymru states: “This practical resource has been of great use for both MIC and the local Menter Iaith initiatives, of which there are 22 organisations and over 100 members of staff. The toolkit contains valuable examples of innovative programs that can be adapted to work in various communities in Wales. As a result, the toolkit has been used during workshops and training days hosted by MIC” \[5.12\]. The toolkit was launched by the Minister for Lifelong Learning and Welsh Language at the 2017 National Eisteddfod and ignited important discussions on Welsh language community sustainability amongst practitioners and policy makers alike. 

 Responding to the need identified through research for enhanced availability of targeted materials in Welsh, particularly in relation to the prioritised group of teenagers and young people, Hodges and Prys have led on the development of unique multimedia Welsh\-medium Sociology materials and worked to develop new and standardised terminology. These are used to teach A Level, Welsh Baccalaureate, and Degree\-level Sociology across Wales. Their ground\-breaking *Dulliau Ymchwil* \(Research Methods\) online resource \[5.13\] has over 1000 views and is used in other disciplines, such as education, history and music. This work also contributed to the development of Welsh language terminology in sociology and research methods. Examples include coining terms such as ‘hapsamplu syml’ \(simple random sampling\) and ‘tanddosbarth’ \(underclass\). Their work has been incorporated into the *Termiadur Addysg* \(Education Terminology Dictionary\) which is utilised by all primary and secondary schools, further education colleges and universities in Wales.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Fibre\-based communication is pivotal to global communication and connectivity and requires high\-quality lasers to drive the increasing demand. Collaboration between Prof Kelly and Compound Semiconductor Technologies \(CST\) Global transformed their business model to allow them to become a world\-leading semiconductor laser supplier, with an 88% turnover increase \(2016–2017\). The research led to high\-performance, low\-cost laser devices for next\-generation optical access networks and novel products for home and datacentre markets. Consequently, CST Global was acquired by Sivers IMA for \~GBP12 million \(2017\) and staff numbers have increased from 11 to 70. >GBP1 million of laser chips were sold each month to customers around the world, increasing internet access to households through fibre\-to\-the\-home \(FTH\) connectivity.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Kelly’s EPSRC project on High Power, High Frequency Mode\-locked Semiconductor Lasers \(EP/E065112/1\) enabled him to build on a strong semiconductor lasers capability to design, fabricate and test indium phosphide\-based lasers. The fundamental research \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\] generated the necessary understanding of device behaviour and the capability to simulate and therefore design devices according to the intended application. For example, the development of high\-power devices increased the output power of the laser from 50 to 200mW, opening up new applications such as automotive LIDAR \(light detection and ranging\). 

 A collaboration was established with CST Global in 2011, supported by a UofG First Step Award. CST Global made a strategic business decision to move from being a foundry service to manufacturing their own products. They were already familiar with Prof Kelly’s expertise, and the University had the skills, tools and test equipment to design, develop and characterise devices manufactured by CST Global. This allowed them to work together to quickly develop initial data for a potential Gigabit Passive Optical Networks \(GPON\) laser product that was presented to customers. 

 Given positive market feedback, a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) was initiated to focus on the delivery of the first product, a high\-performance, low\-cost laser device for next generation optical access networks. The KTP associate, Dr Horacio Cantu, focused on understanding the electrical and parasitic behaviour of the device to allow performance optimisation. During this project, three semiconductor laser products were developed and introduced into the marketplace \[5.4\]. 

 The research collaboration was then extended to include research into low\-cost optical/radio interfaces, advanced fabrication techniques and blue laser diodes. The blue laser research \(supported by EPSRC / Innovate – CoolBlue EP/R001774/1\) resulted in the first practical blue semiconductor distributed feedback \(DFB\) laser.This was made possible by novel gratings designed by Prof Kelly and fabricated in the University’s James Watt Nanofabrication Centre. Innovate UK projects and direct funding by CST Global of Prof Kelly resulted in the development of 10 Gbit/s and 25 Gbit/s laser devices and the development of etched facets. 

 The range of projects and the fact that they are predominately Innovate UK\-funded demonstrates the commercial focus of the ongoing collaborative research. Applying the understanding developed in the research projects to device designs and improvements to key device parameters led to further application\-oriented publications \[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]. 

 A recent illustrative example of commercialisation of basic research is the work on advanced etching. A new semiconductor etch tool was made available to Prof Kelly via a GBP3 million EPSRC manufacturing grant. An industrial PhD scholarship \(2014–2018\), co\-funded by CST Global, developed advanced etching techniques on this tool and applied these techniques to the development of etched facets. This is a technology that had the potential to greatly reduce the cost of CST Global’s manufacturing process and led to an Innovate UK project \(LOWPASS\) which successfully took this to production. The process is now used by CST Global in high\-volume manufacturing and is set to become ubiquitous in their products.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Over the past decade, the world has become increasingly connected, as high\-speed fibre optic digital communication brings Internet access to households around the globe with fibre\-to\-the\-home \(FTH\) connectivity. The roll\-out of this technology depends on fast, powerful, low\-cost lasers to facilitate the data transfer over these connections. The collaboration between UofG’s Prof Kelly, and CST Global has enabled them to become a world\-leading supplier of semiconductor lasers \[5.1, 5.2\]. Whilst the impact of this research is primarily economic, secondary impacts exist through CST Global being able to meet the societal demand for access to fibre optic broadband and cable TV. 

 CST Global acknowledge that Prof Kelly’s expertise is what drew them to collaborate with UofG: The Former CEO of CST Global: *""\[Kelly\] is a world\-authority on gallium nitride and indium phosphide optical devices, with both academic and commercial experience in these areas. He has successfully commercialized a range of technologies, critical to next\-generation, high\-speed applications, where CST Global is currently producing and developing new products”* \[5.3\]. 

 Prior to its collaboration with UofG, CST Global was a foundry business, providing custom fabrication services \[5.1 paragraph 4\]. Expansion of CST Global was dependent on a business model change to selling products instead of services. The skills and capability available at UofG in high\-speed communications systems testing, device modelling and advanced characterisation \(built up via Scottish Research Pool investment and Research Council project funding\) allowed CST Global to develop products through funded collaborations \[5.1 paragraph 4, 5.4\]. 

 The close working relationship with UofG has been maintained since 2011 through research collaborations, secondments and KTPs. One of the first collaborations was a Knowledge Transfer Partnership: *'The main achievement for the project was the successful development of the 10Gbit/s product to a maturity where it was shipping to customers as samples and towards the end of the project as product. The significance of this has not to be underestimated. \[This\] has allowed CSTG to move up the value chain in terms of product complexity and therefore margin’* \[5.4\]. The former\-KTP Associate is now an employee of CST Global and continues to liaise with UofG and transfer knowledge to CST Global’s engineers \[5.1 paragraph 5\]. 

 The ongoing partnership has resulted in three new semiconductor laser product lines being introduced, with more in development through Prof Kelly’s secondments to the company. These products generated >GBP10 million in orders during 2016 alone \[5.1 paragraph 5\], which enabled CST Global’s expansion into the Asian market and up the value chain to higher profit margin products, moving from USD0.2 per unit to USD2 per unit, with the potential to increase to USD20 per unit once the 25 Gbit/s product line has been qualified \[5.1 paragraph 5\]. CST Global are now among the top suppliers in the world, with most of their market in China and India \[5.1 paragraph 6, 5.2\]. Due to its strong performance and potential for growth, CST Global was acquired by Sivers IMA in April 2017 for \~GBP12 million \[5.1 paragraph 6, 5.2\]. CST Global’s success from collaborating with UofG was the key driver of this acquisition, which has since led to further expansion of CST Global and also improved funding access \[5.1 paragraph 6\]. 

 As a consequence of the critical UofG collaboration, CST Global has become Europe’s highest volume laser supplier, shipping GBP1 million laser chips/month. CST Global currently employs 70 chip fabrication staff at a facility near Glasgow \[5.2\]. Its annual sales turnover for 2015/16 was \~GBP3.5 million; as a consequence of the acquisition, turnover was 88% higher in 2017 \(GBP6.7 million\) \[5.1, 5.5, 5.6\]. 

 CST Global links with UK supply chain companies, thus providing a vibrant industry sector. CST Global has been a partner in Horizon 2020 project iBrow, enabling enhanced wireless broadband data transfer, with industry partners including IQE, Alcatel\-Lucent and InescTec, and is leading two Innovate UK\-funded projects, CoolBlue and LowPass, working with UofG. CST Global’s strong connection with UofG has kept the company ‘ *at the forefront of the III\-V compound semiconductor market*’ \[5.7\]. 

 In 2017, through an EPSRC Impact Accelerator Account grant, Prof. Kelly was seconded to CST Global to develop capability in the 25 Gbit/s laser market supplying the datacentre market, a high\-growth area. In 2018, the company announced alpha testing of 25 Gbit/s lasers that will command far higher prices than existing products while maintaining the same chip manufacturing footprint, delivering a higher profit margin for the same manufacturing yield \[5.8\]. 

 Demand for such products is rapidly growing in China \[5.9\] where the number of cable TV subscribers is expected to rise to 353 million by 2022 \[5.10, page 1\]. CST Global’s ability to meet China’s increased demand for internet\-enabled TV is enabled by collaboration with Prof Kelly at UofG.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Francesca Gains’ research into gender and policymaking has **informed governance arrangements** and **influenced public policy** in Greater Manchester \(GM\) since the devolution deal was signed by 11 white men in November 2014. It has: 

1.  Set the policy agenda on the under\-representation of women in GM’s policymaking processes and city\-region cabinet. 

1.  Informed and influenced arrangements to amplify women’s voices in policymaking in GM through engagement with policymakers and campaigners. 

1.  Shaped the Equalities Strategy in GM pre\- and post\-COVID and the terms of reference for a new Women and Girls’ Equality Panel in GM by bringing together an evidence base. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 These impacts are underpinned by research conducted at the University of Manchester \(UoM\) since 2010, led by Professor Francesca Gains. Key research findings demonstrate the need to stimulate policy debate and campaign on the under\-representation of women in the GM devolution arrangements. 

 Award\-winning research conducted by Gains between 2010 to 2013 with Claire Annesley \(UoM until 2014\) and Isabelle Engeli \(Ottawa\) examines what happened when gender equality measures reached Government policy agendas in five European countries. It demonstrates that **policy measures to improve gender equality are difficult to get on government agendas** \[1\]. This research \(drawing on the Comparative Agendas Project \(www.comparativeagendas.net\) international data set\) shows that the key determinants which led to gender equality measures getting space on the agenda **are women’s representation in legislatures and their presence in executive roles** \(in Government\). 

 As well as the need to have diversity in political leadership, earlier research into policymaking on gender equality in the UK core executive \(with Annesley\) also finds that the ability of female politicians to bring forward government measures improves once they **have developed internal networks and equalities** **processes** \[2\] **.** The improved representation of women in the New Labour governments led to greater attention to gender equality. Furthermore, the ability of female politicians in the executive to bring forward government measures improved once they develop **an equalities cabinet committee** and are supported by a **policy machinery to gather evidence on equalities to inform policymaking**. 

 Later research conducted by Gains with Vivien Lowndes \(University of Birmingham\) provides further support that for the finding that **having women in decision\-making positions is key to securing policy action** \[3, 4\]. In a research project that formed part of the European Research Council \(ERC\)\-funded project ‘Understanding Institutional Change: A Gender Perspective, 2012\-2017’ \(i\) led by Professor Georgina Waylen at UoM, Gains and Lowndes examined how Police and Crime Commissioners \(PCCs\) prioritised \(or not\) the problem of violence against women and girls \(VAWG\). PCCs, like metro mayors, are directly elected and operate at the sub\-national level with delegated powers and budgets, similar to the governance arrangements that were then developing under metro mayors. Indeed, in GM the Mayor took over the powers of the PCC on taking office in 2017. 

 The research finds that female PCCs were twice as likely as their male counterparts to ensure VAWG was prioritised in PCC police and crime plans \(which set local priorities\). The **importance of an equalities policymaking, evidence gathering, and reporting process** is also seen in this research. Those PCCs – men and women – who took equalities duties seriously were nearly two and half times more likely to prioritise the problem of VAWG \[3, 4, 5\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 GM has a population of 2,700,000 – similar to that of Wales – and is a leading exemplar of devolution for the rest of England’s combined authorities. From the announcement of the GM Devolution Deal in November 2014 and throughout the Mayor’s first term of office \(election postponed to 2021 due to Covid\-19\), Gains strongly pushed for having women’s voices in policymaking in GM both in political leadership roles and in the policymaking process, and sought to embed research findings into the evidence base of equalities processes. This had three key impacts: 

#  1. Set the policy agenda on the under\-representation of women in GM’s policymaking processes and city\-region cabinet 

 Between November 2014 and April 2017, drawing on the key research findings, Gains set the policy debate on the under\-representation of women in GM devolution. This resulted in **greater female representation,** including the appointment of **a female deputy and a gender\-balanced cabinet.** 

 Gains argued in numerous contributions to public debate and in legislative consultations for three necessary developments in GM devolution arrangements: 

1.  improvements in policymaking processes to ensure **under\-represented groups** **have a voice in policy development**; 

1.  the executive functions of the mayoral and combined authority cabinet should better reflect diversity, including the appointment of a **female deputy** and **expanded gender\-balanced cabinet portfolio** roles; and 

1.  equalities **evidence to be included** **in policy development** and evaluation. 

 Gains presented these arguments in public panel discussions with the Interim GM Mayor Tony Lloyd \(2015\) and Andy Burnham MP \(then Mayoral candidate\) \(2016\) \[A\]. Deputy Mayor, Bev Hughes, testifies that Gains’ research has “ *influenced and informed arrangements to get women’s voices into policy making*” \[B\]. Amy Foots, Head of Implementation at Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\) notes that “ *Gains research has been instrumental in progressing the gender equality debate in Greater Manchester*” \[C\]. 

 Gains also influenced the ‘DivaManc’ campaign to develop the mayor’s manifesto commitment to a gender\-balanced cabinet in 2016. According to DivaManc’s co\-founder and councillor Eve Holt, Gains research *“enabled us to build a strong case for change and put forward clear, meaningful and achievable asks of GM leaders. Her work and thinking has added academic rigor and clarity which has been able to cut through and deliver tangible progress”* such as *“the **appointment of a female Deputy**”* \[D\]. 

 Gains’ research also influenced wider campaigns to ensure a gender\-balanced cabinet in GM in collaboration with the Fawcett Society and Local Government Information Unit \(LGIU\) for their  [Local Government Commission](https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/policy-research/local-government-commission/) – a year\-long study which asked ‘Does Local Government Work for Women?’. Sam Smethers, CEO of the Fawcett Society, states that Gains’ research and contributions “ *aided us in formulating the specific recommendations in our final report about increasing the number of women around the table when decisions are made, which were aimed at the combined authorities and Mayors*” \[E\]. Smethers also attests to the influence of Gains’ research into **Police and Crime Commissioner** \(PCC\) arrangements \[3\] when making the case for the positive impact that women in positions of power in local government can have, such as on the prioritisation of tackling domestic violence. These findings were cited in the media in the lead up to the 2017 mayoral elections, evidencing the influence of Gains’ research on the importance of equalities briefs in combined authorities \[F\]. 

#  2. Informed and influenced arrangements to amplify women’s voices in policymaking in GM through engagement with policymakers and campaigners 

 Following the election of the new mayor, Andy Burnham, Gains continued engagement with policymakers and campaigners informed and influenced arrangements to amplify women’s voices in policymaking in GM. This in turn helped shape the development of a scorecard for equal participation and influenced campaigns for gender equality in Greater Manchester. 

 After meeting Helen Pankhurst, founder member of the Greater Manchester for Women 2028 group, in April 2018, Gains joined the steering committee for a campaign led by Pankhurst \(GM4Women2028\) to address continuing gender inequality in GM. Pankhurst writes that Gains helped to develop “ *a scorecard to track a range of equality indicators”* \[G\] and “ *influenced the choice of the scorecard for participation in suggesting a gender balanced mayoral cabinet as a key equality measure in Greater Manchester’s devolution arrangements….*\[This\] *provide\[d\] a focus on a critical representation indicator **which her research shows will ‘unlock’ other policy outcomes through better and more diverse representation inside the combined authority"" \[G\]. Pankhurst states that Gains brought *“together campaigners, policymakers and researchers to share knowledge of how to get all women’s voices into policymaking...* \[which\] *will **build capacity, knowledge and vital networks to support the policymaking process around equality in Greater Manchester**”* \[G\]. 

 Gains produced an **influential research\-informed guide**,’ Mind the Gap: Getting Women’s Voices into Policy Making’ \[H\]. As Amy Foots, Head of Implementation at Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\) states, *“The publication provides an important contribution to the debate on gender equality and is helping to drive our work forward on this agenda in GM”* \[C\]. According to the Deputy Mayor, Bev Hughes, this publication established “ *a strong foundation upon which our priorities for turbo\-charging women and girls’ equality can flourish”* \[B\]. Pankhurst further notes that it “ *influenced the approach taken by the* \[GM4Women2028\] *campaign to working with the newly established Greater Manchester Women and Girls’ Equality Panel”* \[G\]. 

#  3. Shaped the Equalities Strategy in GM and the terms of reference for a new Women and Girls’ Equality Panel in GM by bringing together an evidence base 

 Gains’ research finds that networks of campaigners and policymakers are needed to bring together the evidence base needed to drive changes in the policy infrastructure and equalities policymaking \[3, 4, 5\]. As the mayor and combined authority governance arrangements commenced in June 2017, interventions by Gains, including the publication of *On Gender*, brought **together an evidence base** on gender to support an equalities strategy and more **permanent governance arrangements** that support equality considerations in policymaking. Bev Hughes, Deputy Mayor, notes that Gains “ *research on gender equality has been instrumental in highlighting the need for a more permanent piece of infrastructure to accelerate gender equality in Greater Manchester*” \[B\]. This led to **the establishment of a Women and Girls’ Equality Panel in the GMCA and the shaping of its terms of reference.** This panel **ensures that gender equality is actively considered in all GMCA decisions** and the wider Greater Manchester system. \(Gains was also selected to be on this panel\). Amy Foots, Head of Implementation, GMCA, further notes that “ *\[t\]he terms of reference developed for the Panel were also influenced by* \[her\] *research*”, in addition to her research being key to the establishment of the panel \[C\]. 

 Following the appointment of Bev Hughes as Deputy Mayor with responsibility for Policing and Crime in GM, Gains was invited to meet Hughes to discuss the underpinning research. In 2019, Gains was asked to join a new internal Greater Manchester Combined Authority **Women’s Voices Task and Finish Group,** that *“helped to shape and inform the establishment of a permanent Women and Girls’ Equality Panel and work programme”* \[D\]. For this Task Group, Gains brought together evidence based on her research with Vivien Lowndes \[3, 4\] and that of other relevant gender researchers at UoM to make the case that equalities policymaking was necessary across all policy areas. Of the resulting publication, ‘On Gender *’* \[I\], Hughes testifies: *“This research was an important contribution to the evidence base on gender equality in Greater Manchester and highlighted the importance of understanding how gender inequalities affect our region. It also informed the Group’s work programme, helping to target action and monitor progress”* \[B\]. 

 Gains’ policy brief, ‘Building Back a Gendered Better’ \[J\], highlights the gendered impacts of the pandemic and delineates measures to ameliorate these. This has influenced GMCA’s response to the pandemic. According to Foots, Head of Implementation in GMCA, it “ *has influenced the **post\-COVID\-19 recovery planning** for the Combined Authority and will help inform the agenda strategy for the Women and Girls’ Equality Panel as it develops its plans”* \[C\]. 

 Summing up, Holt states that the evidence base brought together by Gains *“highlighted the importance of listening to women’s voices in their full diversity throughout the policy making process”* \[D\] and Deputy Mayor Hughes attests that Gains’ work *“set gender equality **firmly on the agenda** in Greater Manchester”* \[B\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 *ClimateJust* \(www.climatejust.org.uk\) is a web\-based mapping tool that facilitates socially\-aware decision\-making by showing how, where and to what extent exposure to risk and social vulnerabilities intersect to produce ‘climate disadvantage’. Both the mapping tool and the key concept of climate disadvantage that underpins it have been widely used by a variety of policymakers and other public bodies both nationally and internationally, helping them to understand how climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable groups and informing planning decisions, adaptation strategies and practitioner guidance. Users include the UK government, the Town and Country Planning Association, Friends of the Earth, and public bodies in Liverpool, Hull, Glasgow, Staffordshire and Helsinki. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 *ClimateJust* \(hereafter ‘CJ’\) was conceived as a result of research conducted for an interdisciplinary project, *Justice, Vulnerability & Climate Change: An Integrated Framework*, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation \(JRF, 2010\-11\). The project was led by O’Neill in collaboration with several co\-investigators and postdocs from three disciplines: philosophy, geography and planning. The website and online mapping tool were developed during a second project, *ClimateJust* \(on which O’Neill was a CI\) *,* supported by the JRF and the Environment Agency \(Midlands region\) and launched in 2015, with a subsequent relaunch with modifications in 2018. 

 The CJ mapping tool combines specific dimensions of ‘climate vulnerability’ – explained below – with exposure to physical risk \(primarily flooding and heatwaves\). This allows users to assess the levels of – and contributors to – ‘climate disadvantage’ present in specific areas of the UK at different levels of granularity, in a similar way to Google Maps. The intellectual framework that underpins CJ derives directly from John O’Neill’s work on climate justice, which defines, and defends the importance of, the notions of climate vulnerability and climate disadvantage that are enshrined in CJ’s algorithms and user interface. 

 Climate impacts can affect anyone, but some people are more acutely affected than others. How badly people are affected depends not only on their exposure to events like floods and heatwaves but also on various forms of social vulnerability. **‘Climate vulnerability’** denotes the extent to which one would be negatively affected by climate impacts. Factors that contribute to climate vulnerability include income, lack of local knowledge, disability, lack of private transport, lack of community support, and housing characteristics; so, for example, other things being equal low\-income households have greater climate vulnerability than high\-income households. **Climate disadvantage** combines climate vulnerability with exposure to physical risk. Thus those with the highest level of climate disadvantage are typically those who have a high level of climate vulnerability *and* a high level of exposure to physical risk. 

 In order to measure climate vulnerability, however, one needs to have a clear idea of what is being measured *.* Having one’s house flood impacts negatively on everyone, but it will impact more negatively on the wellbeing of unemployed asylum\-seekers than it will on a middle\-class British home\-owning family. A clear conception of ‘wellbeing’ is required so that negative impacts on it can be identified and measured. O’Neill’s work was crucial to this key component of the conceptual framework behind, and the specific factors that are counted as elements of climate vulnerability by, the CJ tool. 

 
O’Neill \[1,2\] has criticised subjective state and preference satisfaction accounts of wellbeing, arguing that they cannot capture the full range of dimensions of well\-being put at risk by climate change. He has instead \[3,4\] defended a version of the ‘objective\-state’ account, endorsing a needs\-based account and – most significantly – developing that account in the context of vulnerability to climate hazards, thus delivering the concept of climate vulnerability. O’Neill argues that needs\-based approach, as opposed to a capabilities approach, is justified in that certain achieved functionings \(as opposed to capabilities\) – ‘fertile functionings’ – are a condition of the very possibility of exercising capabilities. For example, being housed is a fertile functioning: people displaced by floods lose the ability to engage in long\-term planning, which undermines their ability to exercise various capabilities, which in turn puts other central functionings at risk, for example concerning livelihood or children’s education. A practical advantage of this approach is that these functionings and their loss are measurable in a way that capabilities are not.

 The research for CJ specifically \[5,6\] developed a particular account of climate vulnerability that was used to create empirically informed measures of the factors that affect the degree to which different groups would be affected by climate hazards such as heat waves and floods, under five broad headings: *sensitivity, enhanced exposure, ability to prepare, ability to respond,* and *ability to recover*. These were incorporated into the CJ mapping tool as dimensions of socio\-spatial vulnerability to climate hazards \(that is, climate vulnerability\), which, together with risk exposure, combine to produce an overall measure of climate disadvantage. \(Fig. 1 shows this for England in the case of flooding.\)

#  4. Details of the impact 

 **Beneficiaries: CJ’s primary beneficiaries have been public bodies, policymakers, and professional, voluntary and community organisations with a role in supporting adaptation to climate change in the UK – and, to some extent, overseas. 

 **Pathways to impact: Since CJ’s launch in 2015, members of the project team have led or contributed to over 30 events, with a combined audience of over 600 people, designed to explain the benefits and potential uses of the mapping tool to – and to train – potential users. These included a series of five training events for local authority elected members and planning officers run by the Town and Country Planning Association, three training workshops in Cumbria, supported by the Big Lottery and run by Cumbria Action for Sustainability, following local flood incidents; and two further events run separately by the National Flood Forum supporting local application of the CJ website as part of stakeholder engagement on flood risk management. The CJ team’s 2018 Scottish training event was oversubscribed resulting in an additional, independently resourced Adaptation Scotland event. Support by external agencies and cascading of ideas through academic, policy and practice networks have been pivotal in achieving the range and depth of influence seen to date. 

#  *Impacts of the research:* 

 CJ has generated impact with national significance and reach, which has extended into mainland Europe. CJ is described in a European Environment Agency Technical Paper \[A\] as *“a flagship example of a knowledge hub focused on social justice in the climate change context”* \(p.25\). The CJ website and mapping tool are free to use and have so far reached over 38,000 users. Since a \(free\) user registration scheme was launched in June 2018, 1432 users have registered, 26% of whom are local government staff, with other users including consultancies, charities and community organisations. Both **the mapping tool** and **the key concept of climate disadvantage** that underpins it have helped embed the idea that not only physical risk but also social vulnerability is crucial to decision\-making; below are listed some of the various ways in which a wide variety of users have benefited. 

#  *National impact:* 

-  **UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 Evidence Report:** Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK government is required to provide a UK\-wide climate change risk assessment every 5 years. The 2017 assessment was carried out by the Adaptation Sub\-committee of the Committee for Climate Change at the request of Defra. ‘Climate disadvantage’ – the core conceptual innovation of CJ that combines risk of exposure and climate vulnerability – plays a central role in Chapter 8 of the report \(‘Cross\-Cutting Issues’, \[B\]\). The chapter states that there is *“strong evidence that climate risks will affect people differently, depending on their social, economic and cultural environment”*, listing this as one of the three main cross\-cutting issues relating to the risks of climate change \(p.4\). ‘Climate disadvantage’ appears in the list \(on p.5\) of common concepts used in the chapter and the concept is used throughout the analysis, along with the more specific concepts of flood and heat disadvantage. The CJ mapping tool was used to generate maps showing how social vulnerability to flooding and flood risk in the UK combine to create flood disadvantage \(p.20\). 

 **Town and Country Planning Association/Royal Town Planning Institute:** The 2018 TCPA/RTPI report, *Rising to the Climate Crisis: A Guide for Local Authorities on Planning for Climate Change* \[C\] is *“designed to inform the preparation of strategic and local development plans being prepared by local and combined authorities in England”* \(p.4\). Hugh Ellis, Director of Policy at the TCPA notes that previous *“guidance on climate change adaptation issued to planning professionals ... made no reference to the concept of climate justice”* \[D\]; by contrast, the 2018 report introduces climate justice at the outset \(Section 1.1 *Climate Justice*\) and specifically recommends CJ: *“Fairness and justice should be at the heart of planning for climate change, based on an acknowledgement that climate change affects those on the lowest incomes the worst. The ClimateJust resource provides a powerful way of mapping the relationship between social exclusion and the impacts of climate change, offering the opportunity to tailor policy to meet the needs of those likely to be most vulnerable to climate change”* \[C, p.6\]. CJ is also recommended in Section 4.2, ‘The evidence base for plan\-making’ \[C, p.24\]. 

 **Friends of the Earth’s \(FoE\) **Climate Action** website:** CJ provides one of the datasets used by FoE in its ratings of local authorities – available via postcode search on its *Climate Action* website \(takeclimateaction.uk/climate\-action/how\-climate\-friendly\-your\-area\) – on a range of issues related to climate change \[E\]. 

#  *Regional impact:* 

 **Hull City Council \(HCC\):** HCC’s Environment and Climate Change Strategic Advisor notes that HCC *“were able to use the ClimateJust maps and resources in our internal discussions with different services as part of our strategy development to help identify vulnerable communities and consider service responses. We were also able to use presentation material developed by the Climate Just team to highlight the risks to senior managers in the Council’s Health and Wellbeing Board, and to develop greater engagement with the social care sector on the future risks posed by higher temperatures and overheating. This helped to inform plans for a new care home scheme in the city including ensuring design was future proofed as well as increasing the Extra Care provider’s understanding of the impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups and the wider community resource the centre could provide in extreme weather events”* \[F\]. 

 **Climate Ready Clyde \(CRC\)** is an initiative supported by the Scottish Government to create a shared vision, strategy and action plan for adapting Glasgow City Region. Kit England of CRC reports: *“The ClimateJust mapping tool enables us to understand social vulnerability to climate change ... we have been able to integrate data used in the ClimateJust mapping tool within our own Geographic Information System, and particularly into the Climate Ready Clyde Climate Risk and Opportunity Assessment, which has in turn formed our Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan. The tool has informed other adaptation strategies in Scotland, such as the Aberdeen Adaptation Strategy \(by Aberdeen Adapts\), recognising that socially vulnerable neighbourhoods are over\-represented in areas prone to flooding”* \[G\]. 

 **Staffordshire County Council \(SCC\):** The Manager for Sustainability and Waste Strategy combined CJ maps with internal datasets to identify places to focus resources and engage multiple stakeholders. She notes that *“This activity added the social disadvantage element not captured by our original risk assessment on flooding”* \[H\]. One of the areas \(Rolleston village\) has since received an additional GBP30,000 to help with property protection \[H\]. 

 **Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust \(RLBUHT\):** CJ played a central role in the RLBUHT’s Sustainability Plan for 2016\-17 \[I\]. The RLBUHT’s Head of Sustainability notes that the CJ website *“was used in the Trust’s Sustainability Plan 2016\-17 to engage and influence staff and partners, including senior management and clinical staff ... and also our partners in Liverpool’s Knowledge Quarter and across the wider NHS”* \[I\] and that *“the maps of the Liverpool area surrounding the hospital highlighting social vulnerability and flood disadvantage in relation to surface water flooding were really valuable to us for demonstrating visually where the social impacts may be felt the most. Climate change adaptation is more abstract than mitigation and so being able to highlight the areas of particular concern visually was valuable in engaging key stakeholders”* \[I\]. The Sustainability Plan was given the highest rating of all English NHS organisations by the NHS Sustainable Development Unit. The Trust’s engagement with CJ was highlighted as a ‘good practice’ case study by the Liverpool City\-Region Brussels Office’s 2017 report, *Building Climate Resilience* \[p.12, I\]. 

#  *International impact:* 

 **Helsinki Regional Area:** A former staff member at the Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority \(HSY\) reports: *“Prior to our use of ClimateJust in 2015, when the first vulnerability mapping was done for Helsinki*, *the issues of climate disadvantage and social vulnerability to climate change had not been considered. Our use of ClimateJust ... confirmed which areas of the city were less well\-off ... and showed that the areas which are more well\-off were mostly protected from potential flooding ... If we did not have access to the ClimateJust resources, we would not have been able to carry out this type of mapping exercise ... and we would not have been able to build in the vulnerability indicators”* \[J\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Asthma is the commonest childhood disease, affecting around 1,000,000 children in the UK and 100,000,000 worldwide. Treatment is delivered with inhaler devices, but adherence is often poor. Our research at the University of Manchester on sound analysis and gamification has transformed treatment acceptability by developing an inhaler mask with an audible whistle sound to indicate good technique. This whistle sound activates cartoons on a mobile device specifically designed to encourage compliance. The technology has led to a spinout company, Clin\-e\-cal, and been used by over 100,000 children worldwide. Studies demonstrate it reduces problems in medication delivery. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Children with asthma are often anxious about treatment and have poor adherence with their medication, leading to serious health consequences. The aim of this project was to counter this major health issue by producing an affordable system which would improve breathing technique and adherence with treatment for children with asthma symptoms. 

 In early studies, Aslam developed expertise in computerised image processing including transformation and analysis of image data with highly sensitive and specific expert system algorithms. These algorithms have been able to extract clinically relevant information from ophthalmic images taken using multiple imaging modalities \[1, 2\]. The same techniques acquired in ophthalmology were used for this respiratory project to analyse and extract clinically useful information from the sound of correct inhaler use to detect correct inhalations. 

 Aslam studied gamification techniques with Henson to facilitate the complex tasks of measuring peripheral visual fields in children \[3\] and with Murray to develop automated and accurate central vision testing using games on tablet computers \[4, 5\]. Principles from these ophthalmology projects, to encourage children to interact with vision tests via games, were translated to encourage children to interact with inhaler medication. 

 Aslam used the above experience to design a system for masks and spacers such that the sounds of correct inhalation could be detected and activate multi\-stage cartoon animations / games on a screen – these would reduce anxiety and encourage specific and correct breathing patterns in children. In collaboration with Murray, Aslam designed and conducted a study to measure the impact of the device on children’s acceptance of spacer treatment using questionnaires given to children and parents \[6\]. Both parents and children responded positively to the device in this initial feasibility study: 13/14 children said it helped them take their medication and 13/14 parents felt that the device helped their children use their spacer and made them calmer. Children responded positively, citing the system as something that was fun rather than stressful. 

 This system provided the framework for a final version named Rafi\-tone \(‘Respiratory Aid for Inhalers’\). Rafi\-tone consists of a mask that emits a whistle when the child is breathing correctly, serving as a simple, reliable and reassuring indicator to children and parents. Detection of the whistle sound by a mobile application can drive a cartoon game, designed to encourage the correct form of breathing \- the system essentially involves children in an onscreen, fun, animated game, which rewards them for correct inhaler use.

","
#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 Asthma is a life\-threatening disease requiring drug\-delivery into the lungs via devices known as inhalers. Younger children can find taking the inhaler difficult and so it is often attached to one end of a cylindrical chamber, or spacer, and then pressed to release the drug into this spacer. A mask on the other end of the spacer allows the child to breathe in the drug more easily from the chamber through several breaths. However, this technique is associated with poor adherence and reduced drug delivery to the lungs. Treatments are missed or given with poor technique, which is exacerbated by children being distressed. Poor adherence with spacers in children is a major health and socio\-economic problem, with an estimated 14% of all children globally experiencing symptoms, and levels of adherence to treatment reported to be as low as 28%. 

##  Pathway to impact – new technology 

 The Rafi\-tone system, developed in 2016, uses a mask designed to produce a specific whistle which provides an auditory cue when breathing is correct. Software provides entertaining visual encouragement to a child when this is heard \(Figure 1\) and logs correct treatment in a digital calendar. The mask whistle improves carer and children’s confidence that the drug has been inhaled, and the additional app is used by educators to train carers and children in whistle spacer use, especially if there are known compliance issues. 



 Figure 1. Illustration of the mask, spacer and inhaler, with mask whistle activating the Rafi\-tone games. 

 Aslam’s research is novel in providing an accessible system, combining animation type games to motivate treatment compliance and providing reassurance to parents/ carers that optimum treatment has been given. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

###  Clinical impact on asthmatic children worldwide 

 The mask and associated app make inhaler use more fun, transforming perceptions and improving adherence and breathing technique in children. 

 An independent, international randomised controlled trial of 371 children was conducted, comparing app use with standard verbal instructions \[A\]. The trial found that lung functions of children using the app were significantly \(p<0.001\) improved. The percentage of patients improved according to an asthma control test was higher in the app group compared to the verbal instruction group. Compliance also improved subjectively and objectively. 

 An independent post\-marketing survey of 6\-10 weeks’ use of the mask and app was conducted on 112 asthmatics \(aged 1\-11\) and their parents. Survey results showed that use of doctor/hospital services reduced from 16/6 at baseline to 4/1 respectively at follow\-up \[B\]. All of the 10 independent healthcare practitioners surveyed stated that their patients were better controlled using the Rafi\-tone system \[B\]. This evidence implies significant benefit to children who have used the system. There have been over 112,000 international mask sales since its inception in 2016. App use is steadily rising, with over 4,000 maintained downloads, currently 250 per month \(as at July 2020\). The mask and app are available in the UK, France, Norway, Sweden and Australia. 

 A GP practice pharmacist stated that she “ *had the most amazing experience*” with the Rafi\-tone system and that this technology was a “ *game changer*” for her practice and patients \[C\]. Other quotes from health carers have included “ *Great idea. Easy to use and good distraction for children—makes inhaler delivery so much easier*” \[D\]. Example quotes from parents have included “ *Good distraction and improved technique. New to inhalers so made him less scared*”; *‘‘Yes, it has definitely helped in breathing technique. T* *was previously taking shallow breaths but with the game managed to focus on deeper breaths and concentrated on playing the game.’’;* “… *helps to direct the child’s attention and focus on breathing. Enjoyable activity. No bad points \- a really good idea. A good way to introduce inhalers*” \[D\]. 

###  Economic impact of Clin\-e\-cal, a new technology company 

 Clin\-e\-cal, an innovative digital health company, arose entirely from the research for Rafi\-tone. Founded by Aslam through a partnership with doctors, researchers and hospital teams, it has been established now for six years \[E\]. Clin\-e\-cal’s collaboration with Clement Clarke International directly led to the whistle that activates the Rafi\-tone app. The app successfully qualified for the prestigious NHS apps store \[F\]. The mask is produced by Clement Clarke and is available via prescription \[G\], meaning that it is readily available. 

 Clin\-e\-cal has two full\-time members of staff, a board of six members and robust and increasing income streams of approximately currently GBP20,000 per month. The company has attracted GBP250,000 external venture capital funding, allowing expansion and diversification. 

 In summary, research studies, testimonials and sales indicate that the easily accessible Rafi\-tone technology has transformed clinical care for tens of thousands of children internationally, improving adherence and addressing the serious morbidity associated with asthma and viral induced wheeze.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Working in collaboration with Huntsman Polyurethanes, UofG researchers have developed a new reaction model that comprehensively describes phosgene synthesis catalysis over an activated carbon catalyst. This knowledge has allowed continued improvements in plant operational practice to improve the feedstream management in the phosgene synthesis process and refine their catalyst activation and heat recovery strategies across their Rotterdam \(Netherlands\), Caojing \(China\) and Geismar \(USA\) manufacturing facilities. The open\-source publication of research outputs from the UofG/Huntsman collaboration has restricted competing companies from patenting large blocks of process operations with direct connections to Huntsman’s phosgene synthesis operations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UofG research led by Prof. Lennon \(physical chemistry\) and Prof. Winfield \(inorganic chemistry\) has advanced the fundamental understanding of the physico\-chemical processes required for the industrial scale production of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate \(MDI, OCNC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NCO\), a component in the production of polyurethanes. 

 Despite its industrial pertinence, there have been few publications over the last 70 years in the open literature on phosgene synthesis catalysis connected with large\-scale chemical manufacturing operations. This is, in part, due to the difficulty in safely handling of hazardous chlorinated materials such as chlorine \(Cl\), hydrogen chloride and phosgene. For over 18 years, the industrial/academic partnership between UofG research and Huntsman Polyurethanes sought to address these deficiencies, advancing capability directly relevant to this area of commercial endeavour. Phosgene is generally manufactured on\-site as a precursor in the MDI process chain, to minimise hazards associated with the storage and transportation of this highly toxic gas. 

 This underpinning phase of the collaborative venture includes \(i\) investigating issues connected with Cl recovery within an MDI process chain \[3.1\] and \(ii\) an examination of unfavourable consequences of over\-phosgenation of intermediates encountered within the MDI process chain \[3.2\]. 

 For the latter body of work, the industrialists assisted the academic team by sharing ‘best practice’ in phosgene safe\-handling procedures. In 2011 this culminated in the Huntsman’s investment as a founding partner in the School of Chemistry’s Chemical Process Fundamentals Laboratory \(CPFL\), a facility designed to investigate various areas of technical chemistry. In 2012 a phosgene synthesis catalysis facility was commissioned by Huntsman within the CPFL. 

 A series of three publications from the CPFL has led to a new awareness in phosgene synthesis. The first paper describes a series of laboratory procedures for analysing candidate phosgene synthesis catalysts, including protocols adopted for the safe handling of this hazardous reaction system \[3.3\]. The second paper considers such topics as activation energy, reaction profile and mass balance relationships. The work also determines the rate law for phosgene synthesis over the selected substrate \[3.4\]. The third paper examines adsorption and desorption characteristics of reagents and product \[3.5\]. Together this work by UofG has developed \(in collaboration with Huntsman Polyurethanes\) a new reaction model that comprehensively describes how CO and Cl<sub>2</sub> combine over activated carbon to produce phosgene at high selectivity, in an industrial process environment. This model is the backbone of the Impact Case Study. 

 The mechanism proposed shows dissociatively adsorbed dichlorine resides in two sites; one site supports phosgene formation \(via a ballistic collision with CO\), whilst the other does not. Thus, a degree of Cl is retained at the catalyst surface that does not directly engage in phosgene production. This matter is confirmed by mass balance measurements, a parameter rarely encountered in halogen\-themed heterogeneous catalysis. Moreover, building on this heightened awareness of phosgene synthesis, a subsequent paper demonstrated how Br<sub>2</sub>, a common impurity in the Cl<sub>2</sub> feedstream, can significantly modify the surface chemistry of phosgene synthesis over activated carbon in an industrial setting \[5.3\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Huntsman Polyurethanes is a global leader in MDI\-based polyurethanes, serving over 3,000 customers in more than 90 countries, with applications in diverse areas such as construction, automotive components, and insulation. The Company operates world\-scale production facilities in the US, The Netherlands and China, reporting a sales revenue for the last 12 months of USD3.5 billion \[5.1\]. 

 Huntsman’s MDI\-based polyurethanes *“play a critical role in addressing many of the global megatrends affecting the world today. As the most effective thermal insulant in the market, MDI\-based polyurethane is widely used to deliver energy savings solutions in residential and commercial buildings. It is used throughout the cold chain, in refrigerators and cold stores, helping preserve food.*” \[5.2\]. 

 As noted in Section 2, phosgene is generally manufactured on\-site as a precursor in the MDI process chain. Due to commercial confidentially, Huntsman are unable to quantify the precise financial benefits to them of the UofG research concerning individual steps in multi\-stage overall manufacturing processes of MDI\-based polyurethanes \[5.1\]. They can, however, report on how the company is utilising the knowledge gleaned from the phosgene synthesis catalysis project. 

 The UofG Model has enabled the Company to improve plant operational practice and feedstream management in the phosgene synthesis process. The open\-source publication of research outputs was strategically sought to restrict competing companies from patenting large blocks of process operations with direct connections to Huntsman’s phosgene synthesis operations. 

            1.  **Improved management of bromine \(Br\) and chlorine \(Cl\) in the phosgene synthesis process**. 

 Huntsman’s large\-scale MDI manufacturing facilities consume high volumes of Cl at their Rotterdam \(400,000 tonnes per annum; tpa\), Caojing \(240,000 tpa\) and Geismar \(500,000 tpa\) plants.  The UofG Model was applied to evaluate concern related to small quantities of Br<sub>2</sub> in the Cl<sub>2</sub> feedstream. This matter is of importance to the Company because trace contamination of Br can result in unwelcome MDI colouration. Although process patents exist to mitigate against the presence of small quantities of Br<sub>2</sub> in the Cl<sub>2</sub> feedstream of phosgene synthesis units \[5.5\-5.8\], a submitted UofG/Huntsman collaborative publication \[5.3\] is the only open source and transparent scientific paper that addresses the issue of how the Br<sub>2</sub> affects the surface chemistry of the phosgene synthesis process. 

 Through a rigorous experimental programme undertaken in the CPFL, the UofG reaction model has been adapted to explain the action of small quantities of Br<sub>2</sub>. For the first time, this has shown the Company how the reaction system is modified in the presence of Br<sub>2</sub>. The UofG Model highlights a role for BrCl and additionally assesses the relevance of entities such as COBrCl and COBr<sub>2</sub> \[5.3\]. The Company has combined this knowledge with their own pre\-existing thermodynamic model \(that excludes surface interactions\) to rationalise how the Br is partitioning within the large\-scale reaction system. This knowledge has enabled Huntsman to improve their adaptability to the source material and produce higher quality MDI through improved management of Br incorporation. It also enables them to mitigate the impact of chlorine\-quality variations on unwelcome MDI colouration through manipulation of the temperature gradient at the rear of the reactor \[5.8\]. 

            1.  **Application of UofG model to improve plant operational practice** 

 The UofG Model in Section 2 comprehensively describes phosgene production over an activated carbon catalyst to produce phosgene at high selectivity in an industrial process environment. Huntsman have applied the UofG model to their thermodynamic model of phosgene production to deliver on\-going improvements in plant operational practice concerning two linked actions: \(i\) the initial catalyst conditioning process and \(ii\) heat recovery. Phosgene formation is highly exothermic which can lead to increased reaction temperatures in the centre of the catalyst bed. The UofG reaction model has been used to justify why certain Cl pre\-treatments lead to more sustained phosgene production and extended catalyst lifetimes. These advancements at the industrial complex have enhanced the ability to maintain sustained maximum Cl conversion. The awareness provided by the academic researchers has assisted Huntsman chemists and chemical engineers in improving operational efficiency at their large\-scale phosgene synthesis facilities. 

 **3. Strategic investment in the CPFL by Huntsman.** 

 Huntsman has invested £300,000 in this long\-standing academic/industrial partnership to understand the fundamentals of phosgene synthesis and has been fully supportive of publishing research outcomes of in the open literature. This has \(i\) efficiently disseminated new awareness of a hazardous chemical process *“contributing to cultural change in the whole isocyanate manufacturing sector”* \[5.1\] and \(ii\) produced a wide scope of technical material into the public domain. This latter attribute had a business driver; namely, to restrict the Company’s competitors from patenting large blocks of process operations with direct connections to Huntsman’s global phosgene synthesis operations.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 By revealing the most cost\-effective interventions to combat malaria, advanced modelling by Dr. Griffin and collaborators has informed leading international investment in antimalarial intervention – and protected millions of lives as a result. Griffin assessed the costs and benefits of four leading malaria intervention strategies to form recommendations that were subsequently used by the Global Fund – an international funding partnership that provides 65% of all international funding to anti\-malaria programmes in 41 countries in sub\-Saharan Africa – to strategically allocate USD4,000,000,000 of funding in 2017–2019. Typically, the Fund allocates its funding according to World Health Organization \(WHO\) guidelines, but in 2017, no such guidelines existed. By following the advice of Griffin and colleagues, the Fund’s activities saved as many as 87,000 lives and reduced the number of new malaria cases by up to 27,000,000.

#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Malaria is one of the leading global causes of death and morbidity, infecting 230,000,000 and killing over 440,000 people per year. Over 80% of fatalities occur in Africa, making this continent a priority for research and policy efforts. Griffin is part of an influential network of scientists guiding international policy on malaria interventions, and has applied his modelling expertise to researching malaria control in collaboration with staff members at the WHO: a\) estimating the progress of funding in relation to the 2020 milestone of USD6,500,000,000 \[3.1\]; b\)  mapping malaria in human and parasite populations \[3.2\] and c\) assessing the efficacy of malaria interventions \[3.3\]. In recognition of his expertise, Griffin also holds an honorary position at Imperial College’s MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling. Griffin’s work covers two key areas of malaria research: the mechanism of transmission, and the effectiveness of different interventions. 

#  Modelling the transmission of malaria and the likelihood of local eradication 

 Many simple modelling studies suggest that malaria transmission demonstrates bistable equilibrium behaviour. This means that the disease can persist indefinitely even if its basic reproduction number \(R0\), the average number of secondary infections caused by a single malaria case within a susceptible population, is below one. Griffin used two published mathematical models, which had both been fitted to detailed, age\-stratified data on multiple outcomes, to demonstrate that this is not the case. Instead, he found that immunity reduces onward infectiousness. This implies that if interventions can reduce R0 to below one for long enough, then malaria can be locally eradicated \[3.4\]. 

#  Modelling the efficacy of malaria control interventions 

 Griffin and collaborators addressed a knowledge gap by evaluating the costs and benefits of introducing new anti\-malaria interventions versus scaling up existing interventions \[3.5\]. Previous studies had proved the effectiveness of measures such as ‘long\-lasting insecticide\-treated bed nets’ \(‘bed nets’\) in reducing malaria deaths, but the relative cost\-effectiveness of these measures remained unknown – particularly in light of new and emerging interventions such as the RTS,S malaria vaccine. In this research, which was carried out as part of his honorary position at the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, Griffin and colleagues developed a model that accounted for parasite prevalence in the absence of interventions other than treatment, the annual seasonal pattern of transmission and the mosquito vector species present and their associated biology. They considered two approaches for costing increasing coverage of four interventions \(bed nets, house spraying, seasonal drugs and the vaccine\). The first approach assumed increases in coverage were associated with linear increases in cost, while the second approach derived non\-linear relationships between coverage and unit costs \[3.5\]. The analysis would not have been possible without Griffin’s contribution, which was to combine data on the effect of these interventions from experimental studies and clinical trials covering 42 countries in sub\-Saharan Africa with the developed disease transmission model, enabling this comprehensive and comparative simulation of multiple epidemiological outcomes for malaria. 

 The research in \[3.5\] revealed that the vaccine should only be implemented after high coverage has been achieved with the three other interventions, which should remain of higher priority across sub\-Saharan Africa than rollout of the vaccine. Specifically, bed nets are the most cost\-effective intervention to prevent malaria infection; once 60% coverage of bed nets has been achieved \(Figure 1\), the next most cost\-effective measures are to a\) prioritise seasonal drug treatment in settings where transmission is seasonal or b\) otherwise focus on spraying houses with insecticide. The vaccine only becomes cost\-effective once high coverage of other interventions has been achieved. The recommended schedule for the RTS,S vaccine only covers a small subset of the exposed population \(children aged 5–27 months\), and offers partial protection to this group for a duration of roughly 4 years. As a result, it does not induce herd immunity in the population and, at a cost of USD5  per dose, is considerably more expensive per person than other interventions – lowering its relative cost\-effectiveness. However, there were two exceptions to these recommendations: where malaria transmission is very low, the cost\-effectiveness of the vaccine is comparable to that of bed nets; and where malaria transmission is high, the vaccine is the best secondary intervention after bed nets.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 As a result of his advanced modelling on malaria transmission and intervention, Griffin has: 

#  Advised on international investment in antimalarial intervention – in the absence of WHO guidelines 

 By identifying the most cost\-effective combinations of malaria interventions – those that will achieve the greatest reductions in cases and deaths while being less logistically and financially demanding – Griffin’s work directly informed, advised, and optimised funding allocation for the Global Fund. The Global Fund is a leading global partnership that works to combat the malaria epidemic, provides 65% of all international funding, and distributed around USD4,000,000,000 to malaria control programmes in the 2017–2019 period \[5.1\]. Griffin and co\-workers’ cost\-benefit analysis of four malaria interventions \(bed nets, house spraying, seasonal drug treatment or vaccine\) enabled the Global Fund to strategically allocate its funding in 41 sub\-Saharan African countries to specific interventions in 2017–2019. This filled a vital knowledge gap; the Global Fund is typically guided by WHO recommendations, but guidance on whether to fund new interventions \(eg a vaccine\) or scale up existing measures did not exist in 2017. 

 According to Scott Filler, Leader of the Malaria Team at the Global Fund, Griffin's modelling “helped inform our understanding of the relative cost\-effectiveness of different antimalarial interventions, enabling us to understand which activities to approve for front\-line delivery to maximise the impact of available funding in preventing malaria” \[5.2\]. By confirming that bed nets, house spraying, and seasonal drug treatment should remain priorities across sub\-Saharan Africa, Griffin’s work “enabled the Global Fund to understand how to target funding, in the absence of external guidance, in a way that would otherwise have been impossible.” 

 Cost\-effectiveness was a key consideration in this strategic allocation of funding because total malaria funding was short of its target. Citing Griffin and coworkers’ findings on the progress of funding towards milestones \[5.3, 5.4\], the World Malaria Reports states that “overall, malaria funding in 2016 was only 41% of the 2020 milestone of US$ 6.5 billion, putting the 2020 milestones at great risk” \[5.3\]. 

#  Helped prevent up to 87,000 deaths and 27 million symptomatic cases of malaria 

 In Malawi alone, one of the most affected countries, over 12,000,000 bed nets have been distributed and house spraying targeted a population of 1,000,000 in 2019, resulting in an estimated 62% reduction in the number of cases in Mangochi District according to Alexander Chikonga, Chief of Party – Global Fund Grants from World Vision Malawi \[5.3\]. More generally, Griffin reapplied the methodology of \[3.5\] to evaluate what would have happened in 2017–2019 if the Global Fund had instead funded alternative anti\-malaria interventions. He found that by following Griffin and colleagues’ recommendations and scaling up coverage of bed nets \(by 197,000,000 nets\) and house spraying \(by 12,500,000 structures\), the Global Fund saved as many as 87,000 lives and reduced the number of additional malaria cases by up to 27,000,000 \(in 2017–2019\). Specifically: 

-  An estimated **23,000,000** more symptomatic cases and **82,000** additional deaths from malaria would have occurred if investment had focused on house spraying alone 

-  An estimated **27,000,000** more cases and **87,000** more deaths would have occurred if investment had focused on rollout of the RTS,S vaccine 

-  An estimated **2,500,000** more cases and **7,400** more deaths would have occurred if investment had focused on seasonal drug treatment \(in areas deemed suitable by the WHO\) 

 For context, the baseline 2017–2019 projections were 530,000,000 symptomatic cases and 2,200,000 deaths. 

#  Stimulated further essential research on the RTS,S vaccine 

 Following Griffin and coauthors’ findings on the complexities of comparing vaccine efficacy to existing anti\-malaria measures, a pilot programme for the RTS,S vaccine has begun in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi to investigate the vaccine’s cost\-effectiveness and duration of protection \[5.1\]. The World Malaria Report 2019 states “Through a WHO\-coordinated pilot progamme, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi recently introduced the world’s first malaria vaccine in selected areas. Evidence and experience from the programme will inform policy decisions on the vaccine’s potential wider use in Africa. With support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and from Unitaid, other promising tools are being tested, such as new types of insecticide\-treated nets and tools that target outdoor\-biting mosquitoes” \[5.5\], further showing the continued relevance of the work.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Banks\-Leite calculated that the Brazilian Atlantic Forest requires 30% of native habitat to preserve biodiversity \( *Science* 2014\). These results underpinned three environmental laws on: \(1\) offsetting practices in São Paulo State, prioritising areas for restoration in \(2\) Rio de Janeiro State and \(3\) across the entire Atlantic Forest. The latter prioritisation was performed by Mills \( *Nature Ecology and Evolut*ion 2018\) aiming to increase forest cover back to 30% in selected areas. Examples of behaviour change as a result of the legislation include: tree planting by Brazil’s 2<sup>nd</sup> busiest airport, a management plan for water resources and a collaboration between two government agencies to allocate funding for restoration. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2014, Banks\-Leite led the publication of a paper in *Science* showing there is an ecological threshold at 30% of forest cover, below which biodiversity and ecological functions become dramatically different to that of protected areas of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest **\[1\]**. This research was ground\-breaking because until then the majority of studies searching for a “minimum area required for sustaining biodiversity” had failed to obtain consistent responses among taxa and to generate a precise target for conservation and/or restoration. Banks\-Leite was able to circumvent these issues by using an innovative approach, which consisted of measuring: \(1\) forest cover at the landscape scale as a proxy for habitat changes and \(2\) community integrity and phylogenetic integrity as a proxy for biodiversity changes and ecological functions, respectively. Forest cover is a more parsimonious approach than the commonly employed measures of fragment size and patch\-scale connectivity, and it is often more strongly correlated to changes in species and communities. Integrity metrics measure similarity in forest fragments relative to continuous forests. This approach summarises community\-wide dynamics, hence it is more robust and pragmatic than measuring losses in single species or functions. Banks\-Leite then used a piecewise regression to estimate the breakpoint, and confidence intervals, associated with the existence of a threshold. 

 These findings were also used to estimate the costs of restoring priority areas. Banks\-Leite et al. calculated that an annual investment in Payment for Ecosystem Services \(PES\), and active reforestation practices \(i.e., watering seedlings\), worth U.S. $198 million per year would allow 37,000 priority landscapes to restore biodiversity to levels that matched protected areas **\[1, 2\]**. This cost corresponds to just 0.0092% of the Brazilian GDP, or 6.5% of what Brazil spends on agricultural subsidies. This is a “Highly Cited Paper” in Web of Science \(188 citations as of 18/12/20\), and it was featured in over 50  [interviews](https://veja.abril.com.br/videos/veja-ciencia/quanto-custa-preservar-a-mata-atlantica/),  [blogs](https://news.mongabay.com/2014/08/saving-the-atlantic-forest-would-cost-less-than-titanic/),  [magazines](https://www.newsweek.com/price-yacht-you-could-preserve-entire-ecosystem-267359),  [newspapers](https://sustentabilidade.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,areas-agricolas-da-mata-atlantica-poderiam-ser-recuperadas-por-menos-de-0-01-do-pib-anual,1551067) and  [government reports](http://www.rbma.org.br/anuariomataatlantica/pdf/anuario_2017.pdf). 

 Banks\-Leite’s 30% threshold was later used by Mills in a collaborative study to develop a restoration prioritisation for the Atlantic Forest. This prioritisation was commissioned by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment to guide the implementation of the Native Vegetation Protection Law and the National Policy for Native Vegetation Recovery, and it was later published on *Nature Ecology and Evolution* **\[3\]**. Mills and her colleagues developed a novel approach that incorporates ecological and economic efficiencies of scale and that takes into account multiple criteria, including whether forest cover is below 30% **\[1\]**. The final result of this restoration prioritisation is a priority map that prevents 26% of the biome’s current extinction debt of 2864 plant and animal species \(an increase of 257% compared to the baseline\), and sequesters 1 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents \(a 105% increase\) while reducing costs by US$ 28 billion \(a 57% decrease\) compared to business as usual approach.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Brazilian legislation requires landholders to set aside 20% of their farm for natural habitats in the Atlantic Forest biome, however the Science 2014 study **\[1\]** shows that this is not enough to protect biodiversity. This paper was the first to provide policymakers with a clear\-cut figure regarding “how much habitat is enough”, and drove the development of three policies: 

###  State level resolutions and impacts 

 1\) The Director of the Centre for Ecological Restoration within the Secretariat for the Environment of the State of São Paulo states that “ *After a water constraint in 2014, the State Government decided to remodel some rules of the existing offsetting policies, to make it more effective for both water provisioning and biodiversity conservation. The Banks\-Leite et al paper influenced the decision of: \(a\) prioritising restoration projects \[…\] and \(b\) setting higher offsetting standards \(for legally\-cut trees\) in municipalities that do not meet the minimum thresholds of remaining habitat.”* **\[A\]**. These new rules are part of Resolution SMA 7/2017 \(enacted in 2017\) **\[A\]**. 

 Implementation: 

 a\) São Paulo/Congonhas Airport expansion \(2017\) – The extension of Brazil’s second busiest airport required cutting trees. The environmental impact assessment produced for this development states that to comply with the Resolution SMA 7/2017, 1456 new trees will need to be planted to offset the environmental damage \( **\[B\]** page 11\). 

 b\) Centro de Disposição de Resíduos Pedreira \(2019\) – This landfill receives an average of 6,000 t/day of waste materials from São Paulo city and its expansion requires clearing a forested area of roughly 56,000 m<sup>2</sup> \(page 18\). Resolution SMA 7/2017 was used to determine that the company must restore a larger area elsewhere with an estimated cost of nearly R$60m to offset the environmental damage \( **\[C\]** page 18 **,** page 40\). 

 c\) Condomínio Habitacional Américo Barbosa \(2019\) – Housing development plans to build four 17\-storey buildings and will need to cut 63 trees. Thus 780 trees will need to be planted in a protected area nearby to comply with Resolution SMA 7/2017 \( **\[D\]** page 8\). 

 2\) In response to the same water shortage in 2014, the Rio de Janeiro State Institute of Environment published an Atlas of Water Resources to increase protection for headwaters and bodies of water within the state **\[E\]**. Their multi\-scale/multi\-criteria approach to identify priority areas for forest restoration used the same landscape scale as the Science 2014 paper **\[1\]** \(i.e., 200 ha, see Table \[Quadro\] 31\), and their decision on the high priority areas for reforestation \(Table \[Quadro\] 36, Map \[Mapa\] 14\) was directly based on the Science 2014 **\[1\]** \( **\[E\]** Page 136\). Banks\-Leite is cited in this report as one of the specialists who contributed to the report **\[E\]**. This prioritisation is now part of Resolution CERHI\-RJ Nº 218/2019 \(enacted in 2019\). 

 Implementation: 

 a\) Management Plan for Water Resources in the Baia de Guanabara – This technical report revised the current management plan given new laws \(including CERHI\-RJ Nº 218/2019\) and needs \( **\[F\]** page 17\). 

###  Federal level legalisation and impacts 

 3\) The results from the Science 2014 paper **\[1\]** were critical for defining an optimal restoration scenario to underpin the prioritisation undertaken by Mills and colleagues as published in Strassburg et al. \(2018\) **\[2\]**. This prioritisation is the official map used by the Brazilian Ministry of Environment to help support the Native Vegetation Protection Law \(Nº 12.651/2012\) and the National Policy for Native Vegetation Recovery \(nº 8.972/2017 enacted by Federal Decree in 2017\) **\[G\]**. The prioritisation uses Banks\-Leite’s 30% threshold alongside socio\-economic layers to select where reforestation should be prioritised and bring these areas back to 30% forest cover **\[G, H\]**. The deputy director of the Department for Conservation of Ecosystems within the Brazilian Ministry of Environment confirms that “ *the results from Banks\-Leite and colleagues \(2014\) were critical to define a restoration scenario where landscapes with at least 30% of forest cover can be reached through restoration.”* **\[H\]** 

 Implementation: 

 a\) Brazilian Ministry of Environment \(2017\) – This term of reference establishes the rules for hiring a consultant to elaborate strategies for increasing funding to promote restoration in four regions of the Atlantic Forest \( **\[I\]** page 1\). These regions were defined as priority areas by the restoration prioritisation undertaken by Mills. This Term of Reference cites the Decree nº 8.972/2017 as the main drive for the need to obtain more funding \( **\[I\]** page 3\). 

 b\) Partnership between Brasilia Ambiental and Banco do Brasil Foundation \(2020\) – These are two government agencies that have entered into a partnership to allocate funding to projects aiming to restore native habitats to comply with the Decree 8.972/2017 \( **\[J\]** page 1\). Banco do Brasil will provide the funding and Brasilia Ambiental will manage the grants \(e.g. R$20m to projects in the Distrito Federal State\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel researchers’ novel cloud\-based High Performance Simulation \(HPS\) techniques have enabled in this REF period: \(i\) at least 30 SMEs to develop new cloud\-based HPS products leading to around GBP13,000,000 increased turnover, \(ii\) Saker Solutions to increase their turnover to around GBP1,400,000 and delivering some GBP2,000,000,000 – GBP3,000,000  benefit to nuclear, manufacturing, defence and retail industries, \(iii\) a new cloud\-based nuclear waste reprocessing decision support system at Sellafield PLC Saker Solutions \(UK SME\) and \(iv\) a new startup \(CloudSME UG\).

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Computer simulation is widely used in manufacturing and logistics from new product design \(e.g. continuous simulation \( **CS**\) used mainly in product design \(efficiency of air flow over turbine blades, movement of oil in tankers, etc.\) to evaluating improvements in production and logistics \(e.g. discrete\-event simulation \( **DES**\) \(analysis of factory improvements, supply chain logistics, warehouse organisation, etc.\)\). Contemporary simulation software systems limit the amount of investigation/experimentation that can be done in a project, and therefore the quality of results \( **THEME1**\), and model size/reuse \( **THEME2**\). **THEME1**: **DES** until relatively recently no widespread approaches were used by commercial simulation vendors to speed up experimentation; **CS** simulation software is typically parallelised and uses multiple CPUs to speed up simulations; these need expensive computing clusters to run. **THEME2**: **DES** commercial simulations typically run on a single computer which limits model size. 

 **THEME1:DES/CS** \- cloud computing enable users to “hire” multiple computational resources that can significantly speed up simulation experimentation through parallel execution.  This can result in better results and decision making. Simulation software vendors are typically SMEs.  The development of cloud\-based High\-Performance Simulation \(HPS\) software is costly and this is a major barrier to innovation.  In the FP7 Cloud\-based Simulation platform for Manufacturing and Engineering \(CloudSME\) project \( [www.cloudsme.eu](http://www.cloudsme.eu/)\), research by Taylor/Anagnostou in collaboration with the project leader \(Kiss, Westminster\) and the CloudSME project team led to the development of the CloudSME Simulation Platform \(CSSP\) that enabled the rapid creation of commercial cloud\-based HPS software solutions on multiple clouds \(e.g., Amazon, Azure and European SME cloud providers such as CloudSigma, etc.\). Previous experience in HPS enabled Taylor/Anagnostou to bridge between commercial simulation application development with the technical development of the CSSP platform. Taylor/Anagnostou worked with the industrial partners to develop their new cloud\-based simulation applications and ensured that the CSSP would fully support these.  SMEs use the CSSP’s common API to create new cloud applications that can run on different clouds. This avoids potentially redevelopment costs when moving to another cloud and allows SMEs to exploit savings from the emerging worldwide cloud market.  Applications can be web\-based or desktop \( **REF3**, **REF6**\).  The Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application \(COLA\) project continued this work \(project\-cola.eu\) by leveraging advances in containerisation to produce the auto\-scaling Microservices\-based Cloud Application\-level Dynamic Orchestrator \(MiCADO\) service.  Taylor/Anagnostou worked with Kiss in the COLA project to produce JQueuer that augments MiCADO to enable the optimum use of cloud\-based resources in simulation experimentation via deadline scheduling \( **REF5**\). 

 **THEME2:DES** \- Large simulations can be composed from a set of linked new/existing smaller simulations running on multiple computers.  Taylor led international standardisation efforts with the US\-based Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization \(SISO\) to produce the world’s first standard in this area \(Standard for COTS Simulation Package Interoperability Reference Models \(SISO\-STD\-006\-2010\) \( **REF1**\). The common approach to interoperating simulations \(distributed simulation\) is specified in other standards.  However, these do not capture problems common to commercial simulation applications.  This research created methods and interoperability patterns that implemented these standards to enable large\-scale simulations consisting of new or reused models. **REF2** describes the methodology based on a non\-confidential case study. 

 Overall, this work has created a foundation for high performance simulation in industry by combining **THEME1** and **THEME2** \(see **REF4** for details on the overall “vision”\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research has had impact in many areas of manufacturing and logistics in terms of enabling better decisions through the use of faster experimentation \( **THEME1**\) and larger simulations \( **THEME2**\). It has therefore enabled \(i\) many commercial cloud\-based high\-performance simulation \(HPS\) systems, \(ii\) a major high\-performance simulation industrial application of large scale simulation and associated innovations, and \(iii\) contributions to standardisation. Overall, based on substantial industrial experience, the major impact of this work has been to create a foundation for future industrial high performance simulation systems by combining both themes. 

 **\(THEME1**\) The impact of cloud\-based HPS has been to enable vendors to create new products/services with a knock\-on impact to their clients through more detailed analyses within project timescales. A diverse range of applications include business process simulation, footwear design, emissions reduction, inventory management and freight transportation. Overall, the impact so far has been evidenced by 30 European SMEs from 12 countries that reported the following estimated economic impact as a result of this work: a cumulative turnover increase of approximately GBP13,000,000, leading to the development of around 150 new products or services in manufacturing & logistics and contributing to the creation of around 100 new jobs. Additionally, these companies reduced the time to market for new products and improved business processes, customer satisfaction and business practices. The above numbers are evidenced in official project reports/deliverables of the CloudSME and COLA projects submitted to the European Commission and provided by executives of the involved companies \( **E1, E2**\).  The CSSP is also being used in other large projects \(e.g. the H2020 Cloudifacturing project involving around 200 SMEs\).  These figures can be considered to be a lower bound. 

 The FP7 CloudSME project also led to the founding of CloudSME UG in 2015, a new start up to continue to develop new cloud\-based HPS \( **E3**\). With Taylor as a scientific advisor, the company now has 4 employees and an annual turnover of approximately GBP133,000 since 2017 \(primarily through contracts in manufacturing\) and made its first profit in 2019. The impact of Brunel’s work is further supported by two videos created for the European Commission that demonstrates the results of their ICT for Manufacturing SMEs \(I4MS\) programme \(CloudSME was funded under this\).  The video by Hobsons Brewery, a UK\-based SME craft\-brewer, shows how cloud\-based simulation made their business more efficient \( **E4**\).  The video by Podoactiva, a Spanish SME manufacturer of tailored foot insoles, shows how the technology enabled them to increase their market by enabling new insole design applications for podiatrists. These projects also enabled Saker Solutions, Hobsons Brewery and Taylor/Anagnostou to successfully bid for an InnovateUK project \(CraftBrew\) that facilitated the development of a low\-cost enterprise management system for small brewers. 

 \( **THEME1 and THEME2**\) Taylor/Anagnostou have worked with Saker Solutions \(SME, UK\) and Sellafield PLC to develop many discrete\-event simulations of nuclear waste reprocessing.  The impact of **THEME2** \(large models\) comes from training Saker to create large distributed simulations. Taylor/Anagnostou worked with Saker Solutions and Sellafield PLC to develop a distributed simulation of the Magnox Swarf Storage Silo \(MSSS\) system. This is the only distributed simulation used in the nuclear industry \( **E6**\).  This reuses and links six previously developed simulations to form a large\-scale simulation of nuclear waste recycling in this area.  SAKERGRID, a high\-performance simulation system previously developed with Taylor to manage and deploy simulation experiments on a computing cluster \(and now cloud\) has been significantly extended through the above research and deployed at both Saker and Sellafield \( **THEME1**\).  This has led to an increased turnover at Saker of GBP1,400,000 since 2014 with some GBP2,000,000 – GBP3,000,000 of benefit mainly to the nuclear industry \(Sellafield\) but also manufacturing, defence and retail sectors. In addition, there are unquantified savings arising from the reduced turnaround time of experimentation enabled by the use of SAKERGRID which both reduces project lead time and increases the number of scenarios which can be examined.  The upgrading of SAKERGRID to cloud also enabled Saker to continue working effectively during the COVID pandemic \( **E7**\).

 1. Summary of the impact 

 The Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime \(ESYTC\) had two main impacts: \(i\) it was the primary evidence\-base underpinning the introduction of radical legislation that increased the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland from 8 to 12; and \(ii\) it formed the evidence\-base for two new youth justice strategies: the Scottish Prison Service’s ‘Vision for Young People in Custody’ and the Scottish Government’s ‘Youth Justice Strategy 2015\-20’, which together led to substantial reductions in the number of young people being convicted \(34% fall since 2015\) and sent to prison \(45% fall since 2015\) – the lowest figures since 1972. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The ESYTC is a prospective longitudinal study of pathways into and out of offending amongst a cohort of approximately 4,300 young people who started secondary education in the City of Edinburgh in 1998. Data collection for this case study occurred between 1998 and 2012. It is the biggest UK\-based criminological life\-course study and one of few world\-wide that includes both girls and boys in its cohort. 

 Sources of data on the cohort include: repeated self\-report questionnaires; semi\-structured interviews with sub\-samples of the cohort; data from official records \(police, social work, juvenile justice, criminal conviction, schools\); a parents’ survey; a pastoral teachers’ survey; and a geographic information system based on census data and police recorded crime. 

 The key findings based on analysis of ESYTC data by McAra and McVie that support this case study are: 

-  Offending behaviour in the teenage years is common; however, only a very small proportion of young people become persistent and serious offenders \(3.1\). 

-  Persistent and serious offenders typically come from impoverished family backgrounds, live in deprived neighbourhoods, and experience a range of adversities and vulnerabilities during childhood and adolescence \(3.2\). 

-  Experience of poverty and early system intervention in early childhood are significant predictors of offending in adolescence and criminal conviction in early adulthood \(3.3\). 

-  Educational exclusion is highly damaging to young people’s life chances and is one of the best predictors of later imprisonment \(3.3\). 

-  Early adverse childhood experiences serve to capture and retain young people in the justice system and, despite wider societal change in which offending has declined, these individuals continue to be recycled around the justice system with deleterious effects \(3.4\). 

-  Where a young person does end up in custody, positive outcomes can occur when the regime is predicated on an educational model of care as well as strong and supportive relationships between young people and their key workers \(3.4\). 

-  In recent years, youth crime has been displaced away from the street into cyberspace, but there is an increasing concentration of poor, marginalised and vulnerable young people in our youth and adult justice systems \(3.4\). 

-  Keeping young offenders out of the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems for as long as possible reduces their risk of further offending and repeated justice system intervention \(3.5\). 

-  Repeated justice system contact perpetuates cycles of poverty and leads to inequality in terms of educational exclusion and disadvantage, poor labour market outcomes, poor physical and mental health \(including suicidal ideation\), relationship breakdown and social isolation \(3.5, 3.6\). 

-  Diversion from formal justice measures and minimal intervention are more effective in tackling serious and persistent youth offending, and supporting pathways out of offending, than intensive and punitive interventions \(3.5, 3.6\). 

 Taken together, these findings are strongly supportive of policies that avoid the criminalisation of young people through increasing the age of criminal responsibility to internationally agreed minimum standards; diverting young people from formal criminal justice measures \(especially imprisonment\) where possible; and developing policies of educational inclusion.

 4. Details of the impact 

 \(i\) Raising the age of criminal responsibility \(ACR\) in Scotland 

 The Age of Criminal Responsibility \(Scotland\) Act 2019 marked a radical change in juvenile justice and brought Scotland more into line with international human rights standards than other UK jurisdictions. ESYTC formed the underpinning evidence for this change, as stated in the Policy Memorandum accompanying the Bill when introduced to Parliament \(5.1\). 

 Legislative change was initiated by a Scottish Government Advisory Group on ACR, established in 2016, which extensively used ESYTC findings to inform debate and support its recommendation to raise ACR to 12 \(5.2\). Robert Marshall \(Chair of the Scottish Government Advisory Group\) stated: *“\[The ESYTC\] provided us with solid evidence on which we based our discussions, playing a significant part in informing and guiding the thoughts of the Advisory Group in order to make recommendations that the law be changed”* \(5.3\) *.* Paul Carberry \(Advisory Group member and Director of Action for Children Scotland\) stated: *“There is no doubt the study by McAra and McVie has been the most influential academic research into youth justice in the 30 years I have been working in this area. The findings significantly influenced the approach to working with young people in trouble to the significant benefit of many thousands of children and young people in Scotland…\[T\]he research findings were widely drawn upon and provided an important benchmark for a group of advisors from different professional backgrounds”* \(5.4\) *.* 

 An independent inquiry was launched by Action for Children and the Scottish Children’s Commissioner to feed evidence into the Advisory Group. McAra and McVie were key contributors \(5.5\). Richard Holloway \(Chair of the inquiry\) stated: *“The evidence from the \[ESYTC\] was enormously helpful in our work and was hugely influential to our thinking…Their findings have demonstrated convincingly that criminalising children is not only wrong, it is counterproductive. Professors McAra and McVie can claim credit not only for this significant change in policy, but also for providing irrefutable evidence that the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland, currently set at 8 years of age, is both morally and empirically unsupportable. And the Edinburgh Study was undoubtedly one of the key catalysts behind the current Bill”* \(5.6\). 

 A Scottish Parliament Information Centre Briefing Paper on the Bill heavily cited the ESYTC in support of raising ACR \(5.7\); and McVie gave expert evidence to a Parliamentary Committee \(5.8.a\), which was debated by MSPs during passage of the Bill through Parliament \(5.8.b\). 

 \(ii\) Youth Justice Strategy 

 In December 2014, the Scottish Prison Service \(SPS\) published its ‘Vision for Young People in Custody’, a strategy aimed at ensuring that time spent in custody by young people should “enable them to prepare for a positive future” \(5.9.a\). The Professional Advisor for the Young People’s Strategy with the SPS stated: *“Evidence from the Edinburgh Study provided an essential part of the evidence base for design of the SPS strategy and has continued to inform thinking during the implementation stages”* \(5.9.b\); and further noted: *“It is very important that staff who work with young people in custody understand this evidence, to combat any misconceptions and to give them a sound base from which to undertake their role in supporting the young people to prepare for a positive future. Messages from the Study have been incorporated into staff training and development”* \(5.9.b\). 

 ESYTC findings also formed the basis of the Scottish Government’s national ‘Youth Justice Strategy 2015\-20’, aimed at improving life chances for children and young people up to age 21. According to the Strategy: *“Findings from the \[ESYTC\] tell us that: serious offending is linked to a broad range of vulnerabilities and social adversity; early identification of at\-risk children runs the risk of labelling and stigmatising; pathways out of offending are affected by critical moments in the early teenage years. In particular, school inclusion and diversionary strategies facilitate the desistance process. This strategy is founded on a shared commitment to dealing with the issues raised by that evidence”* \(5.10.a\). 

 Following implementation of these strategies, national statistics on Criminal Proceedings in the Scottish Courts published by the Scottish Government showed major reductions in the number of young people aged under 21 entering the criminal justice system. This included a 34% reduction in convictions in the Scottish Courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19 \(5.10.b\) and a 45% reduction in imprisonment between 2014/15 and 2019/20 \(5.10.c\). These are the lowest numbers since comparable records began in 1972 \(5.10.d\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The TESS\-India \(Teacher Education through School\-based Support in India\) project was designed to to strengthen and transform professional development and classroom practice in seven target states in India. Through the use of Open Education Resources \(OERs\) and the embedding of ‘localised’ practices TESS\-India provided a sustainable and scalable approach to pre\- and in\-service teacher education, with an emphasis on inclusive, participatory, child\-centred pedagogy. This delivered: i\) an impact on **public policy** through the endorsement of the use of TESS\-India OERs in teacher education programmes by seven state governments in India and by influencing approaches to professional development of six non\-governmental organisations in India, Ghana, and Uzbekistan and ii\) an **impact on the understanding and learning** of over one million trainee teachers, teachers and teacher educators by developing their understanding of active learning. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The need to improve elementary and secondary school classroom practices across India to raise standards of student achievement is well documented. It is widely acknowledged that there is a need to develop child\-centred practices that position children as active learners. The urgency of this challenge in India has demanded approaches to teacher education and professional learning which can lead to systemic change in classroom practices that is both sustainable and scalable. The TESS\-India project aimed to address this challenge and improve the quality of both teacher education and classroom practices across seven states in India \(Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Utter Pradesh and West Bengal\). 

 The TESS\-India approach to addressing this challenge was initially informed by action research undertaken in Africa between 2008 and 2015. Researchers tested their working hypotheses \(Theory of Change\) that teaching and learning materials that are freely available and easily adaptable \(OERs\) could be used to shift the pedagogic practices of teachers and teacher educators if collaborative structures and practices were put in place to enable teachers to adapt and share the OERs for/in their local contexts. Action research examined the practices drawn on in the localisation of OERs. The implications of these localisation practices for subsequent use of the OERs were examined, along with ways in which the OERs could be successfully integrated into teacher education programmes. For example, the disruption of theory\-based pre\- and in\-service programmes through the use of OERs in eight primary schools across four countries in Sub Saharan Africa was examined in one study. The research evidenced: a lack of clarity in how relationships between practice and theory are understood and the implications of this for teaching within teacher education programmes; individual beliefs and values that created barriers to offering student teachers and teachers an understanding of theory and practice as a duality; how local teacher educators and teachers acted to broker pedagogic change within their institutions and linked schools **\[O1\]**. An analysis of the factors influencing OER adaptation by educators revealed that many educators were reluctant to publicly modify the work of others and difficulties in convincing educators of the validity of their local knowledge which would justify modification of OERs **\[O2\]**. Another study focused on teacher education institutions by exploring how and when teacher educators engage with OERs and factors that support, constrain and sustain the development of productive educator identities with OERs such that pedagogy is transformed. Analysis of data drawn from 58 survey respondents, 36 teacher\-educator interviews and six institutional stake\-holder interviews indicated fragmentary understanding of OERs, dissonances between ways in which individuals use OERs and dominant institutional values and discourses and the structural and cultural factors which act to limit agency with regard to OER use. But for some educators, OERs provided a tool for extending their agency to move towards more participatory practices and this was enhanced by social capital from ‘belonging’ to extended networks **\[O3\]**. 

 The refinement and expansion of the TESS\-India approach was informed by action research that took place in India, in collaboration with key TESS\-India beneficiaries between 2015 and 2017. Research sought to understand localisation processes and experiences in the Indian context and to explore the potential of MOOCs to enable a scalable approach to pedagogical change in classroom practices. For example, the effectiveness of a large\-scale MOOC deployed by the TESS\-India project was critically analysed **\[O4\]**. Analysis of MOOC platform data, a pre\-course survey of 27,000 participants, a post\-course survey of 18,500 participant and observations of MOOC facilitators indicated that MOOCs have potential, in less economically developed contexts, to target the skills and capabilities of specific groups of professionals, but that their success demands careful attention to the provision of an enabling structure that opens possibilities for teachers to generate their own solutions to issues of access and support alongside what was formerly provided. In another study, a mixed methods approach involving interviews with 36 ‘localisers’ \(teachers and teacher educators\), analysis of localisation workshop reports and state endorsed reports was employed to explore the practice of those involved in TESS\-India localisation and the ways local actors devised for dealing with this activity. This identified the importance of teacher agency and the barriers to the exercising of this agency **\[O5\]**. 

 Overall, the research revealed four important messages for stakeholders who have a responsibility for developing sustainable and scalable approaches to transforming classroom practice of primary and secondary school teachers: 

1.  Teacher education programmes can drive pedagogical change in schools and sustain it using OER and MOOCs \- shifting how theory is used in practice. Teacher educators play a key brokerage role across communities, as do teachers within schools. 

1.  Key success factors for the integration of OERs into teaching practice are the accommodation of local cultural and institutional practices and the agency of teachers in determining OER use. 

1.  It is important for teachers to be supported to adapt OERs to their local contexts through tools and processes that create communities and identity. 

1.  External networks are valuable in supporting educators to use OER to transform practice.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The TESS\-India project was designed to strengthen and transform professional development and classroom practice in seven target states in India: Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Utter Pradesh and West Benghal.  At the core of the TESS\-India approach was an Open Educational Resources toolkit to support the professional practice\-based learning of primary and secondary teachers of Literacy, Maths, English and Science \(www.tess\-india.edu.in\). In addition to the toolkit, a six\-week task\-based MOOC was designed which utilised a ‘hybrid’ support model combining online support through course forums with face\-to\-face support through regular contact sessions in the seven target states across India. 

 The key beneficiaries of the TESS\-India Project are: State Resource Groups comprising teacher educators, leading teachers and teaching education stakeholders; teacher educators in District Institutes of Education and Training \(DIETS\) and local teacher advisers \(called Block Resource Coordinators \(BRCs\) or Cluster Resource Centre Coordinators \(CRCCs\)\). The TESS\-India project team has worked with these key beneficiaries in order to: 1\) write, refine, prepare, film, translate and localise the OERS within the toolkit. 2\) persuade each state government \(State Council of Education, Research and Training \- SCERT\) to officially approve the materials and mandate their use 2\) identify opportunities to embed the materials in teacher educator programmes across India 3\) identify NGO partners to collaborate with in order to extend the reach of TESS\-India in teacher education programmes. 

 The overall outcome of this work with beneficiaries is that 26,028 sets of OER have been distributed as print, SD card, CD/DVD and pen drives. The TESS India Massive Online Open Course \(MOOC\) has extended the reach and impact of the TESS\-India approach enhancing digital literacies and building teacher communities. Through 2015\-17, two iterations of the TESS\-India MOOC \(in Hindi and English\) attracted over 43,000 registrations, with approximately 95% of these from India including the 7 target states, and with a completion rate of over 50% \(higher than the average of 12% for MOOC completion\) **\[C1\]**. Data from the TESS\-India YouTube channel indicates that there were 13,700 subscribers and over 3 million views \(26/11/20\). More specifically, the TESS\-India project has had an impact on: 

1.  **public policy** through the endorsement of the use of TESS\-India OERs in teacher education programmes by state governments and by influencing approaches of non\-governmental organisations in and beyond India to teacher professional development. 

1.  **the understanding and learning** of trainee teachers, teachers and teacher educators by developing their understanding of active learning. 

 The scale and quality of this impact has been recognised through two major awards. In 2015, TESS\-India won the Bond Innovation award, with judges commenting how the project was using ‘innovation through decentralisation to address a stubborn challenge. In March 2017, TESS\-India was awarded the Guardian University Award 2017 in the ‘International Projects’ category. The judges gave the following comments in support of their decision: “ *We think this project is outstanding in its innovative and impactful teaching and learning approach. In terms of impact, the initiative contributes to development of new forms of teacher education, using web based, globally available technology*”. 

 **Influenced teacher education policy through state endorsement of TESS\-India OERs.** 

 The success of TESS\-India OERs and MOOC has led to changes in public policy, specifically how teacher education is conceptualised and delivered in key states in India –moving away from cascade models towards professional learning, situated in the school classroom and supported by various local experts. A 2018 independent evaluation of TESS\-India activity concluded that it has demonstrated an “ *innovative and path\-breaking approach to professional development of the teacher community*’ and ‘ *it has been successful in influencing teacher education activity in alignment with the current thinking in the country”* **\[C1\]**. State endorsement of TESS\-India approaches to teacher education can be evidenced by the inclusion of specific TESS\-India activities in Teacher Education Annual Work Plan and Budgets which SCERTS submit to the National Ministry for approval and once approved are then transformed into ‘Orders’. For example in Madhya Pradesh, following government approval, the SCERT issued orders in 2016 and 2017 to use the TESS\-India OER in all Teacher Education Institutions and purchased micro\-SD cards containing the TESS\-India OERs for all 286,000 elementary teachers at a cost of 1,432 lakhs \(approximately GBP1.5 million\) **\[C2\]**. In Utter Pradesh, the activities agreed in the 2015/16 Annual Work Plan included capacity building of all teachers and teacher educators on the use of the OER and three training programmes utilising the TESS\-India OERs were incorporated into the pre\-service curriculum for courses offered by 75 DIETs \(District Institutes of Education and Training\) in the state reaching 10,00 teachers and teacher educators per year **\[C3\]**. Four states \(Assam, Odisha, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh\) have integrated the TESS\-India OER into pre\-service programmes which are using the resources for lesson planning, practice teaching and project work.  In five states \(Assam, Odisha, West Bengal, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh\) the TESS\-India OER have been integrated into large\-scale in\-service teacher education programmes **\[C1\]**. In Bihar, in addition to embedding the OER materials in a 2\-year pre\-service teacher education programme the OER have been mapped to four set textbooks to aid teacher use of the OER **\[C4\]**. 

 **Influenced approaches of NGOs to teacher professional development** 

 The TESS\-India OER have been utilised by several NGOs and community organisations in their work with teachers. For example, in 2015, STIR \(an NGO working across India and Uganda\) integrated the materials into a project with teachers designed to improve teacher motivation through the use of micro\-innovations in their classrooms **\[C5\]**. In July 2015 TESS\-India materials were also integrated into a training module for 100 UNICEF ‘intervention schools’ that was designed to promote student\-centred and activity\-based learning in classrooms **\[C6\]**. The National University for Educational Planning and Administration has integrated the Tess\-India Leadership OER into the national programme for school leadership training to support ontological shifts in practice \(February 2014\) **\[C7\]**. In 2020 the OU entered into a collaboration agreement with the large Indian NGO, Gurushala, to develop an online course based on the TESS\-India materials. The course is called ‘Teaching English in Secondary School’ and there are 4 modules, each with 12 hours of teacher learning. Beyond India, the TESS\-India OER are heavily utilised in the ‘Transforming Teacher Education and Learning \(T\-TEL\) programme which aims to transform programmes of initial teacher education in all public colleges of Education in Ghana. TESS\-India resources are incorporated into training materials for College Tutors and handbooks to guide Student Teachers during their three teaching practice periods. T\-TEL was highlighted in the DFID Education Policy \(2018\) for its high quality open digital teaching resources **\[C8\]**. Finally, funded by the Global Partnership for Education’s Knowledge and Innovation Exchange \(KIX\), a teacher professional development programme in Ghana, Honduras and Uzbekistan is adapting the TESS\-India model \(2020\) **\[C9\]**. 

 **Developed trainee teachers’, teachers’ and teacher educators’ understandings of active learning** 

 The TESS\-India OER have reached over 1 million teachers across 7 states in India through a variety of means **\[C1\]** including: micro\-SD cards distributed to 286,000 teachers in Madhya Pradesh; state sponsored school improvement programmes such as ‘Shaala Saddhi’ in Madhya Pradesh involving 25,000 schools; within in\-service programmes delivered by the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan \(SSA\) focussing on 10,000 Maths and Science teachers in Odisha and 170,000 Maths, Science and English teachers in Madhya Pradesh and the use of TESS\-India Language and Literacy OER with 235,000 elementary teachers in the Padha Bharat Badhe Bharat \(Storytelling\) initiative in Madhya Pradesh as part of a national early reading directive. Evidence indicates that engagement with the OERs has had a significant impact on classroom teachers understanding of how to engage children in active learning experiences. For example, 2018 data from videos, classroom observations, lesson plans and interviews with a sample of 21 pre\-service teachers, teachers and teacher educators in Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Bihar indicate changes in classroom practices where teachers are utilising activities and drawing on ideas from the TESS\-India OERs **\[C10\]**. All the practitioners report changes in their own practices through generating lesson plans with a wider range of activities for their pupils involving new, creative uses of different locally available resources.  For example, one teacher from Odisha said: *“By using the key resources students became active and took interest to share questions. There was less gap between pupils and me. It gives me more ideas to make my class more creative and successful”.* Furthermore, the whole sample consistently talked about how these changes had led to greater pupil engagement indicating that they understood how changes in their practice impacted directly on the active learning of the children. Comments include: “ *Students attendance is getting better day by day due to their interest with the introduction of TESS\-India materials”*; “ *Children are not scared to talk to the teachers as they were before*” and “ *The materials help in arousing children’s curiosity and allows them to do things as it encourages teachers to conduct activities’* and ‘ *the child’s fear of the teacher has gone away through the strategies suggested in the OERs and videos”*. The TESS\-India model for systemic change centres on relational change in the practice of teacher educators and teachers. Movement in the practice of teacher educators is therefore important for sustainable change. DIET faculty have used the resources extensively in their pre\-service teacher training and encouraged student teachers to use the resources for lesson planning, practice teaching as well in their project work. One outcome of this is that, informed by their observations of student teachers, teacher educators have enhanced their own understanding of active learning. For example, one teacher educator from Madhya Pradesh shared: *“The \[...\] techniques seen in the videos have influenced my thinking and led to a lot of change in me. It has changed the way I had previously thought classrooms should be like and I looked at them differently. I also realized that I needed to change a lot as a Teacher Educator”* **\[C10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Evaluations of sporting and cultural events historically focused on economic consequences. Interdisciplinary research in economics, geography and environmental planning at Cardiff led to the adoption of an event impact evaluation methodology that identifies linkages between economic and environmental impacts. The research transformed how policy\-makers, event organisers and consultants understand and evaluate event environmental impacts. It underpinned the environmental section of the ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit from UK Sport \(the UK’s high\-performance sports agency\), the widespread adoption of which led to the staging of more sustainable events in five continents. It also influenced the development and scope of the first International Sustainability Standard for Golf Tournaments, which certified major tournaments in the US, Italy, and China. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Business cases for hosting major sporting and cultural events, which often rely upon public funding, traditionally focus on economic impacts. This neglects to consider that such events can also bring significant adverse environmental impacts. To address this, an interdisciplinary Cardiff team analysed the environmental consequences of tourism consumption at major events. 

 The research, supported through Research Council \(ESRC and AHRC\) funding, highlighted the growing importance of assessing linkages between the economic and environmental consequences of event development and resulting visitor impact in event business management and planning. 

 **2.1 Combining environmental and economic assessments to evaluate sporting events** 

 There has historically been a shortage of assessment tools \(and benchmark evidence\) to evaluate the environmental impact of events. In response, the Cardiff research team integrated existing methods from geography and environmental planning with economic approaches in order to assess both the environmental and economic impacts of events **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. Methods used included i\) Environmental Input\-Output Analysis \(ENVIO\), traditionally used to examine the economic consequences of events, but more recently expanded to take into account linked environmental effects; and ii\) Ecological Footprint \(EF\), used to assess resource use and measure its environmental impact. Collins and Flynn had previously applied the EF at a sub\-national level \(the city of Cardiff\) **\[3.4\]**. 

 In 2004, the research team was the first to use both methodologies to evaluate a major sporting event \(the FA Cup Final at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium\). This research: 

-  showed that direct and indirect environmental emissions could be estimated through the assessment of tourism spending linked to events **\[3.1\]**; 

-  identified the types of visitor spending which generated the most significant environmental impacts – particularly event\-related travel and food and drink consumption **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**; 

-  highlighted how changes to travel behaviour \(e.g. reducing air and car travel\) could significantly reduce the environmental impacts of events **\[3.2\]**. 

 The researchers recommended that this combined approach should be used in event impact evaluation as it enables practical consideration of both environmental and economic impacts **\[3.1, 3.3\]**. They further assessed and compared the economic and environmental impacts of three major sporting events – the FA Cup Final \(Cardiff, 2004\), a Six Nations rugby fixture \(Cardiff, 2006\) and the Tour de France Grand Départ \(London, 2007\). This research: 

-  identified specific policy\-amenable drivers that influence the scale of events’ environmental impacts. This includes visitor numbers, spending/consumption patterns, travel distance and mode, length of stay and event duration **\[3.5\]**; 

-  found that visitor profiles and spending patterns differed across events, resulting in varying economic and environmental impacts and a different composition of impacts; 

-  highlighted the need for future *ex ante* studies predicting event impacts to recognise the impact that different visitor types can have on spending/consumption patterns and resulting environmental consequences **\[3.2, 3.5\]**. 

 **2.2 Extending the research to assess the environmental impacts of cultural events** 

 The team extended the scope of the research to examine use of the EF as a method for assessing the environmental impacts of cultural events and festivals, as well as evaluating scenarios to reduce negative environmental impacts **\[3.6\]**. Research carried out at the Hay Literature Festival \(over 100,000 visitors\) **\[3.6\]**: 

-  found that the significant resource demands and environment impacts of festivals \(in particular visitor travel by car and air\) are comparable to major sporting events; 

-  identified that the environmental impacts of events are linked to visitor numbers, geographical location and services available in the host area \(public transport services, availability of overnight accommodation and food and drink outlets\); 

-  recommended that strategies to reduce the negative environmental impact of the festival require a more radical change in how visitors travel and an enhanced understanding of factors influencing visitor travel choices. 

 Overall, this body of research identified how event evaluations can effectively assess the environmental, as well as economic impacts of major sporting and cultural events.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff research identified how methodologies could be combined to assess the environmental, as well as economic impacts of major sporting and cultural events. Adoption of this approach nationally and internationally changed how policymakers, event organisers and consultants understand the potentially adverse environmental impacts of events. 

 This transformed impact evaluations of events and informed planning, policies and actions through: 

1.  underpinning the environmental section of UK Sport’s ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit. Since 2017, the widespread adoption of this toolkit resulted in the staging of more sustainable events in the UK and across five continents; 

1.  establishing an international best practice standard for evaluating event environmental impacts, through the Golf Environment Organisation Foundation. 

 **4.1 Transforming event impact evaluations** 

 UK Sport \(the government agency responsible for investing in Olympic and Paralympic sports in the UK\) first developed the ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit in 2008 to standardise event impact methodologies. The toolkit is run on a collaborative basis between UK Sport and partners, including: the Department of Culture, Media and Sport; Discover Northern Ireland; Event Scotland; and the Welsh Government. 

 A lack of understanding of, and appropriate tools for, evaluation in this version meant that event organisers using it were giving limited attention to the wider impacts of events. When updating the toolkit in 2016/17, Lucy Crickmore \(Major Events Consultant at UK Sport\) stated that the agency “ *wanted the event sector to go beyond economic impacts when setting objectives for their events and calculating their impacts*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 The Cardiff research team was invited to revise the environmental section of the toolkit. Crickmore stated that “ *partners specifically wanted to work with Dr. Andrea Collins and Prof. Max Munday at Cardiff University… due to their research expertise in evaluating events and their environmental impacts*” **\[5.1\]**. The Cardiff team’s redevelopment of the environment section of the toolkit and associated resources, based on **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5\]** included: 

-  the case for measuring the environmental impact of events; 

-  guidance on which environmental impacts should be considered; 

-  specific cases studies \(based on their own research\) demonstrating methodological approaches and measurement tools **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. 

 The ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit is now used extensively by UK Sport to enhance understanding of event environmental impacts and transform event impact evaluations. Crickmore stated that UK Sport “ *specifically uses the toolkit when making financial decisions on which events to support”* and signpost organisations to the environmental section of ‘eventIMPACTS’ “ *to determine how they might undertake their own research and a broader evaluation of environmental impacts”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2 Staging more sustainable sporting and cultural events** 

 Around 3,000 individuals and organisations in the UK and across Europe, Australia, South America, Asia and Africa have registered to use the transformed toolkit. In 2017, Collins and Munday collaborated with UK Sport to undertake a survey of these registered toolkit users. The 50 responses showed that ‘eventIMPACTS’ had been used to assess the economic and environmental impacts of sporting and cultural events by a wide range of organisations \(including businesses, not\-for\-profits, consultants, event organisers and governments\) across 13 countries worldwide \(England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, Serbia, Cyprus, Singapore, Australia, South Africa, and Columbia **\[5.3\]**. 

 The toolkit had informed planning decisions, policies and actions, and led to the staging of more sustainable events, as reported by users in the survey **\[5.4\].**  For example, the survey found that 47% of organisations strongly agree it enhanced their understanding of event environmental impacts and their evaluation; and 53% of organisations strongly agree it advanced their thinking about how to reduce these impacts. For example, John Coxeter\-Smith \(CEO of Sagacity Management Consultancy Services\) described ‘eventIMPACTS’ as an “ *invaluable*” resource for the Panamanian Government and Panama City Government: *We are confident, that it has at least opened Government ‘minds’ and hopefully enhanced … \[their\] understanding of the wider environmental impacts of the \[2022 Central American and Caribbean\] Games and beyond the Games, methodologies for assessing impacts and indicators they might use*” **\[5.4\]**. The Games will involve 6,000 athletes from 37 nations. 

 The survey also found that 22 organisations responding to the survey have directly used resources from the environmental section of ‘eventIMPACTS’ to inform event planning and operation decisions; and 27% have reduced the negative environmental impact of their events as a result of using the toolkit. For example, Clare Hartley \(Director of ARC Events Consultancy\) stated that the UK’s National School Games “ *found the case studies and guidance on measuring \[environmental\] impact invaluable, specifically on food and drink and reducing waste”* **\[5.5\]**. As a result, the Games *“reduced single use plastic water bottles by more than 50%, from 55,000 in 2017 to 20,000 in 2018”;* and significantly changed its branding policy; “ *Previously we spent about £120,000 on branding, last year we spent £50,000 as we reuse so much more. We have been able to reduce costs, but also reduce waste*” **\[5.5\]**. 

 The research also changed event planning decisions and reduced CO2e \(carbon dioxide equivalent\) emissions of major annual events in Wales. Between 2017 and 2019, the research team collaborated with Run4Wales, organisers of the Cardiff Half Marathon \(20,000 participants and 65,000 spectators\), and the National Eisteddfod \(45,000 visitors\) to apply the measurement tools and guidance from the environmental section of ‘eventIMPACTS’. Surveys at both events in 2017 provided new information on visitor profiles, their travel behaviour and its associated environmental impact and factors influencing travel choices. In 2018, organisers of both events used this research to inform event planning decisions and encourage more sustainable travel choices **\[5.6\]**. 

 A joint report by the research team and Run4Wales showed resulting changes to travel patterns and a 49% reduction in CO2e travel\-related emissions at the Cardiff Half Marathon **\[5.7\]**. An 18% reduction in CO2e travel\-related emissions was achieved at the National Eisteddfod **\[5.8\]**. Matt Newman, CEO of Run4Wales, stated that the underpinning research *“greatly enhanced our understanding of runner spending activities and their environmental impact*”; enabled them to be *“better equipped to minimise the environmental impact of our race catalogue*”; “ *make real progress towards staging a more sustainable race*”; and directly informed the scope of their first Environmental Policy and Green Action Plan **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.3 Environmental event impact evaluations for international golf tournaments** 

 In 2016, Cardiff research influenced the development and scope of the first International Sustainability Standard for Golf Tournaments via the Golf Environment Organisation Foundation \(GEO\) Expert Group. GEO is a not\-for\-profit that supports the international golf community to embrace sustainability. A group consisting of nine members wrote the Standard, with Collins as the sole academic representing the Cardiff research in event environmental impact evaluations **\[5.9\]**. Jonathan Smith, CEO of GEO, stated: *“your expertise and knowledge…was invaluable in developing the criteria, scope and guidance for the new Golf Tournaments International Voluntary Sustainability Standard”* **\[5.10\]**. The research informed the scope of the new Standard and was subsequently incorporated as mandatory criteria for achieving GEO® Tournament Certification **\[5.9, 5.10\]**. 

 Smith stated: “ *The Standard has changed how GEO, the golf industry and tournament organisers consider the environmental impacts of golf tournaments, specifically in relation to the scope of a tournaments carbon footprint, spectator travel and sustainable food and drink*” **\[5.10\]**. The credibility of the standard also led to the following direct strategic impacts **\[5.10\]**: 

-  it has accelerated sustainability in golf and through golf; 

-  raised awareness of the importance and need to address environmental and social sustainability at professional and amateur golf events; 

-  raised expectations within the industry to meet the Standard; 

-  accelerated sustainability commitments; 

-  elevated other tournaments to be more comprehensive by broadening their scope and deepening the delivery. 

 Since the launch of the Tournament Standard in 2017, Smith notes: “ *six major golf tournaments have achieved GEO® certification including RBC Heritage \(US, 2017\); Waste Management Phoenix Open \(US, 2017, 2018 and 2019\) \(the world’s largest golf tournament with 720,000 spectators\); the US Kids Venice Open \(Italy, 2018 and 2019\); Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational \(US, 2019\) \(with 35,000 spectators\) and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro\-Am \(US, 2019\) \(with 150,000 spectators\) and…The Foshian Open \(China, 2019\) \- the first tournament in the Asia Pacific”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 Two further major tournaments have also committed to working towards certification, CJ Cup \(South Korea\) and AT&T Byron Nelson \(US\), and twelve tournaments \(in US, Europe, Asia and South Africa\) are using the Standard as a guide to implement sustainability **\[5.10\]**. The Standard is also directly informing the International Olympic Committee for Olympic Sports **\[5.10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The University of Bristol developed world\-first radar\-based cancer detection system has been commercialised by spin\-out Micrima and is now being sold and being used in hospitals. Current screening technology for breast cancer involves exposure to ionising X\-ray radiation \(itself a potential cause of cancer\) and uncomfortable compression of the breast \- many women choose not to attend their 3 yearly screenings and this very treatable disease tragically remains one of the most common causes of death in women. The University of Bristol approach avoids both ionising radiation and discomfort. 

 Since 2014, Micrima Ltd has received over GBP14 million of investment to commercialise the technology and now employs 25 staff. Having received CE product approval and signed a distribution agreement with multinational Hologic Ltd, its first commercial imaging systems were ordered and shipped to hospitals in mainland Europe in the summer of 2020, where they are now in routine use with patients.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women between the ages of 35 and 49 in the UK**Footnote:**

 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health\-profile\-for\-england/chapter\-2\-major\-causes\-of\-death\-and\-how\-they\-have\-changed 
. National breast screening programmes, using X\-ray mammography, are the front\-line weapon in the fight to improve breast cancer survival statistics. 

 X\-ray equipment is bulky, expensive, and involves potentially harmful ionising X\-ray exposure as well as discomfort for the patient due to the need for compression of the breast. Discomfort is the main reason that only around 70% of women attend their screening appointments. Furthermore, X\-ray also performs poorly in the denser breasts of women under age 40 and hence women under age 50 are not offered routine screening in most countries, including the UK. However, women under 50 accounted for 18% of breast cancer incidences in the UK from 2015 \- 2017 \(the average number of new cases per year was just under 10,000 for this age range\). 

 Bristol’s work on landmine detection, led by Craddock and funded by the Ministry of Defence prompted the team to propose a novel radar\-based breast cancer imaging system as an alternative to X\-ray imaging. With funding from charitable sources and from EPSRC \[i, ii\] the Bristol team, led by Craddock as PI and including Preece, Leendertz, Klemm, Gibbins and Sarafianou, took the technology from theoretical simulation, through lab studies \(Figure 1\) and on to the implementation of a clinical system \(Figure 2\) at the University over the period 2001 to 2010. The team’s expertise in radar signal processing, electromagnetic modelling of complex structures and wideband antenna design led to key breakthroughs included the design of suitable antenna and array structures \[1, 2\] along with focussing algorithms \[3\]. 

 Such radar systems are clutter\-limited rather than signal to noise \(SNR\) limited.  The research challenges included obtaining sufficient bandwidth from an antenna small enough \[1\] to form into an array around the human body, reducing the large skin reflection and other clutter signals through multistatic signal processing \[3\] and being able to perform the necessary signal acquisition within the time period that a patient can lie still for. 

 


Figure 1: \(left\) original Bristol stacked patch antenna array, and \(right\) array performance being evaluated with a liquid “phantom” to replicate human tissue 

 Figure 2: The University’s original clinical prototype under construction in its laboratories 

 The prototype system was comprised of the University’s antenna array and custom\-built switching matrix to connect the antenna elements to a multi\-port vector network analyser \(VNA\) and the baseband signal was processed using the University’s multistatic focussing algorithms \[3\]. 

 The resulting experimental system \(Figure 2\) was initially evaluated using human body “phantoms” \[4\] in which it proved capable of imaging phantom tumours down to 4 mm diameter \(which would be classed as “early stage” cancer\). It then progressed to world\-first clinical trials of such an imaging system \[5\]. 

 In recognition of these achievements, Craddock was awarded the 2005 IEE J. A. Lodge prize for outstanding work in Medical Electronics. The team was subsequently awarded the 1<sup>st</sup> prize and Gold Medal in the ""SET for Britain"" Competition at the House of Commons in 2006 and the Royal Colleges Medal in 2012. 

 In 2005, the University set up spin\-out company, Micrima Ltd, to bring a workable device to market. In addition, subsequent inventive features based on the University’s research have strongly influenced the signal processing algorithms employed in the company’s prototypes \[3\]. In the period 2005 \- 2015 further enhancements in signal processing techniques were pioneered by the University \[6, F, G\] and licensed to Micrima \[A\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Following the success of early research, the University of Bristol set up a spin\-out company, Micrima Ltd in 2005, which licensed the relevant University IP \[F, G\] and took ownership of the experimental hardware and associated software. Within the current REF period the company has brought the concept to market both in the UK and overseas, with the aim of reducing nearly one million deaths each year. 



 Figure 3: Micrima’s MARIA system in use \(with photographic model\) 

 Micrima initially focussed on continuing the existing clinical trials process in order to evidence system performance in a spectrum of patients, to develop its IP portfolio, recruit an engineering team and understand, in collaboration with its suppliers Keysight, how to reduce the production costs of the University’s original experimental system. 

#  Commercialisation of novel technology 

 Regulatory compliance for medical devices is always a major hurdle en route to market and after refinement of the system hardware and software, Micrima commenced the regulatory approval process for its first commercial system MARIA<sup>TM</sup> in 2014 \(shown in Figure 3\), leading to the milestone of European regulatory approval in 2015 \[B\]. As described in \[B\] the system was the first to market worldwide. 

#  Improved cancer detection 

 In 2016, the company published its first trial data \[5\] to evidence system performance in a patient population. 86 imaged breasts yielded a detection rate of 74% which compares well to the 78% score reported in the digital mammographic imaging screening trial \(DMIST\) study \[5\]. In the dense breasts of younger women, MARIA detected 86% of the cancers \- a notable improvement on the DMIST dense breast group performance of 78%. While the sample size is as yet insufficient to draw definitive conclusions, the MARIA results in dense breasts are especially important since women with dense breast tissue have a significantly higher risk of breast cancer. 

 Professor Iain Lyburn, consultant radiologist at Cheltenham General Hospital, stated: *“In the younger patients, who’ve got dense breasts \[…\] the dense breast isn’t a problem, as it were, for the MARIA scan; it treats the breast the same as if it’s a very fatty breast, so potentially we’ll be able to use this in the younger patient for whom we can’t see things with mammograms at all. So in terms of diagnosis, and screening, and family risk patients \[…\] this is one of the areas that’s very exciting.”* \[C\]. The approved MARIA device went into full commercial trials at the Royal Marsden in London, which are ongoing at the time of writing \(the trials were suspended due to Covid\-19\), with 400 women screened to date. 

#  Improved patient wellbeing 

 All feedback from the trials indicate that the scan is much more comfortable for women. In addition, Prof. Lyburn stated that *“Also, as I understand it, people find it quite comfortable. One of the problems with mammography is up to 20% of ladies find it quite uncomfortable. The patients that we’ve had through so far expressed how surprised they are about how comfortable it is, so of course that would increase compliance and tolerance and make it much easier for ladies to have the scan done. …having the patients on board is really helpful.”* \[C\]. One trials patient, who had previously refused X\-ray screening and was interviewed on BBC Breakfast, commented: “Brilliant, painless, safe. It’s like a good meal in a restaurant. I’d go back.” \[A\]. 

 The MARIA device uses low power radio waves at a similar frequency to those commonly used by millions of mobile phones – it is harmless and non\-ionising. Unlike X\-ray therefore, there is no limit to how many times a woman can be imaged. Professor Lyburn emphasizes this *“The thing that’s excellent about it is that potentially it could be used several times on people without any radiation burden.”* \[C\]. 

#  Current status of company 

 Micrima is now an established company with 25 staff in its offices and laboratories in central Bristol, as well as supporting employment within its supply chain \(for example, Keysight \[C\]\). Since 2014, the company has raised GBP10.4 million in equity funding, GBP2 million from a corporate partner and GBP2.6 million in competitively awarded R&D grants. \[A\]. 

 The company has received several awards, including the Frost and Sullivan New Product Innovation award \(December 2018\), Made in the South\-West award \(November 2018\), the Disrupt SW Index award \(September 2018\) and the Medilink SW innovation award \(February 2017\). It was chosen as one of the Top Ten Best Healthcare Start\-ups to watch in 2019 \(July 2019\) \[D\]. 

 
Following a marketing and distribution deal with Hologic Ltd, the first orders were received, and imaging systems shipped to hospitals in the summer of 2020 \[A\].  Following staff training with the team of Professor Uwe Fischer at the Diagnostic Breast Centre in Göttingen \(Figure 4\), the first system is being used with patients there. Delayed slightly by the pandemic, a second system is now in use at the University Medical Center Mainz, with Professor Andrea Teifke \[E\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Positron emission particle tracking \(PEPT\) — conceived and developed at the University of Birmingham — has been used to investigate, **redesign and** **improve manufacturing processes and technology** at over 20 leading international companies. This impact on **production** and on **commerce and the economy** led to **gains in productivity** **because of research\-led changes in practice, improved products, more efficient processes and less waste**. PEPT has reduced energy use and production time in the manufacture of \[text removed for publication\]. It has improved design for pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment that has been adopted by global companies \(GSK, Pfizer, AstraZeneca\). This led to £100M in sales for GEA Pharma Systems and to reductions in the environmental footprint of pharmaceutical production. PEPT also enabled new and improved catalyst production processes, driving new sales and projects worth over £300M at Johnson Matthey. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

####  **Background** 

 Most continuous industrial manufacturing processes involve the **flow** of materials, examples being the production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, home and personal care products, and food. However, such materials are typically opaque and real processes take place within the walls of vessels or pipes. Understanding and improving these processes therefore requires a measuring technique which can ‘see inside’ opaque materials and map their flow behaviour. Conceived by Parker and colleagues at Birmingham’s interdisciplinary Positron Imaging Centre in the 1990s, Positron Emission Particle Tracking \(PEPT\) is a tool for studying the fundamentals of flow in physics and engineering. **PEPT is** **the most — and frequently **only** — effective way to follow motion in opaque systems**, particularly within metal\-walled vessels. 

 Since 2001, PEPT at Birmingham has been funded by the EPSRC \(notably three successive Platform Grants 1998–2014 and a Programme Grant running until 2024\) and by industry. It is a novel adaptation of the medical imaging technique positron emission tomography \(PET\). Both rely on detecting the pairs of back\-to\-back gamma\-rays emitted during positron/electron annihilation as a first step in locating a positron\-emitting radioactive tracer. Whereas in PET the concentration of a radioactively labelled fluid tracer is mapped in 3D, in PEPT a single radioactively labelled particle is accurately tracked at high speed — making the technique suitable for studying high\-speed flows \(1–10 m/s\). PEPT can be used to study flow in granular material \(labelling and tracking a single grain\) or fluid flow \(using a neutrally buoyant tracer particle\). Because gamma\-rays are highly penetrating, measurements can be made through metallic walls \(up to \~5cm thickness of steel, for example\). This **enables non\-invasive studies to be performed on realistic engineering systems under pressure and/or temperature, and brings a wide range of industrial processes within investigative reach**. 

####  **Key findings** 

 PEPT is an innovation in measurement that was initially limited in application by the nature of both the hardware and analysis techniques. Improvements since 2000 — particularly the reduced size of the tracer particle and the adaption of the detector array to the process of interest — have enabled many more industrial processes to be studied. Significant developments in research underpinning PEPT since 2000 include: 

-  **KF1.** Developing and commissioning a new positron camera, for which we have **demonstrated 20x increase in sensitivity** \(R1\) widening the range of the industrial processes which can be studied. 

-  **KF2.** Increasing the range of tracer types and **reducing the minimum size of the tracer entity which can be tracked by an order of magnitude** \(from 500µm to 50µm; R2\), in keeping with the need to use a tracer which is identical, or closely similar to, the material of interest. This again widens the range of application, particularly in the manufacture of consumer goods such as detergent powders and pharmaceuticals. 

-  **KF3.** Improving and extending the range of detector arrays which can be used; constructing transportable **modular cameras with flexible geometries**, allowing application of PEPT on larger systems and investigation of **industrial equipment **in situ** \(R3, R4\). 

 These underpinning improvements in measurement capability have been augmented by developments in analysis techniques which have been successfully applied to the investigation of flow processes in industrial equipment: 

-  **KF4.** Complex processes, such as agglomeration, can now be followed by **substantially** **better tracking and extraction of information from the data** \(R5\). 

-  **KF5.** Constructing **techniques to allow the use of PEPT trajectories for the determination of dispersion in mixing** and rates of shear in three dimensions \(R6; fig. 1\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Over 20 industrial companies globally \(from multinationals to SMEs\), across a wide range of industry sectors, including oil and chemical, pharmaceuticals, minerals, and home and personal care, have adopted PEPT. We focus on three examples, \[text removed for publication\], GEA Pharma Systems and Johnson Matthey \(JM\). 

####  \[text removed for publication\] 

####  **2. Pharma companies have adopted a new manufacturing technology, with considerable savings** 

 PEPT enabled **improved machine design and the development of a new tablet manufacturing process**, ConsiGma, produced by GEA Pharma Systems \[S3; KF4 and KF5\]. Most pharmaceuticals are sold as tablets manufactured using a process called wet granulation, in which particles of the active drug substance are combined with other components to form free\-flowing granules which can be fed to a tablet press. Using PEPT, GEA developed ConsiGma as a radically different continuous granulation system consisting of a twin\-screw powder conveyor to which a binding liquid is added and in which screw elements perform different functions in the granulation process. GEA confirmed that this process is a more effective and efficient method stating, “in addition to the advantages of better process control and enclosed operation, adoption of ConsiGma results on average in a 40% reduction in labour costs, 60% reduction in manufacturing space compared with current industry standards and 50% energy savings resulting from reduced power requirement and heat recovery” \[S3\]. 

 In 2012, GEA sold the ConsiGma continuous production line to GlaxoSmithKline \(GSK\), as an experimental tablet manufacturing process for its plant at Ware. This was the first of over 50 installations around the world at an average sale price of £2M each. GSK, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have all adopted the technology. The VP of GSK highlighted “some of the fantastic benefits and savings that GSK has experienced since investing in the GEA ConsiGma continuous tableting line. Savings included an 85% reduction in the amount of API \[active pharmaceutical ingredient\] that would normally have been used \[. . .\], and being able to carry out 90 experiments in one day, which would normally have taken between 3–6 months with conventional batch based development\!” \[S4\]. Total sales of ConsiGma are in excess of £100M to date \[S3\]. ConsiGma is now used globally to manufacture drugs for a range of treatments including Cystic Fibrosis \(Orkambi and Symdeko from Vertex Pharmaceuticals\) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia \(Daurisimo, Pfizer Inc.\), “with consequent benefits to the health of thousands of patients” \[S3\]. 

 This new technology has **environmental benefits** as it replaces traditional discrete batch operations \(typically crystallisation, milling, mixing, granulation, drying and tableting\) — “all of which involve significant risk of failure, as well as environmental cost and risk of personal exposure to the active drug” \[S3\]. In contrast, ConsiGma produces “fast, continuous operation in enclosed machines with a high degree of automatic monitoring and control, a smaller physical footprint and a reduced environmental burden” \[S3\]. 

####  **3. Enhancing JM’s business performance by creating new and improved products** 

 PEPT has been used in developing new **products and processes** with JM, a world\-leading catalytic materials technology company with annual sales of £4.2B, in four key areas. 

-  PEPT **enabled improvements in the design and operation of the multiphase catalytic reactors** operated by JM’s customers in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industries \[KF1–KF5\]. This enhanced the company’s technical support for its customers and generated new sales. JM’s Scientific Consultant \(lead chemical engineer\) confirmed that “learning and data derived from PEPT were widely used internally, to coach technical sales personnel” and that “retained and new sales were directly attributed to the PEPT data\-based service” \[S5\]. 

-  Models are being used to design two major capital projects worth in excess of £300M, which rely on the improvements in modelling and scale\-up of precipitation processes based on KF4 and KF5. PEPT’s work “allowed Johnson Matthey to provide improved guidelines for precipitator design, resulting in product improvements or, in one case through design improvement, allowing introduction of a new product that could otherwise not have been manufactured at scale” \[S5\]. In addition, the PEPT data were used to validate a reduced order Zonal Model, which is much simpler to use than computational fluid dynamics models. This “formed the basis for several new product precipitations from pilot to production scale. Without the PEPT data, JM would not have had the confidence to use these models” \[S5\]. 

-  PEPT informed operational problem diagnosis and validation of models and measurement techniques in blending of precursors for vehicle Emission Control catalysts \(a £2.5B sales generator for JM \[S5\]\), based on KF4 and KF5. JM confirmed that “\[t\]he combined output of the PEPT study enabled a step change in the process analysis and design of washcoat and ink manufacture in JM” \[S5\]. It has been applied to the manufacture of inks for fuel cells and automotive glazes “to improve manufacturing performance globally and led to significant improvements” \[S5\]. 

 PEPT data \[KF4 and KF5\] were used to validate models for processing of particulate products. Discrete Element Method \(DEM\) modelling is a key company capability now deployed in support of several critical manufacturing process development projects: “JM is currently using DEM as a key development and design tool for key future manufacturing technologies, and has the confidence to do so in large part due to the validation data obtained using PEPT” \[S5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Venous thromboembolism \(VTE\) comprises potentially fatal blood clots throughout the body. Swansea University research has identified both the emotional burden of VTE and means to alleviate it. This has benefitted patient well\-being by: \(1\) influencing UK \(NICE\) and USA treatment guidelines \(2\) influencing NHS service provision, \(3\) developing and disseminating an intervention designed to help patients cope with adverse emotional sequelae. This self\-help intervention has provided support through the Thrombosis UK website, associated webinars and YouTube presentations addressing >1,000 participants worldwide, and health care providers across Wales. Variants of the intervention have been successfully used by patients undergoing cancer risk assessment and health professionals caring for COVID\-19 patients.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Venous Thromboembolism is a major cause of morbidity and mortality affecting 1:1000 patients annually. Its long\-term impacts include post\-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension. The experience of a VTE has the hallmarks of an event likely to cause significant psychological distress. It is typically sudden, unexpected and can be life threatening. In addition, patients have to live with the likelihood of subsequent \(and likely more problematic\) VTEs. While local clinicians with whom we worked were aware of these issues, at the inception of our research they had received minimal empirical investigation. 

 This research has two strands: a\) identifying the scope of the problem and the characteristics of the short\- and long\-term consequences of VTE, and b\) the development and assessment of an intervention designed to reduce this impact. 

1.  **Adverse psychological consequences of VTE** 

 The first research strand was among the first to identify the adverse psychological consequences of VTE. The first study \[ **R1**\], a qualitative study of a random sample of patients with VTE, was followed by a yearlong longitudinal study in a representative sample of patients \[ **R2, R3**\]. These data have been augmented by additional quantitative data \[ **R3, R4**\] and together, highlight the personal consequences and high rates of anxiety, health anxiety, and post\-traumatic stress among VTE survivors \- a 20\-40% prevalence for up to one year following the thrombosis. 

1.  **Development and testing of an intervention** 

 The second research strand involved developing an effective intervention to provide psychological support for this sample. For this, Bennett revisited a brief self\-help intervention previously developed through his 2013 research on reducing distress among individuals undergoing genetic risk assessment for breast cancer \[ **R5**\] and in patients with cardiac problems. Based on cognitive behavioural principles, this self\-help intervention provided strategies considered relevant to VTE survivors, such as the need to control worry and feelings of panic. A new intervention was developed that incorporated mindfulness, relaxation, distraction, and cognitive restructuring as a suite of techniques described in a series of simple one\-/two\-page leaflets: a highly cost\-effective intervention likely to benefit all but the most distressed individuals.  These techniques are widely used. However, the research presented here was the first application of these techniques in the context of VTE. 

 Evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention was obtained from two sources \(i\) a quantitative survey of user’s views on the useability of the leaflets and \(ii\) an uncontrolled study of the effectiveness of the leaflets in reducing worry and panic. The intervention for VTE patients proved highly successful, achieving significant reductions in anxiety and worry, with data to be reported in future publications. As an example, there was evidence of a reduction in the percentage of participants experiencing clinically significant levels of trauma symptoms, including intrusive worries, from 40 to 23 percent, and a significant \(p 0.015\) reduction in health anxiety. As evidence of the adaptability of the intervention approach, variants of the intervention have also proven effective in reducing distress associated with cardiac conditions and the distress associated with caring for patients with COVID\-19 \[ **R6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Influencing health care and health care policy** 

 As a consequence of our research, Bennett was the only psychologist invited on a working party organised by Anticoagulation UK and the Bristol Myers Squibbs\-Pfizer Alliance, tasked with developing optimal standards of care for VTE patients. These guidelines \( **C4**\) highlight the need for good psychological care: ‘ *Healthcare professionals should consider the psychological implications … and provide appropriate support. This should take place at every stage of the patient pathway…*’. In addition, our work \[ **R1**\] was the only relevant research cited in a state\-of\-the\-art review by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haematology Steering Committee for World Thrombosis Day \( **C1**\). The same paper was cited in the 2019 NICE Guidelines for Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism \( **C2**\) and review of papers contributing to the US American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines \( **C3**\). 

 Additionally, we have worked closely with the charity Thrombosis UK \(TUK\), giving talks at over 20 clinician \(CPD\-accredited\) and 10 patient meetings throughout the UK over the past five years, with a reach of over 3000 attenders. Its CEO provides a testimonial on the high demand for psychological support within the VTE patient population and how we have increased awareness of this \( **C5**\). Finally, two Health Trusts \(Liverpool and Leeds\) have established psychological provision for VTE patients, through employing clinical psychologists, as a result of our research \( **C6**\). 

 **Influencing patient outcomes** 

 The intervention, described in section 2b above \(Development and testing of an intervention\), is available through a range of outlets: 

 *Thrombosis UK website* 

 Downloadable information ‘fact sheets’ have been available on the TUK website since January 2020. Between January and October 2020, these were ‘visited’ 1,328 times and were the 7<sup>th</sup> most visited page on the website \(from a potential 1,902\). During the same period, recordings of four videos based around the intervention, on YouTube and the TUK website, had approximately 1,700 views. A further video aimed at health professionals had 102 views. Feedback on both was positive from patients and health professionals *: “The new booklets are brilliant, I have read and re\-read them and am going to share them with my clinician, every patient needs to be given these.”* \(patient\), *“I wanted to let you know we are downloading the leaflets on psychological impact and VTE and sharing them with our whole team as well as with patients in our care. It is so good to at last have resources that share this really important impact of VTE in an easy\-to\-read format and offer information and tips for patients. Brilliant.”* \(professional\) \( **C7**\). Early evidence of the clinical effectiveness of the intervention is reported in section 2b, above. 

 *Secondary health care services* 

 The intervention has been implemented across Wales. The VTE Pharmacy Lead of Swansea Bay UHB \( **C8**\) and the VTE Medical Lead of Aneurin Bevan UHB \( **C9**\) were early adopters of the intervention and provide testimony of benefits in their patient groups. In Swansea Bay UHB, an estimated 50\-60 per cent of patients with VTE have been offered the intervention and found it of value \( **C8**\), while the leaflets are offered to all VTE patients in Aneurin Bevan UHB, with an estimated usage by at least 80% of those offered them from a total of 500 patients per annum \( **C9**\).   Betsi Cadwalader and Cardiff and Vale UHBs have also agreed to its use. Together, these data suggest an approximate 1500\-2000 patients per annum may benefit from this approach across the four UHBs in which it has been used. 

 *Ad hoc developments* 

 We have had multiple requests for early versions of the intervention from health care providers across the UK, including Birmingham, London, Liverpool and Leeds. As one example, in 12/2019, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust asked to use our intervention as a template for one they were developing. They have since decided to use the intervention without change: ‘ *They're fantastic\! Well done, it is great to have such lovely resources out there that we can use in clinic and signpost our patients to. We'll definitely use them and will signpost patients to the \[TUK\] site too’* \(Coagulation Clinical Nurse Specialist, Kings College Hospital\). 

 *Variants of the intervention* 

 Finally, the simplicity and easy adaptability of the intervention allow its use in a range of settings and health problems. Originally developed for patients undergoing assessment of genetic risk for breast cancer, one simple adaption has been the use of a strategy designed to help cope with worry, to help health care professionals cope with caring for patients with COVID\-19. Simply ‘telling their COVID story’ to a remote and anonymous website as a means of emotional venting resulted in significant immediate emotional benefits for a range of health care workers \( **C9**\). Given the high levels of stress among multiple patient groups, including cancer and cardiac patients, this approach could easily and usefully be adapted for use with them.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dental caries and obesity are the most prevalent non\-communicable diseases worldwide. Caries cause pain, anxiety and functional limitation, and treatment consumes 5–10% of healthcare budgets in industrialised countries. Newcastle research quantified a link between dental caries and the amount and frequency of free sugars intake. This evidence underpinned a strong recommendation in the 2015 WHO Guideline on sugars intake to cap intake at <10% of total daily energy. Consequently, this Guideline directly influenced the worldwide introduction of sugar taxes. In the UK, a public campaign to introduce a sugar tax, informed by the WHO Guideline, generated Parliamentary debate. The resulting “Soft Drinks Industry Levy” was introduced in April 2018, prompting manufacturers to reformulate their products to substantially reduce sugar content. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Background and unmet need</ins> 

 Free sugars contribute to two separate major health concerns: obesity and dental caries. Dental caries are the most prevalent global non\-communicable disease and lead to pain, anxiety and social limitations including poor school attendance. In addition, treating dental diseases consumes 5–10% of healthcare budgets in industrialised countries**Footnote:**

 https://www.fdiworlddental.org/oral\-health/ask\-the\-dentist/facts\-figures\-and\-stats 
. In 2010, untreated caries in permanent teeth was the most prevalent health condition worldwide, affecting 35% of the global population or 2.4 billion people**Footnote:**
. 

 It is well known that a major cause of dental caries and obesity is free sugars, and a 2003 WHO recommendation set an upper limit for free sugars intake of 10% of energy intake at the population level. However, data were insufficient to set a precise numerical limit on sugar consumption relating to obesity and dental caries at the individual level. 

 <ins>Newcastle research set a numerical cap on free sugars intake</ins> 

 In response, Newcastle conducted a series of studies to determine a precise cap for free sugars intake. An initial review \(R2\) summarised the existing field of research into the link between dental caries and the amount, and frequency, of free sugars intake. The paper recommended a maximum value of free sugars intake of 10% of energy intake and to limit the frequency of consuming free sugars to four times a day. A later review \(R3\) found that “sugars are the main dietary factor associated with dental caries” and stated that when sugar intake is capped at 15 kg/person/year, the level of dental caries was low. Controlling free sugars intake via a precise cap was therefore identified as an important part of preventing caries. Subsequently, the WHO commissioned the WHO Collaborating Centre at Newcastle University, headed by Professor Paula Moynihan, to undertake a systematic review into the relationship between amount of sugar intake and the risk of dental caries. The WHO commissioned the Centre due to their track record in the area of diet and caries, as represented by R1\-R4. 

 The Centre drew on their expertise and experience in the field to produce a high\-quality systematic review of 55 international studies, following the PRISMA guidance**Footnote:**

 [http://www.prisma\-statement.org/](http://www.prisma-statement.org/) 
and assessed according to GRADE Working Group guidelines**Footnote:**

 [https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/](https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/) 
\(R5\). This review found consistent evidence of moderate quality showing a decrease in caries when free sugars intake was <10% of energy, but a significant relationship when sugars intake was <5%. The data provided by R5 were robust enough to allow a numerical cap to be set which applied to both obesity and dental caries. The data also underpinned the WHO’s decision to reduce their 2003 recommendation of an upper limit of 10% at the population level to 10% at the individual level, and to suggest a further reduction to 5% at the individual level. The new limits discovered in R5 were central to 2015 WHO guidance on sugar intake relating to both dental caries and obesity, and the resulting worldwide impact is described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impact on World Health Organization \(WHO\) Guideline on Sugars</ins> 

 Newcastle research provided the basis for the WHO 2015 Guideline “Sugars intake for adults and children” \(EV1\), which assesses the effect of free sugars on unhealthy weight gain and dental caries. The latter aspect is informed entirely by R5; in addition, the data from R5 were robust enough to provide a numerical cap that applies to both aspects, as stated on page 16 of the Guideline. On pages 4 and 16, the Guideline strongly recommends reducing free sugars intake to below 10% of total energy intake, and recommends a further reduction to below 5%. 

 The Guideline was subsequently endorsed by two bodies, both citing R5. The first was the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, whose 2015 Scientific Report**Footnote:**

 [https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019\-09/Scientific\-Report\-of\-the\-2015\-Dietary\-Guidelines\-Advisory\-Committee.pdf](https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Scientific-Report-of-the-2015-Dietary-Guidelines-Advisory-Committee.pdf)  Page 342. 
strongly recommends keeping sugars intake to below 10%, citing the WHO Guideline and R5 specifically on page 344. Secondly, the FDI World Dental Federation’s 2015 response**Footnote:**

 Available on request 
 to the WHO recommendations requests that “the 5% reduction is not a conditional but a strong recommendation.” In addition, the report states that “the systematic review by Moynihan and Kelly \[R5\] is the most extensive and rigorous on the subject.” 

 <ins>Impact of WHO Guideline on global implementation of a Sugar Tax</ins> 

 In direct response to the WHO Guideline, three countries implemented a Sugar Tax on soft drinks as a vehicle to limit free sugars intake. The first country was South Africa, who in April 2018 introduced a tax as a result of a July 2016 Policy Paper \(EV2\), directly citing the Guideline \(page 5\). Secondly, in May 2018 Ireland announced a tax of 20c/litre on drinks with 5\-8g of sugar per 100ml, and 30c per litre on drinks with ≥8g/100ml \(EV3\). This resulted from an October 2016 Working Paper citing both R5 and the Guideline. The third country was Bermuda, who in October 2018 introduced a 50% tax on sugary products, which increased to 75% in April 2019. This resulted from a Ministerial brief delivered in June 2018 \(EV4\) which cites the Guideline. 

 The 2015 Guideline also informed a 2017 WHO Technical Document \(EV5\). On page 2, the document proposes a tax on sugary drinks as a major action to help prevent obesity, promote population health and reduce healthcare costs. Consequently, 13 further countries and cities have introduced or updated a sugar tax since the publication of the Technical Document, increasing the population now benefitting from a cap on sugar intake to over 536 million. These are \(EV6\): Brazil \(2018\), Estonia \(2018\), France \(2018\), French Polynesia \(2018\), Malaysia \(2019\), Norway \(2018\), Oman \(2019\), Peru \(2018\), the Philippines \(2018\), Qatar \(2019\), the Seychelles \(2019\) and Thailand \(2019\); and San Francisco and Seattle, \(both 2018, EV7\). 

 <ins>Campaign to introduce a Sugar Tax in the UK</ins> 

 In 2015, a “Sugar Rush” campaign took place in the UK to reduce sugar intake. The accompanying Channel 4 Documentary mentions the WHO report and repeatedly calls for a “Sugar Tax”. The campaign led to a petition for a tax on sugary drinks, which closed with over 155,000 signatures and was debated in both Parliament and in the House of Lords. A July 2016 Public Health England document \(EV8\) cites the WHO figures in a recommendation to reduce free sugars to 5% of energy intake to combat both dental caries and obesity, especially in children. In April 2017 this was cited, along with the WHO recommendations directly, in a House of Commons Library Briefing Paper that calls for a tax on sugary drinks \(EV9\). Consequently, the Soft Drinks Industry Levy \(SDIL\) came into effect across the UK in April 2018. Under the SDIL, drinks containing 5\-8g of sugar/100ml are taxed at 18 pence per litre; and drinks containing >8g/100ml at 24 pence per litre. 

 <ins>Response by manufacturers and retailers to the Sugar Drinks Industry Levy</ins> <ins>\(SDIL\)</ins> 

 In response to the SDIL, most soft drink manufacturers and retailers reformulated their products, including Suntory \(Lucozade and Ribena\), Britvic \(Robinson’s, J20 and Fruit Shoot\); AG Barr \(Irn Bru and Rubicon\), Coca\-Cola Fanta; and retailers’ own brands including Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Co\-op. Internationally, in September 2017 Unilever announced a reduction in the sugar content of certain drinks in line with WHO recommendations \(EV10\). 

 A September 2019 report by Public Health England \(EV11\) found that the average sugar content per 100ml of drinks subject to the SDIL decreased by 28.8% between 2015 and 2018, saving 30,000 tons of sugar from entering the food chain. In addition, sales shifted towards products with a lower sugar content, indicating that the higher price of drinks subject to the SDIL has changed consumer buying habits. 

 <ins>Summary</ins> 

 Research by Newcastle University allowed a numerical cap to be placed on free sugars intake. This evidence underpinned 2015 WHO guidance, which contributed towards several countries introducing a sugar tax on soft drinks. This high\-level change in policy has already led to reformulations of sugary drinks, which are a step towards reducing obesity and dental caries at a population level.

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) research on quantifying anthropogenic effects on past, present and future climates and extreme weather events, underpins climate change policies worldwide, benefiting and protecting populations across the world, particularly those most vulnerable to climate change. In particular, estimates of the human contribution to recent warming, and of the climate sensitivity \(how much greenhouse gas emissions warm the climate\), were key contributions to the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\), which in turn had a large influence on Government commitments made in the 2015 Paris Agreement. UoE research on determining the human contribution to climate change, including to change in extreme events, influenced the 2016 report of the US National Academies on attribution of extreme weather events, which then influenced service provision on event attribution and national climate change policies in the UK and worldwide. 
","
 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 UoE research has made crucial contributions to \(a\) estimating the human fingerprint in the climate system from observed change, and with it, the climate sensitivity \(how much greenhouse gas emissions warm the climate\), and \(b\) quantifying how changes in the frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events have already resulted from the changing climate \(event attribution\). 

##  \(a\) Human fingerprint and Climate sensitivity 

 The UoE team has played a significant role in determining key relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and climate warming. This has been achieved by world leading analysis synthesising multiple sources of evidence, including observed warming in the pre\- and post\-industrial period paleoclimate and instrumental records, and physical understanding derived from worldwide modelling approaches. This led to the quantification of the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity \(ECS\) ie the long\-term global mean temperature increase caused by a doubling of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration from records of the observed warming **\[3.1\]** and synthesized evidence from historical warming with that from analysis of global modelling and feedback processes **\[3.2\]**. Furthermore, the human fingerprint was detected in global precipitation patterns **\[3.3\]** and in widespread intensification of extreme precipitation **\[3.4\]**, confirming that human influence is changing mean and intense precipitation. These publications were used as evidence in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) reports. 

 Subsequent UoE research estimated the variation in the Earth’s pre\-industrial climate, attributing observed variations in climate to radiative forcing and estimating detectable greenhouse gas contributions to surface temperature from across the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This research is important because it is the baseline used by the IPCC to assess climate change stabilisation targets. Analysis of the pre\-industrial climate led the team to conclude that correcting this baseline reduced by up to 0.2 degrees the future further warming before the Paris Agreement targets are exceeded, with a corresponding reduction of up to 40% in the remaining future budget for carbon dioxide emissions **\[3.5\]**. 

##  \(b\) Event Attribution 

 The UoE team produced world\-leading research into the crucial task of validating the hypothesis that human\-caused climate change has changed both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. They have led the interpretation of results that found that increases in emissions of greenhouse gases have caused a 5% increase in extreme precipitation events across the globe, and have showed that human emissions have contributed to observed changes in large\-scale precipitation **\[3.4\]**, a finding further strengthened in recent follow\-up publications **\[3.6\].** This work underpins the attribution of recent extreme events highlighted in the National Academies report **\[5.5\].**

###  Informing the Paris Agreement 

 UoE research on the effect of increasing greenhouse gases on past and future climates and precipitation patterns has made vital contributions to reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) since August 2013, with the team’s “ *contribution to the IPCC and public policy”* judged *“substantial and a very good example of innovative and policy relevant research”* **\[5.1\].** The IPCC reports directly informed the international climate change negotiations which resulted in the 2015 United Nations Paris Agreement treaty on climate change. The Paris Agreement is the overarching global framework for addressing climate change, with 194 states and the European Union \(EU\) as signatories in 2015.  Of these, 187 states and the EU, representing about 79% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have now ratified or acceded to the Agreement. 

 Professor Hegerl was a lead author of the IPCC’s Working Group 1 Report on *Climate Change 2014 \- the Physical Science Basis*, published in June 2014 **\[5.2\]**. This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate change since 2007 when the Fourth Assessment Report \(AR4\) was released. She was selected for her role based on her scientific output on the causes of climate change. Among the IPCC authors she was selected for the author team of the AR5 Synthesis Report: *Climate Change 2014* **\[5.2\],** and led the section on observed emissions and changes in the climate in that report. The AR5 Synthesis Report \(approved in the IPCC plenary meeting in October 2014\), is the overarching and top\-level document of the IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report, which “ *was the scientific foundation for the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change”* **\[5.3\].** The Working Group 1 co\-chair describes her “ *seminal work that has transformed our field… you have pioneered the method to detect fingerprints of anthropogenic climate change combining observations and climate model simulations..this \[method\] has become one of the central pillars of climate science”* **\[5.3\]**. Altogether the IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report **\[5.2\]** contains 18 citations of Professor Hegerl, 2 of Professor Tett, 3 of Dr Polson and 1 of Dr Schurer \(allocated to first author listed only to avoid duplication\), and the Edinburgh team has provided 3 figures.  In particular, an update to **\[3.2\]** provided a key figure in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, which was also reproduced in the Technical Summary as figure TFE6.1, and **\[3.1\- 3.6\]** are all cited in IPCC 5th Assessment Report, or the 1.5 degree special report **\[5.2\]**. 

 Professor Hegerl also led the Guidance Paper on attribution of observed climate change and impacts to causes for use across the IPCC’s working groups, which was widely used and cited in the overarching IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report. At the approval plenary for the report involving all the United Nations country delegations she presented the keynote presentation on climate sensitivity. This was one of only four key science presentations given to directly communicate the report’s findings to full plenary session of Government representatives **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. Professor Tett was selected to be an expert review editor for the 2014 IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report, Working Group I.  The former Head of Science at the Department of Energy and Climate Change describes the two key issues that the UoE team highlighted – climate sensitivity **\[3.1,3.2\]** and event attribution **\[5.5\]**, as “ *key policy issues which affect both the scale and urgency required of the response to climate change internationally… the agreement that was reached to limit the global temperature rise to 2C above pre\-industrial levels \(and to aim for as close to 1.5C as possible\) and achieve net zero emissions in the second part of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, drew directly on this and similar work”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 Following the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change requested advice from the IPCC on the target of limiting climate warming to 1.5 degrees C. The resulting 2018 landmark IPCC special report on *Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C* \(1.5C Report\), arguably one of the most important and influential reports in the IPCC’s history, cited four papers from UoE climate researchers, with findings from **\[3.5\]** applied directly in the calculation of the future emissions allowable without exceeding 1.5C warming. The 1.5C report has guided climate change policies across the globe including, via assessment by the UK Committee on Climate Change, the UK Parliament strengthening its climate target in June 2019 by passing legislation requiring the government to reduce the UK's net emissions of greenhouse gases by 100% relative to 1990 levels by 2050. This was described as the ‘ *defining decision of this generation in fulfilling our responsibility to the next*’ by Prime Minister Theresa May. **\[5.4\]**. 

###  Contribution to national policymaking 

 The UoE team’s research identifying human influence in extreme weather events has successfully engaged policymakers in the immediate risks and damages resulting from climate change. Professor Hegerl was on the committee \(one of ten\) that produced the 2016 US National Academies review on extreme weather event attribution **\[5.5\]**, which cites 10 of her papers \(5 as first author or principal supervisor; incl. **\[3.6\]**\) as well as the IPCC guidance document **\[5.2\]**. This report reached the major conclusion that it is now possible to identify the role of climate change in individual extreme events. The report is “ *by all metrics, \[…\] among the most impactful contributions of the National Academies in the past decade*” and was widely reported and communicated to US agencies and policymakers. It was downloaded more than 27,000 times by October 2020, ranking it as the most downloaded Earth Science report, and in the top 1% of all National Academies’ products. It was also covered by 300 news outlets, with “ *multiple mentions by leading outlets including the New York Times, Washington Post, Forbes and CNN”*. It was briefed to numerous audiences, including multiple US government agencies, staff from House and Senate committees, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. **\[5.6\]**. The report also underpinned the international development of an operational event attribution capability that can rapidly assess the factors contributing to extreme events. This “ *enables analyses to be completed quickly after an event, leading to more direct connection to climate change*” in media communication about an extreme event. The work was named as one of the top ten breakthrough technologies by the MIT Tech Review in 2020 **\[5.6\]**. Professor Hegerl also wrote the section on changes in climate extremes of the Climate Updates report by the Royal Society. This was used to inform policymakers ahead of the 2017 Bonn COP23 on scientific developments in the understanding and prediction of climate change since the 2014 IPCC 5th Assessment Report **\[5.7\]**. 

  

 The team’s research into extreme events and climate sensitivity has further contributed to international reports \(eg Figure 10.11 in the 5<sup>th</sup> IPCC Report **\[5.2\]** is adapted from **\[3.3\]**. Professor Hegerl chaired the scientific review group for the UK Met Office Hadley Centre 2014\-2017 \(review group member from 2008\) **\[5.1\]**, and was a review group member for the recently released UK climate predictions 2018 \(UKCP18\) **\[5.8\]** which provide quantitative climate change predictions for UK policymakers and stakeholders informing major decisions on climate change adaptation e.g. managing flood risk and rising sea levels.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 1912, the Olympic Games have included a cultural programme known as the Cultural Olympiad, comprised of commissioned artworks and festivals in the Olympic city. Research conducted by Dr Garcia since 2006 \(within the Institute of Cultural Capital since 2010\) found that the Cultural Olympiad has been consistently under resourced and isolated from the Games hosting process, lacking visibility and operational support. Our research offered recommendations for enabling the Games to take root in host cities in more sensitive and place\-aware ways, to engage diverse audiences, and to secure longer\-term cultural legacies. As a direct result of our recommendations, since 2013, the International Olympic Committee has made policy changes, introduced new roles and staff functions, and created new forms of engagement with the Cultural Olympiad. Consequently, the organisers of the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Games also adopted our recommendations and evaluation framework. Follow\-up research has also shaped how other major event organisers \(e.g. UK Cities of Culture, Edinburgh Festival, Commonwealth Games\) plan for, resource, deliver and evaluate cultural programming. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The Cultural Olympiad \(CO\) is the official cultural programme of the Olympic Games. It has evolved from niche art competitions \(1912\-1948\) into broader culture and art festivals taking place before and during the Games sporting competitions. The CO is the responsibility of respective Olympic Games Organising Committees \(OCOGs\), organisations that only exist in relation to each Games edition and are based in specific host cities. OCOGs are in turn overseen by the International Olympic Committee which is the leading Olympic body and has existed since 1894, overviewing the Olympic Movement in 206 nations as well as coordinating the summer, winter and youth Olympic Games. 

 Due to the significance of the Games as the largest international mega\-event, with 206 participating nations, the CO offers Olympic host cities the opportunity to push forward cultural policy priorities and showcase their local culture in a global setting. To Games stakeholders, it offers the opportunity to appreciate the context to the sporting competitions and engage more meaningfully with the Olympics and other Games participants. CO activities are often small in scale but also include iconic events such as the World Shakespeare Festival \(London 2012\), music performances on top of the Great Wall of China \(Beijing 2008\), and acrobatics on the Sydney Opera House rooftop \(Sydney 2000\). Despite these few iconic instances, the CO itself lacks recognition as an entity, and the direct connection with the Olympic Games is often missing from public perception. Garcia has led a longitudinal programme of international research since 1999, securing multiple funding to document developments at each Games edition. We outline below the key projects that underpin the impacts listed in section 4. 

 Research carried out by Garcia and funded by the British Academy in 2008 \( **3.1**\) revealed that the Cultural Olympiad lacked funding, specialist teams and centralised support from the International Olympic Committee \(IOC\) – in existence since 1894 \- as well as within respective Games organising committees at both the summer and winter editions of the Olympics. This in turn resulted in no brand recognition amongst Olympic audiences and poor to non\-existent media coverage during Games time. The research further revealed that underfunding was a direct result of the absence of concrete references to the CO in Olympic policy, strategy and operational frameworks. The research concluded with a series of recommendations to the IOC. These included i\) the creation of a clear global Olympic cultural policy framework and action plan, ii\) the establishment of specific culture objectives for each Games edition, iii\) better integration of cultural, educational and sporting responsibilities for Games staff, iv\) the introduction of clauses about the Cultural Olympiad in Olympic marketing and branding guidelines, and v\) the appointment of culture specialists as dedicated staff with executive powers within the IOC headquarters. As noted in section 4, all of these recommendations have been eventually adopted and led to major changes in the positioning of the CO as a strategic asset. 

  

 This ongoing research led to García’s 2012 book \( **3.2**\), the first on the subject of global cultural policy and mega\-events, and the first to document the limitations and potential of the Olympic Games cultural policy framework. The book argues that the cultural relevance of a major event, like the Olympic Games, is highly dependent on coherent policy frameworks linking the event’s long\-term global aspirations with the specific needs and context of respective host cities. Without this, major events fail to leave long\-term cultural legacies. The research also highlights that major events are often unable to provide an experience that fully engages the host community due to their over\-emphasis on a global economic rather than a locally rooted social and cultural agenda. 

 In response to this publication, in 2014, the IOC commissioned a report \( **3.3**\) from the Institute of Cultural Capital on the recurrent challenges hampering the CO. The report offered a SWOT analysis, based on ethnographic research and secondary data analysis. It recommended actions such as the inclusion of cultural experts \(as opposed to only sport experts\) within the Games organising committee board of directors; specific branding for the CO; and improving data collection, evaluation practices and archiving of Olympic cultural activities both within respective Games and at IOC level. A 2017 study \( **3.4**\) focused more closely on analysing Cultural Olympiad branding and promotional frameworks. It made recommendations such as the use of consistent hashtags to raise awareness of cultural activities associated with the Games. 

 Our programme of research also examined how the CO impacts on the branding, cultural infrastructure and communities of host cities. García and Cox’s 2013 research on the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad \( **3.5**\) revealed that it encouraged visitors to engage with new locations and tourist attractions across the UK; encouraged young people to produce and participate in cultural activities in new ways; and advanced the disability arts movement. It also examined the cultural governance of London 2012 and how it had evolved after the 2008 Beijing Games. It highlighted how the lack of a single management structure for the CO impeded the development and delivery of a clear vision, and that the lack of a dedicated central budget for culture meant that funder conditions were not always aligned with the CO core vision. 

 Further research on the cultural policy of other global events \( **3.6**\) considered the role of culture in events such as Football World Cups and Universal Expositions, and included recommendations of resourcing and branding that benefit the cultural dimensions of major events beyond the Olympic Games.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The research programme undertaken by Garcia and colleagues has changed the way that cultural programming is valued, planned for, resourced and delivered by the organisers of the Olympic Games and other major events.  We have identified three major beneficiaries of our work: **4.1\)** the International Olympic Committee, **4.2\)** Olympic host cities, and **4.3\)** other major event organisers. To facilitate understanding of the significance and diversity of impacts outlined in this section, find below a visualisation of our key beneficiaries and an abridged reference to key impacts. 



 **4.1 IMPACTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE \(IOC\):** These include changes in awareness and understanding, in policy and strategy, and in staffing. 

 Research by Garcia and her team has **enhanced the way culture is understood, valued and resourced** within the International Olympic Committee. The IOC Head of International Cultural Relations has built directly on Garcia’s work and notes how this research “has improved our knowledge about key issues affecting the delivery of sustainable Olympic cultural programming such as funding, branding and governance” \( **5.1a**\). Moreover, the main IOC Advisor for Public Engagement notes how this research has “inform\[ed\] the … Olympic Movement regarding the potential for culture to play a greater role at future Games” in order to drive and diversify engagement with the Games \( **5.1b**\). Remarkably, in response to the research findings on the lack of visibility and weight given to the Cultural Olympiad \( **3.1**\), the Olympic Museum in Lausanne \(with 300,000 visitors per year\) created for the first time a permanent exhibit about the outstanding achievements of past Cultural Olympiads \(see **5.2**\), all directly informed by Garcia’s research. 

 Since August 2013, the International Olympic Committee’s improved understanding of the relevance of culture has resulted in increased emphasis on – and greater resources for – cultural planning and programming, evident in two additional types of impact: 

 First, **new policies and strategies for culture** at IOC level, evidenced in at least two key documents \( *On\-site Experience*, **5.3** and *Action Plan,* **5.4a**\). As a result of our recommendations, by 2019, the IOC Games department explicitly refers to the Cultural Olympiad \(CO\) as a distinctive dimension of the “Games experience” \(see the strategic document visualisation entitled *Olympic Games On\-site Fan Experience*, **5.3\).** Previously, in Games planning, explicit references to culture featured only in passing and there was no direct CO reference. The Public Engagement Advisor to the IOC noted how our research programme led to a “focus on culture and the arts as a tool for public engagement and legacy \[which\] has contributed to a wider shift in Olympic policy”, that now “gives a higher priority to such \[culture\] factors in the planning and execution of future Olympic Games” \( **5.1b**\). Moreover, the IOC Head of International Cultural Relations writes that “Dr Garcia’s work has informed the IOC’s International Cultural Relations team decision to advance a new *Cultural Action Plan”* \( **5.1a**\). The same source notes, “key recommendations adopted by the team include the benefit of using a consistent hashtag to identify activities, i.e. \#OlympicArt” \( **5.1a**\). The implementation of such principles is evident in the Buenos Aires 2018 and Lausanne 2020 Youth Olympic Games, where IOC\-supported cultural activity was more clearly visible, and its traceability via social media was far stronger than in any previous Games edition, where dedicated Olympic culture hashtags did not exist \( **5.4b**\). 

 Secondly, our research brought about **new expert roles and changes in the functions of existing IOC staff**. As the IOC Head of International Cultural Relations has confirmed, our research “enabled the Games department to recognize the value of providing IOC\-led operational support to the Cultural Olympiad programme. This has resulted in a range of new staffing and specialist advisory developments” \( **5.1a**\). This includes i\) the expansion of the IOC Head of Engagement’s remit to include the direct supervision of Cultural Olympiad planning in coordination with respective Games organizing committees \(see section 4.2, below\), and ii\) the appointment of the first dedicated Cultural Consultant to the IOC, with Garcia chosen into this pioneering role in 2019. The Head of International Cultural Relations notes that our research also “directly influenced the decision to include, for the first time, experts in arts programming as part of the IOC’s Culture and Olympic Heritage Commission” \( **5.1a**\). This took place in 2015, with Garcia being appointed as one of these experts, alongside the then director of the V&A in London, Martin Roth, and BBC Director Tony Hall \(see full Commission members list: **5.5**\). 

 **4.2 IMPACTS ON OLYMPIC HOST CITIES:** This research has directly impacted on the way Olympic host cities set targets for the Cultural Olympiad and set joint cultural strategy plans between local stakeholders. This is amply apparent in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. 

 Our research findings \(in particular, **3.5**\) have set the basis for the Cultural Olympiad **targets and impact indicators of Tokyo 2020**. This is evidenced in the policy planning documents produced by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government \( **5.6**\) which directly implement our recommendations as programming goals and priority actions for these Games. The Tokyo 2020 Deputy Director for Culture notes that our research findings “helped \[the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee Culture team\] determine the direction of the \[…\] Games cultural programme” \( **5.7**\). More specifically, he asserts that our work enabled the Tokyo Organising Committee for the Games to set “performance indicators and targets that helped \[them\] justify significant funding and the strategic positioning of culture as part of the Games delivery” \( **5.7**\). The same source added that without those targets ""the Cultural Olympiad would have remained a secondary priority” \( **5.7**\). 

 Our London 2012 findings and recommendations also underpin the **new joint cultural strategy for the boroughs hosting Paris 2024**. As noted by the Seine Saint Denis Director of Culture, our research and recommendations \(see **3.5**\) “guide\[d\] \[his team and key stakeholders\] in the decision\-making on cooperation and the design of partnership projects” and “enabled \[his local authority\] to make the teams in charge of cultural policy and sports policy better understand what a cultural Olympiad is” and how it can be a catalyst for local strategic development, in the way this took place across the London 2012 Olympic boroughs – e.g., ‘Newham” \( **5.8**\). The importance given to our research and its direct impact on local strategic frameworks is evident in the multiple requests for Garcia to lead specialist workshops and consultations with Paris Seine Saint Denis local authority teams. As the same source notes, consultations conducted in October 2017 and February 2020, with Garcia invited as keynote speaker and advisor, informed the boroughs “in the development of a new joint territorial strategy” \( **5.8**\). This strategy, titled ‘ *Plaine Commune’,* \(see **5.9\)** *,* represents the first time the nine boroughs surrounding the appointed Olympic site work together on a common cultural vision. 

 **4.3 IMPACTS ON OTHER MAJOR EVENTS:** Finally, our research has influenced and redefined approaches to major event delivery and evaluation, beyond the Olympic Games, including events to remember WWI in 2014, the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, the UK City of Culture edition in Hull 2017, and the Edinburgh International Festival. 

 Our research findings, in particular **3.4** and **3.6**, have directly impacted on **major events best practice in terms of policy frameworks, design, planning, delivery and documentation**. This includes the programme of events to remember World War One in 2014, where our work “informed … the structure of the organisation and delivery of the programme” \( **5.1b**\); and events such as the UK City of Culture edition in Hull 2017 and the Edinburgh International Festival, where our research helped “make decisions informed by the experience of cities and events elsewhere” \( **5.10a**\). Further, the Head of Culture at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games affirms that she has used our research “to help define policies and funding programmes in roles \[she has\] taken at Creative Scotland and the Scottish Government”, including the cultural strategy for Glasgow 2014 \( **5.10b**\). The same source adds that our work has encouraged better practices to document and acknowledge both the positive and negative outcomes of events: for instance, rather than ignoring the learnings emerging out of a previous failed event bid, she now builds on them, as specifically recommended by our programme of research \( **5.10b**\). 

 Lastly, our work has directly impacted on **major event evaluation practices, resulting in new  holistic and long\-term evaluations**. As noted by the Edinburgh International Festival Executive Director, prior to our work, amongst event planners and festival organisers, there had been  a “longstanding failure to understand the importance of evaluation to secure … legacy” \( **5.10a**\). The Director of Culture at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games corroborates this by noting that our research has enabled her to understand “how critical research and evaluation are as essential components of any undertaking, regardless of its scale” and has resulted in “new or increased funding for event evaluations” as well as “more meaningful evaluation” processes \( **5.10b**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research on public perceptions of aid, co\-produced with the Strategic Insights Team at the Department for International Development \(DFID\), changed DFID’s communication strategy and how it – and now its successor, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office \(FCDO\) – conducts messaging research. In particular, the research provided new analytical tools that allowed DFID to identify how specific development aid messages resonated with particular segments of the public. This led to alterations in how DFID carries out research as well as changes to DFID’s communication strategy so as to maximize aid support by framing public communications in ways that better connect with public expectations. As a result, this research contributed to the evidence\-base for the UK government’s efforts both to maintain public support for aid spending and pursue national interests associated with being the second largest bi\-lateral aid donor in the world. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The commitment to aid as a crucial part of its foreign policy has made the UK a global leader in international development, placing it at the forefront of responses to global challenges such as climate change, poverty alleviation, and health, while also increasing the UK’s global influence and reach. However, both the commitment and the cost of aid are controversial, therefore it is important to understand what specific segments of the UK public think about aid spending and priorities, and how messages help influence more positive attitudes towards it. 

 This impact case study is underpinned by two interconnected research streams examining public attitudes to aid. Research by Prof. Simon Lightfoot \(2011\-12\) highlighted the challenge faced by government in maintaining support for aid commitments in the face of scepticism and hostility in public opinion and the mainstream media **\[1\]**. This qualitative research identified that the government needed to better communicate the relevance and importance of aid commitments to the public. It argued that, contrary to DFID’s assumptions, a focus on results\-driven communications could be counter\-productive, ultimately weakening development commitments to poverty reduction. These findings overlapped with those of a 2009\-12 ESRC\-funded study by Profs. Graeme Davies \(Leeds\) and Robert Johns \(Essex\) on British public attitudes to foreign policy **\[a\]**. This research included unique survey questions that asked respondents whether British foreign aid should be allocated on the basis of recipient need or UK national interest. Significant results suggested a greater resonance with national interest narratives **\[2\-4\]**. These projects came together via a co\-authored blog post in 2015 **\[5\]** and a joint conference paper given at the University of Essex in 2016 **\[6\]**, where the national interest/need question attracted the attention of the then DFID Head of Strategic Insights. 

 Contemporaneously, the November 2015 government white paper ‘ [UK aid: tackling global challenges in the national interest](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aid-tackling-global-challenges-in-the-national-interest)’ set out a new strategy for UK aid with an explicit focus on the ‘national interest’. DFID had to ensure they communicated the national interest aspect of this new strategy. As a result, DFID commissioned a bespoke co\-produced research project with Lightfoot, Davies and Johns \(funded by Leeds and Essex Impact Acceleration Accounts **\[b\]**\) to test its current narratives about aid, and to identify and refine a more effective communications strategy around national interest. 

 To investigate the problem of communicating value\-for\-money versus national interest framing, the research team drew upon earlier experimental methodologies developed by Davies and Johns, which demonstrated that communication strategies are well\-placed to influence public opinion \(and informed the DFID research design\) **\[a\]**. These experiments provided a well\-validated method to test the effect of those messages **\[2\-4\]**. The research tested Lightfoot’s theoretical assumptions about the role of messaging **\[1\]**, showing how the presentation of information by the government has a significant effect on public attitudes towards international affairs **\[2\-4\]**. This research formed the foundation of the subsequent co\-designed research collaboration with the Insight Team and the Communications Insight and Evaluation Advisor at DFID in 2016\-17 **\[b\]**. Via a series of consultations with DFID, Lightfoot contributed to the research question design whilst Davies designed the final survey and led refinement efforts related to national interest narratives and the messages DFID wanted to test. The team conducted analysis and presented the findings to DFID, with Lightfoot and Davies leading continued engagement efforts, resulting in the impact detailed below. Recommendations derived from the research included that DFID should avoid messages discussing its budget, value for money, expenditure justifications, complex aid rationales, or the need to relate all aid back to internal UK outcomes. Instead, communications should focus on tangible aid outcomes, positive stories, and health aid; and that it should be targeted to apprehensive audiences/media outlets with national messaging related to aid and security, which was seen to generate higher public approval with aid\-sceptics and those only ‘marginally engaged’.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The main beneficiary of the underpinning research has been DFID, which: i\) changed how DFID conducted messaging research, and; ii\) influenced its communication strategy, helping it to better make the case for aid spending to the UK public. The co\-produced research provided evidence that was used to justify internal resource allocation at DFID and beyond, with the research recommendations incorporated into toolkits on how to communicate about aid and national interest, which, the then Director of Communications at DFID explains, are *‘now used as part of \[DFID’s\] guidance to those who work on aid communications across government’* **\[A\]**. 

 **i\) Changing research practices and building capacity at DFID** 

 Close and sustained co\-operation between the academics and the team at DFID was crucial for providing the Department with the necessary capacity for designing, implementing and analysing public opinion research, and has offered a new model for how it conducts research and creates evidence\-bases for policymakers. As part of the research design phase, the research team introduced DFID to new experimental designs **\[a,6\]** that could allow pinpointed testing of various demographic groups so as to test specific messages in relation to those particular audiences. This allowed for greater nuance in determining how various groups respond to aid messaging, which had not been available previously to DFID’s Insight Team. In response, DFID invited Davies and collaborators to co\-produce a customized survey with DFID’s Insight Team. Between 17 February 2016 and 16 March 2017, Davies led two survey design meetings, one additional remote meeting, and over 50 email exchanges with DFID so as to develop experiments that reflected their exact communication interests. DFID worked closely with the academics at every stage – designing the project, drafting the questionnaires, analysing the data, and reporting the results. DFID invited Davies and Johns to lead additional refinement efforts to test out various narratives for DFID, specifically those related to economic interests, international leadership, health security and related messages. 

 By the end of this period the research team jointly produced a series of messages that were then used in a pilot study which was fielded by Prolific \(a company which recruits survey participants\) amongst a section of the British public **\[B\]**. A report on these initial findings led to further refinement of the messages that were then tested in a nationally representative sample in January 2017 by the public opinion firm BMG **\[C\]**. According to the Director of Communications at DFID, this research was *‘invaluable in helping address a specific need for our communications strategy, namely to better understand how we create messaging that demonstrates the benefits of spending aid to the UK’*. Since DFID itself did *‘not have the budget to gather insight’*, and therefore lacked institutional capacity, the Director adds, *‘without the support of these academics we would not have been able to undertake this testing to inform our message development’* **\[A\]**. Furthermore, DFID’s Communications Team’s approach to carrying out research and using research data was impacted, with the Director stating, *‘as a result of this project we were able to make a case to secure funding from another government department to gather further insight on the topic’* and that the methods they would take from the research team would enable this future research to help them further understand *‘how we can best land these messages with the UK public’* **\[A\]**. The insights generated, along with the subsequent research mentioned above, has also been used to train and upskill government communications colleagues for use in social media, ministerial statements, and press lines **\[A,H\]**. 

 **ii\) Changing messaging on national interest at DFID** 

 The research subsequently influenced DFID’s framing of aid in terms of national interests and led to changes in their messaging, enabling challenging audiences to be reached. The findings were communicated at meetings at DFID \(October 2017\) and via a presentation to DFID’s communication team on the 15 December 2017 **\[E\]**. This meeting included the Head of Strategy and Insight, the Insight, Evaluation and Branding Advisor, and the Senior Communications Manager. In response to recommendations from the team, DFID changed their messaging strategy as detailed below. 

 The research highlighted the importance of a focus on health security, since this has the greatest overall public approval results. A former Communications Insight and Evaluation Advisor at DFID explains that this insight *‘was shared with the \[Communications\] division to help understand how communicating about health security could contribute to ministerial priorities to discuss the national interest, reinforcing existing insight, and adding further understanding to how the department can use health security messaging to talk about UK aid in the national interest’* **\[F\]**. This was put into practice during the 2019  [\#100WaysAidWorks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100WaysAidWorks?src=hashtag_click) social media campaign, where specific examples of health security narratives were used by the Secretary of State for International Development to highlight benefits to the UK **\[A,G\]**. Key indicators of the successes of the \#100WaysAidsWorks campaign were an average of 21,617 impressions per tweet \(range of 4,201\-45,691\) with an average 1.033 engagement rate \(range of 0.39\-2.46\). There was also engagement internationally across country offices – 432 retweets from country offices or international stakeholders and the messages prompting stakeholder participation including: Centre for Disease Control Group, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Unilever, British Council, GAVI Alliance, London Zoo, Gates Foundation, VSO, UNICEF and more. According to DFID, this number and range of engagement was *‘higher than the average engagement with DFID Twitter content’* **\[G\]**. 

 The research recommendations outlined that targeting certain audiences, namely the ‘marginally engaged’ on aid, with national security messages is very productive in generating their approval. This group is generally sceptical about aid yet can be won round by messages that focus on threats to the UK. This was *‘a new insight’* for DFID and added to guidance for communicating with this core audience **\[F\]**. Additionally, there is a need for positive narratives about specific projects with tangible outputs, without foregrounding budgeting and expenditure. The former Communications Insight and Evaluation Advisor explains that this ‘reinforced current insight \(…\) indicating that focussing on storytelling on an individual level works more effectively than \[a focus on\] money spent’  \[F\]** *.  The study also found that some messages previously used by the DFID team were too indirect to be understood by the public. For example, the causal linkage between aid in Ethiopia and jobs in the UK was too complex to communicate effectively. These research recommendations informed the production of national media\-targeted campaigns picked up by national newspapers in 2019, where DFID’s 'major headlines'  \- those issues and messages highlighted as having greatest resonance with the public \- were repeated. This led to increases in social media traffic supportive of the UK government maintaining and justifying its aid commitments. DFID has provided examples from this campaign **\[H\]**, including stories about spending its overseas aid budget on the fight against child sex tourism, which was reported in the *Times* \(April 2019\), and how British law enforcement is accessing the overseas aid budget for countering extremism in Africa, linked to the terrorism threat in the UK, which was reported in the *Sun* \(March 2019\). The *Sun* article maintained a focus on national security, the primary concern of the marginally engaged, and on a specific project, whilst only making general claims about the benefits to the UK. Meanwhile, the announcement of the ‘What Works – Impact at Scale’ initiative funded by DFID, which aims to scale up effective interventions, test innovations, and influence a more effective global response to preventing violence against women and girls, resulted in an article in the *Guardian* \(November 2019\) with a strong national interest headline, where expenditure is mentioned only in the subheading \(reflecting study recommendations\), and a positive in\-depth article about multiple UK aid successes **\[H\]**. 

 The research recommendations have been incorporated into *‘a specific “communicating in the national interest” pack. This has been presented to the communications division and discussed with other departmental colleagues, with the core message for the division being to focus on making national interest messaging credible’* **\[F\]**. This guidance directly informed the work of approximately 50 staff working in DFID communications as well as communications teams in other departments drawing on the overseas aid budget, together with relevant teams, such as DFID colleagues working on jobs and prosperity programmes in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Trade. Thus, the impact of this research can be understood to have affected the day\-to\-day work of the Department in drafting ministerial statements, media lines, and providing advice to special advisers, Cabinet Office, and relevant ministers **\[D\]**. The new Secretary of State for International Development was briefed using the revised guidance when starting at the department in 2019, improving their understanding of how both they, and the Department, can effectively communicate in the national interest \(see ‘\#100WaysAidWorks’ above\) **\[A\]**. 

 Following the merger of DFID with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office in 2020, a Communication Manager at the new Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office \(FCDO\) explains that *‘the insights gained via this research now inform the wider comms strategy of the FCDO and are as relevant as they were before, potentially more so given emphasis in the prime minister’s announcement of the merger of showing how aid is spent in the interests of the UK’* **\[I\]**. The Prime Minister remarked: *‘we must mobilise every one of our national assets, including our aid budget and expertise, to safeguard British interests and values overseas’* **\[J\]**. To that end the research insights are now being shared and used in the new FCDO, including in training those working on aid spending **\[A\]**. 

 Overall, the impact reach of the project can be seen in the fact that all staff writing government lines and ministerial statements are briefed on the national interest via the Communication Division’s guidance, which has shaped aid messaging to the benefit of the UK government **\[A\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Following our ‘Buy Online Return in Store’ project and extensive engagement with industry, loss managers in major UK multiple retailers have reported that our findings have been used to influence senior management to implement changes in practice and processes. They have seen **improved profitability** through greater visibility of hidden costs of online returns and **improved returns management** through adoption of lean management and circular economy approaches. Further, retailers have moved toward integrating returns management into the **wider strategic planning** processes through implementing cross\-functional teams, and changing returns reporting practices and returns policies. Based on our work, the international industry group ECR Retail Loss has changed its research focus and programme to emphasise e\-commerce returns and has commissioned further work based on our findings. 

 Data scientists at one international clothing retailer have also used our cost model as a basis for the development of a new set of calculations for the cost of returns, identifying **potential savings in excess of GBP10million**. Total savings across members of ECR Retail Loss, a global membership organisation of major retailers, are estimated at **GBP55 million** in the two years following the report. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Many traditional retailers now offer the shopper an omni\-channel experience. Products purchased online may be returned by multiple channels e.g. post, courier or to a physical store. However, offering this customer choice comes at a cost to the retailer with the increased complexities this brings to processes, IT systems, accounting systems and logistics, to name just a few. **Research by Jack and her team investigated the “buy online, return to store” scenario to identify the true cost of returns**. The work has been timely, as online returns in the UK are predicted to increase by 27.3% in the next five years and hit a total of GBP5.6 billion by 2023, according to analysts GlobalData. In 2020, because of the COVID\-19 pandemic, this has become a major problem for retailers with more shopping online, and more returns made through costlier routes as stores have been closed. 

 Jack is recognised internationally as a research\-consultant, writer and speaker on accounting and fraud in food supply chains. She has led projects for the Chartered Association of Management Accountants and the Food Standards Agency, as well as for commercial and non\-governmental organisations in the industry.  This brought her work to the attention of the ECR Retail Loss group in 2014, beginning a collaboration which is still ongoing. With Frei and Krzyzaniak, she brought expertise on costing and sustainable supply chains to bear on issues of interest to ECR Retail Loss and has been able to build on her theoretical interests in how the way in which accounting is communicated can change business practices. 

 The research on reverse logistics was developed with ECR Retail Loss \(formerly the ECR Community Shrink and On Shelf Availability Group\) \( **G1**\), globally recognised in the industry as the leading “think tank” on retail loss.  Their e\-commerce working group was established in 2015, to examine all aspects of e\-commerce loss, with an initial focus on the cost of returns. The combined turnover of 20\+ organisations represented in this working group exceeds GBP400 billion, and includes retailers such as Amazon, Adidas, Bol.com, John Lewis, Tesco, M&S and TJX Europe. Jack and her team were chosen on the merits of their proposal and the team’s expertise in reverse supply chain management \( **R3** and **R5**\). 

 The project consisted of four in\-depth studies of UK multiple retailers involving interviews, site visits and documentary evidence; 17 telephone interviews with loss managers in other retail firms and a desk study of 100 returns policies and over 20 industry reports. The qualitative case\-study based research builds a rich and detailed set of data from which Jack and her team were able to develop process maps \(Frei and Krzyzaniak\), a costing model \(Jack\), proposals for a lean returns management process \(Jack\) and circular economy strategies \(Frei\) \( **R1** and **R2**\). Jack and her team presented the interim results to the ECR community at their regular meetings to “triangulate” findings and strengthen their applicability across the retail sector. 

 Key findings were that multiple returns paths are offered to customers, bringing complexity to businesses and additional costs. The “route” of returns within the business is complex, depending on product type, value, where it is returned, the condition of the returned product \(e.g. if it is damaged\) and this builds **significant costs and inefficiencies into current returns processes**. One reason for this is that online businesses have generally been “bolted onto” existing bricks and mortar businesses, with system gaps being patched up. The “patchwork quilt” of systems is inefficient and increases vulnerability, but businesses have been unable to make a case for new, harmonised systems. As a result, few businesses currently collect or process data to give an accurate cost of returns, let alone cost of returns for their online business. It is estimated that the rate of returns for online sales is 22% on average, compared with 8% for bricks and mortar sales, and can be higher than 50% for luxury goods and holiday purchases. Their research showed that the cost of returns averaged around GBP7\-12 per returned item. A very small reduction in the rate of returns can achieve increases in net profits of 100\-200 basis points. 

 Their **recommendations** fall into three key areas that link directly to impact. First, they recommended that their **model for the cost of returns** should be implemented to improve profitability through greater visibility of hidden costs of online returns. The model can be used to demonstrate to senior management the need to concentrate on reducing the rate of return as the most effective means of enhancing profit. This included the finding that return to store was the most cost\-effective route, and that returns should be seen as a profit, not a cost centre.  The model was shown to provide better data capture and an improved analysis of cost of returns. The research also recommended improved communications with customers to prevent returns and the removal of transaction steps from the returns management process to reduce costs \( **R2**\). 

 Second, the team recommended the **adoption of lean management and circular economy approaches to improve returns management**. Both concepts are timely and relevant in the context of the retail sector because of their potential for improved profitability \( **R4**\). 

 Third, Jack and team identified the need for **implementing cross\-functional teams** and executive manager oversight of the returns process as best practice for the **integration of returns into strategic planning**. Loss prevention teams need to gain support from executive officers for **changes in return policies and practices** \( **R1**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The online returns research started in early 2017 with data collection finished by October 2017. Further work was then undertaken to develop the cost model and validate it with stakeholders through workshops organised by ECR. The report, together with its recommendations, was published online in January 2019 and has since been downloaded 59 times including by 19 retailers with annual turnovers between GBP10 million and GBP10 billion from UK, Europe, Russia and the USA, six manufacturers and industry associations from Europe and the USA and 16 solution providers from the UK and Europe. ECR Retail Loss launched a new website in late summer 2020, and an open access version of the report has been made available \( **R1**\). 

 **Building engagement with the research through industry events and media** 

 ECR Retail Loss have run several events to help their members implement the recommendations from the research. The events included a first Webinar on 12 February 2019 \( **S1**\) hosted by ECR Retail Loss, translating the research insights into strategic implications for businesses. The webinar included a representative of \[text removed for publication\] who elaborated upon how the report was used by senior management to alter their returns management policy so as to focus on the profitability of returns \( **S1**\). In all, 61 people registered for the Webinar from Europe, the USA, Russia, Brazil, Australia and Kazakhstan. Feedback included the following comment from the USA, \[text removed for publication\]: *“Very interesting work that the team has assembled – including highlighting the cost of the CREDIT CARD transaction as a cost of the return; I have not heard that in any discussion including Walmart, US Industry Groups or other areas \(truly insightful\)”* \( **S2**\). 

 Loss Prevention Magazine \(28 March 2019\) ran a feature on the back of the report. The team also disseminated the results through an article in The Conversation \(21 January 2019\), which achieved 61,500 hits and 47 reprints, translated into Indonesian and Romanian \( **S3**\). Jack has been invited to present the work on this project to: the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants Irish Spring Seminar in Cork on 6 March 2020; in an international online seminar for AICPA/CIMA Ireland on 19 November 2020 for practising accountants along with the lead accountant for returns in a major online retailer \(annual turnover GBP80 million in Ireland\); and a webinar with the University of Sheffield on reverse logistics recorded by AICPA\-CIMA in Summer 2020. 

 Following the first webinar on 12 February 2019, ECR Retail Loss also organised a workshop for a wider stakeholder group on 2 April 2019 in London that led to a selected group of retailers requesting an additional workshop on 25 April 2019 to discuss the implementation of the cost of returns model specifically. 22 representatives from 14 major UK, European and North American retailers attended, along with ECR Community grant providers and industry representatives, with 75% saying that the event met or exceeded their expectations \(see **S2**\). 

 **Improved profitability through greater visibility of hidden costs of online returns** 

 According to Colin Peacock, Strategy Coordinator of ECR Retail Loss, the true cost of returns model “has **delivered an estimated GBP55 million to the bottom line profits**” **to their members** in the two years following the publication of the report in January 2019. He further states that Jack’s research “remains one of the most important pieces of research we have undertaken, and its relevance and importance is now more relevant than ever with the growth of e\-commerce.” \( **S4**\). 

 In addition to the workshops mentioned earlier, ECR Retail Loss organised another workshop for its members in 15 July 2019 based on the report \( **R1**\). An important part of the impact strategy was to provide a space in which retailers could share experiences of similar and growing issues with online returns, which fed into reviews of returns policies across the sector in 2019/20 \( **S4**\) **.** One major retailer later responded to say that the findings from the report and workshop had made a significant impact on their review and initiatives for managing returns \( **S5**\). 

 The workshop was attended by loss managers from four UK, one Spanish and one South African based companies with average annual turnovers of between GBP0.8 billion and GBP56 billion. The workshop took place in the \[text removed for publication\] of an **international clothing retailer** \(annual international turnover of GBP900 million\) in \[text removed for publication\] on 3 July 2020 and focused on the implementation of the new cost model. The same retailer then set up an NDA with the University of Portsmouth to test and develop the cost model. The data analytics team used the new cost model as a starting point to demonstrate to senior management that customers making returns in store was significantly more cost\-effective than any other means of return, something that had not previously been apparent and which would change customer interactions. Subsequently, the international clothing retailer “used the model to inform a change of returns strategy that has **led to a GBP10 million saving to the bottom line**” \( **S4**\). 

 Furthermore, the retailer stated that by using the cost model they identified that encouraging customers to return to store rather than by post **could realise circa GBP1 million in a further reduction of costs to return goods in a full year**. This information is still being reviewed to highlight further benefits to the business \( **S6**\). During the covid\-19 pandemic, ECR Retail Loss reported that several of their members have leveraged the model to account for the increased cost of returns being sent to fulfilment centres rather than being returned in store, enabling budget write offs to be estimated. Increased rates of return and the closures of stores will therefore increase the cost of returns and drive further innovation in this field \( **S3**\). 

 In addition, the University of Portsmouth is negotiating an NDA with a European logistics company with an annual turnover of GBP60 billion who will begin a similar data analysis investigation based on our cost model in 2021. As a result of reading the report and follow\-up conversations, one software company in Portsmouth also developed concepts for new products \( **S7**\). These are expected to be introduced through 2021 in the previously mentioned international clothing retailer and the European logistics company. 

 In September 2020, ECR Retail Loss asked Jack to extend the cost model into an online self\-assessment tool and to adapt the model to the cost of food waste to retailers \( **S4**\). 

 **Improved returns management through adoption of lean management and circular economy approaches** 

 A smaller, invited group of ECR Retail Loss members was convened by ECR on 23 January 2020 at the headquarters of one of the major UK retailers. \[text removed for publication\] from that group have said that the research has been a definite prompt and input to change in their organisations, as well as enabling them personally to feel more confident in developing their evidence to present to company leaders \( **S8**\). A \[text removed for publication\], working for a British fashion retailer with a turnover of around GBP1.8million, explained how the  research helped them to engage with senior management to assess the potential of various changes in their current systemic and operational processes and procedures for handling digital web returns. This involved incrementally assessing all contributing factors to the operational cost and customer mindset when returning goods. Particularly during the COVID\-19 crisis, the research helped companies to implement new procedures that changed the way their customer care and warehouse teams worked with customer returns, leading to a stronger business model during an unprecedented trading year \( **S8**\). 

 ECR Retail Loss organised another workshop for a wider stakeholder group with a focus on how technology can help with returns management, which took place online on 15 July 2020 and was attended by retailers with annual turnovers of between GBP1 billion and GBP400 billion. ECR Retail Loss reported that the series of workshops has enabled retailers to share best practice and build capacity. In addition, they have changed their workshop programmes to increase their promotion of work around the returns process with the aim of ‘selling more and wasting less’ and to integrate a circular economy which was not previously on the agenda for research \( **S4**\). 

 **Integrating returns management into wider strategic planning processes through cross\-functional teams and changed returns reporting practices and returns policies** 

 One of the key issues identified in the research is the lack of cross\-functional teams and Executive Director oversight of the returns process. A very serious concern of the loss prevention managers interviewed \( **R1**\) was the difficulty in getting investment and intervention to mitigate returns because of the lack of involvement of other sections of their organisation. Through ECR Retail Loss the new cost model has been communicated at board level in the majority of retailers and that several retailers have already implemented cross\-functional teams to tackle the growing rate of returns \( **S4**\). ECR Retail Loss also report that others have leveraged the model to make significant changes to the way in which returns are managed, such as changing the threshold value for free deliveries \( **S4**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Dr Joyce \(Zhe\) Jiang, a specialist in employment relations at the University of York, increased understanding of the plight of migrant domestic workers \(MDWs\) as a form of modern slavery. It also demonstrated how ‘participatory art’ can help groups such as MDWs mobilize themselves and acquire collective identity and purpose. MDWs in London worked with Jiang to develop a video documentary highlighting their experiences, which was exhibited at galleries and museums across the UK. Through participatory art, Jiang has helped MDWs: raise public awareness of their plight; empower themselves and their associations towards improving terms and conditions; and advance the campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Jiang at the University of York \(UoY\) has significantly contributed to understanding the experiences of migrant domestic workers \(MDWs\), and how they might use participatory art to collectively organize themselves to campaign for improved terms and conditions and influence policy. In the UK, there is growing concern that the decline in traditional labour organizing and collective bargaining has left large numbers of workers vulnerable to intensified forms of exploitation. This is especially the case with MDWs, such as, nannies, cooks and cleaners who live in accommodation provided by their employer. Typically, MDWs are not members of unions and do not benefit from the protection of domestic employment laws. 

 Drawing on insights from employment relations and the sociology of work, Jiang’s research has helped to understand the experiences of these workers as a form of modern slavery. A survey of MDWs conducted in early 2019, by Jiang at UoY, revealed that 59% suffered from physical, verbal or sexual abuse at work, and also that a majority of employers did not comply with the National Minimum Wage **\[A\]**. In the employment relations literature, it is often assumed that groups such as MDWs, isolated in the homes of their employers, lack a collective identity and are hard to organize in conventional ways that could improve working conditions, for example, through membership of unions. However, in earlier work \(prior to joining York in 2016\), Jiang \(with Korczynski, University of Nottingham\) had challenged the assumption that MDWs were ‘un\-organizable’ and highlighted ways in which these workers can mobilize themselves to articulate their shared experiences and pursue collective interests. 

 Research conducted at York by Jiang built on these ideas to explore how ‘participatory art’ can be a powerful tool in collective organizing. Key ideas were developed in *‘The art of labour organizing’*, published in the leading journal *Human Relations* **\[B\]**. Jiang explores the role that ‘participatory art’ can play in supporting and enhancing *‘flat organizing,’* which she defines as a process that emerges from social relationships between workers interacting with each other in the wider community. Examples include social movements or grassroots protest groups that \(initially at least\) have no formal leadership or structure. In the employment context, flat organizing might occur when groups of workers come together informally and develop a sense of community, initially without the help of trades unions. Jiang’s interest in participatory art was partly inspired by the critical mass of researchers at York, led by Professor Stephen Linstead, interested in the role of aesthetics for understanding organizations and the relationships between art and research. Using an in depth case study, Jiang uncovered how ‘art practices’ \(e.g. workshops on singing, drawing, painting, writing, acting and constructing and presenting satirical sketches\) can have a significant impact on the ability of groups such as MDWs to associate and develop a collective sense of purpose. Based on these observations she developed an ideal type model for understanding the ‘ *art of flat organizing’* consisting of six elements: participatory art practices; tutor activist roles; distributed leadership; safe spaces; knowing and questioning through art; and empowerment through art. 

 In 2019, Jiang applied and further refined her ideas about the art of flat organizing through a co\-produced project with The Voice of Domestic Workers \(VoDW\), for whom she acts as a trustee. This project involved a participatory video in collaboration with Tassia Kobylinska \- a filmmaker from Goldsmiths \- and a group of MDWs associated with VoDW **\[C\]\[D\]**. Funded by an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant awarded by UoY, twelve MDWs were trained in video production. Organised by Jiang and Kobylinska, this group co\-produced a short documentary video, *Our Journey* **\[D\]**, and curated exhibitions *\(My Home is Not My Home\)* that presented a combination of video installation, photography, artworks and documents in different museums and galleries across the UK \(including: in London, L’etrangere, Stephen Lawrence Gallery, Cubitt Gallery Goldsmiths and Unite the Union; in York, Norman Rea Gallery; and in Manchester, People’s History Museum\). As a form of ‘participatory art’ in action, the co\-produced film, *Our Journey* **\[D\]** and the associated exhibitions helped MDWs organize themselves and to articulate their interests to politicians and public audiences. 

 In research terms, observations and insights from the VoDW project enabled refinement and increased understanding of the process and outcomes of ‘participatory art’ in supporting flat organizing and the working lives of MDWs **\[E\]\[F\]**. Most recently, this work has continued with additional funding awarded in 2020 by Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women \(GAATW\) to further research the plight of MDWs, their experiences of modern slavery and the ways they are organizing themselves to campaign for improved terms and conditions.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 To date Jiang’s research has had an impact in three key areas: **\(a\)** raising public awareness of the plight of MDWs; **\(b\)** using participatory art practices to empower MDWs and help them organize to improve their terms and conditions; and **\(c\)** informing the ongoing campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system. 

 <ins>Enhanced public awareness</ins> – Following exhibitions in multiple galleries and museums between 2019 and 2020, Jiang’s research has helped to raise public and media awareness of the plight of MDWs. By December 2020 Jiang’s exhibitions had attracted 1,300 visitors nationally, despite the cancellation of events after March 2020, due to the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[1\]**. Evidence from feedback interviews and surveys reveals that the exhibitions have improved public understanding of the plight of MDWs and the need for reforming the system **\[1\]**. In exhibition questionnaires, a majority of visitors \(in some cases 100%\) responded positively to questions such as: *‘I felt moved or inspired’, ‘I was exposed to new ways of thinking about things’, ’It made me want to know more about what I was seeing’ and ‘I will use/share things learnt today*’ **\[1\]**. Words that recur in visitor’s comments’ books and interviews are *‘moving’, ‘important’, ‘enlightening’, ‘insightful’, ‘powerful’, ‘shocking’ and ‘informative’*. Some visitors expressed astonishment that ‘modern slavery’ still existed in the UK. One visitor, for example, stated: *‘I think it’s so surprising and disgraceful in this age that people are treated in a way that these workers have been treated. They are not considered as workers really. They are considered as slaves in modern society.’* A different visitor remarked on how it was: *‘a really shocking exhibition. I had an idea of what has been happening…\[the\] abuses, but not to this extent’*, while, according to another, it was: ‘ *A very inspiring and mind\-blowing exhibition that reveals an aspect of modern life that has always been overlooked’*. Others were able to connect the exhibition to their own immediate family experiences and recognised the importance of collective organizing: *‘my mum left the Philippines as a domestic worker – I don’t think she has had the opportunity to share her story and her pain with people who have been through the same – I can only imagine how much it helps to join in solidarity through organisations like VoDW’* **\[1\]**. An article published in the *Guardian* on the L’Etrangere exhibition and a feature on Resonance FM radio both assisted in raising public awareness of the exhibition and the issue **\[2\]**. 

 <ins>Empowering MDWs through participatory art</ins><ins>:</ins> In line with her foundational research **\[B\]**, the participatory art project directed by Jiang to produce the documentary video and exhibitions has supported ‘flat organizing’ by giving the MDWs a voice \- as individuals, through unionization and by connecting them to non\-traditional actors, such as museum curators. 

 First, it helped to empower the 12 individual MDWs who were directly involved in the art project, raising their willingness and ability to campaign on behalf of other co\-workers. Feedback suggested that for many it was a transformative experience which significantly improved their skills and confidence. A typical comment from participants was: *‘We learnt a lot. It's priceless, knowledge and bonding every week.*', while another remarked: *‘to be part of this project…I was so grateful because at last, we can express ourselves. We let other people hear our voices, our struggles.*' **\[3\]**. Five participants subsequently became active campaigners, representing their community by volunteering and speaking at public events. As the chair of VoDW stated: *‘Some women have developed important media skills from the participatory video series. They have become very active in representing the community in various media platforms. The skills learnt in the workshops have been spilled over to other progressive activities.*' **\[4\]**. 

 Second, the video and exhibitions helped to raise the awareness of a wider constituency of MDWs, mobilising support for the VoDW which campaigns for equal employment rights and reform of the visa system \(see below\). Jiang’s research helped boost membership of VoDW to 1500 by December 2020. This is confirmed by the VoDW Chairperson, who noted: *‘The video training has attracted…new members for us. We have also received enquiries from domestic workers who wanted to join our organization after visiting Joyce’s exhibition.’* **\[4\]**. Amongst these new members are the 12 MDWs involved in the video, one of whom is now leading the media and communication working group within VoDW. 

 A further way in which Jiang’s research has helped to empower MDWs is by facilitating union membership and changing the way that unions engage with this group: As the VoDW Chairperson explained: *‘Joyce’s research has informed our discussion with Unite the Union to establish a domestic worker branch within the union...Without her research, this will not happen so quickly’* **\[4\]**. These discussions led to a week\-long event \(starting Monday 9 March 2020\), just prior to the first Covid\-19 lockdown, hosted by Unite the Union at Unite House in Holborn \(London\). This event, attended by Unite Executive Council members, included a screening of the film followed by presentations by Jiang and MDWs themselves. Feedback from it noted how the exhibition had raised awareness and also advanced Unite’s own campaign to organize MDWs and achieve equal employment rights. According to the National Officer for the Hospitality Service Sector within Unite the Union: *‘This video will increase awareness and elicit wider support for their campaign to be afforded the same fundamental rights as any other worker’* **\[5\]**. The Unite Assistant General Secretary also writes: *‘This event raised awareness and strengthened union organisation, demonstrating to migrant domestic workers that they are not alone, and that they are supported by the union alongside a wide alliance of organisations and individuals.*’ Furthermore, she notes how: *‘The film has played, and is playing, a vital role in union campaigning with migrant domestic workers...supporting union organising...and bringing together all those who want to make change’* **\[5\]**. The impact of Jiang’s work in helping to empower and mobilize MDWs is further acknowledged by a spokesperson for the Trades Union Congress, who states: *'Allowing domestic workers to tell their stories themselves in her \[Jiang’s\] video starts to give these workers the power to challenge the injustices they have suffered and shows how workers organising in unions has helped to overcome their exploitation’  \[10\]**. Overall, Jiang’s work is significant in helping to broaden the focus of unions which, traditionally, had not sought to recruit and organize marginalized groups such as MDWs. 

 Third, the research directly supported flat organizing by helping to forge new links with non\-traditional actors such as gallery and museum curators who are now supporting the work of VoDW. As the curator from Cubitt Gallery stated: *‘The film brought new audiences and conversations to Cubitt and is a great example of how art can work across and with different communities.’* **\[6\]**. Cubitt gallery and Raven Row gallery have also agreed to provide free venues for VoDW’s meetings and workshop activities in the future. Curator of the Cubitt gallery stated, *“studio spaces have been made available to support the group’s \[VoDW\] ongoing work”* and this *“sharing space at Cubitt is key to developing forms of solidarity and knowledge exchange in relation to work, education, precarity and collective organizing”* **\[6\]**. 

 <ins>Campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system:</ins> Jiang’s research and work on the video has informed and energized a wider campaign led by VoDW, Unite the Union, Kalayaan and Anti\-slavery to reinstate the pre\-2012 Overseas Domestic Worker Visa \(ODW visa\). Before 2012, MDWs were allowed to renew their visa provided that they would be continuously hired as full\-time domestic workers and, after five years, apply for indefinite leave to remain and eventually UK citizenship. However, in 2012, the UK Government removed these rights to renew, greatly increasing the insecurity and vulnerability of MDWs. The campaign to reverse this decision has achieved national media attention, partly as a result of the film and exhibitions that have raised awareness **\[2\]**. Jiang’s survey report, commissioned by VoDW **\[A\]**, provided robust evidence of modern slavery which also directly informed this campaign. Specifically, the exhibitions and film increased politicians’ awareness of the plight of MDWs in the UK. As the EU & Europe manager of Anti\-Slavery International noted, ‘ *The film gives space to individuals to tell their story in their words, with dignity...it is also a homage to all that domestic workers themselves have achieved and continue to fight for’* **\[7\]**. Similarly, the former Labour MP Fiona MacTaggart noted: *‘the wonderful thing about this exhibition and the video…is a very intimate description of the horrible exploitations which so many migrant domestic workers are subjected to. They are forced to a form of slavery which is not acceptable in the UK today. All of us should do more to help them.’* **\[8\]**. 

 As a result of increasing publicity arising from Jiang’s report **\[A\]**, the participatory art project and growing media attention, in late 2019 Jiang was asked to help draft a Parliamentary Briefing to inform MPs and policy makers of the vulnerability and marginality of MDWs in the UK and the problems associated with the current ODW Visa **\[9\]**. This led to Jiang being invited to speak at the campaign launch event hosted and chaired by Labour Party MP Jess Phillips. Originally planned for April 2020 in the House of Commons, this event was postponed due to Covid and finally held, virtually, on 17 November. It was attended by 115 people including MPs and the Prevention Policy lead of the Modern Slavery Unit within the Home Office. Feedback from the meeting further highlighted the impact of Jiang’s work in raising awareness and how this was helping to boost the campaign to reinstate the ODW visa. Jess Phillips \(MP\), for example, remarked: *'It has been incredibly insightful ... we will certainly try to improve the situation which I don't know how anyone who hears this could think it's not wrong.'* **\[10\]** The Policy Officer \(Rights, International, Social and Economics department\) for the Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) further commented on how *‘Joyce Jiang's video and research’* not only represented *‘an important resource’* to raise awareness, but also ‘ *supports the TUC's advocacy to change UK law to end the tied overseas domestic workers' visa and end the criminalisation of undocumented workers.'* **\[10\]**. Although this campaign to reinstate the visa was interrupted by the pandemic, it is regaining momentum and political support following the parliamentary event in November. This is due in large part to Jiang’s research and wider public engagement. As the Director of VoDW stated: *''Joyce presented her research findings and video on migrant domestic workers in our online parliamentary event chaired by labour MP Jess Phillips on Nov 17 2020. We have also used Joyce's policy report in our call to action in writing letters to MPs to support the reinstatement of rights of domestic workers. **Joyce's study has significantly improved parliamentarian awareness of the plight of migrant domestic workers in the UK, mobilised wide support and advanced our campaign on the Overseas Domestic Worker visa''** **\[10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Challenges in access to education, and the well\-publicized digital skills gap, call for innovative methods and supporting technology to promote education. Research at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\) has led to two innovations: WRS, a communication device to give rapid feedback to learners, and iDEA, a learning platform based on sound technology acceptance principles. Together, they have influenced changes in best practice for government and professional bodies, revolutionized professional standards and training, changed educational practice in primary, secondary and higher education, and encouraged continuing personal and professional development and lifelong learning. This impact has been felt by millions of users covering over 95% of the world’s countries, delivering worldwide impact in educational attainment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The success of individuals and the societies in which they live, depends on education. This is particularly true in the field of IT, where there is a well\-publicized digital skills gap. This is exacerbated by the fact that at Key Stage 4 only 4% of girls rank IT first in terms of an enjoyable subject, compared to 17% of boys. This has resulted in women being only 20% of the STEM workforce, even though, in the UK, digital skills are required for 82% of online job vacancies \[S1\]. 

 Digital skills gaps are often discussed in terms of a set of 21<sup>st</sup>\-Century skills that describe the knowledge, skills and behaviours required for success in today’s multi\-cultural society. A better link is required between 21<sup>st</sup> century skills development and employment needs, especially in Computer Science \[S2\] and, globally, millions lose out on learning because they cannot access formal education. 

 Mobile learning, whereby learners access the curriculum from their phone or tablet, can offer a potential solution to these challenges by mixing formal and informal teaching methods. However, the learning materials must be structured such that they provide the skills needed by industry, satisfy the requirements of exam boards and effectively engage students to learn and retain what they have learned. This requires learning tools that are multilingual and culturally sensitive. 

 In 2020, more than 1.3bn children globally had their education impacted by Covid\-19, due to school closures. A mature mobile learning infrastructure would have reduced this impact. Research at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\) has focused on identifying and testing ways to solve the challenges of developing such systems for mobile learning and increasing their adoption. 

 The research in this case study was performed by the Technology Acceptance and Mobile Learning \(TAML\) research group at UoH. It was led by Prof. Rupert Ward \(at UoH since 2005\), and Prof. Joan Lu \(at UoH since 2000\). TAML’s research is pitched at two levels: 

 **Work Surrounding the Underlying Mobile Learning Platform** 

 Professor Lu started her research over 15 years ago, creating a Wireless Response System \(WRS\) which provided rapid feedback to schoolroom pupils, communicating answers during lessons. WRS are affordable, efficient and accessible and can be adapted to diverse learning contexts. However, they suffered from performance and user acceptance issues and in 2015, Lu undertook research to improve the operational efficiency of wi\-fi using fast data streaming technology. The initial application was in smart homes \[R1\], where they demonstrated its use anytime and anywhere across multi\-session and multi\-user configurations. This was applied to speed up the data\-acquisition element of WRS. 

 To maximize access to mobile learning globally, language translation needed to be optimized. In 2016, the researchers in TAML investigated the key multilingual WRS access issues, which were found to be character sets, operating systems, user interfaces, formatting, and culturally appropriate content \[R2\].  The WRS was applied within English primary education \[R3\] \(2018\). Two schools in West Yorkshire, were provided with WRS technology \(small tablet computers\) and teachers were trained to use them. Feedback from heads, teachers and pupils was used to analyse the level of pupil interest, engagement and understanding. 

 **Work Surrounding the Technology Acceptance Model** 

 Professor Ward’s work on mobile learning adoption began in 2011, when he investigated how to make mobile learning easier for the student, making reflective learning tasks undertaken by university students more effective and engaging, as they built their personal development portfolios. He developed a mobile application \(app\) that organized student learning activities within an e\-portfolio and could be accessed at any time. 

 Ahmed and Ward \(2015\) explored a range of technology acceptance models, to identify ways that the app could be improved. The research highlighted that the current models were too generic and inadequate when applied to e\-learning. In 2016, their investigations focused on improving the adoption of e\-learning. A meta\-analysis of the existing technology acceptance models identified over 150 possible acceptance factors. From these, five key factors were synthesized and codified in the General Extended Technology Acceptance Model for E\-Learning \(GETAMEL\) \[R4\]. The factors were: self\-efficacy \(confidence\), subjective norm \(socially conforming\), enjoyment, computer anxiety and experience. The model was then tested with students using the e\-portfolio solution \[R5\]. 

 The individual factors in GETAMEL enabled mobile\-learning solutions to be customized so that technology acceptance barriers to learning were lowered and intention to use mobile\-learning solutions increased. An initial e\-portfolio test showed that the five factors identified in this model accounted for 58% of behavioural intention to use \[R5\]. The factors therefore have become key determinants of effectiveness and adoption online when there is a lack of direct human engagement. 

 Between 2015 and 2017, Ward was seconded to the Royal Household, where he applied the GETAMEL factors to the development of a mobile learning platform for a charitable foundation \(iDEA   [idea.org.uk/](https://idea.org.uk/)\). The platform hosted the learning materials needed to develop a 21<sup>st</sup> century skills e\-portfolio. Interactive digital badges \(validated indicators of accomplishment or skill\) and an associated awards structure were developed. iDEA was designed to promote confidence, social learning, enjoyment and experiential learning, and to reduce anxiety \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research findings in section 2 were translated into the two technologies: 

 \(i\) The Wireless Response System \(WRS\), developed by Professor Lu, is a mobile learning tool to measure learning behaviour and quantify understanding. It improves on the state of the art, in that it does not use specialist equipment \(it can use a wide range of existing devices\), it is multi\-lingual and multi\-discipline, and its online implementation uses a range of web services to ensure secure local or remote connection between tutor and learner. 

 \(ii\) Professor Ward led the iDEA.org.uk project, a digital skills portfolio learning portal whose design is based on the five GETAMEL factors \[R4\], with the objective of optimizing adoption and engagement through self\-directed mobile learning. Ward carried out most of the development during his Royal Household secondment \(2015–17\), creating an online environment where learners could gain digital badges and awards through bite\-sized personalized learning. The initial focus of iDEA, was to enable the development of skills necessary for employment, especially in the digital and computer science sectors. 

 To summarise the impact, these technologies have benefited educational institutions, learners \(Key Stage 2 to adult\), local and national governments, employers and employees, via practitioners, professional services delivery and performance enhancement. The detailed impacts are grouped under four headings: 

 **Encouraging Continuing Personal and Professional Development and Lifelong Learning** 

 The use of WRS \[R2\] has increased intercultural awareness through its 300,000 users worldwide, from more than 100 countries. It supports five languages \(Russian, Polish, Arabic, Chinese and English\) and six disciplines \(engineering, languages, law, maths, cyber\-security and database design\). The system means students are prepared to learn by making mistakes. A lecturer in Shanghai said: “The students can freely express their individual opinion because the system is designed anonymously \[..\] they do not worry in case they have made mistakes” \[S6\]. 

 iDEA has been widely adopted by the personal and professional development programmes for UK job centres, prisons, local councils, schools and universities. Since its launch in 2017, over 7 million iDEA digital badges have been completed in over 190 countries \[S7\]. Talking about the breadth of the iDEA user base, the Special Adviser to the City & Guilds Group stated: “in coordination with the Armed Forces, the Department for Work and Pensions \(DWP\) and Jobcentre Plus \(JCP\) Youth Obligation programme, iDEA training is \[enabling\] learners to move from the benefit system into employment, \[..\] with the job centre initiative alone providing free and highly accessible training for 1.6M learners across the UK”. He continued: “iDEA’s uptake has been phenomenal, with more than six million badges completed to date. This success, and iDEA’s impact more generally across the world, have been because it \[..\] is so fit for purpose” \[S7\]. The philosophy of iDEA is discussed in detail in a book by Ward, which has a foreword by the OECD’s Director for Education and Skills: “Learning systems need to better recognise that individuals learn differently, and in different ways at different stages of their lives. They need to create new ways of providing education that take learning to the learner and that are most conducive to students’ progress. Learning is not a place, but an activity. \[..\] Future learning systems need to use the potential of technologies to \[..\] connect learners in new and powerful ways, with sources of knowledge, with innovative applications and with one another” \[R6\]. 

 **Changing Educational Practice in Primary, Secondary and Higher Education** 

 Testing of the WRS \[R2\] demonstrated improved learning progress and subsequent academic achievement. The immediate feedback on student understanding provided by the WRS enabled teachers to monitor progress in real\-time and more easily analyse learning barriers, especially in bilingual contexts. Using the information, they adjusted what they taught and how they optimized the overall learning experience. For instance, in Wuhan, China, its use has improved student performance and maintained their employability during the 2020 pandemic. The Course Leader, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Wuhan Institute of Technology said: “The use of WRS improves student performance and the grade average of our courses. This year, despite the Covid\-19 period, through the use of the WRS system, students still maintain a high degree of enthusiasm for learning. Compared with previous years, we have performed well, and the employment rate of graduates still reached 85%. WRS has made a good contribution to our success and achievements” \[S8\]. 

 iDEA has improved education in UK primary and secondary schools, by influencing and enabling changes to the curriculum. It was used by Computing at Schools, a charity supported by the professional body for computing, known as BCS the Chartered Institute for IT, that works to improve the quality of computing education. iDEA has also enabled gender equality; the scheme Code: First Girls has supported 25,000 female coders since 2017. Internationally it was adopted by the Council of British International Schools, iamtheCODE \(an African\-led scheme to encourage marginalized girls to study STEM subjects\) and the British Council \(2017 onwards\) \[S9\]. A Programme Manager at iDEA wrote: “iDEA has changed learning. In formal education, it is used both to teach the curriculum in Key Stage 2 and 3, as well as to inspire and motivate digital skills development outside of the classroom.\[..\] iDEA’s overall audience is 52% female this year, reflecting its cross\-gender appeal and helping to break down gender barriers in the tech sector. Internationally, it is used in more than 95% of all countries”. Commenting on the unusual circumstances of 2020, she added: “at the start of the UK lockdown, more than 1M additional iDEA badges were completed in less than five weeks as schools transitioned rapidly to mobile learning” \[S9\]. 

 **Defining Best Practice for Government and Professional Bodies** 

 iDEA was cited as best practice by the UK Government in a DCMS report \(2016\), which stated: “Third sector organisations have particular roles to play at various levels: for example, support for digital skills development in young people is being provided through iDEA” \[S3\].  The Royal Society, in a 2017 report on Computing Education in UK Schools, commented: “iDEA is an innovative Badge Store concept that helps people develop skills for free \[..\] Badges have been mapped against the National Curriculum and the Skills Framework for the Information Age. This helps support teachers across a range of curriculum subjects including the three core areas of formal computing education: digital literacy, computer science and IT” \[S4\]. 

 The Greater Manchester \(GM\) Digital Strategy \(2018\) identified iDEA as a means of increasing digital inclusion. It decided to “Roll out the iDEA digital enterprise award across GM so that we have an easily accessible free way for any young person or adult across GM to develop digital skills for life and work”. \[S5\] This factor was underlined by the description of iDEA as “the digital and enterprise equivalent of the Duke of Edinburgh Award” by the Royal Society in 2017 \[S4\]. 

 **Revolutionizing Professional Standards and Training** 

 The application of iDEA within the Computing at Schools scheme and the Key Stage 3 National Curriculum in the UK, demonstrated how digital badging can underpin existing qualifications by providing a granular skills profile to an employer, rather than an opaque traditional qualification syllabus. The work was applied to higher education through the development of a 21<sup>st</sup> Century digital skills taxonomy and framework for the mini\-qualifications \(microcredentials\) that constitute a full, traditional qualification. The framework informed the review of the new BCS computing accreditation standard for universities. It was also used in developing a global microcredentialing standard for the cross\-professional body, International Council on Badges and Credentials \(ICoBC\). Its impact on the BCS standard is in increasing transparency within university degrees by better communicating digital skills acquisition to employers, lecturers and learners. It has also been adopted by Manchester Metropolitan University for their international computing degrees. Wider international adoption has increased skills transferability globally, making it easier to communicate capabilities across subjects, sectors and economies. This has enabled governments, the OECD and other inter\-governmental organizations to better analyse and address global digital skills gaps \[S10\]. The President of the BCS \(2017–2018\), stated: “Rupert’s research, \[..\] has highlighted to the BCS review group an additional important strand for consideration within its accreditation review. Rupert is representing the BCS in discussions with the ICoBC, in parallel with the accreditation review, to develop an international recognised standard through a digital skills taxonomy \(an agreed categorisation of skills\) and a microcredentialing framework \(a way of linking acquired skills to qualifications\) \[..\] Rupert’s work is significant input to the inclusion of informal learning, something which has profound implications for skills development both within the BCS and within other professional bodies” \[S10\]. Without the novelty demonstrated in identifying and testing the five factors in the GETAMEL model and applying these to iDEA.org.uk, the technology would not have been accepted, the intention to use would not have been as high as it has been, and the global ongoing reach and significance both in numbers and breadth would not have occurred.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 A University of Reading study has provided a rare account of the human costs of snakebite envenoming \(SBE\) in India, where approximately half of global SBE deaths occur. Dr Sakthi Vaiyapuri’s 2013 paper has been cited by the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) as the only evidence on the socio\-economic burden of SBE in India. This has supported policy development for global action to tackle SBE, including the 2019 publication of the WHO’s SBE strategy for prevention and control. Vaiyapuri’s finding that snakebite victims delay seeking treatment owing to lack of public awareness led him to develop and lead a public education campaign, which in 2019 reached an estimated 73,000,000 people via assemblies, leafleting, social media, television and newspaper articles. Consequently, two\-thirds of SBE patients admitted to a major referral hospital in 2019 said that they were aware of the campaign, 95% arrived for treatment in under four hours in 2019 \(compared with 60.5% in 2018\) and SBE patient outcomes were improved.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Estimating the global figures for disease, disability and deaths caused by SBE is problematic, primarily because SBE affects people living in poor, rural communities in which many do not have access to, or do not seek, appropriate healthcare. There is also a lack of systematic data collection. However, a 2017 study \(Gutiérrez *et al*.\) estimated that there are up to 138,000 deaths and 400,000 disabilities from SBE around the world each year. According to the World Health Organisation \(WHO\), this equates to a loss of 6\- to 8,000,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years \(DALYs\) – a toll comparable to prostate cancer, cervical cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and viral hepatitis. The Global Centre for Health Research Million Death Study estimated that approximately 58,000 deaths due to SBE occur annually in India, with states dominated by agricultural production, such as Tamil Nadu, the most heavily affected \(Suraweera *et al*. 2020\). The authors of the study concluded that global cases of SBE, including in India, are significantly underreported. 

 **Better estimates of SBE incidence and impacts on rural populations:** In 2010, Vaiyapuri and colleagues performed a household survey \(28,494 people\) within 30 geographically representative rural villages in Tamil Nadu. This study indicated that the average **annual incidence of SBE in Tamil Nadu was 2.4 times higher** than previously estimated and demonstrated that the incidence of SBE was greater in small villages \(with <100 houses\) compared to medium \(with 100 to 250 houses\) and large villages \(with >250 houses\) \[1\]. The finding suggests that official statistics have previously underestimated the true scale of the problem: up to 50% of cases go unreported in remote rural areas where access to medical facilities and transport is highly limited. Victims either seek alternative treatments from local healers or die on the way to hospital \[1\]. As part of the same study, the team performed detailed interviews with 105 snakebite victims \(or a family member\) to identify the immediate and long\-term socio\-economic ramifications of SBE on the rural population, based on SBE events between 2001 and 2010, as reported by study participants. Vaiyapuri and colleagues found evidence that **SBE has a multitude of consequences for the individuals affected and their families**: 

1.  In terms of financial consequences, **none of the 105 victims who paid for their treatment were covered by medical insurance**. The one\-off direct costs disclosed by participants in the 2010 study ranged between INR 1,000–INR 350,000, and long\-term costs were up to INR 400,000 \[1\]. According to the Indian labour bureau, the average daily wage in India for agricultural occupations in 2007 to 2008 was INR 76 for a man and INR 54 for a woman, thus even INR 1,000 \(approximately GBP 10\) represented around half a month’s salary and INR 350,000 represents over 12 years’ salary for a typical agricultural worker. 

1.  Impacts on the livelihoods of victims and their families were exacerbated by the **lack of loan availability from national banks to cover medical expenses**. Indeed, 17.8% of victims who paid for their treatment found it necessary to sell stored crops, 14% sold valuable items such as jewellery, 9.3% sold cattle, and 5.4% sold vehicles such as bicycles and motorcycles. Sadly, 3.1% found it necessary to remove their children from education and send them to work, and 3.9% had to sell land or property. **The significant threat to financial stability is likely to be the primary factor, in most cases, in whether individuals seek IMMEDIATE medical attention following a snakebite** \[1\]. 

1.  The study also identified a **high rate of long\-term health conditions induced by SBE** among the rural population of Tamil Nadu. Notably, current snake antivenoms are not effective when administered to patients who are already exhibiting extensive muscle damage or other advanced clinical signs of SBE around the bite site. The implication is, therefore, that **DELAYED hospital attendance is associated with increased morbidity, permanent disability and mortality** \[1\] **.** 

1.  The research also identified that **64% of victims received no first aid**. Of the remaining 36%, almost all first aid was provided by untrained individuals, often taking the form of dangerous measures such as cutting the bite site with non\-sterile sharp items and sucking blood, and practising ineffective, plant\-based traditional treatments. In addition to financial cost, the study has established that the **lack of public awareness is another important factor that influences treatment\-seeking behaviour** and thereby contributes to SBE\-induced deaths, disabilities and the long\-term socio\-economic impacts \[1\]. 

 **Addressing the clinical challenges to the diagnosis and treatment of SBE in rural populations:** In 2010, Vaiyapuri interviewed 25 clinicians working in rural clinics across Tamil Nadu to gauge their views on the challenges in treating and diagnosing snakebites. This study identified significant knowledge gaps and lack of training in standard protocols which presented challenges to the provision of appropriate primary treatment for SBE by healthcare professionals working in rural areas \[2\]. It is vital to address these gaps to enable rural healthcare workers to provide appropriate first aid and triage snakebite victims confidently, prior to sending patients to tertiary care facilities for further, more intensive treatment.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Vaiyapuri’s two\-pronged approach to preventing death and debilitation from SBE has shaped global policy on how to address SBE and, by engaging with rural communities who are most at risk, has raised public awareness of how to avoid snakebite and how to respond and seek rapid treatment if bitten, saving potentially thousands of lives. 

##  Contributing to the evidence behind global SBE policy 

 The World Health Organisation’s 2016 publication, *Guidelines for the management of snakebites* \[E1\], **cited Vaiyapuri **et al**. \(2013\) to highlight the long\-term health complications caused by SBE**. While acknowledging that the data on the global burden of snakebite were incomplete, the WHO formally recognised snakebite as a ‘high priority’ neglected tropical disease in 2017. The WHO Director General’s 2018 report *Global snakebite burden* \[E2\] **cited Vaiyapuri **et al**. \(2013\) again to demonstrate that the high costs of SBE treatment push poor people further into poverty and debt**. On the basis of this report, WHO’s Executive Board recommended that the 71<sup>st</sup> World Health Assembly \(WHA\) adopt resolution EB142.R4 on addressing the burden of SBE. Subsequently, with a mandate from WHA member states to direct and coordinate global action on SBE, WHO developed, and published, *Snakebite Envenoming: A strategy for prevention and control* \(2019\) \[E3\]. **Vaiyapuri **et al.** \(2013\) is the only evidence cited from India of both the significant short\-term treatment costs and long\-term socio\-economic costs of SBE in this strategy document**. This ambitious roadmap includes a GBP 120,000,000 programme to reduce snakebite\-induced deaths/disabilities by half in 2030. 

##  ‘Rapid action saves lives’ campaign targets rural populations in Tamil Nadu 

 The clear need for community education on SBE, as demonstrated by Vaiyapuri’s research, motivated Vaiyapuri to develop and lead a campaign to provide public health information to at\-risk communities across the state of Tamil Nadu \(an area the same size as England, but where approximately half of its 77,000,000 residents live in rural areas\). The primary aim of the campaign was to dispel myths around snakes and snakebites, to provide clear, simple advice on how to respond to snakebites and, ultimately, to positively influence the treatment\-seeking behaviour of victims and their relatives. 

 The team organised awareness assemblies in over 140 schools and colleges \(with between 200 to 400 attendees at each event\), and in over 100 rural villages \(with between 100 to 300 attendees at each event, see Figure 1\). These activities were supported by resources developed at the University of Reading including a comprehensive information leaflet \(in Tamil and English\), posters, and videos \[E4\]. The team also mounted a face\-to\-face leafleting campaign in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, supermarkets, and bus stations across the region. In total, these activities provided **direct engagement with approximately 200,000 people between January and December 2019**. The campaign team itself also expanded from a core of 15 to over 100 volunteer members across the state \(including healthcare professionals, charity workers, and education providers\) over the same period. 

 To supplement face\-to\-face activities, Vaiyapuri created a Facebook page for people to access campaign resources and to discuss the issues raised \[E4\]. **The Facebook page was** **viewed over 2,800,000 times between March and May 2019** after two adverts, containing short information videos, targeted to the rural population in Tamil Nadu were produced. Additional short information videos posted on the Facebook page received over 150,000 views between August 2019 and March 2020. In collaboration with the producer of a popular TV series *Pulan Visaranai* \(meaning ‘crime investigation’\), Vaiyapuri and other core team members co\-developed a 25\-minute documentary, titled ‘Deadly Snakes’, containing key messages from Vaiyapuri’s research and the campaign. This programme was broadcast on the *Puthiya Thalaimurai* news channel at peak viewing times and was estimated to have been **watched on television by more than 4,000,000 people over four screenings in April and May 2019** \[E5\] **,** with over 219,000 additional views of the documentary via social media over the same period. Furthermore, *Update News 360*, an online news channel developed a five\-minute video based on the campaign’s key messages, which was viewed over 330,000 times within one week of being uploaded to the channel’s Facebook page, with over 7,000 shares. In addition, more than 60 articles highlighting the campaign appeared in local, state\-wide and national newspapers between December 2018 and January 2020. These included **18** **articles in prominent newspapers \(Times of India, The Hindu, Dinamalar, Dina Thanthi and Dinakaran\) that reached a combined readership of 65,600,000,** according to average issue readership figures from the Indian Readership Survey, Q2 2019 \[E6, E7\]. 


 *Figure 1: Map showing the distribution of campaign activities across the state of Tamil Nadu*. 


##  Evaluating the success of the campaign 

###  Uptake and recall of key messages 

 Before their public awareness campaign, the team established that nearly 90% of students \(n=2,004\) believed that seeking prompt medical treatment was unnecessary, and 60% believed that traditional treatments were the best approach to treat snakebites. Similarly, only 10% of villagers surveyed prior to engagement \(n=2,418\) said that they would seek immediate medical attention and 95% believed that a tight tourniquet was the best approach to prevent venom from spreading following a bite. By contrast, when the survey was repeated at the end of engagement activities, **over 90% of student attendees and 95% of members of the wider community demonstrated good recall of the key messages: not to apply a tight tourniquet, not to cut and bleed or suck the bite site, not to waste time on traditional remedies, and to get to a hospital as quickly as possible**. Furthermore, the team returned to selected schools and villages after a period of 12 months to repeat the survey, which showed that over 90% of students \(n=303\) and 85% of villagers \(n=413\) remembered the information provided \[E8\]. 

 Over 250 participants including general physicians, clinicians, nurses, surgeons and other healthcare professionals from Tamil Nadu attended a one\-day symposium in December 2019, which was organised by the core team to address the clinical challenges in handling SBE patients \(surgical procedures to treat SBE\-induced muscle damage, complications associated with non\-venomous snakebites, and novel strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of SBE\). 95% of participants said that the knowledge that they gained would improve the ways in which they handle snakebite victims and had changed their views about SBE. Further written feedback indicated demand for hands\-on training. As a result, in September 2020, Vaiyapuri and colleagues ran an online survey, which has provided clarity on the training needs of rural clinicians. They have also instigated a collaboration with Health Action International as well as a former advisor on snakebites to the Tamil Nadu government, now principal of Trichy SRM Medical College in Tamil Nadu, with the aim of developing training materials for clinicians, e.g. on appropriate first aid measures for SBE. 

###  Changes in treatment\-seeking behaviour 

 TCR Multispeciality Hospital is a leading SBE referral centre in the north of Tamil Nadu, with patients from the surrounding six districts of Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Salem, Tirupathur, Thiruvannamalai and Vellore able to reach the hospital within two to three hours. Therefore, between 1 and 20 January 2019, all community education activities were focussed within these districts to enable the team to record the treatment\-seeking behaviour of the hospital’s SBE patients over 2019 \(see Figure 1\). Following informed consent, data was collected from 291 patients who were admitted to TCR with suspected snakebites between 20 January and 31 December 2019. This was compared with SBE admissions records from 2018 \(n= 223\). **Significant differences were observed in arrival times at the hospital between the 2018 and 2019 data** with 276 \(95%\) arriving in under four hours in 2019, compared to the corresponding figure of 135 \(60.5%\) in 2018. Remarkably, 283 \(97.3%\) of SBE patients arrived at TCR in 2019 without seeking traditional treatment, in contrast to 142 \(63.7%\) in 2018. These data are further supported by the observation that 173 **\(59.5%\) of SBE patients admitted to TCR in 2019 reported that they were aware of Vaiyapuri’s campaign, all of whom arrived at TCR within four hours of receiving a bite** \[E8\]. Furthermore, all SBE patients who were admitted to TCR in 2019 within four hours of being bitten were discharged within seven days \(45% of these within three days\). By comparison, all SBE patients who arrived at TCR in 2019 more than four hours after being bitten had hospital stays of over one week, and 47% stayed over one month due to the severity of their injuries. 

 **Summary:** Vaiyapuri’s studies have addressed a significant knowledge gap on the socio\-economic burden of SBE in India. This evidence was cited by the WHO as they developed a mandate for global action to tackle SBE. The multi\-faceted community education programme developed by Vaiyapuri and his team tackled some of the barriers to treatment seeking behaviour identified by his research. Through direct engagement and social media, the team reached approximately 8% of the total rural population of the state of Tamil Nadu in 2019 and, over the same time period, this reach was extended significantly through broadcast and newspaper coverage \(approximately 70m total views\). As a result, a greater proportion of people who had been bitten by snakes arrived at hospital faster compared to the previous year. This was endorsed by Health Action International, whose project manager for snakebites said: “Dr Vaiyapuri’s public education campaign has demonstrated the effectiveness of using targeted education tools to engage target communities resulting in a positive change in behaviours for snakebite treatment and care,” \[E9\]. Consequently, a greater number of patients were discharged sooner, with fewer complications and lower treatment costs, leading to better long\-term outcomes for families living in poverty.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Oral health treatment costs NHS England approximately £3.4 billion per year \(of which 9.1% is urgent care\) and yet 39% of the UK population does not attend a dentist. To improve oral health in this disengaged population, researchers at Sunderland developed an intervention that can be delivered by pharmacists. This intervention has significantly improved knowledge and practice in over 1,000 people; is one of the required criteria for all 109 Healthy Living Pharmacies in County Durham; and is incorporated into Health Education England North East’s CPD provision and Sunderland’s MPharm programme, with over 300 pharmacy staff and 300 trainee pharmacists already trained. The research has given approximately 529,000 people free and simple access to oral health guidance. The success of this project provides critical evidence of the benefits of interprofessional collaboration in healthcare. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 When oral health is a significant problem and over a third of the population does not attend a dentist, there is an opportunity to explore whether this can be addressed by delivering oral health interventions in places that they do attend. Andrew Sturrock and colleagues at the University of Sunderland conducted research that investigates role that pharmacists could play in addressing the lack of advice and resulting oral health problems. 

  

 Sturrock \(in collaboration with the Durham County Council Public Health Team, County Durham and Darlington Local Pharmaceutical Committee, and County Durham and Darlington Foundation Trust\) designed and trialled a pharmacy\-based oral health intervention **\[R1\]**. Its main purpose was to establish whether community pharmacies could play a role in tackling the problem of oral health, an issue compounded by disengagement from dental services. This research found that pharmacists were able to reach patients with a poor history of accessing dental services and produce positive intentions to change oral hygiene behaviours in a large number of patients. 

 A team from Sunderland \(in collaboration with the National University of Singapore\) then utilised interpretive qualitative methods to interview a wide range of primary care health professionals \(pharmacists, doctors, nurses, practice managers\) and patients. This study provided evidence of a lack of integration between oral and general healthcare services and the isolation of dental teams from other professional groups, both of which potentially impact negatively on patient care. It also identified an opportunity to improve oral and general healthcare through the developing role of clinical pharmacists working in general practice **\[R2\].** 

 The same group adopted a grounded theory approach to interview pharmacists and doctors **\[R3\]** and dentists **\[R4\]**. This study explored the interprofessional prevention of medication\-related osteonecrosis of the jaw \(MRONJ\), a rare yet significant adverse effect of some prescribed medications. This research identified that patient safety continues to be compromised due to limited awareness of the condition and preventive interventions and lack of integration between oral and general health services. 

 They then adopted a grounded theory approach to interview a wide range of patients, including those with a diagnosis of MRONJ **\[R5\].** This study highlighted the significant detrimental impact that MRONJ can have on a patient’s quality of life, despite poor awareness of the condition amongst those who prescribed implicated medications. This provided evidence to support the recommendations in guidelines published by the Scottish Dental Clincal Effectiveness Programme for the prioritisation of preventive measures and closer interprofessional working. A key finding related to the barriers for patients accessing dental services, with the pharmacist providing significant opportunities for reinforcement of information and the provision of advice to patients on the adverse effects of newly prescribed medications. 

 This research has led to an NIHR ARC grant of £48,155 awarded to Sturrock to explore the role of community pharmacists in delivering opportunistic head and neck cancer screening for at\-risk patients.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research underpinned the creation, piloting and evaluation of a **pharmacy\-based oral health intervention** and an **educational intervention** to support the development of pharmacists’ roles in the interprofessional management and integration of oral and general health. The health intervention, piloted in late 2016, was offered to adults in receipt of free prescriptions, and consisted of a short demonstration of how teeth should be cleaned, after which patients received supporting information and advice from the Oral Health Foundation, details of local dental providers, and a bag containing a toothbrush, toothpaste and an information leaflet. Five Healthy Living Pharmacies \(HLPs\) in deprived County Durham communities took part in the pilot. Each pharmacy was asked to deliver the intervention to at least 200 patients; in total, 1,069 patients participated. 

 The focus of the impact is on the North East because poor oral health is particularly acute in the region; in Sunderland 28.4% of the population have at least one incidence of decay, tooth loss or filling, and in Middlesbrough this rises to 32.1% \(national average: 23.3%\) **\[S1\]**. It has since been extended into other areas. 

 <ins> **Impact on patients**</ins> 

 Evaluation of the pilot indicated a clear improvement in patient knowledge and intended behaviour, with **72% of the 1,069 patients who took part saying that their knowledge about oral health was now “much better”**. One pharmacist reported that “ *a lot of people \[…\] actually didn’t know how to do their teeth*,” and another said that “ *people who thought because they had no teeth anymore, they didn’t have to go back to the dentist*.” In addition, **66% said they would definitely change the way they look after their teeth**. The majority \(64%\) of patients also agreed that the pharmacy is the right place to receive advice about their teeth **\[S2\]**. Crucially, the intervention reached patients who stand to benefit most; all patients were from deprived communities where at least one incidence of decay, tooth loss or filling \(d<sub>3</sub>mft > 0\) exceeds the national average. Given the relationship between poor oral health and long\-term conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, the population of patients intending to change how they care for their teeth can be expected to show an associated improvement in general health. 

 Behind these statistics lies a more fundamental change: **patients have had a positive experience with oral healthcare**. The intervention, using short and spontaneous conversations about how to care for their teeth, reengaged patients in oral healthcare and **improves patient trust in healthcare professionals** – important for managing dental anxiety, a major barrier to using dental services. Promisingly, **73% of patients said they wanted details of local dental practices**, information that was provided by the pharmacy team. 

 <ins> **Impact on</ins> <ins>practice</ins><ins>**</ins> 

 Staff at the participating HLPs completed training to enable them to provide the recommended advice specified by Public Health England in the *Delivering better oral health* toolkit. Qualitative interviews with these staff showed **that their knowledge had improved** after receiving the training; for example, “ *One of the things I didn’t realise until I came back was the amount of toothpastes on the market that don’t actually have any fluoride in*” **\[S2\]**. Other staff have identified how **the training augments their professional practice**, saying that it helped them to consider how medications may be related to oral health problems, and that they would keep sugar\-free medication in mind **\[S3\]**. 

 The pilot’s success confirmed that the concept could be replicated more widely. **Health Education England covering North East and North Cumbria \(HEENE\) now offer pharmacy team training in oral health as accredited CPD** as continuing support following the pilot. **Since 2018 346 pharmacy staff from** North Tyneside, Newcastle, Northumberland, South of Tyne, Teesside, County Durham and Carlisle **have completed it**. HEENE’s Clinical Lead says “ *Pharmacy curricula do not typically incorporate oral health training, and this in\-service training addresses that gap*” **\[S4\]**. In response, since 2018/19 the University of Sunderland has integrated this training into its MPharm programme. Through this route **, approximately 300 training pharmacists have benefited from this enhanced capacity**. Alongside face\-to\-face training, since 2019 HEENE has delivered oral health training as e\-learning modules as well as face to face events to include specialists topic, for example oral cancer **\[S4\]**. The unit’s research thus contributes to the development of both the existing and future workforce. 

 <ins> **Impact on health policy**</ins> 

 The success of the pilot **resulted in a change in health policy at Durham County Council**. In 2018\-19 oral health became a local target for all 109 HLPs in the county, meaning that pharmacies must actively support their patients’ oral health to maintain their HLP status **\[S5\]**. Patients do not need to attend the dentist for guidance about oral health, but can access it in a setting they already visit, at a time convenient to them, for free. Since there is one pharmacy for every 4,850 people in England, **staff in these pharmacies can prompt as many as 529,000 patients to follow signposting to dental services** and take action to prevent the occurrence or worsening of oral health problems, thus also protecting their general health. The British Dental Journal’s editor agrees, saying that the intervention “ *highlights how interdisciplinary collaboration can be of great potential benefit to society in general and dental patients, actual and potential, in particular*” **\[S6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Neary and Winn at the University of Lincoln has changed thinking in the UK and internationally around how higher education is provided. Their work has influenced students, educationalists, policy makers and politicians to think about alternative models within contemporary Higher Education. 

 Their work on Student as Producer influenced the agenda in HE for students to be ‘partners’ and their research on co\-operative higher education has been a major influence on the establishment of a co\-operative university. It was adopted as Co\-operative Party policy \(2017\) and enacted in proposals for the UK’s first co\-operative university submitted to the Office for Students in 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Neary and Winn's research emerged out of concerns among academics and students about the increasing marketisation and commercialisation of higher education since the 1980s. Contrary to the government's neo\-liberal policies for higher education, exemplified by the intention to create students as consumers, Neary and Winn developed the notion of students as producers of higher education as the basis for a counter\-hegemonic discourse to resist government policy \(Neary and Winn, 2009 **\[3.1\]**\). The power of this intervention and the reason for its impact was that it operated in full view *inside* a neo\-liberal university. 

 Student as Producer became the organising principle for teaching and learning at the University of Lincoln from 2010, supported by funding from the Higher Education Academy \(HEA\). Student as Producer works as a model of curriculum development and as strategy for institutional transformation. It does this by recognizing the contribution undergraduates make to the production of research and teaching in HE institutions. It seeks to consolidate and reward that contribution through the promotion of greater student engagement in university life through core elements such as research\-engaged teaching and curricula and the inclusion of students in the running of the university. 

 This programme of change led Neary and Winn to research how higher education could be further reconfigured, moving beyond students’ active engagement in teaching and research, to students being constitutionally recognised stakeholders in the democratic ownership, governance and management of a university. The development of their work, from Student as Producer to Co\-operative Higher Education, has been documented through five stages of research and a number of key publications: 

1.  The research began by setting out a critical response to the commercialisation of higher education, exploring the purpose of higher education and examining the notion of student as consumer \(Neary and Winn, 2009\) **\[3.1\]**. The tension between Student as Producer and student engagement, leading to the reform of Student as Producer’s original radicalism within a neo\-liberal university was discussed by Neary and Saunders \(2016\) **\[3.2\].** 

1.  While working inside the University of Lincoln on Student as Producer, Neary and Winn established the Social Science Centre, Lincoln, a co\-operative for higher education outside mainstream university structures, which ran between 2011\-2018 \( [<ins>https://socialsciencecentre.org.uk</ins>](https://socialsciencecentre.org.uk/)\). This experimental work helped define and theorise the ‘co\-operative university’, making a key conceptual contribution to later work on the creation of a co\-operative university \(Winn, 2015\) **\[3.3\]**. It also inspired other groups to establish similar co\-operatives for higher education as outlined below. 

1.  Having established the idea of co\-operative higher education in the UK, Neary and Winn began to develop a framework based on the needs and desires of participants in the co\-operative movement and higher education sector. That action research, funded by the Independent Social Research Foundation \(ISRF\), focused on issues of ownership and control over the means of knowledge production \(Neary and Winn, 2017a\) **\[3.4\]**. The resulting conceptual and practical framework for co\-operative higher education \(Neary and Winn, 2017b\) **\[3.5\]** established the principles around which such a co\-operative university might be constructed: knowledge, democracy, livelihood, bureaucracy and solidarity. These principles were later taken up by the Co\-operative College in its work to create a co\-operative university \(Neary and Winn, 2019\) **\[3.6\].** 

1.  The principles were then explored in further research \(Neary, Valenzuela\-Fuentes and Winn, 2018\) **\[3.7\]** through a series of four case studies in already well\-established co\-operative enterprises. This research, funded by the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education \(LFHE\), highlighted the contradictory nature of capitalist work, and that working through these contradictions within co\-operatives might be a way to radically transform a consumer based higher education system. 

 e. A decade of work on Student as Producer and co\-operative higher education was discussed in a commissioned chapter in a book to mark the centenary of the Co\-operative College, Manchester \(Neary and Winn, 2019\) **\[3.6\].** Preparation of the chapter involved archival research that revealed how a ‘co\-operative university’ has been mooted for over 100 years. They also argue that, based on their findings, the political, legal and institutional conditions for a co\-operative university are now at their most favourable. It concludes by discussing how the Co\-operative College is taking steps to establish a co\-operative university in the UK, employing the framework Neary and Winn have created.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Neary and Winn’s research has influenced mainstream and contemporary UK HE sectors and encouraged new and existing institutions to change the way higher education is delivered, run and managed. Their work, and its focus on placing students at the centre of core functions such as research and governance, has in turn resulted in changes to Co\-operative Party policy **\[5.1\]** 

 and lead to the imminent creation of the UK’s first co\-operative university. 

 **Student as Producer** 

 Student as Producer was fundamental in establishing the concept of research\-engaged teaching across the UK HE sectors as well as the notion of student engagement and partnership \(Levy, 2015\). It has been adopted by institutions in the UK and internationally: the University of Warwick, Newcastle College, Hull College; University College Galway in the Irish Republic, Vanderbilt University in the USA, the University of British Columbia, Canada. **\[5.2\]** It remains the organising principle for all teaching and learning at the University of Lincoln. It involves the redesign of curricula, teaching and assessment to encourage and support greater student participation in the research culture and decision\-making of the university. 

 **Enabling alternative and experimental providers** 

 The principles of Student as Producer have been applied outside of the mainstream university setting. Between 2011\-2018, Neary and Winn were founding members of the Social Science Centre, Lincoln, a co\-operative for higher education. The co\-operative values and principles give institutional form to the pedagogical principles of Student as Producer and have inspired further efforts to establish co\-operatives for higher education: Leicester Vaughan College \(est. 2016\) \[ **5.3\]**; The Co\-operative Institute for Transnational Studies \(est. 2015, Greece/Mexico\); the Feral Art School \(est. 2018, Hull\), and Social Science Centre, Manchester \(est. 2016\). The emergence of these co\-operatives and increasing momentum surrounding Neary and Winn’s work led to the Co\-operative College, Manchester committing to create a co\-operative university in the UK in its centenary year. 

 **An “historic” moment** 

 A round table discussion was hosted by the Co\-operative College in January 2017, to discuss the possibility of establishing a co\-operative university in the UK. Research carried out by Neary and Winn on co\-operative higher education was a substantive agenda item and helped frame subsequent thinking. The meeting was attended by academic, student and co\-operative representatives, and recognised as an “historic” moment by the Trustees of the College. There was unanimous support at the meeting to create a co\-operative university in the UK. Neary was tasked with drafting a proposal for the Trustees to establish a Co\-operative University Working Group. 

 **A commitment by the Co\-operative College** 

 Following agreement by the College’s Trustees in April 2017, a Co\-operative University Working Group \(CUWG\) was established. Members of the group consisted of students and academics connected to the Co\-operative College or other co\-operative education initiatives. In October 2017, representatives from the CUWG, including Neary, presented their report to the Co\-operative College’s Board of Trustees, who accepted their recommendations to explore the feasibility of a federated co\-operative university. **\[5.4\]** An additional outcome from the CUWG was a national conference on ‘Making the Co\-operative University’. **\[5.5\]** 

 **Making the Co\-operative University** 

 Making the Co\-operative University was a conference hosted by the Co\-operative College in November 2017 and attended by over 90 delegates. The Agenda for the conference was based around themes from Neary and Winn’s research \(2017b\): Democracy, Members and Governance; Knowledge, Curriculum and Pedagogy; Livelihood and Finances; Bureaucracy and Accreditation. Outcomes from the conference fed into the College’s application for Degree Awarding Powers. 

 **Degree Awarding Powers** 

 In December 2017, representatives from the CUWG, including Neary, met with HEFCE to discuss the Co\-operative College’s intention to establish a co\-operative university. HEFCE were supportive of the initiative and advised the working group to discuss matters with the QAA, which they did in January 2018. The outcome of the meeting was an initial application in August 2018 to the Office for Students \(OfS\) for Degree Awarding Powers. 

 *“In practical terms, Neary and Winn’s contributions to the College’s annual conferences and their lead on the roundtable stakeholder discussions convened in 2017, was formative in bringing some of the College’s Trustees ‘on board’. Three themes developed in their research: governance, pedagogy and finance, have shaped our thinking around the essential issues and out of that came a confidence to move forward with the plans for a co\-operative university. This engagement has resulted in the College applying for new Degree Awarding Powers in April 2020” **\[5.6\]** 

 **New College Structures** 

 Following his retirement from the University of Lincoln in 2019, Neary was appointed as Chair of the Interim Academic Board at the Co\-operative College, tasked with obtaining Degree Awarding Powers and the creation of a federated co\-operative university. This work has been supported by an initial £200,000 investment by the College to recruit project staff. **\[5.6\]** In March 2020, a full application was lodged with the OfS, and they are awaiting the outcome of their application. **\[5.7\]** At their 2019 conference, the Labour Party pledged to support the establishment of more co\-operative universities as part of their National Education Service. **\[5.8\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Set against the background of austerity following the 2007/8 financial crisis, Richard Carr’s work on commercialisation in local government and the role of Local Enterprise Partnerships \(LEPs\) in business regeneration has led to significant changes in policy to address the financial challenges faced by English councils. This work has directly resulted in the generation of significant income from commercialisation to keep council services open, and new staff training and development to achieve wider cultural change. Further benefits from these impacts include plans for the regeneration of a town centre and saving many jobs through the continued staffing of council services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2010, English local government has faced a perfect storm. The combination of austerity – in the form of falling central government grant – and rising demand, in particular from ageing local populations, has brought to the fore questions about the long\-term viability of the services councils provide. Given this context, councils have been eager to seek out a range of new activities to generate revenue and make savings. 

 Carr’s distinctive contribution has been to expand on themes in his archive\-driven historical research \(the balance between central and local government, the impacts of austerity, and the creative use of new financial mechanisms\), to identify specific ways that local councils and other regional bodies can navigate the recent economic difficulties. These policy suggestions include forming new trading companies \(arms’ length businesses owned by a council but operationally independent\), joint ventures \(i.e. jointly owned projects with private or third sector sources\), and selling current in\-house provision to other parts of the public or private sectors. 

 His academic research, disseminated in a range of outputs, has underpinned his work with the local government focussed think tank Localis – an organisation based in Westminster which publishes reports whose main audience is local and national politicians, and policy focussed journalists. His work with Localis has drawn on interviews and surveys of current local government stakeholders, and the use of central departmental statistics – to make contemporary policy recommendations. 

 Carr’s research has a strong historical underpinning. It has used standard tools of historical analysis \(archival research, primary and secondary literature\) to identify a long\-term trend – economic depression causing central government austerity, in turn creating problems for local government – and has sought to utilise contemporary tools to address this issue in the present. 

 To give a sense of the historical background, in his 2014 book *One Nation Britain* \(ref 1\) Carr took politicians’ arguments for greater powers for English local government from the 1930s to the 1950s, and demonstrated \(e.g. p.10, pp.152\-3\) their relevance to Britain in a new ‘age of austerity’. This included discussing local authority trading powers, and contextualised those historical figures, like Tony Crosland and Harold Macmillan, who had made the case for extending these powers. 

 Elsewhere, Carr’s research has revealed both the adverse consequences of rapid budget cuts, and the related consequences of reduced economic growth. As such, Carr’s academic work \(ref 2\) has set out the damaging impacts of central government austerity in the interwar era, including its potentially negative effects on the contemporary public health picture, and the knock\-on effects for English local government in the 1930s. Equally, in 2017, Carr’s ‘Responsible Capitalism’ \(ref 3\) drew on the experience of a shrinking and passive state in the 1980s, and explored the idea of a National Investment Bank to spread growth across the regions. Both aforementioned articles included comparisons with more recent policy. 

 Carr’s underpinning research has therefore led to two key impact strands: 

1.  the increased use of commercial activities by English local authorities to manage their immediate financial position and deliver/improve services 

1.  the handing down of powers and funds from Whitehall to councils and other arms’ length bodies which can deliver long term, strategic investment. 

 Having made the case for the above in his academic outputs, to achieve impact for key impact 1, Carr authored a report for the think tank Localis: *Commercial Councils* \(ref 4\). This called for ‘Councils and appropriate professional bodies \[to\] increase the focus on commercial and financial skills as part of officers’ professional development.’ It further argued for councils to seek to establish trading companies to generate revenue in areas from legal services to waste management and housing. 

 As to handing down of powers and funds from Whitehall to councils and other arms’ length bodies, *One Nation Britain* \(chapter 6\) and Carr’s ‘Responsible Capitalism’ article \(passim\) further outlined the historic balance between central government, local economies outside London, and the former’s willingness to hand power to non\-Whitehall institutions to drive investment. This research was again disseminated in a policy focussed manner through another report Carr authored for Localis, *The Next LEPs* \(2015\) \(ref 5\). This argued for greater devolution of budgets to Local Enterprise Partnerships – 38 sub\-regional bodies set up by the 2010\-15 Coalition government to coordinate local growth, which involve participation from council and private sector leaders \- but also made the case for greater diversity amongst LEP board members and increased public accountability.

","
### 1.  Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The two reports Carr authored for Localis \- *Commercial Councils* \(2015\) and *The Next LEPs* \(2015\) \- have proved influential in: changing attitudes and perspectives in local government towards commercialisation; the development of training for public sector staff; increasing commercialism in local authorities; and the push for greater diversity amongst LEP leadership. They were grounded in interviews and surveys with local government figures, and thereby used quantitative and qualitative data regarding the current economic situation to provide recommendations for future decision making. Welcomed by politicians from then Shadow Secretary Business Secretary Chuka Umunna to Mayor of Birmingham and the West Midlands Andy Street, they were disseminated through physical launch events in central London, and through freely available downloads of the reports themselves on the Localis website. 

 Since publication, English local councils have implemented strategies recommended in the reports, creating growth in commercial income and/or producing savings \- enabling them to continue to run public services and avoid cuts. In the case of the more than GBP1,000,000\+ savings generated for Hounslow **\(S1\)**, this equates to underpinning the median salary of 33 employees at the council. \( **S1**\). All told, the impact of Carr’s work falls under four strands. 

###  1. Influencing local council strategies and creating financial benefit 

 At least 19 local authorities \(5% of the total number of English authorities\) have cited Carr’s findings from his *Commercial Councils* report in public\-facing documents justifying and influencing their moves towards more entrepreneurial, medium\-term financial strategies. These councils include: West Berkshire, NE Derbyshire, Lancashire, Medway, Lewisham, Harrow, Merton, Sutton, Flintshire, Charnwood, Northumberland, Halton, Warrington, Hounslow, and West Lindsey **\(S2\)**. 

 The report’s emphasis on the creation of trading companies \(arms’ length businesses owned by a council but operationally independent\), has struck a real chord. Hounslow’s Executive Director of Finance & Corporate Resources noted the report was ‘influential in our commercial strategies, and ... is a document that Elected Members in particular refer back to when the council reflect on trading company performance and consider options for future strategy and growth.’ Referring to the creation of Hounslow’s trading company, their Executive Director of Finance notes that *Commercial Councils* ‘has proven a very useful tool for defending the existence of Lampton360 \(a local authority owned trading company\), and its revenues now allow the council to underpin more jobs through the umbrella of the Council family’ **\(S1\)**. In June 2019 the Managing Director of Lampton360 noted that the company has ‘saved \[Hounslow council\] in excess of GBP1,000,000 p.a. on a new service contract over the first 14 months of operation’ **\(S1\)**. Hounslow’s Executive Director goes on to state that ‘ *Commercial Councils* has helped change minds and, in concrete terms, allowed the council to offset...a tight financial picture.’ It has been ‘a key influence on a strategy that is generating new money that the council can use to reinvest \[in\] services’ **\(S1\)**. 

 Hounslow is no fluke. Citing Carr’s research as ‘align\[ing\]’ with their desire to ‘identify new opportunities for generating income, Lewisham allocated GBP200,000 to ‘fund strategic procurement and commercial services work’ **\(S3\).** Cambridgeshire County Council drew on it in devising their Commercialisation Strategy, while a member of East Hertfordshire Council noted that *Commercial Councils* influences his ‘approach as...a member of some relevant committees and groups seeking to increase the entrepreneurial ethos and techniques towards commercial generation of revenue’ **\(S3\).** 

 Most significant is the influence of Carr’s report on Merton Council’s decision to embark on a commercial joint venture. In 2016 Merton Council noted the need to overturn a GBP2,700,000 deficit and change its approach to become more commercial **\(S4\).** Citing Carr’s report, it argued for a change in culture, and advocated the establishment of joint ventures. It proposed as an example, a joint venture for the development of Morden Town Centre because the council, citing Carr’s report noted it would ‘receive maximum return’ from such an approach. In January 2018 the Council formally resolved to take such a step alongside Transport for London: the ten\-year scheme which was approved has an anticipated Development Value of approximately GBP1,000,000,000 **\(S4\)**. 

###  2. Impact on key bodies in the sector 

 Key bodies such as the Chartered Institute of Public Finances and Accountancy \(CIPFA\) have been influenced by Carr’s work **\(S5\)**. CIPFA has cited *Commercial Councils* in presentations and articles to councils in the promotion of a commercial approach. The Managing Director of CIPFA’s Advisory Service subsidiary C.co, cited Carr’s report extensively when discussing the need for a commercial approach in the public sector, while CIPFA’s Policy Manager for Local Government, states that ‘local authorities are taking seriously the skills needed to develop commercially, and staff are now being trained to support this agenda’ **\(S5\)**. The Association for Public Sector Excellence \(APSE\) drew on Carr’s report when discussing the management of commercial risk by councils, and the Information Commissioner’s Office have also cited Carr’s work in a 2019 Report to Parliament when making the case for making changes to access to information **\(S6\)**. 

###  3.Training and development 

 Carr’s report identifies a need for cultural change amongst councils and for training and development, as a necessary corollary for the necessary commercialisation. Sutton Council refers to Carr’s report in promoting entrepreneurialism amongst its staff **\(S7\)**. Likewise, Lewisham Council notes the need for support and training to ‘develop a widespread commercial culture at the Council’, as recommended in *Commercial Councils* **\(S3\),** a call responded to by a training programme for council members. Merton cited the report as evidence that ‘officers must be willing to expand their traditional way of doing things \[and\] not regard profit making as a role purely for the private sector’ **\(S4\).** 

###  4. Reforms to LEPs’ purpose and leadership 

 Carr’s report on LEPs has also been influential. Widely cited in the media from the *Financial Times* to *The Municipal Journal*, *The Next LEPs* conclusions on aligning local labour markets’ supply and demand has led to take\-up from The Association of Colleges in its lobbying materials **\(S8\)**. The Royal Town Planning Institute has further claimed that ‘accountability…continues to be central to debates on the on\-going developments of LEPs’ based on findings from Carr’s research **\(S9\)**. 

 Central government policy has also been influenced. Carr’s report highlighted the lack of diversity in the composition of LEPs’ boards, a point included in the 2018 Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government report ‘Strengthened Local Enterprise Partnerships’ which follows Carr’s recommendation of requiring greater public accountability of the LEPs and their actions **\(S10\)**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Hines project had positive social, cultural, educational, creative, and heritage impact. It increased awareness and appreciation of an overlooked working\-class writer, recovering forgotten works, facilitating their republication by a publisher with national and international distribution networks, and enhancing access to seldom\-viewed regional films. It introduced collaborative research practices into schools, contributing to teachers’ professional development and raising young people’s aspirations and engagement by unlocking creativity and developing research skills. It facilitated new cultural artefacts, generating new ways of representing the north and informing artists’ continuing practice, and enriched the Hines archive through the co\-production and deposit of new material. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research illuminates the significance of the novelist, dramatist, and screenwriter Barry Hines \(1939\-2016\), whose work includes the novel *A Kestrel for a Knave* \(1968\), filmed as *Kes* \(1969\), and the TV drama *Threads* \(1984\). 

 In 2008, Vice – then working on Hines’ near\-contemporary and fellow screenwriter Jack Rosenthal – was shown Hines’ papers, stored in boxes in his attic. Recognising their value, she negotiated their donation to Special Collections, University of Sheffield. This ensured the preservation of, and wider access to, this unique archive, which includes Hines’ correspondence, research materials, and scripts of otherwise ‘lost’ plays: ones which were either never performed, or recordings of which were subsequently destroyed. As such, the archive offers unparalleled insight into Hines’ practice as a writer and collaborator, and provides an eye\-witness perspective on the socio\-political culture of the North of England during a time of de\-industrialisation. The research subsequently conducted by Vice and Forrest – currently comprising the first book\-length study of Hines’ work \(R1\), one article \(R2\), and four essays \(R3\-6\) – is based on this archive. Key findings include: 

1.  Hines was a meticulous nature writer, and was much more involved in establishing the visual elements of his screenwork than has previously been understood, particularly in relation to the depiction of landscape and urban architecture. This reinstates Hines as a crucial creative presence in the filming of his work; it also challenges the critically dominant idea of auteurism, whereby a filmmaker controls all elements of production, resulting in a recognisable directorial style. Hines’ working relationships with directors and producers such as Ken Loach and Tony Garnett were symbiotic rather than hierarchical. Acknowledging this restores the often overlooked position of screenwriters, particularly working\-class screenwriters \(like Hines\), within film authorship. 

1.  Recovering Hines’ ‘lost’ works – such as *Billy’s Last Stand* \(1965\), the tapes of which were destroyed by the BBC – shows that he was much more experimental than his frequent association with ‘kitchen sink realism’ suggests. Initially produced as a radio play for the BBC, it was subsequently performed at London’s Royal Court Upstairs \(a space renowned for ambitious, cutting\-edge theatre\). Paying attention to the full breadth of Hines’ oeuvre contests reductive ideas of working\-class writing as generically limited, building a much richer picture of what it meant to be a working\-class writer in the second half of the twentieth century. 

1.  Hines’ role as a documenter of the political history of northern England has only been partially understood because of the suppression of his output in the final decades of his career. Hines was a first\-hand witness to the 1984\-5 miners’ strike and its aftermath. Scripts of three unproduced plays – *After the Strike* \(1985\), *The Diggers* \(1994\), *Follow the Sun* \(2003\) – and correspondence about them reveal the part played by British broadcasters \(BBC, Channel 4\) in occluding ideologically sensitive material about the strike. The research also shows how Hines struggled to articulate in artistic form the social, cultural, and economic trauma of de\-industrialisation, and helps explain the sudden stalling of his career after the high point of *Threads*.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Forrest and Vice <ins>rehabilitated Hines’ reputation</ins>, using co\-creative practices and varied forms \(oral, written, visual\) to engage diverse audiences. Their championing of Hines led directly to the publisher *And Other Stories* acquiring the rights in 2020 to **publish Hines’ unpublished and out\-of\-print works**, making those available to national and international readerships: without them “ *none of this would have happened*” \[S1\]. 

 The research on Hines underpinned BBC4’s **documentary** *Looking for Kes* \(2019; with total viewing figures of 545,000, it was the channel’s ninth most watched programme in the week that it first aired \[S2\]\). The public interest this inspired is evidenced by the spike in pageviews of Hines’ Wikipedia entry \(23,000\+ post\-screening\), the revision of which Forrest supervised \[S3\]. The research also informed **journalistic work** on Cold War nuclear cultures and sports writing \[S4\]. In particular, the football magazine *When Saturday Comes* \(average monthly circulation, 14,500; online users 210,000\) brought Hines to a different twenty\-first century audience. 

 Showcasing working\-class writing and expressing working\-class experience is crucial owing to the long\-term exclusion of people of working\-class origins from the creative industries \(‘ [<ins>Panic\!</ins>](https://createlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panic-Social-Class-Taste-and-Inequalities-in-the-Creative-Industries1.pdf)’ report, 2018\). Forrest co\-curated two **exhibitions** about Hines’ work with artists Murphy and Want \(2018, 2019\) and delivered over fifteen **public talks** across the UK \(August 2013\-July 2020\), reaching more diverse audiences than such events usually attract, including some of Sheffield’s most deprived postcodes \[S3\]. These activities transformed how people viewed Hines’ work and subject matter, building his audience and fostering interest in working\-class art more widely. Representative comments: *“I found myself looking at the landscape in a way I just wouldn’t have noticed otherwise*”; “ *I’ve had an awakening with art… I’m excited to explore more social realist work*” \[S3\]. 

 Forrest collaborated with Dearne Valley Landscape Partnership, placing Hines at the centre of Heritage Lottery funded **arts and community engagement** regenerating an area devastated by deindustrialisation. A reading group \(2016\) engaged local residents – including ‘reluctant’ adult readers – with Hines’ work and archive. This group co\-produced a **short film**, *Cushion of Mist*, exploring Hines’ evocations of landscape and how his work influenced their understanding of place and belonging \[S5\]. The film was screened in Sheffield \(2017, 2018\) and is available via vimeo \(300\+ plays\). These screenings impacted positively on audience members’ sense of self and well\-being. Representative comments: “ *I felt more connected to my roots and social history*”; “ *the film made me think I should walk in nature more*” \[S3\]. 

 These public\-facing activities generated new collaborations, including the **first public performance** of *After the Strike*, co\-produced with Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign \(2019\), and produced **new material for the archive**, including responses to Hines’ work \(valuable records of reader engagement\) and biographical testimonials. For example, miners who drove Hines while he chronicled the strike approached Forrest after a talk and subsequently provided important information which would otherwise have been lost. 

 Enhancing access to regional films 

 Forrest and Vice curated ‘South Yorkshire Trilogy’ \(Showroom, Sheffield, 2018\), featuring three of Hines’ films, alongside talks and an exhibition, for Film Hub North’s ‘Our North’ season. Screenings were sold out \(350\+ tickets\), **reaching multi\-generational audiences** and **generating income** for an independent cinema during the summer \(usually problematically quiet\) \[S6\]. Increasing access to, and interest in, specialist films is particularly significant in Yorkshire and Humber, which has only  [<ins>7.2% of UK’s specialist cinemas</ins>](https://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-statistical-yearbook-2014.pdf) \(strikingly few, considering the region’s size and population\). The trilogy contributed to the Showroom’s mission to build audiences: its programmer \(Pettersson\) observes that, as a working\-class writer, Hines was especially effective at overcoming socio\-cultural barriers to accessing arts venues \[S6\]. 

 The trilogy’s success **influenced the Showroom’s practice**, demonstrating demand for local stories and giving Pettersson confidence to ‘push back’ when Film Hub North proposed changing the remit of their 2019 season. The interest in the accompanying exhibition also encouraged Pettersson to feature other archives when programming special seasons \[S6\]. 

 Educational impact 

 Forrest’s work with schools focused on *Kestrel for a Knave*. Participants included the University’s post\-16 engagement programme \(2016\), Ecclesfield School \(2015, 2017\), Trinity Academy \(2018\), and Hinde House \(autumn 2013\), based in an economically deprived area of Sheffield \(50%\+ of pupils eligible for free school meals, twice the national average \[S7\]\). Feedback shows the experience **raised aspirations** and **increased pupil engagement**: 95% of Hinde House pupils reported being ‘more interested’ in schoolwork afterwards \[S7\]. 

 Brennan \(teacher, Hinde House; subsequently, Ecclesfield\) found the project transformational for three cohorts of 12\-year\-olds: it gave them “ *intellectual freedom to explore things in their own terms*”, improving the quality of their work, “ *which was more academic than I had seen before*”. The experience also **transformed** Brennan’s **teaching**, demonstrating the value of non\-essay\-based assessments and overturning her assumption that pupils only relate to recent texts. Brennan adopted the project’s methodology of treating pupils as ‘experts in the room’ and developed more collaborative methods of working with them: “ *it’s opened up a lot of doors to me as a teacher which would otherwise have remained closed”*, including inspiring her to work with other academics on a creative\-writing project \(Sheffield Hallam\) and ‘Classics for All’ \(Oxford\) \[S8\]. 

 Artistic impact 

 Making *Cushion of Mist* influenced film\-maker Brown’s creative practice, highlighting the **value of co\-production** and **facilitating more fluid approaches to narrative**, utilised in Brown’s subsequent heritage films \[S9\]. Collaboration with Forrest similarly enhanced Murphy’s and Want’s creative practice, stimulating both a **renewed commitment to working\-class art** and **specific artworks re\-evaluating childhood landscapes** \[S10\]. The collaboration also led to an **exhibition commission** – *Northern Town* \(Barnsley, 2020\) – tracing narratives of social change inspired by Hines’ charting of deindustrialisation.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Information industry actors have developed improved commercial tools and services, supporting the UK to become a world leader in one digital publishing sector with software, consultancy and indicators from the Statistical Cybermetrics Research Group \(SCRG\). Specifically, our methods and findings helped London\-based Digital Science create research impact indicators and alternative impact indicators \(altmetrics\) for scholarly publications for their world\-leading international products, Dimensions.ai and Altmetric.com. We helped UK non\-profit Jisc evaluate the potential to develop commercial tools for the publishing industry and academia. We enabled international commercial software developers to deploy integrated social media analysis products through our sentiment analysis software. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2001, the SCRG has developed and evaluated web\-based indicators for the impact of academic research and a systematic approach for applying them to evaluation contexts. We are world leaders in the number of articles published in the top journals in the field. Initially this was theoretical research, but web indicators later became commercialised in the UK and USA. We have also conducted scientometric research into academic databases and indicator robustness, investigations into academic publishing and sentiment analysis, all of which has supported impact. 

 All the underpinning research in this section has the main author from the SCRG. 

 <ins>Altmetrics1: Validated methodologies for applying altmetrics</ins> 

 Before the founding of the first altmetrics business in 2011, Thelwall contributed more research into altmetrics \(or webometrics, its earlier name\) than anyone else. Of the 87 journal articles in Scopus on the topic, 20 \(23%\) were authored by Thelwall, with the next most common author \(Ortega\) authoring 12. This can be checked with the Scopus advanced query: TITLE\-ABS\-KEY\(webometrics OR altmetrics\) AND PUBYEAR < 2011 AND DOCTYPE\(ar\). Our integrated approach to web indicator applications developed over fifteen years is summarised in a 2017 book \[R1\], showing how to use altmetrics to assess groups of researchers. 

 <ins>Altmetrics2: Web syllabus mentions are an educational impact indicator</ins> 

 Counts of citations to research from web\-based syllabi were developed and shown by Kousha to be a practical and valid indicator of the educational impact of journal articles with an empirical correlation\-based study and theoretical argument that a citation from a syllabus is evidence of use within education \[R1\]. 

 <ins>Altmetrics3: Mendeley reader counts are robust academic impact indictors</ins> 

 Counts of readers in the social reference sharing site Mendeley were demonstrated by the SCRG to be robust early indicators of academic impact. We co\-authored \(with former PhD student Xuemei Li and librarian Dean Giustini\) the first refereed publication on this indicator and have evaluated its capabilities in a series of follow\-up studies, showing primarily through strong correlations with long term citations that it is a robust \(early\) indicator of academic impact \[R1\]. 

 <ins>Altmetrics4: Altmetrics can predict long term citations</ins> 

 Thelwall and Nevill’s large\-scale systematic evaluation \[R2\] showed for the first time that long term citations could be predicted from early altmetric scores, enhancing the commercial value of altmetric data with this proven capability. 

 <ins>Scientometrics1: MNLCS is robust for citation count data</ins> 

 The Mean Normalised Log\-transformed Citation Score \(MNLCS\) is our impact indicator formula that produces a single score for a set of research outputs that has a value above 1 if the average citation \(or other\) impact of the outputs is above average for the world, and less than one if it is below world average \[R1\]. These papers showed that indicators based on log\-transformed citations or altmetrics are far less influenced by individual high scores and give more precise impact estimates than current standard methods, a finding of major significance for research impact assessment, which previously always used less precise measures. 

 <ins>Scientometrics2: Dimensions.ai has similar coverage to Scopus</ins> 

 A systematic evaluation of the commercial academic database and search service Dimensions.ai in comparison to Scopus was its first published scholarly evaluation, showing that its coverage of the academic literature is comparable to Scopus and hence probably wider than the Web of Science \[R3\], making it a credible alternative major academic database. 

 <ins>AcademicPublishing1: Research data is rarely shared, even in ideal conditions</ins> 

 Kousha developed methods to systematically evaluate academic data sharing in digital repositories, with a case study of FigShare. We built on this with a contracted study for Jisc developing and applying a new method to assess the potential for automated data quality assurance in Genomics \[R4\]. The study showed that research data is rarely shared, even in fields that apparently provide ideal circumstances for sharing. 

 <ins>AcademicPublishing2: Open peer review has national but not subsequent\-reviewer biases</ins> 

 A contracted study for Jisc developed and applied a method to test for reviewer bias in open peer review \[R5\]. We found that open publication of reviews before all reports are in did not seem to induce bias, whereas same\-country reviewer bias was occasionally present. 

 <ins>Sentiment1: SentiStrength has human\-level sentiment strength detection accuracy</ins> 

 Our sentiment analysis software SentiStrength produces parallel positive and negative sentiment strength estimates for texts. It is designed for, and evaluated on, social web texts, and it is user\-customisable, fast \(14,000 tweets per second\), and accurate \[R6\]. It is highly cited \(Google Scholar: 1,700\+\) for its broad applicability.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The SCRG contributed to innovation impact on commerce and the economy by providing a wide range of different types of direct support for the academic information industry in the UK and internationally, described below by type. Most impacts are achieved through direct support, but the first is indirect and collaborative in the form of establishing a research area that was subsequently exploited by start\-up companies to create a new type of information industry business. 

 <ins>I1</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Establishment of altmetrics as credible for commercialisation</ins> 

 Altmetric providers were able to establish successful businesses through the SCRG’s establishment of the credibility of altmetrics and webometrics. The SCRG led research into the development of altmetrics and webometric indicators for the impacts of academic research \[Altmetrics1, Altmetrics2, Altmetrics3\]. This research was commercialised from 2011, primarily through the creation of Plum Analytics \(2011\) and London\-based start\-up Altmetric.com \(2011\). For example, Altmetric.com’s business model is based on \(a\) the practicality of systematically gathering altmetric indicators, and \(b\) the value of those indicators to end users, for both of which we played the largest role in terms of the number of refereed journal articles \[Altmetrics1\]. We claim impact from 2014, with our research enabling them to be credible to major academic publishers. Those signing up to Altmetric.com include Wiley \(2014\), Springer \(2014\), Taylor & Francis \(2015\), and the JAMA network \(2017\), collectively publishing 7,200 journals. “Altmetrics research from Thelwall’s team helped make Altmetric.com’s indicators credible to academic publishers, increasing our commercial viability” \(Adie, Altmetric.com founder\). 

 <ins>I2</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Development and evaluation of altmetric indicators</ins> 

 Altmetric.com was able to expand their indicator portfolio with new indicators pioneered by us. These include Mendeley reader counts \(joint\), online syllabus mentions and Wikipedia citations \[Altmetrics2, Altmetrics3\], which are now part of Altmetric.com’s portfolio \[C1\]. These indicators address additional impact dimensions that enhanced the value of Altmetric.com’s product. Altmetric.com were also able to demonstrate the value of their offering to potential customers through our systematic \(non\-commissioned, independent\) study illustrating that Altmetric.com data could help predict longer term citation impact \[Altmetrics4\]. Thelwall gave an invited talk to an Altmetric.com webinar about this research \[C2\], evidencing the value that Altmetric.com placed on getting this message to their audience. The international scholarly community as a whole has benefitted from the altmetrics provided by Altmetric.com and other providers in academic literature databases \(e.g., Dimensions.ai\) and publisher websites, underpinned by our research, as early indicators of interest in academic publications. 

 In 2017 Canadian company TrendMD used the Mendeley readership indicator validated by us \[Altmetrics3\] as an early impact indicator to demonstrate the value of its biomedical research publicity tool, increasing their product reputation \[C3\]. 

 <ins>I3</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Citation analysis and evaluations of Dimensions.ai</ins> 

 London\-based Dimensions.ai \(2018\) developed our world leading citation impact indicator for its citation index, taking into account the citation data skewing that undermines almost all other commercial citation\-based indicators \[Scientometrics1\], which it calls the *Field Citation Ratio* \[C4\]. This increased Dimensions’ viability as a challenger to Scopus and the Web of Science. 

 Dimensions.ai become a viable alternative to the Web of Science and Scopus with the help of our published research, demonstrating that the coverage of Dimensions.ai was comparable to Scopus and hence larger than that of the Web of Science \[Scientometrics2\]. Thelwall gave public talks in 2018 invited by Digital Science \(owners of Dimensions\), online and in person, about this research, and the article was cited by a technical report by the creators of Dimensions.ai \[C5\].

 The UK non\-profit organisation Jisc evaluated the potential to develop commercial tools for the publishing industry and academia with our commissioned, Jisc\-funded 2019 project. Thelwall, Kousha and Mas\-Bleda used experiences of researching data sharing to research the viability of developing software to identify and quality validate data of specific types underpinning journal articles shared by authors. This project, which was research\-based with its findings published as a refereed journal article, showed that non\-mandatory data sharing was too rare to make such a tool viable, even for fields with apparently ideal conditions for sharing \[AcademicPublishing1; the commissioned co\-authored output R4 is the impact evidence\]. “The evidence from the study helped Jisc to decide not to invest in automated data sharing detection tools at this stage and continues to inform discussions around future Jisc open research services and tools.” \(Weigert, Jisc\). 

 Jisc was able to assess the potential for automated peer review, highlighting ethical issues but showing that there was some scope for automated peer review support, but not for fully automated peer review through our commissioned report \[AcademicPublishing2\]. These areas were identified by Jisc as topics that it should scope for UK\-wide support and advice, with the findings enabling Jisc to advise the sector and avoid funding impractical software development. The reports form the evidence that the requested information was delivered \[AcademicPublishing1, AcademicPublishing2\], and Jisc used our evidence for sector advice \[C6, C7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Todd’s research has inspired both professional and amateur theatre groups and writers to perform and reinterpret the work of Shelagh Delaney – a working\-class playwright \(1938\-2012\) – in ways that attracted new audiences. Most specifically, theatre directors and writers have used Todd’s research to develop their artistic practice by foregrounding women’s writing and experiences. Todd’s work has also helped to extend the reach of cultural organisations by encouraging women and young people in the Greater Manchester area to participate in the arts. In these ways, the research has increased public understanding of Delaney’s work and of working\-class culture. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning this case study was undertaken in three related projects on which Todd was Principal Investigator: G1: ‘A biographical study of Shelagh Delaney’ \(Arts Council funded, 2014\-15\), G2: ‘Feminism, culture and women’s lives in Britain c.1945\-c.2015’ \(AHRC funded, 2017\-18\), and G3: ‘Housing, culture and women’s citizenship in Britain c.1945 to the present’ \(AHRC funded, 2018\-19\). 

 G1 examined the life and work of Shelagh Delaney \(1938\-2012\) using unpublished papers and interviews with Delaney’s family and friends. G2 and G3 analysed how Delaney’s working\-class background informed her work, and examined its relevance for young people and women in 21<sup>st</sup> century Salford \(Delaney’s home town, and an area of high socio\-economic deprivation\). G2 and G3 also disseminated Delaney’s work to audiences in north\-west England. 

 Todd’s research uncovered aspects of Delaney’s life, and several of her works, that had previously been overlooked by scholars and cultural practitioners. Delaney was a teenager when her debut play, *A Taste of Honey*, had its premiere in 1958. *Honey* was a box\-office hit and adapted into a film in 1961; it has been staged around the world and is on GCSE English and Drama syllabuses. *Honey* centres on Jo, a white, working\-class teenager who gets pregnant while having a brief relationship with a black sailor. Many productions, along with most of the limited scholarship on Delaney, have been overly influenced by the approaches of *Honey*’s first director, Joan Littlewood, and of Tony Richardson, who directed the film adaptation. Littlewood emphasised the brutality of working\-class life \(through casual racism and homophobia\), while Richardson foregrounded heterosexual romance. In contrast, Delaney’s original script focused on the complex relationship between Jo and her single mother, Helen. 

 Scholars and practitioners have also wrongly assumed that Littlewood was solely responsible for the avant\-garde aspects of *Honey,* such as the use of live music and breaking of the fourth wall. Todd’s research showed that these innovations resulted from collaboration with Delaney, whose attempt to capture women’s dreams and frustrations drew on music hall, Samuel Beckett and cinema. The tendency of scholars and directors to categorise Delaney as a social realist has overlooked her interest in exploring emotion and desire in women’s lives. 

  

 Delaney’s later work similarly foregrounded working\-class women’s lives and voices. While many commentators assume she stopped writing after *Honey*, Todd’s research revealed that she enjoyed a long career as a writer for theatre, film and television. Her work showcased the richness of women’s voices and illuminated aspects of their lives – including mother/daughter relationships and female friendship in older age – that remains neglected in the media and the arts today. 

 Todd developed these conclusions in her book *Tastes of Honey: The Making of Shelagh Delaney and a Cultural Revolution*.\[R1\] Todd’s key research findings informed the collaborations and inspired the new cultural work described in Section 4: 

-  Delaney’s work developed from and contributed to a rich community culture, and subsequent generations have found the work captivating. Todd’s research challenges prevailing political rhetoric and cultural policies that treat such communities as ‘marginal’ to cultural life, or as lacking ‘cultural capital’. 

-  Delaney’s career was facilitated by radical and socialist theatre and by the welfare state, and her work needs to be understood in relation to an ongoing tradition of innovative local arts initiatives, often run as grass\-roots enterprises. Greater opportunities to meet the existing demand within local communities are vital to sustain levels of aspiration and cultural engagement, contrary to some current media and political assertions.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Todd’s research **increased cultural participation in working\-class areas.** In 2016 Todd’s research inspired **MaD Theatre Company** – a community theatre based in north Manchester – to create a Delaney Theatre Group \(DTG\) in premises in Salford owned by the Guinness Partnership, an affordable housing provider. MaD’s Co\-Director notes that ‘thanks to Selina’s work, which demonstrated the importance of Shelagh Delaney’s work, the Guinness Partnership agreed to support us in establishing the Delaney Community Theatre Group’.\[E1, E2\] 

 Inspired by Todd’s research, and supported by her AHRC grants, the DTG staged an adaptation of a trilogy of Shelagh Delaney’s short stories, *Sweetly Sings the Donkey*, at The Lowry, Salford in September 2017 \(2 sell\-out performances; total audience 240\). A BBC North West news report, broadcast in 2017, highlighted that the members of the DTG were ‘amateur actors who grew up on the same streets’ as Shelagh Delaney.\[E3\] The Co\-Director of MaD reports that participation developed members’ confidence, encouraged some to achieve professional qualifications and led others ‘to create their own plays that have been performed at Greater Manchester Fringe’.\[E1\] 

 Cultural organisations and practitioners were major beneficiaries of Todd’s research. Todd led two public workshops on her research at the Working Class Movement Library, Salford **.** The Library Manager states that these ‘drew in many local people who had not visited the Library before’, **increasing public engagement with the Library**.\[E4\] 

 The research **helped MaD to expand their cultural practice and network, with lasting benefits.** The company’s Co\-Director writes that their partnership with Todd was ‘a new and fruitful departure…as until then we had staged our own work’.\[E1\] The Lowry’s Senior Theatres Programmer and Producer notes that ‘Professor Todd’s work in raising the profile of the playwright to new local audiences’ helped persuade The Lowry to stage the DTG’s performances.\[E5\] The Co\-Director reports that ‘as a direct result of \[the project\], MaD was able to establish a much needed relationship with The Lowry’. This is ‘invaluable…as it introduces our work to new audiences from beyond the districts of Manchester where our participants live’.\[E1\] 

 The research partnership **enabled MaD and** **The Lowry to increase audience reach**. Lowry staff ‘were delighted with the response and \[the opportunity\] to engage so directly with people who were new to The Lowry and theatre generally’.\[E5\] 31% of the DTG’s audience had attended a theatre twice or less in the 12 months prior to the performance; 19% had not attended a theatre in this period.\[E6\] Todd’s research thus **enabled MaD to achieve its aim of ‘produc\[ing\] theatre by and for people who would not normally attend’**.\[E1\] 

 Todd’s research \(e.g. R1\) contributed to an increased affinity among the project partners with Delaney’s social themes. Through their production and performances, they renewed **public interest in Delaney’s work and challenged negative stereotypes of working\-class life.** The BBC North West report observed that ‘Salford born Shelagh Delaney became an overnight success with her ground\-breaking debut play’ and emphasised that DTG members came from ‘the same streets’. By 31 July 2020 this report had been viewed on Facebook approximately 37,000 times.\[E3\] Audience members at the DTG’s performances of *Sweetly Sings the Donkey* praised the positive portrayal of northern working\-class life: ‘very northern, very Salford\!’.\[E7.1\] The performances also enriched spectators’ understanding of Delaney’s work: ‘\[I have gained\] More understanding of her work and would like to now know more’;\[E7.2\] ‘\[I learned\] that she continued to write wonderful plays throughout her life. Now I want to see more’.\[E7.3\] 

 The research **encouraged practitioners and participants to represent and value working\-class women’s experiences**. Todd commissioned freelance writer **Charlotte Delaney** to adapt *Sweetly Sings the Donkey* for the DTG’s stage performances. This was Charlotte Delaney’s first stage adaptation, and success gave her ‘the confidence to take the rigour of academic research and apply it to the conversations, relationships and choices made by “everyday” women’ in her subsequent work.\[E8\] Charlotte Delaney led three creative writing workshops at a women’s refuge in Salford where, influenced by Todd’s research she encouraged ‘women to explore their own voices’. This helped some participants to become ‘more confident at speaking for themselves in difficult situations’.\[E8\] Todd’s work inspired MaD to include ‘\[Shelagh\] Delaney’s life and work in a commissioned production for the Co\-operative Group’ about Manchester, in order to show that ‘ordinary women played a huge part in the cultural heritage of Greater Manchester’.\[E1\] 

 Todd’s work was an **‘invaluable resource’ for the 2019\-20 National Theatre production of **A Taste of Honey**. It helped the director ‘understand…\[how\] some of Shelagh’s difficult early experiences were expressing themselves through the play’. Cast members read Todd’s *Tastes of Honey* so that ‘we were able to begin our rehearsal period with a shared in\-depth knowledge of the \[play’s\] background’.\[E9\] The director had previously directed a 2014 production of *Honey*, but Todd’s research changed his interpretation of the play. He and his team ‘developed one of the main ideas of this production – the relationship between the audience, the live music and the actors – through our conversations with Selina’.\[E9\] The resulting production had more than 80 sold\-out performances in ten venues, including The Lowry \(with combined Lowry audiences estimated at c.10,000\) **.** The *Guardian*’s reviewer noted that some productions of *Honey* ‘seem a little patronising, as if the 19\-year\-old Delaney merely had a certain authenticity to offer’, whereas the production by the National Theatre ‘isn’t particularly interested in being “real” and is all the more interesting for it’.\[E10\] Todd’s research thus **generated new ways of thinking about and understanding Delaney’s work.**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mohamed\-Salah Omri’s collaborative programme of research and public engagement – *Arab Revolutions and New Humanism* \(ARNH\) – started in 2013 and ongoing throughout the REF period, provided new perspectives on post\-authoritarian practices of knowledge exchange, education and civic engagement in post\-revolution Tunisia. ARNH contributed to: 1\) collaboration between regional and metropolitan universities, benefitting local civil society associations and cultural policy makers; 2\) informing and enabling cultural practitioners in a deprived region of the country; 3\) co\-development of new modes of governance committed to interactive learning anchored in explorations of themes of local and global relevance; and 4\) practical collaboration between British and Tunisian universities in the areas of capacity building and policy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prior to 2011, the study of the Arab World was conceived largely within two frameworks: 1\) a space of dominant authoritarian rule with no possibility of democratic change; 2\) a presumption that the region’s societies were considered already known, and not seen as producers of knowledge. These perceptions were rooted in orientalist and colonial paradigms that are much criticized yet still influential across fields of knowledge. In relation to the first theme, Omri’s research focuses on two strands. The first is uncovering a culture of resistance and protest to authoritarian rule in Tunisia. The second is sustained critique of the patterns and dynamics governing the traffic of knowledge within Arab societies and their relationship to the “West”. With regard to the first strand, Omri published essays on the politics and culture of memory **\(R1\),** torture and literature \( **R2**\), transitional justice and memorialisation \( **R3**\), and the long history of resistance in Tunisia **\(R4\).** In relation to the second strand, the key term in his research is *tarafud* \(glossed in English as “confluency”\), a concept he coined initially to describe relationships among world literatures, away from hierarchy, domination and one\-dimensional influence. *Tarafud* has applications beyond the field of literature. Omri uses it to discuss intersections between labour activism, revolution and cultural production in Tunisia, and a critical relationship of knowledge between what we may call centre and periphery \( **R5**\). In his publications he also explores the need to reclaim local history and subjectivity, and the decolonisation of knowledge about Tunisia. 

 In the aftermath of the 2011 revolution, Omri initiated a programme of research and public engagement *– Arab Revolutions and New Humanism* *–* and began collaborating with political philosopher Mohsen ElKhouni \(University of Tunis al\-Manar\), sociologist Mouldi Guessoumi \(University of Tunis\), and comparative literature scholar Ronald A.T. Judy \(University of Pittsburgh\). ARNH was conceived as an intervention in what Frantz Fanon identified in *The Wretched of the Earth* \(1963\) as a need to express emergent perspectives on humanism. Fanon advocated awareness of cultural diversity, multiple sources of subjectivity and critique of power relations in the production and circulation of knowledge. ARNH sought to respond to the frameworks mentioned above \(that the Arab world is intrinsically authoritarian, and that it will always be a receiver of knowledge, never a producer of it\) by putting into practice alternative dynamics for the traffic of knowledge between university and society. This includes underpinning principles drawn from Fanon’s thought and Gramscian practices of counterhegemony. These are laid out in Omri’s contribution to the book *University and Society in the Context of Arab Revolutions and New Humanism* \( **R6**\). 

 The book is characterised by its multidisciplinary and multilingual framework, with 24 essays from the fields of humanities and social sciences written in Arabic, French and English.  It brings together perspectives from Tunisia, Latin America, North America, Eastern Europe and Sub\-Saharan Africa into a common academic and practical frame, which included labour unions in post\-authoritarian societies, transitional justice and the role of universities in democratising societies. The project was largely funded by the German Rosa Luxemburg Foundation and two local research laboratories in Tunisia.

 **Facilitated local partnerships in rethinking education and cultural participation** 

 After the launch of ARNH a study day and one international conference were held with the aim of establishing collaboration between regional and central universities in Tunisia, particularly in Kasserine, the poorest region in the country. Kasserine has a population of c.500,000 and possesses rich agricultural assets and a substantial proportion of the country’s ancient ruins, which have not been effectively leveraged to bring in tourism. The study day \(on 2\-3 April 2015\) brought together project leaders with local academics and policy makers, as well as civil society associations. It resulted in a major international conference, University and Society in the Context of New Humanism, held in Kasserine \(12\-14 April 2016\). The Regional Representative of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs in the Governorate of Kasserine said: “Our work with Professor Omri started by analysing the cultural reality in the region, diagnosing and identifying shortcomings, and seeking to find a participatory approach that is inclusive and brings all parties to the table to search for solutions and allocate responsibilities. The main focus was the university’s role in breaking the cultural blockade on the local community.” **\(E1\)** The participants included members of Amal \(“hope”\) Association for Solidarity, Development and Knowledge, a local NGO, as well as local cultural policymakers and cultural producers. They were put in productive dialogue with academic experts from the Institut Supérieur des Arts et Métiers of Kasserine and University of Tunis al\-Manar. The local participants learned how to organise seminars, present ideas to a varied audience, collaborate with diverse of stake holders, and set local priorities in breaking the isolation of the region from institutions of knowledge production. The Amal President explains: “We had the honor to work with Professor Omri on most of his activities and projects in the city of Kasserine as equal partners which was in itself a new initiative that impacted positively…. Such collaborations involved overseeing the project from its very inception through to its design and its implementation in an interactive and participatory manner... In addition, \[the work\] breaks the city’s knowledge isolation by opening a space for local activists to benefit from experiences and knowledge not only from various parts of Tunisia but also from South America and Europe. Such a methodology contributed to breaking the ice between the public institutions, on one hand, and the local authorities and young people, on the other, whose interactions have often been marked by rigidity and a lack of trust. Equally, it extended an interactive bridge between regional actors in our Association\-run projects which, in turn, established relationships that continued beyond these conferences, making the educational institutions in the region and the local authorities’ *actual* partners in most activities”. **\(E5\)** 

 **Informed debate on heritage management; improved relations between institutions of culture and university; reconnected Tunisians with their history and local identity**. 

 Stage 3 of ARNH addressed isolation of the Kasserine region through collaborating with local actors in the *Kasserine Forum for University and Society: Knowledge between the Local and the Global* \(28\-30 September 2018\). **\(E4\)** The event featured academic presentations designed for a diverse public, aiming to provide a safe environment for discussing the work of local artists with elected local officials of the municipalities of Kasserine City and Kasserine Ennour and archaeology conservators and local cultural authorities.  The full evaluation of the event’s impact by both Amal and through a survey designed in Oxford revealed that of 250 people attending over three days, 49% were female and 51% male, with 24% under 20, 45% between 20 and 40 and 31% over 40, demonstrating both gender balance and youth participation. Several responses to the survey stressed how much the event changed participants’ perception of art and the role of culture in combatting radicalisation. \( **E3\)** One high school student said: “I presented a poem for criticism and learned a lot from the comments”.  **\(E2\)** An activist from the city of Sousse said: “I hope this initiative will be emulated in other parts of the country”. **\(E2\)** Some of those involved in the event continued their own projects afterwards, notably a children’s writing workshop led by writer Mohamed Hizi and an annual symposium on sculpture using local material by partner artist Mohsen Jelliti. The Amal President notes: “Relationships were established and lasted beyond these conferences. Educational institutions in the region and local authorities became real partners in the activities of local associations”. He highlighted two specific projects undertaken by his association as a result of this: a\) Ittisal, a project implemented by the Amal Association in 2019, in partnership with the University of Tunis, aiming to supervise young people who show violent behaviours by offering them, alongside their families, psycho\-social therapy; and b\) an advocacy campaign held in 2019 to enact a law regulating social security economy in full partnership with the Higher Institute of Arts and Crafts in Kasserine. **\(E5\)** 

 **Co\-production of new governance and pedagogy at the University of Tunis al\-Manar**. 

 Omri facilitated reform of higher education in Tunisia by raising public awareness through widely circulated media essays. For example, his interview on higher education in Tunisia in the newspaper *al\-Maghreb* was viewed more than 3700 times. **\(E6\)** Omri contributed to improving support for postgraduate training and improving governance at the Higher Institute of Humanities \(ISSH\). The Director of the Institute, which has 3,100 students, wrote: “Our cooperation with Professor Omri focused on the transfer of experiences in relation to the university’s participatory management and its outreach strategy”. \( **E9\)** 

 Omri also contributed to modes of teaching and interactive learning through multiple disciplines. The first of two study days, titled “Carthage: History and Place,” was held on 7 April 2019 and benefitted 80 students. One student considered it “a revision of methods of communication: the university outside its walls, the university in society”. He highlighted the opportunity to connect theoretical academic knowledge with a physical space, which constitutes a personal and national value to the students. \( **E7\)** One female student commented: “By leaving the closed environment of the classroom, we found ourselves more at ease to learn”. **\(E8**\) A male student said: “The student realises that the course is related to his own life, not just a means to a job”. **\(E8**\) The Director of the Institute explained in a written testimony: “These pedagogical activities have been well received by students and researchers and are part of renewing research and teaching methodologies at the transitional period for the university and the country as a whole.” \( **E9\)** 

 **Facilitated and contributed to a new UK\-Tunisia Joint Commission** 

 The UK\-Tunisia Higher Education Joint Commission was established in January 2018, following a suggestion made by Omri to the deputy British Ambassador in December 2017. \( **E10**\) The Commission provides a framework for universities in both countries as well as other stakeholders to make a “step\-change” in cooperation in research and teaching by 2021. The British Council Director and Cultural Counsellor at the British Embassy in Tunisia writes: “The Commission has had the good fortune to count Professor Omri as one of its most committed and knowledgeable members. In addition to playing an active part in the initial setting of the aims and shape of the Commission, Professor Omri has carved out a major role in serving as bridge between the two educational cultures, having had education, management and teaching experience in both systems… In addition to providing general advice to the Commission he has focused particularly on mobility \[between Tunisia and the UK\] and capacity\-building and has been crucial in orienting the work of the commission at its six\-monthly meetings in Tunis and London.” \( **E11**\) One outcome of mobility was the organisation of an Arabic Year Abroad option for University of Oxford students at the Bourguiba Institute in Tunis; arrangements have also been made for students from the University of Exeter to study at the Institute. \( **E12.v**\) Another outcome was the increased success of the Chevening scholarship programme for Tunisians to study in UK universities \( **E12.iv**\); a third was establishing cooperation between the UK and Tunisia in the area of quality assurance \( **E11**\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study accounts for the impact created by the reported activities and outputs produced by a small team of researchers active at the Faringdon Centre \(Non\-Destructive Research and Testing Centre\) at the University of West London. The case study concentrates specifically on the applications of the Ground Penetrating Radar \(GPR\) and the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar \(InSAR\) satellite imaging techniques within the context of health monitoring and assessment of trees \(early decay and trunk integrity\), highways and airfield infrastructures \(bridges, tunnels, pavements, taxiways and runways\), railway tracks \(foundation and ballast conditions\) and archaeology \(ancient structures and monuments\). It reports on impact with communities and industries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2017 the University of West London embarked upon the development of the Faringdon Centre \(Non\-Destructive Research Centre\) in collaboration with several philanthropic organisations and trusts including The Lord Faringdon Charitable Trust, The Schroder Foundation, The Cazenove Charitable Trust, The Ernest Cook Trust and others. A significant University of West London investment, in terms of funding, expertise \(researchers\) and space, was provided. Parallel to this, external funding, and internal investment, of over £750,000 was obtained to support the multi\-disciplinary research and development work of the Centre. 

 The main identified areas that brought academics, philanthropic and community organisations and industry stakeholders together was the effectiveness of the applications of the non\-destructive testing methods in health monitoring and assessment of environmental and highways and public transport infrastructure assets. 

 The Centre’s specific research initiatives revolves around the following development and application areas: 

-  Advanced signal/data processing and numerical modelling for non\-destructive testing methods. 

-  Assessing the condition of railway ballast using GPR and InSAR satellite imaging technology – experimental, numerical and field project\-based developments. 

-  Monitoring the health of ancient and mature trees, identifying early signs of decay and measuring the extent of defects in tree trunks. 

-  Investigating tree root and soil interactions, and tree roots mass density and architecture, using GPR. 

-  Monitoring the integrity and health of bridges, and other civil and engineering structures, using GPR and InSAR satellite imaging technology including the development of novel site operation and data acquisition methods, data processing and interpretation. 

-  Investigating archaeological sites and features of historical and cultural values using GPR and 3D\-Laser scanner. 

 In summary, the Centre’s main achievements through the underpinning research in these areas of endeavour have been: 

-  New numerical methods, fully automatic imaging algorithms for processing GPR data and numerical modelling with applications in assessment of the tree trunks and roots architecture \(leading to estimating the root mass density\) have been developed and tested successfully. \[R1 & R2\] 

-  Identifying parameters and elements for designing and developing a dedicated GPR antenna system for tree assessment purposes, leading to the first design configuration and manufacture of new\-generation GPR antenna systems \(prototypes\). \[Publications have been withheld to date to protect intellectual property rights.\] 

-  In collaboration with industry, developed a new computer\-aided multi\-stage methodology to control the integrity and monitoring of railway ballast \(experimental, numerical, and modelling framework to identify location and scale of ballast fouling\). \[R3\] 

-  In collaboration with industry stakeholders and the European Space Agency, developed a multi\-source, multi\-scale, and multi\-temporal data system by integration of GPR and the InSAR techniques \(satellite imaging\) for the health monitoring and assessment of modern and historical bridges. The development included advanced data processing and data fusion between the adopted methodologies. \[R4\] 

-  In collaboration with NEDO \(Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization\), the Centre developed a new approach to detect the interlayer debonding phenomenon at early\-stages using a multi\-static GPR system. Also, the development of an advanced, accurate imaging method for a ground based synthetic aperture radar \(GB\-SAR\) system. This development takes the advantage of the optimal transform of the spatial frequency changes under the fractional Fourier transform. \[R5 & R6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research by the Faringdon Centre has been used to understand the condition of both natural and built structures through applying a range of non\-destructive technologies – ground penetrating and airborne radars, satellite imaging and 3D laser scanner – to achieve pioneering results. This has led to novel applications with commercial and economic benefits, as well as benefits for the management of the natural environment. These benefits have been achieved through collaborations with leading international and national companies producing NDT technologies and tools, as well as with infrastructure operators. 

 Environmental and infrastructural impacts and benefits have been achieved on a regional, national and international basis through work with local authorities, arboriculturists, medium and large\-scale enterprises in the UK and Europe by applying non\-destructive technologies to the assessment of tree health, roads and highways, and railways infrastructures. In particular, the collaboration with international giants, such as IDS GeoRadar \(Part of Hexagon\), an Italian\-based leading manufacturer of aerospace and NDT testing systems and equipment including GPR antenna systems and interferometric radar technologies, has been instrumental in widening the Centre’s engagement with major projects. This has supported the development of novel data processing techniques, along with the design of a dedicated set of GPR antenna systems for health monitoring and assessment of tree trunks and tree roots. \[S1\] 

 Much of this impact flowed from the Centre’s active role in the European COST project, TU1208.  The main purpose of this multi\-national project, part of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology programme, was to exchange and increase scientific\-technical knowledge and experience of ground penetrating radar techniques in civil engineering, whilst promoting wider and more effective use of this safe and non\-destructive method in the monitoring of structures. Alani was one of the two UK representatives on the management committee and together with Tosti had leading roles in several working groups, as well as on the coordination of activities, organisation of annual seminars and workshops associated with the Action. \[S2\] 

####  Impact A – Railway infrastructure maintenance and management 

 The Centre’s research findings on the health monitoring and assessment of railway tracks integrity \[R5\], have been applied by railway infrastructure managers in Italy to address limitations in the early\-stage identification of structural decay in ballast foundations \(ballast fouling\) at the network level. This information is regarded as crucial because decay processes can compromise structural integrity, and maintenance must be prioritised based on actual risk levels. 

 In May 2017, the company – Ferrovie del Gargano srl – worked with the Centre to use advanced GPR technology and InSAR satellite techniques to undertake integrated health monitoring of two sections of their lines, covering inspection tasks including identifying areas of widespread ballast fouling and the monitoring of differential settlements on transition areas at the rail\-bridges abutments. 

 Following these inspections, the company’s manager responsible for the Infrastructure Division has written to confirm that: “ *The novelty of the ground\-based GPR inspections and the integrated approach with the InSAR technique and advances in terms of methodology applied for field surveying of railways are of great value to the maintenance agencies.  This was clearly supported by the validation of the results, proving the effectiveness of the newly developed algorithms in data processing at mapping decay inside railway track\-beds”.* \[S3\] 

####  Impact B – Health monitoring of trees and tree roots and soil interaction 

 Although ground penetrating radar is a relatively mature technology, the application and methodologies, processing, and interpretation of GPR data remains challenging and highly affected by noise and clutter, as well as by the competence of the user.  In addition, a lack of automatic detection schemes results in subjective interpretations that are influenced by the biases of the user.  The Centre’s research findings, developments, and knowledge accumulation have included: 

-  Understanding the transmission of the electromagnetic waves in different trees species with varied moisture contents. 

-  Establishing existing GPR systems and their limitations with respect to the assessment of trees and tree roots integrity. 

-  Assessing the limitations of the commercially available software and data processing tools and techniques, and field survey and data collection methodologies. 

 These findings have led to a significant number of impactful cases in collaboration with local authorities, industries, and research communities. 

 The Centre has developed several enhanced imaging algorithms for detection of decay and cavities in trees. By applying a pioneering detection framework \(tomographic migration\), it has been able to produce new predictions to locate and show the scale of decay in tree trunks, with application in forestry management and arboriculture. The significance of the outcomes was received with interest by an audience of practitioners and experts at a London Tree Officers Association \(LTOA\) seminar in July 2019. This led to series of new collaborations with practitioners and stakeholders within the field. \[R1 & R2\] and \[S6\] 

 The Centre has developed an enhanced data processing framework for mapping tree root systems’ architecture and mass density enabling it to identify tree root patterns up to a depth of 0.50m. This development had a great impact on the assessment of several well\-established trees in two London boroughs \[S6\]. A paper on this pioneering work was awarded the “Best Paper Award” at 2020 IEEE 43rd international conference \(TSP – IEEE Conference Record \#49548\). The Centre is currently engaged with the assessment of the oldest Lebanese cedar tree in the UK, located in the London Borough of Hounslow. 

####  Impact C \- Health monitoring of roads and highway infrastructures – GPR, Interferometric Radar and Satellite\-based remote monitoring techniques 

 Roads and highway infrastructures, including bridges and tunnels, are major investments requiring viable and strategic maintenance and management. In recent years, the application of non\-destructive testing techniques such as 3D laser scanners, ultrasound techniques, fibre optic sensors, and accelerometers, as well as ground penetrating radar technologies, have been developed for use in this area of endeavour. Faringdon Centre research has taken this forward by contributing significantly to supporting industry and stakeholders within the field. 

  

 The underpinning research on the health monitoring of highway infrastructures at the Centre has led to collaborations with several partners at national and international level. Since its inception the Centre has been engaged with several projects concerning the health monitoring of bridges and highway infrastructures using innovative approaches based on data integration between satellite imaging and ground\-based non\-destructive testing methods. To this end, the Centre has proactively collaborated with the Rochester Bridge Trust to use InSAR and GPR technologies for monitoring and assessment of bridges owned or associated with the Trust including, masonry arch bridges. \[S7\] Structural displacements of the “Old Bridge” at Aylesford, North Kent, UK – a 13th century bridge – was monitored using satellite data covering a period of 26 months in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency \(ASI\). GPR proved to be instrumental at providing the details of the inner structure of the bridge in terms of geometry and integrity of materials as well as in locating positions of the structural ties. Furthermore, InSAR identified measures of structural displacements caused by the seasonal variation of the water level in the river and the riverbed soil expansions. This pioneering work allowed the Aylesford Parish Council to carry out remedial work on the bridge. 

 The collaboration with the Rochester Bridge Trust, the ASI and Roma\-Tre University in Italy, provided further opportunities for the Centre to develop and apply more advanced data processing algorithms for satellite imaging and GPR data \(based on data fusion of multi\-resolution datasets and data clustering for detailed and more accurate monitoring of the structural elements of bridges\). This has been applied to the Rochester Bridge \(a major bridge spanning the River Medway – an ongoing project\) and a railway bridge in West London in 2019 \(part of Network Rail\). It is important to report that the Centre’s proposed multi\-temporal InSAR technique was effective at detecting areas subject to an evolving subsidence and down\-lifting displacements on the Rochester Bridge. 

 The Centre was also engaged with several major projects for monitoring runways and taxiways in different international airports. This included Runway 3 at the International Airport of “Leonardo Da Vinci” in Rome, Italy, in 2019, in collaboration with ASI and Roma\-Tre University in Italy. The runway was subject to serious differential settlements due to consolidation of the foundation materials over time.  The affected areas had previously been subject to successive remediation and repair works at significant financial cost. The scope of the project was to develop a new pavement management approach based on a systematic and integrated use of satellite data. The analysis of the medium and high\-resolution data covered the period between January 2015 to April 2019 using the Persistent Scatterers Interferometry \(PSI\) technique. The reported results were conclusive in terms of accuracy and significance presenting a viable alternative to conventional time\-consuming methods for pavement monitoring. 

 The significance of the outcome of Centre’s work was well received by important industrial partners within the aerospace sector. Drawing on their research on the applications of aircraft\-based SAR imaging technique in interaction with InSAR imaging, the Centre has collaborated with Umbria Aerospace Systems and Roma\-Tre University in the development of innovative sensor systems synchronised with satellite remote sensing measurements for long\-term non\-destructive assessment and monitoring of transport infrastructure. \[S3\] A major R&D proposal has also been submitted to the European Space Agency \(with support of ASI and UK Space Agency\) on the same subject. 

 The Centre’s further research impact with industry and communities has been witnessed in the work reported in section 3 of this document. \[R6\]   Samples of the Centre’s research work on the health monitoring of highway infrastructures has been reflected in several COST Action TU1208 proceedings within the context of guidelines in the applications of GPR in civil engineering infrastructure for European communities. \[S2\] 

####  Impact D – Surveying archaeological and cultural heritage sites 

 The Centre has worked in conjunction with GEOSERVICE, an Athens\-based geophysics services company, to demonstrate an improved approach in the application of NDT methods to archaeological investigations.  This led to the demonstration of a use of multi\-frequency GPR equipment, surveying methodology and newly developed data processing techniques on the mosaics of a Roman villa in Athens in conjunction with the Ministry of Culture.  The tests carried out were used to verify the integrity and homogeneity of the structural layer underlying the mosaic using an integrated GPR surveying technique. 

 The CEO of GEOSERVICE endorsed this work and has reported that: *“...the integrated surveying methodologies, the GPR equipment and the algorithms developed by the Faringdon Centre team are now currently used by professionals and practitioners in this area of endeavour”*. \[S5\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The UK is distinctive internationally because of its related problems of large spatial economic inequalities and highly centralised governance. Demonstrating the extent and nature of these issues, CURDS’ research has strengthened subnational economic development and decentralisation policy through 3 key impacts: 

1.  Improved national level devolution **policy** for England by defining the aims, criteria, and forms of the decentralisation of powers and resources; 

1.  Strengthened subnational **governance** by clarifying the purpose and roles of Local Enterprise Partnerships in England and enhancing their accountability and performance monitoring; 

1.  Upgraded **design and delivery** of strategies, policies, and evaluations by assessing City and Regional Growth Deals in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

 The Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies \(CURDS\) at Newcastle University has a longstanding national and international reputation for theoretically\-informed and policy\-relevant territorial development research. Since 2008, utilising geographical political economy theory and supported by national funding bodies, CURDS revealed the constraints of highly centralised governance and potential of subnational economic development and decentralisation policy to reduce UK spatial economic inequalities. The research has demonstrated how the UK’s overly\-centralised governance causes inefficient resource allocation, under\-utilises economic potential, reinforces London\-oriented decision\-making, and entrenches spatial economic inequalities **\(G1, PUB1, 2\)**. CURDS’ research showed how the design and institutional arrangements of the UK Government’s subnational economic development and decentralisation policy in England from 2008 shaped its effectiveness **\(G1, PUB2, 3\)**. CURDS’ research underpinned impacts in three key areas: 

1.  <ins>D</ins><ins>e</ins><ins>fin</ins><ins>ing</ins> <ins>the aims,</ins> <ins>criteria</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>forms of decentralisation in England</ins> 

 In 2009 CURDS was commissioned by the then UK Department for Communities and Local Government \(CLG\), responsible for subnational development and governance, to establish the principles, rationales, and evidence base for the UK government’s new decentralisation policy in England from 2010 **\(G2\)**. This research was amongst the first to identify distinct decentralisation types with different powers and resources at specific geographical scales and demonstrate their influence on public policy outcomes and economic growth **\(PUB3\)**. Additional CURDS research revealed the *ad hoc*, piecemeal, and rapid nature of decentralisation and the UK Government's patchwork of initiatives in England since 2010. This work identified these policies’ limitations in reducing large spatial economic inequalities and highly centralised governance due to limited decentralisation of powers and resources, ongoing institutional reorganisation, and lack of national and subnational co\-ordination **\(G3, PUB2, 4, 5\)**. CURDS explained the rationales, principles, and types underpinning this approach to decentralisation, making one of the first calls for a ‘road map’ to clarify and strengthen the vision, purpose, and principles for subnational governance in England to better address spatial economic inequalities and over\-centralisation **\(G4, PUB1, 2, 3, 5\)**. 

1.  <ins>Clarif</ins><ins>ying</ins> <ins>the purpose</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>roles</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>Local Enterprise Partnerships</ins> <ins>\(LEPs\)</ins> <ins>in England</ins> 

 In 2013, CURDS undertook the first national review of the 39 new LEPs responsible for promoting local growth across England and over GBP10,000,000,000 funding from 2014. The research assessed their roles, strategies, and prospects, and revealed LEPs were attempting to lead and integrate decision\-making with multiple funding streams. It also demonstrated that LEPs were constrained in boosting local economic growth and reducing spatial economic inequalities by their centralised governance framework, lack of long\-term vision and strategy, relatively limited resources, and fundamental but unresolved issues \(e.g. autonomy, scale\) **\(G1, PUB5\)**. Enhancing LEP development and effectiveness, CURDS’ research demonstrated the need for clearer purpose and roles, enhanced powers and resources, and stronger governance and performance monitoring. 

1.  <ins>Assessing</ins> <ins>City and Regional Growth Deals in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland</ins> 

 CURDS undertook the first national assessment of the 33 City Deals and their approximately GBP4,000,000,000 funding across the UK from 2011 **\(G4, PUB6\)**. These deals between central and local governments devolved powers and resources with the aim of reducing spatial economic inequalities and over\-centralised governance in England and extended into the devolved nations. CURDS’ pioneering research explained the informal governance innovation of deal\-making by identifying its advantages \(e.g. local\-national communication, vision\) and disadvantages \(e.g. central control, uneven resource allocation\) in tackling spatial economic inequalities and over\-centralisation. Proposing refinements of the City and later City Regional and Growth Deals, the research identified innovations to improve policy effectiveness, including clarifying their strategy, accountability, and evaluation **\(G4, PUB6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 CURDS’ research has resulted in improvements to subnational economic development and decentralisation policy to address better the UK’s large spatial economic inequalities *and* highly centralised governance in 3 connected ways: 

1.  <ins>Improved national level devolution</ins> <ins> **policy**</ins> <ins>for England by defining the aims, criteria, and</ins> <ins>forms of the decentralisation of powers and resources</ins> 

 CURDS’ research has significantly influenced UK Government perspectives on devolution and has provided new evidence to enable improved evidence\-based decision\-making and more coherent national policies to address the problems of spatial economic inequalities and over\-centralised governance. Between 2014 and 2016, 2 key House of Commons CLG Committee inquiries into the department’s spending and policies drew substantially on CURDS’ research \(cited 13 times\) **\(IMP1a, b\)** to recommend the creation of a clearer framework for devolution. This proposal was acknowledged in the UK Government’s 2016 response in seeking to develop its “broad, enabling framework” to provide a “good basis for the devolution agenda to continue to evolve over time” **\(IMP1c\)**. Reflecting CURDS’ critique and suggested reforms **\(PUB1, 2\)**, the new framework developed since 2016 represented a substantial change beyond the UK Government’s *ad hoc*, bottom\-up, and deal\-by\-deal approach towards greater clarity in the rationale, aims, monitoring, and evaluation of devolution policy. CURDS’ role in this policy change is further evidenced by the UK Government’s adoption of the language of a decentralisation *“roadmap”* in 2020 – a central recommendation of CURDS’ research – by the Minister for Regional Growth and Local Government **\(IMP2\)**. The Area Director of the UK Cities and Local Growth Unit responsible for local growth and devolution in England acknowledged *“the significant impacts”* of CURDS’ research helped *“to strengthen and improve the evidence\-base and robustness of the rationales for devolution and local growth policy”* and *“provided the arguments and rationales which have shaped thinking…in formulating the UK Government’s Devolution White Paper”* **\(IMP3\)**. This evidence demonstrates the reach and significance of CURDS’ research in shaping this ‘road map’ which will be published as the UK Government’s forthcoming Devolution White Paper for England \(planned publication 2021 – see Mitigation Statement\). CURDS’ research has substantially influenced other high\-profile initiatives shaping national government policy for subnational economic development and decentralisation. In 2019, CURDS was invited by the Chair of the UK2070 Commission’s independent national inquiry into city and regional inequalities in the UK to provide evidence to inform its proposals for devolution in England. They acknowledged the *“substantive impacts”* of CURDS’ research **\(PUB4\)** in forming its *“arguments, discussions and representations to the UK Government in framing the forthcoming White Paper for a clearer road\-map for a structured and systematic approach to devolution in England*” to progress the UK Government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda to reduce spatial economic inequalities **\(IMP4\)**. 

1.  <ins>Strengthened subnational</ins> <ins> **governance**</ins> <ins>by clarifying the purpose and roles of Local Enterprise Partnerships in England and enhancing their accountability and performance monitoring</ins> 

 On the basis of his *“expertise in the area of English devolution”*, Pike was invited to be an Expert Panel Member for the National Audit Office’s \(NAO\) 2016 LEP study scrutinising public spending for the UK Parliament “ *to advise and challenge our work from early conceptual design, to emerging findings and finally draft report*” **\(IMP5\)**. This significant impact is evidenced in the NAO’s 2016 report. It uses issues identified by CURDS’ research in its analysis and recommendations, specifically: assessing the role of LEPs in tackling spatial economic inequalities; strengthening their evaluation; reducing their dependence upon local government; increasing their resources; and enhancing their accountability and transparency **\(IMP6\)**. Pike’s contributions led to his invitation to provide oral evidence to the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts’ 2016 inquiry scrutinising value for money in national cities and local growth policy. His inputs directly informed 6 of the final report’s 9 recommendations **\(IMP7a\)** that were supported and implemented by the UK Government in strengthening its LEP National Assurance Framework **\(IMP7b\)**. Pike was then engaged by the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), responsible for ensuring the economy works for people and places across the UK, to advise on their 2018 review of LEPs. Directly taking up key findings from CURDS’ pathbreaking national research, BEIS’ policy changed to clarify LEPs’ purpose and role, streamline their geographies, strengthen their accountability, governance and performance monitoring, and support their capacity building. As a result of these changes, the NAO’s later 2019 study concluded BEIS had improved LEP governance but needed to strengthen further their accountability. The Head of Local Growth Analysis in BEIS acknowledged the impact of CURDS’ *“longstanding research expertise”*, *“noteworthy contribution”* and *“valuable insights”* on subnational economic development and devolution policy informing the review and policy change **\(IMP8\)**. Putting CURDS’ research into practice to generate wider benefits for LEPs across England, Kempton’s 2019 work directly impacted Greater Lincolnshire LEP’s \(GLLEP\) strategy making it “ *more innovative and more inclusive” to “ensure our strategy will impact on and benefit a wider range of citizens and businesses*” **\(IMP9\)**. 

1.  <ins>Upgraded</ins> <ins> **design and delivery**</ins> <ins>of strategies, policies and</ins> <ins>evaluations by</ins> <ins>assessing</ins> <ins>City and Regional Growth Deals in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland</ins> 

 In England since 2013, CURDS’ pioneering City Deals research directly impacted on the development of the UK Government’s approach to Devolution, City and Regional Growth Deals devolving powers and resources to increase economic development and reduce spatial economic inequalities. Resulting from CURDS’ research, the new deals were upgraded to incorporate clearer strategy and stronger appraisal, monitoring, and evaluation frameworks to improve their delivery and effectiveness. The reach and significance of CURDS’ research impacts extended beyond England to strengthen independent appraisal and evaluation in the deals introduced by the UK and devolved governments since 2014 **\(IMP10a\)**. From 44 written responses, O’Brien was selected to provide oral evidence to the Scottish Parliament Local Government and Communities Committee which was cited and used in the final report recommendations **\(IMP10b\)**. As a direct and substantive impact, the deal evaluation frameworks were changed to monitor and assess the potential displacement effects of deals in diverting economic growth and/or job creation between deal and non\-deal areas **\(IMP10b\)**. This change ensured the deals were better focused on maximising their economic development impact and value for public money. In Wales from 2015, CURDS’ research improved the design, development, and implementation of new City and Regional Growth Deals in Cardiff, Swansea and North Wales – covering 3,000,000 people and economies of GBP60,000,000,000 – by providing clearer and stronger rationales for their strengthened accountability, scrutiny, monitoring, and evaluation arrangements **\(IMP11a\)**. The Wales TUC \(Trade Union Congress\), representing 48 unions and over 400,000 workers in Wales, confirmed that CURDS’ research ensured that such deal\-making was *“better understood by decision makers, particularly in local government”* **\(IMP11b\)**. In Northern Ireland from 2019, CURDS’ research helped the design and implementation of two new City Region Deals in Belfast and Derry City and Strabane, covering populations of 1,300,000 and economies of GBP30,000,000,000. Of the 106 participants from the public, private and civic sectors in a workshop on ‘Learning from City Deals’ in Belfast in 2019 organised by CURDS, UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government \(MHCLG\) and Belfast City Region Deal, a substantial majority committed to changes to improve their focus, formalise governance structures, and leverage private sector investment **\(IMP12a\)**. The UK Cities and Local Growth Unit Deputy Director acknowledged *“the fresh perspectives”* from CURDS’ research had *“positively supported the agenda and shaped thinking, in particular in regard to appraisal of business cases, monitoring and evaluation”* and helped *“equip the local partners with the best knowledge and tools to deliver city and growth deals that will transform their regions”* **\(IMP12b\)**. The Belfast City Region Deal Programme Director stated that the impact of CURDS’ research was *“the confidence it gave us to have a city deal that was transformative”* **\(IMP12c\)**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Lydgate’s work, underpinned by her research expertise in trade and environmental policy, led the UK Government to change pesticides legislation to ensure the continued protection of human and animal health from endocrine disrupting chemicals, and formed an evidence base for stronger Parliamentary scrutiny of food standards in UK trade negotiations. It also shaped EU negotiating positions toward the UK on environmental protection through ‘level playing field’ commitments, and helped to influence Labour Party positions toward a closer relationship with the EU post\-Brexit. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Dr Lydgate is a Senior Lecturer in Law at Sussex, and Deputy Director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory \(UKTPO\), an interdisciplinary research centre that aims to inform UK trade policy. Domestic and international law are often academically siloed, and Lydgate’s research is unusual for drawing from in\-depth understanding of both EU/UK domestic environmental law and international trade rules. Her research examines the way that trade integration influences national environmental regulation. She has argued that environmental regulation responds to complex, scientifically\-uncertain problems, which challenges the often instrumentalist logic of international trade treaties and tribunals \[R1, R3\]. Lydgate’s research has also brought new insight into the ways in which the UK Government navigates between competing pressures to liberalise trade and erect regulatory trade barriers that pursue environmental objectives \[R5\]. 

 Since the referendum on membership of the EU in June 2016, Lydgate has focused on examining the relationship between UK trade and environmental objectives. This problem had immediate pragmatic implications: the UK Government’s Brexit timetable was much shorter than that of the typical research project. Lydgate’s ability to scrutinise and inform policy developments derived from the application of existing research expertise to the new circumstances, getting results out quickly and in an accessible way. 

 More specifically, the UK has historically derived the vast majority of its environmental regulation from the EU. Thus, post\-Brexit, crucial questions have arisen that Lydgate’s research has addressed. One such question is how new UK environmental regulation will impact upon trade. Lydgate’s analysis \[R4\] revealed that the UK’s post\-Brexit food safety rules fell short of the level of protection currently provided by the EU and provided a relatively clear path for a UK Prime Minister to overcome Parliamentary opposition to new trade agreements covering food products. It uncovered consequences that led directly to a legislative change, as documented below. 

 A second key question is how the EU and UK will manage future environmental cooperation through a trade agreement. Whilst unwinding their current high level of legislative alignment, they must develop and agree environmental commitments in their future trade relationship. Publication \[R3\] was co\-produced in discussion with the European Policy Centre and EU Commission Task Force 50 \(Brexit\) negotiators, who sought Lydgate’s advice on how to shape environmental commitments in their future trade agreement with the UK. In the paper, drawing from previous research expertise \[R1\] on how trade agreements interact with domestic environmental protection in the EU context, Lydgate recommended that environmental non\-regression would be most effectively achieved by emphasising UK domestic environmental enforcement alongside attempting to calibrate a common level of protection. 

 Lydgate also co\-authored \[R2\] with UKTPO economist Professor L. Alan Winters, which analysed the legal and economic dimensions of replicating conditions of the EU Customs Union post\-Brexit on a sectoral rather than economy\-wide basis. It concluded that such solutions would be highly complex to administer and provide less legal certainty. EU and UK negotiating positions reveal that the degree of market integration between the EU and UK determines the level of environmental cooperation, confirming that the concerns and findings of her other work are also applicable in this domain.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Changing UK pesticides legislation** 

 Dr Lydgate’s analysis, underpinned by research expertise developed in \[R4\], led directly to a change in UK pesticides legislation. The research was used by two NGOs in 2019, Chemtrust and the Public Law Project, in separate legal challenges against the UK Government: a pre\-action protocol for Judicial Review and a High Court case appealed to the Supreme Court. 

 Lydgate’s research, which received wide media attention \[S1\], uncovered that the UK Government had omitted EU restrictions on Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals. Inspired by this analysis, and after liaising with Lydgate, the NGO Chemtrust partnered with the Law firm Leigh Day to initiate legal action against then Environment Minister, Michael Gove, regarding this omission \[S2.1\]. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\) confirmed that: 

 ‘On 16 May 2019, Defra officials became aware of the issue after being alerted by HSE \[Health and Safety Executive\] to an online news article alleging that controls on endocrine disrupting chemicals would be removed by EU exit legislation. This article was based on work by the University of Sussex’s UK Trade Policy Observatory. Officials immediately initiated action to address this issue by including a correcting provision within the forthcoming Pesticides \(Amendment\) \(EU Exit\) Regulations 2019.’ \[S2.2\] 

 The news article to which DEFRA refers is a blog titled ‘Not Just a Technical Exercise: a look at new pesticides regulation’, published by Lydgate and her team on the UKTPO website on 15 May 2019; this blog was based on research developed in \[R4\]. In Parliamentary debate on 1 October 2019, Shadow Minister Sandy Martin made clear the harm that could have been caused by this omission: 

 ‘...if it were not for this correction in this SI \[Statutory Instrument\], we would not have been able to prohibit the approval of active substances, safeners and synergists which have endocrine disrupting properties. Endocrine disrupting chemicals have a significant effect on animal and human health.' \[S3\] 

 The omission had broader constitutional significance. Lydgate partnered with the Public Law Project \(PLP\) NGO in a UKTPO event at Chatham House in May 2019, where she presented the results of the pesticide research; it was subsequently included as evidence in the PLP submission to the High and Supreme court cases in which Miller successfully challenged the Government’s prorogation of Parliament in September 2019. The pesticides Statutory Instrument was directly cited as an example of poorly\-drafted secondary legislation and thus requiring scrutiny from Parliament \[S4\]. It was thereby used as an example to argue that prorogation would restrict scrutiny of remaining Statutory Instruments, to the detriment of the public interest. 

 The final judgement of the Supreme Court includes the PLP as an intervenor \(non\-party participant\) and relies upon its argument as a core reason for finding prorogation unlawful: ‘\[The memorandum recommending prorogation\] does not discuss the impact of prorogation on the special procedures for scrutinising the delegated legislation necessary to make UK law ready for exit day.’ \[S5\] 

 **Strengthening Parliamentary oversight of post\-Brexit food standards** 

 Research undertaken in \[R4\] also helped to impel stronger Parliamentary scrutiny of how post\-Brexit UK trade agreements will shape UK food standards. In Parliamentary debate about the Agriculture Bill, Lord Burnett stated: 

 ‘I commend to the House an article dated 12 September 2019, written by Chloe Anthony, a lecturer in law at the University of Sussex, and Dr Emily Lydgate, a fellow of the UK Trade Policy Observatory … entitled UK food safety Statutory Instruments: A problem for US\-UK negotiations? Referring to the statutory instruments created under the European Union \(Withdrawal\) Act 2018, these authors argue that some provide extensive scope for Ministers to make future changes to food and safety legislation … We in this House and the other place are aware of the problems of overseeing secondary legislation and the power it gives to Governments. Much of the existing legislation on food safety, animal welfare and environmental standards can be altered by statutory instrument.’ \[S6.1\] 

 The article Lord Burnett referenced was a blog based on research undertaken in \[R4\], which argued that food standards statutory instruments undermined Parliamentary oversight over trade agreements – an approach that was fundamentally flawed and needed reform. To rectify this problem, the Lords proposed an amendment to the Agriculture Bill that addressed this concern directly by increasing Parliamentary oversight \[S6.2\]. Whilst HM Government rejected this amendment, they agreed a similar ‘amendment in lieu’ which now forms part of the 2020 Agriculture Act. It requires the Government to report directly to Parliament on whether UK Free Trade Agreements weaken food standards \[S6.3\]. Lydgate’s research, explicitly cited in Parliamentary debate, provided an evidence base to support the need to make this change. 

 **Guiding the formulation of EU environmental non\-regression policy** 

 When, in 2017, the EU Commission Task Force 50 \[Brexit\] negotiators began developing their strategy for the ‘level playing field’ – which would inform the EU’s approach to environmental non\-regression – they sought Lydgate’s expertise on trade agreements and environmental legislation. Although this is a standard component of EU Free Trade Agreements, the UK negotiation requires unwinding existing integration – a unique context. After a series of meetings with EU negotiators, Lydgate wrote a briefing paper for their internal review, followed by a version published by the European Policy Centre \[R3\]. 

 In both the unpublished version and in \[R3\], Lydgate put forth, and critically examined, the possibility of basing environmental non\-regression on calibrating a shared level of protection. This novel approach was adopted in the Withdrawal Agreement from November 2018. That Agreement was not accepted by UK Parliament, but it formed the basis for the EU’s position on environmental provisions in a UK\-EU FTA. In the final EU\-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement \(TCA\), it is incorporated through a novel mechanism which, in certain circumstances, allows either side to impose tariffs if they do not maintain a shared level of environmental protection \(TCA, Part 2, Title XI, Article 9.4\) \[S7\]. In a letter to Lydgate, \[text removed for publication\] \[S8\] 

 **Supporting Parliamentary scrutiny of UK trade policy** 

 Between July 2016 and December 2020, Lydgate contributed to 10 Parliamentary inquiries to 5 different Commons and Lords Select Committees through oral and written evidence – a sustained contribution to the capacity of Parliament to scrutinise trade policy \[S9\]. Among these, Lydgate’s research briefing \[R3\] prompted the House of Commons Exiting the EU Committee to invite Lydgate to give oral evidence. \[text removed for publication\] \[S10\] 

 Similarly, \[text removed for publication\] \[S11\] 

 \[text removed for publication\] \[S11\]. 

 **Influencing the Labour Party in its advocacy of a UK\-EU Customs Union** 

 Lydgate and Winters \[R2\] examined in detail the limitations of trying to replicate the benefits of the Customs Union through sectoral agreements, and examined the implications of a ‘sectoral’ approach, as well as a UK transitional arrangement, with respect to the rules of the World Trade Organisation. The analysis of this possibility was published in several UKTPO Briefing papers and blogs and underpinned UKTPO influence on the Labour Brexit position. Following several meetings with Lydgate and other UKTPO fellows, the Opposition stated in August 2017 that it would seek to remain in a customs union with the EU. In  [February 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/25/labour-backs-staying-in-eu-customs-union-keir-starmer-confirms), following further meetings, Labour argued for seeking a customs union in the long run. \[text removed for publication\] \[S12\]. 

 During spring 2019 the debate and cross\-party talks revolved almost entirely around Labour’s demand that the future trade arrangement with the EU include a customs union.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case\-study is about the decolonisation of historical knowledge in the age of Black Lives Matter. Specifically, it is about how research by Evans on the suppressed history of Wales and Atlantic slavery has been used to extend public understanding and affect the ways in which public bodies handle a difficult, contested past. The impact takes three principal forms: 

1.  supporting change in curatorial practice at the  [National Museum of Wales](https://museum.wales/), a family of seven museums dedicated to different aspects of the Welsh past and culture 

1.  improving the range and quality of information available to communities affected by the legacy of Atlantic slavery 

1.  informing the Welsh Government’s policy on the memorialisation of Atlantic slavery and British imperialism 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The case study draws upon pioneering research by Evans on the relationship between Atlantic slavery and industrial development in Europe, with a particular focus on Welsh industry, first reported upon in 2010 in *Slave Wales: The Welsh and Atlantic Slavery, 1660\-1850* \( **R1**\). This book revealed for the first time the significance of Welsh woollens in the slave Atlantic between the 1680s and the 1840s. These fabrics, known as 'Welsh Plains’, were used in the procurement and maintenance of enslaved workers. Using material in British and US archives, Evans was able to demonstrate how Welsh Plains were \(i\) traded for captives on the Guinea coast, and \(ii\), more importantly, sold in large volumes to planters in the Caribbean and North America. Here, marketed as “Negro Cloth”, Welsh Plains were used to clothe enslaved workers. This was reported in **R1** and **R3**. 

 This was a previously unsuspected finding, but it is of a piece with much recent research on the material functioning of the Atlantic slave complex. It dovetails with other scholarship that points to the profound effects that the provisioning needs of the plantation world \(its demand for food, fuel, packaging, processing equipment, etc.\) had on parts of the world that were, on a superficial view, detached from Atlantic slavery. Evans’ research therefore reinforces the claim that mass enslavement in the New World was in no way aberrant in an age of gathering modernity \(conventionally characterized as a contractual, free\-labour phenomenon\). On the contrary, enslavement *was an expression of emergent modernity*. 

 This is also research that intersects with a generation’s worth of scholarship that sees the manufacturing and trading of textiles as powering global integration in the early modern era. Evans’ work offers a way of linking the history of Welsh rural industry, a story traditionally told in the most insular of ways, into an expansive global narrative. It runs in parallel with the work Evans has conducted on the Welsh copper industry of the eighteenth century, which, by supplying sugar processing and distilling equipment, also had vital links to the plantation world. 

 Evans continues to contribute to this field of scholarship, both through publication \(see **R2**, **R4**, and **R5**\) and through the organisation of conferences, notably *Clothing the Enslaved in the Eighteenth\-Century Atlantic World*, hosted by the National Museum of Wales in 2019 with support from the Pasold Research Fund.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **USW research has supported change in curatorial practice at the National Museum of Wales.** In 2017, in an act of ‘decolonisation’, the National Museum launched a review of its social history collections. To quote the Principal Curator, Contemporary & Community History, ‘we began to critically address the absence of slavery in the interpretation at some of our industrial museum sites. To undertake this review, we were hugely reliant on Professor Evans’s published works and his on\-going research into Welsh plains’ \( **S1**\). 

 The use of Evans’ research was one aspect of an increasingly close relationship between the University of South Wales and the National Museum of Wales. The two signed a memorandum of understanding in 2018, responding to the  [Well\-being of Future Generations Act Wales](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2015/2/introduction/enacted) \(2015\), which requires public bodies in Wales to consciously counteract persistent inequities in wealth, health, and access to cultural resources. 

 Evans’ work on Wales and Atlantic slavery responds to that agenda by **improving** **the range and quality of information available to communities affected by the legacy of Atlantic slavery.** It serves as a bridge between community activism and the articulation of new narratives of the Welsh past within the National Museum of Wales and other cultural institutions. Most notably, Evans’ book *Slave Wales* was the inspiration for a community research project,  [*From Sheep to Sugar: Welsh Wool and Slavery*](http://www.welshplains.cymru/), supported by the National Heritage Lottery Fund in 2019\-2020. The project was based in North and Mid\-Wales, the heartland of Negro Cloth production, and directed by Learning Links International, a social enterprise specialising in educational initiatives linking Wales to the Caribbean and Africa. One of the directors of Learning Links International offers this testimony \( **S2**\): 

 “This idea was based by the challenge made by Professor Chris Evans in his book *Slave Wales*… that ‘The mostly mute landscape must be made to speak’… The Learning Links International team approached Prof. Evans to ask for his support as we took up the challenge and prepared an application for funding… The support of Prof. Chris Evans was therefore fundamentally important as we embarked on explaining this history in context.” 

 Evans introduced the project at a launch event in Shrewsbury in May 2019, the historic conduit between rural weavers in mid\-Wales and international markets. Community research groups were subsequently established in Bangor, Machynlleth, Dolgellau, Glyn Ceiriog, and Shrewsbury. Fifty\-seven volunteers were recruited to conduct research on Negro Cloth and to disseminate knowledge of this overlooked Welsh product. The project’s volunteers were all trained using Evans’ *Slave Wales* as a set text. Evans also undertook two tours in Mid\- and North Wales in summer 2019 on behalf of Learning Links International, meeting volunteer researchers, and liaising with the institutional stakeholders, such as the Jamaica Wales Alliance, Race Council Cymru, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, and Shropshire Archives, which have supported the volunteers in their work. Evans’ role in *From Sheep to Sugar* was highlighted in the project’s final report to the National Heritage Lottery Fund \(ref. OH\-18\-03009\), and the project has been recognised as an exemplary response to the Well\-Being of Future Generations Act by the Learned Society of Wales, the national academy for arts and sciences, in its 2020 report  [*Wales Studies: Research about Wales, for Wales and the World*](https://www.learnedsociety.wales/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wales-Studies-ENG-FINAL-low-res.pdf), p. 13\) \( **S3**\). 

 There have been direct cultural outcomes. The award\-winning Welsh\-language writer  [Angharad Tomos](https://www.ylolfa.com/authors/48/angharad-tomos), who attended one of the *From Sheep to Sugar* public events, was inspired to write a Young Adult novel, *Y Castell Siwgr* \[The Sugar Castle\] \(2020\), which explores the links between Wales and Jamaica through its two teenage protagonists, one free and one enslaved \( **S4**\). 

 “I was going to write a novel about \[Jamaican plantation owner\] Lord Penrhyn. Then I heard your talk in Llanberis Slate Museum about the Negro Cloth/ Welsh flannel \- which was new to me \- so I decided to write about two young girls \- 15 year olds, \- Dorcas is from a weaving family in Dolgellau \- who goes to work as a maid in Penrhyn Castle and the other one is Ebony, an enslaved girl in Jamaica… thanks for the inspiration… it was very important for me to know that. Instead of blaming 'the other' for slavery…it made me realise how intricate the pattern is” 

 Tomos also acknowledge the importance of Evans’ work in  [promotional material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egfxVJjh5v8&t=21s) for *Y Castell Siwgr* \(in Welsh\). 

 Evans has also been able to engage with contemporary craft practitioners who have participated in the *From Sheep to Sugar* project. *From Sheep to Sugar* inspired several contemporary practitioners, recruited via weavers’, spinners’, and dyers’ guilds in Wales and the West of England, to imaginatively recreate Negro Cloth. One textile artist, Jennifer Hodgeman, having read Evans’ *Slave Wales*, designed a textile installation, “Sugar\(sic\)k”, which was exhibited at The Weir Garden, a National Trust property in Herefordshire that attracts 35,000 visitors annually, in 2019 \( **S5**\). 

 Further artistic collaborations, scheduled for 2020, are now in abeyance because of Covid\-19. 

-  Text by Evans was to have been incorporated into an installation by  [Barbara Prezeau Stephenson](https://prezeau-stephenson.com/), the internationally acclaimed Haitian visual artist and cultural activist, at the BayArt Gallery, Cardiff \( **S6**\). 

-  The history of Negro Cloth was also to have featured in the exhibition *Brethyn \(Cloth\)* at The Turner Art Gallery \(a wing of the National Museum of Wales\), Penarth \( **S7**\). 

-  Emily Laurens, co\-director of Feral Theatre, is using the  [Egin Residency](https://www.nationaltheatrewales.org/people/emily-laurens/) awarded her by National Theatre Wales to develop a theatre piece that explores the links between Welsh textiles, the use of coerced labour in the modern fashion industry, and ecological crisis \( **S8**\). 

 Cumulatively, this activity has allowed Evans to establish collaborative ties with key curatorial staff at the National Museum. During the winter of 2019\-2020 a research assistant working under Evans’ direction conducted a search of the National Museum’s collections database and archives catalogue for materials that bear upon the repressed history of Wales and Atlantic slavery. Her report was to have informed digital / pop\-up exhibitions that would, had Covid\-19 not intervened, have been made available to the National Museum site at St Fagans, which attracts an annual  [683,000](https://museum.wales/visitor-figures/cumulative-2019-20/) visitors, other outlets in Wales \(such as the Newtown Textile Museum\), and venues beyond Wales, such as the International Slavery Museum, Liverpool. 

 **The Welsh Government has recognised Evans’ expertise and appointed him to public roles as a result.** Evans is now acknowledged as a public authority on slavery, industry and landscape in Wales and more widely. This was signalled when, in the wake of Colston Must Fall in Bristol, the First Minister of Wales appointed him to an  [investigative commission](https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020-11/the-slave-trade-and-the-british-empire-an-audit-of-commemoration-in-wales.pdf) tasked with auditing public monuments, street and building names in Wales associated with Atlantic slavery. The audit was published in November 2020. It was welcomed by the First Minister with these words: 

 “Under the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, we have a duty to work towards a Wales which is more equal. To help us do this, we need a clear\-eyed understanding of the legacies of the slave trade and the British Empire. This audit provides an important evidence base, which will help us to establish an honest and more informed relationship with our history.” \( **S9**\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Understanding how conscious and unconscious attitudes underpin subsequent behaviours 

 towards racial and cultural outgroups is of primary importance in modern society. The research in this case study has been utilised to increase awareness, suggest legislative and behavioural changes, and promote greater community understanding in how we tackle issues of prejudice in society. Dissemination of information to public audiences, and providing evidence bases to government and charity initiatives to reduce prejudice and improve the lives of refugees, asylum seekers and stigmatised outgroups have formed an ongoing impact of the research across Wales. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Project ImpEx \(a portmanteau of implicit and explicit prejudice\) was first developed in 2016 to build upon the existing research expertise of Dr Paul Hutchings exploring the interaction between implicit and explicit prejudice \(e.g., Hutchings & Haddock, 2008\) **\[i\]**. This programme of research underpinned the development of the WTSF’s Social, Group, and Political Psychology research group, including postgraduate researchers and other academic researchers in the fields of social and political psychology.  The specific aims of Project ImpEx, led by Hutchings, has two primary aims: firstly to carry out timely and responsive research into the prevalence of implicit and explicit prejudice across different groups within society, how it influences people in their interactions and behaviours in contemporary society, and whether these prejudices can be reduced; and secondly to disseminate these findings to a public audience and to engage with agencies within society who may benefit in their practice from increased knowledge and awareness. 

 Building upon the extant literature of others, research carried out under Project ImpEX has furthered our understanding of the role that individual differences in implicit and explicit prejudice play in the attitudes and behavioural responses to critical real\-world issues directly relevant to UK society. For example, Hutchings and Sullivan \(2019\) **\[ii\]**, and Sullivan and Hutchings \(2018\) **\[iii\]** have identified patterns of voting behaviour in the 2016 EU Referendum that link prejudice type categorisation to decisions to vote leave or remain in that referendum. The research also shows that prejudice type categorisations based upon implicit and explicit measurement \(e.g., egalitarianism, aversive racism, principled conservatism and modern racism\) is linked to patterns of attitudes towards legal and illegal migration and access to common societal resources. These findings suggest that attitudes towards migrants, both in terms of legal economic migratory behaviour, seeking sanctuary through refugee status, and illegal migration, are influenced by people’s prejudice types and may have profound societal impacts on the ways that migrants are treated within society. Expansion of this research into examination of the influence on prejudicial 

 attitudes of terrorist attacks by outgroup members has also shown that this may impact upon group cohesion and treatment within society \(Sullivan & Hutchings, 2020\) **\[iv\].** 

 Overall, this condensed period of research activity, being situationally responsive to highly sensitive real world issues being experienced in society during this time, has shown that people’s prejudices, at an implicit and explicit level, influence their interactions and attitudes to real\-world events that are occurring across our nation. This has provided the research team with a strong evidence base that has been used to underpin subsequent impact activities, alongside publication of the findings in peer\-reviewed journals. By applying the findings from their own research, alongside the research of others and the theoretical methodologies and explanations from a dynamic and well\-established scientific field, Project ImpEx has sought to inform and impact upon current events within society with an empirical, evidence\-based approach within Wales.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Alongside academic talks and research papers, the Project ImpEx team have actively engaged in a range of public engagement and awareness raising initiatives with the British Psychological Society, Welsh Government, Education leaders, Public Services, and a number of other groups associated with campaigning for practical change in society, including Race Council Cymru \(RCC\) and 4TheRegion. 

 **Public Engagement** 

 In 2015 Dr Hutchings became the first psychologist in Wales to give a TedX talk, discussing issues of implicit and explicit prejudice and their affect upon diversity \[2\]. This was followed in 2016 with an invitation from the British Psychological Society \(BPS\) to deliver the Ernest Jones Celebration Lecture, the highest profile public lecture in Wales run by the BPS \[3\]. In both cases the explanation of implicit and explicit prejudice and how they impact upon people’s behaviours towards others was delivered to large and diverse public audiences \(100\+\). From these initial engagement events a key relationship with Race Council Cymru was formed \(discussed further below\) \[1\]. In 2018 Hutchings and Sullivan were invited to contribute to events across Wales celebrating Black History Month 2018, where they discussed implicit and explicit prejudice in forum events with the general public and civic leaders. The dissemination, discussion and awareness raising at these events culminated in Hutchings and Sullivan being invited to give keynote addresses at the two Race Equality Conferences in 2018, one in Swansea and the other at the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff, with both attended by around 200 delegates, including members of community groups, local council members, and Welsh Government ministers \[4\].  In 2020 Dr Hutchings was invited to contribute to the United Nations Annual Psychology Day, which focused this year on migration across borders. This contribution was produced as a freely 

 available podcast via the UWTSD ‘Perspectives’ Education initiative \[5\] and was also produced as a full\-page article in the South Wales Evening Post to a readership of over 13,000 people \[6\]. 

 **Work with Race Council Cymru and 4TheRegion** 

 As a consequence of our research, for the last three years \(2017\-2020\) the Project ImpEx team have worked closely with Race Council Cymru \(RCC\) \[1\], the umbrella organisation that brings together communities, governing bodies, and local authorities to promote integration and equality in Wales.  Statistics show 73% of hate crimes and incidents in Wales relate to race and/or religion, meaning BAME and minority faith communities are disproportionately affected with often devastating impacts on victims, their families and the wider community. The Home Office 2018/2019 Hate Crime Statistics for England and Wales show a 17% increase in recorded hate crimes across Wales compared to 2017/2018. This compares to an overall 10% increase across the whole of England and Wales. There were 3,932 recorded hate crimes across the four Welsh Police Force Areas of which: 2,676 \(68%\) were race hate crimes and 206 \(5%\) were religion hate crimes. As announced by Jane Hutt AM, Deputy Minister and Chief Whip, the statistics illustrate the need for concerted effort on the part of public authorities, including the Welsh Government, to counter negative perceptions of minority communities, tackle hate crime where it occurs, and support victims. 

 Since 2017 we have worked alongside Race Council Cymru to help inform policy makers of the need to address this continued, rising and prevalent social problem in the Welsh national context. Additional work in this area has been progressed in collaboration with *4TheRegion*, an organisation that represents community groups and businesses in the South West Wales region with an aim of making positive changes in Welsh communities. Through our work with RCC and 4TheRegion the research team has carried out four workshop engagements across the country, in North and South Wales, delivering awareness\-raising workshops and CPD training to over 100 attendees including charity and community workers, local government officials, police officers and PCSOs. This was based on the underpinning research on implicit and explicit prejudice and the impacts upon people’s perceptions of racial and religious outgroups, immigration, and terrorism \(e.g., Hutchings & Sullivan, 2019; Sullivan & Hutchings, 2020\). For example, in North Wales our workshop brought together representatives from all of the above organisations to discuss how police, local authorities, and community support workers could identify evidence\-based intervention strategies within their local community to reduce prejudice and discrimination by recognising different types of prejudice relating to asylum seekers and refugees \[7\].  Feedback from these workshops indicated that these educational workshops had stimulated a greater understanding not only of the issues facing asylum seekers and refuges but of potential mechanisms to tackle this problem. 

 In 2019 the Project ImpEx team supported Race Council Cymru in providing empirical evidence relating to the impact of prejudice and discrimination in Wales, particularly in regard to hate crime and targeting of asylum seekers and refugees, in order to support a successful bid for funding from Welsh Government to establish community support in the South Wales area under the Hate Crime Minority Communities Scheme \[8\].  The Hate Crime project started on the 1st December 2019 and is a two\-year project funded by Welsh Government’s Hate Crime Minority Communities Grant scheme working in partnership with Victim Support Cymru and Hate Crime Officers within South Wales Police and Dyfed Powys Police forces. The hate Crime community support officer for South and West Wales covers Bridgend, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and parts of Powys County Boroughs, and also works alongside a number of Primary Schools across the area delivering a workshop around Unity and hate crime with year 5 or year 6 pupils.  The research data we were able to provide has helped to inform initiatives within this project in relation to educating and supporting ethnic minority groups, religious organisations and individuals across South and West Wales around hate crime, how to recognise it, report it and speak up for others who are victims of hate crime and will support the engagement of Community champions who will work as a local contact within their communities. 

 The project team continues to collaborate with RCC and other community groups through workshops and other evidence\-based initiatives through 2020 and beyond, and is currently working with RCC to consider ways of delivering events and research support under Covid\-19\-related restrictions. This includes evaluating the success of the project after its first year of service in order to seek additional funding for this service in the future from Welsh Government. 

 **Informing Discourse and Policy on Refugees and Asylum Seekers** 

 The National Assembly for Wales is the democratically elected body that represents the interests of Wales and its people, makes laws for Wales, agrees Welsh taxes and holds the Welsh Government to account.  While asylum policy is the responsibility of the UK Government, and thus was outside the remit of the Committee, the experience of refugees and asylum seekers in Wales, and the degree to which they are able to settle and pay a full part in Welsh communities, depends largely upon the accessibility and quality of the devolved services for which the Welsh Government is responsible. Based upon the above public engagement, research, and role within the British Psychological Society \(BPS\) Dr Hutchings, as Chair of the Welsh Branch of the British Psychological Society was asked in 2016 to lead the BPS response to The National Assembly for Wales \(Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee\) inquiry into refugees and asylum seekers in Wales \[9\].     The terms of reference for the inquiry were to consider: **a\)** the pace and effectiveness of the Welsh Government approach to resettling refugees through the UK Government’s Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Programme \(SVPRP\); **b\)** the effectiveness of the Refugee and Asylum Seeker Delivery Plan; **c\)** the support and advocacy available to unaccompanied asylum seeking children in Wales; and **d\)** the role and effectiveness of the Welsh Government’s Community Cohesion Delivery Plan in ensuring the integration of refugees and asylum seekers in Welsh communities. This is in a context where the world is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. In 2015, one in every 113 humans was either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum. In 2016, with an intensifying conflict in Syria and huge uncertainty across countries in the region, there were more displaced people in the world than at any other time in our history. By the end of 2016, Wales had provided sanctuary to 397 Syrian refugees, and nearly 3,000 asylum seekers of other nationalities \(including some Syrians\) were awaiting the outcome of their applications while living in Wales – mainly in Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Wrexham. The number of refugees settled in Wales is not known, but estimated to be between 6,000 and 10,000. 

 From the written response to the initial inquiry paper, led by Dr Hutchings and recorded as RAS 03 in the National Assembly for Wales document, the BPS were invited to present oral evidence to the Welsh Government \(carried out by Professor Bill Yule of UCL\) and a number of recommendations made by Dr Hutchings and other psychology colleagues were accepted in principle by the Welsh Government \[10\]. These included: 

-  **Recommendation 16**. The Welsh Government should establish a Guardianship service for Wales, supported by peer networks, as part of reaffirming Wales’ commitment to welcome unaccompanied asylum seeking children. 

-  **Recommendation 17.** The Welsh Government should ensure that there is a designated and suitably trained person in each local authority to undertake age assessments of asylum\-seeking children. 

-  **Recommendation 18.** The Welsh Government should ensure minimum standards of mental health support for unaccompanied asylum\-seeking children with trauma, in line with the British Psychological Society’s recommendations. 

 Whilst the impact of Covid19 restrictions over the last 12 months has hindered some of the ongoing impact initiatives such as the work with RCC on the hate crime project and engagement with civic leaders and politicians regarding the impact of prejudiced attitudes on attitudes towards racial and cultural outgroups, we remain committed to the project aims of disseminating empirically based research evidence and supporting initiatives across Wales based upon the empirical evidence.

 Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The constituent\-led and engaged approach to curatorial practice devised and implemented at Teesside University’s Middlesbrough Museum of Modern Art has stimulated sector discussion on the role of museums and galleries \(Arts Council England, Wellcome Collection\); shaped the curatorial practice of museums and galleries \(Galleria Moderna\) and enhanced cultural engagement and understanding with a diverse range of regional audiences through the design and development of exhibitions and events held at the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art on topics of importance to local audiences such as migration, regional industry, and the natural world, evoking resonant links between past, present and future through 57 exhibitions and 407 events.

 Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2014, researchers at the Centre for Creativity and Culture have undertaken curatorial research on the role of museums and galleries, developing and refining the concept of a “useful” and constituent\-engaged museum that is driven by regional approaches to, and understandings of, creativity, heritage, and place. Merging curatorial theory with curatorial practice, the research team have tested, embedded and shared their research through Teesside University’s Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art \(MIMA\). 

 Research\-led exhibitions at MIMA, such as <ins>Localism</ins> \(2015\), <ins>If All Relations Were To Reach Equilibrium This Building Would Dissolve</ins> \(2016\), <ins>This is Water</ins> \(2018\), and <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> \(2019\) have each sought to shift curatorial focus away from traditional and metropolitan notions of judgement, taste and legitimacy towards a self\-conscious, museum\-led ambition to “dig where we stand” \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]. The research of Hudson, Morgan, Amado and Stewart places engagement and education at the centre of their curatorial approach. Their research abandons the approach that emerged in the 1980s, still with us today, that sees arts initiatives as yoked to ‘enterprise’, new lifestyles and property regeneration across northern cities. This is a particularly provocative approach that unsettles widely held notions of regeneration, public engagement, and community work. 

 Taking forward the concept for Arte Útil developed by Argentine artist Eduardo Costa, <ins>Localism</ins> \(Hudson and Morgan\) interrogates the idea of the “useful museum” \[3.1\]. Taking a deliberately ‘localist’ approach to curation and working in partnership with regional communities to shape the exhibition, <ins>Localism</ins> enabled Tees Valley communities to reclaim the museum space. A ‘family tree’ of creativity on Teesside was established through the gathering of artefacts and artworks, and displays were regularly updated based on public feedback and contributions. A forum for public meetings, debates and conversations which were prompted by the exhibition was also provided. Some of the topics Localism addressed included Christopher Dresser and the Linthorpe Pottery, bridge building, the Boosbeck Industries in the 1930s and the existence of mima itself. Local artists were supported to set up workshops teaching skills such as furniture design, weaving and pottery making, skills linked to local heritage and the ‘forgotten’ trades of the region. 

 The exhibition <ins>If All Relationships Were to Reach Equilibrium, Then This Building Would Dissolve</ins> \(Amado\) builds on the ideas developed in Localism and explores the subject of migration on Teesside and elsewhere \[3.2\]. The exhibition brought together documents, artefacts and artworks made by Middlesbrough\-based asylum seekers and refugees as well as British and international artists. Working in collaboration with charities that work with Middlesbrough\-based asylum seekers and refugees, the exhibition went beyond awareness raising and formed part of an ongoing process of relationship building with local communities and organisations with the region. A key element of the exhibition and development of the format devised in <ins>Localism</ins> was the use of parts of the gallery as a centre for service provision, learning and debate. Free resources include a suite of computers with Internet access, a food bank, workshops, readings, film club, and awareness\-raising sessions, as well as activities for making and convening such as a communal weekly lunch, art classes and ESOL \(English to speakers of other languages\) courses. 

 Furthering this work, the exhibition <ins>This is Water</ins> \(Morgan\) explored the long histories of migration that have forged the current shape of the UK \[3.3\]. As a town founded on the rapid immigration of workers in the nineteenth century, Middlesbrough provided fertile ground for exploring the commonalities and shared experiences of immigration as well as changing identities and perceptions. By working with a formalised group of constituent advisers, the exhibition brought together art, personal memorabilia, and archival documents as well as materials from the North East Film Archives to give a nuanced portrait of the region’s migration histories. During the exhibition, a repository of the stories and voices from the Tees Valley was collated, creating an archive of marginalised voices highlighting the complex identities that form the Tees Valley region and transforming the nature of what constitutes a museum object. 

 In <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> \(Morgan\), global and regional perspectives are brought into dialogue through an exhibition focused on the exploitation of resources, trade networks and production of waste within the socio\-economic and ecological context of the Tees Valley \[3.4\]. The exhibition drew on 3 years of intensive research that foregrounded public dialogue between artists and ecology experts. Building on the idea of going beyond the exhibition, <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> consisted of a series of events and activities that took place across a whole year. The exhibition was used as a starting point to interrogate relationships between plants, animals and humans at a time of climate crisis and involved the work of 22 artists. This approach was combined with consultation with community groups through Design Thinking workshops and supplemented by interviews with international artists and curators. The result was a curatorial and community interrogation of colonial infrastructures, discourses in agriculture, botany, archaeology, as well as ecological conservation and technological determinism. 

 These exhibitions have been underpinned by theoretical and empirical research on curatorial theory and practice. <ins>The Constituent Museum</ins> \(Morgan\) examines the relationship between audience, expert and institution through an array of theoretical essays, case studies, and fictional writing. Morgan’s curatorial research informed the book’s conceptualisation \[3.5\]. Through sustained research spanning three years, Morgan edited texts, developed talks and staged a major conference, putting her research into dialogue with an international network of thinkers and influencing subsequent theory and practice. International contributors span specialisms in philosophy, education, social theory, art history and theory. 

 Work on art, critical pedagogy and capitalism \(Stewart\) has also furthered debates on both art and curatorial practice \[3.6\]. In this critical examination of art production, Stewart draws specific attention to the processes and context for art production. He argues that art practices with a social intent needs to involve a commitment to involvement to benefit those involved but not framed as participatory/participant through a critical understanding of the role of institutions, the contexts in which they operate, the bodies that occupy them, and the traditions, hierarchies and norms that influence how art and art institutions operate.

 Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art \(MIMA\) was incorporated into the University in 2014. It has provided the platform and mechanism for implementing this research into practice and for sharing practice\-led research. In 2015, Hudson wrote a 2015\-18 vision statement for MIMA that placed the idea of the “useful” museum at the heart of MIMA’s work. The aim was for MIMA to be ‘a place that is created and given meaning by the sum actions of all its users’ \[5.1\]. Through the exhibitions <ins>Localism</ins>, <ins>If All Relationships Were to Reach Equilibrium</ins>, <ins>This is Water</ins>, and <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> this ambition was tested, refined and realised, leading to MIMA’s 2019\-22 Business Plan that articulates MIMA’s renewed focus on “art in action” and a constituent\-engaged artistic programme \[5.1\]. Since 2015, MIMA has held 57 exhibitions and hosted 407 events. For context, MIMA receives 90,000 visitors a year. 

 Research\-led exhibitions and events exploring the idea of a “useful”, constituent\-led museum and held at MIMA have sought to provoke discussion on the role of museums, especially so in relation to community and place. MIMA’s work has led to representatives from both the Wellcome Collection and Museum of London visiting MIMA to learn more about their curatorial approach. For the Head of Engagement at the Museum of London, MIMA’s community board was particularly striking: ‘I was thinking about the community board and why it seems like such a radical thing to reach for – I’m glad to have it in my mind’s eye as an ambition to reach for’ \[5.2\]. According to the Acting Director of Moderna Galerija, Ljubljana, who led the EU New Mappings Project: ‘MIMA’s research into constituent\-led approaches to creating public forums for discourse with diverse communities was key to the development of the project…the network of organisations learnt from MIMA’s community programmes, including Community Day and the Cultural Conversations programme with new communities. Through discussions and workshops, we adapted these methodologies and approaches in each of our projects’ \[5.3\]. For a formal reviewer from Arts Council England, the <ins>Localism</ins> exhibition ‘was intended to be a provocative exercise, one designed to whip up debate about both what the function of the museum is and can be and, more specifically, what mima’s role might be in the specific geographical and economic landscape within which it is located \(and the challenges that come with that\). In that respect, it was extremely successful’. \[5.4\] 

 As a result of this constituent\-engaged approach to museum work, MIMA was included, in 2016, in the Calouste Gulbekian <ins>Foundation Inquiry into the Civic Role of Arts Organisations</ins>. MIMA was one of 80 international organisations to be featured in their case study bank that profiled best practice in civic engagement from around the world \[5.5\]. For the Director \(North\-North East\) of Arts Council England: ‘MIMA’s research\-informed approach to curatorial practice has led to a reinvention and challenging of the role of the museum, disrupting approaches within the sector. Seeing itself as a “useful museum”, MIMA seeks to influence society positively. For the Arts Council, this approach aligns well to our central mission of valuing the creativity of all, ensuring access to the arts and is one of the reasons for our continued investment in MIMA’ \[5.6\]. MIMA’s engaged approach was also cited by the Chair and Chief Executive \(Sir Peter Bazalgette and Darren Henley\) of Arts Council England in 2016 as part of the Countries of Culture inquiry, which launched in March to examine the wider cultural landscape. MIMA was selected as an example of the ‘growing contribution of universities, who want to make their local areas great places to work and study’ demonstrating the importance of MIMA’s work in rethinking not only the role of museums and galleries, but also the role Higher Education can play in community and civic engagement. This inquiry led to Arts Council shaping policies and approaches to building relationships with HEIs nationally. \[5.6, 5.7\]. 

 The exhibitions and their associated events \(talks, film club, lunches, and community days\) have also enhanced cultural engagement with modern art through a curatorial approach that centres the interests and needs of the local community. For the senior editor at FREIZE, a leading magazine of contemporary art and culture, MIMA provides a ‘powerful rejection of how the art world, too often, reduces activism to radical cosplay. This is an era in which political culture is being reformed in ways that may well be far more dramatic than what happened in the 1980s, and that’s the context in which mima proposes an articulation, rather than imposition, of a democratic cosmopolitanism, charting a progressive path out of here’ \[5.8\]. For a reviewer for Art Agenda, an online ‘publisher of rigorous and engaging writing on contemporary art’, the curatorial approach to <ins>Fragile Earth</ins> enabled news of engaging with and thinking about climate change and ‘provides a welcome example of how to make a meaningful, thoughtful, and deeply humane exhibition about the complex and emotionally charged issue of climate change in the twenty\-first century’ \[5.8\]. For a reviewer in the Gazette, Teesside’s local newspaper, <ins>If All Relations Were To Reach Equilibrium This Building Would</ins> spoke to the role museums can play in giving voice to marginalised communities: ‘For the many individuals fleeing Northern and Sub\-Saharan Africa, parts of the Middle East and other regions this is a huge platform to give a voice and an understanding to a plight; and the humanity behind these people forming a part of a multi\-cultured Teesside society’ \[5.8\]. This exhibition was subsequently featured on the Arts Council 2016/17 Annual Report as an example of an arts organisation ensuring ‘everyone has the opportunity to experience, and be inspired by, the arts, museums and libraries’. \[5.9\] 

 MIMA’s engaged approach has also contributed to the cultural offer of the Tees Valley, MIMA acting as an ‘important broker of sectoral discussion’. For the Creative Place Manager at Tees Valley Combined Authority: ‘Research undertaken by Teesside University researchers at the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art has made a significant contribution to our regional cultural offer, as well as local community engagement and cohesion. MIMA’s ethos as a museum owned and led by local communities drives positive change and the museum is a proactive hub where communities come together and reflect on ideas of place, culture, and identity. MIMA’s research\-informed outreach programme goes beyond the museum’s walls, working with schools, THIRTEEN Housing Group, and nursing homes to develop a deep and meaningful engagement on issues of migration, climate change and regional industry’ \[5.10\]. 

 MIMA’s role within the regional cultural economy of the Tees Valley is also seen through the continued investment and recognition of MIMA as a national portfolio organisation and for its important role within the North East \[5.6\]. Since 2014, Arts Council England have invested GBP4,086,056 in MIMA. More recently, an investment of GBP2,900,000 was made by Arts Council England’s Creative People and Places fund for a MIMA\-led Borderlands programme. The programme seeks to build cultural engagement in two areas of Teesside with extremely low levels of participation \[5.6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Innovative research at the University of Wolverhampton has been used to improve the quality of life of those from particular groups ‘at risk’ of digestive and eating disorders. Achievements include promoting the understanding of Inflammatory Bowel Disease \(IBD\) management in South Asian women, particularly during pre\-conception and pregnancy, through a pioneering art project ‘Living in Silence’. In addition, the research has resulted in improvements to how speech and language therapists’ \(SaLTs\) understand dysphagia in people with learning disabilities. This was achieved through substantial contributions to sector\-leading Public Health England \(PHE\) guidance documents. Further impacts relate to impacts relate to research on obesity, which has led to patient\-centred interventions for obesity and binge\-eating at Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust and City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Trust, as well as a succesul online intervention delivered to 1200 participtants. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Digestive and eating disorders are often considered a ‘taboo’ subject, which leads to widespread underdiagnosis and lack of treatment, causing poor quality of life and significant long\-term implications to health. For more than a decade, research at the University of Wolverhampton has focussed on a broad range of digestive/eating disorders and associated complications for particular ‘at risk’ groups, including dysphagia management in people with learning disabilities; the causes of food craving and obesity; and the psycho\-social impacts of IBD. This research has been enhanced in recent years through a new partnership with clinical gastroenterologists based at Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. The 5 findings \[F\] that have led to significant impacts are detailed below: 

 <ins>F1.</ins> <ins>Psychosocial effects of IBD on women’s reproductive health</ins> 

 IBD can cause substantial negative psychological issues, particularly during pregnancy. In the first comprehensive systematic review on the psychosocial effects of IBD on women’s reproductive health \[R1\], a range of important findings were discovered including: 

-  One‐fifth to one‐third of IBD patients choose voluntary childlessness, compared to a general population childlessness frequency of <10%, due to pregnancy\-related fears and concerns. 

-  Around one\-fifth of patients stop taking their medication during pregnancy in the belief that it may be associated with complications in pregnancy. 

-  There is a lack of understanding of IBD\-related issues amongst people from Black Asian Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) backgrounds. 

 The study highlighted the need to improve pre\-conception counselling with women as an effective tool for improving understanding of the risks of pregnancy for IBD patients. It indicated the potential to reduce the incidences of voluntary childlessness through improved information on the topic. 

 <ins>F2.</ins> <ins>UK IBD healthcare standards</ins> 

 In collaboration with IBD UK and other clinicians across the country, Brookes provided a substantial contribution to the development of the UK standards for healthcare of adults and children with IBD \[R2\]. The resulting 59 Standards covered domains such as “pre\-diagnostic referral pathways, protocols and timeframes” and “holistic care of the newly diagnosed patient”. The results of the project highlight the need for patient empowerment and personalised care to be central to IBD management \[R2\]. This study also led to the development of an IBD Service Benchmarking Tool that facilitates enhancement and quality improvement for healthcare services for all people with IBD and reduces inequalities in access and care for particular ‘at risk’ groups. 

 <ins>F</ins><ins>3</ins><ins>. Supporting the management of dysphagia in people with learning disabilities</ins> 

 Dysphagia is disproportionately common in people with learning disabilities and has a number of significant negative consequences for health and quality of life, including reduced self\-determination and choice around eating and drinking; reduced nutritional status; aspiration of food and drinks into the airway and lungs; and the potential for respiratory infections, asphyxia and death \[R3\]. In a study surveying 38 SaLTs, a number of barriers to safe dysphagia management were identified including beliefs, knowledge, and emotional responses held by carers towards management strategies which impeded their implementation \[R3\]. A further randomised control trial found that a training intervention to support the modification of fluids to a safe thickened consistency to facilitate oral transit of the bolus and enable safer swallowing was effective \[R4\]. 

 <ins>F</ins><ins>4</ins><ins>. Binge eating</ins> <ins>disorder</ins> <ins>in obese adults</ins> 

 Binge eating disorder is a relatively common eating disorder amongst obese individuals but is poorly understood. It can be a significant challenge for individuals, leading to higher rates of mental illness and poorer quality of life. A comprehensive literature review highlighted that depression was consistently associated with binge eating, with particular negative impacts including sadness, tension and instability of emotion \[R5\]. Resulting recommendations from the study facilitate more effective identification of binge eating disorder \[R5\]. 

 <ins>F</ins><ins>5. UK version of the Food Craving Inventory</ins> 

 Food cravings are a common occurrence particularly amongst dieters and those with eating disorders. In the UK just under 70% of non\-dieters report food cravings, rising to over 90% in those dieting. Such cravings are cited as a key reason for failure to lose weight when dieting and can often have a significant contribution to obesity problems. In 2013, Nicholls developed a UK version of the American ‘Food Craving Inventory’, a tool developed to self\-diagnose specific food cravings in individuals \[R6\]. The translation used 234 participants, to modify and validate the tool for use in UK settings \[R6\]. The resulting UK Food Craving Inventory is an effective tool for aiding clinical practice and accurately highlighting risk foods for those struggling with food cravings.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The novel and significant research in digestive/eating disorders and complications discussed above has led to a diverse and substantial range of impacts \[I\]. Our research led to enhanced public understanding of the disorders and their related treatment options. It also led to changes in professional practice. 

 <ins>I</ins><ins>1</ins><ins>. Improving</ins> <ins>public</ins> <ins>understanding of IBD through new artworks</ins> 

 The University of Wolverhampton is located amongst a sizeable South Asian community, with over 15% of the population of Wolverhampton identifying as Asian ethnicity. The research focussing on IBD and pregnancy \[F1\] and the potential for inequalities in IBD healthcare \[F2\] led to the initiation of the ‘Living in Silence’ project in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Wolverhampton’s School of Art and Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. Supported by funding from Arts Council England, the aim of “Living in Silence” was to destigmatise and improve understanding of chronic IBD in the South Asian female population in Wolverhampton and the surrounding area through unique and innovative works created by 5 artists. These included a sari with a pattern designed from a microscopic image of a diseased gut and a representation of a make\-up table of someone who suffers from IBD. 

 The exhibition of ‘Living in Silence’ ran from 16<sup>th</sup> September 2019 to 7<sup>th</sup> October 2019 at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, as well as a one\-day exhibition at the House of Lords on 18<sup>th</sup> July 2019. Counts at the hospital exhibition indicated over 1200 visitors, with many thousands further engaging on social media. The Director of Services, Policy & Evidence for Crohn’s and Colitis UK identified ‘Living in Silence’ as an important project informing their \#ItTakesGuts campaign and highlighted the importance of the project for changing perceptions, “particularly in the under\-served South Asian community” \[C1\]. Subsequently, Stuart Anderson MP, who attended the exhibition, commended the project and highlighted the importance of improving early diagnosis of digestive conditions \[C2\]. He also indicated the project helped him shape his key priorities in his role as an MP, specifically relating to the goal of “running campaigns that champion the health and wellbeing of my constitutions” \[C2\]. 

 <ins>I2. Informing health policy and professional practice</ins> <ins>around</ins> <ins>dysphagia in people with learning disabilities</ins> 

 The findings on managing dysphagia in people with intellectual disabilities \[F3\] were incorporated into a variety of PHE policy and guideline documents all published online in 2016 \[C3\]. Since their initial publication, these documents and Chadwick’s primary research have been widely used by practitioners and care workers in Trusts across the country to inform their interventions, training and direct support for people with dysphagia. In November 2020, a highly experienced SaLT, currently working at Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust, indicated her use of Chadwick’s work to inform her practice in the “care and support of over 200 individuals with intellectual disabilities” and was “aware of his work being used to train and inform the practice of many SaLTs in the UK and internationally” \[C4\]. The Clinical Lead for NHS Derbyshire Speech and Language Therapy indicated Chadwick’s research had directly benefited over 500 of her own patients, whilst also highlighting 35 to 40 SaLTs to whom she recommended his work \[C5\]. 

 As a testament to the importance of, and demand for, Chadwick’s work on this subject, in the first full month the resources were downloaded 97 times by various professionals \[C6\]. Of these 97, 70 identified as SaLTs, with comments such as “they have encouraged me to look at my practice and be more aware of the difficulties for persons with intellectual difficulties” and “research evidence helps me to understand where compromise might be made and which factors are most important” \[C6\]. The evidence presented highlights Chadwick’s work on dysphagia as a key resource for those working with dysphagia patients with intellectual disabilities, particularly SaLTs. 

 <ins>I3.</ins> <ins>Improving the lives of</ins> <ins>people</ins> <ins>with obesity</ins> 

 Through directly working with practitioners, a number of key impacts have been achieved, improving the quality of lives of those with obesity and binge eating disorder \[F4, F5\]. In 2015, a Tier 3 NHS weight management service was established at Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust. This service used the findings on binge eating disorder \[F4\] to develop interventions for 45 obese patients, particularly focusing on targeting the association between emotions and overeating. The trial lasted over 3 years, offering an improvement on standard treatment, through helping clients gain acceptance and control over their over\-eating \[C7\]. 

 Furthermore, using the research findings on binge eating \[F5\], in 2015 a novel patient information booklet was produced to benefit NHS patients with binge eating disorder, helping to investigate patients’ experiences of binge eating and the accompanying emotional aspects. The booklet was used at 2 NHS Trusts \(Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust & City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Trust\), where practitioners including psychologists and dieticians working in Tier 3 NHS weight management used the research to directly benefit 20 patients with binge eating disorder \[C8\]. The patients involved evaluated activities as helpful; one patient highlighted the experience of a “lightbulb moment” in understanding their overeating \[C9\]. 

 More recently in 2020, in partnership with the University of Jyväskylä \(Finland\), a COVID\-19 emotional eating online intervention was delivered internationally to 1200 participants from countries including UK, Spain, Italy, Finland, USA, China, South Korea and the Philippines. The findings on binge eating \[F4\] and food cravings \[F5\] were used to produce online self\-help materials, including a mindfulness\-based script to help with food craving, and a food and mood diary, aimed to help participants develop awareness of their emotional eating behaviours. Participants reported substantial benefits from the intervention, in terms of improved awareness of issues and improved self\-control of their binge eating \[C10\]. Comments from the participants were very positive, including “the connection between my mood and eating made me realise the control I had over my eating habits” \[C10\]. 

 Finally, effective usage of the Food Craving Inventory \[F5\] in clinical practice was highlighted by its inclusion in the clinical assessment handbook ‘Processed Food Addiction: Foundations, Assessment, and Recovery \(2018\)’. A Counselling Psychologist for North Bristol NHS Trust identified the handbook as a helpful tool for helping “better understand our participants as well as measure efficacy of our intervention” \[C11\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mackie’s research showed that homeless legislation in Wales, largely unchanged since 1977, was no longer fit for purpose as it only required local authorities to assist a minority of homeless people. His recommendations of new duties to assist all homeless people and focus on prevention formed the basis of a new law in Wales: the Housing \(Wales\) Act 2014. The legislation was replicated in England as the Homelessness Reduction Act \(2017\). Mackie’s subsequent research shaped the implementation of the Act in Wales through his membership of the Welsh Government’s Homelessness Action Group and his engagement with the third sector. Mackie’s research also informed homelessness policy debates in Scotland, Canada and Australia. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **2.1 Reviewing homelessness legislation in Wales** 

 In 2011, Mackie was commissioned by the Welsh Government to lead a team of five from two other research organisations, and one independent consultant, to undertake a comprehensive review of Welsh homelessness legislation. The review produced five reports – the most significant of which set out recommendations that would require the creation of new legislation **\[3.1\]**. As project lead, Mackie was key in deciding the direction of the review and cohering the research into the final recommendations. 

 Mackie’s large\-scale mixed\-methods review engaged widely with the homelessness sector and was the most significant review of Wales’ homelessness legislation in a generation. Research methods to assess the current legislation included collating and analysing a unique case level administrative data set on local authority homelessness assistance in Wales, as well as in\-depth interviews with key sector representatives. The research also took Welsh Government representatives to stakeholder workshops across the country. Two academic papers set the Welsh study in an international context, showing that Wales’ challenges were commonplace and that the proposed new legislation might be internationally transferable **\[3.2, 3.3\]**. The research concluded that homelessness services in Wales had begun to shift towards earlier interventions and away from crisis response, although there were four key weaknesses **\[3.2, 3.3\]**: 

-  legislation had not been effectively reoriented towards prevention; 

-  vast geographical variation in service availability; 

-  services were highly selective in relation to who receives and deserves support; 

-  prevention services were not a statutory requirement. 

 The review recommended a universal right to earlier, prevention\-focused services. The keystone of Mackie’s ‘Housing Solutions’ model was “a new duty for local authorities to take all reasonable steps to achieve a suitable housing solution for all households which are homeless or threatened with homelessness” **\[3.1\]**. Specific proposals included **\[3.1\]**: 

-  extending the definition of homeless from 28 to 56 days; 

-  the new duty would be owed to all eligible homeless households, with no account taken of priority need or local connection; 

-  changes to assessment of priority need, including adding two groups \(‘verified’ rough sleepers and young people under 25\), with a view to phasing out priority need entirely; 

-  assessing whether or not an applicant has become homeless ‘intentionally’ would become a power rather than a duty. 

 **2.2 Identifying what works to end rough sleeping** 

 In 2017 Mackie examined the impacts of the new Housing \(Wales\) Act 2014 **\[3.4\]**. This included analysing data on the outcomes for homeless households and interviewing 50 people who had sought homelessness assistance. Mackie concluded that services had been reoriented towards prevention, with fewer people remaining homeless after seeking help; however, there were failings in relation to some single people and rough sleepers **\[3.4\]**. He was subsequently commissioned by Crisis, a UK\-wide homelessness charity, to review the evidence base on what works to end homelessness with single people and rough sleepers, recommending key principles that should underpin a new policy approach **\[3.5\]**: 

-  recognising the varying housing and support needs and entitlements of rough sleepers; 

-  swift action to prevent or end street homelessness, and assertive outreach leading to a suitable accommodation offer; 

-  housing\-led – Housing First has been particularly effective in providing swift access to settled housing; 

-  person\-centred support and choice based on cross\-sector collaboration and commissioning. 

 **2.3 Reframing homelessness prevention and a future UK homelessness policy agenda** 

 In 2019 Mackie was involved in a collaborative study of homelessness prevention in the UK, leading to a co\-authored policy briefing **\[3.6\]**. Investigating the relative effectiveness of homelessness prevention across the four UK jurisdictions, he advanced a five\-category prevention typology for use as an analytical tool **\[3.6\]**: 

1.  Universal – preventing or minimising homelessness risks across the population; 

1.  Targeted – upstream prevention focussed on high risk groups \(i.e. vulnerable young people\) and risky transitions \(i.e. leaving local authority care or prison\); 

1.  Crisis – preventing homelessness likely to occur within 56 days, in line with legislation; 

1.  Emergency – support for those at immediate risk of homelessness; 

1.  Recovery – prevention of repeat homelessness and rough sleeping.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The evidence base provided by this body of research – Mackie’s identification of weaknesses in existing legislation, recommendation of a ‘Housing Solutions’ model of earlier, prevention\-focused services and recommendations of key policy principles – transformed homelessness legislation and policy. It underpinned new laws in Wales and England; shaped the implementation of legislation in Wales; and informed key policy debates in Scotland, Canada and Australia. 

 **4.1 Informing new homelessness legislation in Wales: The Housing \(Wales\) Act 2014** 

 Mackie’s commissioned research, including the ‘Housing Solutions’ model he recommended, was used in Welsh Government’s 2012 White Paper ‘Homes for Wales’ **\[3.1.\]**. The subsequent Housing \(Wales\) Act **\[5.1a\]** – passed in 2014 and commenced in 2015 – was described by Welsh Government as *""the most fundamental reform to homelessness legislation in over 30 years""* \(BBC News, 2015\) **\[5.1b\]**. 

 The Act was the world’s first legislation to mandate a right to homelessness prevention, with a new duty for local authorities to “help prevent homelessness…for <ins>everyone</ins> who is threatened with homelessness or who is homeless” **\[5.3a\]**. The Senior Homelessness Policy Officer at Welsh Government at the time described it as a *“ground\-breaking legislative development”* which *“draws upon the Mackie review”* **\[5.2\]**. They further noted: *“\[Mackie’s homelessness legislation review\], and the Housing \(Wales\) Act which emerged from it has significantly changed the way homelessness assistance is delivered in Wales and is impacting on the lives of thousands of homeless people”* **\[5.2\]** *.* 

 The Act contains the key change recommended by the review: a duty on local authorities to take “reasonable steps to help” <ins>all</ins> applicants who are homeless or threatened with homelessness **\[5.1a\]**. Previously, local authorities were only required to assist those deemed in priority need for assistance \(approximately 54% of homeless people\) **\[5.3a\]**. 

 Some of Mackie’s other recommendations included in the legislation **\[5.1a\]** are: 

-  extending the definition of homeless to 56 days; 

-  testing for intentionality was made a power rather than a duty for local authorities. 

 Emma Williams, Director of Housing and Regeneration in Welsh Government, stated: *“The legislation has been widely acclaimed for its success in changing the focus of local authority homelessness services to prevention rather than relief”* **\[5.2\]**. Welsh Government statistics \(April 2015\-March 2019\) show that since the new law commenced, more than 36,000 households have been assisted before they became homeless **\[5.3a\]**. Extending the methodology from **\[5.3b\]** to March 2019 means that homelessness has been prevented in 65% of these cases and the number of households who ultimately remain homeless after assistance has reduced by 57%. 

 **4.2 Shaping implementation of the Housing \(Wales\) Act 2014 and reframing homelessness prevention policy in Wales** 

 **a. National Assembly for Wales Inquiry into Rough Sleeping** 

 Despite the positive impacts of the 2014 legislation, an increase in rough sleeping led to a National Assembly for Wales Inquiry in 2018. Mackie was one of only two academics called to give evidence, which drew directly on his research findings **\[3.2, 3.6\]**. His evidence is cited 26 times in the final report \(2018\) and influenced many of its 29 recommendations, including **\[5.4a\]**: 

-  steps for phasing out priority need; 

-  strengthening Housing First as a default option for rough sleepers, due to its person\-centred approach, and that Welsh Government explore Housing First models; 

-  adopting models of *“assertive outreach support”*. 

 The Inquiry’s recommendations shaped the Welsh Government’s approach to tackling rough sleeping. For example, the recommendations were a factor in the Government’s decision to work with the Housing First network to establish an 18\-month trailblazer programme **\[5.4b\]**. Housing First is designed to support rough sleepers with complex or co\-occurring mental health and substance misuse issues. The Welsh Government has to date funded four projects providing 45 units of accommodation for individuals under this programme, which has housed people in independent, permanent homes and provided tailored, long\-term support **\[5.4b\]**. Julie James, Welsh Government Housing and Local Government Minister, stated: “We aim to support the most vulnerable people in Wales, and Housing First is a sound investment that can save money, as well as lives, in the long term” **\[5.4c\].** 

 **b. Welsh Government Homelessness Action Group to end homelessness in Wales** 

 In 2019 the Welsh Minister for Housing and Local Government set up an Action Group to provide a plan on preventing and ending homelessness. Mackie was the only academic invited to sit on the group of twelve, chaired by Crisis. Jon Sparkes \(Director\) and Matt Downie \(Policy Director\) of Crisis note that the Group was *“unique in its set up, and its remit to directly advise the Minister on strategies to end homelessness in Wales”* and that *“Mackie’s particular contribution to the Group centred around providing research and evidence for the group’s consideration and discussion”* **\[5.5\]**. The Group reviewed existing evidence on ending homelessness, including Mackie’s report for Crisis **\[3.5\]**. Recommendations for immediate actions – which were all accepted by the Minister – in the Group’s first report \(October 2019\) reflect Mackie’s work **\[5.6\]**: 

-  Recommendation 1: “ensure that there are sufficiently well\-trained assertive outreach workers deployed…”; 

-  Recommendation 6: “all public bodies must ensure that everybody discharged from a public institution has a sustainable housing solution”; 

-  Recommendation 10: “Remove the barriers and address misunderstandings that stop people at risk of homelessness or who are rough sleeping from accessing the basic human need for adequate housing and support”. 

 Crisis confirmed that the Group’s final report \(March 2020\) **\[5.6\]** was *“framed around the five\-category prevention typology”* **\[5.5\]** advanced by Mackie in **\[3.6\]**. Emma Williams, Welsh Government’s Director of Housing and Regeneration, noted that *“the report…has underpinned the Welsh Government’s response to the COVID 19 crisis and our plans to ensure that no one should be forced to return to the streets post pandemic”* **\[5.2\]**. All of the report’s recommendations have been accepted in principle by the Minister **\[5.5\]**. 

 **c. Shaping third sector practice** 

 Mackie supported third sector homelessness agencies in Wales to advocate for change on homelessness challenges in Wales, develop their policies and provide guidance on implementation of the Housing \(Wales\) Act 2014. Jennie Bibbings, Campaigns Manager at Shelter Cymru, confirmed that Mackie’s *“considerable support and guidance to our policy and research functions”* has included helping to deliver robust policy studies; increasing the agency’s research capacity through co\-location of PhD students; advising *“major funders on their strategic direction in order to maximise resources available for homelessness work”;* and *“\[challenged\] services to raise standards of implementation \[of the Act\]”* **\[5.7\]**. Frances Beecher, Chief Executive of homeless charity Llamau, confirmed that Mackie *“continues to provide the evidence base and understanding to help challenge remaining issues with the homelessness legislative framework in Wales, particularly with regard to the lack of priority need status for many young people”* **\[5.7\]**. 

 Beecher also acknowledged Mackie’s key role as a founder member and research lead for the agency’s End Youth Homelessness Cymru \(EYHCymru\) campaign. His *“support and understanding… enabled EYHCymru to develop its key priorities and establish a strategy capable of ending youth homelessness in Wales within ten years”* **\[5.7\]**. 

 **4.3 Informing new homelessness legislation in England** 

 The Homelessness Reduction Act \(HRA\) \(2017\) was introduced in England in 2018 **\[5.8\]**. Crisis, the main advocate for changing the law in England, states that it *“marks the most significant transformation to the homelessness legislation in England in the last 40 years, placing a much sharper focus on preventing people from losing their homes in the first place”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Crisis convened a panel of experts in 2015 to assess the existing statutory framework and draw from the Mackie Review and the Housing \(Wales\) Act 2014, which *“was seen to be sector\-leading and formed the basis of the English version”* **\[5.5\]**. They confirmed that Mackie was *“instrumental in developing”* a new Act in England by providing advice and guidance to the panel and modelling the potential impact of a preventative form of legislation. Mackie’s research was central to articles highlighting the success of the Welsh legislation in the media and this *“media attention led to widespread calls for the Westminster Government to replicate developments in Wales”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Crisis confirmed that their negotiations with the UK Government “ *were directly informed by Pete's work”* **\[5.5\]**.The legislation includes the main proposals from Mackie’s research, including a new duty for all local authorities to take ‘reasonable steps’ to help all applicants who are homeless or threatened with homelessness **\[5.7, 5.5\]**. Since it commenced, more than 250,000 households have been assisted before becoming homeless and in nearly 60% of these cases homelessness was prevented \(April 2018\-March 2020\). The legislation also reduced the number of households who ultimately remain homeless at the end of the process by approximately 50% **\[5.3c\]**. 

 **4.4 Informing policy debates in Scotland, Canada and Australia** 

 *Scotland*: The Scottish Government convened the Scotland Prevention Review Group to develop recommendations for a legal duty or duties to prevent homelessness. Mackie was invited to the first meeting of the group \(November 2019\), which built on the Welsh and English prevention legislation, to give an overview of the legislation in Wales and its impacts. 

 *Canada:* Following an ESRC IAA\-funded visit by Mackie to explore the potential for policy mobility, Section 5 of ‘The Roadmap for the Prevention of Youth Homelessness’ \(published by the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness and A Way Home Canada\) draws on Welsh legislation for an integrated approach to prevention **\[5.9\]**. The CEO of A Way Home Canada, stated: *“We cannot underestimate the importance of the Roadmap for communities and all orders of government to understand what prevention is and how it can be implemented in policy, planning and practice”* **\[5.9\]**. Mackie is on the international advisory panel for the organisation’s new federally\-funded Centre of Excellence on youth homelessness. 

 *Australia*: Following an invited visit from Mackie, agencies across the sector have advocated for change in line with the Welsh legislation. Council to Homeless Persons, the country’s lead third sector homelessness agency, stated: “Australia could reduce homelessness if we adopted the Welsh model of requiring governments to deliver prevention support” **\[5.10\]**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Institute for Design Informatics led five UKRI projects on the value and ethics of data, and how participatory approaches towards design thinking can foster engagement, benefitting over 190 companies and attracting over 44,000 attendees to its events. This research has generated the following impacts for companies in the financial and creative industries: 

1.  Increased understanding of the value of data, data\-driven technologies and distributed ledger technologies. 

1.  Generated a shift in culture towards enhanced data literacy and more ethical and informed practices of data\-driven innovation. 

1.  Created 6 new companies and 35 new jobs. 

1.  Developed new products and services, including 2 to be launched for the benefit of the 6,000,000 customers in Tesco Bank. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 The Institute for Design Informatics applies research in design thinking and prototyping to realise social and economic potentials of data and Distributed Ledger Technologies \(DLTs\). The Institute has pioneered a design approach to Human Computer Interaction \(HCI\), generating new insights into relationships between the flow of data, technology and design in the digital economy. Driven by the conviction that demystifying data is important for its meaningful adoption, the uniqueness of the team’s work lies in its focus on practice\-based research that develops toolkits and design prototypes. 

 The impact reported is underpinned by six key insights: 

1.  Changing the representation of value from money to data facilitates understanding of the concept of value. This insight was linked to the paper *GeoCoin: Supporting Ideation and Collaborative Design with Smart Contracts  \[3.1\], which reports on a location\-based platform through which participants engaged with smart contracts to explore digital ‘debit’ and ‘credit’ zones within the city. 

1.  As blockchain and distributed ledger technologies reconfigure traditional value chains \(from manufacturer to consumer\), designers need to consider broader ‘value constellations’ in which humans and artefacts interact, create and exchange data in new ways. This enables a new conception of valuation as a social practice, and a new conception of data itself as a performative agent in processes of valuation \[3.2\] \[3.3\] \[3.4\]. One of the key papers, *Sorting out valuation in the charity shop*, investigates the notion of ‘value constellations’ through an ethnographic study of contemporary UK charity shops \[3.3\]. 

1.  Design with data can reveal viable opportunities for the creation and use of new platforms and services that are powered by peer\-to\-peer validated blockchains \[3.2\]. Designers can create new systems in which people and things coexist in the production and use of data. The key paper was *Designing from/with/by Data* \[3.4\] which expands the notion of ‘value\-constellation’ to present an innovative classificatory framework for designers to better understand how to work with data in a climate where human\-data interaction is the key design challenge. 

1.  Organisational and public understanding of the principles of DLT and blockchain can drive the production of services and products based on these technologies and their attainment of critical mass adoption levels \[3.2\]. The key paper, 'Designing through value constellations' considered what it means to design value rather than products or services. 

1.  DLT and other data\-driven technologies raise important questions about ethics, such as issues of privacy and consent. These are vital for designers, companies and end users to address in order to comply with legislation and develop responsible products that build user trust. The key paper, *Sensing Data in the Home,* explored ethics of human\-computer interaction through an ethnographic case study of a smart toilet roll holder prototype \[3.6\]. 

1.  Participatory activities and experiential prototyping through physical modelling using tools such as Lego can aid public understanding of and engagement with data and DLTs by making these technologies tangible and intelligible. The key paper was *'Effing' the ineffable: opening up understandings of the blockchain* \[3.5\] which reports on a toolkit that used simplified physical modelling to enhance understanding of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and the transmission of data through Blockchain. Lego and coloured stickers enabled participants to simulate transactions on a Blockchain Lego ‘block’. 

 Building on these research successes, in 2018 the DI team won major AHRC funding to establish the Creative Informatics Research and Development programme, set up to further drive the growth of a community of data\-driven creative industries and talent in Edinburgh and its regions.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Through collaborative research on design with data, the Institute for Design Informatics \(DI\) has built partnerships across a range of organisations aimed at stimulating design thinking, enhancing the understanding of distributed ledger technologies \(DLTs\) and ensuring that questions of ethics are foregrounded in the use of data to create value. Impact has been generated through a range of activities including over 100 workshops, exhibitions, and events with over 44,000 attendees \[5.1\]. This has created “a strong community of practice among thought leaders across the financial and creative sectors which help spark ideas and create synergies across sectors” \[5.2\] and increased understanding of data\-driven innovation within organisations, leading to culture shifts, new jobs and products. These impacts have included: 

###  Shaping methods and thinking in NatWest Open Experience \(OX\) 

 Through collaboration with NatWest Open Experience \(OX\), a creative, collaborative organisation dedicated to innovation, DI research has enhanced understanding and wider applications of data\-driven innovation. The Head of Partnerships and Open Experience confirms that the research “opened our eyes to the wider applications of data driven innovation” and “informed our approach, particularly in the use of cultural probing methods for ideation and design across data\-driven technologies.” The partnership also provided OX with access to talent and the shaping of new posts: in 2015 they recruited a DI Master’s students, who had been a research assistant on several of the UKRI funded projects, into a new role as Creative Lead in OX. “His research methods and approaches were significant in shaping that role, and this has been sustained through the appointment of a new Creative Lead from September 2019” \[5.2\]. 

###  Enhanced data literacy leading to new jobs and new products at Tesco Bank 

 In 2018 and 2019, DI delivered *Mercury*, a GBP165,840 contracted, co\-designed and research\-based training programme for Tesco Bank. The aim was to extend the data literacy of the Tesco design team and position the bank at the forefront of data\-driven products and services within the sector. The programme consisted of lectures \(attended by approximately 80 colleagues from the bank\) and tailored workshops \(attended by approximately 30\) designed by DI, including Lego to understand blockchain \[3.5\] and Geocoin to understand smart contracts \[3.1\]. It culminated in a showcase during the Edinburgh Fringe festival \(2018\) that was reported by the BBC and four Scottish newspapers with a joint circulation of 1,700,000 copies \[5.3\].  The Director of Marketing and Customer Strategy stated that the programme led to a “significant and sustained culture change” within Tesco Bank. It prompted them to shift their focus “away from selling standard bank products” and, through analysis of customer demand, “toward more sophisticated ways of managing personal finances” and developing “user\-centred data\-driven solutions to that end” \[5.4\]. This in turn led to creation of 18 new jobs, including the doubling of the design team from 12 to 24 and the establishment of a new team of 6 to identify needs of their 6M customer base \[5.4\]. 

 The workshops also contributed to the development of two new products currently being tested for launch in 2021. The first involves a new model for loyalty card use whereby points are converted to a pseudo currency enabling wider use than in\-store discounts. This is informed by the insights gained through exposure to blockchain and distributed ledger technologies \[3.5\]. The second, inspired by \[3.1\], is an app based on smart contracts which uses data about customers’ shopping habits to incentivise savings and spending, supporting customers to better manage their money. Tesco Bank confirms that “Neither of these products would have been developed without the research\-based insights provided by the Mercury programme.” \[5.4\]. 

###  Raising awareness of the value of data in advertising 

 In 2018, the DI team was commissioned by the Data and Marketing Association \(DMA\), Europe’s largest community of digital marketers, to write a white paper for their Value of Data campaign. The paper, launched in May 2019, presented new insights into the relationship between data and value in businesses, the co\-creation of value within digital economies and the ethical implications and uses of data \[5.5\]. It was downloaded over 1,100 times, underpinned a series of nine talks with a total of 595 registered and 417 attendees/live views \[5.6\]. 

 The Managing Director of DMA confirmed that the paper expanded DMA and its membership’s thinking around data. It “opened up a much richer discussion on what responsible innovation and marketing means; with ethical considerations being part of the value proposition to customers. The result has been a shift towards responsible marketing, with businesses engaged in the value and ethics of data” \[5.6\]. 

 Speed was invited as keynote speaker to two events hosted by DMA at the Scottish and UK Parliaments. DMA confirmed that “These events put the association in a stronger position to engage with policy. We have seen this in particular in follow up discussions on talent development which now is framed around value of data.” \[5.6\]. The campaign is ongoing: Luger was commissioned to provide a bespoke workshop for Samsung’s legal, marketing and data teams, and an open webinar on data and ethics \(May 2020, 103 views\) \[5.6\]. 

###  Growing the creative industries through Data Driven Innovation 

 The launch of Creative Informatics \(CI\) at the start of 2019, a GBP7,700,000 R&D programme \(AHRC, Scottish Funding Council, Edinburgh City Region deal\) has further enhanced the establishment of a community of data\-driven creative industries and talent in Edinburgh and its region. To date, over 190 companies and entrepreneurs have benefitted directly from the programme through R&D and the development of new skills and ideas, based on insights from previous DI research. 6 of these are new companies created as a result of the programme, and several others small start\-ups using the programme to become sustainable businesses. 10 companies have already reported that the CI programmes contributed significantly to them securing additional investments and/or grant funding totalling GDP1,696,798, whereas 16 companies report 17.5 news job created, with another 19.5 being safeguarded as result of the programme \[5.7\]. 

 One such company is SuperRational Ltd, a cloud\-based digital rights management company. Following participation in the CI accelerator and resident entrepreneur programmes as well as producing one of the CI lab events, they went on to secure GDP375,000 private investment, leading to 5 full time and 6 part time/contracted jobs andthe development of a DDI product called Delic that enables musicians to have greater control of their work \(to date, over 450 people have signed up to the Delic app, which will be launched fully Summer 2021\). Speaking about the benefits of the CI programme, the Founder and Creative Director of SuperRational explained how it reiterated “the value of research\-based, data\-driven development”, helping the company refine their research approach, evolve their thinking about data, and reconsider ethical issues around technology. “The session on speculative design was particularly inspiring and broadened the horizon of product development” \[5.8\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Climate policy since the early 1990s has depended heavily on the notion of “CO<sub>2</sub>\-equivalent emissions” that equate one tonne of methane with a certain number of tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>. This is problematic because CO<sub>2</sub>\-induced warming is proportional to cumulative \(time\-integrated\) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while methane\-induced warming is not. While this has long been known to be a problem, research at Oxford Physics proposed a simple but accurate solution that equates a change in methane emission rate with an absolute number of tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> using well\-established constants. The simplicity of the solution and the fact that it relied on constants that were already familiar in policy circles resulted in much wider uptake than previous proposals based on bespoke modelling of methane impact. This Oxford\-led work was a key influence on the Zero Carbon Act in New Zealand, is informing climate policy in the UK, Norway, European Union and Republic of Ireland, contributed to public understanding of the climate impact of agriculture and diet, has been incorporated in major international reports, and informed agricultural sector professionals. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after CO<sub>2</sub>, contributing 25% of CO<sub>2</sub>’s contribution to warming to date, and 11% of the current CO<sub>2</sub>\-induced warming trend. A science\-based treatment of methane emissions has long proved a challenge for climate policy. Research at Oxford Physics established in the 2000s that CO<sub>2</sub>\-induced warming is proportional to cumulative \(time\-integrated\) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but it was immediately noted that this result could not apply to methane. In 2011, the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change commissioned a study, “Assessing the options for greenhouse gas metrics \-\- TRN 307/11/2011” led by Oxford Physics and the Oxford Environmental Change Institute involving CEH Wallingford, the Met Office, University of Reading and Tau Scientific, which resulted in a series of publications \[1\-5\] that culminated in a scientifically robust unified treatment of methane and CO<sub>2</sub> that is, crucially, simple enough for use by government officials and agricultural professionals in climate policy. 

 Early work \[1\] \(led by the Met Office and UK Climate Change Committee, with Oxford Physics contributing to study design and modelling implications for decadal temperature projections\) showed that peak global temperatures were determined by *cumulative* *emissions* of long\-lived climate pollutants \(LLCPs\) such as CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, and by *emission rates* of short\-lived climate pollutants \(SLCPs\) such as methane. This was followed in 2013 by a report \(led and implemented by Oxford Physics\) that explored the implications of \[1\] for meeting the goal of limiting global warming to 2°C above pre\-industrial levels \[2\]. 

 In 2016, an Oxford\-led team \(involving collaborators from Reading, Leeds, the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre and CICERO in Norway: quantitative results were produced by Oxford, with collaborators contributing diverse views on interpretation and policy implications\) proposed a way of relating the impact of LLCPs and SLCPs on global temperature, subsequently known as GWP\*, by equating a permanent change in the emission rate of an SLCP with a one\-off emission of a fixed quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> \[3\]. The key contribution of this work was to point out that it was possible to equate the impacts of LLCPs and SLCPs using existing quantities \(CO<sub>2</sub>\-equivalent emissions reported using 100\-year Global Warming Potential\) that were already widely reported. Application to a selection of real global emission scenarios and country\-level emissions by the team in 2018 \(with additional involvement of the Oxford Environmental Change Institute, Oxford Martin School and Victoria University of Wellington\) gained wider appreciation of the implications and potential importance of this research \[4\]. 

 The formula from the 2016 report \[3\] was further refined in 2019 to better represent the temperature impact of methane emissions, by a similar team \(now led by the Oxford Environmental Change Institute/Oxford Martin School\), where members of Oxford Physics were involved in initiating and developing the work \[5\]. The amended formula allows more accurate incorporation of SLCPs into carbon budgets. Oxford Physics has been heavily involved in exploring the policy implications, including a high\-impact publication using climate modelling to compare the climate impacts of cattle production with ‘lab\-grown meat’ \[6\], highlighting the contrasting dynamics of energy\-sector and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Although apparently a simple update to accounting principles, the impact of the revised treatment of methane on climate policy, particularly for agriculture, is considerable. Under the traditional 100\-year Global Warming Potential \(GWP<sub>100</sub>\) used for greenhouse gas reporting by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\), in climate policy in the UK and EU, and ubiquitously in “carbon footprint” calculations, methane emissions are simply multiplied by 28 to give “CO<sub>2</sub>\-equivalent” emissions. Oxford Physics have shown that the actual rate of “CO<sub>2</sub>\-warming\-equivalent” emissions, which generate approximately the same amount of warming whether emitted as CO<sub>2</sub> or methane, is given \[5\] by multiplying the current methane emissions rate by 112 and subtracting the methane emission rate of 20 years ago multiplied by 105. Hence the traditional metric overstates the impact of constant methane emissions by a factor of 4 \(an issue for traditional livestock farmers and in quantifying the environmental impact of supermarket supply chains\), while simultaneously understating the impact of changes in methane emission rates, also by a factor of 4 over the first 20 years after the change \(an issue for regulation of new methane sources such as fracking\). 

 This work bridges the gap between contemporary climate physics and the ‘emission metrics’ commonly used by policy\-makers, industry, environmental scientists and the general public to quantify impact on climate. It provides a new conceptual framework to compare the impacts of different activities on global temperatures, with especially important implications for the assessment of agricultural sustainability. 

###  Improving policy targets for methane emissions 

 The 2015 Paris Agreement calls for signatories to take action on limiting global warming to no more than 2°C \(and ideally no more than 1.5°C\) above pre\-industrial levels, while also recognising the fundamental priority of safeguarding food security. As energy\-sector emissions decline, agricultural emissions will become increasingly prominent, yet the majority of countries have yet to incorporate them into climate policy. The research outlined in Section 2 has focussed attention on what must be done to achieve these aims, as highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, which contained a specific Box \(Cross Chapter Box 2, pg 66\-68, \[A\]\) on the role of cumulative and short\-lived climate pollutants in meeting ambitious temperature goals, with the figure provided by Oxford based on their research \[3\] and \[4\]. 

###  New Zealand Zero Carbon Act 

 Methane emissions make up around half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions under conventional accounting, and it has the highest per capita methane emission rate in the world \(6 times the global average\), as, unusually for a developed country, a large part of its economy is based on agriculture. Research produced by Oxford Physics has been heavily cited in the debate over the New Zealand Zero Carbon Act, and has influenced one of its key policies – to treat biogenic methane separately to other greenhouse gases, and to set reduction, not elimination, targets for methane emissions. The Zero Carbon Bill was developed from submissions by Generation Zero, a youth\-led climate activist organisation who in July 2018 produced a Submission \[B\] on the Zero Carbon Bill citing \[1\]\-\[4\] \(plus two other Oxford\-led publications, extensively\) as key evidence for the need to recognise the difference between LLCPs and SLCPs with a ‘two baskets’ approach. In parallel, the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre released a report \[C\] in August 2018: “The contribution of methane emissions from New Zealand livestock to global warming” which cites \[3\] and \[4\], and was in turn cited in much of the documentation around the introduction of the Zero Carbon Act \[D\]. Myles Allen has given Climate Change Minister James Shaw two in\-person briefings on the topic, while co\-author of \[2\], \[4\] and \[5\] D. J. Frame \(formerly of Oxford Physics, now Victoria University of Wellington\) has been cited several times in person in Parliamentary debates \[E\]. In May 2019 the New Zealand Government decided to introduce the Zero Carbon Bill as an amendement to the Climate Change Response Act 2002, and produced the ‘Climate Change Response \(Zero Carbon\) Amendment Bill: Summary’ which included the key policy to “ *distinguish between biogenic methane and all other greenhouse gases*”, citing both the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 Degrees \(which features this research prominently, as noted above\), and directly citing reference \[4\] as an example of “ *expert advice… that the world must reduce emissions of both long\- and short\-lived gases to achieve the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal*”. The summary also has an explanatory section “Why a different target for biogenic methane?”, with the discussion on the separate treatment of biogenic methane occupying a full 2 pages of the 17\-page document \[D\]. The ‘Climate Change Response \(Zero Carbon\) Amendment Act 2019’ was signed into law on 13 November 2019 and sets separate mitigation targets for biogenic methane and all other greenhouse gas emissions: while all other greenhouse gases must fall to net zero emissions by 2050, biogenic methane emissions must decrease by 10% by 2030, and 24% to 47% by 2050 \(relative to 2017 rates\). 

###  Informing UK and European climate policy 

 The work described in section 2 continues to inform other nations as they develop policy to meet the Paris Agreement targets. The UK Committee on Climate Change cited \[4\] and \[6\] in their recent report ‘Land use: Policies for a Net Zero UK’ \[F\], and devoted a number of pages to the work and its implications for UK emission reduction policy. The GWP\* metric has been explicitly used in the White Paper behind Norway’s new Climate Plan for 2021\-2030 to document the climate impact of Norwegian agriculture \(\[G\] see pages 102\-103, including plots of annual and cumulative agricultural emissions under the GWP\* metric\). 

 The research is also informing policy development in the European Union, as evidenced by the enclosed letter from the Chair of JPI\-Climate \[H\]. John Lynch \(Oxford Physics\) was invited by the DG for Energy to present an intervention on methane emission abatement in agriculture for a European Commission event held on 9 June 2020. The topic is also under consideration in Ireland, with a working paper published by the Irish Climate Change Advisory Council on Climate Change Mitigation and the Irish Agriculture and Land Use Sector \[I\] citing \[3\] and considering the potential of the work for improved policy formulation. 

###  Communicating Agriculture’s Role in Climate Change Mitigation and Informing Agricultural Sector professionals 

 As methane emissions are such a large part of agricultural emissions, the issue of their misrepresentation in some climate metrics has generated much confusion and uncertainty in the agricultural industry and wider policy community, and is potentially hindering progress on climate change mitigation. The research presented here overcomes this challenge. Some of the limitations of treating agricultural emissions as directly analogous to fossil CO<sub>2</sub> were highlighted in \[6\], providing a case\-study comparing beef production to potentially energy intensive manufactured alternatives. This study received significant international media attention, bringing an improved understanding of different greenhouse gases to the public debate. The paper has been highlighted in major international policy reports from the IPCC \(Special Report on Climate Change and Land Use; Chapter 5: Food Security\), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \(Climate change: Unpacking the burden on food safety\) \[J\]. 

 The findings of \[1\]\-\[5\] have also been welcomed by farming associations, evidenced by a recent supporting statement by 15 agricultural bodies from the UK and New Zealand \[K\]. The ambition is that through adoption of a new framework that treats the majority of their emissions \(methane\) more fairly and transparently, it can be shown that farming can have an active role in maintaining climate within safe limits, while continuing to produce food, maintain landscapes/ecosystems, and support tourism, cultural traditions, rural communities and employment. 

 \~ **in New Zealand** 

 Myles Allen visited New Zealand in March 2019 to give a series of talks \(public and specialist, relating to both policy and science\) about climate change, with an emphasis on the correct ‘accounting method’ for methane, presenting this as an opportunity for New Zealand farmers to be world leaders in the global fight against global warming. The New Zealand Red Meat Industry have written to thank Myles “ *for the assistance and knowledge you have willingly given to our sector over the last 18 months. NZ Meat Industry have been like many industries seeking to understand the impacts and mitigations for Climate Change and your team has always readily helped with our learning and understanding*” \[L,M\]. Myles’ visit was well covered in the media, particularly in publications with an agricultural focus, including pieces in the New Zealand Herald \(readership 447,000\) and the Newsroom \(readership 100,000\) \[N\]. 

 \~ **in the United Kingdom** 

 The Oxford Physics authors of \[1\]\-\[5\] have built strong relationships with the agricultural sector, and have been issued with around 30 invitations to speak in this community, initially via the UK NFU \(National Farmers Union\) and then through people in the audience inviting them back to further events – for example Oxford Farming Conference and the Global Roundtable on Sustainable Beef \[N\]. They have also been approached by many stakeholders within the farming community to aid in their understanding and application of the work. The NFU funded a summer research assistant in 2019 to produce a study and internal report on UK agriculture, and the think tank IDDRI funded a summer student researcher in 2019 to work on a report on European scenarios. Co\-author on \[4\] and \[5\] Michelle Cain \(of the Oxford Martin School\) is working with Defra to apply GWP\* in strategic scenario analysis and the algorithm is being incorporated into the Agricalc on\-farm environmental footprint calculator developed by SRUC. This will be a test of how useful the method can be for allowing civil servants, local planning agencies and farmers themselves to analyse emissions data in terms of the effect it will have on global warming, and therefore enable them to prioritise policies to achieve their goals. \[F,G\] 

 This research, and the concept of GWP\* in particular, has been extensively covered in the international, UK, New Zealand and Irish agricultural media, including Country Life, Farmers Weekly and the Irish Farmers Journal. \[N\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In 2011, Dawson undertook an assessment of the ecological status of the marine environment surrounding the Pitcairn Islands, providing the first systematic assessment of the island’s marine and coastal biodiversity. Commissioned by The Pew Charitable Trusts and funded by DEFRA, the research provided the evidence base that has informed policy briefings and ministerial meetings, and provided the scientific underpinning for the Marine Protected Areas in the UK’s Overseas Territories’ campaign, championed by leading scientists and environmental campaigners, raising both public and political awareness. On the 15th September 2016, in response to the scientific evidence and the advocacy campaign, the UK Government took the historical step of creating the World’s largest Marine Protected Area \(MPA\) in the waters around the Pitcairn Islands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Before 2011, the scientific evidence for the state of the marine environment of the Pitcairn Islands exclusive economic zone \(EEZ\) was absent.  To address this, Dawson \(Principal Investigator\) was awarded a DEFRA Darwin Initiative UKOT Challenge Fund grant to support research that led to the first systematic characterisation of the marine ecology of the waters surrounding the Pitcairn Islands. In addition, the project included a household survey and engagement with island residents and stakeholders to establish a future conservation and management plan for the fisheries, marine and coastal biodiversity.  At the same time, The Pew Charitable Trusts, through their Global Ocean Legacy program, identified the islands as a candidate site within a system of large, fully protected marine reserves on a global scale.  Having approached Dawson with a view to collaboration, the outcomes of Dawson’s research provided the scientific underpinning of the subsequent campaign \(led by The Pew Charitable Trust\) to lobby the UK Government for the establishment of the Pitcairn Islands MPA. 

 The initial DEFRA UKOT Challenge Fund project undertook primary *in situ* underwater video coral reef surveys, as well as collation and analysis of local records, international surveys and relevant grey literature. The work produced a census of marine species that demonstrated there is high diversity in corals, reef fish and molluscs, and established a definitive list of 38 marine species found in waters around the Pitcairn Islands listed on the IUCN red\-list as globally threatened **\[R1, R2\]**, as well as several species new to Pitcairn \(e.g. freshwater prawn\).  Furthermore, it was established that the islands are an important breeding ground for a sub\-species of endangered humpback whale **\[R3\]**.  This evidence base, describing the extraordinary biodiversity in the seas surrounding the Pitcairn Islands, demonstrated for the first time in a systematic and rigorous way both the uniqueness of the marine environment and the relatively low anthropogenic impacts, but that the potential susceptibility to degradation through fishing pressures was profound **\[R1, R2\]**. 

 In conjunction with the assessments of biodiversity, the pilot project engaged with residents of the Pitcairn Islands to understand the requirements for a co\-developed community\-led marine management action plan \(September 2010\-2012\) to explore ways of protecting this sensitive ecosystem from future over\-exploitation \(predominantly from fishing\) **\[R4\]**. This was followed by further funding from DEFRA / DfID Darwin Initiative to develop a sustainable marine and fisheries management plan for the Pitcairn Islands \(2013\-2017\). Dawson moved from the University of Dundee \(UoD\) to Kings College London in October 2016, however the fieldwork and data analysis for all supporting research was completed whilst at UoD.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The census of marine species diversity, the threats posed by fishing and the requirements of Island residents, established from UK Darwin Initiative projects ‘Developing a community\-led marine management plan for the Pitcairn Islands’ and ‘A Sustainable Marine and Fisheries Management Plan for the Pitcairn Islands’ **provided the critical scientific underpinning to a subsequent campaign to designate a Marine Protected Area \(MPA\) around the Pitcairn Islands** **\[E1\]**. At the time of designation \(September 2015\) this was the world’s largest MPA and an important step forward in protecting a fragile environment and the communities of the Pitcairn Islands that depend upon it. 

 Informed directly by the assessment of biodiversity and stakeholder responses, a policy briefing aimed at the non\-scientific reader was commissioned by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office **\[E10\]**. This was widely disseminated to government ministers and as a result Dawson was twice invited to the UK Parliament to meet with ministers and the Foreign Office Director **\[E2\]**. 

 Dawson’s research directly led to the launch of the ‘Marine Protected Areas in the UK’s Overseas Territories’ campaign, led in the UK Parliament by a group of MPs including Zac Goldsmith MP. This campaign attracted support from other global marine scientists \(including researchers from Zoological Society London\) and high\-profile celebrities \(including Hugh Fearnley\-Whittingstall, Helena Bonham\-Carter and Gillian Anderson\) to lobby for the creation of the MPA **\[E3\]**, creating a sustained and high profile process of engaging the public and policy makers. The campaign was led by The Pew Charitable Trusts, Dawson and others such as the Blue Marine Foundation, and engaged National and International Media organisations to increase public awareness and draw political scrutiny. This culminated in an open letter \(signed by over 100 scientists and celebrity supporters\) being sent to the Prime Minister David Cameron, calling on the UK Government to designate the Pitcairn Islands Marine Reserve **\[E4\]**. 

 On 17 July 2014, a written question \(UIN 205917\) was raised in the UK House of Commons regarding the steps the UK Government were taking to protect biodiversity on the Pitcairn Islands **\[E5\]**. The response from the \(then\) Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office **explicitly cited the Dawson\-led Darwin\-funded projects that were developing marine and fisheries management plans as an example of UK Government contribution to protecting the region’s biodiversity**, and that the UK Government was working with stakeholders in drafting a revised Pitcairn Ordinance \(Law\) on environmental protection to entrench these protections further. 

 On 18 March 2015, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced in his Budget to Parliament that ‘The government intends to proceed with the designation of a Marine Protected Area around Pitcairn’. As the Senior Director Marine Habitat Protection, The Pew Charitable Trusts states “ **The success of the campaign to establish the MPA was contingent on \[Dawson’s research\] setting biological baselines, fully engaging with the Pitcairn Island community to ascertain their local needs and conservation objectives**, as well as partnering with The Pew Charitable Trusts to pitch the idea of the designation to the UK Government” **\[E1\]**. 

 Dawson and colleagues were consulted by the Pitcairn Islands Attorney General’s Office and contributed directly to the draft legislation that was introduced to establish an Ordinance to conserve and protect the Pitcairn Islands’ marine environment **\[E6\]**. The announcement of the formal designation of the Pitcairn Islands Marine Reserve was made on 14 September 2016 by the UK Government and on 15 September 2016, the waters surrounding the Pitcairn Islands officially became what was at the time the largest MPA in the World **\[E9\]**. 

 The Pitcairn Islands Marine Protected Area Ordinance \(2017\) established a zonation scheme for the whole of the Pitcairn Islands EEZ and the Coastal Conservation Areas \(CCA\) **\[E7\]**. 99.5% of the EEZ forms the non\-extractive MPA, thus ending commercial fishing in the area with only small\-scale, licensed subsistence and artisanal fishing allowed within the remaining 0.5%.  In addition to impacting on the conservation of marine ecology, the protection of endangered species and species unique to the area, the residents of the Pitcairn Islands **\[E1\]** have also benefitted through public engagement with the research, inputting directly to legislation for both conservation and management of the Island fisheries and biodiversity. 

 In 2018, a Fisheries Management Plan was written by Dawson in partnership with the Government of the Pitcairn Islands **\[E8\]**. The management plan was based upon the three\-year Darwin Initiative\-funded project from 2014 to 2015, for the management of fisheries within the CCAs. Ongoing activities include scientific \(and logistical\) contributions to the UK Government’s ‘Blue Belt Programme’, which is being delivered in partnership between the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science and the Marine Management Organisation.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Most crime is committed by a minority of serial offenders. The analysis of criminal behaviour using crime linkage can identify repeat perpetrators and increase the likelihood of resolving multiple crimes at once, streamlining police investigations. Tonkin and Bull’s research into crime linkage has changed policy, practice, and the law in the UK, New Zealand, Belgium, and Sweden. The research has enhanced crime linkage practice at multiple stages, from data collection and storage to the application of crime linkage techniques during ongoing police investigations. Ultimately, enhanced crime linkage ensures that the public are better protected from victimisation and enables greater access to justice for victims. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Most crime is committed by a minority of prolific, serial offenders \(for example, Falk et al \(2014\) estimates that over 60% of crime is committed by just 1% of offenders\). These serial offenders impose considerable financial and human costs on society in the UK alone this is estimated to be £18.1 billion/year. A key law enforcement strategy for tackling serial offending is crime linkage, which involves searching for crimes that are similar in terms of offender crime scene behaviour. Linking crimes in this way enhances the quantity and quality of evidence available to prosecute offenders and helps police investigations to work in a more cost\-effective and streamlined way. 

 Tonkin, Bull, and colleagues have worked with law enforcement agencies in the UK, New Zealand, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Canada, and South Africa to investigate how the behavioural sciences can be used to enhance the police’s ability to use crime linkage effectively. 

 Focusing on crime linkage across a range of crime types—including sexual offences, burglary, car theft, and robbery \[ **R1\-6**\]—their research has: 

1.  Demonstrated that crime linkage is a viable investigative technique; 

1.  Created new methods for recording/coding behavioural crime scene information; 

1.  Identified specific types of offender behaviour that are most useful for crime linkage; 

1.  Demonstrated how crime analysts can quantify the level of behavioural similarity between multiple crimes; 

1.  Developed novel, accurate and robust statistical techniques that can be used by the police to make crime linkage predictions during investigations and produced recommendations on how to use them. 

 An example of this work is the Leverhulme Trust\-funded \[G1\] Crime Linkage International Network \(C\-LINK: \[ **R7**\]\), established in 2013, of which Tonkin is a founding member. C\-LINK has academic and practitioner representatives from 12 countries, spread across 4 continents. As part of C\-LINK, Tonkin led the collection and analysis of data relating to 3,364 sexual offences committed in 5 countries. This dataset is the largest and most diverse and most relevant to policing practise ever collected to investigate crime linkage. The analyses led by Tonkin developed statistical algorithms/formulae that were able to identify linked sexual crimes with a high degree of accuracy \[ **R1, R2**\], thereby demonstrating that crime linkage has the potential to work reliably and accurately with sexual offences and justifying the use of this technique by international police agencies. 

 C\-LINK research addressed long\-standing limitations within the literature that have been recognised \(but unaddressed\) by researchers for over 15 years. These limitations have also been recognised by police practitioners and cited in the courts as a fundamental limitation of existing research \(see HM Advocate vs. Young, 2013\). C\-LINK addressed these limitations by testing crime linkage with a dataset containing solved, unsolved, serial and one\-off crimes. This was important because prior work had only tested crime linkage using solved, serial offences, which does not reflect the real\-world scenario in which crime linkage is conducted. 

 The C\-LINK research represents the most comprehensive test of crime linkage to date, and the best available evidence base with which to guide crime linkage practitioners who work with sexual offences.

 **4. Details of the impact**The research of Tonkin, Bull, and C\-LINK has changed policies, practices, and the law internationally through significantly enhancing the police’s ability to conduct more effective crime linkage. This has maximised opportunities to detect and prosecute serial offenders and provided victims with greater access to justice. Primary beneficiaries are police crime analysts conducting crime linkage and secondary beneficiaries are police investigators who can use crime linkage to help them solve crime more effectively. Additionally, the financial and human impact of serial offenders is significantly reduced. Ultimately, society benefits from the effective identification and prosecution of criminals. 

 Importantly, crime linkage also enhances access to justice for victims. It increases the chances of serial offenders being detected and successfully prosecuted for the full range of crimes they have committed \(rather than just one or two offences\). This ensures that perpetrators are brought to justice for the crime/s a victim has experienced and receive a sentence that is commensurate with their actual offending behaviour. 

  

 **Belgium:** 

 At an impact workshop in September 2017, the C\-LINK findings were disseminated to senior officials of the Zeden\-Analyse\-Moeurs \(ZAM\) unit. The information presented at this workshop formed an important component of the evidence that led to legislative change in Belgium \[ **E1**\]. Specifically, the Ministers of Justice, Security, and the Interior and the College of Attorney Generals in Belgium issued a legally binding circular on 27/02/2020 that directed police forces across Belgium to submit all sexual assault case files within 30 days of discovery to the ZAM unit, who have a national remit for conducting crime linkage in Belgium \[ **E2**\]. As a consequence of this legislative change, the ZAM unit now receives a more comprehensive overview of sexual offending across Belgium \[ **E2**\]. This benefits ZAM analysts by reducing the risk that they will miss links and benefits the Belgium National Police by enhancing their ability to detect and prosecute serial sexual offenders. This ensures that the Belgian public are better protected from the risk of sexual victimisation \[ **E2**\]. “As a direct result of the perceived quality and importance of the C\-LINK research  the ZAM unit has been formally allocated five full\-time positions” \[ **E1**\], formalising the roles of the existing staff in this unit. The unit was also given additional funding to double its staffing. Prior to C\-LINK, the Belgian ZAM unit was at risk of closure and had no officially documented working structure. Tonkin’s research, therefore, ensured the continued existence and subsequent expansion of the Belgian ZAM unit, meaning that Belgium retained its national crime linkage capabilities for sexual offences. 

  

 The C\-LINK research also underpins law enforcement training in Belgium. Since 2016, C\-LINK research has underpinned training delivered nationally to approximately 300 commissioners and high\-ranking officers through 8\-12 workshops a year \[ **E1**\]. 

 **UK:** 

 The research of Tonkin and C\-LINK \[ **R1, R2**\] has directly influenced national policy regarding the collection and storage of information relating to serial sexual offences and sexual murders across the UK. Prior to C\-LINK, the Serious Crime Analysis Section \(SCAS\) had been considering reducing the amount of information recorded on their databases. The C\-LINK research \[ **R1, R2**\] found that this would potentially undermine crime linkage and recommended against it via engagement with senior SCAS staff. As a result, this recommendation was adopted. This impacted the whole SCAS database \(31,962 offences, as of 04/06/2020\) and affects what data will be recorded for all future offences. This policy decision ensures that detailed behavioural data remain accessible to SCAS analysts and that the ability to detect serial sexual offenders and murderers across the UK is not compromised. 

  

 In addition, the findings of the C\-LINK projects are regularly quoted and referenced by Senior SCAS staff when providing training inputs on the SIO \(Senior Investigating Officer\) Development Programme, attended by Detective Chief Inspectors across England and Wales. Over the past 2 years, SCAS staff have provided inputs on 25 of these nationally accredited courses \[N≈300 staff\] \[ **E5**\]. 

 **New Zealand:** 

 The research of Tonkin and Bull has led to changes in how burglary data are collected, coded, and stored across New Zealand. In particular, their research underpinned the redesign of New Zealand Police databases, with the new database replicating variables from the coding dictionary of \[ **R3**\] and informing a reduction in system variables from 400 to 47. This has made crime reporting simpler and more efficient, affecting the 165,273 burglary offences entered into the system since the changes were implemented on 29/04/2018 and impacting all future recording of burglary offences across New Zealand \[ **E4**\]. 

  

 Moreover, crime analysts working for New Zealand Police report that Tonkin et al.’s research \[ **R1\-R6**\] has enhanced the practice of police analysts in 6 key ways \[ **E4**\]: \(1\) reducing/avoiding bias during crime linkage; \(2\) widening the scale and scope of crime linkage analysis; \(3\) ensuring more comprehensive crime linkage analysis; \(4\) enhancing the influence of crime linkage on police investigations; \(5\) contributing to the training of New Zealand Police staff; and \(6\) Supporting the detection and prosecution of serial offenders \[ **E4**\]. “The research of Dr Tonkin and colleagues has influenced crime linkage analyses in cases involving serial burglary, car theft, arson, sexual offending and robbery. In a number of these cases, this has resulted in successful prosecutions and the recovery of stolen property, thereby provided victims with greater access to justice” \[ **E4\].** 

 Specifically, New Zealand Police developed a crime linkage tool based on the research of Tonkin et al. \[ **R1\-R6**\]. The tool has been used to facilitate crime linkage during live investigations for a range of offences, including serial sexual offences, burglaries, robberies, arson offences, and car theft. The resultant analyses have been submitted to the Crown Prosecutor and the Crown Law Office of New Zealand, leading to successful apprehensions and prosecutions of serial offenders and the recovery and return of stolen property \[ **E4**\]. 

  

 For example, as described in \[ **E4**\], application of the tool led to the successful prosecution of a serial sexual offender for 11 rapes committed across three New Zealand cities in 2017. Similarly, analysis based on the tool has led to operational successes with burglary crime, with seven offenders in Napier successfully prosecuted for a total of 20 offences in 2018 and 3 offenders arrested and prosecuted in Hastings, the latter leading to the recovery of $20,000 of stolen property that was subsequently returned to victims. In 2019, the tool was applied to a series of car theft offences in Napier, leading to a new suspect being identified \(who was unknown to investigating officers at the time\) who was ultimately convicted of 11 offences and sentenced to 18\-months imprisonment. Additionally, the research \[ **R1\-R6**\] has been used in training delivered to a range of police staff, including members of the New Zealand Police Executive, the Analytical Service Group of the National Intelligence Centre and intelligence analysts, police investigators and managers from half of New Zealand Police districts \[ **E4**\]. 

 **Sweden:** 

 The research of Tonkin et al. \[ **R1, R2**\] has stimulated significant new investment in crime linkage within Sweden and led to the provision of new analytical services/investigative methods. After 14 years without national crime linkage capabilities, the Swedish Police Authority made the decision to reinstate the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System in order to facilitate crime linkage of sexual offences and homicides. As explained by officers leading the Investigative Analysis and Offender Profiling Group in Sweden \[ **E3**\], the C\-LINK research disseminated by Tonkin et al. at the 2018 annual conference of the European Association of Psychology and Law \(EAPL\) “was an important part of this decision”.  This led to creation of a new national unit of crime analysts, currently in the process of recruiting and training new staff.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The introduction, nature and scope of lobbying regulation – the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016 – in Scotland has been shaped by Dinan’s research on lobbying and political communication. 

 Ethnographic research and knowledge exchange work helped build the case for statutory regulation, responding to calls for a more transparent politics following devolution. Research established a framework for regulation that both informed the demands of transparency campaigners and highlighted the need to avoid loopholes. 

 Nearly a third of registrants under the recently introduced disclosure system reflect categories recommended through Dinan’s research. This accounts for a significant proportion of lobbying activity now disclosed, leading to a substantial improvement in lobbying transparency in Scotland. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A key finding of the research was that devolved Scotland was not as 'open' and transparent as the rhetoric surrounding Scottish politics suggested, and that in particular there was a need for lobbying transparency to enhance democratic accountability \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\). The research also evidenced the profound problems with lobbying self\-regulation, and informed subsequent knowledge exchange work on statutory approaches to this issue. The work also highlighted the difficulty that many voluntary and third sector organisations experienced in relation to lobbying disclosure and the challenges that demands for transparency placed on civil society groups. This is important because the legislative proposals for a Scottish lobbying register had to be designed to cater proportionately for a wide variety of lobbying organisations and seek to meet public accountability concerns. 

 The research underpinning impact in the current REF cycle comprises an ongoing programme of research and knowledge exchange dating from 2000 to the present. Dinan’s work on lobbying transparency has involved extensive and sustained research and knowledge exchange activities with policy makers and civil society groups \(in Scotland, UK, and EU\). This research informed deliberation on lobbying disclosure in Scotland. Dinan’s ethnographic research on lobbying organisations and lobbying regulation in Scotland was designed and conducted at Stirling \( **R1**, **R2**\), with impacts occurring and further underpinned by research produced \( **R4**\) after he re\-joined Stirling in the current REF period. 

 The initial fieldwork \(2000\-2003\) on Scottish political communication comprised extended fieldwork and observation of the developing lobbying industry around the new Scottish Parliament, up until 2003. It involved 73 interviews with various corporate and voluntary sector lobbyists, public servants, and elected representatives. It also drew upon participant observation at more than 70 official, public, and private meetings for those involved in public affairs in Scotland. This research was supplemented by extensive media monitoring and analysis of lobbying in popular and trade press \( **R1**, **R3**\). During this fieldwork the Scottish Parliament Standards Committee started an investigation of lobbying. Initial research findings were submitted as written evidence to the Holyrood inquiry, and the research team were called to give evidence before the Committee \( **R3**\). The research team were the only academics then advocating a register based around full disclosure by *all* lobbyists, including commercial consultants, in\-house corporate lobbyists as well as charities and civil society organisations. This policy engagement was built upon extensive fieldwork and led to the research team developing recommendations to underpin a lobbying disclosure system for the Scottish polity. This had not been part of the original research design, but was developed in response to the unanticipated opportunity to engage with policy makers and stakeholders on the question of how best the Scottish Parliament as a political institution should handle relations with outside interests. 

 The second phase of the research on lobbying in Scotland \(2014\-2018\) has focused on examining lessons to be drawn from other legislatures with lobbying disclosure systems, and the quality and utility of lobbying disclosures for enhancing democratic accountability \( **R4**\). This work also considers the opportunities afforded by new media and communication technologies to make information on lobbying available in a timely manner to help inform media and civil society groups to play a watchdog role in relation to efforts to influence public policy. Dinan organised and convened an expert policy seminar in Stirling in November 2015 to disseminate the latest research and practice evidence, bringing together regulators and academics from the EU and US with the bill team designing the Scottish legislation, as well as members of the Scottish Parliament committee scrutinising the legislation.

###  4. Details of the impact 

-  The impact here relates to both policy development and legislation in regard to the regulation of lobbying in Scotland, and impact on the submissions and advocacy strategies of civil society organisations in relation to lobbying transparency. ESRC funded research on lobbying and Public Relations was popularised in the media and in policy circles including via official consultations into lobbying \(R3 & E1, E3a & b\) with identifiable effects on all of the bodies noted. 

 **Impact: The Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016** 

-  Dinan \(and colleagues then at Stirling\) were the only academics to argue for a statutory lobbying register in Scotland in 2001 \(R3 & E1\) and amongst a small group in the EU. The effect of this work is acknowledged to be significant by policy actors. 

 **Initiating the legislation** 

-  The pathway to legislation – the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016 – that created a statutory lobbying register was through a Private Members Bill introduced by Neil Findlay MSP at the Scottish Parliament on 6 July 2012. **Findlay’s Bill was heavily influenced by the findings of the research** noted above \(R1, R2\) as well as the insights from subsequent knowledge exchange work with civil society groups interested in transparency promotion \(E2\). As Findlay states, his Bill was directly influenced by this research: 

-  ‘I am certain that had Dinan and his colleagues at Stirling not carried out their initial work on lobbying in Scotland my private members Bill… may well have never been introduced. Their academic work created the space and provided some of the evidence that underlines the need for such a Bill’ \(E4a., Neil Findlay MSP testimonial\) 

-  **Findlay’s bill went on to lead directly to and inform the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Bill**, now Act. As a Scottish Government briefing explains: 

-  ‘Mr Findlay’s Bill received broad support in the Parliament \(31 MSPs\) and, in May 2013, he lodged a final proposal for his Bill. Subsequently, in June 2013, the Scottish Government announced, under Rule 9.14.13 of the Parliament’s Standing Orders, that it would introduce legislation of its own to give effect to the proposal in Mr Findlay’s Member’s Bill.’ \(E3a, p.9\) 

-  Therefore, the research had a direct impact on the case for introducing such legislation. Furthermore, the research underpinned key provisions of the proposed legislative framework. 

 **Informing the legislation** 

-  Following the Scottish Government’s decision to introduce legislation, **Dinan played a prominent role in the deliberations among civil society groups in Scotland**, scrutinising this issue, as well as submitting evidence to both Scottish Parliamentary \(2014\) \(E3a\) and Scottish Government \(2015\) \(E3b\) inquiries. Based on his research in this area, he was then appointed to the official Holyrood Lobbying Register Working group in 2017 to advise on aspects of implementation \(see section below\) of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016 \(E5\) and continues to work with Scottish civil society groups interested in monitoring lobbying disclosure. 

-  Dinan participated in the official Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee round\-table discussing key elements of the Scottish Government's proposals for lobbying regulation, 12 November 2015 \(E6a\). In late November 2015, he convened an expert policy seminar at the University of Stirling focused on regulatory design and the mechanics of realising transparency in relation to lobbying and political communication. The seminar involved participants from Scottish Government, Scottish Parliament \(including chair and clerks of Standards Procedures and Public Appointments Committee, and Corporate Body\), Westminster and Irish regulators, public servants working on lobbying and related ethics issues from EU and Scotland, and a number of invited academics. The seminar was held to ensure that decision makers in Scottish Government were appraised of best available research and practice insights while deliberating on the provisions of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Bill that would eventually become the basis for legislation in 2016 \(E6b\). 

-  In his capacity as a founding member of the Scottish Alliance for Lobbying Transparency \(SALT\), Dinan also briefed the responsible Minister for Parliamentary Business \(Joe Fitzpatrick\) in January 2016 \(E8, p.54, 85\) and also met with the civil servants drafting the stage 1 and 3 legislative proposals \(June 2015 and March 2016\). As the Electoral Reform Society, Scotland, state on the influence of Dinan and his research’s contribution to this process: 

-  ‘Dinan’s research added legitimacy to the campaign and helped develop our asks. His attendance at various meetings with Civil Servants and politicians where he was able to explain his research were vital in ensuring the lobbying register became law.’ \(E4b., Electoral Reform Society, Scotland testimonial\) 

-  The Minister for Parliamentary Business subsequently acknowledged the impact of SALT: ‘The vibrancy of such debate and that campaign are important to Parliament and to Scottish democracy.’ \(E6c, p.85\) 

-  The research directly informed the advocacy of pro\-transparency civil society groups in Scotland, which attracted widespread popular support during parliamentary deliberation on the provision of the Lobbying Bill \(E7\). Dinan used his role in SALT and his research and policy expertise to shape key campaigning demands that were eventually included in legislation. 

-  Research highlighted the need to avoid loopholes and bring transparency to lobbying activities targeted at the civil service and special advisors in government. These recommendations were reflected in stage 3 amendments to the legislation accepted by the Scottish Government, and approved by the Scottish Parliament: 

-  ‘\[I\]t is very clear the impact the research had and it is easy to trace the way it impacted on crucial legislation which now governs the operation of Parliament in Scotland. There was no alternative source of this research and I doubt it would have been possible to win the changes we won without it’. \(E4d., Common Weal testimonial\) 

-  Dinan’s expertise and engagement with policy makers to explain the research and evidence from different regulatory systems has been a common thread running through the phases of policy activism and deliberation at Holyrood on the topic of lobbying transparency. 

-  ‘Thanks to his support and research, parliamentary and stakeholder debates that input to the development process of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Bill were considerably more informed than would otherwise have been the case, which served to make the Bill a more successful piece of legislation.’ \(E4d., Transparency International testimonial\) 

-  Dinan is the only academic who has participated in all of these policy processes and this has ensured that the Stirling research is well known to politicians and officials charged with developing and running the lobbying register. 

 **Implementing the legislation** 

-  The research \(R1 to R4\) and knowledge exchange activity with stakeholders in Scotland \(E2, E6c, p.54\) informed Dinan’s contributions as the only academic member of the Lobbying Register Working Group \(E5\), which was tasked with advising civil servants at the Scottish Parliament on the implementation of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act and developing detailed draft Parliamentary Guidance and a Code of Conduct for people lobbying MSPs. Dinan was used as an expert source for the stakeholder and scoping research undertaken on behalf of the Holyrood Lobbying Registrar’s office \(E9\). 

 **The Impact of the Lobbying \(Scotland\) Act 2016** 

-  The Chief Executive of the Scottish Parliament has recently described the lobbying register as ‘a very valuable source of transparency about public life in Scotland’ \(E10\). The legislation has directly impacted on some 1,189 registrants across Scotland who have disclosed lobbying activity since March 2018. Nearly 30% of those registrants are within the categories of lobbyists that the Stirling research \(R1\) recommended should be included in any disclosure system, but which were initially excluded in legislative proposals. These groups also account for a significant proportion of the substantive information returns of lobbyists disclosing their lobbying activities under the legislation \(2,736 returns, representing 40% of disclosures\) \(E10\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Operational Earthquake Forecasting \(OEF\) has been mandated and implemented at a multi\-national scale to quantify, communicate and manage risk to society from natural and induced seismicity. Beneficiaries include local populations at risk; Government Agencies responsible for risk assessment, licensing and regulation; Local Authorities; Civil Protection Agencies and Emergency Responders; and Operators of hydrocarbon fields.  The New Zealand government instituted a one\-year mandatory retrofit programme for reinforced masonry in central New Zealand in the aftermath of the 2016 magnitude 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake, heavily guided by OEF information. The Dutch Government approved gas production plans at Groningen from 2016\-2018 with significant operational changes and economic impact, based on operational earthquake forecasts from the field operators. Main’s research on quantifying earthquake predictability and forecasting power under uncertainty informed the development of the protocols of OEF and its application. 

  
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Before 2000, research on earthquake predictability had centred mainly on the issue of whether reliable precursors existed, and on the possibility of deterministic prediction of the ‘time, location and magnitude of future events, within narrow limits, above chance’. Research led by Main since 2000 explored multiple aspects of earthquake predictability and forecasting in a probabilistic framework that accounts for uncertainty. The approach was developed from multiple standpoints, including stochastic modelling, statistical seismology, statistical physics, and rock physics perspectives, and informed the framing of time\-dependent operational earthquake forecasting protocols for natural and induced seismicity by direct citation in the International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting \(ICEF\) report to the Department of Civil Protection in Italy published in 2011 \(see route to impact at the start of section 3\). 

 Research led by Main provided a clear theoretical framework to explain the practical difficulty of accurately predicting individual earthquakes in a near\-critical system such as Earth’s brittle lithosphere, while allowing a finite degree of low\-probability forecasts of likelihoods for a population of events **\[**e.g. **3.1\]**. This accounted for the practical difficulty of predicting individual earthquakes deterministically, while simultaneously allowing a degree of lower probability forecasting power \- above the background rate \- that is the basis for OEF. To help quantify the forecasting power in space and time, Huc & Main provided the first estimate of the evolution of the likelihood of triggered events at different epicentral distances and times between events in global earthquake data, notably the discovery of ‘anomalous’ \(non\-Gaussian\) diffusion of epicentres of triggered events in space and time **\[3.2\]**. 

 The research has also established theories and methodologies for the evaluation of earthquake hazard from both background \(considered independent\) and triggered, \(considered dependent\) seismicity \- in particular allowing for the uncertainty associated with selecting the optimal model for the frequency\-magnitude distribution **\[3.3\]**, and in separating background from triggered seismicity in epidemic\-type aftershock sequence models **\[3.4\]**. The frequency\-magnitude distribution is crucial because it controls the likelihood of rare, high\-impact, extreme events. The separation of background from triggered events is critical because the background hazard is used to develop building design codes \- the front line of defence against earthquakes in urban settings. 

 The ratio of triggered to background event rate can be used to quantify the improvement in forecasting power during seismic sequences, expressed as a probability gain over the background rate. Both rates are subject to uncertainty caused by the finite and relatively short time window for recorded earthquakes compared to the average recurrence time between large events. Greenhough & Main addressed this issue by quantifying the systematic error in applying different methods to invert for model parameters, while fully accounting for larger uncertainties in the frequency of larger and extreme events **\[3.5\]**. 

 Main & Bell also contributed to the design of laboratory experiments and interpretation of their results **\[**e.g. **3.6\]** to quantify the evolution of seismic energy release as a function of differences in strain rate in rocks undergoing brittle creep deformation, cited by the operators of the Groningen gas field in developing their operational earthquake forecasting model due to time\-dependent creep compaction in the reservoir **\[5.8\]**.

 4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Routes to Impact: The main route to impact was the ICEF report by Jordan et al. \(2011, doi: 10.4401/ag\-5350\), where Main was one of three principal members of the writing team, and which cites 5 of Main’s papers since 2000, including **\[3.2\]** and **\[3.3\]**. The ICEF report summarised the state of the art in OEF, and developed protocols for its application in risk assessment and communication. It prompted multi\-national developments in public policy and service provision related to earthquake risk reduction that continue to this day. Impact from the research also arises from Main’s role as external reviewer to the operators of the Groningen gas field \(NAM\) in developing their OEF model and to the Dutch Bureau of Mines \(SODM\) in regulating hydrocarbon production at Groningen, Netherlands. 

##  Impact on Practitioners and Stakeholders: 

 Italy: The Italian National Geophysical and Volcanological Institute \(INGV\) operates a live OEF system based on the principles established in the ICEF report. This provided “ *statistically reliable and skilful space\-time\-magnitude forecasts of the largest earthquakes during the complex 2016–2017 Amatrice\-Norcia sequence*” in central Italy **\[5.1\]**. The UK Government assisted the Italian Government in responding to the Norcia\-Amatrice sequence via enhanced deployment of UK seismometers one week after the sequence started, led by Margarita Segou of the BGS, with Naylor, McCloskey and Main. The UK Cabinet Office commended our “ *contribution to the UK’s positive reputation in this area*” and confirmed our “ *proactivity was very well received by both the INGV and the Italian Government”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 New Zealand: The New Zealand Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences \(GNS\) has continued to issue operational forecasts of earthquake likelihood using the protocols established by the ICEF report. This includes 5 earthquakes since 2014, notably during the magnitude \(M\) 7.8 Kaikoura sequence in 2016, which affected the Town of Kaikoura itself, and multiple towns in central New Zealand, including on the capital city of Wellington. The OEF lead of the GNS writes “ *the New Zealand government instituted a one\-year mandatory retrofit programme for reinforced masonry in central New Zealand. The details of the programme were heavily guided by OEF information and the government contributed up to 50% of the retrofit cost.*” **\[5.3\]**. OEF has been used in New Zealand for: \(i\) Health and safety assessments for Urban Search and Rescue staff involved in the short\-term emergency response; \(ii\) Assessing the timing and suitability of resettlement or relocation by the Civil Protection agency; \(iii\) Assessing and managing the financial impact including adjustment of insurance premiums based on anticipated losses \(independently estimated at USD705,000,000 \- USD3,500,000,000 in the case of the Kaikoura sequence\); \(iv\) Recovery planning, through mandatory retrofitting of vulnerable buildings, and changes in land use planning and building design codes by Local and National Authorities; \(v\) Public information throughout the sequence. OEF has also been used to guide timeline decisions for large infrastructure projects, and private companies have used OEF for decisions about planning repair of earthquake damage and for cost\-benefit analysis for on\-going decision making during recovery time. **\[5.3\].** 

 United States **:** The US Geological Survey \(USGS\) developed a system that forecasts the probabilities and numbers of aftershocks of different sizes following domestic earthquakes, and applied it during the aftershock sequence of the 2018 Anchorage M7.1 earthquake, the 2019 M6.4\-M7.1 Ridgecrest sequence and the 2019\-2020 Puerto Rico sequence. There has been wide recognition of OEF by the public, government, media, FEMA \(the US Department of Homeland Security \- Federal Emergency Management Agency\), and others, especially during the Puerto Rico sequence in December 2019. Responding to widespread demands for forecast information, the USGS created a plain\-language document that placed the forecast in terms of ‘scenarios’, plus an analysis to estimate the likely duration of the sequence, published on 30 January 2020 and released in English and Spanish, along with an infographic summary. **\[5.4\]**. As part of this programme, the USGS received three years of support from USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to develop a product that has been provided to seismic network operators in several countries \(Mexico, Nepal, Myanmar\) allowing them to calculate and disseminate aftershock likelihoods. **\[5.5\]**. 

 Japan: The ICEF report, and its subsequent approval by the International Association of Seismology and Physics of Earth’s Interior influenced the Japanese Cabinet Office decision to suspend deterministic prediction of the Tokai earthquake by the Japanese Meteorological Authority \(JMA\) in 2018 in favour of an OEF \(continuously\-updated ‘Extra Earthquake Information’\) service for the Nankai trough. If a period of elevated hazard is detected ‘JMA convenes the Nankai Trough Earthquake Assessment Committee for discussions on the expected potential for earthquake occurrence, and issues Earthquake Extra Information to the public via the JMA website and channels such as TV and radio’. **\[5.6\]**. 

 Extension to Induced Seismicity **:** Main’s research has underpinned protocols to quantify hazards and manage risks associated with natural gas extraction in the Netherlands, in turn informing decisions by the Dutch Bureau of Mines \(SodM\), the Netherlands Government, and the field operators NAM **\[5.7\]**. NAM developed and published a model which “ *provides operational forecasts consistent with the observed space–time–magnitude distribution of earthquakes induced by gas production from the Groningen field in the Netherlands…This forecast capability allows reliable assessment of alternative control options to better inform future induced seismic risk management decisions*” \[ **\[5.8\]**, citing **\[3.6\]**\]. This has resulted in approval of production, subject to significant managed changes in field operations and a reduction in the associated risk to the public **\[5.7\]**. In January 2014, the Netherlands Government announced a planned cut in total annual production of natural gas from 53.8 billion cubic metres \(bcm\) to 40 bcm by 2016, at an estimated cost to Government revenue of EUR1,000,000,000 “ *as part of the effort to reduce the danger caused by small but damaging earthquakes*” **\[5.9\]**. Subsequent cuts, reduced actual production to 24 bcm in October 2016, as confirmed by the Council of State ruling of November 18, 2015.  In 2018 production was reduced further to 21.6 bcm of natural gas. **\[5.9\]**. 

 Impact on raising public awareness and preparedness: The ICEF report highlighted the critical importance of risk communication during a crisis, and the effective communication of the relevant issues in times of repose, so that practitioners and the general public can act in an informed way during a crisis. Accordingly, the group has also contributed significantly to the public understanding and discussion of earthquake risks through interaction with a range of media outlets in articles or interviews in international media outlets including the Guardian, Scotsman, commentary in *Nature*, and via Terra Mater’s multiple\-award\-winning documentary *Chasing Quakes* on our work in supporting INGV during the Norcia\-Amatrice sequence in 2016\-17, featuring Main and Naylor, in December 2017 **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Based on his experiences of an adult diagnosis of autism via literary and cultural studies research into autism, McGrath’s impact has led to changes in \(a\) professional awareness within the NHS of obstacles faced by autistic adults in accessing their services \(GP training films\); \(b\) changes in how health professionals accommodate the needs of autistic patients \(conference presentations; Q\+A sessions; training events\) \(c\) updating content of certified online courses on autism awareness to represent autistic perspectives \(High Speed Training UK\); \(d\) policy changes in diagnostic techniques and communication with service users; \(e\) public awareness that autistic people may succeed in Arts and Humanities, not just STEM domains as previously stereotyped \(BBC radio broadcasts; The Conversation\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 McGrath’s adult autism diagnosis was a positive experience in enabling him to understand his condition and access support. However, as a literature scholar and poet, he felt alienated by pervasive scientific as well as cultural narratives that presuppose autistic people lack empathy and imagination and have little potential in arts and humanities subjects \(Baron\-Cohen, 2001\). The stereotypes that pervade both public and professional understanding of autism leave some autistic adults less likely to receive diagnosis and support, simply because they enjoy the arts, and therefore score ‘low’ for autism characteristics on some standard diagnostic tools. 

 As a result of his experiences, McGrath undertook a concerted study of how autism is narrated across fiction, poetry, songs, television and film, as well as in leading psychiatric discourse. The resulting interdisciplinary book, *Naming Adult Autism* \(2017\) \( **3.2**\), is a cultural and medical history of the term, foregrounding the role of *narrative* in how autism is understood and diagnosed \(there are no ‘biological’ tests available\). 

 McGrath evaluates the context of Nazi ideology surrounding Hans Asperger’s 1944 study, showing how the Austrian paediatrician’s publications foregrounded his patients’ most culturally valuable talents: gifts in STEM \(Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths\). McGrath traces how Asperger shaped subsequent psychiatric expectations that autistic people may succeed in STEM areas but show little understanding of the arts \(Baron\-Cohen, 2001\). He highlights how this dehumanizing assumption about autistic people also shapes \(and sensationalises\) the condition’s portrayal across film, television, popular music \(see also **3.1**\) and fiction. Cautioning against the term ‘representation’ when critiquing these cultural manifestations of the condition, McGrath shows how psychiatry and culture mutually conflate stereotypes of autistic ‘minds wired for science’ \(Baron\-Cohen, 2012\) with little reference to the real experiences of autistic adults \(and still less consideration that autistic people might engage with these texts\). 

 The world’s most widely\-disseminated autism questionnaire – used as both a diagnostic screening tool and the basis for the UK’s ongoing Channel 4/ *PLOS\-One* national survey of autistic traits – is Baron\-Cohen’s ‘Adult Autism Quotient Test’ \(2001\). *Naming Adult Autism* calls for this to be withdrawn from use by GPs and updated for use in national surveys. McGrath uncovers flaws in the test’s methodology and scoring, and hence its reliability. The questionnaire was created to help GPs decide whether to refer adults for autism assessment. Yet it served a simultaneous purpose: to support lucrative theories that mathematicians and scientists show more autistic traits than the general population. Answers suggesting an interest in numeracy are scored to raise the likelihood of autism – but answers indicating enjoyment of the arts are scored *negatively.* This major test and survey excludes creativity and imagination from the profile of what autism ‘means’. 

 McGrath traces the history of autism narratives from Asperger to the present, before contemplating its possible futures. If ‘preventing’ autism becomes possible via prenatal screening, the ways in which the condition is narrated in culture, as well as science, could influence decisions on abortion. Critical study of autism narratives is thus vital. Using literary critical approaches to both scientific and cultural texts, *Naming Adult Autism* seeks to promote further interdisciplinary studies of the subject. McGrath has sought wider audiences for his published research \( **3.3**\) because it is urgent that wider constituencies understand the breadth of the autism continuum, and the damaging nature of narrow stereotypes about the condition.

 The **significance** of McGrath’s study of autism is that is the first cultural history of autism from the cultural field; it is therefore also **original.** Its **rigour** is signalled by its appearance from an academic press \(which had a process of peer review as part of its publication\), and its influence on discourses outside the immediate field of literary and cultural studies \(for instance medicine and allied professions – e.g. a positive review in the *BMJ*\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

1.  **Developing Professional Awareness; \(b\) Changes in Professional Practice; \(c\) Updating of Professional training Materials** 

 McGrath has presented his work in a number of different forums. A Leeds Cultural Conversation hosted by the CCA at Leeds Beckett in December 2017 \( [https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/events/past\-events/2016/faculty\-events/lcc\-james\-mcgrath/](https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/events/past-events/2016/faculty-events/lcc-james-mcgrath/)\) was one of the early outings for the book, but earlier iterations had been presented to patient and service\-user groups and to health professionals. He has also worked with this organisation to improve other elements of their practice, showing how **their use of children’s toys in adult autism diagnostic assessments** was highly problematic in diagnosing the condition in adults and modifying their practice, so that adults with autism are less humiliated by diagnosis, and more likely to come forward. He has also participated in training films for LADS \( **4.1**\) – an online resource for GPs and other health professionals in the Leeds City region \(2018\). And in 2017 he was instrumental in influencing **modifications in the content and style the Leeds NHS Trust’s Autism Awareness online course** \(High Speed Training\). As a result of his research he was also asked to join the Service Users Group for LADS to advocate for other adult autistic people. 

 **\(d\) Policy changes in diagnostic techniques and communication with clients** 

 In 2017, The Leeds Autism Diagnostic Service \(LADS\) responded to McGrath’s research, bought copies of his book as a training resource, and, though we cannot demonstrate a causal link, subsequently **changed one of their key practices – they abandoned the use of the Baron Cohen Autism Quotient Questionnaire from their diagnostic suite \(4.7\)**. 

 In February 2016, while the book was still in preparation, McGrath presented to the Leeds and York Partnership NHS Trust, Autism Conference to the title ‘What is it like to be autistic?’ This presentation, given to an audience of NHS staff, combined personal reflections with academic research **. It was announced at the conference that following McGrath’s critical observations of how clients are informed of diagnoses** \(with clients being ‘copied in’ to letters to their GPs\), **Leeds Autism Diagnostic Services were amending this policy, making both clients **and** GPs the nominal recipients of diagnostic confirmations.** This matters because it means that adults with autism are being *as* adults, and directly addressed by the health professionals concerned. 

 **\(e\) Public awareness of the artistic and creative potential of people with autism** 

 McGrath has also set out to work with wider publics than the health professional domain. On 6 December 2017, he participated in an hour\-long discussion of his book with Kelly\-Anne Watson of Leeds Beckett Student Union. This talk was attended by members of the public as well as students and staff. The following day his Leeds Cultural Conversation – a public lecture, brokered in partnership with Leeds City Council and Palgrave’s Campaign for the Humanities was well attended, and has garnered 1,460 views on the YouTube archive of the footage. **Extracts from this talk were used by LADS in their film suite of training materials \(4.4\)** – see above. He has also appeared on BBC Radio Leeds to discuss autism in culture \(April 2016, and December 2017\). And he was an invited panellist at *Autism Writes Back\!*, part of the International Literature Showcase \(sponsored by Arts Council England, British Council and Writers’ Centre Norwich\) at the 2018 Norfolk and Norwich Festival. His April 2019 article for *The Conversation* \( [https://theconversation.com/not\-all\-autistic\-people\-are\-good\-at\-maths\-and\-science\-despite\-the\-stereotypes\-114128](https://theconversation.com/not-all-autistic-people-are-good-at-maths-and-science-despite-the-stereotypes-114128) \) has been widely read, including by **Professor Simon Baron Cohen – who tweeted that he agreed with McGrath’s premise** \( [https://twitter.com/sbaroncohen/status/1114060989333483520](https://twitter.com/sbaroncohen/status/1114060989333483520)\) 

 In October and November 2019, building on this work with LADS, McGrath was also a speaker at two face\-to\-face training events for Leeds GPs and for other health professionals about the need to refocus some elements of standard practice and the damage done by the cultural stereotype of the STEM\-focused autistic male. Assessments from these events suggest that the individuals encountering McGrath’s work were overwhelmingly likely to change their perspective and practices as a result . \(See  [https://www.andrewsimscentre.nhs.uk/assets/downloads/programme\-1568798579.pdf](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.andrewsimscentre.nhs.uk%2Fassets%2Fdownloads%2Fprogramme-1568798579.pdf&data=02%7C01%7CR.Robbins%40leedsbeckett.ac.uk%7Cc9017bbbe7dd429bc83808d742870062%7Cd79a81124fbe417aa112cd0fb490d85c%7C0%7C0%7C637051020424730847&sdata=0UC6UWkf5BZNaT2EaASxPh5%2BKk04nE8RHQYD1Wlu%2FFg%3D&reserved=0)\) 

 In short, McGrath’s work has built public awareness of autism as a range of conditions which defy the maths\-geek stereotype, and of the need to look more widely at what the condition means for those who have it. The public awareness matters, but the more important impact is that he has also worked with practitioners in the Leeds City Region to modify their practices to better serve their users, and as a result his work has changed professional practices.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The number of people worldwide with limb loss is increasing, with over 1.6 million in the US alone and 185,000 amputations every year. NTU research on advanced prosthetic hydraulic ankles and microprocessor\-controlled knee devices demonstrated improved patient mobility and quality of life. NTU research impacts have increased sales of Blatchford Ltd’s hydraulic ankle devices, including making it the preferred \[text removed for publication\] prescription option, and changed clinical practice improving patient’s clinical outcomes. Blatchford Ltd have used NTU’s research outcomes as research evidence for Medical Device Regulation compliance requirements, in white papers used for product promotion, sales and marketing, and tendering for clinical contracts, and in training at clinical sites in 52 countries. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Incidence of limb loss worldwide is increasing. The 1.6 million people living with limb loss in the United States in 2008 was predicted to double by 2050. In the UK, the leading causes of amputation occurring in adults over 50 years are diabetes and/or peripheral vascular disease. Therefore, most new referrals to prosthetics centres \(6,000 annually in the UK\) involve older patients with health comorbidities. Although prosthetic device prescription is a key determinant of an individual’s long\-term health outlook and quality of life, they typically receive functionally basic prosthetic devices. Research is lacking relating to the efficacy of advanced prosthetic devices that have the potential to improve mobility and quality of life in prosthesis users. This prevents the widespread provision of more advanced devices, as awareness and prescription of these devices must be based upon their clinical efficacy. To address this issue, Barnett \(from NTU’s Exercise and Health Research Group, in our *Sport, Health and Performance Enhancement Research Centre*\) has led work with Blatchford, a multi\-award winning, world\-leading prosthetic device manufacturer, since 2016. The research underpinning this case study has been supported with significant in\-kind contributions from Blatchford \(£80,495 to date\) and has been conducted in collaboration with NHS Trusts and both academic and commercial colleagues. 

 Blatchford supported \(staff time, prosthetic devices\) an NTU\-led cohort study which was the first in the world to quantitatively establish mobility improvements when using hydraulic ankle devices in transtibial prosthesis users with lower activity levels \( **R1**\). Participants walked further during clinical walking tests, with a more even distribution of limb loading and improved gait progression, when using a hydraulic ankle device compared to using a routinely prescribed rigid non\-articulating device. This impact on patient mobility is highly significant given any improvement in mobility leading to increased quality of life is positive in a patient group with low mobility levels and associated health issues. These results confirmed findings from an earlier study, which showed that a prosthetic device's mechanical function consistently has a meaningful impact on gait \( **R2**\). This meant that clinicians could make effective decisions regarding prosthetic prescription based on a gait evaluation from a single session. 

 Further funded patient surveys and public consultation was conducted to shape the research programme and increase the magnitude of patient impact \( **G1**\). This led to a multi\-centre randomised feasibility trial called STEPFORWARD, funded by the National Institute for Health Research \( **R3**, **G2**\). Led by Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, it involved four universities and three NHS Trusts; Barnett was a co\-investigator, a member of the Nottingham site research team and Trial Management Group member. Advanced prosthetic devices such as hydraulic ankles and microprocessor\-controlled knee devices are available within some healthcare systems internationally. Despite demonstrating the positive impact of hydraulic ankles on mobility \( **R1**, **R2**\) there was still a need to demonstrate their effectiveness and cost effectiveness vs. the standard basic devices routinely prescribed, in order for them to become part of standard care. For the trial, 55 participants were randomised across five sites. Whilst in the intervention \(hydraulic ankle\) group, quality of life scores increased, quality of life scores remained the same in the control group. Walking distances in the two\-minute test increased by 7.8 m in the intervention group, compared with a *decrease* of 10.8m in the control group, and sedentary time decreased by 114 minutes in the intervention group compared with a smaller decrease of 34 minutes in the control group. A key outcome was that the study procedures proved feasible and acceptable to both participants and professionals delivering the study. 

 The success of the aforementioned projects related to hydraulic ankle provision in people with transtibial limb loss, convinced Blatchford to support further research in\-kind at NTU \( **G3**\) focussing on transfemoral prosthesis users. An initial case study led by the University of Salzburg, in which NTU’s Barnett was a co\-investigator, was the first to demonstrate that during slope walking, intact limb hip joint loading was reduced when using a hydraulic ankle device in combination with a microprocessor\-controlled knee, compared to a non\-articulating ankle device \( **R4**\). This is significant as the hip and lower back are common sites of pain, discomfort and osteoarthritis for transfemoral prosthesis users. A full scale investigation, led by Barnett, into the effects of prosthetic knee and ankle component combination use on the function and performance in transfemoral prosthesis users, demonstrated that the combination of a hydraulic ankle and microprocessor\-controlled knee, resulted in improved mobility during clinical mobility tests, when compared to less advanced combinations of prosthetic devices \( **R5**\). Beyond demonstrating improving patient mobility and well\-being, NTU’s research is highly relevant for countries with insurance\-based healthcare systems such as the USA. There, clinical evidence informs the eligibility of claimants for more advanced prosthetic devices. Without these demonstrable benefits, these claims may be denied.

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Prior to studies led by and involving Barnett at NTU, there was limited evidence of the clinical efficacy and cost\-effectiveness of advanced, self\-aligning hydraulic ankle devices, compared with the basic standard devices routinely prescribed to transtibial prosthesis users with lower activity levels. The benefits of combining a hydraulic ankle device with a microprocessor\-controlled knee device were also undocumented. Barnett’s studies have increased provision of these advanced devices for the improvement of mobility in lower limb prosthesis users, leading to commercial benefits for prosthetics manufacturers and distributors, changes to clinicians’ prescribing practices and increased patient satisfaction. 

 **Economic impacts via improved commercial performance of a world\-leading prosthetics manufacturer and across the wider industry.** 

 Blatchford Ltd is a world\-leading international prosthetic device designer, manufacturer and rehabilitation provider. Headquartered in the UK where its manufacturing operation is based, the company has nine office locations around the world including Russia, US and India. The self\-aligning hydraulic ankle device used in Barnett’s studies was the Avalon<sup>K2</sup>, a commercially available ankle device manufactured by Blatchford, who also own the trademark and patent rights. The outcomes of the clinical studies at NTU \( **G3**\) have directly resulted in the commercial impacts benefiting Blatchford detailed below, including:  ensuring its marketing strategy is based on peer\-reviewed scientific evidence, increasing sales revenues and enabling the company to comply with stricter medical device regulations governing one of its largest markets \( **S1**\). 

 **Marketing strategy impacts**:** Blatchford’s director of research and technology wrote: ‘ *We take an evidence\-based approach to product promotion and place science at the core of all our activities. Dr Barnett’s work has helped us maintain that strategy in several important areas*’ \( **S1**\). The research related to the hydraulic ankle devices \( **R1**, **R2**\) has been cited in six key documents produced by Blatchford to market its products, such as the Avalon<sup>K2</sup> hydraulic ankle device and communicate the evidence underpinning their efficacy. For example, in November 2018 ‘ *a white paper titled, ""A Study of AvalonK2 "", of which Dr. Barnett's research constituted a key part, was downloaded 400 unique times in its first year. It has been extremely well received*’ \( **S1**\). This paper outlined the benefits of hydraulic ankle devices for prosthesis users with lower activity levels, including Barnett’s conclusions around increased walking speed \( **S1**, **S2**\). Research papers \( **R1**, **R2**\) were also cited in Blatchford’s 2020 White Paper looking at the clinical benefits of hydraulic ankle devices more widely; one paper \( **R1**\) was cited in the company’s product brochure for Avalon<sup>K2</sup>; other papers \( **R1**, **R2**, **R4\)** were cited in Blatchford’s ‘clinical compendium’ for hydraulic ankle\-foot products \( **S3**\). Dr Barnett's research used in commercial documentation has helped “ *provide a key part of the training and education of \[the company’s\] staff both at the company’s UK headquarters and distributors around the world*” \( **S1**\). 

 **Contract awards and increased sales revenues impacts**:** Barnett’s research has led directly to an increase in Blatchford’s sales revenues from its hydraulic ankle products, ‘ *The research conducted by Dr. Barnett and its wide\-reaching impact, has almost certainly led to an increase in the sales of our hydraulic ankle products*’ \( **S1**\). Specific examples are provided \[text removed for publication\]. 

 **Regulatory compliance impacts**:** New EU Regulations for Medical Devices came into force in May 2017, imposing stricter requirements for the provision of clinical evidence to demonstrate user benefits. Implementation was planned for May 2020 but was delayed a year due to the onset of the COVID\-19 pandemic. To meet the May deadline, Blatchford submitted Clinical Evaluation Reports for the Avalon<sup>K2</sup> for which Barnett’s research \( **R1**, **R2**, **R4**\) was a key source. Blatchford described Barnett’s research contribution as ‘ *of extremely high importance* *in the R&D department, as it is used as part of the clinical evidence in the Clinical Evaluation Reports*’, a requirement for ensuring Medical Device Regulations compliance and thus enabling the company to continue accessing one of its important markets and maintain its global\-leading position \( **S1**\). 

 **Clinical impact via improvement to evidence\-based professional development and changes to clinicians’ prescription practices.** 

 **Impacts on professional development and training:* Blatchford is a supplier of clinical services, such as rehabilitation and prosthetic provision, to national health services, the military and private sector providers and, as such, clinical education is a key component of its business model. For example, they provide 400,000 appointments annually at 23 NHS prosthetic clinics and five private clinics across the UK alone. Their Principal Prosthetist and Commercial Manager referred to papers \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R5**\) and commented, ‘ *I have engaged with Dr. Barnett’s research through such direct contact as well as journal publications and the conference presentations*’ \( **S4**\), and followed with, ‘ *I have used the research as a key part of the training and education I provide to our staff both at our UK headquarters and clinical sites in 52 countries around the world. For example, I have used the research and commercial documentation to train prosthetists in the fitting and adjustment of prostheses and to solve complex clinical cases. I have recently conducted four webinar series on these components \(May 2020\) that was attended by 309 people from 35 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Germany, India, Israel, Portugal, South Africa and Singapore*’ \( **S4**\). 

 **Impacts on changes to clinicians’ prescription practices**:** Barnett’s research has informed clinicians’ decision\-making relating to prosthetic devices and changed their prescribing practices. One prosthetist \( **S5**\), who is responsible for fitting patients with new prosthetic legs and sees around 100 patients with lower limb amputation wrote that \(specifically referring to\) Barnett’s research *‘has resulted in me changing my clinical practices and I supply more hydraulic ankles to my patients*’ and added that these changes ‘ *have also* *benefitted my patients’ clinical outcomes in terms of mobility and quality of life*.’ The clinical lead for an NHS prosthetic clinic at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, with around 800 patients, said \(specifically referring to\) Barnett’s research ‘ *has resulted in me altering the centre prescription guidelines*’ which has ‘ *led to the prescription of more hydraulic ankles*’, adding that ‘ *these changes in my clinical practice have also benefitted my patients’ clinical outcomes in terms of mobility and quality of life*’ \( **S6**\). \[text removed for publication\]. Blatchford confirmed the global clinical impact of the research: ‘ *Dr. Barnett’s work is influencing prescription of devices throughout the world enabling access to more advanced technologies for lower activity amputees* \( **S1**\).’ 

 **Improved trial patient satisfaction, mobility and health outcomes.** 

 This Avalon<sup>K2</sup> device was also used in the NIHR project \( **G2**\) and associated *STEPFORWARD* trial, for which “ *Blatchford and Sons have had no part in the study design, nor are they involved directly in the research, its subsequent analysis and ultimate dissemination*” \( **S3**\) in order to maintain the independence of the trial. Results from NTU’s research contributions to the *STEPFORWARD* trial have demonstrated that more advanced prosthetic devices lead to better outcomes for patients \( **S8**\). Twenty\-seven patients benefitted from using the self\-aligning ankle device for the *STEPFORWARD* trial and all of them decided to keep the prosthesis at the end of it, indicating that they preferred it to a standard device and that it enhanced their ability to move around and their quality of life \( **S8**\). According to the final report submitted to the NIHR \( **S8**\): ‘ *Some participants described how they felt more mobile in terms of using stairs, the ease of going on slopes, and walking on different surfaces. The transformation was sometimes immediate. Participants acknowledged that they still needed to be careful, but they felt overwhelmingly more confident when moving around*.’ This was corroborated by statements from the study participants themselves. On being provided with the new ankle device, one participant said *‘You felt the difference as soon as they put the foot on and I stood up and walked. There was just no pressure in the knee, none in the hip and no pain at all…it was a lot better walking. It’s more comfortable’* \( **S9**\). Another participant noted *‘I’m not walking stiff. I’m walking like a normal person now’* with a further participant stating, *‘I don’t know what the price difference is but this \(new ankle\) is so much better and if you were learning to walk on one, this would be so much better to learn to walk on one’* \( **S9**\). The ankle device also became integral parts of people’s lives, with a study participant exclaiming ‘ *you can’t have this \(new ankle\) leg back\!*’ \( **S9**\). One comment from a *STEPFOWARD* trial participant reflects the large personal impact the research has on the individual *‘It’s really changed my life doing the study and made it all better’* \( **S9**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Statistical Testing \(ST\) of systems, developed by Dr May and his team at the University of Bristol, has provided a scientific basis for increased confidence in new control & instrumentation \(C&I\) software for the UK nuclear energy sector. Crucial to the future of nuclear power, the software performs critical safety functions, and its reliability must be demonstrated. Traditional techniques are unable to do this, thus May and his team developed ST to fill the gap and provide the key evidence necessary to support the licensing of this increasingly complex software. During the REF2021 impact period, ST has: \(i\) become a key component in the governance and regulation of critical nuclear systems, including within Office for Nuclear Regulation guidance and nuclear licensees’ practice; \(ii\) been incorporated into EDF infrastructure and expertise; and \(iii\) stimulated nuclear C&I policy analysis and review in national and international government and industry bodies.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 For all nuclear technologies, and particularly after events such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, independent and robust demonstration of safety is paramount, and is required to obtain an operating licence. New nuclear plants use significantly more programmable \(software based\) digital C&I than previous generations. Such C&I is more complex, and it is relied on to a greater extent to keep the public safe. However, traditional random failure reliability models, originally developed for hardware, cannot be used to assess programmable systems, because the design \(also called ‘systematic’\) software failures exhibit a different type of randomness. 

 Dr John May and his research group at the University of Bristol \(UoB\) have advanced ST to provide a new approach to the reliability assurance of programmable digital systems. It is a form of what the industry calls ‘software substantiation’ and is unique in two respects: it applies the scientific method \(it is empirical testing of software design\), and it generates a scientifically defensible reliability estimate. It therefore provides very strong support for regulator confidence in critical software. 

 The research was conducted within UoB’s South West Nuclear Hub \( [https://southwestnuclearhub.ac.uk/](https://southwestnuclearhub.ac.uk/)\) , for the most part funded by the C&I Nuclear Industry Forum \(CINIF\), the UK’s leading body responsible for advancing nuclear C&I safety in the UK. CINIF funded the research, led by Dr May, within the Hub’s “System Reliability, Resilience, Security & Risk” theme, continuously between 2001\-2017. Papers \[1\]\-\[6\] all derive from this programme, the results of which are disseminated to CINIF members \(UK nuclear licensees and regulators\) \[A\] \[C\]. 

 Specifically, from 2001 to 2004, May, Kuball and Hughes showed how ST tests can be defined to simultaneously satisfy reliability targets and traditional test adequacy \(coverage\) criteria \[1\]. This was important because code coverage was and remains an important aim of software testing. The ST was applied to a software system for turret control which had already been tested using industry standard techniques. This found all faults uncovered by the standard techniques and additional faults not discovered previously, demonstrating for the first time the power of ST in a real application \[2\], and persuading nuclear engineers in industry and the regulator of its power and value. 

 Between 2004 and 2007, the research evolved to accommodate a trend in C&I, namely, increasing use of ‘smart devices’ with embedded software. May and Kuball were the first to solve the underlying research problems and hence demonstrate ST in software substantiation of smart devices, thereby unlocking a scientifically defensible method for reliability assessment \[3\] \[4\]. ST samples the set of possible challenges or ‘demands’ on a system, to estimate the proportion which fail, but the research problems did not lie in the inference statistics. They concerned the need for 1\) new stochastic system environment simulation models \(e.g. of reactor accident transients\), and 2\) new ways to define system tests to achieve random sampling \(the software test methods existing at the time did not satisfy ST requirements\). Both were needed to perform ST on C&I systems, and on smart devices in particular, which is why the solutions have been able to underpin the actions of organisations performing ST, government bodies initiating ST policy synthesis, and regulators advocating ST in the guidance for assessing these systems. 

 During 2014\-2016, May and Chen advanced understanding of the reliability efficacy of software failure diversity in systems with redundant channel architectures \[5\]. Without failure diversity, the software in the channels has the potential to defeat the most fundamental system reliability design technique available to C&I engineers, namely, redundancy. Again, this is because, in contrast to hardware, software fails systematically; broadly speaking, if each channel contains identical software, then when one channel fails due to a software fault, all channels fail coincidentally. Paper \[5\] gives the fundamental theory underpinning demonstration of failure diversity by injecting faults in diversely coded software channels. 

 Finally, May and Chen produced \(2015\-2017\) a world\-first model capable of estimating system reliability based on software executing on simulated hardware platforms \[6\]. The importance of this is that simulation raises the possibility of massively concurrent testing \(hence massive test acceleration\) and is capable of breaking current limits for reliability demonstrations proposed in the literature. Equally important, it also allows design\-time estimation of reliability, by moving much of the testing prior to hardware platform availability. This is a crucial advantage because C&I testing often comes at a later stage in plant build schedules and it is necessary to de\-risk the possibilities for finding faults at this stage.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 2019, nuclear accounted for 18.4% of the UK energy supply  \( [https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications\-and\-updates/infographic\-energy\-security](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/infographic-energy-security)\) . There are 15 operating plants, at 8 sites, all operated by licensee EDF Energy \( [http://www.onr.org.uk/civil\-nuclear\-reactors/index.htm](http://www.onr.org.uk/civil-nuclear-reactors/index.htm);  [https://www.edfenergy.com/about/nuclear](https://www.edfenergy.com/about/nuclear)\). The UK intends to maintain a significant level of nuclear power production to provide a baseline carbon neutral energy source for the UK. This will require the construction of new plants, possibly including small/advanced modular reactor designs, as well as modifications to extend the life of existing plants. In all cases, software C&I plays an important safety role, hence the significant impact that UoB’s ST research has had on policy described in sections 4.1\-4.3. In REF 2014, Dr May and his team articulated the impact of their pioneering use of ST to substantiate key critical control and instrumentation \(C&I\) systems, such as protection \(shutdown\) systems. Sections 4.1\-4.3 describe new impacts for REF 2021. 

###  4.1 Changes to regulatory policy and safety guidance lead to improved confidence in the safety of UK nuclear systems 

 The Superintending Inspector for Nuclear Safety at the Office for Nuclear Regulation \(ONR\) stated: “ *The work of Dr May’s research group on ST \[…\] made important contributions to our understanding that ST is effective in terms of more familiar test adequacy criteria \(statistical testing is not a traditional or common form of software testing\) and to demonstrate how it can be applied to smart devices. With its capability to provide a scientifically defensible reliability estimate for software systems, it has enhanced scientific rigour in the assurance of complex programmable electronic and software\-based systems important to safety. It has therefore provided the nuclear industry sector with a method of demonstrating high quality additional evidence in support of licensing nuclear plants and/or modification to safety systems containing increasingly complex C&I systems that can be assessed by ONR. This research has been a major factor supporting ONR’s decision to recommend the use of ST as part of the measures to justify the design of complex C&I safety systems and equipment in guidance, namely Technical Assessment Guide \(TAG\) NS\-TAST\-GD\-046 revision \(commonly referred to as TAG 046\), and therefore within nuclear licensees’ practice. In addition, it was incorporated into ONR’s Safety Assessment Principles \(SAPs\) that form our highest level of technical policy that reflects relevant good practice in the nuclear sector…*” \[A\] 

 The ONR publications rely mainly on standards, and rarely contain academic references \(although TAG 046 does cite paper \[5\] as a specialist research source\). It also references international standard IEC61508\-7 “Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety\-related systems”, which cites \[4\] on this topic in Section C5.1. Dr May has also provided direct input to TAG 046, most recently in 2018, giving guidance to ONR on ST and coding practices to support ST, which was included in clauses 9.26 and 10.26\-10.29 \[A\]. As a result of his contributions, in 2015, Dr May was invited to sit on the ONR Chief Inspector’s Independent Advisory Panel to advise on C&I policy and remains a member to date \[A\]. 

 The impact of ST resulting from its inclusion in the SAPs \(from 2014\), TAG 046 and the IEC61508\-7 is exemplified by two important changes in the nuclear landscape: 

 a. <ins>The UK New Nuclear Build \(NNB\) programme</ins> – All new projects in this programme will follow the ONR guidance regarding ST. EDF’s NNB 2017 plans for assurance of C&I for their EPR reactor at the new Sizewell C and Hinkley C nuclear plants states: “ *There is a statistical testing programme for the HPC EPR Protection System \(covering the Protection System Core as well as the Protection System Interface Units\) \[…\] It is proposed to run 50,000 tests on the final software release, which will provide a 99% confidence level…*” \[B\]. Similar plans were created for assurance of Hitachi’s protection system on their ABWR in 2015 \[C\], and Westinghouse’s AP1000 reactor protection in 2017 \[D\]. 

 b. <ins>The widespread use of Smart Devices in new nuclear systems</ins> – Research conducted by May and Kuball \[3\] \[4\] was the first to show how to perform ST on smart instruments, enabling the ONR to extend their guidance to include the use of ST on this type of equipment. This policy is a major increase in the scope of application of ST, to a significantly broader class of C&I systems. Although these devices were used occasionally in existing reactor designs \(often to replace obsolescent sensors\), they are used extensively in new reactor designs, including in safety functions. May’s work has increased the scientific rigour used in the assurance of such equipment \[A, B\]. “ *ONR now considers that the application of ST principles \[forms\] a key part of its regulatory expectations and is increasingly seen as relevant good practice in GB to provide assurance of safety for Class 1 \(the most safety significant\) and Class 2 safety systems that can incorporate smart devices in accordance with BS IEC 61226. The use of ST in this context also forms a part of the requirements within relevant international standards, including BS IEC 60080 and BS IEC 61508.*” \[A\]. In response to this impact on UK regulation, EDF have stated how May’s research has informed their own policy on smart device testing in new plants and creation of a smart device test harness. *“\[EDF\] have invested considerable internal resource on this due to the importance we believe statistical testing will have in future reliability assurance of smart devices and thus in support to safety cases”*. \[B\] 

 ST has now appeared in assurance plans of nuclear companies \[B, C and D\], demonstrating the impact of ST on the nuclear industry. 

###  4.2 ST incorporated in EDF infrastructure and expertise 

 On May’s research, EDF state: “ *The UK intends to maintain a significant level of nuclear production as a carbon neutral energy source, including construction of new plants and modifications to extend the life of existing plants. In both cases, software control & instrumentation \(C&I\) plays an important safety role. Statistical Testing \(ST\) has given us key additional evidence needed for regulatory approval of these increasingly complex systems.*” \[B\] As a result, EDF have engaged in development activities to support an increased role for ST. 

 May and Kuball’s research on performing ST on smart devices \[3\] \[4\] motivated CINIF to sponsor the construction of a smart device test harness: “ *New nuclear plants will make much greater use of smart devices in safety\-related functions, compared to older generations of nuclear plants. \[…\] smart device substantiation is expected to be required on a large scale into the future. Statistical testing is a technique that will be required to support this. The demonstration of feasibility of conducting ST on smart devices \[…\] led CINIF to sponsor the construction of a smart device test harness. This is a tool designed for industry use, to make it easier to perform ST on a wide range of devices/systems. Development of this test rig has recently been completed and is intended to be made available to all CINIF licensees. \[…\] EDF Energy NG took a leading role in this development and we have invested considerable internal resource on this due to the importance we believe statistical testing will have in future reliability assurance of smart devices and thus in support to safety cases. It is intended to interface with efforts underway at AMRC \[Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre\] on a smart device test rig, this was funded by BEIS and Dr. May contributed to the workstream associated with this*” \[B\]. EDF Energy also created a new role to lead ST activities within the company. The role is currently held by Dr Silke Kuball, previously a postdoctoral researcher in May’s group at UoB \[B\]. ST also finds application in existing \(cf. new\) nuclear stock. In 2014, EDF Energy published a paper detailing their use of ST on their replacement for the obsolescent Data Processing System operator alarm system at the Dungeness AGR \(Gough & Kuball 2014\), part of plant life extension, which cites references \[2\] and \[4\] and formed part of the substantiation of this system \[B\]. 

###  4.3 Stimulated review of nuclear safety policy internationally 

 ST is a significant departure from traditional practice in the nuclear sector and is only recently establishing itself in the industry and with regulatory bodies. Governments and industries with nuclear capability are commissioning programmes of investigation into ST, to inform policy. 

-  The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission \(NRC\) commissioned Brookhaven National Laboratory to evaluate “Development of Quantitative Software Reliability Models for Digital Protection Systems of Nuclear Power Plants” \(2013; \[E\]\). This cites \[2\] and \[4\], and led to further joint work by Brookhaven, Idaho National Laboratories, and the NRC that produced the US NRC report: “Development of A Statistical Testing Approach for Quantifying Safety\-Related Digital System on Demand Failure Probability” \(2017; \[E\]\), referenced two of May’s papers, including \[1\]. 

-  In South Korea, the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. are pursuing this field, e.g. \[F\] which progresses the topic of practical simulation\-based test environments, citing \[4\]. 

-  The Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of China National Nuclear Corporation, started, in 2020, to investigate the possibility of using ST for assessing software reliability. \[G\] 

 In the UK, the ONR’s concerns about smart device substantiation, and its subsequent decision to roll out ST on smart devices based on May’s research \[3\] \[4\], contributed to NIRAB’s conclusions in 2016 to include C&I and C&I safety in its list of areas identified for development to support the UK nuclear industry \[A, H\]. This led to ongoing advisory work \(led by Dr May\), commissioned for the BEIS Nuclear Innovation Programme, into future techniques for the sector, including platform simulation \(digital twin\) based testing \[6\], and diversity analysis for redundant channels \[5\] \[I\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Great War inspired global efforts to memorialize its tremendous sacrifices and reflect on how the war changed the course of history. The importance of the centenary prompted Strachan to re\-examine core assumptions and historical interpretations of the war and publish a series of outputs reflecting these findings. His new research shed light on how WWI became an intractable and genuinely global conflict, how the very notions of battle and strategy were transformed by the war, and the importance of the American contributions to hastening victory. Facilitated by his leading roles on the Scottish National Committee on the Centenary of the First World War and the UK National Committee for the Centenary of the First World War, Strachan’s research findings had a profound impact on the creation of UK memorialization activities—enriching our cultural heritage and shaping understandings of the Great War for generations to come. An estimated 35,000,000 people across the UK participated in these events while millions more around the world watched the live BBC coverage. 

 Specifically, the research findings: 

1.  Helped broaden centenary events to be more inclusive and international, particularly the 2016 commemorations of Jutland and the Somme; 

1.  Shaped battle commemorations to span months instead of a single day, especially for the Somme \(2016\), Passchendaele \(2017\), and Amiens \(2018\); 

1.  Led to special emphasis being placed on the Anglo\-French relationship, culminating in a special event in London in 2018 to mark the centenary of Marshal Foch’s appointment of Supreme Allied Commander. 

1.  Led to the dedication of specific memorial events recognizing American sacrifices, such as the 2018 commemorations on the Island of Islay to remember the 600 American troops lost in the sinking of the SS Tuscania and HMS Otranto. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research has been carried out since Strachan joined the University of St. Andrews in 2015, as the Bishop Wardlaw Professor in the School of International Relations. The centenary and the importance of its memorialization prompted Strachan, long a preeminent scholar of the Great War, to re\-examine core assumptions and historical interpretations of the war. The requirements to offer advice and deliver lectures, combined with the opportunity to learn from others in the process, prompted him to fundamentally rethink his approaches to a number of issues, particularly those generated by the war’s later stages. Because of the intertwined pattern of public engagement with further research and writing, research was developed, presented and refined during commemoration events and then ultimately published. Strachan’s research sheds new light on how WWI became an intractable and genuinely global conflict, how the very notion of strategy was transformed by the war and the importance of the American contributions to hastening victory. 

1.  <ins>How WWI Became an Intractable Global Conflict</ins> 

 Recent historiography had reached a broad consensus that WWI was avoidable—a conflict that could have been averted through cabinet level diplomacy and compromise. Why then did events degenerate so rapidly into an intractable global war of peoples fighting over irreconcilable objectives? Strachan argues that hardened enmities arose as differences in politics, religion, and ideology became grafted onto the idea of the national community—a new phenomenon that had not marked 19th century wars **\[R1\]**. This helps us better understand the spiraling nature of WWI—of how societies across the globe found themselves caught up in a great conflagration over what suddenly appeared to be irreconcilable differences, leading to four years of devastation and loss. 

1.  <ins>The Transformation of Battle and Strategy during WWI</ins> 

 In the 19th century, strategy was seen as the conduct of military operations—usually the tactical planning that led to decisive battles—a business for the generals and their staffs. WWI, however, changed battles: rather than brief engagements with clear winners, they were stretched over lengthy campaigns of months that produced indecisive results **\[R2\]**. This led to a reconceptualization within the strategic studies literature: strategy was now understood as an endeavor to relate the use of war to desired political ends. To this body of strategic thought, Strachan’s work adds that fighting the drawn out battles of WWI required the mobilization of whole societies and economies as well as the management of complex alliances and global coordination across multiple fronts. This broadened the notion of strategy even further for leaders at the time, heightening the importance of alliances, especially the Anglo\-French relationship in the early stages of the war and the entry of the United States at its denouement. These developments even required new state institutions for their implementation **\[R3\]**. 

1.  <ins>Reinterpreting American Contributions to the War Effort</ins> 

 Previous scholarship argued that the American Expeditionary Force arrived ‘too late’ to impact the outcome of WWI, leading historians and publics to neglect the contribution of the U.S. Strachan argues that this is a profound mistake. Rather, American entry into the war hastened victory by its immediate effects in 1917: revalidating the legitimacy of the allied war effort as the Russian revolution challenged it; relieving pressure on the Royal Navy from German U\-boats; vigorously enforcing the naval blockade of the Central Powers; and providing much needed economic aid **\[R3, R4\]**.

Strachan’s research on the intractable global nature of WWI, the transformations it wrought to battle and strategy, and the importance within this context of American sacrifices thereby shaped broader public understandings of the Great War and enhanced our cultural heritage for generations to come. Specifically, these research findings: 

  1.  Broadened centenary events, particularly the 2016 commemorations of Jutland and the Somme, to be more inclusive and international; 

  1.  Extended the battle commemorations of the Somme \(2016\), Passchendaele \(2017\), and Amiens \(2018\) to span months instead of a single event; 

  1.  Placed special emphasis on the Anglo\-French relationship within overall planning for the centenary, culminating in the 2018 London commemoration of Marshal Foch’s appointment as Supreme Allied Commander; 

  1.  And led to the creation of specific memorial events on the Isle of Islay in 2018 to recognize the sacrifice of 600 American troops who lost their lives when the SS Tuscania and HMS Otranto sank. 

 Overall, approximately 35,000,000 people across the UK participated directly in at least one activity of the First World War Centenary Programme with millions more watching the live BBC coverage – 78% of the UK population over 14 years was estimated to be aware of the coverage **\[S2, pp.ii & 17\-18\]**. Strachan was centrally involved in designing hundreds of commemoration events for this programme, as well as for additional centenary events in France. He served in a leading role on the Scottish National Committee on the Centenary of the First World War \(WW100\), on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission \(CWGC\) chairing the 1914\-18 Committee, on the UK National Committee for the Centenary of the First World War, and on the corresponding national advisory committee for the French government \(Comité Scientifique, Mission du Centenaire de la Première Guerre Mondiale\). As attested to by the Prime Minister’s Special Representative for the Commemoration of the Centenary of the First World War, “ *Throughout, he \[Strachan\] was the government’s principal “go\-to” historian, a central player in a highly acclaimed national commemorative, diplomatic and pedagogical undertaking that is without precedent*” **\[S3\]**. 

 Through this influence, Strachan wove his new research findings into particular centenary events, as developed in the examples below. The Vice Chairman of the CWGC notes that, “ *As one of the world’s leading experts on WWI, one would have thought that Sir Hew could rely entirely on his past work, but what impressed me… was the fresh insight he provided based on further research and continuous re\-examination of our assumptions about how the war began and the way it was conducted*” **\[S4\]**. 

 \(1\) <ins>Broadening Centenary Events to Be More International and Inclusive</ins> 

 Strachan’s research on the inherently global nature of the Great War **\[R1\]** helped broaden UK planning for the centenary to be more inclusive and international. Commemorations for Jutland on Orkney \(31 May 2016\) included the British Prime Minister and the German President, as well as other dignitaries, naval representatives, and military bands from both nations **\[S1, pp. 2\-3\]**. Similarly, commemorations for the Somme began with a ceremony at the Thiepval Memorial in France \(1 July 2016\) led by the French President and members of the British Royal Family, but also inclusive of Canadian participants including the Royal Canadian Artillery brass band **\[S1, pp. 7\-18\]**. The event was attended by over 10,000 people and aired on BBC2 with 1,190,000 viewers **\[S1, pp. 19\-20\]**. The Vice Chairman of the CWGC attests that: “ *There had perhaps been some unease in Government circles about the extent to which Commonwealth nations should participate, possibly fearing accusations that Britain was still acting “imperially’. It seemed to me that Sir Hew’s research and briefings on the international nature of the war helped to allay those concerns. The result for both Jutland and the Somme were two international events watched by tens of millions of people.*” **\[S4\]** 

 \(2\) <ins>Extending Battle Commemorations to Span Months</ins> 

 As Chair of the 1914\-18 Committee of the CWGC, Strachan was directly involved in planning the  centenaries of the battles of the British empire, including Jutland \(2016\), the Somme \(2016\), Passchendaele \(2017\), and Amiens \(2018\)—all of which were UK official events—\-as well as Arras \(2017\) which was specifically marked by the Scottish government. These events stressed Strachan’s new research findings on the transformation of battle into lengthy and indecisive engagements **\[R2\]**. To recognize the extraordinary duration of these battles, and properly memorialize the sacrifices they entailed, commemorations were explicitly designed to span months—particularly on the Somme, which ultimately involved 80 separate events between July and November 2016 **\[S5\]**. The Chair of the Scottish Commemorations Panel corroborates that “ *The Centenary Commemorations of the Battles of the Somme \[2016\], of Passchendaele \[2017\] and of Amiens \[2018\] all had the mark somewhere, nationally and internationally and throughout, of Sir Hew’s remarkable and highly esteemed scholarship on how a lengthy campaign over months produced such a modest result, and he was frequently consulted thereon*.” **\[R2, S6\]** 

 \(3\) <ins>Placing Special Emphasis on the</ins> <ins>Anglo\-French Relationship</ins> 

 Moreover, Strachan’s research findings on how such lengthy battles broadened notions of strategy, heightening the importance of alliances **\[R3\]**, led to special emphasis being placed on the Anglo\-French relationship within overall planning for the centenary. Indeed, Strachan served as a bridge between the UK and French planning committees, coordinating approaches and creating special recognition for the alliance on both sides of the channel. These efforts culminated in a special event, held in London on 26 March 2018, to recognize and remember Marshal Foch, the French military leader appointed Supreme Allied Commander of the war effort **\[S7\]**. As the Prime Minister’s Special Representative attests, “ *I think it is true to say that the UK’s special efforts with the centenary of the battle of Amiens in 2018 in that city and the event in London \[2018\] to mark the centenary of Marshal Foch’s appointment as Supreme Allied Commander early that year would have struggled without Sir Hew’s influence and his stress on the importance of the Anglo\-French relationship to Entente strategy. They were both warmly received in France*.” **\[S3\]** 

 \(4\) <ins>Memorializing American Sacrifices</ins> 

 Strachan’s research on American entry into the war and their importance in hastening victory **\[R3, R4\]** shaped centenary planning through the creation of specific memorial events dedicated to American sacrifices. For example, “ *Mention must also be made of the Centenary Commemorations on the Isle of Islay of the loss of SS Tuscania and HMS Otranto in February 1918 and October 1918 respectively, with the combined loss of over 600 American troops on their way to fight in Europe. This was an opportunity to reflect Sir Hew’s research by recognizing the contributions of the United States to the war’s outcome. The Islanders of Islay… went to remarkable lengths to bury and then exhume the bodies of those young Americans for their subsequent repatriation*.” **\[S6\]** The 2018 commemoration was attended by HRH The Princess Royal and the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, among other dignitaries, with ships of four national navies lying symbolically offshore **\[S8, S9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The research of Melhuish, Siraj, Sylva and Sammons has shaped Early Years policy, provision, practice and research for two decades in the UK and beyond. Two major longitudinal studies demonstrated the long\-term benefits of early education, identified effective pedagogy, and shed light on the power of the home learning environment. The research provided the evidence to underpin UK government initiatives such as the provision of free early childhood education to millions of 2\-4 year olds, encouraging and supporting home learning, and professional development interventions based on quality scales developed by the researchers. Internationally, governments and early education providers in Australia, Norway, Japan, and Hong Kong have used the tools and findings from the research to improve the early education provision of tens of thousands of children. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Key staff from the University of Oxford’s Department of Education have been leaders of the Effective Preschool, Primary and Secondary Education study \(EPPSE 1997\-2016, known as EPPE until 2007\) since its inception. EPPSE, and the follow\-up Study of Early Education and Development \(SEED 2012\-present\), on which Professor Melhuish is the academic lead, demonstrate the long\-term impact of Early Childhood Education \(ECE\) and the early Home Learning Environment \(HLE\) on educational and social development. Four strands of findings have led to impact: 

 **Strand A \-** Effectiveness of ECE in improving children’s outcomes, age 2\-4.* 

 The innovative longitudinal EPPSE study was the largest in Europe, following the developmental trajectories of more than 3,000 children in England, to investigate the effects of different types of ECE on children’s outcomes at school entry **\(R1\)** and follow up across different phases to the end of schooling **\(R3, R5\)**. EPPSE showed that children who attended preschool education made a stronger start to school, that they continued to make accelerated progress throughout primary education, and that they showed academic advantage \(compared to children without ECE\) at the end of compulsory schooling along with social\-behavioural benefits. It also revealed advantages of starting at age two. 

 **Strand B –** Home Learning Environment \(HLE\) influences on children’s development* 

 Through interviews with over 3000 parents, EPPSE identified daily activities in the home that best supported later progress. EPPSE devised a new measure of the ‘early years HLE’ that measured specific strategies that predicted subsequent progress in school according to baseline measures **\(R4\)**. HLE scores were more accurate predictors of children’s progress than standard socio\-economic status \(SES\) or income measures and had additional effects when SES and income controlled and long term HLE effects on outcomes were identified **\(R5\)**. 

 **Strand C \-** Effects of ECE quality on children’s developmental outcomes \(short and long term\)* 

 EPPSE demonstrated that high\-quality provision of ECE, including intentional teaching and planned support for social\-emotional development, had lasting effects on children’s outcomes up to the end of compulsory schooling and that those effects had measurable financial returns **\(R3\)**. Subsequent research also showed positive effects of high\-quality provision of ECE on children’s outcomes in Australia **\(R2\)** and that high\-quality ECE produced better outcomes for disadvantaged children **\(R5\)**. 

 **Strand D \-** Improving the ECE workforce: the use of research tools as the evidence\-base for successful Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\)* 

 Further research indicates the Oxford\-designed Early Childhood Environment Rating\-Scale Extension \(ECERS E\) **\(R1\)** and Sustained Shared Thinking and Emotional Well\-being \(SSTEW\) **\(R2, R6\)** scales have predictive validity for better outcomes. These are now being used across the UK and internationally in research studies and pre/schools to improve practice. Using these research\-based observational tools, practitioners were able to identify effective practice in their own centres and thereby improve the quality of their teaching and children’s developmental outcomes **\(R2, R6\)**. These tools developed initially to measure quality in EPPSE \(ECERS\-E\) and its follow\-up study SEED \(SSTEW\) are used successfully as the core of programmes for CPD. 

 The EPPE and EPPSE projects have between them received over GBP8,000,000 in funding from the Department of Education and its predecessors over the past 20 years, and additional funding has been provided by the Sutton Trust.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The pathways to impact, which were embedded into the design of the underpinning research, occurred through the creation of evidence\-based training for practitioners centred on the research findings/methods, collaborative research with practitioners, participation in government policy working groups in all UK countries, and advice to governments in high\- and low\-income countries. 

###  Early Childhood Education \(ECE\) and free part\-time education for 2 year olds. 

 In September 2013 the Department for Education \(DfE\) launched a GBP534,000,000 funding programme to extend free part\-time early education places to 2\-year\-olds in disadvantaged families. This extended its 2004 initiative offering universal free part\-time education for every child over the age of three. The Director of Evidence at the Early Intervention Foundation stated that EPPSE research ‘ *directly influenced the government’s introduction of the 2\-year\-old offer for disadvantaged families*’ **\(E1\)**. In particular, the DfE consultation paper regarding the proposed changes cited EPPSE findings that *‘high quality early education can have a profound impact on social mobility’,* and the SEED study, stating that *‘given the lower starting point among disadvantaged children, and reduced likelihood to take up childcare, early education is particularly important for this group’* **\(E2\)**. A DfE review of the pilot noted that ** **‘**The detailed policy …was strongly influenced by research evidence’* including EPPE **\(E3\)**. From 2014 this covered the 40% most disadvantaged families in the UK, over 400,000 children a year. In 2018, the then Minister for Children & Families stated that since its introduction nearly 750,000 2\-year olds had benefited from the entitlement to 15 hours of free early education a week **\(E4\)**. As well as its direct influence on ECE policy, the research has shaped research projects undertaken by the government\-funded Early Intervention Foundation, thereby influencing local and national policy and practice through that body’s engagement with the DfE and the Local Government Association **\(E1\)**. 

###  The Home Learning Environment \(HLE\) 

 The Home Learning Environment is the physical home and the interactions in and around the home which implicitly and explicitly support a child’s learning **\(E5\)**. HLE initiatives by government and charities have been based on EPPSE evidence **\(R4\)**. Action for Children, a charity aimed at helping vulnerable children, published a 2016 report highlighting the importance of the early home environment to improving life chances **\(E6\)**. As part of their *Fair by Five* campaign, this report called on government to make child development a national priority by 2020 and used EPPSE research to spearhead this campaign. The campaign was successful, in that the DfE allocated GBP13,500,000 to support HLE in 2018, and the research findings have directly influenced the DfE’s focus on home learning **\(E7\)**. The Secretary of State for Education, quoted in Parliament’s in\-house magazine, said that high\-quality early years education was ‘ *a core priority for his department*’, with specific emphasis on the Home Learning Environment **\(E8\)**. Consequently, the DfE funded The National Children’s Bureau, The National Literacy Trust, Peebles, and the Foundation Years Trust to deliver a range of projects to support the HLE, particularly in disadvantaged areas of the UK. This consortium published guidance for schools, nurseries, local authorities and public health partners, **\(E9\)** which cited EPPSE and SEED research and shared examples of best practice taken from areas of relative disadvantage in Bradford, Leicester, Hastings and Rother, the Wirral Peninsula, Oxfordshire, Bognor Regis and Knowsley. 

 In 2018, the DfE and the National Literacy Trust extensively cited EPPSE research when announcing the government’s behaviour change model to improve the HLE. This new policy consisted of a range of programmes to enhance the life chances of children from disadvantaged backgrounds including a national three\-year *Hungry Little Minds* campaign, based on the same research findings, which provides online tools for parents to enhance literary and language learning at home **\(E5\)**. 

 The Social Mobility Commission similarly utilised EPPSE findings on the impact of the HLE on children’s outcomes when recommending that government and local authorities *‘*\[drive\] *uptake of the early education offer for disadvantaged two\-year\-olds,’* to *‘*\[ensure\] *that all parenting support programmes are evidence based and* \[to experiment\] *with ways to offer effective advice to more parents’* **\(E10\).** EPPSE evidence directly led to the recommendation in a House of Commons Education Committee report, ‘Tackling disadvantage in the early years’ that the government *‘commission research on interventions that will support parents in providing a strong home learning environment for their children.’* The Education Committee report has been influential on the government’s wider early years social mobility programme, with the government’s response to the committee report referring to over GBP100,000,000 of investment in this area and also citing SEED findings on the importance of the HLE, stating *‘The evidence is clear…HLE is the single biggest influence on a child’s vocabulary at age three’* **\(E11, p.6\)**. 

###  Effects of quality on children’s development 

 EPPSE research **\(R3\)** has since extended to have an impact in policy development across Europe. In 2014, the European Commission published their ‘Proposal for Key Principles of a Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care’ that cites EPPSE publications multiple times. This document informed European\-wide strategy as part of Horizon 2020 about the importance of ECE in addressing child poverty and preventing early school leaving, which were two of the *‘headline targets of the EU2020 Strategy’* **\(E12\)**. 

###  Evidence\-based CPD 

 EPPSE and SEED research findings have been disseminated around the world, and according to a Professor of Early Childhood and Family Policy at Columbia University, ‘ *EPPSE’s findings have transformed the global discussion on quality in young children’s learning experiences’* **\(E13d\)** *.* In particular, the use and development of two quality rating scales provides strong findings of the impact of evidence\-based high\-quality practice on child development **\(R1, R2, R3, R5\)**. The ECERS\-E **\(R1\)** and SSTEW **\(R2, R6\)** scales are now being used extensively across the UK in research studies and pre/schools to improve practice, and the testimonials from Australia, Norway and Japan are just a few examples of their impact on hundreds of pre\-schools and tens of thousands of children and staff internationally **\[E13\]**. 

 Early education providers in many countries have adopted practices found effective in EPPSE/SEED. In Australia the largest provider of pre\-school education, Goodstart Early Learning, has purchased 850 copies of EPPSE/SEED’s quality rating scales to support quality practitioner practice as part of a *‘program of practice uplift’* for over 16,700 educators and 75,600 children across 660 centres **\(E13a\)**, and EPPSE’s findings *‘have led to the development of free high\-quality preschool for… all three\-year\-olds in Victoria, Australia.’* **\(E13d\)**. In Norway, EPPSE *‘has inspired both research and practice’* including multiple research projects at the University of Stavanger and the municipality of Stavanger’s introduction of SSTEW training to 123 kindergartens, improving ECE quality for over 7,000 children **\(E13b\)**. The University of Tokyo has translated EPPSE research, including the SSTEW scale, for publication in Japanese and *‘the essence and ideas’* of their CPD provision for over 6,000 ECE practitioners across Japan was *‘derived from SSTEW’* **\(E13c\)**. The University of Hong Kong has also made extensive use of the research and rating scales provided by EPPSE in shaping their ECE research and *‘data\-informed policy’* recommendations across the Asia\-Pacific region, including the Singapore Kindergarden Impact Project and the Free Quality Kindergarden Education Policy in Hong Kong **\(E13e\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2015, Ulinka Rublack published *The Astronomer and the Witch: Johannes Kepler´s Fight for His Mother* with Oxford University Press \[ **R1**\] *.* Based on archival and printed sources, the book tells the story of how the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler \(1571\-1630\) and his family responded to the accusation that their mother Katharina was a witch. In the Anglo\-American fiction and non\-fiction literature on this trial, Katharina has consistently been portrayed as a witch\-like woman. Rublack´s book overturns this account. ​Through documentaries, media appearances, press coverage, and the book's readership, Rublack has changed the way the public in the UK and Germany perceive Kepler and Katharina and provided fresh insight into the personal and familial effects of the witch trials. Her re\-appraisal of Katharina´s life has also inspired an opera, ​performed in Cambridge and Tübingen, as well as a film, in which Helen Mirren will act as Katharina.

 73,000 men and women were tried for witchcraft and 40,000 executed in Europe between 1500 and 1700. More than half of all victims were executed in the German lands from 1560. 75% of those accused were women. 

 One of these women was Katharina Kepler, the sixty\-eight\-year\-old, illiterate mother of the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler, who was accused in the South\-West German town of Leonberg in 1615. Katharina vehemently denied the charge and her family were equally outraged. The astronomer took over her legal defence. Yet it took six years for the old woman to be acquitted, by which time she was so frail that she died within months. 

 Professor Rublack of the Cambridge University History Faculty came across this trial in the Württemberg state archives thirty years ago. She began to research her book in 2010. Unusually so, the files of the trial were completely preserved. In addition, Rublack discovered that Johannes Kepler frequently had written in surprisingly observing and intimate terms about his life and the accusation. Moreover, the local community in which Katharina Kepler lived turned out to be one of the best documented for this period. 

 As Rublack read all these records, she understood how they could take us into the life of a community, woman and her family to understand just what could make an old woman vulnerable at a particular point in time and how much it took to protect her. The Keplers suddenly found themselves part of a drama to save their mother from a trial, torture, and the possibility of being burnt at the stake. 

 Rublack reconstructed Katharina´s life and the belief systems of the time. Johannes Kepler was at the height of his career during these years. From the very beginning, his tone was highly emotive as he set out to defend his own reputation at all costs. He became closer to his mother as he took over her defence. When his mother was finally acquitted, he was utterly exhausted. To revive his spirits, Kepler published a pioneering treatise that critiqued the notion that scientific and magic knowledge could be safely distinguished. 

 The Keplers´ trial tells us that the victims of Germany´s witch craze were not just women. Every member of the Kepler family, including two further siblings, reacted in different ways to their mother and the strain of a charge against her. 73,000 trials hint at such experiences shared by hundreds of thousands. 

 Rublack´s book hence recasts the way we approach the social impact of the witchcraze and how we think about the attitude of a leading natural philosopher towards knowledge. No previous publication had used the trial to discuss Kepler´s understanding of natural philosophy. The book was published by Oxford University Press \(Trade\) and translated into Chinese, Arabic, Italian, Hungarian and German, where it became a listed bestselling book within months, now in its fifth edition, having sold 10,000 copies.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Rublack´s book is threefold. 

 <ins>Promoting Public Understanding of the Kepler Trial</ins> 

 It, first, led to talks aimed at a wider public at literary and history festivals, book presentations, in schools and at summer\-schools, which reached around 3,000 listeners in the UK and Germany. In the UK, Rublack presented the book at the 2016 Hay Festival, the 2018 Wimpole History Festival and the Dartington Music Summer School. It also led to radio presentations, appearances on In Our Time \(Radio 4\), blogs and prominent book reviews in three languages. \[ **E1**\] One of these was in the Guardian, another in the German newspaper Die Zeit. It was shortlisted by the British Society for the History of Science for the Dingle Book Prize and nominated for Observer Book of the Year. This impact started in 2015 and continues, as the German edition was only published in October 2018. In July 2019, Rublack was awarded the German *Historiker*\-prize for her lifetime achievements and especially for *The Astronomer and the Witch* – a prize that is only awarded every three years and is the country´s most prestigious award for historians. \[ **E2**\] 

 <ins>Inspiring an Opera</ins> 

 The book, secondly, led to the creation of an entirely new opera, *Kepler´s Trial*, which was publicly performed at the Cambridge Festival of Ideas, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and, most recently, in parts and with new additions at Tübingen University, Germany. In sum, 750 people from the wider public as well as pupils who attended with their class listened to the opera live, while a YouTube film with a complete live\-recording counts 2,800 views to date. \[ **E3**\] 

 The opera resulted from two terms of structured thematic discussions with a team of interdisciplinary scholars and composer Tim Watts in Cambridge, October 2015 to April 2016, as well as film artist Aura Satz. Watts based the libretto and entire composition on the book and close discussions with Rublack and her colleagues in order to depart from previous portrayals of Kepler as distant from his mother´s world in operas by Hindemith and Glass. In Hindemith, Katharina features as deranged woman, whereas *Kepler´s Trial* engages with her humanity and plight. *Kepler´s Trial* moreover shows how much the relationship with his mother mattered for Kepler´s own understanding of knowledge and its use. It closely engages with Kepler´s time, both musically and through the involvement of visual art that was projected onto an elliptical screen. \[ **E4**\] 

 Rublack closely worked together with Aura Satz and the Fitzwilliam Museum Collections. They chose the sculpture of an old, naked woman from c.1530 that Rublack had used in her book to become a central feature in the film to communicate the harrowing experience of an aged mother accused of witchcraft. Satz had previously worked on Joan of Arc and is particularly interested in bringing out the voices of resisting women in past societies. She then further collaborated with Rublack to produce a further short film around this theme that was screened at film festivals. \[ **E5**\] 

 The opera and film performances were accompanied by extensive, free programme brochures and supported by a website which features numerous resources aimed at the broader public and teachers. The website includes, for example, the first English\-language translation of Kepler´s legal defence of his mother. \[ **E6**\] 

 The performance at the Victoria and Albert Museum was accompanied by a discussion with Dame Marina Warner and its innovative nature not least attracted interest by music specialists. Acclaimed pianist Dame Joanna McGregor therefore invited Rublack to lecture at the Dartington summer\-school 2018. Watts has since then performed scenes from the opera in Tübingen, to an audience of 300, and then in Munich in November 2019, for an audience of 500. \[ **E7**\] 

 All of these activities changed people´s sense of Kepler. He becomes visible as a man who lived in relation to women and their knowledge, and to a world in which modern boundaries between religion and magic were far from clear\-cut. 

 <ins>Developing a Major “Hollywood” Movie</ins> 

 Thirdly, in January 2018 the book attracted the interest of acclaimed film director Michael Hoffman and his production company Sympathetic Ink. Hoffman writes: 

 Ulinka Rublack, early in her book *The Astronomer and the Witch*, makes clear her intention to write an intimate history. While it deals with Johannes Kepler and supplies a wealth of detail about his life and thought, by choosing to center her narrative on his complex relationship with his mother, a woman accused of witch craft at the height of the German witch craze, Rublack brings home the challenge and pain of lives pulled apart by the tension between a dying medieval world and the birth of the enlightenment. It was this very human dimension of the conception and the writing of *The Astronomer and the Witch* that made me see in it the potential for a film. Kepler emerges as brilliant scientist, yes, but as a father too, and a son. Her razor\-sharp description of the town of Leonberg and the profiles of its inhabitants built painstakingly from civil documents and trial records created a world so specific and at the same time so universal, that the translation from the book to the screenplay was a deeply rewarding opportunity. The fact that Academy Award winner, Helen Mirren, saw immediately the potential in the role of Katharina Kepler is again a testament to the depth and power of Dr. Rublack’s research. Michael Hoffman \[ **E8**\] 

 After contacting Rublack in February 2018, Hoffman worked together with Roland Walters to write a film script closely based on the book and intense discussions with Rublack. Their collaboration is ongoing. Rublack has so far read and commented on twelve versions of the script, provided copious advice on secondary sources and questions of detail. She also organised a discussion of Hoffman and Walters with the interdisciplinary team of scholars involved in the making of the opera. In relation to the script, Rublack in particular ensured that the historical myth that Katharina´s aunt was burnt as a witch was not reproduced. There were intense discussions about the extent to which Katharina was involved in healing, and her possible relationship to magic. Focused discussions about how to convey Kepler´s personality and ideas are ongoing. Rublack took Hoffman and Walters to see locations related to Kepler´s life in Germany, and showed them archival records relating to Katharina. Not only then has her book fascinated these writers and directors, but the script also evolves in constant dialogue with her historical research and analysis. 

 Meanwhile, the casting has begun. Helen Mirren has confirmed that she will act as Katharina. A world\-leading actor has expressed his enthusiasm for the script and strong interest in the role of Kepler. Finalising the cast and the production of the film have been delayed due to COVID, as this will be a major international coproduction for the cinema and it continues to be difficult to confirm schedules. The production company is Sympathetic Ink, directed by Andy Paterson. Paterson confirmed in January 2020 that extensive location shooting had been completed. 

 Rublack´s research thus has clearly impacted on the UK´s arts and culture and will change widely held ideas about the witchcraze as targeting “old crones” active as healing women as well as about a scientific revolution championed by men who wholeheartedly repudiated “magic”. 

 Rublack has moreover been interviewed as sole historian in a documentary by SWR/ Film Gruppe 5 on Kepler that was shown across channels ranging from ARTE to Czech television in spring 2020 and is available on YouTube. Her interview led to the inclusion of Katharina´s story in the film, which was not previously envisaged. \[ **E9**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel Creative Writing research has transformed and diversified the UK literary landscape since 2014. The national engagement of ‘The Complete Works Poetry’ has increased the representation of ethnic\-minority authors in the publishing industry by 10% \(up from below 1% in 2005\), and Professor Benjamin Zephaniah’s work has influenced approximately 105,000 pupils at 105 UK schools to read and write. The international success of the Brunel African Poetry Prize has enabled winners to collaborate with Beyonce and be translated into 5 different languages spoken across the globe, expanding international readership of minority authors significantly. Professor Bernardine Evaristo was the first black woman to be named Author of the Year in 2020, following the success of her Booker\-awarded novel, *Girl, Woman, Other*, which subsequently led to the biggest shake\-up in the UK publishing industry to\-date. Brunel’s Creative Writing researchers have redefined the contemporary UK literary field as a diverse, internationally recognised cultural brand and, in the process, have raised public awareness of marginalised literary voices and demonstrated that reading and writing is for everybody. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prof. Evaristo’s research into the life and work of Amiri Baraka \(Ref. 2\), one of the most famous and controversial African American artists of the 20th century, was to assess what underpinned his politics and to what extent his influence reached beyond the United States in influencing the Black Arts movement in the UK. Research was carried out in London, UK and in New York and New Jersey, USA, through multiple interviews with people who knew him. These included 2 of America’s leading older African American women poets, Sonia Sanchez and Nikki Giovanni, who were part of his arts community in the 60s; as well as academics who wrote about him, such as Professor Gaffio Watts and Professor Komozie Woodard; and the director of the theatre where his work was most recently produced. Interviews were conducted with those who were involved in black arts in Britain, including theatre director, Hazel Carey, television director Charlie Hanson, who produced many trailblazing black programmes for the BBC, and Paulette Randall, Britain’s leading black female theatre director and a founder member of Theatre of Black Women. 

 The interviews revealed a complex, uncompromising and sometimes contradictory individual who wrote poetry for the masses, believed in black nationalism and spoke out against racial injustice. Yet while he ostensibly argued for equality, his radical stance was commensurately misogynistic, homophobic, anti\-Semitic, and intolerant of fellow black people who disagreed with him. The documentary also revealed that although publicly homophobic, Baraka had gay relationships when he was younger, and his attitudes towards women, at least, improved with the times. Yet he was bigoted while decrying bigotry. The interviews and conversations also revealed the power of his writing and the Black Arts Movement to inspire young black people developing careers in the arts in the UK in the 80s. The documentary was ground\-breaking as an investigation into the radical black arts scenes of 2 countries and 2 eras, and it was the first, and is, the only radio programme to focus on Baraka, and doubly so to view him through the multiple perspectives of those who knew him and those who were influenced by him. The final insights are in\-depth yet also expansive in making transatlantic connections for black people who are making art happen in societies where they are marginalised and need to create platforms to be heard, to be included, to reflect their specific, demographic realities. 

 As one of the world’s most celebrated performance poets as well as a novelist, playwright, reggae musician and self\-style ‘troublemaker’, Prof. Zephaniah’s research as practice grew out of the poetry school known as the ‘dub poets’. His poetry combines campaigning politics with humour and is enjoyed by a broad demographic both racially, socially and in terms of age. Prof. Zephaniah’s autobiography *The Life and Rhymes of Benjamin Zephaniah* \(Ref. 5\) highlighted his personal struggles as a black artist making his way in the publishing and wider creative industries in the racially discriminatory times of the 1970s and 1980s. 

 Dr Lowe’s work combines historical research with memory studies and postcolonial studies. Her research as practice currently explores British multicultural society and its links to the Caribbean and China. Her most recent publication, *Women Writers and the Windrush Legacy* \(Ref. 4\), reclaims the story of Windrush for women writers who addressed the subject, and female Caribbean writers of the time generally, who faced a confrontation with British institutions including a sometimes\-hostile publishing industry. 

 With *Girl, Woman, Other* \(Ref. 1\), Prof. Evaristo’s aim was to see if she could address the almost complete absence of black British women in British fiction in a single novel. There are some 800,000 black British women and Prof. Evaristo wanted to explore a little of the variety of who they are. Extensive research followed, through reading literature, fields trips, internet research, personal conversations, historical research and fictional experimentation. The novel presents the findings of the research through the creation of 12 distinct protagonists in *Girl, Woman, Other* making it a polyphonic fiction. Prof. Evaristo discovered that multiplicity is a weapon against stereotyping and invisibility. The novel spans different cultural backgrounds, ages, classes, sexualities and occupations, and it provided insights into the construction of multiple character formations, including 1 non\-binary womxn. Regarding form, Prof. Evaristo invented a new form for the novel. This employs a kind of poetic patterning and compression, which allows her to simultaneously get inside each character’s thoughts as if they are speaking in the first person, but to also present them externally, while segueing their past with their present. The unorthodox punctuation is also an experimental and liberating free\-flowing fusion of language.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 A survey conducted by the Publishers Association in 2019 found that the UK publishing workforce has failed to reflect Britain’s racial and regional diversity. Only 11.6% of respondents identified as BAME, which is 2.4% lower than the UK population \(14%\) and 28.6% lower than London \(40.2%\), where most major publishers are based. These results echo those of a survey conducted in 2017, which found that 90% of the publishing workforce was white. This is in direct correlation to the underrepresentation of Black authors in publishing, who often do not make it through the submission process in the first place due to a lack of relatability on the publishers’ side. This results “in fewer representations of marginalised communities and fewer visible authors from \[poorer\] regions, meaning kids \[who grow up poor and working class\] will still grow up thinking writing is something other people do” \(E1\). 

 Brunel research has gone actively against the ‘whiteness’ of the publishing industry, and has rallied for the commissioning of more black editors and convinced publishing houses to start implementing change. Over the course of the last 7 years, Brunel research has enabled over 40 minority authors to be published in prestigious outlets and win internationally renowned literary prizes. Likewise, it has significantly expanded readership and introduced approximately 105,000 pupils from all backgrounds to the world of reading and writing, encouraging them that it is something anyone can do regardless of where they come from. 

 **I. Diversifying the UK publishing industry.** 

 The research has had significant impact on the UK publishing industry and opened the doors to the biggest shake\-up in publishing houses to\-date. In June 2020, Prof. Evaristo’s Booker\-awarded novel *Girl, Woman, Other* \(which sold over 500,000 copies\) topped the paperback chart, making her the first woman of colour to claim that spot \(E2\). Prof. Evaristo was also named Author of the Year at the British Book Awards, making her the first black writer to win. UK publishing had previously been criticised for being a “hostile environment for black authors” and been urged to “look inside with \[their\] actions to improve the environment for black authors” \(E3\). 

 In the same month, the ‘big 5’ UK publishing houses \(Penguin Random House; Macmillan; Hachette; HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster\) acknowledged that “they must do a lot more to address racial inequalities in the books world” \(E4\). This response was a direct result of the historically unprecedented paperback charts in June 2020 and an open letter written by the newly formed Black Writers Guild \(BWG\), where Prof. Evaristo and Prof. Zephaniah are 2 out of over 100 members. The letter called on all major UK publishing houses to introduce much needed reforms to make the industry more inclusive. In October 2020, Prof. Evaristo has been awarded an OBE which further contributed to diverse literature being put on the list of national treasures. 

 In order to facilitate the much\-needed change within the publishing industry, Brunel research had already begun addressing the issue 8 years prior. In 2012, Prof. Evaristo founded the Brunel International African Poetry Prize, an annual poetry prize worth GBP3,000 that develops, celebrates, and promotes poetry from Africa. The prize—which is the largest African poetry prize in the world—was set up to revitalise African poetry, increase its visibility in the literary scene and actively support poets in the opening of doors leading towards an international presence. Since 2014, there have been 43 shortlisted poets and 11 winners. During the assessment period, winners have gone on to collaborate with Beyonce who used their poetry in her 2016 album *Lemonade*, which was the highest\-selling album globally that year with 2,500,000 copies sold \(Warsan Shire\); been awarded Guardian Best Book of 2017 \(Nick Makoha\); appeared in the New York Times \(Nick Makoha, Gbenga Adesina\); gained employment as Poetry Fellow at New York University \(Gbenga Adesina, 2017\) and won the Young Poet Laureate for London \(Warsan Shire, October 2013\) and Young People’s Laureate for London \(Momtaza Mehri, 2018\). They have also been published as Penguin Modern Poet \(Warsan Shire, 2017\) and been translated into over 5 different languages \(Safia Elhillo\), including Arabic thereby expanding their readership significantly. Between them, they have published over 15 chapbooks \(E5\). 

 A related scheme, The Complete Works Poetry, was founded by Prof. Evaristo in 2007 and ran until 2017. It was deemed the most successful poetry\-mentoring scheme in the UK. Funded by the Arts Council England \(GBP260,000\) it was designed to shake up the poetry\-publishing industry and increase the number of black and Asian authors. From 2014 to 2017, 10 poets were individually mentored for 1 to 2 years by many of Britain’s leading poets. The scheme was successful: while in 2005, less than 1% of black and Asian poets were published, in 2016 that number had risen to 10%. 

 Since 2014, former mentees have been shortlisted for the Seamus Heaney Centre Poetry Prize worth GBP5,000 \(Malika Booker, 2014\); won the Manchester Poetry Prize \(Mona Arshi, 2014\) and the Forward Prize \(Mona Arshi, 2015\), both worth GBP10,000; won the T.S. Eliot Prize worth GBP25,000 \(Sarah Howe, 2015\) and joined famous previous winners such as Seamus Heaney and Sean O’Brien in the ranks; gained appointments at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and Royal Holloway University \(Kayo Chingonyi, 2015\); and published poetry collections \(2014, 2015, 2016, 2017\) with Penguin and other prestigious outlets, such as the Financial Times \(Rishi Dastidar, Sarah Howe\) and British Council Literature \(Raymond Antrobus\) \(E6\). 

 **II. Increasing pupils’ attainment and transforming the literary landscapes of UK schools.** Prof. Zephaniah’s performance poetry with a political tone has encouraged pupils from all backgrounds to read and write more. His research goes directly against the notion that “writing is something other people do” \(E1\) and shows that you can be anything you want to be regardless of where you are from. Since 2014, it has been used by approximately 105 schools across the UK to inspire 105,000 pupils to read and write. 

 Prof. Zephaniah’s autobiography describes his non\-literary background and impoverished upbringing in Birmingham as a Windrush child and how he was ultimately able to turn his life around through literature. Pulling from his story, schools and local education authorities have used his poetry to create a role model for their pupils. In December 2018, Harrow College named a building after him. The new Zephaniah Learning Centre was funded through the Mayor’s Skills for Londoners Capital Fund \(GBP2,500,000\). At the launch event, the Deputy Mayor for Planning, Regeneration and Skills \(Greater London Authority\), said, “The Mayor and I are committed to ensuring all Londoners, whatever their background, can share in the capital’s prosperity and fulfil their potential – this brilliant new learning centre will help equip many more local people with the skills they need” \(E7\). 

 The Principal of Harrow College was “delighted to officially open the new Zephaniah Building which promises to provide learning opportunities to all students who use it” \(E7\). In 2019, pupils with learning difficulties and disabilities shared their own writing with Prof. Zephaniah when he visited campus, “showing how they had been inspired by his vibrant, evocative poems” \(E8\). Prof. Zephaniah has enabled pupils to create new forms of artistic expressions which, particularly in 2020, have had therapeutic purposes when it enhanced the quality of their lives during the lockdown brought about by Covid\-19. 

 Prof. Zephaniah’s work has increased the representation of black literature in schools and demonstrated to pupils that anyone can be a reader and writer. Schools across the country have used his poetry to reduce the misrepresentation of black literature and simultaneously develop a literary framework to which ethnic\-minority students can relate. Prof. Zephaniah was the first black British author with which many pupils could identify. This subsequently reduced the discriminatory notion of “you are not a poet in the eyes of the white man” and instead enabled them to learn that poetry is for them. 

 Prof. Zephaniah’s poetry has also introduced pupils at predominantly white schools to ethnic\-minority communities and broadened their understanding of our world where history is often ignored. These schools have benefitted from his work in the telling and visualisation of black history and increase their pupils’ understanding of what is happening in the world \(E9\). 

 **III. Raising public awareness of marginalized voices.** 

 The works by Prof. Zephaniah and Dr Lowe \(then, Lecturer\) have also been used to raise awareness of the Windrush generation and bring into the public domain voices which are usually silenced. On Windrush Day 2020, the British Library \(BL\) released audio recordings of 3 public events held in 2018, where they had used Dr Lowe’s work in an exhibition \( *Windrush: Songs in a Strange Land*\) to “shed new light on the significance of the arrival of the *Windrush* as part of a longer history of slavery and colonialism” \(E10\). The BL had commissioned Dr Lowe to create a poem\-film for the exhibition in order to educate the public about improving the “relationship between Britain, the Caribbean and the descendants of the ‘Windrush Generation’ \[which\] continues to be fraught as anti\-racist protests gather force…” \(E10\). 

 Prof. Zephaniah’s *Windrush Child* directly relates to this undertaking, as it makes the present\-day subjects of Windrush, racism, and terrorism accessible to young people. Both Dr Lowe’s and Prof. Zephaniah’s poetry contribute to widening the public access to unsung stories of the past and increase their understanding of “what’s happening in the world, and change it for the better \[which\] we owe to ourselves, and future generations” \(E9\). 

 Brunel Creative Writing is a leading example of how excellent research can transform the literary landscape of a nation, by opening the doors of the publishing industry to ethnic\-minority authors; addressing racial inequalities in the world of literature; and creating a new literary framework for an entire generation of pupils that shows that reading and writing is indeed for everybody.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Underpinning Research: We have developed an end\-to\-end package of theory, tools, technologies and implementation strategies that has enabled breeding companies locally and globally to deploy genomic selection in their routine breeding programmes. 

 Significance and Reach of Impact: Adoption of our genomic selection toolkit has led to the following benefits in these exemplar sectors: 

-  For **Genus PLC**, which provides 25% of the world’s pig genetically improved breeding stock, genomic selection has since October 2013 doubled the accuracy of selection for female reproductive performance traits, resulting in an average annual increase in genetic potential for the number of piglets produced per sow per year from 0.65 in 2013 to 1.4 in 2020. Overall, genomic selection has enabled Genus customers to produce 2,000,000t more pig meat per year, resulting in GBP300,000,000 potential extra profit to producers. 

-  For **Yorkshire Dairy Goats**, which supplies 40% of the UK’s goat milk and products, genomic selection \(since 2014\) has increased use of elite male goats, doubling the rate of genetic improvement and leading to 73% higher yields of milk, reduced costs of production and improved fertility and welfare. 

-  For **Aviagen Ltd**, the market leader for the world’s chicken and turkey genetics with more than 50% market share in both species, genomic selection \(since 2016\) has resulted in increases in the accuracy of selection of approximately 20% for fertility traits and more than 50% for feed intake. Such improvements are associated with significant economic and environmental benefits, including an estimated saving of 673,651t of feed per year across that sector of the global market supplied by Aviagen.

##  2. Underpinning research 

###  The Challenge: How to sustainably increase food production 

 The Food and Agriculture Organisation \(FAO\) estimate that to meet the challenge of producing enough food to feed the world’s population sustainably for the next 50 years, the rates of livestock productivity need to double. Historically, selective breeding has accounted for 50% of the improvement in livestock productivity. In practice, therefore, this need for rapid improvement translates to a need for a step change in the current rates of genetic gain, i.e. the improvement in performance per generation achieved through breeding, in livestock breeding programmes. 

 From 2002 onwards, we have made substantial contributions to this goal by introducing the concept of genomic selection and demonstrating how it can be harnessed by the farming industry \(reported in  [REF2014/6/1f](https://impact.ref.ac.uk/casestudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=23921)\). Since REF2014, we have facilitated and driven the practical uptake of genomic selection in commercial breeding programmes for multiple species through developing an end\-to\-end package of underpinning theory, tools, technologies and implementation strategies. 

####  An end\-to\-end package of tools to enable genomic selection in multiple species and traits 

#####  Breaking the cost barrier 

 Genomic selection requires a large volume of high\-density genomic data, which is expensive to analyse, and in the past represented a barrier to commercial implementation of genomic selection. Since REF 2014, we have overcome this barrier by recognising that it was possible to track desired genome segments passed from key males to their descendants using only a small number of markers; a process called imputation \[3.1\]. To enable imputation to be implemented in practice, we have contributed to high\-quality reference genomes for key farmed animals via a leading role in the international Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes consortium and development of a software package containing the imputation algorithm \[3.1\]. 

#####  Enabling and optimising genomic prediction 

 A key driver of the success of genomic selection is the accuracy of genomic prediction. This is based on establishing a set of genotyped and phenotyped individuals known as the “training set”, and using this to produce an equation that allows the value of the animals in the breeding programme for the trait\(s\) of interest to be predicted accurately from their marker genotypes. We were the first to set out the theoretical basis of training set design \[3.2\] and provide practical rules of thumb for the design process. 

 Through using these training sets, as well as genotyping and imputation strategies, breeding and recording organisations routinely generate extensive datasets. To maximise the accuracy of genomic selection based on these datasets, we have now developed a suite of scalable statistical methods \[e.g. 3.3\] and made them available to the academic community and industry. 

 Working collaboratively with Aviagen and Genus in landmark projects funded via the Innovate UK Agri\-Tech Catalyst scheme, we have generated whole\-genome sequence datasets for many thousands of elite chickens and pigs to further refine the accuracy of selection decisions. 

#####  Breeding programme designs to optimally exploit genomic technology 

 In addition to devising imputation strategies \[3.1\], we have made other pivotal contributions to breeding programme designs, including theory for the management of inbreeding under genomic selection \[reported in REF2014\] and methods for estimating linkage disequilibrium in mixed breed populations \[3.4\]. To facilitate uptake of these and other methodological developments we have since REF 2014 developed tools that simulate a wide range of mating designs, biotechnologies and selection strategies allowing both academic and commercial users to perform breeding simulations in any species using a wide range of strategies \[3.5\]. The newest open source version of this, AlphaSimR, has been downloaded 19,672 times since 2018. 

#####  Empirical analysis of prototype/emerging datasets 

 To achieve gains from this end\-to\-end package for genomic selection, we have worked with industry to apply it to routine commercial breeding programmes. For example, in collaboration with Yorkshire Dairy Goats, we were the first team to collate milk yield, pedigree and genotype data from UK commercial dairy goats. We then analysed these data to show, using methods described earlier \[3.4\], that crossbred populations were amenable to genomic selection. We demonstrated the additional accuracy that genomic data can provide compared to the conventional pedigree\-based approach to breeding, producing genomic evaluations for the first time for commercial crossbred dairy goats for milk production \[3.6\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The body of research described above has enabled major breeding organisations and individual farm businesses to deploy genomic selection in their breeding programmes. This has driven measurable improvements in productivity and efficiency of the global farming industry. We illustrate this using 3 example species: pigs, dairy goats and poultry. 

####  Impact on pig breeding: Genus 

 The end\-to\-end package of tools developed through our research has had a “ *transformative effect*” on the breeding programme at the world’s largest pig genetics company, Genus. With 25% share of the global market, Genus is the international leader in providing genetically superior breeding stock and technical support services in animal nutrition, health and management to pig producers across the world. 

 Genus confirm that they adopted genomic selection on a routine basis in October 2013, using the tools developed by our researchers amongst others \[5.1\]. Routine deployment of genomic selection has resulted in a doubling of accuracy of selection for female reproductive performance traits, such as the number of piglets born and time taken to return to reproduction following weaning, which were previously difficult and expensive to measure and thus to improve. As a result of this doubled accuracy of selection, the average annual increase in genetic potential for number of piglets produced per sow per year has more than doubled from 0.65 in 2013 to 1.4 in 2020 \[5.1\]. 

 Overall, owing to the improvements in female reproductive performance and pig growth, robustness and efficiency, the annual rate of genetic gain for pig productivity and increased profit potential for customers of Genus has increased by 40% between 2013 and 2020 \[5.1\]. Genus estimate that “ *At the global production level, this may translate to an annual increase of 2,000,000 tonnes of pig meat, which in turn may equate in up to GBP300,000,000 in extra profit potential per year for Genus customers worldwide \(GBP3,500,000 for UK producers\).*” *The genetic gain is cumulative, and as such will drive recurrent benefits to the farming sector as well as the pork\-consuming market, through increased availability of high quality, nutritious and affordable protein. The continued advancement in genetic selection and impact from these advanced tools have also allowed improved rate of gain in traits such as feed efficiency, that drive positive contribution to improving the sustainability of global pork production, and animal welfare and well\-being, via targeted improvements in leg structure and piglet mortality*.” \[5.1\]. 

####  Impact on goat breeding: Yorkshire Dairy Goats \(YDG\) 

 Our collaboration with YDG, supported by Innovate UK funding, resulted in YDG implementing genomic selection in their breeding programmes in 2014; the first dairy goat company in the world to do so. By the end of 2018, 16,500 animals had been genotyped \[5.2\]. 

 Genomic selection has enabled YDG to identify the male goats with the best milk\-producing daughters at an earlier age. This has: 1\) saved resources by allowing YDG to keep fewer of the males with less productive offspring, and 2\) allowed the best males to be bred from an earlier age, resulting in greater numbers of offspring from these males. These advances have driven increased rates of genetic improvement and led to 73% higher average yields of milk and thus improved profitability for YDG and its customers \[5.2; 5.3\]. In addition, genomic selection has allowed YDG to apply selection to other key traits, including mastitis resistance, feed efficiency and out\-of\-season breeding \[5.3\]. 

 Overall, YDG states that our collaboration with them: “ *has enabled selection to be applied to a wider range of traits ensuring that future generations of YDG goats can produce high volumes of milk but remain healthy and fertile. These benefits will take years to manifest in the herd but are of vital importance for future sales*.” \[5.2\]. 

 In addition, our collaboration has created opportunities for YDG to export high genetic merit animals, embryos, and frozen semen, based on the genomic predictions we developed. YDG have already purchased a farm in New Zealand and are exporting superior embryos in order to establish a satellite goat herd there. High\-value exports of improved embryos and breeding stock to China are already underway \[5.3\]. 

####  Impact on poultry breeding: Aviagen 

 Aviagen is the market leader for meat\-type poultry, supplying broiler and turkey breeding stock to over 100 countries around the world. Collaboration with our team helped Aviagen to become the world’s first poultry breeding company to implement genomic selection in its chicken and turkey breeding programmes; an innovation that was in place by 2016 \[5.4\]. 

 Aviagen’s use of genomics to inform selection decisions has resulted in a consistent improvement in many key traits in broilers, with a relative improvement in accuracy ranging from 20% for fertility to 45% for egg production, while for highly heritable traits, such as feed intake, this improvement can be greater than 50% \[5.5\]. Due to the structure and scale of the global poultry supply chain, such improvements have a profound impact in improving its efficiency and sustainability. Notably, improving the accuracy of predicting genetic merit for Feed Conversion Ratio \(FCR\), a measure of biological efficiency and a key driver of profitable and sustainable production, can significantly reduce the environmental footprint of the global poultry system. The 2019 global production of chicken meat was 118,017,161t, equivalent to 168,412,688t of body weight \[5.6\]. Our conservative estimate of the commercial field improvement in FCR is –0.020 kg/kg each year, \[5.7a\-c\]. For the 50% share of the global broiler industry supplied by Aviagen, this equates to a cumulative annual saving of 0.02 × 168,412,688 x 0.5 = 1,684,127t of feed. Based on the evidence that 40% of this gain is due to implementation of genomic selection as described here \[5.7\], a conservative estimate of the  saving in feed requirement is 673,650t – enough to feed at least 150,000,000 additional birds from the same quantity of feed grown. 

 This means that, despite the increase in demand requiring more birds to be reared globally, improvements in FCR driven by genomic selection enhance efficiency and reduce the economic cost and environmental footprint of the production of chicken meat \[5.4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In southern Peru, where the native Amerindian languages Quechua and Aymara are spoken in rural areas, Howard’s collaboration with female indigenous leaders of civil society associations benefited bilingual women’s lives in a range of ways. These women \(age range 30 to 60\) work as *ad hoc* interpreters between monolingual speakers of Quechua or Aymara and Spanish\-speaking officials in public service settings wherein linguistic and cultural misunderstandings and prejudice often lead to poor medical attention, miscarriages of justice and disregard for human rights. Howard’s project facilitated the women’s reflection on how their interpretive practices allay infringements of human rights; helped them visibilise their activity at state and society levels; enhanced their sense of worth as bilingual indigenous leaders doing an indispensable job on an unaccredited basis and going unrecognised by officialdom; and created significant opportunities for their professionalisation. These benefits first changed the lives of the 15 indigenous women directly involved in the project, whereupon their experience led to a snowballing effect from which other female members of the regional associations widely benefited. Howard’s project further extended its reach, catalysing collaboration between a partner NGO and the state, which triggered changes in public servants’ practice in the cultural sector and heightened public awareness of minority language rights. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Howard has a long record of research that is unique in the UK, focussing as it does on South American indigenous languages, language politics and language policies, and especially on Quechua in Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Her book on language ideologies in the Andes \( **PUB1**\), advisedly written in Spanish and published by a group of leading academic publishers in Peru, is widely read by academics, policy makers and students in Latin America, and led to her being invited in 2014 to act as informal consultant on language policy to Peru's Ministry of Culture. This generated a major AHRC\-funded research project, supported by the Ministry \(‘Legislated mediation of indigenous language rights in Peru’, Howard PI, 2014–2016: GRANT1\), and its successor, 'Improving women's lives through the role of female social interpreters in rural Peru' \(Howard Co\-I, 2018–2019: GRANT2\). These international collaborative projects investigated the relationship between translation and interpreting between Spanish and indigenous languages and human rights, and indigenous people’s empowerment in their capacity as translators and interpreters. Institutional collaborators included University of Stirling, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, Peru's Ministry of Culture, and the Peruvian NGO *SER* \(Rural Educational Services\). 

 Key findings were: 

 **\(i\)** That training translators and interpreters between Spanish and the indigenous languages is culturally complex; the trainees being motivated by a pre\-existing activism oriented towards indigenous rights and empowerment, in addition to seeking the technical skills required of professional translators and interpreters \( **PUB4**\). 

 **\(ii\)** That translating the Peruvian ‘Indigenous Languages Act’ \(Law N<sup>o</sup>. 29735\) from Spanish into the native languages, and interpreting in legal settings, raise difficulties due to the lack of lexical equivalents to express legal concepts, and owing to the different discourse conventions and cultural contexts of the target languages \( **PUBS 2, 3 and 5**\). 

 **\(iii\)** That bilingual female indigenous community leaders act as *ad hoc* interpreters in Quechua and Aymara regions of southern Peru, voluntarily and without the intervention of the state \( **PUB6**\). 

 The GRANT1 project focused on the state\-led indigenous language translation and interpreting programme run by the Ministry of Culture. In the course of this research, the NGO *SER* made the research team aware of bilingual indigenous women leaders’ work as *ad hoc* interpreters and human rights advocates within their regional civil society organisations. The Ministry team had not known about the grassroots *ad hoc* interpreter activity until Howard’s research team uncovered it; thanks to the project’s findings, coordination between the Ministry and *SER* ensued, which made a significant contribution to her policy\-related impact \(see section 4\(b\)\). It was on the strength of these findings that Howard and her co\-researchers were awarded GRANT2 ‘ [Female Indigenous Language Brokers in Peru’](https://peruproject.stir.ac.uk/), enabling her to build on finding \(iii\) by bringing to state and public notice the *ad hoc* interpreters’ work. 

 The significance of Howard’s GRANT2 project’s impact is established by the fact that it was realised in a region where people’s everyday experiences are still shaped by the effects of extreme trauma: the Ayacucho department was the epicentre of Peru’s internal war between Shining Path insurgents and the state \(1980–2000\), with indigenous people caught in its crossfire. Ayacucho was, furthermore, the focus of a ‘public health’ campaign in which indigenous people were forcibly sterilised \(1995–2001\). Howard’s research generated the three types of impact, described below in section 4, by applying an action research methodology and which involved pathways to impact such as workshops, role\-plays, focus groups, interviews and public events. These were undertaken in collaboration with her co\-investigators, the above\-mentioned NGO, the state ‘Memory Museum’, in addition to a political theatre company with an important national and international profile.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research produced a range of interrelated impacts, namely: it influenced the practice of public servants in the field of human rights; it provided new development opportunities for our NGO partners; it contributed to the public recognition, self\-esteem and ongoing capacity building of the project’s female indigenous *ad hoc* interpreter participants. In order to understand the reach and significance of these impacts, Howard and her co\-researchers conducted focus groups and interviews with the 15 *ad hoc* interpreters \(Lima, 11 November 2018; Ayacucho, 7 August 2019; Puno, 9 August 2019\) and with 4 members of the *LUM* team \(Lima, 4 April 2019\).  The quotes in this section are extracts from these interactions, translated from Spanish and Quechua. 

 **Impact is divided into 3 categories: a. Impact on Individuals; b. Impact on Policy; c. Impact on Public and Institutional Attitudes and Understanding. Proper names in this section are pseudonyms.** 

 **\(a\)**. **Impact on individuals. Raising public visibility, self\-esteem and opportunities for bilingual indigenous women leaders working as ad hoc interpreters for non\-Spanish speaking people in rural Peru.** 

 The 15 *ad hoc* interpreters emphasised that working with the project gave them a sense of empowerment and visibility with which to carry on their practice with renewed confidence: ‘We are no longer hidden like before; sometimes we feel weak within our organisations, but now we have the courage to stand up for ourselves and carry on’. They noted a snowballing effect among their peers: ‘This experience has made visible not just us but other women and men who do the same work as we do. We \[the participant group\] are just the “thin end of the wedge”, making the State realise that among Andean and Amazonian peoples there are individuals who provide this \( *ad hoc* interpreting\) service voluntarily’ \( **IMP4**\). 

 They also commented on how the project had made them aware of their linguistic rights: ‘Before, we were afraid to speak our \[Quechua\] language in public. \[...\] We were discriminated against because of it. Now, with the project, we have become aware of our rights, we talk Quechua in the bank, in the town hall, in the street. If people look at us, we carry on talking it’ \( **IMP4**\). 

 For some, the project led them to language certification organised by the Ministry of Education: ‘Never in my life did I think that our Quechua language was important. And then when you brought the project about “interpreting” \(...\) I said to myself “Ah ok, without being professionals, we were interpreters”. \(...\) It was a surprise to me that without being a professional or having official documents in that field, they gave me a certificate for the Quechua I spoke’ \( **IMP4**\). 

 Another participant attributes her professional growth to experience with the project: ‘It's because of that I believe that I was elected President of the Departmental Association of Peasant Women of Puno.’\* Aurora describes herself as providing a role model for other women, using the USB recording of the project’s stageplay provided in order to extend the reach of her message: ‘“Look at comrade Aurora\! Why can we not be like her?”’ she quotes them saying \( **IMP4**\). \*Clarification from President of SER: “Aurora was nominated President of the Organising Committee of the Association’s Annual Congress, November 2019; this is an influential Association at Department level and Aurora is an increasingly active member.” \(E\-mail to R. Howard, 8 September 2020\). 

 Involvement in the project led to two participants benefitting personally and professionally via their acceptance onto the Ministry of Culture training course for indigenous interpreters \( **IMP3; IMP10**\). As one of them expressed: ‘The project was an awakening for me, making me recognise my potential as a translator and interpreter, that this could bring me opportunities’. The training led to her qualifying both as interpreter and translator. Both participants now appear on the National Register of Indigenous Translators and Interpreters \( **IMP10**\). Since the project’s end, the women have continued to build on this experience and extend its reach to others: ‘There's the opportunity to continue spreading the skills \[we have acquired\] to other women in our communities, so that they can take part in training courses, and continue growing over the next ten, fifteen, twenty years’ \( **IMP4**\). 

 On a poignant note, one woman commented that the experience was cathartic for her: ‘When we gave our testimony \[on camera\] some of us shed tears as we remembered the difficulties we have had’. Yet she asked us not to edit the footage: ‘We need to show not only that we are strong but also that we have emotions when we remember the comrades who are no longer with us’ \( **IMP4**\). 

  

 **\(b\). Impact on Policy: The project influenced policymakers to include bilingual indigenous women leaders in formal judicial processes.** 

 The project led directly to some of the *ad hoc* interpreters on the project being recruited by Peru's Ministry of Justice Commission with the task of registering Quechua\- and Aymara\-speaking victims of the 1990s forced sterilisation programme \( *REVIESFO*\), thus helping ensure the rightful registration of victims. Howard and *SER* had co\-convened a public debate on language rights in Ayacucho with panel members from the Ministry of Culture, the Ombudsman’s Office and the *REVIESFO* Commission \(19 August 2016\). The majority of attendees revealed that this panel was instrumental in making them aware of the forced sterilisation programme for the first time, and that, as a result, they now recognised the importance of language rights \(29 audience questionnaires: **IMP1**\). The *REVIESFO* Commission member described the lack of female interpreters in the hearings; a fact of which the researchers, the public and *SER* had been unaware. Shortly afterwards, on behalf of the *REVIESFO* Commission, the Ministry of Justice asked the Ministry of Culture to provide them with female interpreters familiar with the cultural and linguistic context. The Ministry of Culture, having learned about the *ad hoc* interpreters through the project, contacted *SER*, who, now understanding the need, identified 4 suitable interpreters from the group and wrote them letters of recommendation which led to their being hired by the Commission. For the President of *SER*, this sequence of events evidences the significant impact of Howard’s project on governmental practices \( **IMP2, IMP3, IMP10**\). 

 Sara was one of those appointed to interpret on behalf of the Quechua speaking victims as they gave their testimonies: ‘On the back of this project, I worked as a Quechua interpreter for the *REVIESFO* commission \[...\] This was very important and very painful work... because \(the witnesses\) gave their testimonies of how they had been deceived into allowing themselves to have their fallopian tubes cut, and they told their stories in tears. \[...\] We were able to explain \[to the commissioners\] what the \[indigenous\] women were saying. \[...\] Our participation was very important because the women trusted us more than they trusted \[the interpreters\] they didn't know’ \( **IMP4**\). 

 Other participants commented that, in the context of a sharp rise in feminicide cases in 2019, interpreting should also be provided ‘for the judicial authorities in general’ \( **IMP4**\). 

 **\(c\). Impact on Public and Institutional Attitudes and Understanding: The project educated the public on the importance of indigenous language rights and influenced the practice of a human rights institution.** 

 The research process produced video and audio recordings, and photographs that became the basis for 3 public events in which the interpreters actively participated. These were: \(1\) An audio\-visual exhibition entitled ‘ [Companions: Indigenous translators for a more just society](https://lum.cultura.pe/exposiciones/yanapaqkuna-yanapirinaka-acompa%C3%B1antes) / *Lugar de la Memoria, la Tolerancia y la Inclusión Social*’, curated by Peru’s national Museum of Memory \[LUM\] \(December 2018–March 2019\); \(2\) A piece of testimonial theatre, ‘Women’s Voices’, based on their own words, created and performed with the high\-profile *Yuyachkani* theatre company in Lima \(10 November 2018\); \(3\) A screening of the filmed theatre performance in Ayacucho and Puno \(October 2019\). To ensure the impact’s sustainability, the audio\-visual material gathered has been housed in  [a uniquely designated SER collection](https://lum.cultura.pe/cdi/busqueda/documentos?field_rb_colecciones_tid%5B%5D=18601&field_rb_material_tid%5B%5D=1198) in *LUM*’s ‘Truth Commission’ digital repository. These comprise a video interview, testimony, and a photograph of each of the 14 *ad hoc* interpreters. 

 Audience responses to the ‘Women’s Voices’ play, which was performed live in Lima \(38 x exit questionnaires \( **IMP5**\)\) and watched on screen in Ayacucho and Puno \(16 x post\-it notes \( **IMP6**\)\), testify to the impact of the play’s message regarding linguistic human rights. The screening informed the regional public about linguistic human rights and visibilised the women leaders’ work in their home localities. 

 A focus group conducted by Howard and Co\-I Andrade with the *LUM* team, who had curated the ‘Companions’ exhibition, revealed that the Newcastle project contributed new dimensions to their work: ‘The exhibition has been very timely, especially as we are currently in the UN International Year of Indigenous Languages and there is heightened public interest in revaluing native languages. We also try to make the connection between the period of violence and the fact that 75% of the victims were Quechua and Asháninka speakers. The exhibition helped us highlight the connection between speaking an indigenous language and vulnerability \[...\]’  \( *LUM* Executive Director\). They also listened to the *ad hoc* interpreters’ comments as they were filmed viewing the museum’s permanent exhibition and found their own experiences of the internal war reflected in the interpreters’ comments: ‘it made a powerful impression on us’ \( *LUM* education officer\). Further, they drew lessons for changing their future practice: ‘We realised that the exhibition participants should also take part in the round table discussion...this experience has taught us to be inclusive in our approach’ and: ‘We have learned that curating, museography and education have to go together’ \( *LUM* team member\) \( **IMP7, IMP8**\). Public reactions to the temporary ‘Companions’ exhibition are embedded in the more general Visitor’s Book and these reveal how the public came to understand the role of women in the struggle for human rights, including their role as *ad hoc* interpreters, during the period of terrorism itself and that period’s enduring aftermaths \( **IMP9**\). 

 In summary then, this participatory action project provided the indigenous women participants with a life\-changing experience that had considerable significance for their personal and professional growth. For the majority, this was the first time they had visited their nation’s capital where their engagement with this high\-profile, internationally funded project provided them with a highly visible platform in Lima from which to collaborate with national cultural institutions. Through their theatrical performance, their exposure in the *LUM* exhibition space and their interactions with theatre professionals, they benefitted by acquiring new skills as well as gaining a life\-enhancing sense of self\-affirmation and an understanding of the broader significance of their—hitherto unrecognised—experience. The effect carries on, as testified by messages that reach Howard through their online networks, testifying that the positive impact of the Newcastle project on their lives continues. This project, therefore, enriched the lives of these women and created a ripple effect within their communities, enhancing their personal and professional standing within their local associations and with the NGO. Finally, the need for their experiences, linguistic identities and skills to be recognised, and the cultural\-political healing that their work engenders has been brought to the awareness of the state, regional authorities and the public, thus ensuring the enduring visibility and voice of this community.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Crawford’s research into policing partnerships informed the design, establishment and implementation of a large\-scale, innovative and sustainable police\-academic research partnership – the N8 Policing Research Partnership \(N8PRP\) – that has transformed organisational learning. This transformation has changed how police forces and partners in the North of England organise and use research evidence, generate and share knowledge and value research\-informed policing practice. The N8PRP operationalises and builds on Crawford's conceptualisation and methodologies of research co\-production and partnership\-working. Implementation of the Partnership has enhanced the application of research leading to changes in frontline policing. It has also influenced the development of evidence\-based policing and mechanisms underpinning effective police\-academic partnerships more broadly across the UK. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The use of research evidence in policing lags considerably behind other public services, such as healthcare, medicine and social care. Yet robust research knowledge can play a vital role in underpinning police legitimacy and the delivery of effective policing strategies and frontline practices. With radically different conceptions of what constitutes evidence, academic researchers and the police are influenced by contrasting demands and interests, and driven by distinct values and motivations, undermining the application of research evidence in policing. In 2012, the Home Office  [*Review of Police Leadership and Training*](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118222/report.pdf) identified the need for a fundamental ‘transformation of the culture of learning in the police service’ to translate research evidence into policing. Organisational learning from research across the 43 separate police forces in England and Wales has been piecemeal, fragmented and poorly coordinated. 

 Through his career\-spanning research, Crawford has identified barriers to constructive policing partnerships **\[1\-3\]** and developed a model of how the co\-production of research could be applied to policing and translate into policing practices **\[4,5\]**. It is explicitly based on the philosophy that those who use research and apply the knowledge base should be involved in building it by actively co\-producing the evidence **\[4\-6\]**. Crawford’s research findings and philosophy were translated, applied and adapted to policing through a series of research grants **\[a\-d\]** and resulted in designing, establishing and implementing the N8PRP in 2013. This provided a platform for collaboration between the eight research\-intensive universities that comprise the  [N8](https://www.n8research.org.uk/), 11 Police and Crime Commissioners \(PCCs\), 11 police forces and other community safety partners across the North of England. The N8PRP is the largest and most ambitious police\-academic research partnership in the UK and possibly across the globe. 

 Crawford’s methodologies of co\-production were piloted, tested and refined through an ESRC Knowledge Exchange Grant **\[a\]** with West Yorkshire Police and the Office of the PCC. Empirically, this project also provided a detailed analysis of policing partnerships working in the context of safeguarding children **\[3\]**. A College of Policing Grant **\[b\]** enabled Crawford to build research capacity among the N8 universities and engage policing partners across the North of England. A HEFCE Catalyst Grant **\[c\]** provided funding for an ambitious five\-year programme \(2015\-20\) of research and knowledge exchange to implement Crawford’s model of co\-production through the N8PRP’s police\-academic collaborative platforms and engagement mechanisms. In 2019, Crawford secured commitments from all N8PRP partners to a jointly funded, co\-governed model that will sustain the Partnership beyond the end of the Catalyst Grant through pooled investments **\[d\]**. This further embedded the co\-production philosophy, as informed by Crawford’s critical reflection on partnership implementation **\[4\-6\]**. 

 **Findings** 

 Crawford’s research identified barriers to effective policing partnerships **\[1\]** including: agencies’ conflicting interests, priorities, and cultural assumptions; poor conflict management processes; inappropriate governance and managerial structures; lack of trust between organisations; a desire to protect budgets; lack of capacity and expertise; technological and cultural barriers to sharing data; and over\-reliance on informal contacts which lapsed if key individuals moved on. Successful policing partnerships require meaningful, enduring, open and trusting relationships across agency boundaries **\[1\-3\]**. Crawford has piloted and developed co\-production as both a means and an end to effecting organisational change. The model involves police and academics co\-producing and sharing knowledge, with supporting structures and an ethos to support durable, mutually beneficial partnerships at multiple levels of the organisations **\[a\]** to ensure change is anchored within cultures **\[4,5\]**. 

 The N8PRP’s governance and process structures create a distinctive model for co\-production, cognisant of the barriers to policing partnerships **\[1\-3\]** and based on the following findings: 

-  A reformed conception of what constitutes knowledge – as socially\-distributed, transdisciplinary, action\-oriented and subject to multiple accountabilities – as well as how frontline practitioners can co\-create, mobilise and use knowledge **\[5,6\]**. 

-  A normative concern to translate and apply the knowledge base focused around public outcomes and benefits **\[4,5\]**. 

-  Benefits derive from frontline police staff and academics working together using different perspectives to jointly frame and shape questions, methodologies and impacts **\[4,5\]**. 

-  Change is rooted in, and occurs through, relationships and processes; it can be non\-linear and have many causes **\[5,6\]**. 

-  Impacts arise from processes of mutual learning, often involving a gradual series of changes undertaken collaboratively **\[6\]**.

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Crawford’s research and its implementation through the N8PRP have \(i\) transformed how police forces in the North of England organise and derive benefits from research and engage with academic researchers, and \(ii\) enriched the perception, value and use of research\-informed practice across policing organisations in the UK. Direct beneficiaries of the impacts include police and partners, with indirect benefits to service users and communities. 

 **\(i\) Transforming organisational learning and engagement with research/researchers** 

 The N8PRP’s infrastructure, operating principles and activities have positively transformed police\-academic relations, improved the quality of inter\-professional dialogue and enhanced the value of, and access to, research within policing. Key to this transformation in organisational learning have been the collaborative governance framework and new platforms for engagement, which have mitigated common barriers to policing partnerships identified by Crawford **\[1,2\]** and allowed the partners to reach collective decisions on priorities, investments and co\-designed research projects to be awarded funding. Partners are represented on the decision\-making N8PRP Steering Group, which includes College of Policing representation to ensure national learning and engagement. 

 A further operating principle of partnership governance has been the sharing of co\-produced research across the partners, the benefits of which was corroborated by the Strategy Manager at West Yorkshire Police: *‘As all police forces strive to be more evidence\-based, to be more innovative and to implement good practice/what works, the N8 structure allows those conversations to take place, with different perspectives between policing and academia shared. The infrastructure also allows for academia and police professionals to share research findings more widely with other forces so that there is a cumulative benefit’* **\[A\]**. This helped embed an evidence\-based approach to the police force’s strategic planning process **\[A\]**. 

 As a result of the Partnership, police have reorganised and adapted how they engage with the production and application of research. Informed by Crawford’s research on effective partnerships **\[1,3\]**, new platforms for engagement have included: annual policing innovation forums focused on collectively agreed priorities; data mobilisation events at which police identify under\-utilised datasets; and the  [Register of Experts](https://n8prp.org.uk/experts/), providing accessible means of connecting researchers and practitioners to build inter\-organisational research capability and enable knowledge exchange. Innovation forums have highlighted knowledge gaps and opportunities for practice\-based innovation \(some have been supported by N8PRP small grants – see below\). The PCC for Durham evidenced the benefits: *‘Through events, such as the Policing Innovation Forum and the N8PRP’s register of experts, Durham Constabulary has gained a means of accessing research expertise on a plethora of subjects’* **\[B\]**. 

 The Strategy Manager at West Yorkshire Police attested that these platforms create conducive environments for police *‘to mix with academics, partners and fellow practitioners in order to share ideas, good practice and to discuss potential research requirements’* **\[A\]**. Consequently, the Chief Constable of Merseyside confirmed that the Partnership has ‘ *helped to foster police innovations through research, enabled collaborations, provided skills training for analysts and fostered organisational learning across policing*’ **\[C\]**. As a result of this new infrastructure, police forces have changed how they engage with and commission research and use research evidence **\[B,C\]**. West Yorkshire Police cited the N8PRP as a key element in helping embed an evidence\-based approach into their strategic planning process and providing *‘a greater understanding of the scale and nature of our crime and demand threats*’ **\[A\]**. 

 Consequently, evidence is now used more strategically and policing organisations share learning across force areas in new and more effective ways. The former Head of West Yorkshire for Innovation \(based in the PCC’s Office\) confirmed: *‘the framework of the N8PRP has, for the very first time, brought the twelve police forces of the north together where they are now sharing effective practices, discussing operational challenges and identifying common research requirements to better protect the communities they serve’* **\[D\]**. 

 An *Independent Review* of the N8PRP – based on a survey of over 150 officers from participating forces and interviews with 20 senior police officers and PCCs within the participating forces, plus national policing leaders **\[E\]** – found that: awareness of the partnership is high amongst senior staff; establishing the organisational infrastructure for the N8PRP was seen as a significant achievement; and those who used N8PRP ‘products’, such as research reports, conferences and courses, valued them. One interviewee concluded: *‘It* \[N8PRP\] *is a really impressive product… I think the infrastructure that was laid was probably as impressive as I’ve ever seen’* **\[E\]** \[Interviewee 05, p. 13\]. Another stated: *‘The N8 is an example of genuine co\-production…* \[it\] *is probably the best example of a major funding programme to particularly facilitate the relationship between academics and the police... I think the police attitude to research has changed dramatically’* **\[E\]** \[Interviewee 06, p. iv\]. 

 Central to the Partnership’s working has been how Crawford’s research co\-production philosophy **\[4,5,6\]** and practice have fostered organisational change, as highlighted by the Strategy Manager at West Yorkshire Police: *‘co\-produced research is a critical part of us achieving our ambition to be a more innovative and evidence\-based organisation. The co\-produced element is a fundamental principle as it enables the blend of academic rigour with practical policing knowledge. Fundamentally, it allows police professionals to be involved from the onset, to influence the design and content and to ensure that the research is undertaken in a timely manner and most importantly can have practical application’* **\[A\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Enriching the perception, value and use of research\-informed practice in the UK** 

 The Partnership has: raised the profile, understanding and value of research evidence in informing policing; engaged frontline practitioners and managers in creating knowledge, using data and applying research to policing practice; and fostered ‘ *greater recognition and understanding of the importance of policing research*’ **\[F\]**. Police forces have directly gained new knowledge from the Partnership’s activities, including the training programme, innovation forums and the ‘Empowering Data Specialists in Policing’ continuing professional development \(CPD\) programme. Data resources have been put to new uses through data mobilisation events and processes, developed as a direct response to the research finding that data exchange was a key barrier **\[1\]**. 

 In line with the Partnership’s philosophy, the CPD programme was co\-produced and co\-designed by academics and practitioners in the N8PRP **\[G\]**. Across the three cohorts, it has received considerable praise for its knowledge and skills development from participants and \(international\) observers. The *Independent Review* found that the CPD course for data analysts was especially valued, ‘ *with large majorities of participants saying that it had* *improved their understanding of the issues and their knowledge of the evidence base*’ **\[E\]**. 

 Former Lancashire Police Data Analysis and Insight Manager confirmed: ‘ *Perhaps for the first time for many of the participants, police analysts have been exposed to a series of modules that expanded their knowledge and tested their existing skill sets’* **\[G\]**. In recognition of its pioneering contribution, the lead facilitators Fiona McLaughlin \(Leeds\) and Dr Jude Towers \(Lancaster\) were recipients of the 2020  [‘Excellence in Analysis’ Award](https://www.ialeia.org/awards.php) from the International Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts \(IALEIA\). Data analysts have become more active and vocal champions of evidence\-based policing within their organisations **\[G\]**. 

 The Partnership’s small grants programme has helped translate co\-produced research outputs into practice with benefits to end\-users **\[H\]**. This scheme has resourced and sponsored cutting\-edge co\-designed research by inter\-professional teams with a strong focus on application. The College of Policing’s Director of Knowledge & Innovation attested: *‘The small grants programme has offered perhaps the most tangible examples of how research outputs can be translated into impact on policing practice, supporting police\-academic co\-produced research projects on various policing priority areas’* **\[I\]**. The corroboration cites the example of ‘Policing Bitcoin’ \(PI David Wall, Leeds\), which brought together police and academic experts to explore the novel challenges posed by criminal use of bitcoin: *‘The project… helped facilitate practical application of the research findings by translating these into the design and delivery of national training to UK law enforcement leads and other key stakeholders’* **\[I\].** In another example, the Partnership was *‘instrumental’* to impacts derived from the ‘Coercive Control’ project \(PI Charlotte Barlow, Lancaster\) with Merseyside Police, as evidenced by the Chief Constable **\[C\]**. Through such projects, learning has been spread across forces, resulting in benefits from specific research that has made *‘an impact on how forces do business’* **\[J\]** and *‘helped to fill evidence gaps’* **\[H\]**. These have produced benefits to policing and communities. 

 The N8PRP is recognised far beyond its geographical base in the North of England for producing insight and learning. The contribution of Crawford’s research to national policing via the N8PRP was corroborated by the national College of Policing: *‘His critical reflection on his experience of leading N8PRP has provided valuable learning and insight on the key mechanisms and approaches underpinning effective partnership working. Co\-production between police and academics defines the philosophy and strategy of N8PRP, recognising the importance of joint working between partners in bringing about positive change in police culture and practice… N8PRP has made a valuable contribution to the evidence base on effective co\-production… We have been able to draw on this work to inform the support we provide to police\-academic research collaborations across the UK’* **\[I\]**. Crawford’s research consequently ‘ *fed into*’ the College’s ‘ *strategies for embedding evidence\-based practices*’ **\[I\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> is an award\-winning Geographic Information System \(GIS\)\-based domestic energy mapping software. It can rapidly and accurately identify appropriate dwellings for area\-based energy retrofits at a neighbourhood or city scale. It does this by combining a spatial\-mapping\-based, data\-driven approach with innovative data\-reduction techniques. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> creates energy models and assesses the potential for energy retrofit measures on a house\-by\-house basis, which is then scaled up to cover a much larger urban area. 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model has provided a range of environmental, public policy and practice benefits to low\-carbon community organisations, local authorities, architects and householders. These local, national and international benefits have been achieved through: 

-  influencing the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\)’s refined Global Common Carbon Metric \(CCM\) approach 

-  enabling the development of British Standards Institution \(BSI\) standards 

-  facilitating a range of powerful public engagement initiatives 

-  making real energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions \(over 50%\) through energy retrofit measures in existing housing. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Rajat Gupta, Director of both the Low Carbon Building Research Group and Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development at Oxford Brookes University, combined energy modelling and spatial mapping to create the RIBA\-award\-winning \(2006\) Domestic Energy, Carbon Counting and Carbon Reduction Model \(DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>\). DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> is unique in bringing together GIS techniques \(based on MapInfo GIS\) and the Building Research Establishment’s Domestic Energy Model \(BREDEM\-12\). It can rapidly measure, model, map, manage and track domestic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions house by house, and also collect and visualise results on an urban scale, to help local authorities plan area\-based energy retrofits. 

 The background calculations of DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> are performed by BREDEM\-12 and Standard Assessment Procedure \(SAP 2009\), which are dynamically linked. To inform the model, actual home characteristics are gathered from historic and current maps, on\-site street surveys, occupant questionnaires and literature describing home characteristics based on age and typology. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> uses data reduction techniques to assess baseline energy use and evaluate energy savings. It can also assess CO<sub>2</sub> reductions and the cost\-effectiveness \(using life\-cycle costing\) of applying best\-practice energy efficiency strategies and low/zero\-carbon technologies in existing housing for current **\(R1\)** and future climate **\(R2\)**. 

 As part of the **ESRC/EPSRC**  [EVALOC low carbon communities](http://www.evaloc.org.uk/) project \(PI: Gupta, Researcher: Gregg, 2011–2015, GBP1,144,509, ES/I006664/1\) led by Professor Gupta in collaboration with Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, the researchers worked in partnership with six communities who took part in the Department of Environment and Climate Change \(DECC\)’s \(now DBEIS\) GBP10,000,000 Low Carbon Communities Challenge \(LCCC\) programme. EVALOC assessed and explained changes in energy use in the participating communities as a result of their LCCC activities, looking at individual dwellings and the wider community. To help community groups reduce energy use, DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> was used to measure, visualise and communicate energy use for over 1,800 dwellings, both before and after community energy projects. It was also used to predict future carbon savings across the six communities **\(R3\)**. The carbon maps created by the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model gave the local community energy group, local authority and householders visual feedback about energy use. It also provided evidence of community action, and presenting carbon maps at workshops showed that others were also engaged in energy action **\(R4\)**. The EVALOC project also created an EVALOC eNergy And Communities Toolkit \(ENACT\) to enable better public access to briefings, case studies and technical reports arising from the project, including the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> approach and results. 

 Later, in the **Innovate UK**\-funded  [LEMUR](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=132027) \(Local Energy Mapping for Urban Retrofit\) project \(PI: Gupta, Researcher: Gregg, 2015–2016, GBP161,531, project ref: 132027\), the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was further enhanced. It was adapted to use publicly available national and local datasets on housing and energy to quickly identify suitable city neighbourhoods for particular retrofit measures, based on relative energy use and fuel poverty ratings **\(R5\)**. The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was then used to estimate energy use and potential for energy reduction on a house\-by\-house basis. This approach was successfully tested in the town of Bicester, Oxfordshire. 

 Building on the LEMUR project, the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model was applied as part of the **EU ERDF**\-funded  [OxFutures](http://oxfutures.org/projects/) project \(Co\-I: Gupta, 2017–2020, the total value GBP1,599,810\) to identify fuel\-poor neighbourhoods with high energy use, covering over 2,000 dwellings in five district councils of Oxfordshire **\(R6\)**. The findings were used by community organisations such as Low Carbon Hub to increase take\-up of home energy improvements. Findings from the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–LEMUR project have been used to develop a county\-wide future energy planning tool in collaboration with Oxfordshire County Council as part of the **Innovate UK** Local Energy Oxfordshire \(LEO\) project \(Co\-I: Gupta, 2019–2022, the total value GBP13,788,087, project ref: 104781\). 

 DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research is being adapted for use in India, to build community energy models of 2,000 homes across five cities. It will be used to evaluate the potential for deployment of energy\-saving measures and rooftop solar, as part of the **EPSRC/Indian Department of Science and Technology \(DST\)**\-funded  [RESIDE](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/about-brookes/news/researchers-receive-major-grant-to-help-improve-the-energy-efficiency-of-millions-of-homes-in-india/) project \(PI: Gupta 2017–2022, GBP1,300,000 million: GBP772,178 from EPSRC and the remainder from DST, EP/R008434/1\) on residential building energy demand reduction in India.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model, EVALOC and subsequent research projects have had a considerable and sustained impact on environmental policy. They have also improved community and public engagement. Both of these things have improved housing energy performance. The following examples demonstrate these benefits. 

 **Informing policies and practice** 

 Principles of the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research have underpinned the development of tools, protocols and practices. Through his role as technical advisor, Professor Gupta piloted and refined UNEP’s Global Common Carbon Metric \(CCM\) approach through the Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative. The CCM protocol has been developed as an ISO standard on carbon metrics of buildings \(ISO/TC 59/SC17\) **\(S1\)**. As a member of the steering committee, Professor Gupta applied DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>’s principles of accounting carbon emissions from all energy end uses in dwellings in the BSI’s ‘UK PAS 2060 Specification of the demonstration of carbon neutrality’ **\(S2\)**, and this was taken up by nearly 100 organisations. 

 The EVALOC project was profiled as an exemplar case study in the DECC’s National Community Energy Strategy \(2014\), and DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> was highlighted as a carbon mapping tool that is key to helping community groups reduce energy use by measuring, visualising and communicating house\-by\-house energy use and the potential for carbon savings **\(S3\)**. 

 Findings from DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>’s research within the EVALOC and LEMUR projects have been presented regularly \(2014, 2015 and 2016\) to senior members of the Energy Efficiency Deployment Unit \(EEDO\) in DECC, and used to inform policy development in the field of community/local energy and household energy use. In September 2015, Professor Gupta was invited by Scottish Government officials working in the community energy sector to share the evaluation approach adopted in the EVALOC project. The action research approach influenced the Scottish Government’s evaluation protocols for measuring the impact of community energy initiatives. 

 The Construction Leadership Council’s Green Construction Board’s report **\(S4\)** explicitly highlighted the EVALOC tools and datasets \(created by the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> model on monitoring and evaluation of household energy use\) and awarded them the highest score \(four out of four\) for future usefulness in understanding housing energy use. 

 **Improving community engagement** 

 The findings from the EVALOC–DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> research have been used by community organisations and community energy projects. Community\-based organisations involved in the Eco\-Easterside project used evidence from EVALOC to support a successful funding bid worth £1 million. The participants who were provided with energy feedback in the six carbon mapping workshops were more motivated to adopt energy\-saving behaviours and to undertake further retrofit measures \(from draught\-proofing and re\-dressing the mortar joints in external walls, to fitting solar PV panels\). EVALOC fed directly into a collaborative Knowledge Exchange project \(Monitoring and Evaluation for Sustainable Communities\), which trialled a variety of EVALOC’s monitoring and evaluation tools to enable rapid learning among members of Transition Network and Low Carbon Communities Network **\(S5\)**. 

 The community engagement and household recruitment methodology developed in the EVALOC project were applied in an Innovate UK\-funded project, Energy Resources for Integrated Communities \(ERIC\), to encourage householders to store and share solar\-generated electricity. The ERIC project installed solar photovoltaic \(PV\) systems and smart batteries in 82 dwellings in a neighbourhood in Oxford, resulting in generation of 117 MWh per year \(over 25 years\) of solar electricity and increased self\-consumption of PV electricity from 51% on average to 65% per year. The project also won two prestigious national energy awards in 2016 **\(S6\)**. 

 **Extending public engagement** 

 Many public engagement activities, including workshops, advice stalls and open exhibitions, were undertaken throughout the EVALOC project. For a national interactive exhibition, ‘A Sense of Energy’, the EVALOC installation used thermal imaging and DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> carbon mapping to ‘visualise’ energy **\(S7\)**. Airbrushing the colours normally seen in a thermal image on to a doll’s house was an innovative way of demonstrating heat losses from a typical Victorian terrace, as well as providing recommendations on how to reduce them. DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> carbon mapping showed the changes in a community’s estimated domestic household energy use, before and after local community energy action. The public exhibitions ran in London in July 2014 and in Cardiff from September to October 2014. In Cardiff, the exhibition included workshops and gave visitors the chance to talk to researchers. The EVALOC thermally imaged doll’s house installation has been used in local public events in Oxford, including the 2015 OUTBURST festival, where it attracted attention as part of the welcome exhibit aimed at designers, managers and developers in the construction industry. 

 The ENACT toolkit on the EVALOC website was devised to promote public access to the findings in easy\-to\-understand briefings, case studies and technical reports **\(S8\)**. The EVALOC website was viewed 5,231 times, with 612 returning visitors between March 2015 and March 2016. This is in comparison to only 2,645 total views prior to the ENACT toolkit being launched \(April 2012 to February 2015\). The visitors to the site are believed to be a mix of community practitioners and building industry personnel who are interested in monitoring and evaluating the impacts of community energy initiatives and energy retrofits. 

 **Achieving real CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions** 

 The DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> approach has been applied in advanced low\-carbon refurbishments of three Innovate UK\-funded ‘Retrofit for the future’ projects by Oxford Brookes University. Of these, one project \(Oxford Whole House Carbon Reduction\) achieved 80% carbon emission, with wide media coverage, and was the only case study profiled by Innovate UK \(formerly TSB\) in its ‘Retrofit analysis’ report **\(S9\)**. Through the DECC\-funded Local Energy Assessment Fund \(2012\), DECoRuM<sup>®</sup> enabled a local community in Bicester to prepare for the National Green Deal programme. During the assessment period, it allowed the community to assess the potential for applying costed refurbishment packages, based on a combination of best\-practice energy\-saving measures and low\-carbon technologies. Findings from the DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–Bicester model were used directly to install cavity and wall insulation in 42 dwellings, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> savings of least 50tCO<sub>2</sub> per year **\(S10**\). 

 Since 2018, DECoRuM<sup>®</sup>–India models in the RESIDE project have been developed to target the deployment of energy demand reduction measures \(insulation, shading, low\-energy cooling/heating systems\) combined with rooftop solar, across five Indian cities. Findings are being used to inform the assessment of the residential energy code that will impact the energy performance of 100 million homes in the next 10 years.
